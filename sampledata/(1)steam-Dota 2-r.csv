When we're not together, I miss her. When we're together, we eventually realize that it's not going to work, and then we break up. Rinse and repeat.

She keeps imposing her presence on me, reminding me in subtle ways that she's always there. Or, should I say, I'm the one that keeps coming back? At this point, I don't know anymore.

I hate her and I love her. I hate that I love her. It's complicated."

Of course you can just mute everyone from the start and just enjoy the game as it is because is really a great game but after all these hours this game is less and less fun because of toxic people.

I also played lol a lot and even tho i like dota more, i know that in lol there are enough punishments for toxic peoples but nobody seems to care about it. Basically when you report someone they will send you the recording of the match to complete like a quality form and send it back again, like work for their quality team and lose your time doing that with 0 payment....

This could've been way better than what it became."

348,buen juego
349,good
350,"SUPER SHORT: If you are considering this game, DON'T. Don't start playing it. It is a waste of time, but you only discover it after long time. 

It is like a toxic relationship, that lures you with pretty looks (number of players and esport scene), then waits for you to be fully committed... only to cheat on you.

--------

SUMMARY:
1. It takes hundreds of hours to learn, for casual gamer it can take months or a year to play at a decent level.
2. When you finally get good, you realize that matchmaking is horribly flawed and there are high numbers of cheaters (either people trolling/griefing others or smurfs, people with multiple accounts who pretend they are lower rank/skill level than they really are)
3. Most people I know and spent years playing this, are quitting, not because game sucks (game is great), but because of the inability of devs to make the matches balanced and fun. They seems unable to get rid of cheaters/griefers.

--------

LONG VERSION:

1. Lack of satisfaction: 
So after you invested so many hours, years in the game, you will discover that matches are becoming more and more unsatisfactory. Either you will feel that your wins are unjustified, because some smurf helped you win the game (with minimal effort). Or you lose 5, 6, 10 games in a row in many cases to people with abnormal win rates (probably smurfs).

It is like going to play basketball after work, but instead of nice game you get a semi-pro, try-hard player that scores all throws and never passes to you, while insulting everyone. No matter if you are in winning or losing team, this is really not fun.

2. Cheating spiral: 
What is worse, is that you will notice that people you know will also start smurfing. They will do it because they are trying to escape higher rank smurfs in their games, so they pretend they are lower level, and then it spirals into honest people needing to cheat to enjoy the game.

It is almost impossible to find a winning weekend championship team that doesnt heavily smurf, they all do that (including people I know). And because everyone does it, there is more and more pressure on other people to do it as well. Normal and Turbo modes that should be laid back and casual are now also full of smurfs who faced with imbalanced ranked are moving to those modes to score easy wins, which kills casual fun in those modes as well.

3. It is so easy to be toxic and cheat in dota 2:
What is worse is how easy it is to smurf, have multiple accounts, or grief people and how little punishment you get even if you get caught. You can destroy many games (each game being 9 other people so you can easily destroy fun of 100s of people, before you get a warning, or moved to low priority games (which in two or three hours bring you back). If you want to piss off other people because your life is miserable, then this game is for you, you can destroy fun for hundreds of people before anyone notices or does anything, and even then, you just can easily start from scratch in few hours.

--------

MISSING SOLUTIONS:
1. With all that game data I am surprised that developers cannot create a more automated way to scan and flag suspicious accounts. We all know what XPM/GPM, win rates etc are per hero per mmr bracket, if someone plays too good then moved them higher or flag as potential smurf. 

2. Why MMR is just based on winning the whole game? Why it doesn't reward players for playing well, even if they lose. Then you can get rid or at least minimize mentality that winning is all that counts. Reward someone with positive MMR if they perform better than they usually do, reward placing wards as supports, GPM for cores etc. We already do it through silly challenges, so why not do it for MMR. Give people some fun and recognition. Give them something to try and enjoy even if there is a cheater/griefer in a game.

3. Why there is no paid version (not gimmicky dota+ but a real premium version). I would happily pay extra to play only people who also paid and risk more if they account gets banned or suspended. Also with that extra money you could actually fund some decent support team to review games and accounts. It would be win-win, you get people who committed to the game and you get resources to make the game a better experience. Keep game free for people who cannot afford it or just want to try it, but make a premium tier for people who dont want to deal with emotional kids, smart ass cheaters and general toxicity associated with moba games.




CLOSING WORDS:
It is so sad to see community management in such a poor state, I play dota for nearly 20 years and in terms of quality of games the Dota 1, community approach (ban systems, moderators, leagues) was so much better than the centralized, multimillion system of dota 2. 

Dota is one of the greatest games in video game history, and somehow the current management has managed to make it unfun, frustrating experience. 

It is not like dota was perfect before, but seeing so little progress and in many cases deterioration is disheartening. I love dota but if I could choose to spend my 7 000 hours (really closer to 12k with dota 1) on playing 20 other great games vs just spending it on dota, I would probably do that and have more fun. This is also a smart thing to do for any new players and this is why you should not start playing dota."

411,"I didn't play a whole lot, but after coming to this from League of Legends its just not what you expect. I guess this game is more for the nostalgia bros, which is a perfectly fine reason. I know Dota had the concept for this kinda game first, so I give it a medal for that. Plus, despite not interacting with the community at all, my guess is its a lot less toxic than League. Plus, the developers are Valve, so they probably have their heads screwed on right unlike Riot. All that aside, this game was incredibly confusing and not explained very well. No tutorial at all. If I hadn't just come from a different RTS game, it would have been a nightmare. So much to learn and understand, it would probably be ten times easier if I had started playing a long time ago. The things I think league has better are the character design, lore, combat, its more visually appealing, more straightforward, has a tutorial, better map design, easier to understand, and I think they have just fleshed out the concept of this kind of game better. So despite the toxic community and crackhead developers, I would recommend League of Legends over this game."

582,"Disclaimer: Despite my low play time on Steam, I've played pre-Reforged WC3 and early HotS as well as other RTS.

I can only recommend this to three kinds of people:
A- People who are under the age of 21 (You don't work for more than 7 hours; and get months off at a time)
B- People who have played Warcraft 3 a lot
C- Returning players who know what they're getting into (League of Legends and Heroes of the Storm count for this)

-You have a certain ""build order"" for each character but if you don't know what the numbers mean, you're going to get killed by the guy who does (sometimes as fast as the instant he enters your periphery vision). It's not enough to know about the problem, your hero has to either be able to take care of it or keep someone else's unit alive.

- The HUD is very cluttered compared to Heroes and WC3 itself. A lot of the default settings are actually extremely useful, but attempt to address the problem by throwing suggestions into the player's face and outright making it difficult to browse ""normally"" (If you have to actively dissuade new players from trying; and make it so hard for those of us who want to; why even have the feature?)

Very fun game overall; but I cannot recommend it to anyone unless they dedicate the time to engage in guides/tutorials.
You also should not play this game unless you know you have at least an hour of spare time (and you will be penalized for leaving early.)"

My son recently downloaded Counter Strike and in less than a week, he had already played for over 20 hours. This was terrible for me, as it was already hard enough for me to spend time with my son, as he is always out with his friends or just watching videos on Tiktok. So I decided to make a Steam account and get this game to see if I could maybe play alongside him. I loaded into the game, did the tutorial but I was stuck on what you where supposed to do. I asked my Son for help and he hosted a game for me to join. I loved it as it was the best time I had spent with my Son since my wife had died. This game has ever since brought my son and I closer again and now we actually spend time together outside the house as well. This game reminded me that there's fun to be had in everything, and it has brought both me and my Son many happy memories."

I wanted to quit but the sad thing is Dota just makes every other game seem lazy. Whenever a new game comes out, I usually can stay excited for about it for a while but then that sneaky feeling comes back. ""It's not Dota, but it's decent"" is usually how I feel about new games nowadays. Something just keeps me coming back. I love the Overwatch system, replays of every game and pro games, and ability to completely customize your experience with arcade games and other game modes. Dota offers everything and it only asks you to offer everything in return. What a game, wish I found it 10 years ago!"

I understand from forums that there are some calculations that are being made when they create the party, i know i have around 5800 score watever that score means lol i have 2000hours of gameplay in a decade and never misbehave or leave a game, or not playing my role, so to take this waiting time as a punishment that i dont know about what im being punished for is kinda weird, specially when i have the option to stop playing and find other distractions, why would i accept this ""punishment"" when i always have the option to not accept it lol anyway... bad game design to make people wait so much in a queue if you ask me, and ofcourse this will lead to alot of ""uninstals"", but why wouldnt you just ban someone for 24 hours or sumething if they leave the game or watever they do, at least next day it will have a chance to think twice before he does watever it did to get the ban for, but to just place people in so long queues everytime you want to play a short game(20-40 for me is a short gameplay)as a form of punishment and you dont even know why you are pusnished for, its just a slow but sure way to make people stop playing at all"

829,"Dota 2.
Among the best games I've ever played. And somehow it has reached my highest played game. (time wise).

I'm Not Recommending this for one reason and one reason only.

The battle pass is a huge problem.
1. Cash-grab???
- Dota is a free to play game. which is commendable. And i know they have to create income somehow. But this year's battle pass wasn't even half finished when they released it and began selling ""levels"" to gain the prizes for it. (Many of these prizes are seasonal and expire at the end of the battle pass. Much of the content is unfinished that it's honestly kind of sickening. - it's kind of like they're selling things and then giving you an IOU. It reminds me of the mindset of every early access title I've ever purchased and been disappointed by.
I cant say that this is for sure a cash grab, but it has the bitter bitter taste and look of the cash grabs I've seen in the past.

I've seen different games die from cash grab schemes. If Dota isn't making a profit at this point, let your players know. I guarantee i'd have chipped in more to save games i loved in the past when they started going under. But they never said anything, and before anyone could do anything, they simply shut down.


2. Matchmaking -- It is BROKEN at the moment.
You're getting veteran players matched with brand new people who don't even know how not stand under a tower and get shot to death. That isn't terribly uncommon, but it's much much worse since the battle pass was released.
Here's an example. yesterday i played with 4 other long-time players and we were all against 4 brand new players and 1 other veteran.
It was a blood bath.
And now, for the past few days, every game has been a one-sided crap shoot.
it just isn't fun anymore..
and i never thought I'd quit Dota... but if something doesn't change, I will.

3. The battle pass Cavern Crawl.
It is a good idea in theory but the application of it has horrid results on experiences in matches.
The cavern crawl is basically a challenge to use different heroes in 3 different categories in order to obtain a cosmetic item.
All that is fine and good. But this just causes people to play heroes they don't have any idea how to play. That's not too bad 
 on a normal day when it's just one or two people deciding to try something new. But with the incentive of the cavern crawl, 8 out of 10 people are playing a new hero they dont know how to use, it results in chaos that doesnt usually end up being fun. And this is worse in the first month of the battle pass, but it will continue until it is over.

4. To be continued."
830,BAD
831,it is an awesome game
832,.
833,"If the game is not fun, why bother?
If it's not balanced, why compete?
If you have no agency on wins or losses, why learn to become better?

It lasted long enough and has a decent monetization system (if you ignore how greedy the battlepasses are... but you can play the game 100% for free, which is better than I can say for most other mobas - no unlocking anything bullshit) But besides that, there's not the necessary components for an enjoyable experience - even when playing with friends. 

The problem stems from balancing issues (understandable given how many characters are in and how often they change stuff to try and keep it ""fresh""), and the ""skill"" based matchmaking system. Much like so many other games of this generation (like CSGO, Overwatch, Apex Predators, etc.), the matchmaking is intentionally designed to condition you, much like an addict, into playing after the ""perfect"" matches, which fundamentally, you have no control over a win or a loss. It's random. 

Win a few matches in a row? The system puts you in matches where your team mates are considerably worse than the enemy and don't even speak your language, while the enemy team is a 5 stack of cooperating in voice call teammates of much higher rank than you. 
Lose a few games in a row? The game puts you in the opposite situation, where you are destroying the enemy team, to the point where there is no challenge, and you wonder what is going on. 
Either of those, unlike what the more hardcore and perhaps dilusional fanbase will defend, do not contribute to either a pleasant or fun gaming experience, nor do they allow any skill growth.

The fact that the community is inherently extremely toxic, added with the competitive and frustrating nature of the game, lends itself to even friends frequently having attrition and arguments during sessions.

Valve makes (?) great games, and their MOBA was no exception, mechanically, visually and so on, but this game is no longer, in my opinion, worth playing."

903,"This game has WAY too steep of a learning curve, everyone's as social as a rock, (meaning no one talks at all in game) and guess what? you leave a match because you had to get lunch? BANNED. Now you can only play in the low priority pool, where you can only choose from 3 random heros, and the matches take YEARS to queue into. Not saying the normal game modes take years to queue into, too.. Matches last TOO long, if you want to play you better be prepared to stay in one match for the next 8 hours of your day. If you leave because you get tired, you get BANNED and put into the low priority pool... Basically ALL heros are underpowered, and then there are like 2 or 3 heros that are actually good. But guess what? Theyll all be taken by the time you move your mouse over the hero's icon. And if you leave because you can't choose a damn hero that wont get one-shot or wont take 5 years to kill another hero, guess what? BANNED. Look, I love Valve as a company. I love all their games. I have 1k hours on TF2 and basically live it. I love playing CSGO. I love the Half Life series. But dota 2 is just not for me, and if your someone who is not willing to invest years to even learn the basics of a game like this, I also don't think this game is for you."

I much prefer DOTAs trees to the walls of most other MOBA/ARTS games. Also every hero can be played in any role.

New player experience isn't great as you will be matchmade against regular players as opposed to new ones.
New player mindset should be set on learning the heroes. I can recommend demoing a hero and checking out an in-game guide before playing them.

Compared to other MOBA/ARTS games, DOTA has an excellent and feature packed client, and all heroes are unlocked."

1036,"First of all, if you come from league, this game is not for you. In league, you face maybe 5-10 seconds of CC at MOST during a teamfight, and thats with a CC heavy composition. In dota, 5 seconds is a basic autoattack stun. Be prepared for the most horrific CC you have ever seen in any game. so how are you supposed to counter a 60 second DOOM ultimate ability for example? A ultimate ability that silences and mutes you for 60 seconds, while dealing damage. You are forced to build an item that counters that ONE ability, and hope you can use that item before he casts an ult on you. Absolultely horrific game design and balance. the power creep of new champions is some of the most horrendous garbage ive ever seen. The variety of items basically allows any champion to do anything, there are items that let you blink large distances, make you immune, refresh all your cooldowns, crowd control the whole team. Its atrociously overwhelming how much nonsense you have to worry about. Playing this game will give you a ruptured blood vessel. I've went through at least 3 keyboards playing this abbhorrent steaming pile of depression. And I dont see myself stopping anytime soon, this game is more addicting than gambling. You sit through a 1 hour match of being TRASHCANNED because one of your teammates fed the horrendously broken carry champion, and yet you still queue again afterwards. Because there is a small glimmer of hope your next team isnt as braindead as the last. Unfortunately when you get up to higher elo, the player pool is so small that if you see a griefer or feeder, you are stuck with that player forever. Theres not enough people in high elo, it's the same drooling roaches. Anyways, this game will cause you severe depression and mental disorders from prolonged play, download at your own risk."

1041,"dont play this, make u so strest when u play it in asia server"
1042,"Edit: This became more of a rant and feedback to the community and developers, rather than a review. To anyone reading; this is not a pros and cons list. Enjoy.

Regardless of the hours I've put into this game, I can not recommend it but to one tiny fraction of players, because the issues do not show up clearly or a new players can't even comprehend them early enough. This is a warning from a casual to another. Maybe it's just me getting older and finding better things to do than to listen to a bunch of ungrateful, entitled kids acting out their lack of confidence and false bravado.

The toxicity of this game is mind-boggling. ""Boo-hoo""? Anyone who claims, I complain for no reason, must be either one of the toxic little kids or a sad, sweaty troll hating life and everything about it. And saying ""filthy casual"" indicates the fact; you have no place in the public gaming community. Go play with yourself and your 1337.

Can you enjoy drugs? Yes, you can. Should you? No, you probably shouldn't. Like with this game, the problems don't show up early enough to stop. I did my share of recreational mind-bending and stopped before it got out of hand, but I can't say I stopped this game before I noticed how many hours of my life I wasted on it. Sure I had a lot of good times, and it was a way to connect with my friends since I was the moving type, from country to country in the past 8 years. But looking back now, I realize, and I wish I had spent my time more wisely - on something genuinely productive. In the past 6 months I've cut down to a random game once a week.

Is this game playable, can you enjoy it? Yes, of course, but should you play it? Probably not, if you're not determined to go win the championship one day, or in general make money playing it. Anyone who is not committing them self 100% to this game will not progress beyond a certain point, and the older you get the harder it becomes. After enough years you will probably reach the same conclusion as me. You have to study the game, watch pro-gameplay, read guides, follow meta, follow patches, learn the roles of yourself and others... and mute everyone most of the time, if you want to win in the long run and keep your cool, if you want to get to the top. If you can do all this, then by all means, go at it. This game is so damn difficult for a few reasons, and I guess that is a big part of the charm.

It is definitely up for debate, what the core reason is for the daily number of players playing this game dropping so drastically since 2016. There are plenty of reasons. But apart from the above mentioned; the fact developers are not spending enough time and money eliminating the players from this game who create secondary accounts, boosters, sellers, buyers, but instead lure in more players, new, gullible, clueless little Bambies, with no idea what they're getting into - is a top subject. 

I wouldn't mind a ""smurf"" in the game, if there was 1 on both teams always, I actually think it could help, if cores would always be from higher ranks, maybe pos 1 and 2, since the game depends on their success, with the help of the rest of course.

""It's not that simple you filthy casual"", Yes, no **** Sherlock. But it's what they need to fix asap, I don't care how. 

""It's free to play, you don't even have to pay to play it"". Yeah, that's the bait. The flashy skins and the addictive, competitive nature of the game, like chess, is the hook, line and sinker. If you can't see this, then I recommend you go educate yourself a bit.

After years of casual playing, I got to the 3rd tier basically without ""trying"", but as for anyone who can reflect on their own mistakes and adapt to each game individually, it is possible to rank up with a relatively small amount of effort and even have fun while doing it. What I noticed tho, is that people are only worse here :D
I want to rank down (and eventually I did), not because I want it easier, but because there was more sense of team-effort and unity than in the rank above and the games were simply more fun, even if we lost in the end. 
Maybe we need a second ranked lobby for casuals like myself...

There must be some psychological explanation, to the mindset of players in each rank, what their motive and thought-process is, what they're trying to get out of the game and why they flip out so much, while not even necessarily knowing what is going on, apart from: ""it's not my fault we are losing"". I had this thought: Maybe people in Crusader (3rd tier), think they are damn pros now, they have ascended from Herald and Guardian - ""mein gott I must be a god now, kneel before me peasant, I can play mid Anti-Mage like any other top-tier player and all my supports are trash because I saw a video on youtube from my tiny smartphone while playing whack-a-mole between the sheets."" ....But I digress.

Without bragging, this is just for insight, it's not that I wouldn't know my role as a support, for ****s sake I got nearly 8k commendations so I must be doing something right, even when I miss pulling a camp or not being next to my core exactly when needed (remember communication) and yes I was not fast enough to Shallow Grave my cores because, hey, I'm just nub. But people are flaming each other for the smallest things, focusing on the others game so much they lose control of their own. Try to calm someone down, you get reported for not stfu, or they abandon the game. The amount people tilt, is incredible. Nobody keeps it cool. Everyone knows better than the rest, and feel the need to speak their mind, but never feel the need to assess the information they have or make conclusions based on the information at hand. I can't remember who said this but it was a fairly good question; would you run into a pitch-black forest without a flashlight, knowing that somewhere, in there, are monsters who want to kill you? ""Oh look some camps to fa........."" And then it's my fault they are dead.

Do they need to turn off communication completely for this game to work?? What do you do with kids who can't use their toys and games the way they are meant to be used: take them away. Simple. IF you really think about it, you don't need the chat for anything, since most of the time chat is being used to flame others. You can use the ping wheel, look at the map, draw your plan which lane to push or where to fall back to. You can point-click where you are going. These are great tools, improve them, educate people on using these tools, anything - but please take away team chat, voice and text, to protect everyone. I swear 90% of its use is for toxic bs. Like Pablo Francisco once said: ""I love Spaghetti, but it got shit on it!"". The game is pure gold but it's ruined by so much crap on top.

And that is why I can not recommend this game.

After reading this review/rant and before posting it I had some reflecting to do, I understand some people will take what I write as a personal attack at them, see it as an old boomers whingeing, an insult and probably feel the need to troll. And this is expected, it's the internet and it breeds people like this. Or society. So have at it.

Like I said, it's hard to say what the core reason is for this game being something you should avoid like the plague. I love the game, but in retrospect; I wish I never started playing it. It's a love and hate relationship. 

This has been my two cents on the matter, my experience with the game and the conclusion I've reached.

I'll allow the comments, so people can prove my point for me."

1169,"Battle Pass is literally money grubbing. Content is few and far between and part 2 is released after the tournament so ALL proceeds go to Valve instead of the teams and the scene. Really? 
Literally get tens of millions of dollars of revenue only to send Panel members to Norway and not even to the main event. Literally millions and millions of dollars and yet the organisers think its okay to do this? Alongside the decision to okay an official betting partner? Seriously? Money. Grubbing.

Valve has lost the plot this year. Absolutely abhorrent decisions. Bring back old Valve where they cared about this game."

That is when you know this game has corrupted you, you will keep coming back and fight psychological war games in chat while trying to ward for your goddamn carry so he stops dying in that one jungle camp.

If you've not played before, I highly recommend playing with a group of friends - You will very likely not have a lot of idea whats going on in your first couple of matches, but you will learn in due course. People can be somewhat critical when you start out but don't worry about that, just mute them if they are giving you too much of a hard time.

The outcome of this ending has only 2, either lose trashtalked by your opponent, or win, and play another game with bigger chance of losing. Play this game at your own risk.

1467,"During my time playing this game, it has changed me. I originally played this game for the fun of trying something new, and ultimately got frustrated and stopped playing. The game in its current state makes me upset for the constant cash grab style that it is for the ability to ""be better"" at the game. I cannot deny the fun it was doing the compendiums during their times and the battle pass in its early stages, but after so many changes being made to the game. I cannot force myself to play this anymore. 

If you can get past the hatred of the toxic community towards newbies and the constant uneven matchmaking then you can enjoy a well designed base game. It is complex and very strategic but also ""RNG-based"" at times. 

I have made a many friends on this platform, but after it is all said and done, I can't stand playing this game anymore.

To you who dare brave this sad land of torment, may your soul be purified in the light of a thousand suns, for this darkness shall not cease its wake in its path to attract all those who pass under its gaze. 
I look back at this valley of death and see only the corpses of those who have fallen to its unholy charm; and on their faces are smiles of pleasure in the toxic ooze. Good luck travelers. May your battles be heroic."

This game is a dedicate hard fought war against 5 other players as one among 5. You will see acts, practices, and choices that will define the foundations of your entire game occur over seconds.

This was horrible for me, as it was already hard for me to find ways to spend time with my son, as he is always out with his friends or just watching YouTube. So I decided to make a Steam account and get this game to see if I could maybe play alongside him. I loaded into the game, picked my character and started playing but I was stuck on what you where supposed to do. I asked my Son for help and he hosted a game for me to join. I loved it as it was the best time I had spent with my Son since my wife had died. This game has ever since brought me and my son closer again and now we actually spend time together outside the house together as well."

1547,"Where to begin? Dota 2 is such a horrible balanced game. It's been over 5 years and they still didn't fix the game.

Imagine when you sit in the design room and think about game balance, where the matchmaking is complete garbage and can't come up with a balanced team.

When one hero gets so fed, he can solo the entire team and be basically immortal 1 vs 5.

The gap from dying is so huge you can just give up. But the garbage developers didn't add a forfeit option, so you literally have to sit 60+ minutes every game waiting to lose.

No matter how stacked a hero gets it shouldn't be possible to solo an entire team. It is a team game. Just pick a broken hero and solo feed on the bad players and you have an instant win, and the other team can do nothing to counter it.

And let's not even go into how many trolls there are in this game. They literally love to be cancerous and ruin your games while you try to win 1 vs 5.

Is that fun? No."
1548,The game has no unity. Plus a lot of toxic players It's better to play other games. Enough with this game.

Should create more minigames for long time players
But in terms of updates, should lower down the damage output of all heroes, they go up and up in damage which makes the game less strategic. (before you had to calculate everything until the last hit before a fight, now all heroes have damage, stuns, extra skills and this makes the game scary for fights and many players just hide until they gear up)"

1670,"This is honestly an amazing game. The reason for the negative review is the community. Every game you will have someone that complains about everything. Your teams winning you will have a person being condescending about everything you do. In an unranked match trying to learn the game you know it condescending teammate crying about everything even when you  are at the top off the team and they are last. I find the only reason you will ever not want to play this game is the players, every game you play you are guaranteed to have people that can't just play as a team and feel the need to type in chat whole game complaining. Might be surprising to some but you are going to lose some games ... it happens and another big surprise complaining the whole game won't get you a win. I wish Valve would do more to deal with these people that are like individuals that just go into retail stores to complain for attention. Amazing game let down by a lot of crappy people."

1679,"battle pass 2022 is an utter joke. Its getting more and more low effort. Valve makes $5M within 24h and all you get is a copy-pasted reskinned battle pass, where half of the stuff that's in there is ""coming soon"" with no info as to what it's gonna be like. 

They removed a lot of possibilities to grind for levels as well, weeklies now hardly get you anywhere, and because there's no aghs labyrinth or bonus game, you can't get progression through that either. 
It seems to me that valve are trying to see and push the limits as to how much they can milk their players of their money. 
If I could refund the battle pass, trust me, I would. 

I can't wait to get see copy pasted diretide also, where they will probably have brilliant ideas like with nemestice. Give the candy pots a 100% backdoor protection so no one can steal the candy, because newer players could be offended over the evil strategies that people who actually played the game for more than 2 hours use.

Also: matchmaking is a joke. Google ""dota forced 50% winrate"" if you wanna know more. Valve devs said ""no no, we don't do that"", but at the same time I get matchmade with completely new players (literally something like 30 games, not smurfs either) while my enemies have 5k+ games ü§°ü§°ü§°"

i definitely recommend it if you wanna get into mobas and you have tough skin to get through the early learning.

personally i won't be playing more of the game  because of the toxic community i experienced but for anyone that can put up with constant insults through the game and the occasional team in base telling the opponents to end then i definitely recommend Dota. 

underneath the toxic surface of the community (or at least what my limited experience of it has led me to believe) is a complex and well designed game that deserves your time and definitely deserves for you to at least give it a go - even if you uninstall after a few games. 

In summary: it's not the game for me but it has the potential to be your number one."

1858,"I've played this game a lot so I think I have a pretty decent idea of where it all went wrong. This game was good in beta prior to the greedy free-to-play business model, equality of outcome matchmaking system (lobby system is superior), cosmetics (hats), rampant rise in scripting/cheating/smurfing, and paywalls for simple QOL features (dota plus, avoid list). Over the years the game has received less and less developer attention all while players dump more and more money into it. It's not worth playing for veteran players and is definitely not worth playing if you are a new player. The truth is...this game just isn't fun anymore. While this game isn't dead per se, it's undead via the free-to-play business model. Players may dump their money into it but this game is on life support. It's only a matter of time before a new and better MOBA comes out. It's time players vote with their wallets and their feet and stop playing this game. I don't think there is anything that could convince me that this game is going to make a comeback, the developers have had years and years to address issues and have failed miserably. Let it die."
1859,"As someone who moved over from League of Legends, I could no recommend this game enough. It was rather quick to pick up and start seeing results. Not having to spend time buying hero's like you have to do within league or other free to play services really has made playing more enjoyable. On top of that having the ability to play support or an offrole and not feeling entirely useless all game was quite refreshing as well."

1873,"Sure, game is fun, but Valve is probably one of the most money-hungry, greedy and community-neglecting videogame companies in the industry. Remember that if you're spending any amount of money on this game, none of it is going into giving back anything to you, the costumer. Think twice before giving in any of your earnings to this people."

2019,"This game is without any doubt the most random gaming experience ever made. It has 120 heroes each with four or more abilities and you need to understand how to mix and match and play versus each of them. This will take years to comprehend and practice. So do not take this game lightly it punishes stupidity in severe and brutal ways. And DO NOT START PLAYING RANKED until you have mastered at least 2 support heroes that you can use to help your mmr to go up unless you will be sentenced to Herald hell where no one playes their role and will literally lose a game to prove their point; that your mom in fact, really is a ****."

2202,"DOTA Spieler sind unter mir. Der Boden ist auch unter mir.
DOTA Spieler sind noch ein ganzes St√ºck weit drunter aber trotzdem d√ºrfen sie mit mir auf ihm rumlaufen.
Zweieinhalb meter drunter w√§re der Sweet Spot - ohne Blumen, ohne Stein, ohne Christlichen Beistand.
Ich w√ºrde George Soros' schimmligen Judenschwengel lutschen damit er DOTA 2 kauft und l√∂scht.
Ich w√ºrde NPD w√§hlen damit DOTA spieler systematisch verfolgt und auf Industriellem Ma√üstab ihrer letztendlichen Bestimmung zugef√ºhrt werden."
2203,"When I first started DOTA2 I was a little overwhelmed, as my first ARTS / MOBA game it was pretty complicated. I soon started to pick up the mechanics like last hitting and denying. Before I knew it, I was performing better and better. I stopped making silly mistakes and I got vastly better at not feeding the enemy team. For the most part, everyone I've met was very helpful and nice, there have sometimes the jerk however. As I continue to play DOTA2 more and more, I'm sure I'll continue to improve. I recommend this game for all"
2204,Never gets old. Hopefully Kids nowadays get to experience how fun this game is.

2206,"If you want a happy peaceful life. If you want a long life. If you want to wake up happy, go to bed happy and take a shit happy. 
STAY OFF DOTA 2. Good luck."
2207,"I played it a little, fun game."
2208,tawe
2209,Dota2 itself is a greaaaat game and imo one of the best games in history. However most players are so toxic and they don't really welcome new players. Wish there are more features around muting toxic players or just let toxic players playing against each other.

I have been the same way for years now, you join and theres literally not a single hero that excites you anymore. And i assume its easy to assume its players fault, but no. its developments fault and its fucking miserable, I cant imagine how it takes a multimillion developer team to take about a years to come up with one hero...

they feel a huge need to 'protect' their pro scene, which is a joke and just a huge hint they are afraid not to be able to manage it all, because they are weak group of nerds.

Just throw in money and you damn pro scene will always flourish, and you lose way more money by disinterested long time players leaving, than fucking caring about how puppey reacts to a new hero role in the current meta... shambles for sheep..."

2441,"DOTA 2 is the King of MOBA's. Nothing comes close. In both it's good and bad aspects. It looks great and gameplay is fun and incredibly complex. The heroes are diverse and interesting and there is always something to improve or learn. It's ridiculous such a polished game is free (of pay to win mechanics). Unfortunately the game also requires an insane amount of your time and the learning curve is very steep. This kind of game attracts a special kind of player. And unfortunately you have to play with these hate-filled, unhappy and forever ignorant people. If you are looking to have fun, then Dota is the wrong game. Unless you play with 4 real life friends. But people who play DOTA 2 don't have real life friends.. so.. yeah. Welcome to dopamine driven misery."

I can only tell by 29.09.2022 this game is pile of horse extrements, its so unbalanced at so many level that playing this game doesnt make sense at all. If u are young person just stop playing it u will only waste time, each update they break smt (i guess on purpose) so they can milk money from the game in a manner of ""we are doing changes (insert brainlet meme here )"". Dont waste your time on it, at this point your skillz doesnt really matter in lets say even game, if u pick op hero u will win without even trying. Ofc im not ""pro"" but pls watch replays :) either there are no ""op"" heroes in games or both side had them or game doesnt make sense.

Have a great game! Too bad because your mid-lane is throwing. Made a small mistake? Everyone hates you. Very rarely is there a match where nothing goes wrong between team members. It can be quite enjoyable when you encounter a game without people issues, although this is rare.

The most fun I have had with this game was when I simply decided to mute everybody. This was not ideal, though, because now you cannot communicate, which is necessary for a competitive team game."

Ive stopped about 6 months and what i hate about this game is that i am not a leaver but we have brownouts here and its painstaking to be punished for 3 random drafts for that. On the good side though online games had a toll on my anger issues and im better now. Past updates would refresh that ban and i would just comeback. Recent updates are so strict they wouldn't refresh the ban. I will play soon if they revert back to that refresh thing. See ya guys around"

2860,"Dota 2, more like Warcraft III. 99.9% of my play time is in the Arcade mode. Be sure to check it out!"
2861,"See you in hell, Haribo Sugar-Free Gummi Bears

It was my last class of the semester, and the final exam was worth 30% of our grade.
After a late night study session I felt confident, but I had to decide between sleeping in or cooking breakfast. My eyelids chose sleep.
My stomach later regretted this decision, and after several uncomfortable stomach growls, I finally decided to make a quick stop by the campus bookstore and grab a snack before my test. Since the semester was ending and everyone was going home for the summer, a lot of items were on sale, including the snacks and candy that they kept up front. Being in the hungry state that I was in, it felt only logical to pick the largest, yet least expensive candy in order to get more bang for my buck.
And there they sat: two bags of Haribo Sugar-Free Gummi Bears, buy one get one free.
""What a deal!"" I thought na√Øvely. I would eat one bag before my test, and one bag afterwards.
As I walked to class, I gleefully chewed on those abominable little bastards, unaware of the utter mayhem that they would soon unleash upon my poor, poor anus.
I sat down at my desk as the professor informed us that, due to issues with cheating in the past, restroom breaks would be prohibited until the completion of the exam.
""I'll give you 10 minutes to use the restroom now; this will be your last chance. Any takers?""
The demon bears hadn't released their unholy necromancy upon my stomach yet, so in my moment of ignorant foolishness, I remained seated, still munching on those miniature bear-shaped bombs.
After the students wise enough to take the professor's offer had returned, the professor handed out the test. I was six questions in when it happened.
It started subtly at first, almost like a slight tingly sensation in my lower abdomen. I thought nothing of it, assuming my intestines were just doing their thang. Little did I know that my intestines were trying desperately to warn me of the horror that was on the horizon.
By question 9 it happened again, but this time it was followed by a sharp pain, as if those infernal hellions had orchestrated an attack upon my colon. I fought to contain the groan that tried escaping my lips. It was at this point I began to panic; something was going horribly long, and I needed to get through this test before it got any worse.
By question 14 my worst fear was upon me; the Satan bears' burning, hot, liquidy dark magic crashed against my anal sphincter like a tidal wave. I was able to close the hatch just in time, but those relentless, toxic bears beat against it like Orcs breaking down the doors of Helm's Deep. I knew I wouldn't be able to so much as shift in my seat without risking a breach.
I kept fighting through my exam, clenching my cheeks with all my might. Beads of sweat began rolling down my neck. Suddenly, a loud, gurgling war cry came from my belly, and the entire class lifted their heads.
At this point, nothing mattered except expelling this ungodly presence from my bowels. With 15 questions left, I promptly wrote C for every answer and ran out of the classroom. My professor yelled something, but I was too preoccupied with the volcanic eruption that needed to take place before I could find sweet, sweet relief.
I burst into the restroom like the Kool-Aid man and, behold, the handicap stall was empty. Sun rays from the adjacent window shone upon it, as if it were a gift from God himself. It took me less than .5 seconds to undo my belt buckle, pull down my pants, and finally relax my weary buttocks upon the toilet seat.
It took absolutely no effort to expel this demon. Almost immediately, the floodgates of hell were opened and the damned, liquified souls of an entire bag's worth of gummi bears cried as they burned through my sphincter and into the watery abyss below. I had never felt such simultaneous relief and anguish in my life.
After 30 more minutes of this, I immediately went home, dug a hole in my backyard, and burned the remaining bag of gummi bears.
I leave with this; do not, I repeat do NOT eat these spawns of Satan. Not only did they cause me to fail my final test, but the anguish I experienced is something I wouldn't wish upon anyone, not even my worst enemy.

2895,"valves very greedy, the games toxic AF, they are so many small things valve can easily add such as a concede button. Or maybe dont make people pay money to be able to avoid/block other players (wish I was joking). 

But I still play because this was my first MOBA and it will be my last. Just Valve needs to step it up."

2904,"This game is a lot of fun, and it's always getting updated. I like that they're doing weekend events, too. A lot of those are fun and surprising, but I wish they would keep some of them as consistent game modes. The player base, though, can get toxic real fast, so I tend to ignore them, which is what I recommend for anyone reading this as you won't get better by listening to dudes calling you trash. It's hard to get good at this game, and that's what makes it fun. It takes a lot of experimentation, failure, and grit to get good at this, and it's rewarding when you get that win due to your efforts. Oh, this game is free, too, so why not get it already and play some games?"

2918,"I've been playing a bit with a friend. It's a really fun game in my oppion but after about 200 hours I still feel like a complete noob. I don't really have a firm grasp on the characters and what they each do but I have enough that I can contribute to the team. If you're into a game where it has a lot to learn and understand then that's a plus. The biggest downside is that there are a ton of toxic community members. So if you're going to play, start playing with a friend who isn't toxic."
2919,At first it was fun but their match making system is trash. Hope yourot in hell for torturing me :)
2920,"Valve killed techies.
Fire up! Fire up!! Fire up!!!"
2921,"Great game, I always picture it as modern chess where you only get to control one piece. You have to formulate strategies with your team to work out the best ways to proceed, when your heroes will peak in terms of strength and then in turn when you will push or when you should defend/avoid fights. 

The only downside is people paying high ranking players to increase their MMR and a somewhat generally toxic community. Although you do get some nice, pleasant players sometimes, just generally it's quite toxic. 

In terms of adrenaline rush team fights, heart thumping shocks when someone daggers in to initiate on you and careful strategy planning, it's pretty hard to beat though which keeps me coming back. 

I periodically uninstall this game to stop myself becoming too addicted, pretty sure it contributed towards me not attending or finishing my 1st degree too, you have been warned!!"

There‚Äôs a huge time investment before you can even enjoy a game, let alone feel competent at it. But once you start to learn its secrets, there‚Äôs a wild and exciting variety of play here that‚Äôs unmatched, even by its peers. It‚Äôs a challenge of knowledge as well as reflexes, and success is a rush. The fact that it‚Äôs completely and totally free to play in the way we wish all free-to-play games could be isn‚Äôt just one of the most generous propositions anywhere in gaming, it creates a level playing field where skill and cooperation is paramount. May the best team win."

The game combines strategy, teamwork, reflexes and experience in an unprecedented way, which is why you can make a lot of money playing it. This is a game with depth and complexity in a different dimension compared with any other game that ever existed. If you would like a game that would constantly in every second put your to the test in 100 ways you know of and 10000 ways you don't know of, while learning and becoming better at it, I would strongly recommend DotA

3103,"This game ruined my life
I recommend everyone to play Dota 2 and not LoL nor Mobile Legends
Don't get me wrong, I am not hating or anything. I was from Dota 1 for like 3-4 years before Dota 2 was released and it didn't caught my attention to adapt the new theme of it.

Dota 2 is a great game, an awesome game. I really should have thought about spending money on a free game but to hell with it I say. Mechanics are well designed, what makes a hero OP is the player behind it and the team that surrounds it. This is a team game people, so team work is a must (unless you are solo queuing, then you have to carry your garbage of a team but it can be the other way around). Monster gamers are real.

Dota 2 has taught me a lot of things, you can only be good at something if you focus on it, learn from mistakes, be aware of your surroundings, trust your instinct, use common sense, trusting on your team to always have your back, believing in your capabilities, always try to be better than you were yesterday, and that..

THE COMEBACKS ARE REAL!!!
This game bought me and my friends together for lan parties and strengthen our bonds. A mere game that brings people together, not just friends but complete strangers too. Dota 2 is a game that will never be forgotten.

All in all, I recommend this game to everyone who wants to experience pain, suffering, and torment because at the end, you will come to a sudden realization that things are always bound to get better.

P.S. Calm down, it's just a game...... YAWA!"

3166,"Dota 2 is a great game. It is well made, with very deep and complex mechanics and tons of interesting scenarios that can arise. That being said, the game's main downfall is being a very very competitive 5v5 pvp game. This leads to a player base that does not tolerate inexperienced or unskilled players. In a team game, this pretty much ruins it because of abundant toxicity. If you can turn off chat and enjoy the game, great. But I wouldn't suggest anyone get into this game if they aren't already into it. It is better than League though."

But no game has made me feel so consistently rewarded for my time, and as consistently, wonderfully connected to the friends I play it with. I always find myself coming back to this game. So by that I highly recommend Dota 2."

Everyone is quick to talk about how much more toxic the LOL community is and that may be true, but being ""not as bad"" doesn't fix things.  So, is the game good, yes, is the community challenging... 100%.  Whether it's ranked or casual you'll find your teammates quitting in the first 5 minutes for simply asking them to place a ward.

3332,well nothing there is to say about this game. Its just the best game ever made till date. Period.
3333,"This game is SO good and i do not mean that ironically. Little details the develepors added to the game, the graphics, fun you could have with your homeboys from DOTA 2, how interesting and satisfying to see how much you improved on a 1 hard hero and the entire existence of arcade mode is astonishing. Why i do not recommend this game? Because it is 5% beginner friendly in public servers, if you play for 100 hours and learn nothing because of angry russians and filipinos. There is a higher chance of you getting the rank herald rather than every else ranks because you learned nothing for 100 hours in unranked match and played the shittiest 10 rank calibiration matches. And you will be stuck in the rank herald for a long time untill you realize you can get out of herald by carrying your team with an initiator carry. It will take very long to realize this but even if you play initiator carry very good, your bad teammates in herald will ruin the match. There is a suggestion for players under 50 hours in DOTA 2, make a test account where you will learn DOTA 2, and dont spend money on that account(more like an alt account). Then hop on your new account and get a greater rank whenever you feel like ready for the DOTA 2 ranked matchmaking."

3526,"Dude I'll be real, this game sucks and will consume hours of your life for no reason. Will I still play it? Yeah sure I guess I hate myself enough for that. 

The salt is real, 
the racism is real,
the swearing is real, 
the loathing and hatred is real, 
the OP heroes are real, 
getting ironically tipped after someone kills you is real, 
having team mates who don't understand tactics or strategy and just run in and die multiple times is real,
having team mates rage at you for using strategy and tactics they don't understand is real,
enemies and team mates flaming you for split pushing is real, 
enemies flaming you for not taking all of their racks before ending is real, 
your team mates not ending when they can is real, 
heaven forbid you solo queue and end up in a four stack because as sure as they're stupid they will blame you for losing.

Then Gaben said, 'Let there be DOTA!'"
3608,"Don't waste your life , the game is like a black hole it absorbs every light left in your life."
3609,"a lot can be improved. but over all else im surprised there is a virus that keeps disconnecting my system and disabling my wifi, i did not think dota 2 would have gone that far to mess with someone, its all been verified. happens only with dota 2 no other game... imagine installing virus through steam on selected people...

anyway about the game.
but it straight out toxic environment.
especially sea server and i don't think other regions are any better.
i mean if you want to be a toxic player that's fine but there is no line that differentiates that. its all mixed up.
for example the reporting system, the smurfs, these are common problems that have existed from day 1. 
alot can be done to improve these conditions but maybe its not profitable to dota 2.
i mean people openly boost accounts buy and sell them.
half the people dont even know how to mute forget reporting.
what if you want a very fine gaming experience?? you wont get that here even though you may love the game."

But what keeps DOTA on the top is it's the first MOBA, and therefore, it defines what a MOBA should be. And yes, people are going to call you trash. And yes, you will have a hard time getting to the secret shop when your team is down 10k gold. But when you get fed on Mortred and oneshot three people with a crit, it will all be worth it. Mostly."

3899,"Imagine creating an actually fun game, but then for some misterious reason, the people in charge decide to set the camera capture so close (1134 Distance) that you can`t even see what your own hero is doing most of the time.  Since many heroes have long range spells, or a spreat out battle (gank) happens 50% of your concentration goes into managing your camera position; which simply could be  taken out by default by the people in charge.... 

You think this is all ? nope try starting a conversation about this topic in reddit, and see the topic closed by moderators beacause it seems to be sensible topic... (lets see how long this review will stay up...).  And this is my main point, i could somehow life with the rest of the following points. 
But to have the camera capture so close in a strategic teamplaying game with so many heroes with long range spells simply blows my mind and destroyes this game for me.  
(until July2022 there was always a  way around this by enlarging the view via dll.file) which was (rightly) considered a cheat.  for me i didn`t care using it since i knew i would not play dota to earn money with it.  Since July this loophole is now closed. But it was open for as long as Dota2 was up.... so just imgaine the devs now getting so tensed about this topic that you can`t even talk about it ???   why not enlarging the camera view for all the same, even top tier player would love the change !!!

i dont get it: but i get some more points why i would never recommend starting playing dota again: 
- AFK Players:  for some misterious reason some people can stay afk, buy buying an item called shadow amulett, some even wihthout , as i just witnessed. By default if your hero doesn`t move, and gains no experience points for 5 minutes you get an abbandon. this rule always applied to me, but as mentioned some people seem to have  a way around this wich leads me to the next point. 

-Useless Report System: by default you get 5 reports you can send during the game. imagine playing a ranked game, suddenly for whatever reason a player decides to deliberately go afk or hurting your team otherwise by feeding , handing over wards and neutral items to the enemy etc... all you can do is send in a report. you can even send in all 5 if you want. the player (maybe) will get punished if this report by chance will get checked by another player set in as judge for this particular situation. which will happen in very very few cases. Since the availability of judges in contrast to reports is maybe in the average of 1:1000.  but to make you feel better, once in a while you will get a notification saying something like: your report was checked, and the player punished.  (which means, at best he willl get to play 3 low priority games)...

Cheats: as mentioned there seems to be some loophoels in staying afk, at least i withnessed 20 peoples so far not getting an abbandon after not moving an inch (nor gaining xp) over a period of 5 minutes. but there are other cheats, like the ""fear"" cheat of Shadow Fiend, to mention only one, there are more like no cooldowns on ultimate abilities. And this also is still possible, while for players like me who litterally get nausea playing the game at this close capture view, are beeing punished by not allowing larger camerea option.

-Avoiding player list:  is NOT available if you don`t pay monthly for Dota Plus.... so this means, even if you send in your report for missbehaviour you will end up having the exact same player with his toxic behaviour a few games later and there is NOTHING you can do. if you pay for dota you will get a list of 20 Players (which you can enlarge for credits ((but those expansions get super expensive later))), which you will fill faster than you can extend it. believe me, beeing a player that joins games to win, not tox around, i can speak with quite some experience, you will fill those 20 spots in no time... 

-Matchmaking: beeing a player that joins games to win them and doing all it takes (often more  than the average player, by warding, healing ohter etc.. even as carry) you get a very positive winrate quite fast. The matchmaking algorythm doesn`t like this at all, and you will get punished for it by getting games with toxic fast abbandoning players. and also here there is no way to go arround which leads you to the points i mentioned above. since you can`t to anything as non-paying player, and very little as paying player. therefore even considering dota plus is totally useless. as experienced player the only reason why i would pay for dota would be the ""avoid player-list"" (but as mentioned , this list is very limited and you will fill it in less than 40 games, 100% guaranteed).

The game is actually very well done. you can choose between a lot of heroes, which creates interesting games. but for mentioned reason. Beeing the super close camera view. and it`s highly addictive nature. 

i would not reccomend even starting playing dota"

3921,"If you are interested in strategic games, Dota 2 game can also be interesting for you; But you should pay attention to these three points:
1. You should definitely go through the training section before playing online and then try to start playing with easy heroes like Axe, Jug, etc. and then go to high level heroes.
2. Be sure to play the part of the game against the robot a lot, because your easiest game in the online game is more difficult than your hardest game against the robot.
3. In the beginning, try to focus on one hero and avoid playing with different heroes.
The above tips were very effective for me, at the end, consider these tips: it is very important to see the game of professional players, read the information of each hero, read the information of the game items, try to find some friends and play the game for Enjoy the game, it will help you not to get bored in the beginning and it will help you to enjoy the game more in the future."

I've been playing DotA as a WC3 mod in the past (since ver 5.84c), moved on to a worthy successor in Heroes of Newerth which in the beginning was actually better than Dota 2 but over time it eventually came out on top and is now pretty much THE game to play in the genre."

3985,"Dota 2 is still one of the most popular games around, and for good reason! The gameplay is incredibly deep and rewarding, and the community is still as passionate as ever. However, there are a few things that could be improved. For one, the matchmaking system could be a lot better. It's often very difficult to find matches that are fair, and as a result, a lot of players get frustrated and quit the game. The other issue is the lack of new content. Sure, there are the occasional new heroes or items, but for the most part, the game feels like it's been in a bit of a stagnation. Hopefully, the developers will add some more fresh and exciting content in the future to keep players engaged.All in all, though, Dota 2 is still a great game and well worth your time. just be prepared to put in a lot of hours to really learn all it has to offer."
3986,Good

The basics are always there because its a tower defense game at its core with heroes who battle to push these lanes to bring disruption to the equilibrium of the lane with over 100 heroes. You have to make the effort to learn basics and learn your heroes through battle and learn from others. hopefully we grow the community into more battles to discuss what works because it will change. icefrog has done good in evolving a mod that i been playing so. here's to another 3,055 hours."

4207,"REALLY GOOD GAME RUINED BY REALLY BAD SMURFS. This game is really fun but its being destroyed by smurfs. New players generally start out in the herald-crusader bracket where you would expect these ""new players"" to enjoy a game against others who play in the same lower levels. The problem is sadly a lot of smurfs find satisfaction in destroying noobs and create or buy accounts to play in herald brackets which is really frustrating. This game used to be fun but not anymore. I have had 6 out 10 games played with smurfs on the enemy team. So many account who are level 24 and have multiple rampages in a single day displayed on theyre profile but they are still ""herald 3"". this issue has been going on since forever and valve talks alot but does nothing to stop it. I guess thats why dota is dying. More older players are leaving the game than new players are joining. And why would they join? To be stomped on by some smurf who u wants to have a laugh at you while they destroy you? NO THANK YOU"

Rule 3 : DOTA doesnt believe in balance between heroes. Judge you team heroes well and try to help those are actually powerfull heroes. So they can win the game for you.
Rule 4 : Support means alot more than a hero with a disable skill. You got to dedicate to it.
Rule 5 : Cyka blyat.

4393,"This game is amazing to learn and can keep you hooked for years. I'd stay away from ranked though, if you want to enjoy competitive gameplay just watch the pro scene. It's too toxic and far too addicting, this is coming from a former top 2000 NA. Enjoy unranked, enjoy the vast library of custom games, and enjoy the community on youtube and twitch. Don't take it too seriously and be prepared to mute the huge population of racists and toxic players."

4402,"While I love this game for the game itself. Others treat the game as a job, and rightfully so, with the amount of time and energy you need to put into learning the game. It can create extremely toxic environments(even I've been a part of doing this) and lowers quality of matches. 

I don't recommend picking it up unless you have the time and energy to truly learn the Meta, Mechanics, Macro-Game, and Micro-Game. Itemization, drafting and team dynamics are stupid important to keep in mind as well, and if you're hardstuck on winning MMR, losses and tilt will make you forget this and the above paragraph happens. You blame your teammates and instaqueue and repeat. 

I'll still play the game myself, as I've put in the time, I understand where I peak and don't care too much for the mmr anymore, and can love the game as it is, but I can't with good conscience recommend Dota to a new player. You should take the time to think yourself on if you have enough time to stress over learning something so diverse, or if you'd rather download the game for the custom games, or just play Bioshock."

Genuinely the best MOBA, deep depth of builds, plenty of heroes without constantly pumping out new ones. Deeply consistent, heroes don't constantly get re-done. 
Literally less toxic than any other MOBA, but that might be because I don't speak russian.

4483,By far one of the most toxic moba communities I have ever been apart of. The lack of new player experinces to help make the game seem at all fun or engaging are non existent. not to mention the fact that i cant even play a game with someone who can speak english even though im playing and qing for us ec servers. Is it that hard to allow new player to play enjoy a game? Not only is Dota a toxic cespool of the most racist europeans on the planet it also has the most dated and overly intricate item system ive ever seen in a moba. The best part is valve hides what the best items and leveling paths are behind a fucking paywall. that alone is a red flag that this game is fucking trash. When the company who makes the game hides all the most useful information behind a fucking pay wall. 138 hours wasted on a old fucking relic of a game filled with racist homophobic europeans raging over players who cant help be bad due to Dota's lack of care for new players. Id rather waste my time playing the shit show that is league then bother opening this game again. At least League has better fucking art style and a cohesive shop.
4484,new players getting thrown into games with 10k+ hour players
4485,"A big classic. There is a reason it is this popular. It is the most played game on my collection, even though I dont like staying on one game for long. Pros: Extremely deep, with mechanics that may take years to grasp/master, super crispy tech-wise, very few problems. Cons: A big investment, a terrible community that requires intense multiplayer communication filtering, and takes on average 40 mins a round. 

PS: Ability Draft is the most innovative idea on its market, and it is a widely supported mod by the devs."

4524,"10/10 love this game, free to play and addictive, laugh, love, win, lose and cry all in a single game, don't like LOL (League of Legends) good this is the one you want to play instead. Want a game you can come home from school, work, walking the dog  , play and waste several hours of the night before you go to bed? lose your girlfriend? the house? the car? this game is for you.

Pros:
- Beat people up a wide array of spells and items
- fun game to play with friends
- different classes to suit different play styles, mix and match to your own style
- watch games to learn tips and get coaching
- over 80 characters to chose from
- good learning curve, you'll pick it up quickly and keep learning and experimenting the more you play.

Cons:
- sweaty try hards that will jump on the fact your a noob ( don't get discouraged )
- bots ( well people acting like a macro script doing nothing or feeding ) think this is a valve anti cheat thing but there's is an option to report and they do take action.
- mmr could do with a tweak in unranked, teams can be massively one sided, beginners could do with the first 10 matches playing against each other with a guardian from the community to watch over the match so this doesn't get exploited.

Rating 10/10 addictive, fun, and downright stupid at times :) have fun and welcome to Dota 2

4565,"The only other game I've had such a problem abandoning is Starcraft, and I suspect that this is just filling the void that Starcraft left.  Also, it's easier for an old to only manage one character at a time.  

This game is a little like Eve, in that the only winning play is to quit.  Don't play it."
4566,Good
4567,I really like this game. Its like LoL but more challenging and demanding. The learning curve is difficult but rewarding.
4568,gud
4569,"Love the game, but hate the community (sometimes)"
4570,"Do not play this game, there is not a more absolutely annoying player base than those who play this game. New players will be treated like garbage, and so will returning players. Every single game I have played since returning has been consistently toxic for not playing how other players want you to. The game is not fun because of the players, they will belittle you, yell at you and straight up quit the game the second they find out you are new or returning. Honestly, the game might be fun for people who have established themselves as players, but do not try to play this game if you are new or have been away for a long time."
4571,"It pretty much went super hardcore, I like this game but I can't even play Meepo in unranked, need to play like 20 times with other characters I don't even know how to play with (at least in league of legends you only need to buy a champion/hero to play it) this just became another lootbox-athon like Counter Strike with similar grind skill to League of Legends, because most people were playing for longer ammounts of time and it became harder to enjoy this casualy. If you want to play it, you can, it has a solid gameplay etc. just like I play CS:GO, I enjoy the core gameplay but casual can become a nightmare since you need to be at the top of your game (and I don't have time for playing CS and DoTA at the same time).
I know I'm kinda rusty but seriously locking rooster is dumb (at least in casual).

EDIT: I've finally unlocked Meepo, life's good"
4572,"Okay, if I... if I chop you up in a meat grinder, and the only thing that comes out, that's left of you, is your eyeball, you'r- you're PROBABLY DEAD! You're probably going to - not you, I'm just sayin', like, if you- if somebody were to, like, push you into a meat grinder, and, like, your- one of your finger bones is still intact, they're not gonna pick it up and go, ""Well see, yeah it wasn't deadly, it wasn't an instant kill move! You still got, like, this part of your finger left!"" NO I'M NOT GONNA PUT YOU INTO A MEAT GRINDER. I'M NOT GONNA PUT YOU INTO A MEAT GRINDER. NO. I'm making a reference to the fact that, like, if I, like, if I were to get fucking KILLED... I don't know, YOU KNOW WHAT I'M SAYIN'. If- if- okay, if you were to- okay we're gonna take humans out of this, if alien Globgobglobgo 1 fuckin' shoots a disintegrating ray at alien Globglo 2, if there's only fucking TEETH LEFT, it's- it's fucking you're dead, you're dead."

Do yourself, your friends, your family, and the universe a favor, and don't even bother installing this game.

Find out about roles, positions, when to pick, what to pick etc - or deal with losing a bit more with figuring it out as you go). Subscribe to dota-plus if you want some cool recommendations to help with hero and item choices. The new-player-mode makes it easy enough to practice new heros (which you definitely should be doing). Expect to see some toxic players, just learn where the mute button is early on, keep your cool and you'll have a blast. Much more fun when playing with friends!"

4766,"didn't bother to write a review on dota 2 before, but after my last game, felt that it needed to be done. Does it offer a lot of fun, team tactics, sense of acomplishment? yes!
does it happen? No.

In my last game, a piece of trash player, the most toxic rat in my last 500 matches at least, as support silencer, just fucked around for 20 minutes, doing anything possible to fuck the team. Reporting him for griefing or whatever does absolutely nothing. As a multi million dollar game, this is the ""fun"" this utter garbage game offers.
Waste of time and mental health with toxic players that happen to be almost in every match, in one team or another. 
Instead of giving the possibility  to end a trash match, you either waste more time, or abandon, meaning you get punished instead  of the toxic player that ruined it.
WP Valve.  May your personal lives and families be ""blessed"" with the same kind of people."

4781,"Game is fun overall especially if you play with some of your friends.
But the thing is if you want to go up in MMR first of all you have to calibrate to get you rank and get started and most of the times you will get a lower rank than you deserve and you will have to climb your way up.
But that's not it, the problem is when you play extremely well with people with the same rank that you got (which should've been higher) and start winning many games the system will match you with smurfs (because they think you are smurfing while you are just trying to get to the rank that you deserve) and you will lose so much games and then the season ends and you will have the option to re-calibrate your rank and the same thing happens over and over again.
Again, game is fun ,I  personally enjoy it very much and have so many hours but the matchmaking system really needs fixing."

5669,"The best PC game I have ever played and it was free!?  MOBA games are confusing if you haven't ever played one so give it some time.
I play with friends vs AI Bots to make it less toxic. There are bot packs in this game that are unmatched in anything I have ever played elsewhere."
5670,I think it is a nice game but it could be improved.
5671,good stuff
5672,zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz
5673,"I played the game for quite a few years and I really enjoyed it very much. Until the point where I started noticing that the quality of games gradually went down, with most games nowadays being absolutely uneven, with either team stomping the other, probably due to how the matchmaking algorithm actually works. This further feeds toxicity, which makes you enjoy the game even less, up to a point, where you feel less like you are playing a game and more like you are scrolling through twitter, game by game, either riding the high from a winning streak, or trying to get at least that one win in a day.
I uninstalled and reinstalled the game many times in past two years, with less and less frequency, up to a point where I just stopped and I realized I'm pretty much happier playing other games and the nostalgia isn't worth the hassle.
TL:DR If you intend to play solo and have a good time at the same time, you are quite a few years late to play this game."

5832,"Pros : Friends <3
Cons : 
- Shittiest Developers in world.
- Billion dollor company with 0 line code for matchmaking. lvl1 can play lvl200. im not joking. 0 line code to make game balanced.
- 10,000 behavior score and still everyone are toxic and if you win enemy team will abandon. which means ape developers didnt wrote any code there too or their IQ couldnt handle it.
- They have only 1 algorithm and its 50%-50% forced winrate. which means 50% of games you are in better team (+50lvl, experienced players) and you are farming them which isnt fun killing some newplayer. and the other 50% of games you are in a team with 4 or 3 new player against 5 experienced players just to make that 50-50 happen, its forced and inevitable. 
- In Unranked its just a nightmare for new players to play for first time among 8,9 experienced people. its same for experienced people. its a nightmare to have a lvl1 Mid against a high level player. give us some balance. with hrs, match number, level, ....

I will still play it. because im playing it since warcraft 3 and dota 1. but it hurts to see that my favorite game is ruined by a useless billion dollor company."

5846,"I am a 45 yo father, probably one of the oldest people playing this game. I am a single farther to my Son, who is 14 now. My son got this game for Christmas in 2021 from his uncle, so we installed it on his computer and he started playing. By the end of the week he had 24 hours on this game. This was horrible for me, as it was already hard for me to find ways to spend time with my son, as he is always out with his friends or just watching YouTube. So I decided to make a Steam account and get this game to see if I could maybe play alongside him. I loaded into the game, picked my character and started playing but I was stuck on what you where supposed to do. I asked my Son for help and he hosted a game for me to join. I loved it as it was the best time I had spent with my Son since my wife had died. This game has ever since brought me and my son closer again and now we actually spend time together outside the house together as well. This game reminded me that there's fun to be had in everything, and it has brought both me and my Son many happy memories."

5875,"3k hours here. Here is what I learned: 
* Dota is great but it's a bitch to learn. 
* Toxicity in lower MMR kills all the fun. 
* Play with friends that are at your skill level. 
* Better mute all than play along the toxic game. 
* Positive reinforcement goes a long way. 
* If you think you are the best in the game you will become toxic.
* There are better ways to spend your time."

Now I can't access STEAM without VPN, but event can access steam now with VPN but I can't play DOTA 2 in game because I can't chose region, my ping on all region is failed and unknown.

Well but no problem with other offline game and any update available with using VPN. Will be missed this game so much, I hope this regulation in my country get take off soon."

6096,"Great game, but smurfs and boosters ruined it to unplayable state. I've installed it again after long break, during calibration I saw smurf on enemy team in almost every game, while only once on our team, so of course we kept losing and I was calibrated to Herald III. Then same continued - on average there were more smurfs on enemy team than on ours so MMR just kept dropping despite me playing well, it's just odds of having teammates that are worse than enemy teams for some reason. Maybe it's because I kept getting matched against PARTIES, something should not happen ever because parties play so much more coordinated and have no feeders or clueless people in them, while those who queue alone can have anything in their teams, all of this leading to more losses than wins on average so MMR dropping, so I dropped to Herald I and I still see smurfs on enemy teams, playing difficult heroes perfectly and doing 30-5 or something per match and getting to 30 level while our team is at 15-20. There's just zero chance of winning.
Oh, and chat is 24/7 spammed with 'boost MMR' advertisements.
Today I had enough and I uninstalled it, bye dota and fu valve for ignoring smurf problem and destroying your own game."

first of all, DOTA2 has had many super professional events.

thanks in advanced

This game has won the hearts of millions of players. Once a common map to the great Warcraft 3, it has grown into its own label, adored by millions of players around the world. Meet: Dota 2 by Valve Co.
If you have played the map Warcraft, then you do not need much explanation, but if you are in doubts: to pump or not, here's what it looks like - ten people spend some time killing the enemy minions or neutral (creeps) or characters (heroes). With the proceeds you buy artifacts that give you certain attributes (stats) and skills (skills). With the experience you gain, if you level up, you learn the skills (skills) of the character. The main task of your team is to destroy the enemy's main building (enchantment), on the way to which you have to destroy combat towers from level one to four (the difference in power, armor and number of hit points as the level increases)."

6500,"The Dota 2 Report System doesn't work.
You can get actionably reported for any reason whatsoever.

If you are paired in successive games with 4 petty and spiteful people they can easily report you and get you soft banned. This can easily snowball into more bans and lowering your behavior score which can remove you from the matchmaking pool.
Valve cannot grow the Dota 2 population because of this, and they are a company with bad worth ethic as so many former employees have come forward and stated.

Avoid this game, it's very stagnant and Valve refuse to fix the reporting system. After many years it is clear."

back then in 2009 , i start Dota pacth 4,3 , these day i trying hard to remembered every item in this game, after so many years then i decide to comeback in 2022 , so many item added and more heroes."
6659,"Probably the hardest game in the world overall. You will be terrible for months, maybe years. Then you'll only be OK and still struggle. This is not a casual game - you either commit to the suck, or you shouldn't even bother starting."

6674,"Best game ever, if you are willing to lose for 500 hours and sell your soul to Gaben. After that you can get occasional triumphs and wins but you are still useless piece of garbage. In the end, after 1000 hours, you get little better, but you still suck major cojones. You should start this game before you are 30 years old. Love it."

6755,"Please remove this bug or exploit or hack I don't even know what it is.
Basically I queued a ranked game today after having a bad day.
When loading the draft screen my mouse disappeared totally. I thought my game bugged out so I tried to relaunch it twice but both time the mouse would disappear every time when the heroes screen would load.
So I wasn't able to select a hero until eventually I lost all of my gold (and everyone lost the max amount of time) and was randomly attributed a hero.
But then I also got assessed an abandon. So the game was made safe to leave and everyone one left and everyone lost their precious time due to some stupid bug or hack or something.
Unfortunately I couldn't restart my computer to see if that could have maybe fixed it because I can't restart it fast enough to not be assessed with an abandon. So we won't ever know.
But I really don't think it was an issue or anything with me at all.
Also when I left the game lobby or more exactly got kicked out (since I couldn't do anything since I had no mouse) then I soon as I got out of the lobby then my mouse cursor came back. Also my cursor was always still there in other applications. In only disappeared in the drafting lobby. I could even see it fade in and out of existence when I alt-tabbed.
Also it's not the cursor was just hidden. I tried clicking on anything because I didn't want to be punished with an abandon. But it was like the mouse was totally missing.
So now I'm being punished for bugs in the game and whatnot and I'm banned for 30 minutes.
I don't even know if I want to play this game anymore. Like I said I've had like the worst day today in a very long time and now the only escape I got to this f'ed life is some game that decides to just punish me even more.
So I can't even escape my horrible reality anymore in one of the few games I even like rn.
So are you trying to let people kill themselves with this kind of behaviors or what?
Please fix this bug. I will change this review to ""I recommend this game"" if I have some proof it is fixed. Because I do really like this game but this kind of bugs can drive people insane. And it's not ok to punish people for things they are not even responsible off.
Overall I really love DotA2 but right now it's making me want to kill myself so I can't say I would recommend it to anyone anymore.
So one last time, please fix this. It's probably not all that complicated of a bug. Or please at least try."

Only redeeming quality about this game is arcade and special events where 2/3 people are still toxic. Otherwise it is the biggest waste of time you could get involved with, its a chore where the other people doing the chore with you are actively trying to stop you from completing the chore. Go play heroes of the storm."

6774,"WARNING to players:

This game has a forced win loss algorithm to keep players addicted, have less people leave, lower queue times in the lower ranks and of course money. Everyone I know who plays has many wins in a row, followed by many losses in a row over and over in an obvious pattern. Do not believe valves lies. There are also a lot of smurfs and boosters. The only way to rank up is to grind out a very long time playing unranked during loss pool, and ranked during win pool. They say the bottom ranks are like less then 5% of their player base but that is an outright lie. A large portion of long time players are stuck there no matter how competent they are. Anyone who denies this is just ignorant. All online competitive games have this. League of Legends devs  and Valorant admit it exists and they even have a name for it. 

This is outright fraud and these companies should be sued for these deceitful practices. The modern gaming industry is nothing but shady these days. Money and greed ruins everything.

Also games average like 40 mins to well over an hour now which is just too much time for 1 game. 

Players are very toxic and very few use a mic or communicate whatsoever and the ones that do are usually lame. 

Just avoid this game and watch it die. These games sound fun in theory and if your casual maybe but if you want to rank up, it isn't one bit fair."

If you can't create a whole 5 man team, you will enjoy all the great things like blaming, flaming, shouting insults (usually in russian), hearing insults of your mom, of your dog, of your dog mom and your mom and your dog in a bed. You will hear how bad you are, no matter what you do or how good what you do actually is. You will lose many games just because someone stops playing and gives up, usually in combination of all the things said before. You will hate it and you will want to quit. And you will come back. Because the game itself is really, really good."

there is a tip in-game that says ""Dota is best enjoyed with friends"", if we were to neglect the agony that is the game I would agree with that statement, but make sure that you are playing with friends that you are willing to lose.
This game is like cocaine, you try it, you get hooked, you hate it, but you always come back to get that short duration high while it's happening, and after it ends, depressed you come back to it to forget your pain of not having it. not that i tried cocain"

6933,if you want to press bad controls
6934,I played Heroes of Newerth before this game and honestly it does not compare. I was disappointed. It is just not the same at all.
6935,G!
6936,"Good game as long as you aren't facing smurf accounts, and trust me, there are a lot of smurf accounts. The matchmaking also sucks, as I was pitted against someone with over 3k games on my 3rd ever match, but the game itself is fun, especially if you can play with friends and suffer long enough to learn some mechanics. Big bug at the moment though is that the entire system of guides in matches which help you choose items and level ups doesn't work, at all. You also get some fun and friendly messages on how to uninstall and kill yourself, overall lovely community.
Highly recommend the game 10/10."

6989,"I played this game a lot since its beggining. I have over 30k hours playing it because for me its the perfect game. Sadly valve is a terrible company that is ruining the game for profit. Game is very poorly optimized, the matchmaking system is a mess. And the report system is absolutely broken. If you have connectivity issues every 15-20 games be prepared for getting a low behaviour score and being muted although it has nothing to do with behaviour and has everything to do with poor optimization of the game. Meanwhile griefers happily play day in day out and you have the same players constantly ruining other peoples games and instead of getting permanently banned they dont get punished as much as someone with a poor connection.

So thank you valve for being such a terrible company and ruining one of the best games ever by pandering to profits and making DotA more and more like LoL."

7025,"Alright, since I'm close to hitting 1k hours I guess I'll finally drop my review in the bucket.

In the League vs DotA debate I have always considered myself a League of Legends player. Not because I think it's better necessarily, but because I just started playing it at the very start and saw no reason to learn something else since I was already entrenched and none of my friends played DotA and didn't want to learn. Despite this, DotA's reputation as League's deeper and more mature counterpart continued to make me curious and after reading reddit and watching some youtube videos, I decided to try it for the first time and bounced off within a week or two. This began a cycle that would repeat. I'd play League for a few months, bounce over to DotA due to frustration with League, and then I'd bounce off DotA again after a week or two because the game's hard lol.

Even so, this game is good enough that I cannot stop myself from coming back. Like a toxic relationship with great sex. I am powerless and at this point have accepted that I'm a DotA player, whether I want to be or not.

7122,This game taught me to be a racist. It feels good to win but at the same time you feel upset when you lose. Ranked games drives me nuts as I feel that I am on swamp. Too many smurfs and random players that can't play as a team. It is a very toxic game that will promote anger management skills.
7123,Please describe what you liked or disliked about this product
7124,I love the game I wanted to start playing again but honestly I cant play....the match making system is so broken that you cant find a match it's telling me I have to play 9 more ranked matches before it sets my rank because I left for so long. This is all fine I don't mind being re-calibrated.....but I actually cant find a match I am in 3 regions and I have waited 15 min and no match **** this game I am done trying if your game cant even actually form a match at the most basic lvl a basic lvl your own system puts the returning players in your game will fizzle out and die this is a total garbage way to bring back the people that are long time fans.....THE DEV TEAM SHOULD BE FIRED! I waited 17 min then left match making posted this review waited another 12 min now I am editing....I don't even want to support your trash game by playing it...who makes a game in 2022 that literally cant even find matches for its players when you have millions of players....WHAT GARBAGE!

Minuses: very toxic, evil, ignorant, weak, parasites, pieces of excrements, pathetic, bullies, weak mortals should suffer whole their pathetic mortal life. They will die as they lived: incipit and ignorant. Their ignorance will ensure their demise.
Pluses: Good effects, fun gameplay, diverse strategy, item builds, dynamic action, a lot of awesome heroes, good voice acting, a lot of fun game modes, music and CONCENTRATION!

7144,"If you're wondering whether to start playing this game or not NEVER download it. It's gonna take all your time motivation, you will be playing hard as fuck but you still will get freaking noobs in 50% of your games, I've spent 3600 hours in this game and I still can't get out of the first rank. I spent about $800 for in app purchases, wasted almost the same amount of time I spent for my bachelors degree and it's all for nothing I can't even get out of freaking first rank. So unless you wanna stream and make money out of your streams which is hard as fukc as well or unless you are 10 year old that wants to spent you whole life in this video game tryna become a pro player or something (which is super rare chance as well, you'll have to play at least 50k hours to probably but unlikely get close to pro players) or unless you don't give a fuck and just like to kill your precious time, then Never download this game. Hope I saved someones time and nerves writing this review, but tbh I'm sure nobody gives a ****."

7283,"My grandfather smoked his whole life. I was about 10 years old when my mother said to him, ""if you ever want to see your grandchildren graduate, you have to stop immediately"". Tears welled up in his eyes when he realized what exactly was at stake. He gave it up immediately. Three years later he died of lung cancer. It was really sad and destroyed me. My mother said to me - ""Don't ever smoke. Please don't put your family through what your Grandfather put us through"" I agree. At 22, I have never touched a cigarette. I must say, I feel a very slight sense of regret for  never having done it, because this game gave me cancer anyway."
7284,"Dota 2:
pluses:
-A huge variety of heroes
-New heroes, items and upgrades
- All heroes are free
-Various tactics and assemblies for any hero
-Variety of gameplay
-NOT AFFECTING the game donation
-Annual championships and events
- User games
-The possibility of becoming an eSportsman
- Beautiful hats, clothes and trunks

Result:
It's worth playing. Do not expect that everything will work out immediately, Dota 2 is very difficult to master, but then you yourself will understand that the developers tried to do everything as possible further."

Ephesians 6:10-18
New International Version
10 ""Finally, be strong in the Lord and in his mighty power. 11 Put on the full armor of God, so that you can take your stand against the devil‚Äôs schemes. 12 For our struggle is not against flesh and blood, but against the rulers, against the authorities, against the powers of this dark world and against the spiritual forces of evil in the heavenly realms. 13 Therefore put on the full armor of God, so that when the day of evil comes, you may be able to stand your ground, and after you have done everything, to stand. 14 Stand firm then, with the belt of truth buckled around your waist, with the breastplate of righteousness in place, 15 and with your feet fitted with the readiness that comes from the gospel of peace. 16 In addition to all this, take up the shield of faith, with which you can extinguish all the flaming arrows of the evil one. 17 Take the helmet of salvation and the sword of the Spirit, which is the word of God.

18 And pray in the Spirit on all occasions with all kinds of prayers and requests. With this in mind, be alert and always keep on praying for all the Lord‚Äôs people."""

s^h^i^t ranked mm : could you fix valve over 5 years later ?! :D or not

too small patch notes or even worse long major updates for a game that needs to be update like 3 weeks in month or month by month

all i can say this game is dead"
7365,jusr nice
7366,Very addictive
7367,Draining every mental energy you had left after a rough day at work. Consuming every bit of sanity in you making you infinitely insane with every game you have played. Trying the hardest not to insanely out of control is the least thing you wanna do if you are playing this game. Staining every dot in your previously pure heart with every sin in the world. Recommended tho.
7368,"Game has been heading downhill for years now. I technically left about 7 years ago with an mmr peak of 6400 having been achieved back in late 2012/early 2013.

The biggest correct criticism of this game is how the developers have for 7+ years now kept pushing the game in the direction of ""less uniqueness in any heroes or hero classes and make the game a League of Legends clone"" to the point now that every hero and hero mechanic type that USED to be unique and powerful because of a timing window for use is actually useless and can be countered by a huge number of no-brain heroes with automatically-done mechanics. 

They just hit 1 button and your high iq 20 button timing windowed tactic is now worthless. Heroes like Meepo and Broodmother or Nature's Prophet (or any ex-junglers) have been utterly destroyed and basically shouldn't even be in the game because its so easy to counter their much-more-complicated styles with a bunch of 1 button auto-mech abilities and heros.

Player numbers or not, this game peaked increasingly-long ago due to their wrong direction of development and ""balancing"". The mmr system is still ""modified elo"" aka ""we're too fking stupid to realize this system doesn't even fit this model of game"" and until the fix fundamental problems like these with the game, it will never be any good again.

Try something else, if you were looking for fun and a good future of a game, this one ain't it."

7482,"Too many toxic players. Lots of feeders and griefers in game. Because Dota wants more players to play their game, there is no punishment system. Matchmaking system also don't work. Games are overall unbalanced and lots of smurf players are in low-mid rank levels. Especially in the last years, Dota already lost lots of players who loved this game before. But where we stand today, this game is over and must not be played until real changes and reforms are made especially regarding penalty-punishment and matchmaking system."

7593,"For the first time in history of dota 2, a P2W mechanic was introduced as part of Dota Plus and since there was no consequences for Value, this gonna continue to grow. Not the game I started about 5 years ago. So, only playing unranked, turbo and custom games.

Detailed answer (particularly for nerds): 
Avoid list of dota plus is an example. I have not done a global stats to have a better estimation, but you can follow these steps to understand the effectiveness of it:
1. gather large amount of lets say 100 recent games of players in same bracket
2. find matches that same teammate appeared more than twice (ignoring friends)
3. calculate win/loss ratio: now it is expected that you have 50-50 ratio even in this subset which is random enough
4. Add teammates with lower than 25% win/lose ratio to avoid list
5. If matchmaking is working, then you would still end up with new teammates that have below 25% win/lose ratio but this is not the case at least in cases where I checked.

Note that I might be wrong and only the examples I checked are following this pattern, but statistically it is easy to verify given the vast amount of matches available publicly. I will do it in future and publish it.

Remark: probably you have heard of the joke: ""forced 50-50 ratio"" which means matchmaking is not doing fine and it forces lose/win by doing a full stomp matchmaking rather than a close one. So it means you can manipulate the matchmaking as it is not robust enough."

7644,"This is the best MOBA. It has the most depth, is the most interesting to watch, and has the highest quality gameplay. There is no surrender button because there is ALWAYS a way to win. You can be a mechanically good player that clicks a lot or a very chill player with a lot of knowledge and good communication skills. There's demand for both, and you can climb the mmr ladder without being an emotional teenage mid player with good fingers. 

This is the most satisfying game to get good at, but this game requires an intense time investment. And some players invest that time and never get good, some things just don't click.

This game is *so* good but it is painfully mismanaged. The game is getting visibly worse over time and almost all of my veteran friends have left this game. These aren't noob once in a while players either, these were all top 100-500 players that were highly immersed in competitive. Granted, time does pass and people have IRL responsibilities, but I still game, they still game. Just not this game!

1. No love

I am not convinced Icefrog(the game's creator) still works on this game. There seems to be no depth to any of the patches besides funny whacky micro mechanics that take 2 minutes to master. Over the last few years there has been a layering of new micro mechanics but a severe dumbing down of the essential macro gameplay that made this game good and dynamic to begin with. New heroes are cool, but the novelty fades quickly and still doesn't really change the macro play of the game.

The community has enabled Valve to put minimal effort into the game as long as skins and chests come out a few times a year. I do not at all blame Valve for doing this, because this is what the community wants and it generates money, but everyone has to wake up and realize that the more you beg for skins the more Valve is going to neglect gameplay changes for the quick cash.

The map has not substantially changed in over 2 years. It could actually even be more than that, but I don't care to check. Map changes drive creativity, thought, theory crafting, and meta changes! But instead we have a *dry* ooga-booga dual lane meta where players have sunk into lazy repetition(as does happen when patches eventually stagnate). And most people have forgotten how to play the game outside of a dual lane meta. It's actually really disheartening. ‚Äì
Over time this game has become more ""win lane win game"" because of gradual power creep that has been exacerbated by the dual lane meta. For a very very long time Dota was a game that could be won in many many many different ways, and there were plenty of educated tradeoffs you could make in games. Many of these tradeoffs are not really worth it anymore.

Remember recently when players realized the game was dying so they made a community tutorial and Valve just yoinked it and did double work for the same goal? The community is getting smaller, but they‚Äôre still trying to bring the game back. As I've said, the game is good. But Valve has proven to be ""in their own way"" and as time passes they seem to be more milking the game for any pennies left than putting TLC into it.

2. Competitive

Did anyone watch the last TI(2021)? Remember how exciting it was to watch VP play because they were being so creative with their drafts? The VP captain said that it was frustrating for their team to play the game in the current meta. I still remember his statement clearly: ""One team has tide, the other team has doom, they both stall the game until second Rosh and then hope they win the fight, and if they win that fight they win the game. We don't like that so we tried something different!"" I have never heard something like this said since I started watching in 2012. I've heard ""patch is stale"", but never ""the game is a coinflip"".

Dota2 shouldn‚Äôt be a ‚Äúcoinflip‚Äù game.

And the state of getting into competitive? This is something that I actually have firsthand experience in, so read what I'm about to say very carefully. Do *not* try to become a pro player. It is not worth it. It does not pay. It is a losing gamble. It will not fulfill you. You will make more money working at Walmart for 1 month. Anything that is not T1 competitive in Dota2 is a barren wasteland. There are no tournaments for T2 players to play in to make money. There are no sponsorships. There is only DPC which pays a painfully small amount for the amount of time + commitment required to play in DPC. 

Where does all the money go? Only the top teams that qualify for TI(16 teams across many countries) get paid, once a year. The top 2 teams win the lottery, everyone else gets a year‚Äôs salary. The last major(non TI event) paid 50k to first place, and mostly T1 teams(and some established T2 teams) play in that. Just remember that the 50k prize is for first place, everyone else gets next to nothing. If you don‚Äôt win 1st out of 16 teams? Well too bad that 10k to one player potentially being their year‚Äôs salary shrinks to 0. There is NO money outside of that going to any teams in T2 and lower. There might be a one-off tournament from time to time but it‚Äôs nowhere near enough money to live on. And why does it have to be a livable amount of money? Because the game is so complex that you need to be playing and learning *constantly* in order to achieve a level of skill viable for competitive.

T1 players have a monopoly on good gameplay, and T2 players generally do not have enough exposure to play quality games and absorb knowledge from T1 players. To any solo ranked players reading this: No, you're solo ranked mmr does not represent your skill in competitive. Competitive is a different beast. If your solo ranked mmr mattered then a lot of really bad top 100 players I know would be playing in TI. There are plenty of Divine players I know that I would rather play with competitively than some top 100 players. Solo ranked is a game of repetition, not skill.

Take a good hard look at the player profile photos in the next DPC you watch. Everyone in T1 looks comfortable, happy, and doing what they love. Everyone in T2 looks ill. It‚Äôs not their fault, it‚Äôs because they make almost nothing and spend most of their time refining their skills ever-so-slightly to still never make it in Dota. This is the cold hard truth. 90% of talented T2 players will not make it to a tournament that pays more than 5k$ to first place. There was a well known T2 player recently that killed himself, a complete and utter tragedy. If I had continued down the road through T2 I might‚Äôve been in a similar situation. There are no rewards. There are no chances. It‚Äôs a losing gamble and you will not win. Do not try to become a pro.

3. Community

The average Dota2 player is an overgrown man-child. Whiney. Aggressive. Certain. There are really cool people that play this game. I‚Äôve made great friends playing. But most of the people I‚Äôve interacted with have wished the most gruesome death upon me because I played the game wrong *in their opinion*. And most players have no idea what they‚Äôre talking about, which makes this especially hilarious. And the only way to get them to shut up is to 1-up them in one way or another.

The Dota2 Reddit, pretty much the largest place where people talk about Dota, does not at all represent the community. Everyone on Reddit puts on a nice face, but when they step into game they are a unique version of *absolutely awful*. It‚Äôs a toxic game. It‚Äôs a toxic community. If you want to excommunicate the toxic guys, you‚Äôll get rid of the entire playerbase. ‚Äì

Conclusion

So the game is good. The community is awful. Valve doesn‚Äôt take care of any competitive players outside of T1. Competitive is dying. Valve doesn‚Äôt really care because the general playerbase doesn‚Äôt care. It‚Äôs getting less fun to watch. Gameplay is stagnating and dumbed down. Based on Valve‚Äôs actions over the last 2 years, nothing will change.

Do not play this game, go read a book or play guitar instead. Only took me 15k hours to realize."

Designed and animated by John Dota, this game is surely a sight for sore eyes. When I first plugged in my n64 usb controller to begin playing this new gem, my hands immediately started shaking and sweating with anticipation. 10 seconds into my first game, I already knew that this game had the charm and atmosphere of a 2009 Call of Duty lobby, But hey, don't listen to me and my comprehensive, on the pulse review.

I really thought it'd get better because this game really is fun with a team. I mean, the player toxicity isn't the game's fault. That's on the the toxic players who just want to talk abusively to others. BUT I can't leave a game after ALL 4 players on my team had DC'ed and left, without a penalty?! How does that make any sense??? This game is really fun and probably is giving good experiences to other solo players. But this solo player is disappointed and done, probably until I get a team which isn't my main concern and thus will take quite a while."

7725,"A good game with an old player base that hates children and themselves.

""Every beginner is a child""

Game: 7.5/10
Player Base: 3/10

I've been a DOTA player since 2007, I was in grade 6, good 'ol days. But that was DOTA 1, a Warcraft III custom map, this is DOTA 2. The game has grown a lot since then. As a game that I grew up with, I would recommend this, nobody wants to see their childhood game die. As a game in itself, yes, it is still recommendable. You can counter heroes with heroes, counter heroes with items, and so on. There are imbalances, developers takes too long to fix them that some say they're almost non-existent, but the game is  still playable.

You have to set your expectations real. This is a MOBA where competition is beyond comprehension. Expectations per game are consistently high on all ranks, even in low rank games. You'll laugh in irony because teammates will expect you to be mechanically skilled and guess who's trash talking, a player ranked lower than you.
*As I was typing this, my player base rating got lower*

So as a beginner, you have to brace yourself, mute all comms, and focus only on improving. Develop your skill to ignore trolls and trash talkers, don't let them get to you. Some people get off by ruining other's day, yes, people like that exist even in real life, such sickness. I'm not saying everyone in this game is like that but if you see peaceful people in this game. Some are kind even if you are being stomped. Some encourage you when you make mistakes and gives you opportunity to fix them. They are rare, treasure them, and enjoy the game while it lasts."

7842,"I decided to tell about DotA,
 and confess the whole truth to you,
 how to become a professional
 and how to bend all the crayfish!

 Remember the simple rule
 that your life is now the past,
 from morning to night you play
 and fuck everyone around!

 Always take Pudge mid
 and hook swing you without shame,
 because crayfish in the team will not be dragged,
 only your gold will be taken away!

 Forget about wards and supports,
 do not be afraid of these reports,
 because you are chosen by Gabin,
 the right-handed player.

 Around you - only morons,
 you don't have enough power for everyone
 allies are your enemies,
 run away from them.

 Don't listen to the lies about your mother
 and all this melodrama
 that you have all the fathers here,
 and the cabbage rolls are sleeping at home.

 Don't believe stories about claws
 and faces as red as cherries,
 because they are all on fire,
 from fierce envy of you.

 Three years have gone by,
 esports approach,
 and now for sure
 coveted rating - 4k


 P.S.  The poem is purely humorous in nature, all the best :)"

7870,stupida fackeeng gaem
7871,"Don't play this if u have a life, you will loose it!"

7873,xD
7874,so good
7875,GIVE ME MATCH PLS!
7876,"This game is always something fun to come back to, it never really gets boring to me since there's SO many hero's to choose from and they're all great in their own way. All of them are free to play right off so there's no spending outside cash to unlock any of them. If you do want to spend money on skins they do range from dirt cheap (like $3 or less) to hundreds. Best MOBA as far as I'm concerned :)"
7877,BEST GAME EVER CREATED IMO
7878,"Do you want to turn your soul as black as tar? Your personality as toxic as Asbestos? Your real life as functional as an AMC-Gremlin? Get your blood pressure as high a BP Oil pipeline (before bursting)? Then this games for you!

If you want to remain a normal, functioning human - look away and hide this game from view in the Steam interface."

BROKEN BETA GAMES.

Dota 1 wasn't like that back then. Steam has ruined it with this MMR system.

7995,THE WORST GAME I HAVE PLAYED TEAM PACKS PLAYERS WHO PLAY 10 TIMES WORSE THAN THE OPPONENT. IT IS NOT POSSIBLE TO WIN WHEN THE DECENCY IS 10 K
7996,"Left LoL after finding this game around 1 year into playing league with friends in highschool(about 2014). I loved Dota right off the bat, the first thing that stuck out to me was that nothing except cosmetics can be bought or unlocked.

My League friends unfortunately never got it. I had to keep playing League with them, they refused to give the game more than a few hours each. Crushed me, still bitter about that to this day.

My love for Dota turned into a total obsession. I learned as much as I could, and played whenever I had the time. I was so inspired by Fear and Dendi's stories in Free to Play, I wanted to go the distance myself. I saw Dota as the one path for me to turn my boundless enthusiasm for strategy games into freedom from jobs I didn't love and a place I didn't want to live. The one rope I could use to pull upward into the future I wanted for myself. Of course, I decided to become a professional Dota player. 

This wasn't meant to be.

I was working as a busboy at the time and would work my shift and come home at night and play, then work again without any significant breaks. I would go 24-48hrs without sleep regularly to play as much Dota as I could without missing any work. Went to 1 LAN and placed 2nd, that was one of my favorite experiences in my life. Also met people from all over the world and learned words(mostly curses heh) from languages I would have otherwise never encountered, got to practice my Spanish a bit too. I grew so much as a person from the interactions I had in Dota. It shaped me.

Despite my extreme(and overzealous and counterproductive in retrospect) dedication I never got above 3.6k MMR. What happened instead was that I ended up in the mental hospital from playing between 5 and 22 ranked matches a day and not sleeping on top of working my full time job bussing tables(which I worked as hard as I could at as well). When I got to the hospital I was 135lbs(I am 5'11"") and hadn't eaten or slept for 6 days, and was in full blown manic psychosis. Maybe if I had been provided for and fully supported during this time(and born without bipolar disorder) by my parents, I could have done it. We'll never know, but that's what happened. What I did was the epitome of the adage: ""burning the candle from both ends"". I flew too close to the sun and crashed and burned in the flames of psychosis and malnutrition. 

It's been almost 6 years since that episode of mania. Don't worry guys, I'm fine now, I sleep and eat every single day and have never had a recurrence of mania. I use medication to stabilize my mood whenever that pattern fails. Although I still enjoy the game a lot, I really only play turbo on and off since that's what I have time for. Gone are the dreams.

I know I spent a lot of time on this game, and I will regret somewhat my failure to become pro for the rest of my life. At one point it was everything to me. I lived, breathed, and dreamed it. That said, I look back on all that time with nostalgia and fondness. This is a game that will one way or another leave an impression on the rest of your life. You will either give up at less than 50 hours, or you will never forget it. 

How can I not recommend that?
It's a masterpiece.

The company couldn't care less about the community, the only way you can avoid a toxic behavior player is if you pay a monthly subscription.
If u compare DOTA and League Of Legends for example LOL has a serious punishment for toxic behavior DOTA only wants to make money out of it so if you don't want to suffer play another game...."

8034,I kinda like the Game
8035,"I've been playing it  for years and I love playing it. But one thing I've learnt is that you can't play it with a baby's mind because at some point Dota 2 is not fair matching up players in the games or has a lot of toxic players are playing it. And yet Dota 2 still does not make good enough punishment for those kind of players to keep people who'd like to play to enjoy and achieve their golds in the game. at least some players are trying to get higher medals, but matchmaking sucks and keeps dragging them down. So it's kind of disappointing."

8345,"I am a 58 yo father, probably one of the oldest people playing this game. I am a single father to my Son, who is 14 now. My son got this game for his birthday from his uncle, so we installed it on his computer and he started playing. By the end of the week he had 40 hours on this game. This was horrible for me, as it was already hard for me to find ways to spend time with my son, as he is always out with his friends or just watching Ukrainian men French kissing canines on YouTube. So i decided to make a Steam account and get this game to see if I could maybe play alongside him. I loaded into the game, picked my character and started playing but I was stuck on what you where supposed to do. I asked my Son for help and he hosted a game for me to join. I loved it as it was the best time I had spent with my son since my wife had died. This game has ever since brought me and my son closer again and now we actually spend time together outside the house together as well. This game reminded me that there's fun to be had in everything, and it has brought both me and my Son many happy memories.

8462,"Hi guys I usually do MASSIVE Reviews, however I have played this game all my life even during school years. 

This is probably the best hardcore competitive game you would ever play similar to CS/Wow/SC2(Starcraft)/ Battlefield. Same level of intensity and even more. The team work in this game is Astonishing. Communicating with your team while simultaneously casting hero spells/magical spells in the right time, rhythm of game-play, and Countering opponents successfully. Synergy is very important in this game. Dota 2 literately relies on TEAM SKILLS and TEAM CONTRIBUTION. 

The workshop is one of the best thing they have brought into the game. Tese amazing 3D artists constantly creating weapons, armour, costume designs and more. 

I can review this forever on 90% positive feedbacks.

Here is the other way around, im a lvl 2 trying to learn the mechanics and characters and my teammates seem to be new aswell but the other team is a party of 5 going everywhere together clapping everyone since we can't have the same coordination, plus my friend checked one of their acc and this person had over 1500 matches played.

The people who leave negative reviews for this game are probably the same people who pause the game to BM and destroy their items if they don't like how the match is going...

Ingredients:

1. 6 tablespoons unsalted butter
2. 1/2 cup white sugar
3. 1/2 cup brown sugar
4. 1/4 cup water
5. 1/4 teaspoon cinnamon
6. 1 pinch salt
7. 5 apples - peeled, cored and sliced
8. 1 pastry for double-crust pie

Directions:

1. Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C).
2. Combine butter, white sugar, brown sugar, water, cinnamon, and salt in a saucepan over medium heat. Bring to a boil, remove from heat and set aside.
3. Roll out half the pastry to fit a 9-inch pie plate. Place bottom crust in pie plate; pour in apple slices.
4. Roll out top crust into a 10-inch circle. Cut into 8 (1-inch) wide strips with a sharp paring knife or pastry wheel. Weave the pastry strips, one at a time, into a lattice pattern. Fold the ends of the lattice strips under the edge of the bottom crust and crimp to seal.
5. Pour butter-sugar mixture over top of pie, coating the lattice, and allowing any remaining sauce to drizzle through the crust.

However, every once in a while you play a game that's so good, whether it's your skills or the teamwork or the nice people telling you to keep trying, that you can't help but constantly seek out those rare games. I've met incredible people from all over the world through Dota 2,  and I'll keep playing it despite the fact I am still horrible at this game after 5K hours"

But most games will involve people who have low tolerance and anger management issues.

Don't play this game, not because it sucks, but because you'll find your mental health declining."

8786,"I am a 56 yo father, probably one of the oldest people playing Dota 2. I am a single father to my Son, who is 15 now. My son recently started playing Dota 2. After less than a week, he already had 20 hours of playtime. This was horrible for me, as it was already hard for me to find ways to spend time with my son, as he is always out with his friends or just watching YouTube. So I decided to make a Steam account to play with my Son. I started playing, but this was my first time playing a video game since the 90's, so i was quite lost. I asked my Son for help and together we spend hours playing Dota 2. I loved it as it was the best time I had spent with my Son since my wife had died. Steam has ever since brought me and my Son closer again and now we actually spend time together outside the house together as well. Dota 2 reminded me that there's fun to be had in everything, and it has brought both me and my Son many happy memories."

just play this cursed game when you:
- waste a lot of lifetime on useless things
- have 1/2 chance that you wait 6 mins for the game, then pick 5 mins and have 1 guy leave the game ( so basically 1 guy can screw 15 mins waiting for 9 other ppl)
- have 1/3 chance of 1 guy ruining the game (this time in-game) for all the others
- want to join a toxic community

The graphic in World of Warcraft: Frozen Throne, the birth of Dota 1, was unique in its own style and breathtaking. Unfortunately, Dota 2 has abandoned this very core value.

8918,"After I've been playing this game for 3,700 hrs in this ID + 3,000 hrs(in other IDs) I could tell you all now that this game has a really good community! they taught me how to be brave and confident! I'm able to overcome many hardships ever since playing this game! Language barrier, race, nationality, role. All of that doesn't matter! as long as you can remain steadfast, you can achieve anything you wish! With that being said, I'm now telling you with honest, clear and concise that I've become a toxic player to the fucking core!! You won't get hurt from the toxic players if you're the toxic player yourself. If you want the community where they will fuck you up and disrespect you in every way possible for every single mistake (or even when you did no sh1t!) you committed then this game is a green light! so go for it! experience it and become a toxic right to the fucking core just like me!"

8952,"f you're looking for a review on this game you've come to the wrong place, but if you're looking for an outstanding pie recipe you've come to the right place.

Ingredients:

1. 6 tablespoons unsalted butter
2. 1/2 cup white sugar
3. 1/2 cup brown sugar
4. 1/4 cup water
5. 1/4 teaspoon cinnamon
6. 1 pinch salt
7. 5 apples - peeled, cored and sliced
8. 1 pastry for double-crust pie

Directions:

1. Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C).
2. Combine butter, white sugar, brown sugar, water, cinnamon, and salt in a saucepan over medium heat. Bring to a boil, remove from heat and set aside.
3. Roll out half the pastry to fit a 9-inch pie plate. Place bottom crust in pie plate; pour in apple slices.
4. Roll out top crust into a 10-inch circle. Cut into 8 (1-inch) wide strips with a sharp paring knife or pastry wheel. Weave the pastry strips, one at a time, into a lattice pattern. Fold the ends of the lattice strips under the edge of the bottom crust and crimp to seal.
5. Pour butter-sugar mixture over top of pie, coating the lattice, and allowing any remaining sauce to drizzle through the crust.
6. Bake in the preheated oven for 15 minutes. Reduce heat to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C), and bake until the crust is golden brown, the caramel on the top crust is set, and the apple filling is bubbling, 35 to 40 more minutes. Allow to cool completely before slicing.
enjoy :')

9082,"The developers (25-30 people for such a massive game) don't give a shit about updating the game. They are literally milking you with dota plus (a 5 dollar monthly sub for features that are hidden behind a pay wall) and releasing +-5 damage patches, yet there are dozens copium inhaling addicts who will continue playing this game because at the end of the day - this is the only game you are good at.

Competetive scene is a complete joke, we went from community tournaments with huge majors to online DPC systems with TI that will be forcefully prolonged for a whole month with the same quantity of games. The only reason esports side of the game still lives on is due to the tournament constantly beating the previous years prizepool, making at least 1 kotaku journalist to give a shit about this game. 
Want a comparison of devs who atleast try? Check Leagues (our favourite competitor) marketing and compare it with Dota's - its a joke, there is a reason why its more popular and its not because the game is easier or harder. 

The game that is a 5v5, does not incentivise players to group up and play together. Normal games are a waste of time where people tryhard regardless of the game mode. Ranked matchmaking is played mostly by solo players since it rewards +30 instead of +20 with party (the extra 10 really is worth isnt it)

There is no learning curve for new players since there is no tutorials and welcoming system + there are no new players to begin with. You will be greeted with people thrown into your game who are way above your level and have more expirience than you, so atleast 1000 hours is required to even understand what is going on. 

I fluently speak russian and english yet I get equaly annoyed by both of these groups of primates. The level of voice communication that you will expirience in this god forsaken game is worth mentioning in the last floor of Hell. The sheer amount of toxicity (not the casual FU, actual pure racism, hate and rage) is just out of this world. People playing this game should actually get clinically checked for basic communication and human interaction responses. You will spend the majority of your gameplay muting 8-9 players per game, and like I said before - playing solo is the only way people play. 

Overall - I had my good memories with the game, I used it as a coping mechanism during my darkest moments in life and I am grateful for those rare moments of pure bliss and ignorance. 
If you are still reading and considering playing this game - please don't. There is a whole steam library worth of great MMO's and single player games that can fill your day,

9152,"I've been playing dota since dota 1 days aprox 2008. 
I don't mind how the game has changed ever since. It's actually cool and I love it. 

But the player pool & match up system... It's a headache. I will not lie, I abandon sometimes. I sometimes delete dota for months. I simply don't understand how is it possible to Match me up with somebody who is playing for his 2nd, 3rd time. 

Why? Why can't I play balanced games anymore?

"
9153,"SO MUCH CANCER ? 

Like all these people that reviewed this game, hate the game but addicted to playing it.
The game itself is good actually and well-made but one reason for disliking this game is that people expect only winning from this game they think they are the true legend and their team is trash but losing is 50% of game if you can not accept your loss do not play this game. What doesn't kill you makes you stronger."
9154,not toxic whatsoever
9155,good game
9156,not worth your life if you know you suck
9157,"The most-played game on Steam.
Every day, millions of players worldwide enter battle as one of over a hundred Dota heroes. And no matter if it's their 10th hour of play or 1,000th, there's always something new to discover. With regular updates that ensure a constant evolution of gameplay, features, and heroes, Dota 2 has truly taken on a life of its own.

One Battlefield. Infinite Possibilities.
When it comes to diversity of heroes, abilities, and powerful items, Dota boasts an endless array‚Äîno two games are the same. Any hero can fill multiple roles, and there's an abundance of items to help meet the needs of each game. Dota doesn't provide limitations on how to play, it empowers you to express your own style.

All heroes are free.
Competitive balance is Dota's crown jewel, and to ensure everyone is playing on an even field, the core content of the game‚Äîlike the vast pool of heroes‚Äîis available to all players. Fans can collect cosmetics for heroes and fun add-ons for the world they inhabit, but everything you need to play is already included before you join your first match.

Bring your friends and party up.
Dota is deep, and constantly evolving, but it's never too late to join.
Learn the ropes playing co-op vs. bots. Sharpen your skills in the hero demo mode. Jump into the behavior- and skill-based matchmaking system that ensures you'll
be matched with the right players each game."

9167,nice game bad community bcz of russians
9168,they will call your mom than teach you how to play
9169,"This game has a fair number of bugs in it, the community in actual players vs players is toxic. There are many rage quitters, leavers, afk'rs and bots. The only value this game has is in the solo vs bots, and even then, on the unfair mode.. everything you get hit with is always max +50%.

Chaos bolts from the chaos knight, ALWAYS at max rank, STUN FOR 6 FULL SECONDS. Basically your screwed if you get hit with it.

Another problem with the AI bots, is they will always GANK / Gang up on you with their full team, over any other target. If you however pose a threat to them, they will run away. They see you in stealth, they can always attack you if you have any clones. Knowing which of you and your clones, is always the real one. Expect to be the primary target, every time, every match.

I get that its supposed to be unfair, but, to have your entire team of bots, completely do stupid things like having a single one of them, charge into 5.. feeding them intentionally, time and time again. There's stupid, and then there's whoever coded this is really stupid."

9178,"Got called racial slurs and got wished covid upon in my first game. I said ""ok, maybe this is just one of a kind, I'll just mute this guy and move on""

The next 5 games all had at least 2 people from my team cussing me in multiple languages / each other and dc'ing / griefing. I learnt more than duolingo.

I see you need like 250 hours to get out of unranked. Don't waste your time.
Only recommended if you got a group of 10 friends / don't mind playing with bots or like custom maps."
9179,"If you thought that people playing league of legends are toxic you will change your mind after playing dota.
People here don't care if you have played 2h or 200h they will be the same to you. 
Trash talk you non stop even if you make one small mistake but when they make game losing mistake you have to shut up and don't talk cuz you made small mistake once."

9201,"Would play this game more, but I play way to many different games.

Still a solid moba game after all this years. Used to play Dota way back, when I played Warcraft 3.
Simpler times.. anyway.
Community still as toxic as any other moba game... So be prepared for salt :)
The games can become very drag out, when people doesn't want to team up properly. But It is still nice to just play and forget about life.
But I love the attention to details of the character models.. And lets not talk about all the customization of the appearance of the different heroes. ( Skins, you don't need to use a full sets. You can combined different skins parts with each other to be more unique and match them how you like.. the ""skins"" )

And yes, Venomancer doesn't even come close to how toxic some people can be. ( Be prepared )

And the voice actors of the heroes ( 10/10 )"

9404,"Great game, don't play it."
9405,The match maker is very bad. Players are playing any hero in any role and there is no action taken for role report. players are not taking the ranked roles seriously and this is spoiling others game. Now i am begining to belive that matchmaker is made such that we should not rank up. Many players have shifted to other games because of this. Very very bad experience playing DOTA now. Waste of time and energy.
9406,This game full of cancer player and waste ppl a lot of time in this game.should give a surrender button for this game so that we can save time when cancer player appear in our game.

I already speak abour this shit matchmaking but that shit programmers wont listen and said the matchmaking tailored by many criterias. Criteria my ass if only bring shit players.

9489,"I want to preface this review by apologizing for not writing this sooner. I have lost many friends to this game, solely because the game consumed their mental and probably physical state too. 5 irl friends and counting. Luckily, I managed to escape this absolute shitshow back in 2016 and have strayed FAR away from ever actively playing again. GOD FORBID anyone else should experience even 24 hours of this degenerate, basement rat-dwelling community that Valve had to spawn from deeper than the 7th layer of hell. I'm sure humans were sacrificed at an altar to create this absolutely horrific clown meetup; It's like I'm watching Gaben resurrect Charles Manson so that he can create another cult of Dota 2 players losing their brain cells. Great Christ I do pray that anyone who reads this comment *DOES NOT* install this game or play any hours further, or you might find yourself in a limbo that the strongest shrooms could never imagine getting you there. You're Welcome and Cya."

9500,"The matchmaking really sucks. Its so annoying that I am not able to play with people that has similar skill as me. Currently I am expriencing really mental breakdown, cause I have lost like 35 matches of my last 40 matches. Its not that I am bad or new to the game. its just server does not really matching me with similar skilled players. Either I matched with trios, duos, or 4 men group, where obviously miscomunication really really often occur, or I am matched with really skilled players and smurfs. This is where the most annoying parts begin. If my teammates happen to be smurfs, the match really does not make sense anymore, cause I have literally nothing to do. If my other teams got a smurf, then its literally torture. If I play well in my games, server matches me with really bad teammates. So this game is really fun to play, but matchmaking NEEDS TO BE REALLY FIXED. Cause I can no longer tolerate this kind of bad matchmaking. I used to love to play, but now Its just waste of nerve and time. The wors matchmaking PC game. ever. PS: FUCK VALVE!"

9567,"I was in the picking lobby, I picked my character. Then during the pre-buy menu before the game officially starts it takes my character away from me as i'm buying items and says someone else wanted a ""cookie"" so you don't get to eat your ""cookie"". So I dodged and then I get multiple reports and can't play for 22 minutes all because everyone needs to get a cookie even though it was my ""cookie"". I think I might just play the original DotA on Warcraft 3 or I think I'm just going to go play League of Legends because at least I can play my character after I choose it."

9571,"The game design is stuck in the past. They care so much about being the evolution of Warcraft Dota, that they fail to evolve the gameplay. Play League of Legend. Hell, play Heroes of the Storm. Both are superior in game design and simplicity. If you're new to MOBAs, this game will suffocate you with complicated systems. 
I fully expect this review to get shit on, but the veterans haven't experienced something better, nor do they care to try. Do yourself a favor and stay away from this dated game. I put over 350 hours into this game, and after trying League, I came back once, only to realize how bad it was.
Edit: In one of my last games, another player said ""Go back to League. This game looks better anyways."" This speaks volumes about the Dota player base. They secretly know the truth, but are desperate for an excuse to why their game is better: ""graphics."""

Secondly dont listen to all the clickbait videos or comments about how dota is ""dying"", listen here u little sh*ts topping the damn steam charts isnt dying, and its hard to grow even more after that point cause theres always new games of other genres people go to try out and have fun so its not even really that dota is losing to any competition or anything cause it doesnt have any.
So the final word is I repeat best moba to ever exist unless they do some stupid shit like making you buy heroes to play with them cough cough.

9646,"If you're looking for a review on this game you've come to the wrong place, but if you're looking for an outstanding pie recipe you've come to the right place.

Ingredients:

1. 6 tablespoons unsalted butter
2. 1/2 cup white sugar
3. 1/2 cup brown sugar
4. 1/4 cup water
5. 1/4 teaspoon cinnamon
6. 1 pinch salt
7. 5 apples - peeled, cored and sliced
8. 1 pastry for double-crust pie

Directions:

1. Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C).
2. Combine butter, white sugar, brown sugar, water, cinnamon, and salt in a saucepan over medium heat. Bring to a boil, remove from heat and set aside.
3. Roll out half the pastry to fit a 9-inch pie plate. Place bottom crust in pie plate; pour in apple slices.
4. Roll out top crust into a 10-inch circle. Cut into 8 (1-inch) wide strips with a sharp paring knife or pastry wheel. Weave the pastry strips, one at a time, into a lattice pattern. Fold the ends of the lattice strips under the edge of the bottom crust and crimp to seal.
5. Pour butter-sugar mixture over top of pie, coating the lattice, and allowing any remaining sauce to drizzle through the crust.
6. Bake in the preheated oven for 15 minutes. Reduce heat to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C), and bake until the crust is golden brown, the caramel on the top crust is set, and the apple filling is bubbling, 35 to 40 more minutes. Allow to cool completely before slicing."

9653,"A MOBA for the purests. It is better than LoL in aspects as you can deny creeps, keeping the tradition of the original DOTA 1 alive. It's right on par with LoL, but keeping the denying is great. I do think the hero selection and abilities are better, but to be fair that's subjective. Is this better than LoL, it depends if you like challenges and taking it to the highest level of MOBA's where include other elements of MOBA's not in LoL. However, LoL has better match making, but I think the game play is 100% better in DOTA2. 5/5 rating for me. I have LoL as a 5/5 rating too for the mildly simpler game play, though both have a super learning curve. Requires patience and understanding. Highly recommended if you enjoy MOBA's and are coming from LoL looking for something similar, but different."

In practice, the game has an awful tendency to turn normal people into monsters. Not everybody is vulnerable to this, but I've seen it happen to some degree to myself and many of my friends - the game just makes people ridiculously toxic.

9722,"You like Huey Lewis and the News? Their early work was a little too new wave for my taste. But when Sports came out in '83, I think they really came into their own, commercially and artistically. The whole album has a clear, crisp sound, and a new sheen of consummate professionalism that really gives the songs a big boost. He's been compared to Elvis Costello, but I think Huey has a far more bitter, cynical sense of humour. In '87, Huey released this; Fore!, their most accomplished album. I think their undisputed masterpiece is ""Hip To Be Square"". A song so catchy, most people probably don't listen to the lyrics. But they should, because it's not just about the pleasures of conformity and the importance of trends. It's also a personal statement about the band itself.

Doo doo doo
I'm packed and I'm holding
I'm smiling, she's living, she's golden
She lives for me, says she lives for me
Ovation, her own motivation
She comes round and she goes down on me
And I make you smile, like a drug for you
Do ever what you wanna do, coming over you
Keep on smiling, what we go through
One stop to the rhythm that divides you
And I speak to you like the chorus to the verse
Chop another line like a coda with a curse
Come on like a freak show takes the stage
We give them the games we play, she said
I want something else to get me through this
Semi-charmed kinda life, baby, baby
I want something else, I'm not listening when you say good-bye

Doo doo doo, doo doo-doo doo
Doo doo doo, doo doo-doo doo

The sky was gold, it was rose
I was taking sips of it through my nose
And I wish I could get back there, someplace back there
Smiling in the pictures you would take
Doing crystal meth, will lift you up until you break
It won't stop, I won't come down
I keep stock with a tick-tock rhythm, a bump for the drop
And then I bumped up, I took the hit that I was given
Then I bumped again, then I bumped again
I said
How do I get back there to the place where I fell asleep inside you
How do I get myself back to the place where you said
I want something else to get me through this
Semi-charmed kinda life, baby, baby
I want something else, I'm not listening when you say good-bye
I believe in the sand beneath my toes
The beach gives a feeling, an earthy feeling
I believe in the faith that grows
And that four right chords can make me cry
When I'm with you I feel like I could die
And that would be alright, alright
And when the plane came in, she said she was crashing
The velvet it rips in the city, we tripped on the urge to feel alive
Now I'm struggling to survive
Those days you were wearing that velvet dress
You're the priestess, I must confess
Those little red panties they pass the test
Slides up around the belly, face down on the mattress
One
And you hold me, and we are broken
Still it's all that I wanna do, just a little now
Feel myself, heading off the ground
I'm scared, I'm not coming down
No, no
And I won't run for my life
She's got her jaws now locked down in a smile
But nothing is alright, alright
And I want something else to get me through this life
Baby, I want something else
Not listening when you say
Goodbye, goodbye, goodbye, goodbye
Doo doo doo, doo doo-doo doo
Doo doo doo, doo doo-doo doo
Doo doo doo, doo doo-doo doo
The sky was gold, it was rose
I was taking sips of it through my nose
And I wish I could get back there
Someplace back there, in the place we used to start

My son got this game for Christmas from his uncle, so we installed it on his computer and he started playing. By the end of the week he had 24 hours on this game. This was horrible for me, as it was already hard for me to find ways to spend time with my son, as he is always out with his friends or just, watching YouTube. So i decided to make a Steam account and get this game to see if I could maybe play alongside him. loaded into the game, made my character and world and started playing but I was stuck on what you where supposed to do. I asked my Son for help and he hosted a game for me to join. loved it as it was the best time had spent with my Son since my wife had died. This game has ever since brought me and my son closer again and now we actually spend time together outside the house together as well. This game reminded me that there's fun to be had in everything, and it has brought both me and my Son many happy memories."

9856,"More RPG than MOBA in my opinion. Heroes of the Storm does everything better (imo) when it comes to representing what MOBAs should be: Easy to get into but hard to master, eliminates archaic systems like last-hitting and individual experience in favor of teamplay and more frequent team fights, multiple maps which give players reasons for picking obscure or off meta heroes, etc. etc. Heroes does the MOBA genre better."
9857,It's free to play but will take your sanity as payment.

9880,This game is not good for beginner. It became more complex over time. Bunch of old people only in this game.
9881,"Ever since I started Dota 2, I didn't need any other game to pass my time."
9882,this game is complicated and if you are new you will be destroyed by other people
9883,"If you value your mental health don't pick up this game , it's like gambling, losing your life, time and money to have a chance of gratification for a few seconds, it's toxic community and abysmal matchmaking is enough to ruin your experience no matter how hard to try to love the game design and it's heroes. unless you've got a group of friends who really want to try and improve and play together don't even think about playing this game."

Avoid this game you have anger issues, it will drive you mad as your team will often disappoint.

But! & it's a big one;
I don't like this game.

I prefer other games.
There are elements of other similarly styled games that feel more GUI friendly.

This game feels like a sandbox mod.
You can't explain how advanced it looks to professional gamers & commentators versus the general populace.

You're not going to 'get' '[i]it[/i]'.

I wouldn't recommend this game.
But I'm recommending this game.

you can access this game. For free.

After beta times Dota 2 was astonishing, and was one of my favourites. But dynamics of MOBA changed itself, companies give and take and even final product is not satisfying DotA2 was a game changer game and 1st among MOBA still.

I started writing reviews for my collection and had no other words for DotA. Thanks Steam and developers of DotA."

The game is well polished, can offer a great challange, its a blast, but you need to give it some time because there are alot of things to keep track of and the learning curve can be pretty steep at times, so dont be to harsh on yourself, try to learn from your mistakes and by the end you will be a better player for it.

Biggest drawback is the community, most players are grown-babies that love to complain all mistakes on others in a team based game, but there are great people playing it and if you come across one on your team, be friendly and add them to have a greater experience in the game.

10287,"‚úû One of the best games of all time. In it corresponds both team game, and single. No matter how you play, you fall in love with her, and every time you leave, or when you relax between playing and studying, you will miss her because it is no longer a secret, but Internet games have become our second by personality. And when you start it after a long break, you realize how much you missed. Play not for the sake of victory, but for the pleasure of extending the era of Dota 2 ‚úû"

10307,"After 3000 hrs (majority of it being in the arcade) I can say this game can be fun if you put the time into it to learn, of course you're going to encounter toxic players, it's inevitable with online games these days sadly.

Glad to see it's been updated more for new players, the tutorial given an overhaul since the Netflix series released

10416,"Despicable Me is a computer-animated media franchise centering on Gru, a reformed super-villain (who later becomes a father, husband, and secret agent), and his yellow-colored Minions. It is produced by Illumination and distributed by its parent company Universal Pictures. The franchise began with the 2010 film of the same name, which was followed by two sequels, Despicable Me 2 (2013), Despicable Me 3 (2017), and a future sequel, Despicable Me 4, expected to hit theaters in 2024; and by two spin-off prequels, Minions (2015) and the upcoming Minions: The Rise of Gru (2022). The franchise also includes many short films, a television special, several video games, and a theme park attraction. It is the highest-grossing animated film franchise and the 15th highest-grossing film franchise of all time, having grossed over $3.7 billion globally."

10421,"What can I say? It‚Äôs Dota 2, the game you should absolutely never ever play. Not even as a joke. It you‚Äôre a Dota fan, you‚Äôre already playing it, and will never read this review. (Unless you‚Äôre one of THOSE weirdoes!) If you haven‚Äôt played it, don‚Äôt. It‚Äôs just as bad as it was a decade ago. The ‚ÄòNew Player Mode‚Äô and revamped tutorials doesn‚Äôt fix this games core problem with attracting new players‚Ä¶ That is to say, the legendary toxicity of the current player base.

You know the game is toxic when that‚Äôs the first thing most people learn about your game, sometimes even before its name. Unless you‚Äôre the kind of person who likes triggering people on Twitter, just don‚Äôt bother. Go do literally anything else with your time.

As for me, I did enjoy this game for quite a while, but that ship has sailed. I simply do not have the patience anymore to deal with people with the emotional maturity of a preschooler, who mistakenly believe that losing a game is a death sentence IRL. Thanks, but no thanks.

P.S. Hoodwink is best girl."

I have felt my throat close and I lose my breath. I've cried like a baby and kicked the furniture.

10496,"Over 5000 hours of play. Although it is closer to 10k as I played the original on the WC3 engine back in the day. I am 39, a grizzled veteran of the Dota conflict. My tours of duty are numerous and not very distinguished. 
Can I recommend this game to you?
That depends. My friends and I were chatting, all of them long term Dota addi...players too, and we came to consensus that if we knew what we know now about Dota would we begin playing it? 

The answer is No.  

This is not based on the game itself, it is a good game. It is constantly evolving and the community and Valve take active measures to keep it fresh. The problem is the insane amount of knowledge you have to have in order to play this game well. The learning curve is more like a learning wall, and it is legendary. A wall that you hurtle towards in a vehicle made entirely of ignorance and naivety, with no breaks. 

Sure, you can potter around with Sniper or Axe and have fun messing with bots, but competitively, you will be eviscerated. The fun will leave your body faster than you can produce it. That's right, this game is a fun vacuum. To this day, with decent W/L stats on most of my heroes I am made to feel like an absolute novice. I will have my ass handed to me everyday on multiple occasions.  Have you ever wanted to be told to format your computer? Uninstall Dota and Windows? This is your kinda game. 

Does it hurt? A bit, the mental scarring has lead to a sort of anaesthesia, brain-damage if you will. This is good, because you need to forget quickly; the losses, the team mate on team mate brutality, the ? and tips flying at you EVERY SINGLE GAME. Don't know what ? means, you'll find out and when you do you'll realise you're just as pathetic as me. A slave to your addiction, a pawn in Valve's schemes. Oh, you'll want to stop playing, you'll tell yourself you won't play ever again. But, you will, you'll dance to Valve's tune like a pathetic marionette. Eventually, you'll end up like me, bitter, twisted, brain-damaged. . .

Wait, what was I talking about? Time for another game of Dota.  

10/10 would recommend."

The game is near to unplayable due to the literal constant need to restart to update the client. It's honestly pathetic and sloppy coding.

Then you play for twenty and, though you still don't know what's going on, you have some great games and some awful ones, some highs and some lows. You sink more and more time into it until you hit a hundred hours, learning more about the game and more about how much you suck at it. But it's not enough. You want more. You're tired of trash teammates and annoying enemy picks but you push through. You keep playing. You watch some professional players and see how much better they are than you. You get invested and support teams in your region. Another hundred hours goes by. And they keep going by until you hit a thousand - and it's done. You've made it. You've conquered the hill that stood before you and you can now confidently say that you've achieved your goal for the past thousand hours. You are no longer in the dumpster and merely in the trash: it's time to start learning the game for real."

10562,"Probably the worst game I've ever played. Not because the game is bad. No no no. The game itself is quite in-depth and amazing. Unfortunately, even in casual games, you will get some of the most toxic teammates on the planet, who are feeding for no reason or telling you to kys. You WILL NEVER have fun with this game. More often than not, you'll be frustrated. Do NOT play this game unless you're playing with four others you know, or unless you're playing against bots. People who ruin games are constant and never ending. Each game will have someone toxic, someone who throws, or someone who makes it just difficult to play in general. This game could be so much fun if the community wasn't so horrible."

10589,"This game might be fun if it weren't for all the over-complex game-play, the smurf accounts, the stigma of playing it, the way matchmaking works, the community, the aesthetics of the game and the controls/key-binds. Oh wait, this game could never be fun in any capacity! This is a completely garbage game that is fueled by the mass hysteria that surrounds it just the Call of Duty crowd. It is incredibly complex, too much so, because to keep the hype going you have to continually add new things to the game because people can't leave well enough alone. If you were to try and understand how to play, good luck getting help from the community. They are some of the worst, all there is to it. Wanna try your luck in matchmaking 'cause you don't need no-one to teach you nuthin'? Well good luck there partner, the matchmaking will repetitively match you with someone who has hundreds, if not literal thousands, of hours more than you. Hypothetically, let's just say the matchmaking ""works as intended"" for once and you get matched with people leveled such as yourself and - GOTCHA! In my professional estimation, I would say roughly 50% of the people who are ""new"" players are actually veterans who get tired of the competition and just want to feel good about themselves. Smurfs. Finally, lets say you just want to try to fake some team-play and play in a match with bots........ Well in that case enjoy messing around with the atrocious key-binds until you have something of a control scheme worth playing with because the default one is almost unplayable, at least when playing against anyone who knows what they're doing (almost everyone as a reminder). Finally, after spending the last 5 hours and 41 minutes fiddling around with this 'game', you get to tell your other friends that you've been playing Dota 2 all day! Yea, don't play this thing."

10593,"It's me, U Thant. I have a clear definitive history of taking things in matter and making things more ""apparent"". For that fact and that fact alone, you can trust me. This game is a psychological experiment that tests your mentality and capability and last but not least, your commitment to a game that will give you pleasure and anger. You probably watch Ti and expect something greatness but no. No, arcane isn't LOL likewise, spectating something and playing the game yourself is a totally different circumstance. You will have to crawl through countless varieties of toxicity and grief, endure throw and smurfs. You ever heard of ""The great filter"", these kinds of things are not one time thing. They exist in every game, every rank, everyday in every universes with different possibilities. Once you are addicted to this game, you can't run away but you can ""hide"". But you will always ALWAYS come back to this game. That's why dota still exists and is dying at the same time."

10646,"Dota 2 is very fun game, especially if you're in SEA servers. At the start, if you chose to go unranked alone, well good luck, there is always a very talkative pinoy that will say ""bobo"" to you and will always compliment how good you are. Not only that, you will always [strike] lose [/strike] win if you have that kind of teammate."
10647,"Back then, my classmates and I would play CSGO and DOTA 1. We would battle each other out and make fun of mistakes and fails after the game. It was full of joy back then and we eventually became friends. But as more school works pile up, only some of us continued to play. We no longer do lobby battles since we were lacking members. We used to be 15, but only 5 are left. I can still remember the time that when we would play DOTA 2 all night. It was fun despite only some of us are actively playing. Did I mention that we would be together in real life? We played all night as seat mates on cafe's and that would make the occasion even special. And now, after we graduated last year, only I alone, is active. Fifteen to one real quick. It's kinda sad.. I mean, I can't blame them for not playing anymore. We're now adults. We now need to work in order to survive unlike when we were still students. Most of us now have jobs, others have families. It's quite sad and lonely but I guess I still have the gaming fire in me haha. Maybe that's the reason why I still play. Or maybe I just missed the old days. DOTA HITS DIFFERENT WHEN PLAYED WITH FRIENDS."

10652,"this game is like a drug, you play this to ignite your happiness. but once you got too consumed with it, it will eat your life surely away. 

and once you overdose yourself with losses, especially in ranked games. you will hate it and will never touch it.

now the question is, will you be ready on wasting time on this kind of drug? everything lays underneath your palms and fingers."
10653,"DOTA 2 is a remake of DOTA, which was a custom map on Blizzard's Warcraft 3.  Almost all of the heroes you can play are based on art models directly ripped off from Warcraft 3.  So you have ""game creators"" who really just took the character models of Warcraft 3 and map style of Warcraft 3 and make it a little higher resolution, then sell it as their own.  In theory the game is quite awesome, and can take awhile to actually learn if you are new.  To make items you must combine several other items and at times even buy recipes.  Unlike the original DOTA where someone on the time has to spend their precious gold to buy a courier (usually the ""support""), DOTA 2 gives everyone their own courier from the start, which seems to automatically upgrade itself during gameplay.  The heroes are beyond imbalanced.  Thus even with some 100 heroes to pick from, you will see the exact same heroes over and over.  These usually include Anti Mage, Pudge, Bounty Hunter, Drow, and Meepo.  The imbalance of this game is obvious, as you will think you are doing good at level 11 or so, only to realize the Meepo on the other team is level 25, and has a full inventory.  Many people also play the Troll, who can put his victim in an endless stun deadlock, and kill you while you cannot move, attack, use any abilities or items.  There are also observer wards that you may buy, but take a long time to re-stock.  These observer wards can be planted to remove the fog of war in an area and give everyone on a team vision of that area.  There are also sentry wards used to reveal invisible heroes such as Riki or Bounty Hunter.  If you are on a really bad team then no one wants to buy these, as you have to spend your precious gold on the wards instead of items.  There is a Tome of Experience that spawns every 5 minutes or so, but greedy allies usually buy it immediately, so good luck ever getting it.  The Matchmaking System is HORRIBLE, and can take over an hour to find a match.  Yes, I have actually sat waiting over an hour for a match and still not found one.  The ""devs"" or people who run this game have an insane banning system setup as well.  If you do the slightest thing wrong -- disconnect from a game, take too long to pick your hero, or even something as simple as write text to your allies such as, ""Let's defend here,"" you may get reported by all of the other players like they are vultures.  In fact, they could report you for being the best player and they are jealous of you, or for no reason at all.  Then you will be communication banned or placed in ""Low Priority Matches"" which are almost impossible to get out of.  The people who run this game are very biased on who they punish or don't.  All kinds of people who harass, troll, and such are never punished.  Meanwhile you will get sent to Low Priority because you got the most kills and everyone in the game, even the other players on your own team are jealous of you and all report you.  You can also buy skins or cosmetics for this game, and some of them cost over $100.  Yes that's right.  They charge outrageous prices for skins.  Can you imagine being communication banned endlessly, or sent to Low Priority over and over, and then wanting to buy 50$ or 100$ skins?  You'd have to be a masochist for that.  They also have a Battle Pass, which costs money as well, but I WOULD NEVER GIVE THESE PEOPLE A PENNY."

the system around matchmaking is so obtuse and complicated, the only reason they use it is because its always been that way.  the game itself is constantly being changed more than my casual ass can keep up with.  a lot of games can feel like you are just waiting for it to end.  many performance issues on my linux machine"

Every weekend, my friends and I would play the Saturday battlecup (we eventually got pretty good), and they are some of the best experiences of my life.  While this game is very hard to learn and impossible to truly master, the journey is worth it.  DotA is a lot like life.  You have an idea of what you want to do and a plan to get there, but things change and get in the way, and those times, the times things get in the way, are when you can express yourself and show who you are.  That is what happens in every game of DotA. Your plans don't go perfectly, but then you get to adapt and show off who you are through a game that anyone can enjoy.

10811,"As someone who's invested well over 160 hours into DOTA 2 (and yes, I'm aware that that is not a lot by the standards of many core players), I have to say that I'm truly discouraged.  I'm not discouraged by the gameplay - far from it.  Rather, it is the extreme toxicity of the playerbase that goes un-moderated that has made me consider leaving the game altogether.  

During my time with DOTA, I have been frequently told by other players to ""F*** off"" and other worse expletives while trying to cooperate in team style fashion.  Worse, I'm practically a baby compared to the other players that I am playing against in unranked (you have to play 100 hours of unranked before you can play ranked) and I fear trying new characters because I know that, inevitably, someone is going to cuss me out - either over a live mic or over chat - if I perform poorly.

At one point, I even had one player tell me to ""Go die.  Literally please go die of cancer or something awful.""  I'm really disheartened, because the game that I loved while playing ""New Player"" mode was quickly one that I grew to hate while playing unranked against players who are certainly better than me (and know so, and want to tell me so over and over again).

There will certainly be some who see this post and say, ""Well then you should just GET BETTER and then people will quit being rude to you.""  

I disagree wholeheartedly.  I think there are two solutions to fixing this problem of utter toxicity, verbal abuse, and beratement.  

1) Valve needs to ban players (at least for a period) when they are nasty towards other players.
2) More importantly, ""ranked"" play should be available instantaneously.  This AT LEAST ensures that a player that is newer is playing in some sort of hierarchy that likely matches their skill level.  Ranked play should be based on role type (support vs. carry) and/or character chosen.  This would give older players the versatility to try new characters without having to try them out on professional level players.

Valve, do something about the toxicity and I will gladly come back.  You've got a great game, and I'm sure that there are some great community members out there, but my experience as a new player has been downright shameful and has literally made me throw in the towel.  I may be one person, and some may argue that I take offense too easily, but I don't think so.  I think you've got a serious business problem here that will cause new players to turn away from the game quickly if you don't take serious action."

Genreally prefer Dota to leauge. i started with dota and when my friends moved to leauge i tagged along for a bit but it didn't feel right. Leauge isn't terrible it's just a different game but Dota, Dota plays wierd. 

Dota in my mind is about learning the game. Learning how all the abilities and items work together. Where to be what to do. When a fight actually happens everything is a mess. It's about all those things that go down before the fight that decide what happens you know.

It's so asymmetrical. and i love that about doata."

10824,"Valve is lazy.  If you are an American, there are better MOBAs that actually make it fun to play with others.  I have played this on and off for 10 years, recently giving it another try. 

Here are the basic issues:

- Valve tried to make people choose support with their new system.  Well their system doesn't work.
- End game MVP system is arbitrary.  You could carry your team as support.  Guess what, a dumb simple carry like drow or sniper will get the MVP over you.
- If you queue in on English speaking servers, you won't get English speakers
- If you play with a terrible player, you used to be able to vote end with no penalty.  Now you have to waste your time.  This made it way worse as you waste hours here and there.
- If a player throws the game, its still considered a loss.  Pretty easy to not penalize team players by not giving them the loss and filter out bad actors Valve, but you don't.
- Characters are still unbalanced, go check the win loss rates of the noob heroes and you will see.

I had a game with 43 kill assists as Treant that went an hour.  One player threw it at that point by not using their hero.  Another just ran the whole game to get as low death count as possible to the detriment of the team.  These aren't exceptions.  They are archetypes.  So enjoy your 2 v 4, 3 v 5, 4 v 2, etc. variations of what should be a 5 v 5 game.  Those rare 5 v 5 games were why I played and came back but after playing again I realized they were about 1 in 30.  Thats 20ish hours to have one fun hour while wading through the dregs of humanity."

10871,The Game of my life
10872,"So i have played so far on this steam 1633 hours by this minute and on my other steam account which i lost or somehow cannot access had like about 700 to 1000 hours so i'll say mainly 2K + hours played on this game and don't get me wrong i love it since i started playing it it has anything you would like to have as a moba game , probably the best designed one by this minute so far. It becomes even more fun when you start buying so pay money for play and you get to buy avatars such as dress,weapon,hats ,taunts etc you got some special effects on them and it becomes clearly more desired to play.
It does as a variety of heroes such as Agility , Inteligence and Strenght as many of you already probably know so it looks well and is a nice gameplay . But after all this hours that i played this game and that goes for like 3-4 years now and i always meet this problem in game the MATCHMAKING , the way they set up your opponents and your teammates. So to explain a bit better is a 5v5 MOBA game which everyone at the start of the game they do choose an hero which from the entire list of heroes every single of them has different skills and abilities and also different positions on the map , such as Mid lane ,Off lane or Safe Lane of course that you can try play it on any of these lanes but some of them they are just meant for those positions and if you player or will play  this game you will know what i mean when you will experience what i have just said. For the entire period of my time that i played this game i just kept concentrated on SOLO Ranked MMR games which is a type of climb the ladder game , you start from a lowest skill and as you play more and gain skill and experience you will upgrade your rank level by winning games. At least that what this matchmaking supposed to mean. That is my main point playing this game , of course it has other different styles of play or mods of play but mainly i choose this as i like ranked type games ,climbing the ladder become better. You will not be able to play ranked when u just first started dota they wont allow it of the fact that the dota makers may know that you dont have enough experience and you could ruin the game for others which it may sound so interesting and good at begining for some not for others. Can't really remember the way you reach to play ranked but if i do remember well is something of 100 Matches . Can't remember if you need 100Matches win or just 100 Matches play. Anyway so far so good. Once you started Ranked games you will have to Start from Herald Division and climb your way up to Immortal . Know i this see this thing from day 1 i started play dota and nothing has changed , the Matchmaking is brutally F*****. It doesn't even makes sense from my opinion why the HERALD bracket his just so stopping you from advaning in skill grade no matter how good you become with time. It's just because no matter how much you will try to improve you won't be able to pass this bracket for as long as you play by yourself and not with other 2-3-4 friends wich they have the knowledge of the heroes skills and items also abilities .And that's the funny part it's supposed to be Solo MMR Ranked . Getting back to matchmaking is so bad / SHIT the way makes up the teams. Most of the times you will just have players in your team starting at herald 1 that they will just feed , they will not understand the point of the game the fact of last hits and denies of the creep and how much you actually need gold and items into this games and thats okay i mean is a free to play game so may encounter all type of players some of them low minded some of them extremly highed minded. But as dota made this it all has to come up to the right bracket , right ? Beh dear players it doesn't. If for example you feel like you want to improve in this game and become better and you may take some coaching watch some dota games also check youtube for how to improve as i have seen it is so much content take it's helpfull , for real . It wont help your matchmaking though no matter what you will do. I mean i'm playing know like for the last 3 months only dota and is just doesn't happen for me . No matter which position i play no mather what i do and most of the games am just the biggest impact of the game , doesnt even matter which position i play it still dont work because is meant to be a 5 players team game that if one starts f up for a bit it could just brutally change the entire game so fast and that's what i want to say the matchmaking of dota it will give you in your team some teammates that i dont blame but i just dont feel its their skill yet there to be and is only herald 2 or 3 that i am speaking as i'm struggling to reach crusader at this minute , anyways that they arent supposed to be in your team and not because me i am such a impressive good player is because the enemy team has 4 or maybe all 5 of them that they really know what they are doing like they have the chemistry so level up and that inflicts the game .even in 15 minutes thats it . And that's what i keep encountering the same type of games over and over and over . And you may report as much as you want the players for feeding ,bad play ,griefing it will only get worse for you. Somehow dota for every report you will do it wil give 100% + more worst games then that . I tried to avoid players i think i did avoid about 100 in 2 months time , so that maybe that matchmaking will understand that i'm trying to play different type of players , better players , No . Not at all. It may consolidate you for sometimes you win 5-6 games in a row and you say oh this is so good i'm getting such good players in my team and everything works wonderfull and w0w but then you realise that in the other team they are 2 of those players you have in your team when you lose and you realised someone in the other team is not having fun because someone doesn't play the game right and it ruins it . Also you will meet smurfers too and it happens mostly in this HERALD Bracket people with 150-200 games just coming at ranked and smashing About getting a score 30 - 0 , you know it's obvious but is not fair for others and not because they are noobs or stupid its just because that guy has a certain point of experience which allows him to do things to those players that they are just at begining experiencing the game. Maybe many of you will say that i don't know to loose or things like that but is just not that , i don't mind loosing at all but when it is a fair game like when they have been better outplayed as or anything not when ur teammates just screw up because they don't know what they are playing and because of the matchmaking and this happens for so long that i cannot possibly believe its just me having this problem which from my point of view its just got out of rage , like you look at the time you spend on such a game expecting that improvent that seems it won't game as the creators they don't really give a F about you which it sad . I'm telling to everybody which they may be just starting or want to start play this game , at the begining it will be such a great game you won't care about losing and winning , you can't you will start experience the game which is a nice wave you will be going thru but then after you will learn it , you will learn to play some heroes about 3-4 months ill say .. knowing your strategy your style and items and you will meet the issues i just explained or tried to explain , hope i have done good enough for you to understand and you will realise that is not about that you lost the game is about the way you lost it ,it wont make sense to lose from 30m to 1h for the mistakes of the matchmaking and this is just keeping for way to long . I remember same used to be in CS.GO years ago with the prime everybody was trying to reach Global Elite and but was that time when everybody was using this cheats and you will be finding youself in the team that you could not control"

The community that plays this game is toxic and chances are you will become toxic too. Only instal this or attempt to play if you hate yourself and enjoy suffering in your precious free time. The match making system is terrible, game mechanics are terrrible, Items, terrible character design is awful. The skill the ballance all of it is bad. Any redeming qualities this game has it totally 100% outweighed by the absolutely awful, awful matchmaking experience you will have and that you will enevitable give to others. SUPER SUPER punishing and toxic to new players. The existing community honestly would rather people never installed or attemped to learn how to play dota with the way in game reporting works. You will be punished, your games witll be greifed you will experience psychological torment like you have never seen in a game before. I honestly reccomend joining the cult of scientology or some other abusive social power structure over installing and attempting to play this terribly unfun game. Please spare yourself the wasted time. WOULD NOT RECCOMEND. Hardened violent criminals should have to play this game as a form of punishment it is that bad. PS I payed for this game back with it was open beta and heavily hyped. I regret having ever installed this. I regret any time i spent learning or playing the game I regret it all I hate whoever developed this game and I wish them suffering upon suffering and curses upon curses.

11094,STUPID MATCH MAKING
11095,this game will suck you in and you`ll get really good at it and it`ll place you in a rank and you have the option to buy some minimal changes - this suck - that`s not a scenario that in any way gives something to embrace a place in the game. Also this game is more about addicted persons and how the game can manage the healing process for persons that are staying for anything more than 6 hours daily in game - are representing not even the worst side. you can definetly monetize more by helping those poor people who and when they are lost in a desperate pool of running from what they are feeling and dealing with in reality

11125,"In all of my hours of Dota I've wondered why I play the game.
To conclude this thaught I have decided to post this review based on my personal experience and that which I have seen from several friends playing the game.

So lets get real, for your average player this game will be a no brainer, spells items etc learn and move but for the new bloods I would recomend to learn as much as possible and practice with several different heroes as you progress on your journey with Dota 2.The game will get challenging and will almost always push you past your limits to always improve, from easy teamfights to massive strats, this game will require you to teach yourself how each of these heroes work individually and how they work in a team, the game is completely team driven which means if one messes up the others will have to reap which he/her has sown.

The game will seem hard at first to most and over complicated, I can promise you that, but don't lose hope cause in the end you will grow a liking to it.

From broken mechanics and strats to playing with both insanely good and immensly new players you will always have to work out a way to play with the team.

All out enjoy.
And have a great day further gamers.Hope this helped."

11137,"Hello ! My name is Jason and I almost have 3.2k hours in this game omg ... (3183 hours played ) . I am gonna share my experience of myself playing this game . Please enjoy ^^

This is one of the best games I've ever played so far . The complexity of this game is definitely at the top ... From all different kinds of heroes to all different kinds of mechanics are in the game . The best MOBA in my opinion . The unlimited amount of things that you can do in this game with the right team of heroes and players is mesmerizing . I used to play this game casually ever since i was a small boy  but i only started playing this game seriously since last year ( 2021 ) due to Covid arising . i used to spam unrank with my friends and cousins when one day  i decided to try rank for the first time . And just the pure feeling of happiness when i ranked up was extra ordinary and i could not stop . i used to practice and play ranks in the mornings and play unrank with my cousins during the night . i started to get a lot better in this game . i ranked up from uncalibrated  to crusader during my early ranking up phase . 

i got stuck at crusader for a while as my school reopened and i quit playing for a few months . When my school ended i started playing again and i started spamming rank games . i watched youtube videos ( bsj , proguides etc ) , pro games to improve and be a better player . i had promised myself to at least reach legend rank . all of my grind worked as i ranked up to archon . And that was huge for me because for me at that time , archons were really good players . i was stuck at archon for a while again ... half of it was cause i still had room to improve and other half was cuz my school restarted again ... but this time i did not stop playing , instead i played less but i did play . i was improving , i could feel it but something was missing . i was not playing to improve rather i was playing to gain mmr .

 This playstyle got me to archon 5 but yep another rank up block . after a few weeks , my school closed and i started playing this game from morning to night . i had around 51 - 52 % win rate but this was hurting my health both physically and mentally . After all the grind i had one more win required to reach legend . My ultimate goal for dota , when i immediately lost 10 games in a row ... yes 10 .

 i got so mad after it , that i even uninstalled my game . i took a break for a month . when i came back , i promised myself to not care about mmr and only play to improve and after that i started winning like crazy ... its actually insane . my win rate rose up to 65% and i started to understand the game in more depth . i reached legend and kept playing when one time i even hit a 10-win streak taking me to legend 4 . I was really happy but after playing all morning and night for a while  ,

 i realised that all of this is not worth it . This is a great game and since it is a great game , it is also really addicting . I ranked up from the beginning to legend 4 without any recalibaration and i am really happy about it but the thing is , legend 4 is still not a high rank . its average at best in my opinion . I can keep playing and playing this game and rank up to divine but its still not worth it . Lets say hypothetically i even reach immortal playing this game .

 Then what? its still not worth it . yes i will be happy that i reached immortal but even immortal is average in my opinion . The only good 'rank' that i can see are Rank 200 - 1 Immortals . Only when u reach around that rank , its worth it . cause around this rank , you may have a chance to be selected to a pro team ( div 1 or 2 ) which is also very unlikely .. 

Even if you are selected to a team , its not guaranteed that bills will be paid . In order to earn money you have to win and winning is very hard at that level , because everyone is so good already and it also depends on luck . Lets say enemy gets a dd or rosh spawns just in team you lose a team fight , stuff like that ... I realised all of this and yea i have decided to quit playing this game .

 Im already a grown ass man . i turned 17 this year and i have to be serious about my future . if i was insanely good at this game then i would keep playing this game but even though i love this game , i also have to look at myself realistically . It was a fun journey for me .

 One whole year of serious Dota . Solo Adventure and Fun Time with friends and cousins . What a journey for me honestly .. However , One thing i am happy about is i did complete my promise of reaching legend from uncalibrated . i am currently legend 4 and not gonna lie i am happy . Even though its average at best but its a long way for me . Long way where i started from . Now i have to focus on my future , got dreams and a bag to chase . One day when i will finally  accomplish  my dreams , i will come back again and write about it . But till then goodbye Dota .

Some advice that i would like to give to others playing this game or wanting to start this game .
1. Always be kind to others and yourself . This game is really fun but can be really stressful at times as it requires alot of thinking and communication . And some people are just generally toxic and weird ..
but i would suggest to always be chill and if there are some people annoying you , instead of talking to them . simply mute them and focus on how YOU can play the best . Thats the best advice i can give .
Do not ruin games for others and do not let others ruin your game by annoying u , simply mute them :)

2. Watch videos on how to improve on youtube . You can just play this game casually but its never wrong to want to improve . I suggest watching BSJ , Proguides , Gamerzclass , You may also watch some pro games to learn how they play.

3. Never be afraid to take risks . Dont always make the same items or play with the same playstyle or go the same build every game . Try new things , try unique builds etc . 

4 Most improtant advice - TAKE CARE OF YOUR HEALTH !
Stretch after games , during draft - drink alot of water during games , excercise in the morning and evening . and make sure to eat your food . 
Do not neglect these things or u gonna face pain in the future ma boyyyy
.
.
Alright thats all i have to say .
Thank you for reading . Good luck with your jouney :)"

11252,"DOTA 2 is not bad game, it's just not for everyone.
Like with every competitive online game, the game is not fun to play if you don't meet high skill requirements.
If you are new or casual player, you will often be placed in team with significantly more skilled players that might be able to carry you despite your lack of skills and obviously they will not be happy about that.
You will feel bad for ruining the game for your team because you were not good enough and it will be more and more difficult for you to enjoy the game.

It was fun to play at the very beginning and I liked the game, however once I've moved from new player mode to unranked play, majority of the battles were poorly matched, too stressful to play and even though I had few good battles, it's difficult to feel happy about one match where I made good contribution to the team when the number of battles where I was outmatched is significantly higher.

I can't recommend the game unless you are very good at MOBA or you don't mind playing only practice mode vs bots."

11466,"For real. It takes way too much time to get into this game - its not worth it.
The graphics suck, the gameplay is confusing and sometimes you are stuck in matches that take more than an hour without being able to surrender or end your suffering."
11467,It's fun
11468,More than a game

11470,This games is hard but at the same time makes you feel like you want to play it over and over even if you lose every game.
11471,"Well to be frank ! Playing since 2010. already addicted to it till today !  best game ever made if one knows how to play.
Only one drawback at first i could run the game in my old PC perfectly , but today i need to buy new PC for it of high end configurization .But it is totally worth it !  Best game ever made !"

11473,"The matchmaking is dogshit. It will pair you against people far outside your skill level, and there's no way to surrender. Leaving early penalizes you. Games are anywhere from thirty to fifty minutes. You will lose.

Your teammates are dogshit. They speak russian or portuguese and will flame you if you make a single mistake, and then spam ping you as fast as they can click on their shitty 258 kb internet connection until you mute them.

After you mute them, they will teleport to your lane and try to gank. But that gank is not actually a gank, it's feeding the enemy team in disguise to make your lane have a massive disadvantage as well. They will ping you for this too.

The enemy team will be constantly spamming voice emotes after every kill, even though the score is three to forty two. If you complain in chat, they will make fun of you. If you try to make a play and die for it, they will tip you to mock you.

If you try to farm your jungle, it will have fifteen observer wards and thirty two sentries. Don't ask how this is possible, the enemy team only speaks russian anyway. Your team has 4 observers and 10 sentries stocked in shop because you have five carries and nobody wants to buy them.

If you try to farm lane, you will get hit with a rod of atos into a stun into a stun into a stun into a stun into a stun into a stun into a stun into a stun into a stun into a stun into a stun into a stun, and you will die. Somewhere along the line you got hit with Bounty Hunter's track ability, so you give more gold to the enemy team. Your jungle Legion Commander spam pings you for this.

At twenty two minutes, your team has no more low ground towers. You sit in your highground while the enemy farms the entire jungle and gets six slotted, while you clutch your shadow blade and two wraith bands and pray to a god that isn't listening they don't get Roshan. Despite a ward catching them going into Roshan, your support Nyx Assassin who only has tranquils and a dagon 2 scans Roshan, and then spam pings it. When the enemy Wraith King gets the aegis, Nyx dies to him trying to pop it. He does 20% of his health. He also doesn't press mana burn. He spam pings you for this.

They finally siege your high ground, and you get two kills. They have to back off because they dove your fountain and you can finally buy your farming item: Maelstrom. You walk into mid, push a tier one, and they all buy back. In the time it takes you to turn around because Dota has such slow turning, you get hit by three stuns, a Lion ult, a Lina ult, and then get spam pinged by your off lane Anti Mage who has a ring of health and a quelling blade.

You have buyback. You press it to try and play the game. The enemy Phantom Assassin dives fountain and kills you in one hit. The enemy team sits around and waits for their mega creeps that they spent the last 10 minutes hitting barracks for to end while they spam voice emotes and taunts. Your Ancient explodes after you respawn and die one last time. The final score is 10 to 82. You have six kills. Your team blames you in broken english for feeding.

You queue up again."

11602,"This isn't me. Every time I log onto my pc I see another few hours spent in this game. ""why you playing dota"" ""caught in 4k"" my friends say. I have no control here. Through god knows what virus this shitty League of Legends ripoff has wormed its way into my steam library and has been playing itself ever since. What a sick joke. They could've just hijacked my computer and ransomed my files, or turned it into a remote bitcoin miner, or some godforsaken proxy for Nigerian scam-mongerers. Instead, they do this. Degrade me and ruin what little sanity I have left. I have to live with this. 86 hours spent playing DOTA 2. That will never go away. A permanent blot on my reputation as a human being. Nothing will ever make this better. Its driving me mad. I cant sleep at night any more. I toss and turn in a paranoid agony with the thought that tomorrow I will wake up and my playtime will be even longer. I've started sleepwalking, waking up in strange places with no recollection of how I got there. Sometimes when it gets quiet I can almost hear whispers ""just install it"" ""give it a go"" ""how bad could it be?"". Maybe I'm just hearing things, but with each day - and every new unaccounted hour logged into this game, the voices get louder. This game is an abomination and will haunt me for the rest of my life. Pray for me, I'm already dead."

11686,"I am a 45 yo father, probably one of the oldest people playing this game. I am a single father to my Son, who is 14 now. My son got this game for Christmas in 2021 from his uncle, so we installed it on his computer and he started playing. By the end of the week he had 24 hours on this game. This was horrible for me, as it was already hard for me to find ways to spend time with my son, as he is always out with his friends or just watching YouTube. So i decided to make a Steam account and get this game to see if I could maybe play alongside him. I loaded into the game, picked my character and world and started playing but I was stuck on what you where supposed to do. I asked my Son for help and he hosted a game for me to join. I loved it as it was the best time I had spent with my Son since my wife had died. This game has ever since brought me and my son closer again and now we actually spend time together outside the house together as well. This game reminded me that there's fun to be had in everything, and it has brought both me and my Son many happy memories."

11723,Dota 2 is a free to play moba that is fun. At first you will have a hard time and lose a lot of games at first. But as you watch videos and play more games you'll become better. It's very fun and worth your time. Important: Take breaks!

11734,"Dont install this It will make you want to kill yourself. It will turn you into a mysanthropic, racist, generally unhappy person. The community that plays this game is toxic and chances are you will become toxic too. Only instal this or attempt to play if you hate yourself and enjoy suffering in your precious free time. The match making system is terrible, game mechanics are terrrible, Items, terrible character design is awful. The skill the ballance all of it is bad. Any redeming qualities this game has it totally 100% outweighed by the absolutely awful, awful matchmaking experience you will have and that you will enevitable give to others. SUPER SUPER punishing and toxic to new players. The existing community honestly would rather people never installed or attemped to learn how to play dota with the way in game reporting works. You will be punished, your games witll be greifed you will experience psychological torment like you have never seen in a game before. I honestly reccomend joining the cult of scientology or some other abusive social power structure over installing and attempting to play this terribly unfun game. Please spare yourself the wasted time. WOULD NOT RECCOMEND. Hardened violent criminals should have to play this game as a form of punishment it is that bad. PS I payed for this game back with it was open beta and heavily hyped. I regret having ever installed this. I regret any time i spent learning or playing the game I regret it all I hate whoever developed this game and I wish them suffering upon suffering and curses upon curses.

None mine but speaks for everyone

I have 0 clue how can a respectable game developer allow this to happen. Not just public games, but tournament also lmao. So it seems I was wrong thinking this game was created by a respectable developer."

Not very cool if you are on a limited bandwidth connection. 

The game has more than quadrupled in size since release, yet there are at most 30 new heroes in the game which certainly shouldn't add up to 30gb of extra space."

The community that plays this game is toxic and chances are you will become toxic too. Only instal this or attempt to play if you hate yourself and enjoy suffering in your precious free time. The match making system is terrible, game mechanics are terrrible, Items, terrible character design is awful. The skill the ballance all of it is bad. Any redeming qualities this game has it totally 100% outweighed by the absolutely awful, awful matchmaking experience you will have and that you will enevitable give to others. SUPER SUPER punishing and toxic to new players. The existing community honestly would rather people never installed or attemped to learn how to play dota with the way in game reporting works. You will be punished, your games witll be greifed you will experience psychological torment like you have never seen in a game before. I honestly reccomend joining the cult of scientology or some other abusive social power structure over installing and attempting to play this terribly unfun game. Please spare yourself the wasted time. WOULD NOT RECCOMEND. Hardened violent criminals should have to play this game as a form of punishment it is that bad. PS I payed for this game back with it was open beta and heavily hyped. I regret having ever installed this. I regret any time i spent learning or playing the game I regret it all I hate whoever developed this game and I wish them suffering upon suffering and curses upon curses.

11818,"According to all known laws of aviation, there is no way a bee should be able to fly. Its wings are too small to get its fat little body off the ground. The bee, of course, flies anyway because bees don't care what humans think is impossible. Yellow, black. Yellow, black. Yellow, black. Yellow, black. Ooh, black and yellow! Let's shake it up a little. Barry! Breakfast is ready! Ooming! Hang on a second. Hello? - Barry? - Adam? - Oan you believe this is happening? - I can't. I'll pick you up. Looking sharp. Use the stairs. Your father paid good money for those. Sorry. I'm excited. Here's the graduate. We're very proud of you, son. A perfect report card, all B's. Very proud. Ma! I got a thing going here. - You got lint on your fuzz. - Ow! That's me! - Wave to us! We'll be in row 118,000. - Bye! Barry, I told you, stop flying in the house! - Hey, Adam. - Hey, Barry. - Is that fuzz gel? - A little. Special day, graduation. Never thought I'd make it. Three days grade school, three days high school. Those were awkward. Three days college. I'm glad I took a day and hitchhiked around the hive. You did come back different. - Hi, Barry. - Artie, growing a mustache? Looks good. - Hear about Frankie? - Yeah. - You going to the funeral? - No, I'm not going. Everybody knows, sting someone, you die. Don't waste it on a squirrel. Such a hothead. I guess he could have just gotten out of the way. I love this incorporating an amusement park into our day. That's why we don't need vacations. Boy, quite a bit of pomp... under the circumstances. - Well, Adam, today we are men. - We are! - Bee-men. - Amen! Hallelujah! Students, faculty, distinguished bees, please welcome Dean Buzzwell. Welcome, New Hive Oity graduating class of... ...9:15. That concludes our ceremonies. And begins your career at Honex Industries! Will we pick ourjob today? I heard it's just orientation. Heads up! Here we go. Keep your hands and antennas inside the tram at all times. - Wonder what it'll be like? - A little scary. Welcome to Honex, a division of Honesco and a part of the Hexagon Group. This is it! Wow. Wow. We know that you, as a bee, have worked your whole life to get to the point where you can work for your whole life. Honey begins when our valiant Pollen Jocks bring the nectar to the hive. Our top-secret formula is automatically color-corrected, scent-adjusted and bubble-contoured into this soothing sweet syrup with its distinctive golden glow you know as... Honey! - That girl was hot. - She's my cousin! - She is? - Yes, we're all cousins. - Right. You're right. - At Honex, we constantly strive to improve every aspect of bee existence. These bees are stress-testing a new helmet technology. - What do you think he makes? - Not enough. Here we have our latest advancement, the Krelman. - What does that do? - Oatches that little strand of honey that hangs after you pour it. Saves us millions. Oan anyone work on the Krelman? Of course. Most bee jobs are small ones. But bees know that every small job, if it's done well, means a lot. But choose carefully because you'll stay in the job you pick for the rest of your life. The same job the rest of your life? I didn't know that. What's the difference? You'll be happy to know that bees, as a species, haven't had one day off in 27 million years. So you'll just work us to death? We'll sure try. Wow! That blew my mind! ""What's the difference?"" How can you say that? One job forever? That's an insane choice to have to make. I'm relieved. Now we only have to make one decision in life. But, Adam, how could they never have told us that? Why would you question anything? We're bees. We're the most perfectly functioning society on Earth. You ever think maybe things work a little too well here? Like what? Give me one example. I don't know. But you know what I'm talking about. Please clear the gate. Royal Nectar Force on approach. Wait a second. Oheck it out. - Hey, those are Pollen Jocks! - Wow. I've never seen them this close. They know what it's like outside the hive. Yeah, but some don't come back. - Hey, Jocks! - Hi, Jocks! You guys did great! You're monsters! You're sky freaks! I love it! I love it! - I wonder where they were. - I don't know. Their day's not planned. Outside the hive, flying who knows where, doing who knows what. You can'tjust decide to be a Pollen Jock. You have to be bred for that. Right. Look. That's more pollen than you and I will see in a lifetime. It's just a status symbol. Bees make too much of it. Perhaps. Unless you're wearing it and the ladies see you wearing it. Those ladies? Aren't they our cousins too? Distant. Distant. Look at these two. - Oouple of Hive Harrys. - Let's have fun with them. It must be dangerous being a Pollen Jock. Yeah. Once a bear pinned me against a mushroom! He had a paw on my throat, and with the other, he was slapping me! - Oh, my! - I never thought I'd knock him out. What were you doing during this? Trying to alert the authorities. I can autograph that. A little gusty out there today, wasn't it, comrades? Yeah. Gusty. We're hitting a sunflower patch six miles from here tomorrow. - Six miles, huh? - Barry! A puddle jump for us, but maybe you're not up for it. - Maybe I am. - You are not! We're going 0900 at J-Gate. What do you think, buzzy-boy? Are you bee enough? I might be. It all depends on what 0900 means. Hey, Honex! Dad, you surprised me. You decide what you're interested in? - Well, there's a lot of choices. - But you only get one. Do you ever get bored doing the same job every day? Son, let me tell you about stirring. You grab that stick, and you just move it around, and you stir it around. You get yourself into a rhythm. It's a beautiful thing. You know, Dad, the more I think about it, maybe the honey field just isn't right for me. You were thinking of what, making balloon animals? That's a bad job for a guy with a stinger. Janet, your son's not sure he wants to go into honey! - Barry, you are so funny sometimes. - I'm not trying to be funny. You're not funny! You're going into honey. Our son, the stirrer! - You're gonna be a stirrer? - No one's listening to me! Wait till you see the sticks I have. I could say anything right now. I'm gonna get an ant tattoo! Let's open some honey and celebrate! Maybe I'll pierce my thorax. Shave my antennae. Shack up with a grasshopper. Get a gold tooth and call everybody ""dawg""! I'm so proud. - We're starting work today! - Today's the day. Oome on! All the good jobs will be gone. Yeah, right. Pollen counting, stunt bee, pouring, stirrer, front desk, hair removal... - Is it still available? - Hang on. Two left! One of them's yours! Oongratulations! Step to the side. - What'd you get? - Picking crud out. Stellar! Wow! Oouple of newbies? Yes, sir! Our first day! We are ready! Make your choice. - You want to go first? - No, you go. Oh, my. What's available? Restroom attendant's open, not for the reason you think. - Any chance of getting the Krelman? - Sure, you're on. I'm sorry, the Krelman just closed out. Wax monkey's always open. The Krelman opened up again. What happened? A bee died. Makes an opening. See? He's dead. Another dead one. Deady. Deadified. Two more dead. Dead from the neck up. Dead from the neck down. That's life! Oh, this is so hard! Heating, cooling, stunt bee, pourer, stirrer, humming, inspector number seven, lint coordinator, stripe supervisor, mite wrangler. Barry, what do you think I should... Barry? Barry! All right, we've got the sunflower patch in quadrant nine... What happened to you? Where are you? - I'm going out. - Out? Out where? - Out there. - Oh, no! I have to, before I go to work for the rest of my life. You're gonna die! You're crazy! Hello? Another call coming in. If anyone's feeling brave, there's a Korean deli on 83rd that gets their roses today. Hey, guys. - Look at that. - Isn't that the kid we saw yesterday? Hold it, son, flight deck's restricted. It's OK, Lou. We're gonna take him up. Really? Feeling lucky, are you?"

11821,Why do you need a BKB to not be stunned for 16 seconds in this game?  Why is it impossible to play an AP hero because you are silenced for the duration of your lifespan in the mid to late game?  Why is there no surrender vote when someone inevitably leaves in 2 minutes every single match that isn't ranked? Please reduce CC's and add surrender vote.... Then it will almost be as good as league.

11852,"As Someone who studied this game in his early college years, I am proud to say I put in work learning a couple of characters. That being said, ""THIS GAME IS NOT FOR EVERYONE."" If you're a casual gamer that likes shoot 'em ups and easy progression, you may be better off with another MOBA because this one is the godfather of them all. Not only does it require your basic understanding of how to play these types of games, but each character is so unique that you'll end up reading guides and watching youtube videos just to get considered ""decent"" on your favorite hero. Take for instance my example, out of the almost 500 hours I put into this game, about 400 playable hours was focused on Bounty Hunter. During my peak, I would end the average game with about a 5:1 K/D which isn't bad but isn't top tier either. Seems like quality > quantity right? However, I promise you that if you aren't studying this game, you're going to end up getting called trash in the comments. Take it from me, DOTA 2 is insanely fun, but requires a ton of dedication."

EDIT:

After further reviewing this game i guess what's going on is that matchmaking algo is thinking that I am smurfing when I'm not and it is matching me with other smurf. so then I get stomped, and then it's going to think I'm not a smurf and it will match me with the same bracket and I stomped them. it's a dumb algo. anyways I'm done with this game."

I've lost count of the number of times I've laughed myself to tears because of some random gimmick in the game or a comment by another friendly player.  Though not everyone in Dota is welcoming or nice, there are plenty of kind and friendly players, and with constant updates and gameplay adjustments, the game has endless ways to play and enjoy."

11958,"One of the most classical strategy game. Concept of the game is brilliant, heros with different abilities, items etc. categorisation of heros is good, like support, carry, hard carry. Plus their updates helps you to explore more and understand the game. TI TOURNAMENT is not less than a world cup, if you love dota then you‚Äôll love to watch the TI too."

11969,Don't destroy your peaceful life with this game
11970,"Matchmaking still doesn't work properly, nor does it take in consideration your rank (which is always locked to your account no matter the reset/calibration/recalibration, so doesnt matter either way), or your playtime. Pubs are getting worse with each day, and will never prolly get better. Reporting system is bad, and they are not implementing new ways of the system, but just ""patch"" the current one by changing up the naming convention.

Without the ""vote to kick player"" or ""vote to concede""  features implemented in all matches (not just tournaments) the game is just pure grief mode.


RIP Dota."

12033,just watch Free To Play and you will understand
12034,"I used to have a lot of fun with Dota 2, and while I think Dota is a great game at high-levels of play, I cannot recommend it to players because the matchmaking suffers from the same problem as every other team-based game; you are at the complete mercy of your team and any player who throws. Everyone's ranked journey begins at low MMR; but at low MMR, every game is decided from the actions of a troll: a win is achieved when there is a troll on the enemy team, and a loss is achieved when a troll is on your team. Of course, this is not always the case, but the average player will have the average game decided by a troll the majority of the time."
12035,The mechanic of the game and its complexity makes it unique.

12365,Newest update made the game unplayable for me. Has a 1-2 sec delay on all movement and spells. I highly doubt Valve will fix it so after 7 years of playing this game it looks like I'm finally done with it. I hope your company crashes and burns Valve. Terrible company the continues to make dota worse with each update.

12512,very high learning curve but worth it. if you dont like your life and have insecure feelings then this is the place to be. the game makes it easy to blame your teammates for your own shortcomings. as long as you say that mmr is rigged you can be a highly superior and highly intelligent individual in this game. if that is not your cup of tea you can also play with a friend group to have a more healthy engagement with this game.

12739,"Never have I seen a more dynamic strategy game. You CANNOT go into a game with a fully premeditated strategy and expect to execute it flawlessly: While there is a lot you can predetermine based on the heroes involved in the match there is far too much that is based on how your allies and enemies play that will force you to change your plan as you go.

Every Hero also feels strangely unique despite usually sharing a few mechanics with other heroes. Honestly a really well designed game where you have never really lost the game (Unless your team is horribly discoordinated which definitely does happen) and every hero is perfectly viable (Although some are much harder to use than others and are often not worth using if you're concerned with efficiency)."
12740,"fun 3-5% of the time

12741,"i just faced my first cheater in the game(god only knows how many went unnoticed), a scripter nonetheless the match id is 6605156120  his steam ID is : 924135369  he was playing ARC WARDEN.

this is unfair, this is pathetic, shame on the valve and Dota 2 developers for not addressing this issue. I only realized this after someone in the game mentioned this to me, the fact that he has seen this type of stuff before, i personally had no idea this was even possible to do, now i know better, even Dota 2 to with all it's might is incapable of handling cheaters. this individual in question already has a VAC BAN but they are still able to play Dota 2 freely, which renders the entire VAC BAN idea pointless and ineffective, if someone has cheated and therefore banned, they SHOULD remain banned from that game, giving cheater the benefit of the doubt only harms people like me who play Dota 2 fairly. again this is so pathetic and disgusting both from the cheater and from the developers for failing to address the problem. VAC BANS are useless in their current state, you might aswell not ban at all because there is no difference between the two."
12742,"The game is fun but:
Not recommended due to toxicity community and nerves problems

12743,"This is a great game, however, don't step out of the comfort zone of new player games unless you know you will do really well. Otherwise you get reported by other players and banned. Dota are not interested in what reason, they ignore you if you contact them."

12770,"I love Dota 2, but I could never recommend this game for new players. The community is filled with some of the most toxic people imaginable. And the sad fact is, this game stopped being fun years ago. The people cling onto it because of the memorizes and good times they've had on this game but never seem to enjoy it the way they used to. 

Since you have such older, veteran players, new players are criticized, ridiculed, and thrown several racial slurs. And because theses veteran players keep coming back instead of moving on, they act pompous and almost as if they have some form of seniority in the game (which they do) and can't take any form of criticism. Rub someone the wrong way and that person will go out of their way for the next 30 mins to an hour just to antagonize others.

I highly do not recommend this game to new players. I don't care if you like the Netflix Dota Dragonsblood, go watch Arcane instead, they did it better anyways."

12777,"This game saved my life.

I am 38.

My ex-wife and I have a daughter together, and adopted our son together. They are now both 4 years old.

When we were going through our separation, I found myself lost and miserable. I was self destructive. I got so mad one day from everything spiraling out of my control that I punched some concrete in a moment of overwhelming emotion. That caused me to break my 5th metacarpal in my right hand... my working hand... my games hand.. the hand that I held and carried my children to bed with.. The hand I desperately needed to make sure I could continue to provide.

After learning of the severity of my self-inflicted damage, I was borderline suicidal. Keep in mind that just a few months before this, I was the happiest man with no history of depression or anxiety. I have never had fits of rage, or been one to break down and cry, but I was in a low spot that just really buried me from being able to see the light on the other side.

Having nothing better to do, I searched for a game I could play, ONE HANDED while I recovered. I somehow stumbled upon this game and read some of the reviews. I decided that it had to be worth a shot... I must admit, I didn't beat the game, or play nearly as long as some of you. In fact, I may have only played this game a day or two.. With that being said, after doing so, I had a new found joy and hope for life. I was able to put behind me the pain and suffering that had been cast over me. I was able to experience other peoples joy and happiness. I was able to see the fruits of my ""labor"". I relaxed for 5 :hillary: :hillary: :hillary: :hillary: :hillary: :hillary: :hillary: minutes to this music long enough to realize that I was going to be okay.
After coming to that realization, I turned the game off, and I went back to work. It hurt my hand like hell but I was motivated. I stopped feeling so damn sorry for myself, and I became the father I needed to be in that moment, not the weak boy I was behaving as.

Today, I am close friend with my kids mother. We don't fight, or argue, or say hurtful things to each other. We are parents, and friends.

I now have 3 kids. My third child is, wait for it, ALSO 4 YEARS OLD. The woman I am with was going through a very similar situation at the time of my own separation, and we just stumbled in to each others life unexpectedly. We have been in a relationship for a year now, and are very happy together.

Moral of the story, you never know what life holds in store for you, and if I would have given up when all the odds were stacked against me, I wouldn't be where I am today. This silly little game helped me realize that.

Thank you"

12794,"You will play until you get into a team of 4 trash players, with offensively nationalistic nicknames that will insult you and everyone else, insult nationalities, and at the end of the game they will throw you 4 reports, for some trifle. For these 4 reports, regardless of likes, you will be banned and decency will be reduced. Then they will be reduced again with such players. And when you drop below 4000 decency, you can't go back, everyone is messing with each other for no reason, they merge games, they insult. Thanks dota2, worst decency logic in the world.

13026,Meh.
13027,The most toxic community in the world. Also the conduct summary system is broken and developers dont seem to care about fixing it. I just stopped playing Dota because I was getting zero reports and my conduct summary kept going down for no reason or it will be increased by 100 pts. On the other hand when you a get 3 reports in 15 games your conduct summary with drop with at least 2k points. Very unpleasant experience for new players and old too as people are throwing reports right and left and developers dont care at all. I tried to contact them and explained to them the issue but they dont care at all. Dont play this game it's really not worth  the experience.
13028,I love Dota!
13029,Haven't played in years come back have no idea what im doing to be yelled at by toxic players fun experience.......

13033,"Worst matchmaking in the history of video games. Low to mid level ranked is completely unplayable, high ranking players keep buying low-level smurf accounts and ruining games for everyone else. When playing solo games, you get maybe one out of 10 games where you don't have 1-2 account buyers in the enemy team. Didn't use to be this bad but in the last 2 years it's gone even worse. Don't waste your time."

13096,"I respect DOTA 2 for being an excellent game but there are things that make this unplayable for me. 1) Comeback mechanics - in a competitive game (e-sport really) there is no place for comeback mechanics. If a team plays well they deserve to get an advantage. By giving advantages to the losing team, DOTA 2 is essentially invalidated as a sport. It becomes casual like Mario Cart, where the player in first will get weak bananas and the player who is last gets 3 red shells. DOTA 2 is still valid as a game, but not as a sport. 2) Neutral items - add random and un-required complexity to a game that was already infinitely complex. 3) Toxicity - the community is highly toxic even in unranked games. You can mute voice and text chat but then the teamwork elements of the game suffer. Human nature is to blame others for our shortcomings and with the anonymity of the internet DOTA 2 is rampant with unpleasantness. There are infinite ways to play DOTA and there will always be someone who takes exception to your decision making. It is a shame because as I said at the start, I have respect for DOTA 2 as a game."

13121,"Honestly really do love this game. I've played for about 10 years at this point and the game has gone nothing but downhill. At this point in the game, you either sit there waiting for a match for 15 minutes, or it unfairly matches you with an enemy team. There are so many smurfs its not even funny, and the amount of times I've been rematched against the same players is disgusting for a game with 300,000 current players. Hope that they start to figure out there matchmaking, as it has completely ruined a beautiful game."

13175,"One of the best online games of the century. The game doesn't have a good story mode but it is meant to be a multiplayer game. It is a 2d/3d game which involves strategy, teamwork and competitiveness. It's got a huge community since the game is free. The community is not that bad but not good either, often cursing each other for teammates faults but it's how they get along to win. The community is filled with players all over the world , some may speak English some may not which you need to get adjusted to(it's fun to learn words from another language). Gameplay is just awesome, the ability effects are brilliant and can't believe it's such a small size game. The game constantly gives you updates which may involve bug fixes and new features. 
The only thing which is not free is the cosmetics although you do get them in form of drops. All the 30 plus playable characters have brilliant effects, unique dialogues and abilities which set them apart. Another awesome feature is ranked gameplay, which brings seriousness to the game and helps your team to thrive towards victory. If you have not played this game yet you have missed out on something amazing. Getting used to the game at first can be difficult but it's better later on."

13192,Every update creates a new formula of strategy making it not boring and they make it as simple as they can so that new players of dota can easily understand they also have tutorial that is very impressive. Teaching basics and advanced techniques that could really be useful in the game. Although due to its ever changing updates some players cannot catch up to the updates and some old players are having hard time understanding the flow of the game. But with a few matches you should be able to get back on the competitiveness of DOTA

Love this game. I get to sit down and zone out, away from people for between 30 and 90 minutes at a time. (I play against Bots) Which is amazing some days. And, it's FREE? Although I suspect that is valves way of getting us all to *redacted* *redacted* *redacted* *redacted* *redacted* *redacted* *redacted* *redacted* *redacted*. Which is pretty smart, when you think about it-right? Microsoft and all those others could stand to learn a few things from Gabe and his minions. Speaking of, when you gonna make Counterstrike into VR? You've done Half Life Alyx, when do we get the amazing mods?

Try playing as Techies. It's fun. Until they get hit with the nerf stick. :-("

Negative: Developers keep failing to deal with the smurfs, it should be as easy as ""infinite amount of reports"" when claiming that a player is a Smurf, there's an unmistakable way that a smurf's profile look like, by now most of the smurfing problem should be fixed, the toxicity in the other hand, its a huge problem easily fixed by removing all comunication for a week whenever a player gets 3 communication reports a day."

13702,"Hello everybody it is going to be a real review on this game.

{FOR NEWCOMERS}
 
To start with I am quite an experienced player who had played for  3500 hours at least, so I have something to say.
If you are thinking about trying this game, do not do that it will ruin your life and it will have negative consiquences for your mental health, so if you want to save it never press ""Download"" in case if you did, press ""Delete"". Thank you.
Here are some reasons why you should not play the game:

1. No matter how you master your role either you are a carry or a support If your team does not want to win you almost never will.

2. No matter on which rank are you there is always ""This guy"" who wants to ruin you the game even though you have 10K behaviour score. 

3. Sometimes when everything seems fine, you almost won the game but no ""This guy"" decided to press buy back and destroy all his items because you have another teammate who is  long-tongued.

4. Every game to be right must include 4 normal players who want to win and 1 guy who is either acc buyer, toxic, ruiner or  booster(he is usually on the opposite team) Booster is the person who is paid to win the game on someones account.

5. I am probably sure that nobody will read till that moment but anyway. I wrote all this disadvantages of playing DOTA2 but did not even mention that this game is not easy. So it means that  you need  to be able to deal with  all the bad people(there is few good, but not to much) and try to understand what you need to do with all this heroes in the game 


(FOR THOOSE WHO THINK THAT PLAYING RANKED GAMES NOT SERIOUS IS FINE)
Please if you want to play tha game it is fine, do whatever you want but do that in Allpick not at the Ranked games(people want to gain MMR and play serious DOTA2 without being distracted by the other ruiners. 

If you have any questions, leave them down below in the comments. I will try to answer them. Sorry that I made you read this text, but I hope it will help some fo you to make right decision.

13755,"Supports get continuously nerfed into the grave, while carries get buffed every update. I miss the necronomicon.

I think that valve is lazy because that's the perception they give off, I don't think of them as professionals but a bunch of unproductive people laying around a lounge collecting a paycheck and patting each-other on the back for doing work occasionally...whenever they feel like it with no direction or focus.
I think Valve doesn't listen to the community around it that tells them what they want to buy, what they want to see, what they hope for. Valve needs a leader with vision for the future a leader with focus and drive like the team leader that HAD to be created to make half life alyx. I hope epic games gets strong enough to be real competition for steam so they can start being competitive again.

13783,"After 1310...hours of my life spent on this game... I should firstly probably admit I have a gaming problem...But that's a separate issue to writing this review. 
This online battle arena is one of the most popular versions for a reason,

That reason is probably in part, because it's free to play.
However the battle arena offers you the ability to pick from over 100 different heroes, and fight on an equal footing with your team of 4 other Heroes against 5 adversaries. The mission is simple, to destroy the enemies main tower. In order to do this you are required to battle your way through the enemy on 3 different approaches/ lanes and destroy anywhere from 3-9 towers.

In order to do this, you can buy items from a shop and level up your abilities. Doing this faster than the enemy is the way to win, and the only way to do it faster than the enemy is to kill more things. This naturally means you are in a race with the other team, and time is precious; everything including your death could mean you fall behind in the race. 




Because games typically last around 30 mins, games are intense, and people get passionate (Expletive*) off at the end if they lose. For those that know, this is what fuels the game it's ridiculously toxic community. And for those dregs of the community, including yourself (should you be rude or you just disconnect in a bunch of games) , you may end in a horrible mode called single draft- low priority. For the dregs of that community. This is a combination of players who aren't team players or have disconnected the game. There's not enough players here to be matched according to skill, so be prepared to get your ass kicked loads, especially if you're new to the game..You will be forced to play every hero, and you will have no idea how to play them. 

I should probably mention this is a team game, and the most successful teams stick to the roles: support/ carry. Generally speaking supports try to help their carries level faster, and their carries are responsible for bringing the late game hammer and smashing down towers. Within the 2 overarching roles there are different roles, initiator, nuker, durable, escape, etc... and heroes can be played in different ways to do fulfil these positions in order to win team fights and destroy towers, 

Good game, but be prepared to get very frustrated with the game."

The community is very toxic and aggressive though and sometimes you just want to bang your head on the wall. DotA is like a toxic relationship one moment you are loving it highly and the next moment you want to delete and never play it again. 

SIDENOTE: Might ruin your life and make you go insane."

13901,"While League of legends runs itself into the ground with constant needless updates and more and more broken heroes with 12 dashes and poorly thought out ability kits, DOTA continues to reign supreme as the most sophisticated and complete MOBA on the market, with new heroes fitting seemlessly with old heroes, each game feels different. Although some heroes' impacts are naturally bigger than others, all of the heroes have their place.

The fact that it's free and all heroes are available from the start just shows how much dev team are.

14019,Dota 2 is perhaps the best MOBA game that was made! I cannot understand why people play League of Legends when there is Dota 2!

14022,do not destroy your life and future with this game
14023,ok
14024,"This is a good game but it eats away at you.

 If you want to actually enjoy it you have to win, obviously always losing isn't as much fun.  To win you have to invest a lot of time into the game and macro as well as micro managing skills. Even in my case as a league of legends player it still takes time to get used to the different items and heroes. 

If you don't want to start the endless mental suffering that is MOBA games, I'd skip this one."

14035,"""Just when I thought I was out, they pull me back in"" - Michael Corleone. 

Dota is like that ex of yours that you try so hard to forget about but end up back with for a week before you remember why you broke it off in the first, 2nd, and 3rd time.. But God dammit the feeling you get in that week worths a lifetime.

Abuse it at your own risk."

14037,"What a complete waste of time. But games are measured in how well they are at wasting ones time, so 10/10 but would not recommend.

14038,"life is strange , stop coming back dota when you have a problem . deal with it stop running away. playing this game will not solve anything,  you just gain more toxic. but if you can encounter all those toxicity in this game, you just like them but it will hurt yourself more. hurting yourself will effect your life. dota is just a game not a place."

14040,dont ever play this game

14396,"I remember when Dota 2 first came out, when everyone was still playing Dota1, and many friends didn't want to switch to Dota 2. However, under the amway of friends, after trying a game of Dota2, I could no longer extricate myself. More and more humanized game operations, rich game experience, fine graphics, exquisite game character models, and exquisite dubbing, there are always so many places to surprise you.

The charm of dota2 is not only the game, but also that it has an unparalleled international invitational tournament. TI series of competitions, in addition to TI1 is not watched live, other competitions, basically stay up late to watch live broadcasts. The most memorable is TI2, . As an iG brain fan, seeing iG's performance on TI2, the ship fat hands left the keyboard, raised his arms to mock the opposite, and finally held up the champion shield; saw that the big mother had been expressionless, walked out of the battle room, and was picked up by puppey's father; the moment he saw Shi Fo yyf smile, his heart was really extremely excited. TI3, the Chinese team collectively withered, but had to be impressed by the strategy and tactics of team A, and the final match between team A and Navi was really applauded. TI4, the Chinese team made a comeback, the big Mu Golden Immortal blocked the killing, the Buddha blocked the state of killing the Buddha, people were impressed. TI5, this is the year of newcomers, Sumail, ZAI, RTZ, maybe, CTY, leprechauns, this TI basically began to update."

14428,"Come stop your crying
It will be alright
Just take my hand
Hold it tight

I will protect you
From all around you
I will be here
Don't you cry

For one so small,
You seem so strong
My arms will hold you,
Keep you safe and warm

This bond between us
Can't be broken
I will be here
Don't you cry

'Cause you'll be in my heart
Yes, you'll be in my heart
From this day on
Now and forever more

You'll be in my heart
No matter what they say
You'll be here in my heart always

Why can't they understand the way we feel?
They just don't trust what they can't explain
I know we're different but deep inside us
We're not that different at all

And you'll be in my heart
Yes, you'll be in my heart
From this day on
Now and forever more

Don't listen to them
'Cause what do they know (what do they know)?
We need each other
To have, to hold.
They'll see in time
I know

When destiny calls you
You must be strong (you gotta be strong)
I may not be with you
But you've got to hold on
They'll see in time
I know
We'll show them together

'Cause you'll be in my heart
Believe me, you'll be in my heart
I'll be there from this day on,
Now and forever more

Oh, you'll be in my heart (you'll be here in my heart)
No matter what they say (I'll be with you)
You'll be here in my heart (I'll be there) always

Always
I'll be with you
I'll be there for you always
Always and always
Just look over your shoulder
Just look over your shoulder
Just look over your shoulder
I'll be there always.

And the game is coded so that everyone must have 50% winrate.. this just kills the whole point soloque. You either win with stomp or loose with stomp.

Weapons so strong, none could handle all of their power at once, When he passed away his sons swore to protect them bit the oldest was consumed by darkness and wanted to posses them. A Battle between brothers broke out but the oldest was struck down and banished to the underworld, peace returned and the younger brother hid the weapons but knowing his older brother's ambition for power, he placed a guardian to protect them, and for fear from his own demise a map for an honest man to hide, that honest man was your father and the older brother is lord Garmadon and i need to find those weapons before he does"

Do you want to play Sniper? Get ready to be trashed by everyone!
Do you want to PLAY ?! Get ready to be trashed by everyone!
Do you want to play unranked? Get ready for 1 hour long pure stress!
Do you want to play turbo mode? Get ready for 1 hour long pure stress!

There's no discrimination in this game. 
There can't be because you hate everyone and everyone hates you.
It doesn't matter if you are russian, ukrainian, iranian, bulgarian, romanian, turkish, brazilian, you are still going to the place deeper than hell which is called ""Low priority match"". There is no escaping from that kind of limbo because the people that suffer there want you to suffer as well and if you try to escape they will pull you back again.

Get ready to be trashed a lot and being reported all the time.

14653,Not great not terrible

14689,good game. but bad game
14690,666
14691,Basically league with crappy mechanics & ban system that blocks you from playing just because you prefer to fight VS AI fights all the time instead of toxic players.  Too bad.
14692,Matchmaking is not kind to new players. Every game feel like an absolute stomp by a bunch of players with fairly new accounts all set to private. I rest my case.

14714,"This game will take everything from you, time, money, sanity its worse than addiction. 

Every time you start game you lose atleast 40 min of your life for exchange of path of hell. 
Either you lose misserably by getting outplayed becouse you are bad and feeling so under pressure and nerves that you want to destroy everything.
Or your teammates drag you down, even though you didnt make mistake and pour everything you can to win.

I played this game for long time of my life in the span of 8 years i dedicated 1 whole year to this game and the reasson for that is the joy and fullfilment you get after you win. After you crush your enemies as you stomp on ants while they cant do anything. The turnaround when you lost all hope, but suddenly enemies throw the game and you comeback and win.

I have never felt anything better in my life than winning game of dota, this game gives you total emptiness or overwhelming joy. 
I recommend to play with friends otherwise you will lose yourself in void, even if they are better or worse, dont forget this is a teamgame with complex tactic, pace, heroes, objectives. 
Team is the most importat thing in this game even when you play against better players you can beat them with cooperation as team. Every possition is complex and there are none which are more important."
14715,"hello, I have repeatedly written to you and asked you to make sure that I did not use cheats and other third-party programs during the game. But you apparently didn't. Moreover, I even resigned myself to the fact that you will not help me with this problem, and admitted the use of third-party software (which I naturally did not) in order to at least return my inventory to another account
I am very sorry and insulting to realize that you  do not care about ordinary players"

It has millions of cool mods, not only being one game, but being several mini games, which is even better. After all, this game was a mod, and other games are born from it, like the autochess game.

I strongly suggest to mute other players, it makes life more peaceful."

14892,"I honestly believe that if you give the game the time needed to get a hang on some of the stuff this game provides, you will enjoy the game.

 It's better than any moba right now in 2022 imo. I like that if players give a huge complaint in twitter or reddit, valve will legitimately attempt to fix the problem. Most importantly this game is more easily balance-able and better managed. 

The game has so much unique complexities and without all that it'd just be any other game."
14893,As complex as chess. I think the biggest issue people have in this game is not speaking the same language as their teammates. 10/10.
14894,"IF you can get past the intense learning curve, this game is great. It is a slower paced moba with long fights and teamwork. Unlike a particular moba *cough *cough *league of legends, this game encourages you to work together with your team to win. If you like creating strategies to win a game and executing them this is the moba for you. That said there is still some micro to pay attention to such as last hitting and denying creeps, but the overall gameplay is largely focused on macro. If you want a moba that will test your ability to make plays and out plan your opponents this is the Moba for you.

That said, if you want something fast paced and quick fights, while the fights in dota don't last minutes at a time they  aren't over in a flash. The average game time of a dota match ive found is anywhere between 30-40 minutes, occasionally going to 50 minutes if the game is especially close. The game can feel slow at times and if you don't know where to be and what to do it can feel like there are spans of time in which you can't do anything. If you aren't interested in putting in many, many hours in learning and you are not interested in having anyone teach you the game I do not recommend trying to learn it."

14902,"DotA 2, nothing to say, sometimes it's a best game ever, sometimes worst game ever ;)"
14903,"[H1]A wonderful game. As soon as I started playing it, my mom got a permanent job. Not only my father returned to my family, but a second one also appeared. And I also learned a lot of secrets about my family: it turns out I have a sister. At the same time, without knowing her, I met her boyfriend and learned about her crazy life. I found out why I still had 1 more father.
Even in this beautiful game, I was diagnosed. And not alone. It turned out that I was very ill and people offered me financial assistance, I ask where to send money for treatment.
I also had problems in psychological and sexual education. I found out that I love being raped by a guy in the ass.
I also found out that I work at a beer factory. And I always play this wonderful game after a hard shift in which I fell into a barrel of beer.
A lot of amazing things happened to me,and all thanks to this wonderful game."
14904,"Game makes me angry, but after a few it atleast gets worse. Broke my mouse a few time and had to wash my mouth out with soap for use of bad language but all in all great game, especially when you play turbo against sweaty south africans who counter pick all the time with the frosty addition of a pudge in every single game if you dont ban him on your only ban, leaving you with more cancer lineups too endure for 30 more minutes. Addicting game, so get it to not only ruine your afternoons, but also extend that frustation into your line of work, family events and love life. Atleast the overprisead skins are sweet. #kapa"
14905,"My entire teenage I have played Dota, and let me tell you, no other game is as deep and as complex to learn as this one. I dont think anybody has mastered it yet till this day. And every patch it feels like its a all new game.

All that aside, you can have a lot of fun playing it, the community can be a little bit toxic, but playing with friends, specially if you can close a party of 5 it is pure joy, I love this game so much that I dont even play it anymore but keep watching pro matches and streaming content eventually.


The bad side of the game as I said before is the toxic community, and also the duration of matches, I`ve stopped playing cause I dont have 50 mins anymore to spend playing a silly game, but if you do then go all in buddy!"

14968,"This game goes out of its way to waste your time and is highly unwelcoming to newer players who want to learn.

1) games may be enjoyable at higher ranks, but this game is more enjoyable playing with bots as teammates than playing with real people at the lower ranks. I don't mind people not knowing how to play as everyone is learning, but the toxicity in chat is unbearable to the point where you just want to turn chat off. At that point, why play with other people at all? Better yet, why play this game at all?

2) games are way too long, especially at lower ranks, meaning that its hard to practice and focus on certain aspects of the game without sitting around in a 45-60 minute game. 

3) no give up option means you are sitting there waiting for an additional 10-15 minutes for the other team to end it. Sure there are the occasional comebacks, but its not worth the time wasted sitting around in the other 90 percent of losing games when I would like to hop into the next game to practice certain mechanics like say early game CS.

Will not try any other mobas again in the future.

15098,"This is a very competitive game. 17 years of playing, since DotA 1, I am finally ending my career with this game. Haha!

Its complexity is what makes it beautiful. The community is not great at all, to be honest; especially if you're playing solo like me. It's great with friends for some time, but eventually, like all of my friends, they end up quitting as well. Like all the other reviews, this game is great but I regret all the time I've invested on it. One best thing in this game, this isn't pay to win.

I hate other players especially when they queue for a certain role, and select an inappropriate hero. Maybe, Valve should disable heroes that aren't capable of doing the selected role. In this manner, it will prohibit players to queue up very fast by choosing support roles but picking carry heroes. This act actually ruins any game.

I like the constant updates with heroes' abilities and certain items to achieve the correct ""balance."" Overall, DotA 2 is a great game especially for competitive players‚Äînot for casual gamers. 

Thanks DotA! I'll wait for your third-person-MMO-like gameplay."

15153,"IF you can find 4 team players to join you it is an amazing game - sadly this is not possible most of the time.

The playing alone/solo experience is terrible (and sometimes toxic) since 1+ of 4 teammates will generally ruin the game by refusing to cooperate.
Valve is refusing to help players find teammates since they rather focus on monetization than easily solve this basic issue which is splitting up and destroying the community.
The community is trying to solve the issue but is failing because the sites attempting to solve the issue don't have enough users, eg.: https://www.teamtavern.net/games/dota2/players ,  https://squadgrid.com/dota2/players , https://www.challengermode.com/dota2/team-finder or https://www.epal.gg/epals/dota2-lfg."

You've been warned.




(Btw, only maybe 10 characters out of 100 interested me at all.. and only 4 of those had decent voice acting, imo. The rest were lame/boring, and their VA was either just as bad or somehow worse?)"

It's also ridiculously easy for people to smurf for which they don't get punished, I played three games in a row against a self admitted smurf and then had a crazy long queue time."

15300,"dota and the genre it created is a bit of a mixed bag when it comes to multiplayer games imo
on the one hand it feels infinitely complicated with infinite room to strategize and theorize, on the other the skill factor can often feel limited with these autoattack RPG games, like you would boot up a game saying ""i can't wait to make some plays"" but then you really don't think there was a single play you could make that game. And the flaming is so ubiquitous no matter where if it be herald 1 equivalent normals or streamed top ranked games people will accuse each other of being ""bad"" presuming anyone cares or that it matters. it's honestly one of the most annoying things if you do try to improve or compete, since it actually is a very difficult game and to have people(often of very dubious credentials or merit) trying to make you feel bad for every mistake when there are so many to make ought to be highly annoying indeed! 
so I think it would help everyone to remember that you are playing a team-game with completely random people at the end of the day and to allay ones expectations appropriately, and i would recommend to stop playing when you do not find it fun."

15385,"Love it or hate it. This game is here to stay until we grow old. Played since 2005, during the 6.x series (still a noob till today). Was really not interested to play the sequel (Dota 2) at first but in 2014 (for love of the game) I tried playing again, felt left out for a few days, but kept plaing. Stopped for a year, back again in 2016 when TNC made noise in TI beating the crowd favorite OG in the lower bracket of main event who had Miracle in the roster also. Didn't want to stop but pandemic happened and I can't play because my low level pc was damaged during a flash flood back in 2018, would have loved to purchase battle pass that got 3 arcanas to give but no got no pc (purchased two bp in past TIs) watched almost all the games in TI 10 as long as I can (as I did in most major tournaments in the past) no playing or logging in (but kept playing in piso nets in my area) logged back again in 2021 (got a new pc, this time a better one, no gpu but good enough for dota not to freeze, it got ssd and acceptable ram) even with this new pc, I haven't really got the luxury to play for long hours since I'm also enrolled in culinary school. Currently following the ESL One Stockholm major.

For those who didn't tl;dr, thanks a lot ;)"
15386,"disconnect cant connect again

15387,"when u have nothing to do. when u r in bunch of stress, come and find dota. This game will bring u the worse than what u have been suffered all those time. This game is for metal mental men, not for wimpy kids"

15395,"Great game. Requires a lot of intellect and teamwork. 
It is like chess but on steroids. 
Love the fact that it requires so much thinking. 
I learn about life through this game. How to manage a team. How to motivate. 
How to apply pressure on opponent at the same time. 
If you want to click and don't use brain, this is not for you. 

1) Play normal if you want to relax after work. 
2) Play ranked if you want a challenge. 
Some servers a bit toxic. So beware, be ready to mute the negative team mates."

I realize Valve does not make actual games anymore but at least get this part of their business right. Idiots."
15405,"I have spent almost 10 years playing this game. It's terrible, the community is toxic, every new hero is horribly unbalanced on launch, the learning curve keeps getting higher with every major update, and the worst part of it is no diretide :( 
10/10 would gladly sink 10 more years into it! thank you icefrog for this horrible but wonderful game"

15454,"The game was fine few years ago. Now it's basically unplayable because of nonfunctional matchmaking, smurfs, boost accounts and griefers. If you try to talk about those problems or try to find the solution - mods just closes the thread whenever they want to. People have observed strange things when trolls come to a discussions and soon after thread is closed because it ""derailed from topic"". This is how Valve deals with problems? Just don't waste your time if matchmaking is not fixed and to be frank i don't think it ever will. Basically if you are reading this and thinking if you want to try this game, sadly you are very late to a party and you won't find anything good what you heard so much about dota before. Yes, i played almost 8k hours of dota and it was sad to see dota crumble little by little through all those years into a mess that is now."

You can't disable that stuff, you must download 30+ GB of it to play the game. Also, their support for Linux is awful. The performance is lower and occasionally you get updates that degrade it even further.

The game itself is nice though. In short, I's say that Dota is a good idea that was implemented in a bad and toxic to its players way."

In the words of Geico, ""it's so easy a caveman could do it!"" and yet... people can't do it! MORONS!

I can't tell you how many times I've played INCREDIBLY well only to have it ruined by people who a. didn't know how to play, and were not receptive to suggestions AT ALL, or b. knew how to play, but refused to cooperate. 10/10 the worst experience I've ever had with a game."

15729,THIS GAME IS DEAD TOOK MORE THAN 10 MINS TO FIND MATCH GG DEAD GAME BYE BYE
15730,"I can't imagine being a new player in the dota scene at this point, there's simply too much to learn and not enough easily-accessible resources for it. That said, if you're looking for a moba with more depth than League but doesn't deviate from the traditional formula too much this game is worth a try. The learning curve really isn't so bad if you are willing to take some time to mess around in bot matches or have a stack of friends who are willing to coach you, and you can now request community coaches as well.

Valve has done a good job pushing major updates every few months to shake up the meta and moment-to-moment gameplay which is probably the biggest reason why people still enjoy the game. The most significant shortfall is that there are not enough new players joining and/or staying, almost everyone in even the middling skill brackets has been playing for ~10 years. While that may show how much dedication the game's following has it's not a great indicator for the community mindset or overall quality."

15760,"Too unbalanced on the min and maxes of the heroes, many things are needed to get nerfed, and many things are unintuitive without proper guidance.
One too many things in its game design are trying to be better than LoL, making the dev tryhards and delivering a mediocre game that only survives due to some clever ideas and its remarkable predecessor, the classic dota."
15761,best game ever
15762,Needs a public banlist like Battle.net did. This game is full of trash kids who leave the game and grief and feed. WOULD NOT RECOMMEND.

15775,Game is complete garbage the community and players you get matched with are the most toxic I have ever encountered in any game. I used to spend thousands of dollars on this game back in 2015-17 but coming back to the game this year just proved its not worth coming back and actually spending money or investing time in to grind in ranked MMR. Find a better game to spend money and time on this ones a dying breed.

15840,i got mental ill when play this game

15842,The game for me is quite fun but when it inst it really isn't and the low prior system as a whole is the worst concept possible and i think they should be executed via firing squad but asides from that i do enjoy the game but do not recommend

15847,"If your considering weather or not to start dota dont, you will have no social life and wont play any games, also you will probably suck at it even if you have 4000 + hours, so live a normal life and lit us rot in our hell."
15848,"the game is very amazing with all the action going on.
this is my first MOBA game i played and i think it's the best as well.
"
15849,"I wish I could go back in life. Not to change anything, but to feel a few things twice. Playing Dota for the first time is one of them. This game is full of nostalgia for me. Haven't played it in years but every time I come back just to play a match or two, it fills me up with joy."

15916,"This game will either strengthen your mental and toxic resistance or destroy your life and turn you into a racist bastard 

If you endured it though, you will be surprised of how tolerant you can be toward people in you IRL.

Yes, this is not just a game, it's a game that teaches you about life, teaches you about patience, teaches you about how stupid people can be, teaches you that something is inevitable no matter how hard you try to prevent it, teaches you about how cruel the world can be, and finally, it would make you, at some point, questioning yourself of why are you still playing this piece of sht.  

Great game
Probably will still playing it

- not enough fun and gameplay for those that made this game big more than 10 years ago"
16233,nice game
16234,"For a little bit of context, I picked up a key when the game was in closed beta back in 2011-2012, played one game against bots then quit because my laptop was too old to run it properly and also because I had no idea what was going on.

I still kept an eye on this game because its mechanics and depth allowed to do some really cool stuff.

I finally decided to get back to it very recently, but this time with a little bit of knowledge. I started playing against bots to try out some heroes but the broken AI made it a bit difficult.

Once I felt ready I jumped into normal queue and... boy what a mess.
The matchmaking is bonkers. As a new player, I get matched with/against veterans with 5k games and fully upgraded relics who expect you to be absolutely perfect in every aspect. Every game is a stomp, be it a defeat or a victory.

After a couple games, I got a conduct report (!) which showed that I had been reported twice despite never misbehaving. Basically, I got reported for being new which is insane.

I'm required to play 100 hours to queue for ranked games, but I don't think I'll have the patience to go this far because now that I think about it, I didn't enjoy any of the normal games I've played so far. I just wish I hadn't wasted all this time watching videos and reading the wiki.

TL;DR Stay the hell away from this game if you haven't played it for 10 years already as it is extremely frustrating and punishing for new players."

16257,"WORST GAME EVER WITH THE MOST TOXIC COMMUNITY!!!! My grandmother visited me and saw how I played Dota, 2 weeks later she passed away with Cancer. That is not even the worst part.... I found out that all of the kids visiting their Grandparents in the Cancer Ward was on their way to a DOTA Tournament. This was extremely heartbreaking for me, as I truly loved Dota, not my MeeMaw. 

One positive about DOTA is that my Step-Fathers insults do not hurt me anymore. I have become much stronger than I was, but this does come with a Price. I did become Cancerous myself.... I only found out when I entered civil and knowledgeable conversation that I saw what a small child I became.

I now sit in the corner of my room just licking my Window in between Dota Games... Thanks for Reading #PrayForHarambe"

The amount of trolls and salt in this game have not decreased since I first started this game and in fact I can assure you it's increasing by the day. Overall this game is worth the time and is a good place to go to when you're trying to escape from your real life problems.

[b] What can you expect as a new player [/b]

- This game has an extreme complexity depth, not only will you need to spend time to learn what each hero does.but also what each item does, laning, rotation, map layout + hidden spots, warding, last hitting, denys and hero combos.
- Be prepared to be scolded / reported and screamed at for the entire duration of the game by your team if you are new to the game and not pulling your on weight.
- If the level gap between you and your opponents is too large, be prepared to be killed in 1/2 hits.
- Veterans will abuse broken mechanics.
- Every patch will almost (100%) introduce something broken, be prepared to relearn each hero every patch."

16514,"This game turned me into a hardened gladiator. 

  I used to be archon, then my poor naive childlike mind was shattered by the toxic community, and soon I grew addicted to the downward spiral of a troll. Every spiteful natured denizen of the desolate hellscape that is ranked matchmaking that trolled my games by going afk or screaming racial slurs at me, usually in a foreign language drained me mentally. 

  Every time my support bought out our wards to plant in base turned me into the very monster that I feared would consume me one day, and I fear I may never be able to love again. Please heed my warning, there is no ranked season reset. No second chances, No alt accounts.
It doesn't matter if you're trying your best, if little Billy decides he wants to first time Primal Beast in ranked and feed 21 kills because they wanted to get drunk turn the game into an even bigger gamble with the mmr of the 4 other people on their team on the line for maximum dopamine points as the pay-off, and bragging rights in the form of ""I was so fucked up and ruined the game for 9 other people and won anyways! I'm so good ;^)""

The mentality you must adapt if you want to climb in this game is; If you fuck up, it's your fault, if you get unlucky, you need to improve more, if your mental is weak, you should play a different game, because you will be ruined

The most you can hope for is to get a positive k/d/a every game, because winning is sometimes out of your hands."

16546,"I have to update my review of this game. My favourite game ever but the matchmaking has gotten worse and worse in the last 12 months that I've cut my hours down to almost 0 in the last 8 months from nearly spending every spare minute I had playing. It really is a shame because they worked very hard getting the toxicity out (still there but not as often), leavers etc but now it seems the matchmaking is all over the place not the mention the sheer amount of smurfs ruining the game.

I'm not against new players just if 1 team has a new player, the other should too but it has been the opposite. 1 team with a new player, the other team gets significantly better experienced players, completely unbalancing the game and wasting time for everyone, and the new player learning absolutely nothing.

I will continue to return every few months to see if it has improved but at the moment would not recommend this game to new players."

Yup, that's normal. If you don't have this, there will undoubtedly be a smurf on the other team because reports do nothing in this game, unless someone abandons.

I'm living in a third world country that doesn't have stable internet. It causes me getting abandoned from some Turbo matches. Now I'm bloody stuck on Single Draft and needs to win for at least 3 matches (with my poor Internet). Timed punishment is a better option.

If you guys don't have stable internet, don't even think to play this game.

The way that this game has so much depth and so much learn is so insane to me,, the smallest things can make the hugest impact, you have to actively know how to counter-pick thorugh different playable heroes and purchasable items which still might not make a huge impact. The way this game relies on so much to be good is just so cool to me,, this is quickly beocming one of my most played games on steam and it still only feels like I'm beginning to start i guess,, a longer journey and experience for this game."

There will be 1-2 new heroes a year and rebalancing, but rarely do things change. I like that because I am old. Crystal Maiden plays almost exactly the same as she did in 2010. I appreciate that, so I know I can always come back to DOTA and play a few games and not be completely incompetent and have to learn everything all over again.

17078,I can't believe i'm still playing this game since Defense of the Ancient days and Frozen Throne ladder. That's 20 years lol! aside from Warcraft II in the 90s!!! I still enjoy playing it despite of massive changes in the game. That's why i always make it point to buy the Battle passes for Ti every year.  I'm mostly playing Turbo modes cause i'm busy with having a 10 hour job and having a family now. I enjoy turbo coz  even if i suck at farming and laning it gives me a slight chance of still having decent items. It frustrates me coz im wayyyy far from my old mmr 3.5k back when the max mmrs where 5-6k+. I'm now stuck and barely holding on for dear life on Guardian IV lmao! I guess that's the price you pay for growing up. Just keep on playing!

17157,"When i was in high school, i have already been playing dota (frozen throne) before dota 2. i was an addict to the game because , i can play it with my friends and acquaintances, when i got to college, i become even attracted to dota 2.

Started playing this game in 2014 (i was 17 years old at that time). after 2 years of playing dota 2, i become dull playing it hahaha. Anyway, i would recommend this game, if you want long and thrilling game on the process. if your a master of your mains, and everyone knows how to play it, you can finish the game by half an hour(average time to finish 1 hour). The longest time i played this on battle was 2 hours. which was mentally exhausting hahaha. Especially about the trash-talk and toxic gaming of other players, well i got used to it by time. On my first time, i was such a roaster lol. Now i am better in controlling my emotions hehehe.

goodluck and have fun gaming.

"
17158,"3689 hours of my life was spent on this fucking game. Do I hate it? Fuck yes. Do I recommend it? Fuck no. Will I still play it? You bet fucking ass I will. Why? Because there's no other game like Dota 2. There are similar games, yes, this is true. But they are nowhere near as complex as this game. 

I'll probably get old and die playing this game too. I'll hate every single second of it but man, this game is just fucking amazing. Especially if played right."

17175,"If you told me when I started playing dota 2 at 18 years old that I would be reviewing this game after 8 years and 13'000 hours, I would have laughed at you.
Let me put that into perspective: 541 Days and 16 Hours. Of dota 2.

I'm almost 26 now, and I don't really know what to think of this game. This game has had a large impact on my life. I was ""addicted"" to the experience, in ranked and matchmaking. I've learned a lot about myself and others. I've learned a lot about staying in charge of my emotions. I've also learned that emotions can easily lose you a game before its come to its conclusion. I've learned how to react instinctively to changing pixel colours.

But I've also relatively learned nothing.

Not to depress anyone reading this, but when I put all of this into perspective, thinking about what could have been, I could easily imagine how much better my life would be if I never started playing this game. Socially, I would have a stronger network. My education and eventual career would probably have had more longevity (I have played professionally as a dota 2 player, but grew a lack of interest in competing). But I can never be sure how drastic these differences are. Would the pros outweigh the cons? I have certainly met and interacted with a large group of people, because of dota2, at events, tournaments etc. Any dota 2 player that has sunk 2000 hours or so has probably had these thoughts: ""what if I just did ... instead"" or ""what if I just played on a more casual level"". The issue is, that dota feels more rewarding than other things, and that's a trap I fell into.

It is with a heavy heart that I admit that I don't think I can bring myself to play anymore. Took a long 8 years for me to grow out of this perfect fit, which is why I must review dota2 positively.

Thank you for all that you have done for me. Farewell friend."

I patiently waited for almost 2 years to see if they will change the matchmaking system and considering reports seriously. in the end they don't care about the community and people just continue being toxic and bad."

Match making is not random, Valve controls your team mates, team opponent and adjusts the difficulty as you gained experience and learned. No movement at all and Its a waste of time. I suggest Valve should replaced the name ""Rank"" to ""Valve Balance Rank"" and should create new ""Random Rank"". Totally waste of time.  I don't Recommend this game."

I win a game. I lose 3 games. I'm stuck at 10 mmr. BUT. It's still a fun game! I really enjoy most of the characters you can choose from. Plus, they add even more characters every once in a while! I think they added 3 new characters since aug 2021 (Hoodwink, Marci, & Roshann's cousin). If my review doesn't help you decide, you can watch some of my gameplay @ twitch.tv/milkybeartv :3"

It's enough to live with someone who plays it and constantly screams while playing it every day (and this game isn't even a horror game! or is it?) till you learn a new skill: sleeping when someone doing loud monkey noises. Pluses of that is that you can enjoy your dreams no matter the outsides of your pillow. Possible huge con is that you'll probably will sleep through fire in your house, because all those screams will never wake you up.

Wisp was the best. I wish they'll take Wisp and make Wisp Racing Game. Or Wisp Magic Ball. Or Wisp 10 hours version max volume so you'll never ever hear Dota 2 screams and possibly you won't hear anything anymore. Just stare at the light, go into the light, become the light."

17520,"-poorly supported given the development age and revenue
 
-matchmaking deficiency in providing fast and enjoyable games (possibly exacerbated by substantially declining play base)

-reporting system encourages toxic behavior rather than preventing it
 
-overwatch system highly susceptible to corruption and abuse

Other competitive games provide better solutions to the problems effecting them and will likely result in a  greater overall satisfaction to the user given the large investment in time required to become proficient at them."

17582,"Dota is an interesting ever changing game, but its nice that after all this time playing it there's always been one thing I can rely on. Bigots, racists, sexists, and assholes love to use the in game chat function, and just muting people isn't a robust option when they're also trying to call the shots and get other people to go in/dogpile you in chat. I've had a lot of fun in dota, but this game has driven me to tears at times, and many of my friends treat their own experience with Dota as an unhealthy addiction to something that continually brings them harm. Cannot recommend."

17638,"Das Dota 2 ist ein zu Philipinen geh√∂rendes Online Game. Stellen Sie sich vor, dass jeder aus Philipinen stammende Spieler davon besonders in SEA Region auf Pinoyisch spricht. Diese Philipinen streiten sich beim Spielen sehr h√§ufig miteinander. Dann verursachen sie eine sinnlose chaotische Situation. Schlie√ülich verlieren die Spieler das Game.

I only enjoy this game when i'm playing with my friend. (He's a great guy btw, met him in College.)
Sadly, he's kinda busy and the rare times i do play with him are the times where his old/closest/first friends (They're a party of 5) are doing something else like working, vacation trips, fishing etc.

So i just... kinda don't uninstall this game on my PC. Can't say it's addictive enough for me to invest time in it tho.

It's also BRUTALLY difficult if you're not familiar with the genre, let alone latest patch or DOTA at all. There's a full complement of earnable and payable cosmetics, great learning and coaching systems in place to teach you the game, and is extremely well polished at this point. It really represents the peak of the genre and is a popular game for a reason.

Ingredients:

2. 1/2 cup white sugar
3. 1/2 cup brown sugar
4. 1/4 cup water
5. 1/4 teaspoon cinnamon
6. 1 pinch salt
7. 5 apples - peeled, cored and sliced
8. 1 pastry for double-crust pie

Directions:

1. Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C).
2. Combine butter, white sugar, brown sugar, water, cinnamon, and salt in a saucepan over medium heat. Bring to a boil, remove from heat and set aside.
3. Roll out half the pastry to fit a 9-inch pie plate. Place bottom crust in pie plate; pour in apple slices.
4. Roll out top crust into a 10-inch circle. Cut into 8 (1-inch) wide strips with a sharp paring knife or pastry wheel. Weave the pastry strips, one at a time, into a lattice pattern. Fold the ends of the lattice strips under the edge of the bottom crust and crimp to seal.
5. Pour butter-sugar mixture over top of pie, coating the lattice, and allowing any remaining sauce to drizzle through the crust.
6. Bake in the preheated oven for 15 minutes. Reduce heat to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C), and bake until the crust is golden brown, the caramel on the top crust is set, and the apple filling is bubbling, 35 to 40 more minutes. Allow to cool completely before slicing."

17866,"DOTA 2 FROM THE BEGINNER'S SIDE
REVIEW IN ENGLISH:
I started playing Dota 2 only recently, but I still played 200+ hours and I can express a beginner's opinion about this game.
It's worth starting with what this game is (below is a brief introduction). Dota is a team tactical and strategic game with elements of a computer role-playing game in which each player controls one hero, and, if the hero has the appropriate abilities, a certain number of additional creatures. During the gameplay, over time and depending on the success of his actions, the player gains experience by discovering new abilities of his hero, and the money he spends on buying various items. The main task of the game for each of the two teams is to destroy the enemy camp protected by towers.
In short, you choose one of hundreds of heroes, land with your team of five people on the map, pump your hero and break the towers, barracks and then the throne of the enemy, after which the game ends.
Despite the monotonous gameplay, Dota is a very interesting game, which leads to the question - why? Dota is made by its heroes. Each hero has his own abilities, features and style of play, and in each game both allied and enemy heroes are completely different.
In my review, I want to consider all the advantages and disadvantages of this game.
Positive aspects:
-MOBA genre (Multiplayer Online Battle Arena) is a very interesting genre of games. It is important not only reaction and knowledge of the game, but also strategic thinking. The game will definitely appeal to all fans of strategies, because to win, you need to think through a game plan, items to buy, actions and style of play depending on the selected characters.
-Variety of heroes. This has been mentioned more than once, and even here it is worth noting. There is everything here - from magicians to fish, and everything is interesting in its own way. At the moment, there are about 120 heroes in the game.
-Variety of game modes. If you get tired of playing the same scenario (in our case, Allpick, where you can choose any hero), you can try yourself in other game modes. For example, Single Draft. Here you are offered a choice of only 3 randomly selected heroes from different attributes - strength, dexterity or intelligence. There is also a section of the game library where you can play according to scenarios created by the players themselves. I think Dota 1x6 is the best, I advise everyone to play it someday.
Now about the negative sides:
- Complexity. Yes, this is the main disadvantage of Dota. No matter how hard the developers tried - and by means of fairly affordable training, and with the help of manuals, and much more - dota still remained and remains a very difficult game. Many people decide to abandon the game because of its complexity, but I assure you, you should not do this. Check out the manuals on other sites, play with bots, master the basic mechanics and very soon you will be able to enjoy the game in peace.
- Balance. After playing a lot of games, I realized that the balance between dota heroes is very poorly developed. Regardless of the items, knowledge and skills, some heroes will always be stronger than others, and it is very sad that the balance does not improve from update to update. The developers are actively working on this, and I hope that soon this problem will disappear from the game forever.
- A significant part of the community. Most of the community at Dota is not the best. The game has voice and text chat, in which some players can call you names, criticize and even send you. In fact, if you play with high decency, there will be few such players, for example, I have met only 2-3 of them.
That's it. I hope this review was useful. If so, you can support me with a like and a reward, I will be very pleased to know that I helped someone)
Good luck in mastering the game, bye!"

17889,"The game is good but let me describe to you what happens to me almost once a month while trying to play this.... which is enough to make me want to quit this hecking game cause its so frustrating.

I start a match, i play normaly, then i get dc, or the game stops working for no apparent reason... i try to wait it out, nothing happens, i get baned... I try to get out of the game and then go back in... i work... but by the time i am in the game i'm already banned...

There is the wait mechanic... but no one waits...

So i lose mmr and i cant play for an hour because your game is not optimized... and the graphic are so fucking demanding on my pc... like i can play wither 3 with maxed setting, no problem and in dota i use min setting and it runs like a turtle....

No one fucking sees the heroes anyway, we dont play zoomed in... 
It's not optimized at all................

Once the game starts i dont really have any problem with it... but the matchmaking and the loading screens take forever
...
And that gets me baned...

I also have a limited time to play cause i work a lot, and it's just so frustrating when i want to play dota with some friends and relax and then get baned for an hour because i couldnt get past slow loading screens... and i got disconected because you dont optimize your game or run your servers properly....

Why the hell do i have to wait 1 hour because of the mistakes the developer did ??????????
And i cant even play arcade in that time....

Maybe my pc is not the latest generation, i bought it 4 years ago... but c'mon... if your target is just people with very high end pc... what's the point????

Just optimize your game, or make the punishment lighter... or make the wait time longer... i dont know... do something about this... it's extremlly frustrating and it makes me want to quit this game altogether....
even tho i like playing it very much.. it makes the experience horrible."

17946,"If you told me when I started playing dota 2 at 18 years old that I would be reviewing this game after 8 years and 13'000 hours, I would have laughed at you.
Let me put that into perspective: [b] 541 Days and 16 Hours. [/b] Of dota 2. 

I'm almost 26 now, and I don't really know what to think of this game. This game has had a large impact on my life. I was ""addicted"" to the experience, in ranked and matchmaking. I've learned a lot about myself and others. I've learned a lot about staying in charge of my emotions. I've also learned that emotions can easily lose you a game before its come to its conclusion. I've learned how to react instinctively to changing pixel colours.

But I've also relatively learned nothing.

Not to depress anyone reading this, but when I put all of this into perspective, thinking about what could have been, I could easily imagine how much better my life would be if I never started playing this game. Socially, I would have a stronger network. My education and eventual career would probably have had more longevity (I have played professionally as a dota 2 player, but grew a lack of interest in competing). But I can never be sure how drastic these differences are. Would the pros outweigh the cons? I have certainly met and interacted with a large group of people, [b] because [/b] of dota2, at events, tournaments etc. Any dota 2 player that has sunk 2000 hours or so has probably had these thoughts: ""what if I just did ... instead"" or ""what if I just played on a more casual level"". The issue is, that dota [b] feels [/b] more rewarding than other things, and that's a trap I fell into.

It is with a heavy heart that I admit that I don't think I can bring myself to play anymore. Took a long 8 years for me to grow out of this perfect fit, which is why I must review dota2 positively.

Thank you for all that you [b] have [/b] done for me. Farewell friend."

There is way too many OP characters and it's hard to learn the abilities of who does what because you can't even tell what it happening. Just stay on league lmao."

18182,"Took a break for 4 years. Somehow they broke matchmaking, so you can't queue against bots with random people. The bots are all dumber somehow too. It's like they took SMITE terrible matchmaking and thought ""this is fine."" Pinging is now a terrible idea as all bots on map will respond, not the ones closest to it. Of course the bots you play against almost always play like ranked people, but your team bots can't even pick a damn target, when YOU'RE being attacked. What was once a decent matchmaking system is now hard to navigate and pointless because you'll get the same broken match every time unless you have a pre-assembled team, good luck practicing anything. Haven't even bothered with PvP matchmaking I'm sure I'll get put against diamond players even if I queue casual.

18250,DOTA DOTA DOTA
18251,"As of April 21, 2022 Dota 2 is in much better state and less stressful to play compare 2016-2019 gameplay. Compare to years I played back in 2015 - 2020 building item for support hero is almost impossible, ward items are so expensive and heroes has less HP and Mana regeneration. The Devs making the game more difficult to play ex. (nyx assasin 1st skill hard to target enemy) and the inconsistency of the game is so much worst that  so many players quit the game. Those year I find the game stressful to play, most player in our area quit the game at that time, seems Dota 2 is more a headache to play instead we prefer the Dota 1 so much fun and enjoyable. 

Now support heroes has huge chance to build up item wards is now for free blue wards is cheap, farming is now O.K just need a little balancing, game consistency and heavy punishment for AFK players."

This is the swiss cheese that you stole from blizzard,you don't know what you have till its gone. Blizzard feels the pain right now, they didn't value the community or the game when it was at it's peak. Comparatively Valve is still doing a good job but needs to do more. Please don't make stupid cutscenes like Blizzard, invest more on improving gameplay, graphics engine (so that its playable without having access to good hardware) & other important stuff."

I agree with all of them!

I like when they said, ""The most-played game on Steam.
Every day, millions of players worldwide enter battle as one of over a hundred Dota heroes. And no matter if it's their 10th hour of play or 1,000th, there's always something new to discover. With regular updates that ensure a constant evolution of gameplay, features, and heroes, Dota 2 has truly taken on a life of its own.

One Battlefield. Infinite Possibilities.
When it comes to diversity of heroes, abilities, and powerful items, Dota boasts an endless array‚Äîno two games are the same. Any hero can fill multiple roles, and there's an abundance of items to help meet the needs of each game. Dota doesn't provide limitations on how to play, it empowers you to express your own style.

All heroes are free.
Competitive balance is Dota's crown jewel, and to ensure everyone is playing on an even field, the core content of the game‚Äîlike the vast pool of heroes‚Äîis available to all players. Fans can collect cosmetics for heroes and fun add-ons for the world they inhabit, but everything you need to play is already included before you join your first match.

Bring your friends and party up.
Dota is deep, and constantly evolving, but it's never too late to join.
Learn the ropes playing co-op vs. bots. Sharpen your skills in the hero demo mode. Jump into the behavior- and skill-based matchmaking system that ensures you'll
be matched with the right players each game."" - Valve

18398,"[b]Follow my instructions to ALWAYS win in this game![/b]

[u]The Winning Hero selection:[/u]
[b]Hard Support:[/b] Sniper
[b]Soft Support:[/b] Juggernaut
[b]Mid Lane:[/b] Tinker
[b]Safe Lane:[/b] Treant Protector
[b]Off Lane:[/b] Phantom Assassin

How to play Support: 
NEVER buy any wards! If you buy wards, your mates who are playing carry will be super mad! They will probably throw the game if you place too many wards on the map, especially the ""blue"" ones that you have to spend your hard earned coins on! Instead, focus on farming as much as possible. Hit the creeps and let your other mate in the lane know that you will mute them if they warn you not to do it!

How to play Safe Lane carry: 
Run away from Creeps! They are out there to hunt you down and steal your HP. If you see creeps hitting the tower, make sure you run the other way because towers have self-defense capabilities. It is far more important for you to go jungle early on before you even hit lvl 5 because you need the neutral ""shovel"" item to get your early potions and gimmicks. Also, don't steal farm from your Hard Support mate.

How to play Mid lane: 
If you are mid, your task is NOT to help the other two lanes, but actually hit the tower in the middle with brute force. Doesn't matter if you die a couple of times, the most important task is to take that tower down. Ignore the enemy hero and focus on your objective. Also ignore any calls for something the players in this game call ""ganking"" - this isn't your job.

How to play Off Lane: 
Off lane is probably the hardest role to play. The amount of hate you will get is not even funny. So make sure you pick the right hero. Don't forget my recommendation: Phantom Assassin. She is absolutely the best. You will get ez kills and won't even have to bother about stunning the opponent - why stun when you can actually spill their guts inside out? Tell your soft support hero to gtfo from the lane as soon as possible, they're just milking your hard-earned XP by standing there.

With all this said, I am sure you will find Dota 2 community to be very respectful and friendly most of the times. Sometimes here and there you might run into a slightly unfriendly person but that's all just them being grumpy and unhappy with life - the good thing is: Now you have this guide to make that experience much less frequent as you will be killing it!

Enjoy!!!"

18523,"if i were to rate it id give it a 2.4/10, the game isnt really balanced, voice lines never function properly cutting each other off, there charecters arent really unique, like say phantom lancer, he makes illusions, thats his thing right? THEN WHY THE HELL DOES NAGA SIREN EXIST?! the graphics look.... bad, the community is so bad! but if i were to rate it on how fun it is WITH friends id give it a solid 7/10, alone it feels horrible, but the jank of playing with friends is too good!"

18705,"Dota is like doing hard drugs. It sucks you in and makes you feel like a god at times. At others, it spits you out and you hate everything and everyone and your soul gets a little chipped every time. In one moment you may have just double-killed the bot lane under their tower and still walked away with all 20 stick charges. In another, you might have to hold your headphones six inches off your ears so you don't go deaf from your team's screeching off one minor misplay. If you thought the bonds of friendship would protect you through a Dota game, you were wrong. You'll get better, but you'll never get good. Every person that plays this game is teetering on the edge of insanity, and all they need is for you to mess up one pull before they're pushed overboard. And they say they aren't, but they are, aren't they? You'll get better, but you'll never get good."

18733,"[h1] NOT RECOMMENDED [/h1]
It was a nice game a few years ago but recent changes have ruined the game for me. The community has become mostly toxic and the overwatch-system was a bad implementation in my opinion. In the past few months I've been getting overwatch-penalties every few games with an overall behavioural ananlysis count of >9000 which is said to be good, no quitting the match or griefing. The steam support and valve send you to reddit or other platforms to post your complaints but that doesn't help and the support is overall bad. Unless both the overwatch-system and the support get a serious overhaul I can't recommend this game to anyone who values their time."

I've tried all launch options and playing in a window the size of a gameboy color screen, still nothing.

DOTA is one of the most incredibly challenging games you'll ever come across, it can be highly rewarding and yet unbelievably frustrating at the same time.

It looks like Visual vomit, you legit can not tell whats going on 90% of fights, when its just farming its whatever, but theres so much shit going on in a fight that you lose track of whats going on, the mechanics and animations are clunky af, alot of the popular characters are just straight up not fun to play against cuz there is no counter play, it feels like a 2005 game and alot, if not most, of the characters have the design's that looks ""2005"", tho saying that, they do have some really good characters, dawnbreaker, witch doctor and hoodwink are really cool designs (in my opinion) but saying that, it doesnt take back from the rest of the game"

18909,ruined my life
18910,"This game is the Paroxysm of toxicity. 

I am 29, I played COD back when my mom was getting f*k by every 12 years old after every game, I've played LoL (wich is close second in toxicity) for years, I played pretty much every MMORPG in existence with all the trash talk that comes with it, I play apex alot with the raging coms etc... what I am saying is that I am not new to toxicity in games i've experienced it for years, and honestly, i don't mind it, its part of the game and I actually enjoy-find it funny to an extent. I was there when this game was born, back in WC3 and I have good memories of it.

But Dota 2 is something else, it is rotten.

So what is so bad about it?

1- 90% of games you will get thrash talkers in your game, Not the '' ahah i fk ur mom last night'' kind, no, the F*** Ret*** , mass pinging voice chat insulting type.

2-At any point of getting sh** on by some random guy cause; you missed a last hit, or didnt help him 1v5 when you knew you would both die or anything of the sort, IF you lash back out you will most likely get mass reported and banned for 20mins or more. So you can take insults but don't you dare talk back.

3-In ranked, ppl don't give a flying dog butt. They will pick a hard carry when they are support and steal last hits from you.  They will insult and ping spam you even if you are right and are doing your job.

4- You WILL get banned, Bad words after being insulted? Jungling because your support picked a hard carry and is stealing creeps? Just doing poorly cause you are new at a hero? Last hittign a creep as a support when you were trying to deny? Buying the ''wrong'' item? People report you for pretty much EVERY thing you do even when you are doing your best and not say ANYTHING. To the point where you will get scared out of playing.

5- People don't speak english. I am french, This is a team game, can we all speak english or select another server please? Dota is FILLED with what you will come to know as ''peruvians'' if you never met them yet you will, trust me.

6- DONOT, i repeat, DO NOT get off your seat while you are playing DOTA2, dog wants in? too bad, daughter crying? She better man up. your house is on fire? You better finish that game first boy, cause trust me, you'll be banned for griefing-leaving-afking 5 min before your house has burnt down.

In my last 20 games I think I've had 1 or 2 friendly players. 

Do not waste your time with this game my friends, ESPECIALLY if you are new, you will get banned and insulted into another another dimension,

Sorry for bad english, I am baguette French"

The only thing that will keep you going is that you need to log on to this god-forsaken game to get yelled at for an hour because you didn't watch BSJ's video telling you what hero to play and how to play it.

19006,"[b] DotA 2 is not for those who give up easily and are not willing to learn the necessary mechanics. [/b] This game is too complicated to learn everything overnight, by a week, or by a month. Even people like us, who have played this game for more than a decade, learn something every now and then. The game is so dynamic that some things that you knew a month ago can become obsolete in the next six months or so.

This game isn't easy, yet, it's also not that hard for anyone to master at least a portion of it. Most people who say that this game is easy can't even reach the Immortal rank. The challenge is surreal for those who want to improve and excel. Individual skills matter a lot, but you also have to be a team player. Add a little bit of luck, and you'll get wins."

If you have friends, that is really the best way to play the game.

If you mostly play solo, you must learn to deal with the bad days, sometimes bad weeks, sometimes even months. Winning is of course always more fun but I also find that during losing streaks, I can still focus on the individual plays and have fun in those moments. But sometimes taking a break, maybe an extended break is OK too, but if you like the game, you'll always come back to it. I know I did."

19063,"I've played this game since 2012 or 2013 and honestly I used to play almost nothing else. Although I've spent thousands of hours into it I can not recommend playing this game with friends in it's current state. Team ranked match making is saturated with smurfs, boosters, and to a lesser extent scripters/cheaters. Valve does not care or put any effort into cleaning up the game. The report system is a joke and the smurfs know this. It's exhausting playing 3 games in a row and having smurfs in every match. Almost not worth playing anymore."

19135,"What can I say about the game that has taken up more hours in my life than anything else? Dota is a mixed bag of awesome and awful. some of the best nights of gaming are because of it, and some of the worst.


Is it fun? absolutely* 

*you must get a party because public matches are ultra toxic

I've met some of my closest friends who I enjoy gaming with, I've been to weddings because of it, I've traveled the world and spend time with people who I met through Dota. That aspect is fantastic.

Gameplay is fun and short enough that if you need something to entertain you for a few hours or even 1, you can do that.

so what's the problem? 
The player community  is one of the most toxic I have ever been around. finding the  good people I did in this game is like finding another castaway lost at sea. you are both so relieved to have found another person amidst the awful that it gives you shared trauma,
Rampant racism, sexism, homophobia, toxic attitudes are in practically every game. 
Valve does very little to address this, so a small kid will be exposed to horrible things.
use the mute button often, and block players like you're breathing, and it may help, but probably not.

That said, once you do find some castaways who are fun to play with, it'll make it bearable, and your shared trauma will unite you for life. 

I made it through over 6500 hours playing this game, and I wouldn't have skipped it for the world"

19198,"TLDR: A convoluted mess of a MOBA. Maybe that's your thing, definitely not mine. It's #2 to League for a reason. Final Score: 6/10

I thought I would give this game a try since League of Legends has turned into a dash-fest, but Dota 2 turned out to be a bland, generic, convoluted mess of a game.

Pros:
-It's very pretty. 
-Some interesting ability ideas.
-The courier system is an interesting idea...with a few drawbacks.

Cons:
--CC everywhere. More roots, polymorphs, stuns, blinds, disarms than you can shake a stick at. You'll be lucky to be able to control your character at all. I thought Divinity Original Sin 2 had too many status effects, but this game is close behind it on the chart.

--Killing your own minions to ""deny"" the enemy gold? Seriously? What a ridiculous concept that takes the player out of the game. Can you imagine a battle where a commander starts murdering their own troops? More proof that DOTA just doesn't care about theme or immersion. Extra micro that becomes a chore.

--Generic and bland heroes (seriously, not even giving them names and instead calling them generic titles? Talk about a lack of creativity).

--Convoluted gameplay that is unnecessarily...messy. I don't fear complex games. I can sit down and play any Grand Strategy (Stellaris, Hoi4, EU4) for hours. But this, this is adding complexity without adding depth. Ten million tooltips and tiny details here and there. Do I need to know every effect of an ability for EVERY LEVEL? I can see putting the bonuses for leveling up said skill there, but why show previous level stats at all? Why are there multiple shops (especially since you can just send your courier there)? Why are there so many map capturables? Why can't characters see up on a ledge that looks perhaps half their height? 

--Listen, I don't mind a change of pace in the MOBA format. But I also don't want to spend an hour playing a single MOBA game. It's literally a point and click game genre when you break it down. People want quick fun, not a shallow game pretending to be as complex and fascinating as a 4X.

--The courier system adds unnecessary micro. Players in a MOBA should not be able to click off their hero at any time, nor have a need to. It's a MOBA not a RTS.

--The abilities are almost all click-target abilities that auto-hit. There's basically no skill involved. And since most abilities stun you for ridiculous periods of time, that means an enemy team can stun and trap you with basically zero effort.

--The eating trees thing is a little silly. They could just have made items that heal over time or something. Why destroy the trees too? 

--Too many holdovers from DOTA all-stars on Warcraft 3. I get it, it's a ""sequel"", but at least try to come up with some unique and new stuff.

Conclusion: It's impossible to not compare DOTA 2 and League of Legends. They are the top two MOBA games in the world, although League leads by nearly double the player base. DOTA 2 fans constantly complain about League of Legends hogging the spotlight of MOBA games. I was willing to give DOTA 2 a try since I can't stand League any more. Yet, League has twice the players of Dota 2 for a good reason: It has personality and is fun.

I won't claim League is remotely balanced or as complex as DOTA 2. It's a dash-fest mess that can be very frustrating. But at least I came away from League feeling like I had an interesting time rather than staring at a creatively-bankrupt game with pretty graphics (cough cough DOTA 2). I'll take my Vi, Jinx, Viktor heroes any day over generic Dragon Rider, Ice Mage, Assassin and Sniper, or whatever other stupid names and ideas DOTA 2 has for heroes. I don't even know what the world is called in DOTA 2. It has zero personality and zero effort. League's world is fascinating and varied with great lore and interesting heroes. 

Want a perfect example of how generic DOTA is compared to League? Just look at their animated shows. DOTA's show = ""Dragon's Blood"", a mediocre, generic fantasy show with forgettable characters. Not bad, but not great. League's show = Freaking ""Arcane"", considered by many to be one of the greatest animated series of all time (swept its Annie nominations). Yes, comparing their shows is a bit of a red herring, but it is connected to the world the games are trying to sell you. You develop a connection to League heroes. You never can develop that kind of connection to characters that Valve doesn't even bother to name properly.

Valve just copy-pasted the vast majority of their abilities and heroes from DOTA All-Stars on Warcraft 3 rather than coming up with new stuff (League is quite guilty of copy-pasting as well, but they copy-paste their own damn heroes, which might be worse, tbh).

My rant is over. DOTA 2 isn't horrible and is probably better for you if you want a long, unnecessarily complex MOBA to play. Some people prefer that. Fair enough. Personally, I like my MOBAs to be quick and fun. Not gonna go back to League, since it is a mess. Might play Smite or something instead.

19258,"If you are experienced in playing DOTA then I guess this game can be fun for you, however if you are new and starting solo, unless you are willing to put in hundreds of hours just in learning basics forget it. 

In my opinion every game has a learning curve however  this game has simply too complicated points that should not be that complicated but intuitive. For instance the shop. You cannot buy items in game that you want, receiving strange messages like you are not in range of the shop when you are right on top of it, or not being able to purchase what you want even if you have the gold for it, the confusion of the shop itself etc.

Evidently if you played this game from this start this is a non issue, however if you go solo now and you think you will just pick it up as you go along playing without any help from a friend, you are probably in for a stressful failure. 

In terms of design graphics and overall map movement and so forth, the game scores high in my opinion. It certainly would have the potential to have a much larger audience. The mechanics seem hard at start but certainly that part you can pick up, just in compassion with say League of Legends (in case you are coming from that game) you will find it impossible to select the correct items as the learning curve for that alone including how to purchase the items when you want and have the gold for them it is far too complicated and not intuitive at all. Plus it appears to have somekind of pool of items that can be shared which ofcourse going solo, learning that alone and coordenating that with randoms is near impossible. 

Say you have a mage and you can figure out what you want to buy, like intelligence, mana that sort of thing, but you get all kinds of stress just to buy the items themselves. It is frustrating as hell.

Again, I am not saying you cannot go on and learn it but if you think, Ok I know moba this is another moba game Ill pick it up easy, you wont. 

The champions are another issue, if you do not know the champions the icons on champion select are so tiny that even if you train a couple of champions, to identify that champion on the list of tiny tumbnails is already stressful. 

There is a mode for new players where you play against bots or whatever but there again all the shop rules and some purchase things are different, even to place a ward the map is too damm large in terms of gaps of hiding and trees so if you need cooperation for it. 

Even if your team is getting stumped and it is evident that you gone beyond the point of recovering, the game can take forever, with some experienced players plaguing normals with the solo aim to stump and get a million kills.

Again the question will be, are you willing to spend 1000 hours on it to have a game which is enjoyable, including watching a bunch of videos and so forth? If the answer is yes, then go for it. If the answer is no go play something else."

19288,"Waste of time and money, the game is very slow and generally last between 35-60 minutes. It's not a game for people that has things to do in their real life and also want a satisfied gaming experience. However on the other hand it's great for anyone want to ignore their responsibilities and simply waste their life on a video game, unless you are a pro and make money playing the game ofc. I've finally reached 5k mmr in US EAST. But now what, it's still the same game, same community that's generally toxic. Sure I am happy that I have proved myself I am actually good at this game, but it's not worth it considering the amount of time I have spent on it. 

Just walk away from it.. And yes I am talking to you whoever is reading this review behind the computer screen, do you really wanna waste your life on this game and spend thousands of hours to learn and improve at something that you will probably never be pro at it? My best suggestion for any new players is just don't get into it, unless you have literally nothing else to do in your life"

I get back on a day or two later and I am in low priority mode, meaning I have to play single draft and my que time got up to 6 minutes before I closed out.

19490,"""You learn how to learn, how to lose and most importantly you learn about you.""

Alright.... so here is my dota 2 review after playing almost 6000 hours over the span of 3 years.

1. general thoughts and how i started:
I was 15 when a friend recommended dota 2 to me. Back then i wouldnt ever have imagined how much time this game would take from me. At some point i was playing 12+ hours a day for weeks. Now im approaching my 19th birthday and im kind of conflicted on what kind of impact this game had on my life. I learned a lot about myself and generally speaking matured a lot regarding interacting with other humans. Dota isnt just a game, Dota is something else, something i have never experienced even when i was addicted to a mmorpg when i was 9-13. You learn how to learn, how to improve, how to win and how to lose. The most important thing dota teached me was how emotions impact your performance, and that saying ""nothing"" is sometimes the best thing to do. In real life no one really teaches you stuff like that since people are kind of used to dealing with emotional ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•.

2. Did i waste my youth?:
So this sounds a bit depressing but this is a thought that i had sometimes. but realisticially speaking, knowing myself, im really unsure of how much my life wouldve been different if i never started dota. I asume i wouldve been a bit further regarding social contacts but career/school-wise i highly doubt that it wouldve made a big difference. You gotta be realistic when thinking about stuff like this. Im not a very social guy. I dont like to put work into stuff i dont care about. The thoughts ""lets learn music"" or ""lets study"" wouldnt have EVER crossed my mind when i was 15. Im pretty sure if i wouldnt have started with dota i wouldve just been gooning around the city and abuse drugs, since thats a lot of fun to me. Back then i actually never even thought about working on something to improve, that whole dimension of ""improving"" wasnt even there for me. I just went to school got home and did fun stuff sometimes. Thats it. No goals. No aspiration, nothing. Dota changed that.

3. time invested into dota2:
EVERY dota player that has spent more than 1000 hours into this game has had that thought of ""oh man i shouldve learned something with this time.... i couldve been amazing now.."" at some point. But everyone is disregarding the fact that grinding dota is something VERY EASY and comfortable to do, unlike studying or learning an instrument. Just think about what kind of game dota 2 is that spending 1000s of hours is something you do with pleasure. It's kind of insane thinking about it. Once i started studying more for school again i realized how much ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô• time 100 hours is. I garantue you that you will be a top student if youd put 20 hours a week into studying outside of school. But the big difference is that dota is just so much more fun and REWARDING.

REWARDING: dota 2 is ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô• REWARDING. you learn a new hero -> BAMM MMR. you start understanding how to farm -> M . M . R

YOUR RANK GOES ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô• UP. IT FEELS AMAZING. at school you get an A and you smile for about 10 minutes and then youre back to being miserable. theres no punishment for being mediocre. At least thats how i feel right now and im graduating this year(grades are OK(kinda good, not great)).

ReasoN I WROTE THIS: im downloading dota right now because my laptop is REALLY ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô• up adn deletes files something, so i needed something to do



CONCLUSION: AMAZING GAME, EATS ALL YOUR TIME, YOU WILL HAVE FUN(if you are competetive)

19493,This is a great game. The game has evolved a lot since its introduction in DOTA 1. There are so many more mechanics now than before. I would recommend gamers to try this game out as it is really fun and challenging. Furthermore it allows anyone to play it completely free without being disadvantaged to those who invest money to purchase bundles and skins. This is truly a game of skill and not a game of money.

19576,"This is what I have to say about modern DOTA.

If you are starting a new account your best bet in to get good with bots, you will learn good builds with the 2 free months of DOTA PLUS, and learn some basics before you face people. Once you start facing people the trouble in modern DOTA 2 begins. Any USA server you will not find a game before 11 am EST, even when you can find a game expect at least half your games to be full of intentional leavers or feeders. Your chat privelages are completely based on a ""behavior"" score.  I personally claimed 6 commends and less than 3 reports in my first 15 games on this account. My chat privelages were removed when my first behavior score report came through and was below 3000. Once this happens to new players don't expect to ask your teammates questions about builds, or heroes to play, or strats, it seems that aspect of DOTA has been lost anyway.

You will find many people with starting accounts are also muted. The people who are not muted either are also new accounts or people with similar behavior score. Every once in a while the unmuted players will contribute to help you. Mostly though they will either troll about how they are dominating or more likely tell you how bad you are and threaten to report you. The first sentance that shows in chat before every unranked game is telling people to be understanding and patient with new players. It seems nobody takes this sentence serious. 

Don't get me wrong this review is very biased. I had one account in high standing in this game and played for years, after release,  without problems. When i took a couple years without playing, then came back to the game, I showed up extremely rusty and trying to figure out a completely new META. On this new account I have played just as bad as when I was rusty. Years ago you would get mass reported for feeding, even when you argued to the people reporting that you were rusty and trying to get back into the game. It falls into the category of unintentional feeding, like any new player can fall victim too.

This games ranking system is very much based off the Indian caste system. I wonder if that is what they are trying to apply to the entire community of the game. There seems to be two different sets of rules in this game. Those based on the EULA you accept before playing each game and those based on the ""communities"" reports. When you give the community the ability to essentially cancel culture peoples investment into this game it causes problems imo. Most of these reports are completely illegitamate or with little cause.

Overall id recommend the game but thats like asking a drug addict if they enjoy the high, they cant escape it. Welcome to dota 2, your life is now over."
19672,"I've been playing this game since 2014.

The years when MOBA games were big were certainly great times. After doing your homework, you'd fire up your PC, meet your friends on TeamSpeak and play some games. Some had their favorite hero picks and kept playing the same hero over and over trying to perfect their strats while other tried many different heroes on different positions with different items.
Everything seemed to be viable.

You'd meet players from the whole continent. I've met people coming from nothern countries such as sweden or norway; people coming from spain or malta, as well as people coming from russia.
While everyone grew up in a different culture and speaking a different language, everyone had the same goal: 
Have fun with a good round of dota.

Having fun didn't necessarily mean easy sailing winning every game. No, the game was supposed to be balanced (in terms of the skill level each player possesed) and most of the time a toe to toe race. That's how the game has been.

Sadly, those days are over.

These days a game of DotA looks like this: 

You come home from uni lectures, start a game with two of your friends of similar rank. After waiting up to 15 minutes to find a match you find yourself in either of four scenarios:
- Everyone has a similar rank like you and your friends; Outcome: you have a balanced-out game.
- The enemy team is generally lower ranked; Outcome: you stomp the game.
- The enemy team is lower ranked but there is this one player, that supposedly started playing two weeks ago and has miraculously already mastered DotA. Outcome: you get stomped.
- The enemy team is higher ranked, where one or more players of high rank (in my case they're legend - divine) play with their low rank (guardian - crusader) friends. Outcome: Surprise, surprise, the high ranking player solo stomps the game.

At this point, the game is already determined to some degree before even picking a single hero.


The scale are then further tipped in the draft, that is seemingly dominated by the same heroes: Tiny, Primal Beast, Huskar, Pudge, Sniper or Axe. It feels nearly impossible to get a game without these heroes being in it. Other options are just not viable anymore because they don't like to fight early or they don't farm as fast as a Luna or Medusa.


Your fate is now further sealed in the first ~15 minutes of the game, it seems. Either team is getting crushed on lane without having the chance to recover because there is a fucking Tiny with 500 damage at minute 15 destroying your base in two hits.

In the end you sit in front of your PC - 15 minutes into the game - that you'll loose this game. You're not allowed to give up or you'll get punished. Instead you're supposed to defend your base until the enemy team finally decides to grant you the coup de grace. 

*TL;DR / Summary*:
The game used to be fun, but is now stuck in a very static meta and a matchmaking system that gets regularly abused either by smurfs or high ranking players playing with their low ranking players.

The outcome of a game is now determined within the first 15 minutes while your stuck another 20 minutes either sieging or defending.

Also, if you are a beginner, don't bother picking up this game. It is dying and is only held up by people seeking distraction during corona lockdown and people creating smurf accounts."
19673,"the most important question is, is it fun?
Yes and No.

Yes if you play with your friends and casually game or aim for competitions which make bonding with friends more enjoyable.
No if you're playing solo then this game can really give you a bad time, talking to you SEA server."

19716,"Dota 2 is a highly complex game that requires an elevated thought process which is sadly not inherent to many of the kids who play this game today. For this reason the game has often been wrongly classified as toxic. Dota 2 however is not toxic. Rather it is a game filled with a group of passionate players who find it quite frustrating when they are matched with players who refuse to take the time to learn the basics of the game and the hero roles.
For this reason I strongly suggest that the game developers ban the solo queue option from the game thus allowing players play collectively as a team thus improving the game-play experience."

20031,"DotA 2 is like a good game of chess that has done acid and decided to invite all of its 'friends' over to brutalize and torment the other team. However, instead of tormenting the other team these 'friends' just decide to rail on one another until each 'friend' has to quietly put themselves into offline mode before playing any game on steam.

Honestly though, contrary to popular opinion DotA is a very fun game. It is just not a fun game for stupid people or people that are not willing to take some time to learn the game. This game will not spoonfeed you on how to play, nor will it easily allow you to catch up if you make mistakes. Like in the real world if you make mistakes in battle you will suffer.

A few tips: 
Try to keep a level head, and bonus points for a positive attitude. Your team will appreciate it a lot, and they will be more willing to work with you.
Pay attention to the map, your surroundings, and your enemies items. 
Read your abilities carefully, read the patch notes, read the items abilities.
Practice heroes in demo mode (this is different from bot practice or private lobby.)
Get yourself a mic. Effective communication is one of your biggest utilities.
If a hero that is in your lane goes missing call missing immediately. Better safe than sorry.
Buy wards. Wards might typically be a supports 'job', but they will save your life and get you kills, which will easily make up for the gold cost. Also, your team will appreciate you that much more, which will result in them being much more likely to try to help you out and listen to you.
Use your scan. I find that this tool is way overlooked. At least in my bracket. It's up every 5 minutes, and it can only help (if not to tell you where someone is; it will tell you where they are not.)
Nobody is good at DotA. There is always someone much better than you are. So do your best and try not to talk trash. 
Treat this as a chance to develop team communication skills
Deny creeps as much as you can, but not at the sacrifice of missing a last hit.
Buy smoke before a gank or a Rosh kill. They are a cheap invaluable tool.
Verbally tell whomever you are around if you are planning on leaving them or TPing out. 
Experiment with different items when you are fighting different types of heroes.
I say this last one with caution because it can hinder your ability to play the game normally, but try Turbo when you first start out. It will allow you to learn heroes more quickly.
Okay, actually this is my last point. Try to have fun. It is just a game.

Kaz"

20060,"I started played this game from frozen throne and honestly I cant imagine how far it had come to. Althought, the toxicity is there everywhere in Dota2, but thats what made it fun."
20061,"Low Priority queue is actually the fucking stupidest, worst punishment I've ever seen in a video game.

This game has one of the most autistic, rude, awful communities I've ever seen. A bunch of basement dwellers that think spamming KEKW and being a 4channer is a replacement for having a personality. I played league for over a decade before switching to DOTA2. Smite I've played for a long time but it just was badly designed and balanced I gave up. There's really no other competition for mobas

It's a legit way better balanced and designed game than any of its competition. But the community is also thirty times more toxic/infuriating than LoL or Smite. At least those game let you surrender a match everyone agrees is over. This one you have to suffer and waste another 30 minutes to play out a game you have no hope of winning because your team refuses to communicate and your 2 cores are a cumulative 2/30. So you get to be target practice for a team that refuses to end the game because they want to boost their egos and K/D's. Refusing to participate or sitting in spawn gets you put in ""low priority queue"" as mentioned above. Which is a punishment that rewards good players that are toxic above players who are mechanically bad but committed the same crimes.

Low Priority queue is a system that puts you in longer queues (upwards of 10 minutes for a game) limits you to one mode (single pick, where you get s choice of one of three characters you probably won't know how to play if you're a new player) and the punishment isn't based on behavior or number of games, or a flat time, it's based on number of wins. win a lot of games and it's a minor inconvenience, if you aren't good at the game (like me) you'll never get out and be stuck for months. Good players learn nothing for their trouble and bad players are overly punished for doing the exact same thing the other players did. 

Since people are already being punished, no one cares in low priority queue. I've had people openly admit to feeding while being disgusting and burping on the mic because they lack social awareness. I've had people autolock characters that make no sense for the comp. I've had teammates and enemies alike just walk into the enemy team on cooldown. People still ragequit and even if it's a 4 vs 5 you're not allowed to leave in low priority queue, and the wins only count if all players are present so you're doing it for nothing at that point. It's the worst punishment I've ever seen. It teaches misbehaving players all the wrong lessons and it's a system that's been in place for years.Once you're stuck, if you're not good at the game you're just stuck in there for months and can't get out. I actually really really enjoy the depth of the game mechanically but I've been stuck in low prio queue for months now. Because I left some unwinnable games that went on for almost an hour.

So for those of you stepping in, the game is absurdly hard, the community sucks, and if you leave like three games EVER because there's no surrender system and people don't like ending games when they're ahead because THEY'RE having fun, the game gets even WORSE. and no one will have any sympathy for you, simply spamming ""haha you suck lmao KEKW get good"" while the other team runs a train on you for not knowing how to play."

Even if the essence is the same, you will not play two identical games because each game of DOTA is unique.
 If you like chess, definately this is the game for you, because you have to think you moves before you act.
Overall, it is a great game, a master piece which combine elements from history  and more.

20112,"after spending roughly 5000 hours in this game and literally playing it since it was a warcraft 3 custom map I will write a very biased review of what I came to believe was a game concept. I will briefly sum up a few good qualities of the game as well as the not so great features.

THE GOOD: 
1. Dota2 is an amazingly diverse game, given the fact that there are approx 120 different heroes. You can make insane combinations of skills just based on hero picks into a visual ecstasy that will give you a good laugh and nice memories.
2. The learning curve is mega hard and to become somewhat effective you will lose at least a few hundred games. The game allows you to practice with AI bots that are fairly well designed, but once you realize their behaviour/programming pattern,they become way too easy to beat even on hardest difficulty. These AI matches will give you a great foothold on the mechanics of the game to build your skill upon.
3. Dota2 is progressing and new heroes/items are being added continually. As well as nearly quarterly special game modes, this allows for a somewhat enjoyable experience.

THE BAD:
1. Matchmaking abuse is a thing that you will see on a daily basis. You get smurf players (accounts of players who have lot more experience in the game get paired with much lower). This can not be evaded as people are getting banned and suspended left and right. However, losing because 1 of your 3 lanes gets facerolled is not enjoyable at all and you can do very little about it.
2. Matchmaking pairs - the algorithm for matchmaking was probably designed by a guy who is drunk and high for the most part of his life and at this point the company just does not want to fire him. I can only speak from experience but let me tell you that being paired with people who have 200 matches as someone with 4000 games is nowhere near pleasant and happens way too often. 
3. In game communication is close to impossible unless you are lucky with who you get paired with. Most of the time you just mute everyone and try to play the game as intended. Let me tell you I have said and wrote some nasty shit in there that would result in violence for sure.

THE UGLY:
1. People. Simple as that.

SUMMARY: try this game. kill things when their life is low. shout in the mic why are you getting ganked without anyone saying anything. smoke gank their team and destroy one of the towers. sneak in the roshan pit for that sweet sweet aegis. get shit on by a smurf tinker (insert any current overpowered meta hero) mid. uninstall. play something else for a few weeks. install dota again and spend more of your time. CONGRATULATIONS! The cycle is complete."

20183,"Just like any other game like this it draws you in and slowly sucks away your free time. Lots of fun, like league of legends except items/builds matter 100x more. Fun champions. Like any game of this kind the community is toxic. Also if you can't speak spanish you probably won't be able to communicate with 75% of the playerbase. Games are not server based, language based, or location based. You can meet a lot of fun people but it also causes lots of issues. I've had games where I've played with a Russian player, a Chinese player, a Columbian player, and one other English speaker on my team. Other than the other random english speaker not a single one of us could communicate with each other. It also led to our main carry d/cing every 4 minutes because their connection was not strong enough to play with people so far away. Our team got destroyed. In a game that has no forfeit function (which in many ways is a positive thing) games like this can drag on with most being ~40 minutes but can vary from 25-60+ minutes. As you can imagine being trapped in a game like that ends up with you just waiting for the enemy team to destroy your base. Until they fix it so people with similar connections play with each other the game is just going to feel like an incomplete League of Legends knock off."

20197,"Been playing for 9 years. I used to play WC3 Dota, then I switched to LoL then when Dota 2 came out I switched to it and stayed. The one main contrast that appeals to me about Dota 2 is that the hero roles aren't fixed. You can play any hero anywhere and make it work as long as you know how to farm gold and exp. You can play melee against ranged and still win the lane which is impossible in some games. The item builds aren't streamlined either. You can build a lot of wacky and fun items and be creative. Also, supports are not useless either and when played properly can create a huge impact and not be completely dependent on the carry or core. One time my carry abandoned and I built carry items on my support and won the game. It's as you mentioned. Freedom is the main appeal of the game. At first, it may seem daunting and confusing but when you start getting the hang of it you really start enjoying the amount of space the game gives to apply your own unique strategy every game."

20199,"Disregard all of the paragraph below, I was using ""Dota 2 Test"" from being part of alpha/beta test 10 years ago, awesome game.




Can't play multiplayer because of an anti-cheat error with Valve. I've tried everything suggested. The last remaining thing in the support suggestions is to uninstall ccleaner, the most common cache cleaner for private use. I don't care if that is it, I'm not uninstalling the best programs for maintaining a healthy pc just so you can run apparently poorly mobilized anti cheat program.

The bot matches are fun at least, nostalgic and I feel like I'm playing Warcraft 3 again."

The people that play this game are nothing but sub-human troglodytes and I wish you all death, the amount of Russians I see on EU-West is astonishing to the point when you're surprised when you get a normal person who doesn't speak that italic parseltongue. 

Apart from those cretins you've got the crackheads who do nothing in their life except smoke meth and make their names edgy to look for sympathy in the DoTA community of all places. They also find it funny to make the same British joke over and over again, if anything it just shows how stagnant their brain development was. Sell your level 200+ DoTA account to someone and reconsider your life choices you waste of sperm.

Also DoTA being a very toxic community has some of the most moist people on the planet who just fucking whinge every time you ping the floor next to them and just feed for the next 50 minutes thinking i'm going to say sorry to them. In addition to that its always the fucking British that are the most jarring as they just taint the British culture with their pseudo twitch vocabulary which just makes them look fucking disabled, if you're from Surrey or Eton I don't want to hear you speak you inbred Neanderthals.

Other than that if you see me on this game don't ask me to play because 1) I don't like you. 2) Do something more productive in your life.

Edit 2 : How can people lose games when they are so ahead the other team literally doesn't touch their keyboard, for some fucking reason I had some Chinese 4 man queue with me and they were so bad its was unreal, when you try to talk to these apes their mics are so fucking bad, they sound like they're in the 1940's being invaded by Japan literal shells hitting their homes, you'd think its some sort of Chinese mind controlling technique by trying to blow my fucking ears out. I think the Chinese should stop sending muslims to camps and send these communist mongs there instead. I'll be back soon to update this more"

20371,"The game used to be fun til you get put on teams with toxic bullies who have obviously had a bad day so decide to go online and try to gob off at anyone they game with.

Pair that with the fact you get reported for not reading peoples minds through a computer game and not doing what they expect you to do that 1/100th of a millisecond in time else they will rage.

Then marry those reports to the fact your behaviour score goes down and down til you are then matched with only toxic teammates who report you for literal nothing but Valve doesn't care about that so takes more behaviour score from you to put you with the cesspit of toxic ass players.

Whats next you ask? Well you mute everybody then they still report you for not being a mind reader and then Valve slaps you with random 4 hour bans.

Being the largest and most immediately open MOBA, with Valve showcasing its talent for rewarding and fostering a community, it demands and offers more than literally any game I can think of. It's almost more comparable to basketball than most commercial games. Something utterly opaque bearing no endgame, but that could happily fill every waking second of your life."

In ranked matches below 2k mmr you will have someone on the team who doesnt speak english, someone who laggs, someone who insults you on other languages and calls you mf noob dog or something and the enemy team always has a smurf or a spammer.

In general the attitude of the community is toxic and if you have an unstable personality I suggest stay away from it."

20741,"It is less of a game and more of DSM-IV simulator, generally everybody on your ""team"" has some mental problem.
I recommend ""playing"" if you want to conduct some type of psychological study on various neurosis or anti-social behavior traits, otherwise it is not actually a fun experience.
The player lies to themselves thinking they have fun, but even winning is not fun, simply because you repeat the same mechanics as every other time while trying to evade somebody's ego collapses and their id runs rampant.

I would advise everybody to avoid ever playing this, because the only times it was ever fun was playing with friends, and since everybody has moved on ther eis nothing to be had. High stress experience designed to play on you dopamine responses, toxic individuals that only become more toxic as they continue to play, it is free so guess what type of people it attracts.

If you are trying to leave gaming and may start thinking you're addicted, then STAY AWAY! This is one of the best games I've played in my life and I can't stop coming back, even though I now have a job, wife and kid now. If you like ranked gameplay, the players at the bottom ranks can be a bit toxic, but as you climb, the players are nicer. The strategy and skill required can be demanding, but there are plenty of coaches and video tutorials on how to get better on the web. The graphics, game design, music and voice dialogues are great. Again, highly addictive gameplay, different game modes, huge community, but big time eater. Approach with caution! :)"

20850,"This game is broken and imbalanced. I'm not talking about the champions, but the map. Just like League of legends, the map does not rotate to fit whatever side you are on, so when you are on the top (dire) side of the map, you have a significant sight disadvantage. Allowing the map to rotate 45 degrees or 90 degrees would solve this problem, but valve will not do it. Same with LOL. Many players who think they are smart will defend this choice (even though it would be harmless to implement as an option) saying that you should just more your camera appropriately. But the camera sees a trapezoid area since it is at an angle. No matter what position you have your camera set to, you will always see more area at the top of the screen than on the lower, and enemy players can are more likely to catch you off guard when approaching from below. In addition, the HUD takes up a significant portion of the bottom of the screen, further exacerbating the problem. The result is a near 60/40 win ration between sides favoring the radiant (lower) side. If your team loses the coin toss and you are placed at the top of the map on the dire side, you are playing at a significant disadvantage.

Many modern MOBAs recognize this problem and correct for it. Heroes of the Storm has symmetrical maps where players sides are on the left and the right, not bottom left vs top right. And Pokemon Unite literally flips the map so that you as a player always spawn on the left side of the map and always fight players to the right. 

It would be simple to program an option into the game to rotate the map. People can actually use cheats to accomplish this, so it would be simple to add the code in the options to allow players to do this, but for some reason they wont do it. I once met a former Riot employee who said that the reason riot wont fix this issue is out of a stubborn pride, and that mentioning it in meetings is basically forbidden. I have a feeling that Valve is the same way. Instead, you just eye rolls from valve and pretentious players saying ""learn to position the camera right bro, I did it, see how amazing I am?"" Fine if that is your approach, you do you. But allow us the option to flip the map. If you want to play handicapped, that's your choice. At least give us the choice to play our way. 

If you think radiant and dire side are actually even, then why not put your money where you mouth is and give us the option to always spawn on the radiant side? If there is no advantage, it wont harm anyone will it? But you know the radiant has an advantage and players would always choose radiant to get the edge on the enemy players. 

Its literally no skin off your nose to implement a map rotate option, the possibility is already in there in the code, so just let us do it. 

Until then, I wont be playing this game, which is a shame. I want to play this game. I would even be willing to spend alot of money on skins and dota plus, but not until its an even playing field. I don't like playing games that are unfair. Simple as that."

20917,"Abaddon, the Lord of Avernus

The Font of Avernus is the source of a family's strength, a crack in primal stones from which vapors of prophetic power have issued for generations. Each newborn of the cavernous House Avernus is bathed in the black mist, and by this baptism they are given an innate connection to the mystic energies of the land. They grow up believing themselves fierce protectors of their lineal traditions, the customs of the realm‚Äîbut what they really are protecting is the Font itself. And the motives of the mist are unclear.

When the infant Abaddon was bathed in the Font, they say something went awry. In the child's eyes there flared a light of comprehension that startled all present and set the sacerdotes to whispering. He was raised with every expectation of following the path all scions of Avernus took‚Äîto train in war, that in times of need he might lead the family's army in defense of the ancestral lands. But Abaddon was always one apart. Where others trained with weapons, he bent himself to meditation in the presence of the mist. He drank deep from the vapors that welled from the Font, learning to blend his spirit with the potency that flowed from far beneath the House; he became a creature of the black mist.

There was bitterness within the House Avernus‚Äîelders and young alike accusing him of neglecting his responsibilities. But all such accusations stopped when Abaddon rode into battle, and they saw how the powers of the mist had given him mastery over life and death beyond those of any lord the House had ever known."

21012,"Took awhile getting used to it having come from an era of DOTA 1, Too much grief from battle.net and public servers n all.  Its a good replacement. There are constant balancing, reworks, and map changes occasionally, So you will need to adapt here and there, New heros get released every now and again, which is good.

Good game-play, plays well on Linux without any layers, Takes awhile to get used to but so does everything.

Default guides are fairly useful for heros, Better than nothing.

All in all, Ruin your life simulator. 
10/10 would recommend if you are trying to kill yourself.
Causes anxiety problems, low self esteem, Tourette's syndrome, mood swings, Bipolar disorder, breakdown of relationships, raging erections, racism.
If you are worried your children are doing drugs, show them this game. They will be too busy fulfilling their innermost masochistic desires while hopelessly right clicking that they will not have the time for drugs or friends or anything else really.

Pros:
- You will learn Russian
- You will learn Spanish
- You will learn Pinoy

For what cost?
- Your friendship 
- Your time
- Your family
- Your life"

About reporting players who ruins game for other's should be a punishment that can force them to not do this action again 
there is so many of them in ranked match making causing lose easily.

as player who gets harassed much from them, i suggest to when a report of ranked matchmaking accepted the guilty player should lose more MMR maybe 4x and this MMR given to the other players of the team who not deserve losing. 
i think this will lead them to play more seriously and stop them from ruining other ones game"

wen i did my first game to get rank i was archon, now im the lowest braked cause im over and over beeing griefed and blocked by ego players that feel very pro and full os shit at 2k mmr. griefing all game long and beeing deruptive to the comunity.

21096,"I played all 3 of the major MOBA's (league, dota and smite), and I do not recommend DOTA because the game is simply too unnecessarily complex its ridiculous... And no this is not a ""too hard"" complaint, Chess is a hard game yet it isn't nearly as complex as DOTA. You don't need to add a thousand of different mechanics, active items, couriers and what not to make the game hard... In DOTA, you will use every button on your keyboard and as a new player have 1 billion things to learn about, I just don't think its worth for a video game. You might as well go to university and take your bachelor degree with the time you would spend learning DOTA. 

Oh and, most characters are ugly for no reason which put me away. There are a few cool ones like Abaddon and Phantom Assassin, but most of the roster is just La Creatura but in different coolors"

21159,"I just don‚Äôt get you.

You started out life

as a Warcraft III mod,

created by some dude

by the name of IceFrog.



Now DOTA 2,

look at you!

Most played on Steam,

you‚Äôre living the dream,

But I‚Äôm afraid I still don‚Äôt get you.



My friends are all hooked

to this five on five game.

But every time I play

it still feels like the same.



‚ÄúMid, Top, and Bottom,‚Äù

I soon hear them shout,

But I‚Äôm still picking a hero

and left to pout.



A chosen hero

is a nightmare proposition,

with over 100 choices

from Zeus to the Ancient Apparition.



The heroes of the Radiant

and beasts of the Dire

locked in eternal struggle

with no one the wiser.



The Sniper, The Tinker,

and the great Earthshaker

battle the evil forces

of the Warlock and Spirit Breaker.



I learn about Farming, Laning

Nuking and Ganking.

Feeding our foes

and lessening our woes.

But it‚Äôs already too late,

a high level Luna

has sealed our fate.



DOTA 2,

It‚Äôs not you it‚Äôs me

That can‚Äôt figure out

to use a Tango on a tree.



I do as I‚Äôm told

and stick to my lane,

but soon myself stunned

by the Fiend‚Äôs Grip of Bane.



The agony of screams

and smashing of keyboard

soon follows suit

after the Meepo horde.



My perilously shortened life

has become a catalog of strife;

between Batrider‚Äôs fires,

Broodmother‚Äôs spiders,

and Ursa‚Äôs furious swipes

causing entire team wipes.

Related: Street Fighter x Mega Man Review


When heroes clash

in defense of their ancients

all my training is drained

as is my patience.



Ghosts and serpents

and rivers of lava

deprive me of ever

becoming braver

to face the demons

that march at me

instead of running back

to eat a tree.



DOTA 2,

I just don‚Äôt get you.

‚ÄúIt gets better,‚Äù

my enthralled friends plead,

‚ÄúJust give it more time!‚Äù

But I‚Äôm having more fun

coming up with a rhyme.

‚ÄúWelcome to DOTA, You Suck‚Äù

21183,pro
21184,"just got into the game fun and not to crazy movements (you can visually see everything that happens unlike other games that are similar but more fast paced.)  

the con..... mostly the players as they randomly drop if your team is winning, if your team is loosing they stay idle and no ai to replace dropt players, no surrender option (their is one but wont allow you 99% of the time) also if you choose to surrender instead of just dropping the penalty is extremely harsh to those that actually play the whole match as it dose not count as a completed match so you have to win a whole match to remove any penalty (extremely hard for new players not to familiar with the game). As for the heroes....... many of them feel and play hella  broken or it might just be in my head, and their are many that fall behind when trying to keep up with other heroes the items help them a bit.  

gist of the story i dont recommend this game to people with anger issue as this game might have you pop a vain, or to new people. If you hunger for pvp and can solo 5 people on your own i recommend this game to you."

Will we pick ourjob today?

  
I heard it's just orientation.

  
Heads up! Here we go.

  
Keep your hands and antennas
inside the tram at all times.

  
- Wonder what it'll be like?
- A little scary.

  
Welcome to Honex,
a division of Honesco

  
and a part of the Hexagon Group.

  
This is it!

  
Wow.

  
Wow.

  
We know that you, as a bee,
have worked your whole life

  
to get to the point where you
can work for your whole life.

  
Honey begins when our valiant Pollen
Jocks bring the nectar to the hive.

  
Our top-secret formula

  
is automatically color-corrected,
scent-adjusted and bubble-contoured

  
into this soothing sweet syrup

  
with its distinctive
golden glow you know as...

  
Honey!

  
- That girl was hot.
- She's my cousin!

  
- She is?
- Yes, we're all cousins.

  
- Right. You're right.
- At Honex, we constantly strive

  
to improve every aspect
of bee existence.

  
These bees are stress-testing
a new helmet technology.

  
- What do you think he makes?
- Not enough.

  
Here we have our latest advancement,
the Krelman.

  
- What does that do?
- Oatches that little strand of honey

  
that hangs after you pour it.
Saves us millions.

  
Oan anyone work on the Krelman?

  
Of course. Most bee jobs are
small ones. But bees know

  
that every small job,
if it's done well, means a lot.

  
But choose carefully

  
because you'll stay in the job
you pick for the rest of your life.

  
The same job the rest of your life?
I didn't know that.

  
What's the difference?

  
You'll be happy to know that bees,
as a species, haven't had one day off

  
in 27 million years.

  
So you'll just work us to death?

  
We'll sure try.

  
Wow! That blew my mind!

  
""What's the difference?""
How can you say that?

  
One job forever?
That's an insane choice to have to make.

  
I'm relieved. Now we only have
to make one decision in life.

  
But, Adam, how could they
never have told us that?

  
Why would you question anything?
We're bees.

  
We're the most perfectly
functioning society on Earth.

  
You ever think maybe things
work a little too well here?

  
Like what? Give me one example.

  
I don't know. But you know
what I'm talking about.

  
Please clear the gate.
Royal Nectar Force on approach.

  
Wait a second. Oheck it out.

  
- Hey, those are Pollen Jocks!
- Wow.

  
I've never seen them this close.

  
They know what it's like
outside the hive.

  
Yeah, but some don't come back.

  
- Hey, Jocks!
- Hi, Jocks!

  
You guys did great!

  
You're monsters!
You're sky freaks! I love it! I love it!

  
- I wonder where they were.
- I don't know.

  
Their day's not planned.

  
Outside the hive, flying who knows
where, doing who knows what.

  
You can'tjust decide to be a Pollen
Jock. You have to be bred for that.

  
Right.

  
Look. That's more pollen
than you and I will see in a lifetime.

  
It's just a status symbol.
Bees make too much of it.

  
Perhaps. Unless you're wearing it
and the ladies see you wearing it.

  
Those ladies?
Aren't they our cousins too?

  
Distant. Distant.

  
Look at these two.

  
- Oouple of Hive Harrys.
- Let's have fun with them.

  
It must be dangerous
being a Pollen Jock.

  
Yeah. Once a bear pinned me
against a mushroom!

  
He had a paw on my throat,
and with the other, he was slapping me!

  
- Oh, my!
- I never thought I'd knock him out.

  
What were you doing during this?

  
Trying to alert the authorities.

  
I can autograph that.

  
A little gusty out there today,
wasn't it, comrades?

  
Yeah. Gusty.

  
We're hitting a sunflower patch
six miles from here tomorrow.

  
- Six miles, huh?
- Barry!

  
A puddle jump for us,
but maybe you're not up for it.

  
- Maybe I am.
- You are not!

  
We're going 0900 at J-Gate.

  
What do you think, buzzy-boy?
Are you bee enough?

  
I might be. It all depends
on what 0900 means.

  
Hey, Honex!

  
Dad, you surprised me.

  
You decide what you're interested in?

  
- Well, there's a lot of choices.
- But you only get one.

  
Do you ever get bored
doing the same job every day?

  
Son, let me tell you about stirring.

  
You grab that stick, and you just
move it around, and you stir it around.

  
You get yourself into a rhythm.
It's a beautiful thing.

  
You know, Dad,
the more I think about it,

  
maybe the honey field
just isn't right for me.

  
You were thinking of what,
making balloon animals?

  
That's a bad job
for a guy with a stinger.

  
Janet, your son's not sure
he wants to go into honey!

  
- Barry, you are so funny sometimes.
- I'm not trying to be funny.

  
You're not funny! You're going
into honey. Our son, the stirrer!

  
- You're gonna be a stirrer?
- No one's listening to me!

  
Wait till you see the sticks I have.

  
I could say anything right now.
I'm gonna get an ant tattoo!

  
Let's open some honey and celebrate!

  
Maybe I'll pierce my thorax.
Shave my antennae.

  
Shack up with a grasshopper. Get
a gold tooth and call everybody ""dawg""!

  
I'm so proud.

  
- We're starting work today!
- Today's the day.

  
Oome on! All the good jobs
will be gone.

  
Yeah, right.

  
Pollen counting, stunt bee, pouring,
stirrer, front desk, hair removal...

  
- Is it still available?
- Hang on. Two left!

  
One of them's yours! Oongratulations!
Step to the side.

  
- What'd you get?
- Picking crud out. Stellar!

  
Wow!

  
Oouple of newbies?

  
Yes, sir! Our first day! We are ready!

  
Make your choice.

  
- You want to go first?
- No, you go.

  
Oh, my. What's available?

  
Restroom attendant's open,
not for the reason you think.

  
- Any chance of getting the Krelman?
- Sure, you're on.

  
I'm sorry, the Krelman just closed out.

  
Wax monkey's always open.

  
The Krelman opened up again.

  
What happened?

  
A bee died. Makes an opening. See?
He's dead. Another dead one.

  
Deady. Deadified. Two more dead.

  
Dead from the neck up.
Dead from the neck down. That's life!

  
Oh, this is so hard!

You might come into this game, being all happy and adventurous-like. And your first couple of games might be fun. 

THEN BOOM. Out of nowhere, smurfs, degenerates that won't play the game and of course the infamous manchild. 
""I didn't get to play exactly like i want to, so now i'm angry, and even though i'm feeding it's everyone elses fault"" 

Despite all this, it will have you coming back for more,  you will convince yourself that next game will be different. 
You'll be hopeful until you hit the final stage: Despair Enjoyer mode. You've become numb at this point, all you can think about is the next game. It will take your sleep away, your joy of life. 

The only thing you'll start looking forward to is breaking your damn loss spree, encountering human beings and neither are likely to happen.

21334,why me with 2600 hours of playing this game should match with a person who just downloaded the game either in ranked or unranked games. i hate dota matchmaking why they dont look at players experiences and ranks to match them together this way everybody enjoys the game and nobody insult nobody else for being bad player.
21335,"Transferred from LoL to here, I'd only suggest this game if you use your mute settings or generally ignore chat/voice comms. It can be just as toxic! I have met very friendly, great people who gave respectful advice and help to better use your heroes; there's also the handy coaching feature. It was a steeper learning curve (They've added a simpler shop set up you can change to like I did) less strict lanes, but overall nicer gameplay.
I recommend hopping over if you are on the fence about supporting riot games or pretty done with the other battle arena titles"

Valve doesnt care about the community at all.. and hasnt since i started playing. 
No matter how long you play you will not get anywhere in solo queue,, sure you might rank up a time or two.. then its all gone due to toxicity or smurfs.. neither of which valve will do anything about. I'm not going to even get into the lack of being able to communicate with your team because for whatever reason they havent decided to let you choose a language for your team.. oh wait. you speak english? sorry about you.. here's 4 players with 3 different languages with 200+ ping waiting to lose the game while they spam the chat in gibberish haha gg wp"

21415,Awful shop with items mixed everywhere without a good possibility to find something. Dota 1 (Warcraft 3 version) had a way better item management in shops. The visuals of items are bad and it is very difficult for a new player to pick this game up. The differences between Dota 1 and Dota 2 are way too high.

The UI is a huge upgrade, But the art of it all is a massively fatally horrific downgrade. --The sound effects can clearly be heard as someone's failed mouth sounds at explosions and what else they couldn't effectively create. --The character designers for some reason couldn't design anything to look younger than 40. for the first 10 years of this game's existence. 90% of the male hero characters are freaking bald or balding. Dota artists never went to art school it seems and whoever is the creative director has never had any art or design sense"

21440,"This game will ruin any ambitions you have in real life. This game will consume all your energy, money and happiness. You might start as a casual player, enjoying the fun parts of the game. But the more you play, the more you descend into this pit of pure mental torture. This game will make even the most calm person into a raging toxic human being in some point of playing. The sheer toxicity this game causes even suppasses neurosis of the traditional road rage.
You're better off hot railing meth than playing this godforsaken game.
For every moment of fun and accomplishment you get 5 moments of desperation in this addicting hell hole.

Now when it comes to skins. The marketing and hype for skins is absolutely incredible. Valve did a good job creating a platform, where having expensive items that do jack'all is considered that of a higher social status, somehow similar to buying expensive branded clothes. Of course a lot of people don't care about skins. But let me tell you. Once you start getting into the game more. You start seeing yourself improving as you go on. And you will absolutely spend money on skins rather than buying a new game or something different on steam. It's an ego trap. Everyone thinks they are on a road to becoming the best player, which gives them a justification for spending money on useless ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•, and for the more mentaly unstable individuals... Gamble with those items, so that they get stuck in this loop of wanting to return to their base value by gambling more. Creating gambling addicts disguised as videogame players- What is even more damaging, is the fact that valve doesn't enforce the ratings of their games, even to the extent of microtransactions. Making teenagers without developed rational thinking fall down the rabbit hole on the same basis as non-consentable sexual conduct would have."

21669,only techies
21670,"Dota 2 is often compared to League of Legends but let me tell you : They are both completly different games. Where League of Legends is easy to play, hard to master, Dota 2 is on its side,  is hard to play, hard to master. It is far from impossible and, I'm not going to lie, I really enjoyed spending time learning the tremendous amount of mechanics that this game has to offer and I still has so much to discover!

The game is insanely beautiful and believe me, if you put your heart in it, you'll feel the same amazing feeling of wonder and discovery that I felt playing both League of Legends and Dota 2. To be honnest,, watching Dota 2 videos feels like someone explaining you the rules of a strategic board game and once I manage to apply these strategies, the game suddenly feels way more attractive and exciting.

I've only played 10 hours and I'm willing to spend more. For those of you who fear that they won't be able to learn by themselve, there is an amazing and supportive community and an excellent tutorial that guides you perfectly and allows you to play a game with someone giving advice in real time.

I would overall highly recomment this game but warn you on one thing. DO NOT INSTALL DOTA JUST TO TRY IT AND QUIT AFTER BEING LOST IN A GAME. Just watch a beginner's guide on youtube first, and install the game if you are looking for a good non toxic MOBA, and over everything, if you want to discover the amazing content this game has to offer.
In other words, if you expect the game to fully guide you on your first game, you'll quit. Just try to know about the game a little bit more before jumping in.

God forbid you tell someone they are doing something wrong. I even tried investing money into the game to show the community i am a serious gamer with the best intentions. ""Let's try and work TOGETHER"". They won't let you have it. I spent over 200 dollars for a high battle pass. No, they wont listen. I am 100% sure if a professional dota2 player were to go undercover at this rating and play support role or offlane they will literally pull their hairs out.  There is no serious punishment in this game. Why are these people allowed to play rank when the whole ranking system is broken. Why is it so hard to ban people from rank. WHY"

21793,The game I love to hate and hate to love. Dota has been in my life for 12 years now and I have played it more than 5000 hours. Dota has challenged my professional and educational life many time by simply taking up to much attention that needed to be placed elsewhere. It has challenged relationships with friends and family. Overall it is one hell of a drug that will give you the highest highs and lowest lows. Play it with friends and be careful. Once Dota 2 has you in its claws it will consume and feed on your life until you realize there is only Dota 2 and it is all you got together with those sick ingame skins. Sure give it a try. You have been warned.

DEAD GAME
FULL BUG GAME"
21991,"In all honesty, I love this game. I started in 2012, and being that I was playing with a group of friends; I fell in love with it. In the beginning, this game was amazing. I've invested(wasted) more than 15,000(est 20) hours of my life, and even played at a pro-am level for a time; only to be brought down by its community. Each time I have returned to calibrate, someone is there to ruin it a good 70% of the time. There is almost zero chance that you're going to get a consistent 3 games in where someone isn't breaking their items and/or walking down mid. Though there was a flag/report system implemented, it seems to have not truly made a difference. It's very hard to start / stay in to something when you can't actually enjoy it,"
21992,I keep getting penalized for sucking ass at the game. 10/10 best game of all time!
21993,"If you're looking for a review on this game you've come to the wrong place, but if you're looking for an outstanding pie recipe you've come to the right place.

Ingredients:

1. 6 tablespoons unsalted butter
2. 1/2 cup white sugar
3. 1/2 cup brown sugar
4. 1/4 cup water
5. 1/4 teaspoon cinnamon
6. 1 pinch salt
7. 5 apples - peeled, cored and sliced
8. 1 pastry for double-crust pie

Directions:

1. Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C).
2. Combine butter, white sugar, brown sugar, water, cinnamon, and salt in a saucepan over medium heat. Bring to a boil, remove from heat and set aside.
3. Roll out half the pastry to fit a 9-inch pie plate. Place bottom crust in pie plate; pour in apple slices.
4. Roll out top crust into a 10-inch circle. Cut into 8 (1-inch) wide strips with a sharp paring knife or pastry wheel. Weave the pastry strips, one at a time, into a lattice pattern. Fold the ends of the lattice strips under the edge of the bottom crust and crimp to seal.
5. Pour butter-sugar mixture over top of pie, coating the lattice, and allowing any remaining sauce to drizzle through the crust.
6. Bake in the preheated oven for 15 minutes. Reduce heat to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C), and bake until the crust is golden brown, the caramel on the top crust is set, and the apple filling is bubbling, 35 to 40 more minutes. Allow to cool completely before slicing."

22006,"They keep changing the game dynamics, it's super annoying, especially when you dial in a character.  And they nerf certain characters out of the blue, the calibration is all over the place, but one inconsistency is new character are overly strong.  So if you want a advantage play the new characters.  Some game mechanics get completely changed so don't expect to play the game for a bit, and then return and think everything is the same.  You'll get creamed with that thought, and like I said every update shifts the balance."

22184,"Don't waste your time as I did with this game. It will take you nowhere.

The matchmaking is not designed to give you fair match ups, but to make you play more. It does not matter how good you perform, you will eventually get paired for consecutive times with a team that is way below your skill and knowledge and you will go down in mmr again. The MM works as intended so you it keeps you addicted to the game, with the false promise that if you practice you will improve and will get better quality games. That is not going to happen. 

Another thing is the inability of people to cooperate and be nice to others. I now understand why in the job offer descriptions it is commonly asked to have good team player skills. Average people don't have those skills and cannot cooperate."

22414,"No not recommend, game never gives an option for recalibration, filled with griefers early and the most toxic community in the world. Game is little to not in any way moderator or reviewed, griefers allowed to grief tens to hundreds of games before banning. Oh did i tell you Dota doesn't care if you have account since 2012 it will matchmake for countless games with people that started yesterday ( you can be legend and paired with herald, you can be legend and have account bought and most of the time when you play carry your support will farm grief you, and when you play support, your carry is a feeder ).

22417,"Instead of playing this incoherent cesspool of a game, try channeling your energies into other, more productive activities. Study harder, turn your C's to A's, and get into a great college. Spend more time with your significant other, and strengthen your relationships. Pick up other hobbies, and refine your skillset for your future careers. But sadly, as of now, your parents are fighting downstairs, your dad giving your mother another black eye, she screams for your help, but you do not listen, because your headphones are noise cancelling. You are single, the girl you infatuate over is not thinking about you. You're sweaty, not too fat, but not fit either, worthless, mediocre grades, acne all over you worthless face, and you're trying to escape the clutches of the inevitable reality of your situation. The toxic community will only enable all your vices, giving you the desire to either kill yourself, or kill others. Dota 2 is a spawn of sin, where the inner sinful human emerges. Racism, sexism, classism, and other harmful remarks fill the chat boxes, instead of team synergy. Over-inflated, egotistical bone heads fill the server regions, yelling their primitive and uneducated insults.

I started this game with high hopes. I was inspired by my older cousins hyping up for Dendi's, ""Fountain Hook"". I introduced this game to my friends as well. A few months later, it became an addiction. I quit after a few years, and it felt beautiful. I was a new man. Then my friends got into it again, and I decided to join again. Flashbacks and pain is all I got. Don't get me wrong, I wasn't bad at the game, but I wasn't a pro either. All memories, whether a clean rampage or a rank up, it all felt like painful ones.

Dota 2 is really one of those games that separates boys from men. You are not a man if you play this game."

22553,"This review is for new players who are considering installing this game.
From a player who has played this game for 5820 hrs, Dota2 is the number one free-to-play online game for me until now and I hope it always be.

Starting with the pros, anybody could be good at this game without spending any money as there is no cost for buying heroes, only some of them, which require more complex skills, will be unlocked when you reach the number of games played required(last checked 25 games of any heroes). Speaking of free to play, you might have questions about Dotaplus. Does having it make you play better than other players? Overall, it is like a shortcut for new players because it provides guides for picking heroes and building items. However, players could alternatively learn these things by experience or other free platforms. There are a lot of youtube channels or websites that provide FREE educational knowledge for this game. Hence, I disagree as the only Dotaplus function which is really useful for me is the option to avoid players. 

Moreover, all heroes are well-designed to be played in various ways,  making this game flexible. One hero could be played in 2-3 different roles depending on the trend of the current patch. In terms of item building, there is no fixed pattern for buying items. You will learn to analyze the game and build items according to the situation and your strategy. By experimenting with them, anyone could be the innovator of the meta(most effective tactics available). 

Ultimately, for those who like beautiful cosmetics. There are tons of cool skins and limited cosmetic items you can get from seasonal events. And the fact that heroes' cosmetics could be customized part by part, you can make your own set of costumes. Besides the hero's skin, there are many magnificent creep(minion or whatever you want to call it) skins, terrain, towers,  weather effects, HUD, and even announcer packs you can customize. And some of them are at a low price. And again, having these things doesn't affect your skill play. 

However, there are some cons as well, namely, the toxic parts of the community. You may meet some players who have toxic attitudes which could affect your play. It would be great if you have good immunity and a positive mental attitude against these players. 

Furthermore, Dota2 seems to be super complicated for beginners especially those who never experienced MOBA(massive online battle arena) games before. It takes time to go through the basics. So it is recommended to finish all the tutorials before entering normal matches. It might sound boring, but trust me, the more you learn, the more fun this game will become.

This game gives me a lot of things. As the servers open internationally, my English and typing skill are improved. I met a Thai friend who is in Norway last year and we have been playing together until now. This game also brought me a good community on Facebook which I can feel free to ask anything even it's not about Dota2. To conclude, I have no regret playing this game."
22554,Super fun but hard to get into.
22555,I fucking hate and love this game very much

22638,"Game itself is great but for a complete novice to Dota the overwatch system just doesn't work. I never cheat and never deliberately disrupt play but have frequently been reported for these. Main problem is once inexperience has been punished by restricting your game options there is only the Single Draft available to play. This provides a choice of 3 random heroes to play, from well over 100, which pretty much ensures that you are again playing a hero for the first time, performing like the novice you are with that hero and slipping behind in the play. Once you are a level of two behind you are likely to be constantly targeted for easy kills, build up a hill death rate and then be accused of feeding again. Surely it would be better if a player is thought to be playing badly they should be restricted to the beginners option. The single draft is the worst possible solution."
22639,It's actually just too good.  I was (am) hooked.  Probably couldn't stop if I had to.  Don't start playing this game.

22655,"While my hours here in Dota 2 show a low number, I played at least 6900+ hours of DotA.  This is a one of the most fun multiplayer games ever made. It is also a game with the worst community ever. I recommend it for the gameplay, but I also wouldn't recommend it because of the community.

Also, Dota plus should be part of the game, not behind the paywall."
22656,good game
22657,"Honestly, after over a thousand hours, you'd think this game would be considered fun.

But the community is as toxic as it gets. Just horrible horrible people that the first thing they say in a match is a complaint. The matches where you find cool enjoyable people that even if you lose, make the match fun and nice to have played, are rare and far in between.

Here is the thing, you need some sort of communication to play this game efficiently. But there's no point in communicating if all it is going to do is make you fucking mad and want to kill someone. I've played this thing on and off over the years and when I think I should give it a try, 'cause maybe, just maybe the community evolved and started behaving better. No. That doesn't happen. It's a game full of people complaining, yelling and calling people names on the microphone. Idiots saying EZ after a 1 hour long match. People whining ""Where is the team?!"" when they are moving on their own solo in the enemy jungle. 

I can't stress this enough. If you want to get into this game, just don't. Forget all about it. Go watch the e-sports scene or something. 

Just don't play this game that only breeds toxicity. The community here is fundamentally broken by a game design that supports toxic behavior.

As inferior as League of Legends is, at least their Honor system made an improvement towards rewarding players that behave well and aren't toxic. Meanwhile in dota, we get a report system that does almost nothing. Because you get minor punishments for being toxic and zero rewards for being a good fun person."

So I started grinding on this game 24/7. It became natural for me. I couldn't put this game down. I sold my brother on eBay just for money to buy skins. Eventually I played so much till my fingers fell off. Then my hands fell off. My arms and legs came off next. Next thing I knew, I was just a human chicken nugget. I still play this game every single day for a minimum of 25 hours a day and play with my tongue on my keyboard and my belly button on the mouse. I was basically twerking every time I moved my mouse. I am thankful for these amazing memories, but sadly, sacrifices need to be made in order to get your rewards."

22738,"there is nothing enjoyable about this game every person has been playing for hundreds of hours longer leading to your inevitable failure.  you level up exponentially slower than everyone else, leading to you being a level 14 when everyone else is a 22 or 30 and you get absolutely crushed.  the only way to rectify this problem is to spend several hundred dollars on items for your hero's.  other players can also have you banned from the game for several hours because they did not like the fact that you don't understand the game yet.  of which once you are banned you can not play a match for several hours or days.  after which you now are in a setting that only allows you to play people that are far stronger than you, and this leads to a complete and utter disappointment of which you will never leave.  in summery the point of a game is to bring joy and fun this game dose neither of these things, in fact i found myself being nothing but upset and angry then depressed for the continuous losses.  in this game you will maybe win one out of 50 matches and i surely wont be due to anything that  you contributed.  dont download this game and certainly dont spend your money on anything in this game."

I received a 17 year ban from Dota 2 since 1 year for ""boosting, account sharing, or other matchmaking abuse."" I can assure you that I have not been cheating, abusing, or manipulating matchmaking in any way shape or form.I just have 52% of winrate.

I can provide any other evidence required.i play since 2014 this game ,since i get banned in 2021 i stop playing and i don¬¥t know what do now.Another prove is i recover mi acount today because was stoled.

I trust that this issue will be resolved soon. I have been a loyal customer since Dota was in beta and continue to spend large sums of my disposable income supporting the game. I understand that players can sometimes become frustrated and report based on that frustration, but my MMR has not increased significantly and I would trust any sort of matchmaking abuse system would take that into account.i realy love this game and i want to play again, please help me.

22933,"Dota ist wie ein Unfall, blo√ü mit dem Unterschied das man nicht nur Hinguckt sondern gleich mitmacht und gar nicht mehr aufh√∂rt. Wer einmal richtig mit diesem Spiel begonnen hat h√∂rt nie wieder auf, auch wenn es mal Pausen geben kann, los wird man dieses Spiel nicht. Die Toxische Community ist dabei wie die Kirsche auf der Torte.

Ich muss dieses Spiel dennoch empfehlen, da ich sonst zugeben m√ºsste dass (Stand Jetzt) ich 1800h meines Lebens verschwendet h√§tte, also: Dota 2 macht Spa√ü!"

23135,"There is no such thing as a good player, only good characters. Nobody will ever be able to prove me otherwise because it's an intentional design choice to give gaming's biggest rejects something to play.

Do you really think Riki pickers can beat Cuphead? Do you really think Bloodseaker pickers can beat Dark Souls? Do you really think Wraithking pickers can control the spray of an AK in CSGO? No, I didn't think so. These people can't do shit. That's exactly why they're stuck playing MOBAS. They know the moment they play a real game of skill they'll be outed as a fake gamer, no different from a mom playing candy crush on her Ipad.

The heros that take skill to play are there to bring in all the people that just can't believe the reality of the truth. Pick the easier hero and win. That's it. That's every single game you'll ever play of this all the way to the top level. Don't believe me? Go on dotabuff and look up who has the top win-rates. Go on. Oh is it the easiest heros in the entire game that have the highest win-rate? How could that be if the game is truly based on skill?

The moment you pick your hero the game is already over. If the entire team doesn't counter-pick AND play perfectly, well gg there goes the next 45 minutes. You can lie to yourself and pretend its about last hits in lane and ward control and stacking / pulling and teamwork but you know deep down it's bullshit. If the moron using the brain-dead hero isn't literally afk none of that matters. They simply farm faster, push harder and kill easier. Why play anything else? It's easy and its free so why wouldn't you disgrace your family and country by taking the easy way out every time you're presented the opportunity? If you're at a distinct disadvantage before the game even begins you know you have a terrible competitive experience. If the pick / ban stage is more important than the game itself, no wonder auto battlers are becoming so popular. It's a natural evolution of ""I'm terrible at everything so I'll only play games that cater to my defect.""

It's like playing chess but one of the players can simply choose to start with more pieces. If you don't retaliate by using more pieces yourself then you lose.

I've wasted so much time on MOBAS and now my eyes are open. It's pointless. All of it. Those games will NEVER be about who's the better player. That doesn't matter and never has! It's about picking what's overpowered and easy. People that are total failures in life with no skill need something to play too and I realize that now. If they didn't have something just for them they would be on the street gagging on cock for heroin money so they can have ""one last hit""."

23143,"I recommend this game for people who can enjoy it despite the generally terrible and horrifyingly toxic community. If you can ignore the griefing and the racial slurs or death threats in the all chat, this game is very fun to play. I wouldn't recommend this game for parents to buy for their children solely due to the environment they'd be subjected to. I personally wouldn't want my children/teen to read or hear (yes, there is open voice chat, for some reason) most of what the people say in game. Luckily I am not someone who is affected by it, but I had someone tell me to commit s*icide in-game today, totally unprovoked by anyone. No one was bothering him, as a matter of fact we were winning, and this behavior still continues. It doesn't happen in every match, but the bad definitely outweighs the good. There is some nice players in Dota 2, but the most of it, is NOT beginner friendly/supportive. Many people are mean and not understanding at all that you are new and/or may need some help. Even if you are new and do not need help, you will still receive bad treatment. If you are a veteran Dota player, you will still experience this. Like I said, it does indeed have it's wonderful fan-base, if you can find them. This game is not meant for people who cannot enjoy the game when these issues are taking place constantly. Also, PARENTS, please take time to read into reviews on online games and don't subject your child to the horrors that can be the gaming community. If you are a parent reading this, thinking about getting the game because your kid asked you for it, don't buy it for them until you think they're mature enough to handle the awful nature of humans. With all that being said I love the game, I just wish the people that played it were at peace with themselves."
23144,"Imagine spending hours learning a complex game that revolves around team play. Learn to enjoy it. Start playing ranked matchmaking and Smurfs ruin the whole game. Waste 30-60 min knowing you can't win because someone on the other team is abusing matchmaking just to get easy wins. Know let me tell you that its completely obvious when Smurfing occurs and valve simply doesn't do anything to fix it. This game is cancer and i wish i never started playing it and invested money into buying battlepasses. Until Smurfing is solved, stay way. You'll thank yourself"

23205,"Been playing on and off for years,was just introduced to a rule that getting excessive reports locks you out of matchmaking for a MINIMUM OF 4 HOURS. I dont disagree with this rule except for the simple fact I was issued this ban after a team of people decided to complain about the game,then proceed to afk at the very beginning of the match,yet somehow their reports were justifiable enough to the system to get me locked out for ""feeding"" when I was the only one actually attempting to play the match,of course im going to feed when im 1v5 against a fed enemy team. Fun game when people play without crying and afk'ing, but thats one in a million matches."

23250,"it's such a tragedy wasting your youth defending an ancient over and over again.
for everyone out there reading this comment, you can save hundreds even thousands hours of your time, you can save your youth , go find new things in life , enjoy the fresh air , PLAY ANOTHER GAME , find new friends or even get a girl friend; because after like 200-300 hours of this game you become addicted and it gives you the actual dopamine you need to waste your day. nothing gives you pleasure but achieving 30 mmr which can be easily taken down by one person in your team. 
this game can get you thrilled like if you are fighting for your own life in a real battle.but there is no light without darkness,
it can also make you angry as if you wanna seek revenge for someone, and the latter happens even more than former.
with all being said , in my opinion , if becoming an E-sport player is not your main goal of playing this game , you're gonna achieve anything but regret and depression. 
as a 4k trash player and having like +10k hours playing this game, i have finally decided to abandon this game forever.
i had such a great time playing with my friends over this 10 years, even with some people i have more hours playing than meeting them in real life :), i will never forget the amazing team fights and strategies we made at the games we had.
Dota 2 and its community will always remain in my heart and i had my best life moments at this game. 
(my tears are falling while i'm writing these words ) 
recently i reached the age of 24 and i realized that i'm a loser and its time to give up on this dream and say goodbye to dota 2. but i never wanted to leave here without any words being said.
thanks for reading this comment , i wish all of you guys reach top LeaderBoards and become e-sport tier 1 players.

23268,"For me Dota2 was the first video game that really felt like a team game in the same way sports do. It also provides a path for player growth as opposed to character growth. In many games your sense of progression comes from completing levels, beating the game, advancing your character level/gear/abilities, acquiring loot or getting a high score. There's no in-game persistence in Dota2"
23269,"TOXIC GAME . POOR MMR SYSTEM .

23347,"This game is made by terrible people, pulling all stops to suck your dry of all your worth. Most people you meet in game are themselves terrible, and it's no wonder. The game is designed to turn you into a stressball for the entire time you're in the game. If you're new, you will be crucified each and every match by your compatriots. Matchmaking will actively put you with people who have been sucking simply because you haven't. So If you're doing well, it is by design to get teamed with tilted, stressed, and aggressive players that ruin the match for you, and leave you yourself grumpy. Seek a therapist before playing this game. You need all the mental strength you can get before enjoying this game."

The game is frequently updated, sometimes for better sometimes for worse but the developers will keep working on it since its one hell of a cash cow for a game that is 100% free [excluding event passes and cosmetics and DOTA+ but they're all optional you pleb]. 

I fear the day they introduce something that allows you to see how much you have spent on this time sink, because i know mine will just contain an image of Gabens face with GG EZ signed on the bottom in gold..

I have played over 3000 hours and some games leave me wondering if I even know how to play it. 
  

Would I recommend it? 
The game is free to play unless you want to play Dress up, All you have to lose is your time [so much god damn time]. 

If you don't like toxic players, then play Turbo, and ridicule toxic players for not playing ranked.

23504,"Had it not been for how shit is the matchmaking system, I would have rated this game positively.
I strictly play ranked matchmaking and the only thing I can call this pile of shit matchmaking system is, plain and simply, RIGGED, and blatantly at that.

For the past 3 days, every match I hop into I get 1 or more Gaben Agents(it's what I call these retarded teammates I get), drow offlane, or offlaner that plays like a an hard carry or doesn't make space or I have to sacrifice myself to initiate a fight, or a support that ults creep waves,  while I am near them and pinging, saying in chat that I am coming to farm it, or trolls(although very rarely, it's mostly people that really have no idea how to play their selected role and constantly making bad decisions, which in turn loses the game), or when I don't play carry and go offlane, the safelaner plays offlane, getting into stupid fights, or just rubs one out(because he's no farming) the entire game while I am giving my all making space, getting into fights, pushing lanes, etc.

What I am trying to say is that, when I play any role, I always try to do my job the best I can and in turn I get these pieces of shit in my team that don't know in what world they are living, or what game they are playing.
I have no fucking idea how I get these monkeys only in my team, never in the enemy team, they actually play their selected roles, their supports teleport for help on other lanes, and so on and it really makes me wonder, AM I A FUCKING SCHIZO, what am I doing wrong, I even watched some pro players tips and guides on this game and based on what they show in their videos I am doing the right thing, so why am I not able to WIN A SINGLE FUCKING MATCH?

I lost 500 mmr in these 3 days, no matter what role I pick, no matter what hero I pick, no matter what actions I take, 4/5 games, there is only one outcome."

This review is for new players who are considering installing this game.
From a player who has played this game for 5820 hrs, Dota2 is the number one free-to-play online game for me until now and I hope it always be.

Starting with the pros, anybody could be good at this game without spending any money as there is no cost for buying heroes, only some of them, which require more complex skills, will be unlocked when you reach the number of games played required(last checked 25 games of any heroes). Speaking of free to play, you might have questions about Dotaplus. Does having it make you play better than other players? Overall, it is like a shortcut for new players because it provides guides for picking heroes and building items. However, players could alternatively learn these things by experience or other free platforms. There are a lot of youtube channels or websites that provide FREE educational knowledge for this game. Hence, I disagree as the only Dotaplus function which is really useful for me is the option to avoid players.

Moreover, all heroes are well-designed to be played in various ways, making this game flexible. One hero could be played in 2-3 different roles depending on the trend of the current patch. In terms of item building, there is no fixed pattern for buying items. You will learn to analyze the game and build items according to the situation and your strategy. By experimenting with them, anyone could be the innovator of the meta(most effective tactics available).

Ultimately, for those who like beautiful cosmetics. There are tons of cool skins and limited cosmetic items you can get from seasonal events. And the fact that heroes' cosmetics could be customized part by part, you can make your own set of costumes. Besides the hero's skin, there are many magnificent creep(minion or whatever you want to call it) skins, terrain, towers, weather effects, HUD, and even announcer packs you can customize. And some of them are at a low price. And again, having these things doesn't affect your skill play.

However, there are some cons as well, namely, the toxic parts of the community. You may meet some players who have toxic attitudes which could affect your play. It would be great if you have good immunity and a positive mental attitude against these players.

Furthermore, Dota2 seems to be super complicated for beginners especially those who never experienced MOBA(massive online battle arena) games before. It takes time to go through the basics. So it is recommended to finish all the tutorials before entering normal matches. It might sound boring, but trust me, the more you learn, the more fun this game will become.

This game gives me a lot of things. As the servers open internationally, my English and typing skill are improved. I met a Thai friend who is in Norway last year and we have been playing together until now. This game also brought me a good community on Facebook which I can feel free to ask anything even it's not about Dota2. To conclude, I have no regret playing this game.

23590,"I've wasted 3k hours into this game, I got told to play this by a friend who now has 7k hours. Gaben. Please. Let us go free."
23591,"There's no option to forfeit games that are lost. Like even rocket league has that and it's matches are 5 minutes long. This are a 30-45 minutes. It's ridiculous to not be able to vote for a forfeit. Anyone that says otherwise doesn't know what the hell they are talking about. ""oh but sometimes come back and win! and we wouldn't do that if we forfeited"" - yeah having an option to forfeit doesn't mean your monkey brain doesn't work anymore. You can still actually use your brain cells. You can choose not to forfeit. But it should be an option. It's quality of life. And it's dumb not to have it.
It's a horribly designed game. I mean it's designed to be addictive and create dopamine hits, but it's not fun. It's not well-balanced. It's just awful. Even at the pro level most games are decided in the first 10-15 minutes and then you're just playing it out. Any other competitive game you can be down and make a comeback, but this game makes it harder for you to make a comeback for whatever reason. And most games you can tell who is going to win in the first five minutes. And games last 30-45 minutes. It's just dumb. But they are making money off of us by implementing addictive game mechanics. Nobody has fun playing this game. But people can't stop. And the community is the worst community I've ever seen. A bunch of depressed children throwing tantrums. This game is worse than aids."

23634,"Over time, DOTA 2 has proven itself better than LOL.  Valve has worked hard on getting the experience as low drag and friction free as possible and the integration of the Steam marketplace is very tight even though it's in an external browser.
Hero customization is a big component of this game's appeal for me.  The number and type of customizations will keep me busy for a while. 
I played this game years ago and left because I liked LOL more.  Today the situation has reversed itself.  As a complete novice I like the DOTA 2 heroes and customization.  The gameplay and default controls are spot on. Also, starting this game from a publisher client that I keep running all day long is a huge plus.
Try DOTA 2 again if you left like me.  You'll come back."

23647,Best game
23648,"Tough learning curve but great gameplay, on top of the visuals and sound design (including amazing voice acting). I always come back to Dota 2 periodically, no other game makes me love spending hours reading patch notes this much.

The playerbase however has as many friendly players as it has toxic ones, I recommend keeping a cool head and being nice even when you or your team are doing poorly. If some players are really making you mad, muting them is usually the best course of action. Furthermore, I recommend you to not start a new game right after finishing one, give yourself time to cool down as games of Dota can be very taxing emotionally, in both a good and bad sense.

My main gripe with the game is some aspects of its monetization, as years after years the Battle Passes feel like they require more and more money. I remember when the first arcanas could be bought cash for like $30. Now if you want that snazzy cosmetic for your favourite hero you need an overlevelled Battle Pass worth enough money to instead buy a few AAA games on Steam (or you know, things other than video games, it really is that much money).

But beyond the cosmetics, the gameplay itself is free, and even without a Dota+ subscription (that offers some quality of life that should be in the base game in my opinion), it really is enjoyable.

Also the lore is quite interesting."

23655,"DOTA could be a great game, but Valve keeps this from happening on purpose. Valve milks DOTA for every dollar it can and all of the ways Valve designs DOTA to make as much money as possible basically also ruins DOTA and keeps it from being a great game. Dota Plus is an example and ruins matchmaking. What is the solution? Valve needs to have a pay only version that allows players to control matchmaking, such as 18+ only, or English only. Players also should have to pass a skill test to demonstrate understanding before being able to play at certain levels."

23676,It's a fun experience to have with friends and even family. Definitely doesn't ruin your brain capacity and give you crippling depression. I enjoy it every time. Oh yea and then there's this piece of shit game.
23677,"Valve, by your actions, namely by restricting your users from one of the largest regions of the earth the ability to fully pay for anything in your store, you deprive yourself of monetization, as well as people's trust. In all the conflicts you have shown yourself worthy, but now you have become like those who have always been a bad example for you. I don't understand what you want to achieve with this. If you want to stop the bloodshed in Ukraine, then you clearly do not need to take away one of the few good things that we have left, because no one supports the Russian government, including the Russians, but by this action you only strengthen the pro-Propaganda tales about the ""evil West"" and that there are only enemies around Russia.

Due to that, I started playing Turbo which speeds up the matches considerably and makes them more enjoyable, but unfortunately the match making in Turbo is pretty awful and perhaps non-existent."

Sometimes it can be challenging with characters and other players, best played with friends that are helpful rather than random players that get angry if you are new.

Play it with your friends. Murder and get murdered.
Most of all, have fun. Embrace the challenge. Learn from your deaths. Play with bots. 
Play in pubs. If you encounter toxic people, they're probably having a bad time outside of the game too.
Eventually, you'll find a whole lot of wholesome people to play with. :D"

24009,Good Game
24010,"It's a bit hard to rate this game, because the core gamemode, the performance, the entire client, test mode, the console, et cetera are superb. If I was rating patch 7.00 or around that era, I would definitely recommend, but the game is a lot more stale now to me. It's not *because* of the introduction of neutral items, but around that patch changes have gradually just been annoying or unimpactful. 

The game's biggest downside has been the matchmaking as long as I have been around, but you can't exactly leave a negative review on humanity. I come back every patch for a little to see if it sparks my interest again and it hasn't since 2019. I think it has gone further in the direction of other mainstream MOBAs and generally the changes have been unpleasant as I alluded to earlier. 

If you're getting into the game now, you probably missed the fun days. It's just an unhealthy pastime now that can sometimes give a modicum of satisfaction for all the stress it heaps onto you during a session. If you've been around a while you probably have 5k hours and understand the nuances of these changes better than I do."

I used to be mad at Valve for ""stealing"" the WarCraft III mod and making it their own. However, after all this years of having fun on Dota 2 not only am I not mad, but I'm glad they did. Blizzard would've never had the guts to make it their own IP.

24046,"This game is essentially impossible to get into right now.
There is no new/returning player queue, except for one that tries to find players within a minute and if it doesn't, you'll just play a botgame, which is not only extremely boring, but also can't teach you how to play a game with real players.
Everyone hates you for not knowing the metagame and they'll let you know they're frustrated they had to play with you.
Guides are assuming your supports aren't actively trying to steal your farm after you've missed a single creep kill. Guides are assuming you're not the only one ever warding, while being the main carry.
And the enemy midlaner is going to be a russian smurf with 5000 hours on Invoker or Phantom Assassin every second game.

Well, the only way to get into the game is watch a hundred hours worth of the latest tournament to know the pick/ban metagame and play for maybe 500h in close proximity.

Also the community is worse than any other game's that I've ever seen. Better to turn voice chat down or off, so you don't get your ears hurt by screaming teammates."

24182,"Dota is a very team orientated game. If you dont play well with others, maybe give it a miss. 3 lanes, towers in each and an ancient. Death of the ancient (D-o-t-a). Destroy the ancient win the game. Fairly simple.

What make this game additive; If you curious about learning, team work, tactics and wit, all this plus an always updating meta leaving you with a very balanced game. Theres no pay to win, every game starts at the same, with 110 hero +. A 5V5 MATCH ,Leaving you with a new experience every single game.

Beside a balanced meta, there a very fluid comeback mechanic and regardless if yout losing, if you pull together as a team. get a little sneak you can turn the tables at any point (or throw it all away). And thats why its an incredible game. 

In terms of learning, there are a few techniques technically to understand. Learning about items across the different tiers in the game, early, mid, late. and how these items synergize with your own hero, your team and your enemies. I used to pick a hero, read there abilities and just have sooo much fun. I think its a game that requires a lot of acceptance, change flexibility. Every game is different and you need to think differently. 
The best players understand that. Some dont and you will lose.

Its always good to have some friends, as they will teach you alot, and just have a blast ! Give ti a shot its rather simple. take it a game/ hero at a time."

24269,"7.31 update it is obvious that the designer's goal tends to simplify hero skills to adapt to new players. Taking the techies as an example, it was originally a hero with relatively high learning cost. Self explosion death means weighing the pros and cons. The techies's use of remote-control bomb to kill people is required to control the whole map, map resource points, player psychology and important time nodes, Heroes have a deep understanding of their own damage calculation and a series of other skills. Now it's simple and rough to directly remove this skill. It's just to experience with new players, which makes old players sick. Although I am often defeated by the techies who the enemy can play, I don't feel that the game experience is poor, because this is the game experience that the techies on the opposite side deserves through learning. Our team doesn't have a good coping strategy because of experience. If we want a good game experience, the way is for the team to learn the strategy to deal with the techies, or an old player to tell his teammates how to deal with it through communication, Conversely, I can master the hero of the techies through learning, so I don't need the designer to delete this skill in order to save the player experience defeated by the powerful techies!!!!!!! If it is not for this reason to delete skills, but to let players experience the fun brought by new skills to players, please separate the skills of the techies in version 7.31 and become a new hero!!!!!!!!

By the way, the design of new hero monster is a shit, marci too.

r u sure about that the first skill of techies did not copy from one of lol heros called maokai's? this is disgusting.

One of the reasons for the large number of lol players is that the overall game mechanism is simple.Dota compared to LOL, the hero proficient curve span is longer. Once proficient in a hero, the player proficient in heroes will be difficult to overcome. This is the charm of DOTA. It's disgusting if the designer wants to simplify this point to attract players. Many years later, all dota heroes became lol heroes,Why not play lol now?Because dota designers have admitted that lol is more attractive.

24295,"Freezes on linux with an AMD Ryzen 9 3900 & NVIDIA RTX 2060 SUPER!

Game plays fine for half the game then decides to freeze for 2 to 15 seconds at a time, every 1-5 seconds.. pausing the game unfreezes everything until you unpause then it goes back to freezing.. it's so bad you can't even ALT+F4 out of the game sometimes, the only way to escape the freeze-hole is to force power-off the whole computer.

Tried several drivers, different distros, caching or not caching shaders, gamemode enabled or disabled, nothing works...

I used to love this game but this fk around has me so frustrated I've begun to hate the game (or more like the devs who clearly don't care about linux users).

Searching for fixes is such a headache, which is just a bunch of people giving loose theories that don't solve anything.

24300,"If you're looking to get into Dota 2, my recommendation is don't. If it were a couple years ago I'd say something about how it's one of those ""hate to love it"" games where you say it's bad but can't stop playing it and I'd say it's worth giving a try. But nowadays this game is slowly dying. Updates are few and far between, with less content and lazier content. Their promoting this big ""Primal Beast"" update but it only changes about 10% of the roster in any meaningful way and the new hero is just ripped assets from an event minigame. The game gets stale due to lack of meaningful updates and Valve's shown that they care a lot more about how much money they can squeeze out of the player base than the game's longevity. 

TLDR: The game's slowly dying out with fewer and lazier content updates. Most updates are just ways for valve to get more of your money with in game purchases."

24315,"I never thought I would get addicted to a """"click to move"""" type of game, but oh boy, Dota 2 has some insane depth and replayability.
Each match is different! Community may be harsh and idiotic sometimes, but try to not let that stopping you from playing and enjoying it! It really is the best Free to Play game.
It requires you to learn many little things, skills, items, timings etc. You must play for at least 100 hours to get a grip of it, and about 1000h to know a bit of everything. So patience and skill is required!
With all the hours played I still learn new things and new interactions in the gameplay every day. This game is so deep and gives you such a variety of experiences! Still completely free of charge, try it for oyurself but give it several attempts, don't give up on the first lost match!
With continuous support from Valve and heavy gampleay impacting updates, you are always required to re-learn and adapt. Gameplay is always balanced and thoughtful. Absolutely no pay2win involved, all just cosmetics.

24336,"The hardest, most frustrating, most rewarding game on the planet. You and 9 other people, hundreds of abilities/items, infinite possible situations, games can go from 15 minutes to 2 hours.

If your friends play it and are trying to get you into it, you too can have fun, after a tiny commitment of 100+ hours before you stop getting yelled at.

As someone that's played both, League of Legends has the superior new player experience and a more ""mobile game"" feel to it, but doesn't have anywhere near the depth of DotA. Everything in League is constantly balanced to make each role feel fun and rewarding. In DotA, everything is unfair and overpowered, and it's on you to prove that your team is more unfair than theirs. Hour-long games end in a moment because of a single misclick.

If you read all that and still think it sounds fun, go for it."

24499,"As a new player, its completely broken; there is a learn option at the screen top which leads to some tutorials, but they're actually broken right now (despite reboots and retrying.)  First tutorial, game shows the map and then hangs (shows some variable dumps from scripts but nothing happens); second tutorial has a different broken problem. Found the Arcade section has a community made tutorial (I guess the Valve tutorial sucks?) and it crashed and disconnected a few times. (Looks like recent patch, maybe that broke things?)

24711,they took away aghanim's labyrinth. so your now left with the sweaty try hards who have 5000+ hours
24712,"If you want a good and challenging MOBA, this is the one"
24713,it good
24714,"Honestly, HARD to learn, will take you at least 1000 hours to be decent but if you aren't willing to take advice then go play league of legends. You can get good very fast if you listen but the community in Dota struggle to grasp that concept so lobbies are filled with toxic arguments that are irrelevant to Dota itself. Overall the game has strong replay ability and is really fun when you are playing with a group of people who understand the core mechanics. Otherwise once you get good, you are screwed because valve doesn't do anything about smurfing or account buying. 8 years of playing the game, i would play another 8 years... The game teaches you patience and anxiety management LOL. Fix your shit valve"
24715,i like fortnite

Even when i felt horrible for various reasons I would play dota to make the time pass and forget about the problem for a second.

Also it's the deepest game I have ever played."

24733,"I once had hopes, and dreams
At least I think I did
I was a person once
Now all that is gone
And left in its place

Dont make my mistake child
There are worlds and wonders to be found in them
But they are not for us
We are the lost and consumed 
Waiting for death

24763,"I was already ranking up 500 + mmr then suddenly giving me disconnecting team mates or feeders. Games I have saved replays and relayed to other players. Really an insulting game to play not worth playing mmr for. A game I cant take seriously after loving it for so many years. Stop rostering me people who cant physically play.

24848,"Even though you play on the same few maps with similar items, there‚Äôs so much depth and strategy going on that no two matches of League of Legends ever feel the same. It‚Äôs distinctive style encourages surprise attacks and frequent use of skill-shot powers, and its colorful art style makes everything pop on the screen. Learning how to make the most of its characters and to become an asset to a team is a long and challenging process, but once you‚Äôve got it down, it‚Äôs incredibly satisfying to work together to destroy your enemies in this amazing MOBA."

24939,"I was a complete noob, picking Riki and Slark every game.

And then, DOTA Plus came into my life! The computer told me to pick Juggernaut, and to go mid-lane against a Shadow Fiend. I was skeptical, certain that I couldn't possibly out-harass someone with three razes, but then DOTA plus suggested I use Blade Fury!

The three razes wiffed against my spin-to-win, and I was about to run back, but then DOTA Plus gently took control of my mouse, moving it unbidden of my will! He ran forward, not drawing creep aggro while laying down magic damage onto the SF.

Then DOTA Plus alerted me that the enemy Ogre Magi was missing, and got me to safety. After this, DOTA Plus opened all chat, and taunted the SF about having to share XP with the Ogre. They began fighting in a language I didn't understand, but thankfully DOTA Plus comes with machine language learning too, and began flaming them in their native tongue!

Not only that, but DOTA Plus suggested that I could have another cup of water, and informed me that it would handle the last-hits for the next minute and a half. On my time away from the computer, my eyes wandered out of my window, and locked onto a woman my age, with beautiful eyes. The connection was instant, but I had DOTA to play.

However, when I returned to my computer, DOTA Plus told me ""Go to her, go to her, tell her you love her, and NEVER let go! Life is too short!"" Then DOTA Plus got a rampage on my behalf under the enemy Tier 3. Clearly, I wasn't needed here.

I have been married for five years now, and now I am climbing to Divine 5 while brushing up on fulfilling hobbies, like learning the violin and writing my novel manuscript. Thank you DOTA Plus, you have saved my life, and made me a happy and fulfilled human being.

24974,i literally do not recommend this game to other people esp the ones who are very sensitive or depressed because this game will make them even worst. secondly in every bracket you be at.  there's still tons of taxtics no matter what life time behaiviour or medal rank you have. this is not my main account either but planned to rank it up saw some stupid messages in game by my teammates they also play so  bad u did everything u can like ur dmg was higher than all of them so as networth they mentioning u are the reason who ruined their game instead they playing solo all time insulting and avoiding for no reason that's why i never suggest this game.

If you say it is only for low bracket go ahead and see what's going on High bracket as well. Dont waste your time play something else. You have win steak maybe but in the end you will have lose streak as well cause dota algorithm wont let you take win so much it gives smurf players on enemy team and fucking retarded players on your team. Mostly you will stay in the same mmr at the end of the day cause if you lose you will lose -20 mmr if you win you will get 20 mmr doesn't matter if you play good or bad so it is so hard to rank up after legend and ancient fuck dota i am free now."

Good point, it would be an awesome map pool if the 3 new maps were made. Good point, it would be an awesome map pool if the 3 new maps were made.

25069,one of the worst games on steam... don't play this game!! i warn you to stay away from it as much as you can because this... this is not a game this is a torture machine(still in beta bdw) that is meant to punish you! oh you won a game or 2? you feel like you have a good streak? a shame if i put you with 4 monkey's in the same team as you for the next 5 games who eat crayons and don't know how to press buttons on the keyboard that they just go in the enemy team and die for like 10 times in a row and still they dont understand not to fight! no this is not a team game this is a game about endurance and i mean how much can you endure playing this game.

25103,ok
25104,"I really played a looot of Dota 2
It would be such a fun game if they would do something about the community and the reporting system. people can report you for like 0 reason or just cause you dont play like they want you to play. If 3 or so are in one party you can be sure if you lose you get the blames and reports. And now you even can report in game where every impulsive toxic player instantly reports you for like anything. I played a lot Dota and you can be sure if you play certain heroes you are 30% of your game time in low prio cause people just report you for picking it.

Honestly get your community and report system right. I ve played league of legends for years as well and in comparison the community there is a my little pony friendship club. I mean i got literally flamed 40 min long, got wished cancer and the death of my mother cause i bought one single potion too much ... And such people still dont get banned cause noone is looking over that stuff. It just counts how many premades did report ya no matter what happend.

I can NOT recommend it as long as this toxic behavier is not punished and even gets rewarded.
What i can recommend is that all who want play dota go play league of legends ... there you have a normal report system that doesnt count the number of random reports but the chat and kda. so when you get banned its deserved.

I get 15-25 commends each 20 games yet still       2-3 reports drop my behavior score by 700-800 . Each time i want to play i search games for 10-15 mins for all 5 positions just  to get another 9 already muted players in game. Once loved game Become a filthy place  that you won't come back.

25164,"For me MOBA is failing as genre little by little. 
You can play it if you like the game and want to make money (as a professional) but as a regular player I find it very unwelcome place (same as League of Legends and any other MOBA)

The concept of playing 5vs5 requires you to engage 4 friends to play comfortably. If you play solo, the problem will be communication. People are different and in competitive game when you need to form a team extremely fast it fails in 80%. 

The game itself is unfair. I understand why but the fact is the fact. You simply cannot balance 100+ heroes with 4+ spells, additional sub upgrades for skills, items, map, etc. It's simply too much. 

The way the roles are defined also needs work. People always relie on carry and humiliate supports for their uselessness. 
Apart from LOL where every role can carry the game, here you only have a carry type of heroes and the whole game will relies on them which pushes people in solo queue to train only carry type heroes. 

Unfair, unwelcome, overcomplicated but beautifull and creative in terms of creating custom maps the DOTA 2 is very contraversive game. But since it's free, nothing holds you to try it out."

25187,"Welcome to Dota2, The place where you can hone your mental ability and friendship. Especially when you are a solo player.
The community in this game is on the level of transcendent (monkey). Communication in game is very vital, especially from your teammate. The common keyword from your teammate will be something like ""g"" ""b"" ""noob"" ""fuck off"" ""useless"" etc.

If you are a Carry, be careful of your support! Especially the one with the god-like ability ""Hook"" or something that they can hide and bam! use skill on the enemy(ies) from afar. These people will stay in the dark jungle, waiting forever for the ""right"" moment to spam their skill, which often missed. After they left you on your own in the lane and you die because the enemies keep fucking you with all their skill, they will start teleporting to the other lane. When your score hit ""0-3"" or more, the commication between teammate will suddenly improve. the words like ""useless carry"" or ""noob"" is commonly said to you despite the fact that it's him who left you alone to die in the first place. If you are lucky and somehow win the game, your teammate will keep praising you at the end of the game with words like, ""you are lucky"" or something similar. BUT.... if you lose the game. no matter whose fault it is, the words coming from your teammate will be ""noob carry"" or ""useless"". This is where you can hone your mental ability to the max! Brace yourself.

There are great things about this game, the well design roles of heroes and the system that forced you to coordinate with your teammate in order to devise a strategy to crush your enemies. Everything is perfect, except the part that the human is the one who control those awesome heroes.

TLDR; don't ever let your child touch this game. let them stay away from the transcendent monkey community."

25258,"I really enjoy Dota 2. Moba's are probably my favorite genre of games and coming from Smite and League of legends, Dota is definitely my favorite. 

The mechanics of how you move and how spells work are mainly unique and that is what draws me to this game. Every character is a new learning process and keeps you engaged with countless possibilities of what you can do with that character.

The skill gap is insane. Which isn't a horrible thing. It gives sort of a longevity vision that one day you could be on that level. Knowing what's happening every moment and how to correctly respond. That reason alone makes me come back no matter getting absolutely stomped or getting carried. There's always something to learn or something new to try.

My only complaint. The community. Okay, I understand that if you are playing a game that you have thousands of hours in that it can be annoying getting someone new. Someone that doesn't just understand how the game fully works just yet. But that doesn't give you the reason to be flat out horrible to someone. So many people try to gatekeep this game that trying to get my friends to try and enjoy this game is hard. I get trash talk and banter between teams but there is a line and i think there should be more harsh punishment for crossing it. If you are playing UNRANKED expecting a RANKED team comp with everyone playing like they are in the finals of TI. You are part of the problem. Yes you can say ""just mute all and play the game"" but this is a team communication game. Even some of the slightest, smallest bits of information can make all the difference in a match. 

I don't have nearly enough experience or time in this game to represent it but these are my opinions from sinking 500 hours into it. It's a great game and I'm not gonna stop playing no matter who I encounter or however many times I lose. It is just sad to see such a beautiful game with a pretty gnarly community."

25311,"Depression is a mental state of low mood and aversion to activity. Classified medically as a mental and behavioral disorder, the experience of depression affects a person's thoughts, behavior, motivation, feelings, and sense of well-being. The core symptom of depression is said to be anhedonia, which refers to loss of interest or a loss of feeling of pleasure in certain activities that usually bring joy to people. Depressed mood is a symptom of some mood disorders such as major depressive disorder or dysthymia; it is a normal temporary reaction to life events, such as the loss of a loved one; and it is also a symptom of some physical diseases and a side effect of some drugs and medical treatments. It may feature sadness, difficulty in thinking and concentration and a significant increase or decrease in appetite and time spent sleeping. People experiencing depression may have feelings of dejection, hopelessness and suicidal thoughts. It can either be short term or long term."

25319,"My playtime has now exceeded the length of my former marriage. 

Pros and cons

Pros:
1. More communication, even though it's mostly in russian, which I don't understand. Mute function is a plus (can't do that in a marriage unless you wanna get arrested for domestic abuse)

2. More cooperation!

3. You can turn it off and on as you please.

4. Cost less than a marriage/wedding, unless you buy all the skins available.

Cons:

1. I still suck at this game

2. You get blamed for everything that goes wrong, just like in a marriage. 

Enjoy youself cyka!"

25322,mostly fun
25323,"Unless you already have 5000 hours don't bother, the community hates you and valve hates newcomers. Toxicity is not only allowed but encouraged by valve selling toxic and abusable audio lines and refusing to take action on anything anyone says. From what I can tell this games vocabulary consists only of racial slurs and death threats, and it doesn't seem like it's ever going to change. Moba players wonder why their community is so obscure, it's their fault. maybe don't scream the n word at the top of your lungs if a new player isn't playing like a TAS bot. Smurfs are the single most prevalent thing in this entire game. there are guilds full of identical accounts so one asshole can hot swap without fear of ever losing his win streak. maybe the guilds with 75 identical profiles is worth fuckin checkin out huh?

25375,"Best way to describe DOTA is to compare it with a pile of shit. No matter how much you wrap a pile of shit in nice clothing it will still be shit inside.

There is nothing you can learn from this game. There is no fun you can have in this game. It is better to just play some random MMORPG game, that is how low this game is. Scripting, hacking, unfair advantages, various forms of cheating and there is simply nothing to be done, since there is no transparency and you are left in the dark. 

The best thing about this game is to simply delete it."
25376,good
25377,"Love the game play, and how inclusive Dota's introductory phase has become for new players. Definitely still toxicity from some players who don't show patience with others either learning to play heroes or just new to Dota in general.

25425,"If Dendi Was Bad - A Lengthy Shitpost

So imagine you're at a fair with your father. You must be a child cause he's been dead for a decade. You're hungry. He smiles and gives you some cotton candy. You've never tried it before. You're reluctant. He urges you to give it a go. You put it in your mouth. It's heaven clothed in a pink robe. It's a cloud of joy wrapped in the sugar, blood and tears of your screaming pinoy enemies. The taste, the texture, it's so fresh. And you're young and its sweet. You love it. That combination of sticky substance and light fluffiness, it enraptures you. You eat and eat and before you know it its gone. 

Your father laughs and you grin at him, errant pink strands caught between your teeth. You know you shouldn't. Your dentist tells you tooth decay is the leading cause of erectile dysfunction in support players who have decided to ruin your game because they don't approve of your hero pick. You mute your dentist. Cotton candy is lovely. Throughout the day you get more and more. The day is great. It is the last time you'll go to the fair with him. 

Your father is sick. Your mother has started drinking. Dancing takes the pain away but even that has started to lose its shine. You sneak a drink from your mother's bottle of vodka, the one she thinks no one knows about. She hides it under the sink. You can't read the label but the liquid seems to speak to you from inside the glass. –ì–ª—É–ø–∞—è, –ø–æ—á–µ–º—É —É —Ç–µ–±—è –Ω–µ—Ç –ø—ã–ª–∏ –∑–∞ BH. It can't be that bad, she cries less loudly after she drinks. It stings as it goes down, harsh and prickly. You can feel it in the back of your mouth. You choke and sputter. It hurts, but not as much as the fishing trip you and your father just shared. You take another drink. It starts to work. You know it does, you can barely feel the Spectre of your father's diagnosis hanging over you. Haunt is a great skill, personal risk is for scrubs. You keep drinking. 

He's gone now. Your mother tries her best, she's cleaned up. She knows that no matter what she feels she wants to make sure that you'll get through it. You love her for it but the Vodka does things for you she never could. And you have a new escape. It's called Dota. It was free. You bathe the void of your father's loss with temporary triumph. Monster kill, godlike. They tip you in impotent rage. Your team flames them. They flame each other. You stand atop their quivering, lifeless bodies as they wait to respawn. You howl your victory at the screen. It helps, for a time. You forget he's gone when you make others disappear. You feel good, like a craftsman at his forge. Death isn't random and impersonal but controlled and handed out to the deserving. It's odd but you think you can understand better the grim nature of the reaper. His quiet pride at a job efficiently performed. Their offlane feeds for the 10th time, he's given up, his team are in the depths of despair and voicing as much over all chat. You smile at their vitriol, as sweet as cotton candy. The work is never done. Control over others at the click of a button. Satisfaction on tap. It won't last.  

More time passes. You get good enough to play for the pros. You aren't good enough to stay. You reached your peak somewhere down the line. Other's didn't. Your abilities faded, for your opponents it surged. Easy victories give way to hard fought wins. Hard fought wins become tight affairs. Tight affairs become demoralizing losses. Demoralizing losses spiral into a string of red. Your mother has started crying again but you long ago ceased to care. Only the work matters, sweet very rarely, harsh all too often. You hit the bottle. 

You have seen the depths of hell. It is not a cosmic place, a locale made by a divine hand. It is man made, only man could devise such a human portal into suffering. So sweet and tempting, so harsh and filled with light. They enter willingly and stay reluctantly. A perfect trap, an exquisite torture device. The lord of fallen angels watches with envy. Who can tolerate this den of toxicity, this mire of spite and hate. Mistakes are forever, perfection fleeting. Consistent victory a mere mirage, only tilting is eternal. The trench stretches into the vast horizon of infinity. 9.3k MMR average but doesn't know how to pull a camp. Alien species secretly harvest the emotion generated to fuel their empires. You can only survive by ignoring everyone, what do they know anyway? Who are they to preach to the reaper? You've learnt how to insult someone's mother in Japanese. You think on the void. You try to forget your father. You press accept. 

Your time is done. You know it. They know it. You struggle to reach the peaks of your youth. The perpetrator becomes the victim. You've plummeted from such heights but still you refuse to relinquish your struggle. You can now conduct a hateful argument in 10 different languages but you can't tell the French girl at the 7/11 you like her. You can tell when a game is lost before the teams have even spawned at fountain. You can phrase opinions as if they were facts like a pro. You can seethe fruitlessly with the best of them. You type furiously as your throne explodes as their Techies spams voicelines. At surface level all you can feel is rage. Deeper down you see your own madness reflected in his. One broken by his inability, the other enshrining his own as if it will last forever. You know better. It doesn't help. What would your father say? You shudder. Better not to think on it. Better to dwell on better times. You lean back in your chair, and take another swig. So you take yourself away. Past victories. Gone glory. Some sweet to dull out the harsh. But even those days blur. You can barely remember them now they seem so distant. You have to go further. So imagine, if you would, that you're at the fair with your father...

TLDR - Go on, try it. You'll never forget."

This game become enjoyable to me because my friend and random is so supportive when I am in learning phase. Thank you Valve for creating a great game and building wholesome community.
25495,Dota 2 is like League of Legends. League of Legends is like Dota 1. There is no better MOBA than Dota 2. I've tried them all. Dota 2 has superior game mechanics but less booba bazoinga boinga bing bong bibbly bobblies. Take your pick tho you sweaty nurdz.

Valve showed zero interest in resolving this even though there was a very clear paper trail of this - the trade log shows it all and the items still being in that hacker's profile. This is thousands of dollars that I had sunk into this game over 8 years. I've attended majors, minors, the International and promoted this game to friends for a long time. And to get this treatment from Valve really turned me off. Their greed is absolutely disgusting."

25588,"Development team is definitely lacking skill / vision to make this game comfortable.

Not people, but matchmaking is the major problem here. Not competitive matchmaking - human one. No matter how friendly you are, once every 10-20 games you'll get toxic ruiners in your team. Sometimes for multiple games in a row. The game itself is cool though."
25589,"Matchmaking sucks, too many account buyers who ruins games due to low skill play but in higher ranks."
25590,"Worst experience I have had with a multiplayer game:
- The most toxic community I have had to witness so far. There will be verbal harassment from both teammates and opponents in every game and in every skill bracket. I am not exaggerating.
- Requires a lot of time (thousands of hours) to get somewhat good. If there is a game, that is worth investing so much time and energy in, to just grasp the basics then it is definitely not this one. 
- Dota will drain all your energy and will make you emotionally unstable, giving no sense of fulfillment or achievement in any way.

If you have never played Dota, you have not been missing out on anything, and there is no reason to start playing Dota now."
25591,"worst community ever saw in all these years. full of mean players and there is no control on the communities. ruining games,griefing and false language is all you can get from this game. never even try to test this game.

The game is also balanced for most matches. All characters, items etc are free and available to play with.

Adding the other total hours I have from multiple accounts, I have about 3000 hours worth of my life dedicated to this game as it is akin to meth, you know that it's bad for your mental health but you just keep doing it.

Overall, it is a 15/10 game as mechanics-wise if you got it down to the bone and able to make plays it is rewarding. High risk (losing your shit) high reward (feel like a god)."

It's sometimes just part of peoples vocabularies.
Great if you want to know what entitled people in third world countries think of white people (SEA server)
Report 5000 people and it makes no difference, you end up getting into 1 game with a team of racist fillipinos and you lose 1k conduct summery for winning and not even talking to your team once.

Games is wildly addictive, but extremely toxic.

26050,"Played for 2 weeks, maybe 30 matches. Never used chat, not even one time. Always played to the best of my ability, never cheated, never griefed, nothing. I was just trying to learn the game and get better at it. Got an overwatch penalty out of nowhere for unexplained reasons and matchmaking was disabled for 8 hours. 

First time I've ever had this problem in a game before, and to have it within the first two weeks is not good. Especially for no reason. Why wouldn't this just keep happening? If it happens for no reason once, surely it will again. 

I'm out. I don't have time for that nonsense. I'll play a game that doesn't throw me random bans for no reason with no explanation, for example every other game ever."

26092,"When you start this game you will be 10 times worse than the lowest setting bots (Passive). 

You hop on unranked and get laughed at by many people who feel you are truly less than them, with few who tell you you're doing good for your first day playing. People tell you to ask for guides and to ask specific questions on your build so they can help you instead of make fun of you.

You watch 2 hours of Alexander Coccia (Funny guy, great beginner guide) and you start to understand the very basics of the game that you thought you wouldn't need to know. Feeling the tips of these videos and understanding more about gaining exp, you feel a sudden urge to hop back on and attempt to utilise your new-found knowledge.

You hop back into unranked solo, get queue'd with people who are over level 300 in the battlepass and somehow do worse as you feed your lane while attempting to deny and last hit creeps as your support camps behind tower and calls you a bot, saying just don't get hooked by pudge and watching you get 2v1'd.

After a few more games and some DATOHLEONG vids, you realise that to be mediocre in the game you need an extensive knowledge of the matchups of over 100 characters, as well as a sincere desire to be viewed as less than a human for playing unranked and not bots-

26197,"Coming from League, this game feels like League in Season 6. Everything feels so outdated; and there are unnecessarily stupid mechanics that really just ruin gameplay. Tutorial feels pretty weird.... But what can you expect. To be honest, if you are looking for a MOBA, this is NOT it. (100% not biased)"
26198,Awesome!
26199,"Best game ever. Be cautious of your mental health when playing the game, it ruined mine."
26200,"From a veteran LoL players perspective:

Been playing the MOBA genre for a long time. I played LoL for years before trying out Dota, making it to Plat 1 back during Season 8. 

Thought I'd give Dota a try after LoL lost some of its integrity, I put 100 hours in for the ranked queue, and then played another 50 or so before writing this review.

First, nothing is really balanced in this game. You'll die to stuff that you literally had to ability to counter. You also can't surrender, and this is honestly the worst part of Dota. You're stuck in a game dieing over and over for 45 minutes. It just is not fun at that point. Atleast you can FF at 20 in league.

I won't lie and say I did not have fun, but this is one of those games where losing feels 500% worse than winning feels good. Yeah, close games are fun, and it's cool to battle it out with your friends, but most games are not like that. Usually, it's a stomp in either direction, and the worst part is that it is often UNPREVENTABLE. 

You can't stop your team from dieing, getting caught out, building the wrong items, or ganking your lane and dieing. So, even if you play well, you still have to deal with the 8/0 laner in mid that has posted a tent up next to your lane. 

It's just like every moba-you have to try to last hit creeps, its super snowbally, and it simply is not fun to lose. League of Legends is better because there's actually some semblance of balance in it. Yes, champions can get fed and high level, but nothing compared to Dota. I don't think I have ever, except in bot games in League, seen a champion that is literally double my level. Can't say the same for Dota-as a matter of fact, it's common for people to sit 50-75% above your level, especially as support. 

Really, the mechanics in this game just are not fun. Some hero's are ABSURDLY unpowered compared to others, and honestly there is so much un-fun playing against people. Stun for 5 seconds, root for 5 seconds, stun for another 5, silence for 10 seconds,....whats even the point? I can't even play my hero because of this kind of BS.

Your barracks also don't respawn like inhibis do in league, and mega creeps basically make the game unwinnable. XP denial by last hitting is a super annoying mechanic to an already absurdly tedious part of the game. This is the other thing-last hitting SUCKS in dota. attack animations are extremely different between hero's, and misclicking on friendly creeps or heros makes your hero stop, often resulting in a death.

Pulling creep wave onto monster camps is also just a un-fun mechanic that makes losing even worse. Yeah, in league they can freeze wave, but eventually it will push. In Dota, you literally will not get the gold or xp for a wave when that is like the ONE thing that actually enables consistent progression.

The hero kits are also just not thoughtful either. Atleast in League it feels like champions abilities synergise. Dota just slaps together some abilities and calls it good. 

Ranked role queue also doesn't make any sense. I have to play 100 hours to even try ranked, and when I do I'm forced to select a support role. What the hell is the point of role queue when to even play I'm forced to queue for a position I never play?? 

MOBA's are toxic, as most online games are. Still, Moba's attract a certain group of people that flame in unique ways. I was no stranger to this, coming from League, but the difference in dota is that you get flamed for playing even slightly out of line with your roll. For example, I read a long article about LoL players getting into Dota, and how there was less rigidity in role's than League, but I found the opposite to be true. Your position in game mineaswell be a genetic trait. 

Buyback is also a generally annoying feature because it often punishes the winning team. Atleast in League when you ace the enemy team you can push objectives.

But if I had to pick one thing about this game that really seals the deal for my uninstall, it's the developers complete disregard for a balanced experience. There's heros that teleport all over the map, turn invisible every 5 seconds, literally become immortal every 20 seconds, become immune to everything your hero does,  and ultimately create a feeling of helplessness. 

That's why I quit this game.  I have over a thousand hours on LoL and Rocket League. Over 300 on GTA online, 500+ on Call of Duty, thousands on runescape, and over 500 on Age of Empires. Yes, in every single one of those games, there's really annoying stuff that can make gameplay unfun, but Dota makes me feel helpless to it. It's like when I play this game, I anticipate not having fun because of the presence of certain hero's. 

I know there's plenty of people with tons of hours on this game who can devise counter play for every fathomable situation, but ask yourself this. Is it fun to play around the enemy's global silence that prevents you from using any abilities for 5 seconds, in addition to their 3 five seconds stun, as well as their hero that literally can't die? 

To me, no. When 80% of the hero's in this game have straight up cancerous kits, I don't want to play. Why would I want to? What's the point? I can play very well all game, only to be stunned for 10 seconds from the other f*** side of the map, and then exploded to zero HP. What is the counterplay to that?? Heck, there's been games where the enemy team is so fed that my team can't even fight them in the spawn where we are getting healed and they are taking constant damage.

tl;dr DOTA is a game that will make you feel helpless and forced to learn and play around mechanics that are not fun. The most fun part of the game is mid game fighting where both teams are on a semi-even playing field. This is where people get creative with their positioning, items, invisibility, and hero strengths and weaknesses. The sad part is that 90-99% of the game experience is not that. Instead, it's doing tedious things like killing creeps and farming, tiptoeing around broken hero's that are ungodly fed, sitting under tower sweatily trying to last hit and regen hp, along with playing a walking simulator. 

Do yourself a favor and play something else. 1-5% of this game is fun. The rest is honestly terrible."

26225,"after 50hrs playing dota : 

Dota is a real meaning of MOBA. This game always has something to learn ü§åüèªIf you have someone that you are very in tune with and can easily play with, it is a very enjoyable game, but if you do not have that person ...

after 500hrs playing dota : 

The game is great, but this game community is toxic and it gets hard with new players, the game does not do anything for new players to learn the game, it just forces them to pay for skins and battle passes.

Do you see players with accounts since 2013, or do you see players with more than 7,000 hours played, compared to players with 200 games played, and the only reason for this is that the ""mmr"" number of these two players is equal.

I do not call it balanced ranking system.

Players have to play at the level they are at, not just with a ""MMR"" number, their level of play is determined, and it is very easy for people with a higher level of play to play at a lower MMR, and it is very difficult for newplayers (people who are less than 1000 hours of play) to improve their game skills or so-called ""rank up"" themselves. In my opinion, ""rank up"" now means only increasing the number based on winning and losing games and the level of skill of the players will not improve."

26387, it`s more fun in dota 2
26388,.
26389,"As a (previous and current) League player, I must say Dota 2 is indeed a better MOBA game.  Perhaps the only drawback is that it's too addictive...

Edit: League and DotA 2 are two different games and it is not fair to claim that one is better than the other, and let's just say that I love both games equally.  DotA 2 is better at its versatility, in a sense that the game can be much more variable and unpredictable with the active skills of the items and there's always a chance for a comeback whereas this is less likely in League especially when a team is really behind.  DotA 2 focuses on its game mechanics, for instance every hero could initiate a fight with the purchase of a blink dagger, whereas League focuses on the more trivial parts like farming and positioning and each champion has a comparatively more unique characteristic and playstyle.  

Anyway, my point is that it is barely possible for one to claim one game is better than the other.  Both games are great and fun!"

26449,"Hands down Dota2 has the greatest depth, gameplay variety, most different game experiences from one game to another.

+ It has the most hyped moments, the most impressive plays, the funniest fails, 
+ It is more friendly to a wide range of ages, whether your strong points are quick and mechanically complicated plays or whether you are not as quick but you have patience and you are strategic, methodical.
+ The game graphics support its ""meaty"" gameplay feel, ultimate abilities have a huge impact.
+ There are a lot of heroes and they are wildly different and unique.
+ All the heroes are free there is no paywall, no real pay to win, it's only pay to look fancy and sparkly.
+ The items are also unique and impactful, these are not straight power-ups, these are solutions to problems your team faces or will face  (Dota also provides in game ability to follow other player-created builds that work out very well 90% of the games)
+ Huge modding scene.
+ Watching replays of your own games or anyone else's games or watching pro matches or just watching high-ranked player matches is super easily accessible.
+ there are multiple alternative game mods you can play, they offer a unique way of playing and  secretly help you learn the game better
+/- The game is receiving updates, some are negatively received other ones are very welcomed, the changes specifically after longer periods of not playing- can be very refreshing but they can also make you feel fallen out of the loop.

- Patience is required, if you have non you will suffer till you learn it.
- If you don't already play MOBA games- you will have to be able to overcome your worst version of yourself to succeed or just to be able to have fun with the games whether you win or lose.
- Your fuckups will be painfully apparent to you and to anyone else who is watching, you will occasionally singlehandedly lose the whole game.
- People will be critical of your mistakes, tho that is hardly a rare thing in competitive team games/sports.
- it takes couple thousand hours to start to feel that you are somewhat competent at the game on the upside- you are never bored.
- Anyone can and will make mistakes in this game.

From my point of view, Dota is the most fleshed out and the most fun MOBA to play, nothing stands close to it."

"
26496,"i laughed for over half an hour.

My only problem with it is that the hard difficulty (the only difficulty I played on) is similar to halo 2 on legendary, where the enemies do stupid amount of damage. But that's understandable due to the age of dota 2 and it's game engine, and what not the had accessible at the time.

As of now, its the best game FOR FREE that I own,  as there is much to know to succeed. The story is lack-lustre, yet gameplay, level design (mostly lol), is just so amazing and I wish games were still made with such care and love.
this game, is so amazing, and so cheap! CHEAP CHEAP CHEAP!

Looking back now, the period from 2014 to 2016 was probably my favourite time for Dota 2.  Talent tree system was re-introduced from classic, (*cough* growing pains *cough* ) ultimately a huge loss for the game. Micro-transactions are no longer micro, and so on.

Really just go and buy it.

26500,"Solid game, native linux client is a bonus"
26501,"Playing Dota 1 since 4.67 patch and Dota 2 for 7 years range in my lifespan was not positive experience. The community is very toxic and matchmaking was very unbalanced at the time when I was playing. Every match the teammates start flaming each other or one another, which later results in loss. Report system was not working properly and most of players were not getting banned. Over many of years playing of Dota 2 there were constant updates that were messing up the champions (making others broken and others weak, or reverse).

There were various items for champions and it was very overwhelming to buy each champion items  or farm every battle. They are basically worth pennies now and all purchases I have made are worthless now. 

Ranking system is very unbalanced when you are high rank, highest I got was 5400 at the time of playing and there were only a few high rank players that were playing as a group and making the matchmaking was very slow to find. It took about +15 minutes of waiting.

After quiting this game and watching the Dota 2 series movie coming into realization that there are other players who have the same struggle as me. I have quit playing Dota 2, have not played for about 5 years. I do not reject, and am being happy to quit this toxic community and addiction of the game I had. 

Be happy outside, build new friends and play other games! Thank you for reading."

Dota is a game which trains your tactical thinking and it is also a game which makes you better at memorising combinations and pressing buttons. Unfortunately sometimes you have to deal with the toxicity, muting toxic players may be the solution but to be honest this game is more enjoyable to play with friends instead of randoms.

26797,"Worst community and low skill players i ever seen of my entire life. Nobody playing his role, totally chaos.

I spend so many $ and time for this game (sorry i said game for this shit) and i finally became guardian but i lost all my rank in two or three days because of griefers and shit matchmaking system.

You can't play early hours because there is no quality game. You can't play on the weekends because full of griefers and newbie players.

If you are a carry hero get ready for this you have to make all deward, smoke, gank, etc. Because support player can say ""I'm the carry because i have DPS so fu"" and after that he is gonna steal your cs, exp and evantually you gonna die because of him for sure. 

For an example: Strict solo Q is not working. Therefore; I am matching all the time with party players. I am a guardian but matching with HERALD 1 players all the time (most of games) and opposit team full of guardian 2-3 (1/18 summary for my team in average) and end of the day disgusting game and people. 

Mostly you have just 5-7 report for whole week. If you used all your reports, you can report any player until next week :D Everytime every fucking time i used all my reports in one day. Because of GRIEFERS.

What i learn dota 2; totally ruining your day and time and your mental stability.

And nobody is speaking english too. If you wanna play you have to know russian for sure. They are like in the chat ""cxnbnmzxnm cxvnbmnmb cvnmbcvnbm"" all the time for a god sake."

26805,"I have had an on-again off-again relationship with this game for many years, when it is fun it is really fun, but when it is not it is hard to not get frustrated. The inability for people to self sort by region is debilitating, how are you supposed to enjoy a game when within 2 minutes you are being yelled at in Spanish or Russian?

26813,"If dota2 doesn't want to filter better quality people the game is going to die soon.

I have been playing for almost 6,000 hours yet I am still in herald two stars. Then why am I wasting so much time?

All of them are herald 2, yet the worst and the most nonsense people will be in my team!?

If you want to treat ranked matches seriously then you have to make the players commit to it.

First of all, non English speakers should not be allowed in the NA servers. Like LOL they limited the player to their servers!
If you don't want to do that, at least make sure these people understand English! And most important thing is the make them commit to it. I played for so long and these people are not even improving???

There should be a system to rate one player's skill in a game.
With the rating then the match making then make sense.
The current report system is meaningless."

26902,Gosh darn how do people enjoy this genre. Seriously no idea how to have fun with this one
26903,"come and play!
"
26904,"Not gonna lie, I only wrote this to get awards"
26905,"TLDR this is like being in middle school thinking you might like to play football, and then getting dropped into an arena football league with a bunch of angry bastards who want to humiliate you and make you quit. It's not worth the grief, play pretty much anything else.

Are you already really good at this game? No? Then go find something else to do. It is filled with small angry people who have no patience for anyone who isn't professional. They will offer you lots of helpful advice, such as:
""YOU BOUGHT THAT ITEM?!?! WITH THAT CHARACTER!!! ARE YOU AN IDIOT?"" 
""Why do you keep dying?""
""SMFH... Worst player I've ever seen""
""You should delete this game and die""

And that's after you actually start getting positive KD spreads. Players love to look in your inventory and scrutinize your decisions, ping the hell out of you when you fail to save their ass, or they just don't like what you're doing. But don't worry, they won't offer you helpful, actionable advice, just yell at you like children. 

Also, Valve can fuck off with its reporting system. There's no appeal function, so for example, when my power dipped during an ice storm and I lost my connection, but was able to get back into the game a few minutes later, it still counted that as an ""abandon"" and I got stuck in ""low priority"" purgatory. When you're in low priority, you have to win three matches to get out, which is terrible if you're not very good, because everyone else is there for abandoning games, so they will just leave if things aren't going well. I think in took me over 10 matches to get out of it. Again, for losing my connection, but making it back into the match before it ended. That was almost 10 hours spent wondering why I was wasting my time. ""It'll get better..."" I told myself. 

And I did get better, but god forbid you want to try a new character and you don't absolutely dunk it on your first try. Players will eat your face. And, the savvy ones have figured out that they can complain about you in game unlimited times and trigger the overwatch system, resulting in a complete, unquestioned 4 hour ban. Now, it will ultimately be reversed when an actual human watches the recording of the game and realizes you didn't do anything, but if I have time to play video James now... then I probably don't have time in four hours, meaning one asshat can ruin your plans to play, just because they think you play like shit. It's complete and utter nonsense. 

The fact that you can't play ranked games until you've played for 100 hours is insane. So instead of playing against other people who might ostensibly be around your same skill level when your getting started, you just get paired up with any ole body. So you get to be all the fish in the barrel. And most of the people in there have logged thousands of hours on this game, and they cannot fathom anyone not having done the same. There's a ""beginner mode"" where they let you choose out of the 10 most boring characters and then have you play against bots with names to make you think you're playing with and against real people. I played there, not realizing that, until I was pretty consistently getting mvp, and then decided to graduate and realized that the bots played nothing like real people, and that being mvp there still means your garbage in the regular game. 

I would like Valve to refund the hours of my life I wasted on this horrible game. It was better as a custom map for WC3. I wish there was an ""absolutely not"" option for the recommendation.

26957,Looking for a skill based game that you will devote thousands of hours to just to realize that there is so much more to learn and perfect? This game is great for you. Not recommended if you play other games that fit that description because there are only 24hrs in a day. I like this better than many other MOBAs because it isn't pay to win like LoL. The only things you can pay for add gamemodes that give you no real benefit other than cosmetic items for your heroes. You can also pay for cosmetic items in general and that is what is nice. The creators have to keep the lights on somehow and it isnt by making a pay to win game. 10/10

26990,In general Dota 2 is still the classic that we all love and remember but the unwillingness of the the people that are in charge of upgrading and improving the game to remove some TOXIC heroes/mechanics it destroys the experience. Techies should have been removed like 10 years ago and the hero is still in the game and still destroy the fun for 9 out of 10 players in the game.

27166,"I used to play this game religiously during the dota 1 days,came back again years later in the mid of 2019 after randomly installing it out of boredom during the pandemic, here's a few words I can share regarding the game from my experience in the past 2 years as well as it being a parting letter in a way.  

Playing again after a long time I didn't really spend much time on the game intitially then after 2-3 months the same person that use to skip riding bus for the half hour playing time of cyber cafe came back again.

This game will cripple all your ambitions outside of dota,seeing yourself slowly deteriorating mentally and physically day by day, by the time you noticed all your mannerism and your outlook for others would change maybe that was always within who knows, mentally killing at least 100 people by your 1000th hour and several more as your in-game time increases.

 Maybe I'm not ranking up cause of my hero pool, maybe it's my mentality, maybe maybe maybe it's the server that I'm playing in full of DIVERSE personalities,maybe it's all of the above and if I can work it out MAYBE I'll make it out and win the big million.

I've never been more passionate and absolutely hate a thing at the same time in my entire life, The only thing I regret would be not achieving immortal as a parting gift (divine 2), Ironically the only thing I regret would be not playing more.

The saying ""there's always a good and a bad side to everything"". Dota is the epitome of that saying. Best vedio game of all time no doubt. 

In conclusion I would absolutely recommend the game 10/10."

I like that you dont need to be part of a guild and go on raids to get items  - so every game starts equally.

Weither people want to admit it or not, this game ruins your fucking life. I spent thousands and thousands of hours playing this game just to get ABSOLUTELY NO WHERE. THOUUSSANNDSS OF HOURS OF MY LIFE. ROUGHLY 2 YEARS... GONE!!!!!!!! They give you their fancy little stupid fucking badge to judge how ""skilled"" you are at the game, right?? Makes sense. Only problem is the game is completely nuked with smurfs at lower ranks! They make it nearly impossible to move up, BECAUSE YOU NEED TO WIN TO GET FANCIER BADGES............. HARD TO WIN WITH A BUNCH OF SMURFS THAT BEEN PLAYING SINCE 2012, ISNT IT?!?!?!?!?!?! YA. OOOHHH AND THATS NOT THE BEST PART FELLAS. EVEN IF YOU DO GET LUCKY AND WIN A SHIT TON OF MATCHES, THEY HAVE ""RECALIBRATION"" AT THE END OF EVERY SEASON (6 MONTHS I THINK???) AND U NEED TO ""RECALIBRATE"" YOUR SKILL LEVEL. IF YOU DONT DO WELL, THAT BADGE THAT U EARNED OVER THE COURSE OF 6 MONTHS GETS..... TAKKKEEENN AWWWWWWAAAAY!!!!!!!! YUP THATS RIGHT. THEY RIP YOUR BADGE FROM YOUR COLD DEAD FINGERS, AND GIVE U SOME SHITTY LOW LEVEL BADGE AGAIN!! BACK TO SQUARE 1.

Highly recommend - but it comes at a cost. One must be mentally prepared and develop tolerance in order to play this game filled with lots of toxic players around. 

DOTA became my coping mechanism & I'm glad it did (no sarcasm intended). I am now mentally stable - though people in-game tilt me (sometimes) LMAO. Met quite a few good friends in-game where we've shared some very fun and memorable moments. Thank you DOTA 2."

27220,"I've played since Dota was in WIII.  I have nothing but good memories from this game. When it came out I couldn't wait to jump in.  I had around 1200 hours in game when I stopped playing.  Mostly due to life, and lack of people to play with as most of my friends are on console.  I try to come back, but honestly, I wasn't great to start and coming back after so many changes is daunting.  I mostly get on and play bots as I am afraid of getting flamed by my teammates lol.  Overall its a great game and will always recommend it.  Maybe one day I'll have the courage to come back to my favorite game of all time."

Bad waste of money. The developers obviously did not try, there are only 500 levels, there is no ""card"" as a prize for reaching the level, only things for Trax and Mirana.
Aghanim's Labyrinth is a major disappointment. A solid field of bugs, not fully thought out, poorly made levels. The developers took up the scale, which they could not pull out. Difficulty levels are very poorly designed. The last difficulty levels are too difficult for the players, the only way to get through is by using bugs.
I put a dislike and a low rating for the last collection.
Aghanim's Labyrinth has no replacement card for the main card and much bugs."

27244,Really bad matchmaking with really bad players with no options to adjust it. The leveling is really bad and there are ZERO connections between it and the skills of the players. Probably lots of player use boosting... Random bugs with last hits and ranges. If a player exits the game u are obligated to still play the game although its pointless... after so many years and u still aren t able to make a decent matchmaking algorithm... and the level of unbalancing that u can find on heroes is mindblowing...

27288,its best game on all time life :)
27289,"Oki, lets make it real - I have over 10 plus years experience on League of Legends and even tho people will hate on Dota if they are League players I cant do it. The game itself has a lot to offer and it's actually fun to play but the biggest downside is that I dont understand 99% spells even after 100 plus hours. The game is fun and i'm in love with Pudge/Invoker or Rubick. I always love to watch international even tho I have no clue whats happening. Good game, but I cant be good at it even tho I'm very experienced player in MOBA games. 


For newbies in MOBA games - Both of the games are good no matter if it's League or Dota. But if you really want to push yourself up.. stick with League because it feels more easier to achieve something in the game than in Dota (because Dota feels extremely hard even tho people says that League is harder.. which doesnt reflect my thoughts about it.. - maybe i just didnt spend a lot of time on Dota?..)"

27324,bad game why? becuse yes
27325,.
27326,"Just follow these rules to play DOTA2:

How to act like a pro:
1. Make sure you have an intimidating nickname ""ex: EZ RAMPAGE""
2. Pick mid carry or gay offlaner that u have GOOD/EXPENSIVE set
3. Say something scary (CapsLock :ON) ""LET ME MID..TY"" or ""I GO SOLO BOTTOM/TOP""
4. Predict win!
5. Just lasthit like a pro (spamming ""S"")
6. When u feed just type ""WTF LAG"", when u got kill/ killsteal remember to laugh on all chat ""HAHAHAHAHA""
7. When u win the game just say ""EZ GAME""

How to cumback the game:
#Normal Strategy
1. Remain calm and def inside.
2. Go rat game! Buy manta/necro and boots of travel.
3. Split push and wards anywhere.
4. Gank their opponent MVP w/ smoke until have no buyback.
5. Final push, there it is!

#TrashTalk Strategy
1. Blame their opponent carry can not fast end or have an ugly profile picture.
2. Call ""ggwp no def, no buyback, end please!""
3. Chat to all, said ur team are noobs and kids!
(there's phase your opponents underestimate your team and goin have fun with silly items build)
""Space created~""
4. Then tells to your team. ""Relax, you're doing fine"", ""Game is hard"", and ""Don't give up!"".
5. Communicate to your team ""we need teamwork"". Who's tanker (blade mail / lotus), innitiator / disabler (dagger), carry / hitter (bkb), support heal / defensive aura (meka / pipe / etc) and rescuer (force staff / glimmer & wards)
""insert your combowombo dream plans here""
6. Dream team here we go.

27346,"Whoever made rules of moderation for this game is an idiot. You mean to tell me I have to waith for the game for 15 minutes and when the game finally comes up I have to be ready to click in a minute or I WILL BE PUNISHED FOR NOT READYING UP?

You think we are your slaves? I want to play this game however the game may be imperfect bit those rules are just idiotic. 

Another thing is, when 4 random idiots from THE PLANET EARTH decide I have done something bad in the game I get punished although I did my best, and maybe those idiots were not playing their best games so they decided I was to blame for other reasons of eny, etc... 

Please fix this and the game will have some value. If not I am going to stop playing it. Although I want to play it occasionally, you know, not LIKE A MANIAC, just to play. Not to be hooked on it and PAY FOR THE DLC... ;)"

Just tell people they're being toxic, and usually they'll stop, as everyone in DOTA wants DOTA to be the best MOBA with the best community. Ask for suggestions, instead of insults. This is a game with nigh infinite replayability."

27459,"its all a disaster, +-30 every game is a joke (every match is perfectly balanced apparently), the game is filled with either boosters, smurfs, acc buyers, or people who are delusional enough to think their mmr fluctuations are them playing better or worse. Don't tie your self worth to the colour of your medal, or do."

27464,It's DotA. ALL OF THE CHARACTERS ARE FREE. It is the most polished and balanced of the MOBA genre. They have selected possibly the worst marketing and dev team for something that is so incredibly successful on its own. Download it. Get 4 people to play. Have a ball. It's an amazing game and every match is different.
27465,"Friendly community always willing to help new players, especially russians, great people. 
Now for real. If you want to get rid of LoL to start playing DotA- do it. It's worth it. You will gain at least 2 brain cells, maybe 3 if you mute chat."

27468,"Honestly, terrible. This was once a game worth playing for its competitive integrity and deep gameplay, but it's absolutely gone to shit. Heroes are literally unidentifiable under layers of hats and particles. Core mechanics have been completely changed into less interesting versions of themselves. Every hero has been given access to such similar tools that roster diversity has diminished massively. Quality of life features necessary to best enjoy the game have been locked behind a subscriber system. I'm sure I'll end up with more hours on my account after this due to addiction or trying it again, but jesus dodge this shit.

Avoid."

27547,"I don't think that I will state anything new in this review, since it was reviewed by many people who played this game better then I do, and understand this game better then me. But I must state some things. From my experience, this game is probably the hardest game I ever played. First you need to understand it completely to be able to play as efficient as possible. If you don't do that, you will always be a lower bracket toxic player cause you don't know why your teammates did something, and you blame them for your loss even though they are not a guilty party here. You are.

Second - I tried to play competitive Dota, didn't get very far, played some small tournaments, but boy, the actual team play is another level of game play here. If you synced with your teammates and you have them on Teamspeak or any other software to help you communicate with a headset, your knowledge and understanding of the game will rise exponentially. A completely new level of this game. And I love that part. Sure, you will still lose the games, and other teams may play better then you, but you will learn so much here.

3rd. Even if you don't have a team, communication is everything. If you don't speak English, don't go to English language servers. If you don't speak Russian, don't go to the Russian server. It is as simple as that. You will not find glory elsewhere if you didn't find it in your own language area. You need to learn to communicate everything inside the game. Be it public game, or teamplay. It is critical to winning anything. 

And finally, my closing word. Don't be toxic, ever, towards anybody in this game. It will get you nowhere. You need to be polite, well mannered, everybody wants to win a game, help them out, rather then complaining all the time and being negative. If others are toxic towards you, mute them and play to your best knowledge of the game ever. Watch what team is doing. Don't jungle your next item if your team is fighting a fight. Go out, help the team, take down the tower, then maybe go back to the jungle. Or even better, take out the Roshan. Feel what team needs.

Good Luck and Goodspeed to anybody who is still playing this game. I had enough. 5000 hours was more then enough, I need my chill now, I am off to play the Euro Truck SImulator 2, but for those about to rock, we salute you."

27574,"After playing this game for 5 years off and on, I have decided to uninstall. This has become the most toxic and frustrating game I have ever played. It is impossible to play a game nowadays without one person ruining the whole game. The servers do not separate people of differing languages. Making communication impossible and usually leads to trash talking. Wait times can be 10-30 minutes depending on what roles you queue, all to be ruined by one person and endure a game just to wait again. Never again, play a game where the entire community doesn't have toxicity as their main trait."
27575,"Crashes very frequently fps drops down to unplayable levels every few minutes,doesent let you reconnect quite commonly,extremely toxic fanbase,if you get a crash and dont reconnect in time (which is difficult since reconnecting is a pain) you get blocked from playing for hours on end and when you get to play you only have one gamemode which you can only play assigned characters which are randomized and you HAVE TO WIN making it almost impossible to get to play normally unless you get boosted.
Smurfing is also a major issue.
DO NOT PLAY AT ANY COST"
27576,Community is still as abusive as ever. Don't play this game if you want to relax.

That being said, if you are new...please watch tutorials, or use the ones they put in. Play with bots and play turbo or the new player mode. There is nothing more frustrating than your position 5 taking the last hits than blaming you for the loss when they were griefing from 1 minute in. Being bad and willing to try to learn and get better is one thing, but being willfully ignorant and bad is a whole different thing."

27615,"When i first entered in DOTA 2 in 2018, i was welcomed by its community, so i decided to delete it after 2 hours of gameplay. After 2,5 years i decided to reinstall it to play with friends, however i was not understanding the game mechanics, so 10 year old boy started to say some bad thing about me, my family, whole team started to bully me, and after few matches i got in LP, which had even more toxic community, so i decided to stop playing. And most of the time i played the dota, i was in the main menu, so i wasn't sucked in it. Today is 29 january of 2022, i decided to reinstall it and just spend some time on it, hope this time everything will be fine. From this moment I want to spend no more than 300 hours on playing it, since i need to do a lot of things:)."

27685,"During the beginning stages of Dota 2 I didn't consider it an amazing game but it's definitely one of the more progressive and continually evolving. Anyhow, over the last couple (+/-) years, they introduced the Arcade games, which I looooooooove, becoming a reason to return to this game regularly. The one thing I cannnnnnnot stand is their failed punishment system for supposed abandonment of games. It's not uncommon for the game to glitch out or for a slight connection lapse to result in a failed ""Accept"" attempt. You're literally penalising people for your own system's errors, as well as unintentional mistakes and not even offering a method to rescind it. For example, an option to quickly dispute why you couldn't click accept which an automated system replies to. Just ridiculous, especially when your hyped before another shitty day of work or right after a hard shift for example. Literally I give it a 3 out of 5 for A, not tackling a long standing issue and B, making it the consumer's problem doubly so by awarding penalties when none was earnt."

27690,"I've been playing dota 2 for 10 yrs now and havent reached ancient ranked. :D
"
27691,"I played this a long time ago - and even then, not for very long. My verdict after playing this game was ""MOBAs are not for me."""
27692,"[h1] 9/10 [/h1]
Looking back now, my first exposure to Dota was Dota 1 6.78 b version. At the time, I didn't know much about Dota at all, but its fun-filled gameplay still fascinated me at the time. July 15, 2014, was the first time I came into contact with Dota 2. Compared with Dota 1, Dota 2 not only optimized a lot in UI, model, operation, and experience, but the version update after that has also kept Dota 2 alive. Looking back now, the period from 2014 to 2016 was probably my favorite time for Dota 2. At that time, there was no clear role positioning, and I mostly knew little about the game. In the end, it took more than 2,000 hours, and I only got about the rank of archon 4, which was 2800MMR at that time. The 7.0 version update is the biggest change for DOTA. The newly added talent tree system and various game updates even made many people call this game Dota 3 at that time. While the game keeps getting better, my interest in Dota 2 has been dwindling ever since. The changes are too big, and I don't have much time to understand these changes. Many times I will find that my understanding of heroes and items is still stuck in the previous version. Around 2019, I temporarily gave up on Dota 2.

Around November 2020, I tried Dota 2 again. With my original understanding of the game, I won Legend IV in the positioning match on this account, 3700MMR. But as I continued to play, I found that the game environment of this game started to get worse and worse. Many Legend and even Ancient players don't even know some basic game operations and awareness, they will make some incredible operations in the ranked match. And there is no longer that kind of tolerance between players. Players who don't understand the content of the game won't listen to other people's advice at all, and even give up on themselves. I'm used to the verbal abuse between teams. After a game is over, many opponents like to type slightly insulting words like Noob, GG EZ, which makes people feel that the game environment full of competitive style in the past is no longer. In addition, although Legend is not a very high rank, I not only find that the matching queue time required here is getting longer and longer, usually, 5-15 minutes or even longer, and this rank has a lot of players who lack understanding of the game also surprised me. After all, the rank of Legend IV can already be in the top 30% of this game, and the rank below this, which I have experienced before, the current rank between 1000MMR and 3000MMR is even more difficult for me to imagine. Undoubtedly, either this is the irrationality of the positioning mechanism itself or the overall decline of the player's level.

These are all my opinions. I also finally decided to give up Dota 2 again, and I'm afraid I won't be coming back. For new players, the learning cost of Dota 2 is too high. At the same time, it only takes 100 hours to play the ranked game in the game, which makes many new players go directly to the ranked game after 100 hours of games, which will destroy the game environment in the ranked match. And now the overall game environment is also full of maliciousness for new players. Many players do not even have a tolerant attitude towards new players in ordinary matchmaking modes, and the content of Dota 2's tutorials is too little. 

I really like Dota 2, and I really agree that it's a masterpiece. But why is Dota 2's user base and word of mouth declining compared to League of Legends now? I think it does have a lot of problems, and those problems are more focused on the game environment. I personally think that this game takes a certain amount of time as a learning cost for new players and Dota old players, and the current game environment is often too harsh. If you want to try it, you must be mentally prepared.

Finally, farewell to you, Dota 2, and thank you for being with me for the 9 years I've read. I will never, never forget you."

27696,"What I really enjoy about this game is the rich combination of heros and items. After playing countless hours of Dota I have thoroughly memorized these synergies. After reaching peak form you can devestate your foes in brutal combat. Another plus, is showing your godliness to your friends who struggle to grasp these combinations; you may choose to mentor them, but can they handle wielding so much power?"
27697,why its so fucking hard to learn ??
27698,It was ok...
27699,League is better. And League is bad. So...
27700,"imbalanced match making, and toxic player base.
you can not go more than 3 games without someone new in your party or against you, that on it self is not a bad thing knowing that new player is part of the game but it is absolutely unfair if your opponents are experienced in the game. usually these players uses an alternative smurf accounts to rake victories, which makes it even demoralizing, especially if they are toxic."

You can improve and play for hours, but the algorithm is built to ensure you a 50% win rate.  As soon as you begin to go above that 50% win rate you will be thrown into a queue that positions you with players that are drastically losing their games in an effort to 1. help their probability of a 50% win rate and 2. bring your win rate back to 50%. Unless you are a smurf that is able to solo carry a game you will not be able to improve your status and this is why the game has such a problem with smurfs.  People create smurf accounts for that very reason. There is no winning in this game regardless of improvement so save yourself the time and don't melt your brain trying to get good at a game that is against you doing so."

They should open rank to everyone so these people who take normal games super seriously can go there and yell at their team mates instead of doing it in normal games."

28041,"this game absolute trash .
it is a rip off of leage of legends and a bad one at that .
the main problem is you cant pick the hero you want you just pick from a pool of pre select heros .
the rest is basically lol but with different heros the other big problem is you have to control the camera with the arrow keys and seeing as the attack moves are from q on witch is on the other side of the key bord you would need 3 arms to play this game at all and calling this thing a game is giving it too much credit .
the people who made this thing should stick to packing grouserys at there local walmart they might be good at that"

28154,"This game is not worth the investment in time to learn or play. It has perhaps the worse community of any online game and suffers from numerous issues related to this community. It boast about having behavior score system yet 0k to 10k behavior score has no difference in game toxicity. It also allows players of very wide rank and skills to queue with each other. I have never see any other game like such a high level player queue with one of shitter friends to carry games for him. This is legal account boosting that has been in the game forever. 

The greatest sin this game commits is being too complex and too team based. The average retard you will get on your team is just not mentally fit enough to play the game properly. Wheras other MOBAs have dumbed down their gameplay to a point where it is barely a MOBA DOTA has retained many of the niche mechanics and game play depths when it first started. I imagined when DOTA 1 was around this was not an issue as it was more niche and players were dedicated and also discovering many new mechanics. Today in DOTA 2 this hardcore complexity means that you will often have players who do not understand the game even after dumping hours into it. They will play with bad tempo, bad picks and bad item builds. After playing a 25 games of the latest league season on a new account I saw perhaps one or two bad builds but these were newer level players and unranked matches and no game throwing picks. In 25 games of RANKED DOTA 2 I saw numerous bad builds and picks that were game throwing. Nyx offlane with echo saber, skull basher, and deso. Medusa rushing a swift blink as a first major item. 3 Silencer offlanes. DK offlane rushing a malestrom. The list goes on. It genuinely seems like the game is too complex for the average play to play to have this many examples of awful builds and choices and this is only in builds this is not to mention that many other macro and micro mistakes players will make and mechanical mistakes. The game requires you to rely on 4 randoms to help you complete tasks that a team of pro players that have known each other for years sometimes struggle to execute. There are many heroes and mechanics that simply cannot be pulled off in a pub or in a ranked match. The more you invest into the game the less you get out of it as you find numerous retards around you taking away any work you put in."
28155,fucking game wanna play ?
28156,"Well, what is there to say about Dota... It requires a lot of time to get the basics down, but it's well worth the time. It never gets boring! Be sure to groupe up with friends and allways, ALLWAYS have voice chat, even while playing with complete strangers. Communication is key. No team = no win :)"

28165,"To anyone that might have already assumed it, here is an official explanation on the forced 50%: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgjEMgc96ik

Please note, that this is for a specific mmr range and does not really apply to exceptional players like immortal rank. In summary, the game will always try to keep you at 50% winrate by defining losing and winning teams. This is why often you have a losing or a winning streak 10-20 games in a row. 

Now I want everyone to think about why you play this game? Is it fun for you or do you actually want to gain rank. For me it was a long time about rank and I gained up to 5.2k mmr, often in packets like 400 mmr, but then losing 400 mmr straight away.

Why am I posting this? I want everyone to understand that this game is rigged to the bones (and yes, others are rigged as well). This game is not worth your time and if it is not fun for you, you should not play it. 

DotA 2 is officially rigged and the worst part about it is, that Valve does not officially comment on this, but it is obvious to a degree that it is not even funny. Valve makes fun of all of us with this algorithm like they make fun of the pro scene by just cancelling majors without notice, etc. 

DotA 2 is not worth your time.

I used to play DOTA on Warcraft 3, so was looking for some nostalgia. I enjoyed the team work and strategy of it; where team composition was critical. What I found was a gold grinder where the objective was to get gear to make you impossible to kill then tank your way to victory (or in some cases camp outside spawn and let the creepers take care of the buildings..)"

28302,"I hate this game. But I've been playing it forever because it's my favorita MOBA. The characters are fun, with lots of different options and the meta is changing all the time. The community is...rough, but I've played for long enough to be used to it. Not for the faint of heart."

28305,"Matchmaking is abysmal. You get matched with people who are either way below your level or way above it. The problem is amplified by smurf accounts people buy to stomp your game. I'm level 66 and I get matched with people who are level 3! These are either complete beginners or smurfs. It ruins the experience even if you win the game. Furthermore, the community is toxic and lacks any understanding for failure. Every 5th game is somewhat even or interesting. I wouldn't recommend it to my worst enemy."

28322,"I have been playing Defense of the Ancients since its inception; just like it's mother, Aeon of Strife. There were only a handful of heroes for each side, names were different, there were abilities that no longer exist or moved from one hero to another. I continued to play dota and dota beta custom matches for the next 4 years as I climbed the WC3 TFT ranks into the top 200, always playing dota alongside my normal warcraft 3 matches. 

I was birthed into DOTA alongside a small group of others during Eul's creation and release of the game in 2003. I  suffered through the Guinsoo era, and thrived with the dawn of Icefrog. DOTA is the father of all MOBA games. There are others, but for over 15 years there is one constant that has kept DOTA surprisingly fresh, interesting, and challenging. Icefrog. The man is a balancing guru, expert, veteran, and genius.

As for the game that he has created, there is no other like it for those who are seeking a competitive and challenging experience. With over 100 heroes, each having 4 abilities or more to learn, the game has a STEEP learning curve, but boy is it rewarding. There are roles in DoTA like other moba games, but there is potential for certain heroes to step outside of that boundary and still be a significant force on the battlefield. This allows for more variety and diversity in game, sure there are meta heroes and picks but in DOTA, any team can win. 

If you want to have a frustratingly wonderful and rewarding experience gaming, play dota. The community can be toxic to those who dont try, dota is not forgiving. There is no surrender option, when you play a game of dota you are committing yourself to that game and your teammates, and many of those who play have the winners mentality. If you dont care about losing, maybe dota can help you understand that winning is always more fun. 

All in all, be prepared to spend a decent amount of time learning and understanding the complexities that a game like dota has to offer. At surface level, it may seem pretty shallow, but these waters are deep. There are many tactics that can be used that may seem miniscule but make a huge difference when playing the game. 

If you spend a lot of time playing MOBA games, I strongly feel that you should be playing dota. I have played every other MOBA that has ever come to be. All are mere candles in the light of DOTA; which comparatively, would be like a sun in the sky."

You can have high continuous losing streak even tho you play your role well (i.e. highest/higher net value/stats than your team). Team will flame you even tho:

1) Support taking your farm during early game then blame you for losing.
2) Support doesn't ward and blame you when you always 3v1. (They die relatively early at late game nor even help you at early game including diving tower or deep in jungle)
3) Teaching you how to play when their score/stats is like lowest in the team."

It is very hostile towards new-players, it lack's a working anti-cheat & any reporting method that's useful. Very unbalanced at times. Another commercial fukk-up product."

28385,"Save yourself, its too late for me."
28386,"Been playing this game for a lot of years. Should have been a lot's of rank up if not for the toxic set of players here. This game used to be a lot of fun before, nowadays there are lot of people who purchase higher rank accounts and you don't have enough reports to report all these players, So you end up losing your MMR and Rank eventually. Battle pass ain't good as before. It's like too much money to get good costume sets / other stuffs in the game. Previously as a F2P you get a lot of these good stuffs by playing regularly. Nowadays that's also gone. The only thing you get as a F2P is to get to play with the majority of the toxic community. At some point you'll start wondering why the matchmaking is so stupid that they constantly give you such idiotic players and how come they're not even banned. And you won't have enough reports to report them all as well. But guaranteed playing with them to lower your rank - that's what the game offers. So you get a meltdown at some point and scold some of these players in game. Instead of them getting banned, you'll get communication ban (those toxic players reported you and you got banned for it XD) Crazy right? Their rules and system ain't so perfect. So even the good players eventually end up degrading to a level of toxic player. Unless the system has a strict ban on toxic players who throw games intentionally , who purchase higher rank accounts and ruin others MMR, it won't give you the fun you expect. Rather you'll get a lot of stress by forcibly playing matches thrown by these toxic players - Coz you can't quit in between. That will result in a report on you. Rather you have to painfully watch and play the game that these idiots throw by picking non roles, feeding intentionally, fake account - smurfs and newbies. That's a lot of pain and stress for the fun you expect from the game. Even though every game has it's own share of toxic players, I feel here in the ranked community of Dota 2 it's way more and intolerable. Hopefully the system improves in future to severe ban such accounts. So decide wisely before you dive into this game, if you can handle toxicity you'll be fine. Especially in ranked."

As soon as I started playing Dota, my wife and kids decided to leave me in my house and go to a hotel.
My anger is huge and uncontrollable and sometimes I beat her. The children are scared and tell me to stop, but the alcohol blinds my abilities to stop the beatdown. I also lost 5,000$ into skins. Those damn ""Collector's Caches""... AND THE BATTLE PASSES. YOU COULD ATLEAST MAKE THEM INTERESTING.

I pogchamped when I got my first Aegis IRL, but my wife had to voice her concerns... dumb bitch.

28433,"I got stomped by some dude in turbo who added me and messaged me telling me I was worthless and trash and should never play online again. I said fuck it and told him he was right and that if he had any tips I would love to learn more about the game as I was just starting out. He added me on discord and proceeded to teach me basically everything about Dota 2 and a ton about mechanics and how to recognize certain group formations and adjust on the fly. He played with me for like literally 8 hours, calling me trash the whole time, and then at the end he said he had to get off, I thanked him, he said ‚Äúfuck you scrub‚Äù and left the discord call. He blocked me and I‚Äôve never heard from him since.

Weirdest fucking experience of my life."
28434,Good
28435,"There's a lot of things, (people included), that I truly hate about this game. It has deviated from the original WCIII custom mod experience in many ways, but holds true in just as many fundamental aspects. In my opinion, this is like the adult table at Thanksgiving dinner while LoL and other mobas are the kids table. The depth and complexity are not matched, and I appreciate that. If that offends you or your opinion maybe you should route some of that time spent personally attacking people and their thoughts into furthering your knowledge or preparing a thesis on how I'm wrong. If you're looking for a complex, engaged MOBA, this fits the bill. The skins are cosmetic only, they have free to play options for obtaining skins, and the community is full (albeit toxic in lower MMR). Which brings me to my final point, if you can't handle people talking in foreign languages telling you to choke on a puddle of pig vomit, and you don't have other people to queue with, this might not be a logical choice. If possible, avoid solo queue because, in my experience as of late, low MMR ranked solo queue is impossible to escape. Regardless of how well you do, you're still subjected to toxic players, abandoners, and people who grief/throw the game because  you aren't catering exactly to their playstyle. Not all players are compatible. It's a fact. This is a game where 5 man coordination is absolutely key to victory. Losing one or two of those players creates a cascade that ends in completely and utter destruction of your team, base, and morale. It reaches a point where it is futile to attempt redemption. However, like a drug addict carpet surfing for the fifth time today, I crawl back into the trenches because there's the hope somewhere that this will all end one day. If a game can make me want to play despite my recent, soul-crushing experiences, then there's something in there worthwhile."

28530," The business practices regarding cosmetics in this game are at best predatory at worst it is like EA 2.0. Most cool looking new items are locked behind a big fuck off grind/paywall and backed by constant FOMO that most modern video games employ. Unlike other contemporary MOBAs there isnt even a ""second chance"" item shop, or a rotating shop where you can get it again. They even threw away tradability of most high grade items and new releases arent tradable either. 

The funniest thing is when Ostarion was changed from Skeleton king into wraith king over a dsipute with blizzard. A few years later they turn him back into skeleton king, but you guessed it. It was a high level battlepass arcana item. Not tradable and not marketable.

If you want to play the game, it has pretty good entertainment value if you're into MOBA sweatfests. But dont give valve a single penny. I am well aware that Valve is following the business trend but it doesnt make it any less shit."

28536,Piece of shit from VALVE. Another proof of how a developer can kill an already dead game. Constant problems with cheating and the lack of normal matchmaking makes this game incredibly unattractive for new players. I'll give you just one piece of advice - NEVER PLAY THIS PIECE OF FUCKING SHIT.
28537,"There are too many stupid peruvians. They need to make their own server because they refuse to work as a team. I don't speak spanish and dont ever plan on doing so. SO STOP PUTTING ME IN LOBBYS WITH FUCKING PERUVIANS, GET YOUR OWN SERVER AND STAY AWAY FROM NA EAST OR WEST"

28558,I really start to hate this game Seriously. I accept that when I try hard to play and win and others don't I can be toxic player. Sure. But please. FOR LOVE OF GOD. PLEASE. Check my last few normal games and watch them. See the other players who grief me then punish me. Last game I picked Phantom Assasin. We took first blood which is nice. My support was afk from start. 4.30 min passed game was about to safe to leave. He came back last moment. Grief to lane first. Died 2 times in a row. Then griefed me at whole map. So I stoped to play. I was waiting enemy to finish the game but they didn't so I ran around the map and I GET THE ABANDON. I GET THE FUCKING LOW PRIO PUNISHMENT. Seriously what the fuck is wrong with your systems and community.
28559,Good Game
28560,Best game
28561,GOAT......!!!!
28562,"It's a great game (the best MOBA that I have ever played), but you will need at least 50 hours of gameplay to start understanding what is going on.

10/10"
28563,OG Gamer still love this game
28564,"there a glitch on new game plus, Atreus can't cast hes to abilities for the Stone and electric
fix it right now"
28565,"Overall, this game create harmony."
28566,Recommended. So addictive.
28567,"I played League of Legends and Heroes of the storm for many years. there is no harmony here like them. to be honest i like the map style here rather than LOL rift :D
However; i took a long time to understand the game points and it is not balanced from my view.. for example all here can farm and take items from farming the wilds near the Lanes. also heroes leveling up so high and nearly become inexorable to all attacks. 
Just be late for 2 or 4 min to understand what are u doing and whats going on you will shock with your opponent level !!
I see there is no problem here to play SOLO and be master Hero. i feel may be opp players no need most of the time for great team, JUST they need them alive :D :D (don't die please) because that is feeding too much the enemy team."

28573,game is almost fun
28574,very good
28575,"TL;DR It's a complicated and challenging game, which can be rewarding when you achieve something and there's a sense of progress if you invest a lot of time. By far, the worst aspect is the community.


Positive:
- It's not League:
  * You can play every hero all the time
  * You can demo/test heroes 
  * You can observe any public game from within the client
  * Builtin voice chat (you don't have to be in a premade party)
- There's an internal league called ""Battle Cup""
- Works on Linux
- Allows modding (game arcade)
- Lots of skins and visual enhancements to buy

Negative:
- Very toxic community (lots of screaming, insulting, giving up early, etc.)
  * As a team game, being forced to mute everbody makes it seem like you're playing against bots
- There are so many cheaters because of how the game is built (information about everybody and everything on the map is sent to the client)
- Normal game is veeery slow and people take it way too seriously
- Not friendly at all for beginners (you get flamed incessently for mistakes)
- Game arcade is only alternative but it's:
  * unmaintained
  * buggy
  * ranking system is very bad (game developers pay for their games to have a good rank/visibility)
- There's no clear way to get help

28580,"Probably the best MOBA but i wish they would stop dumbing it down in order to attract the LoL fan base... LoL has it's own magic and so does Dota2, there is no point in trying to change Dota in to LoL, because you can't. There is a reason why YouTube is full of videos titled ""LoL player tries Dota2"" and only a couple titled "" Dota2 player tries LoL"". 

Also, the devs don't care anymore about the stories behind the heroes, their interactions... And we, as a community, feel these changes and how our game becomes more and more just a cash cow. Still, at the moment, i recommend this."

28668,"I decided to try dota 2 and this is what happened. I got reported over and over again for being a new player and not doing well. Mind you it comes up and says at the beginning of the match theres a new player in the game and they still report for poor performance. I then got a ban for being reported and as part of my punishment i can only play single draft mode which will give me a hero i dont know how to play because im new. It wont even let me play new player mode at all (which is vs bots). I waited in que for an hour to play anyways and i still didnt find a game because im "" low priority "" because of my ban. Long story short if youre a new player just forget it, the insults and trash talking was so bad and its in voice you can hear their toxic crap. Really bad experience. And the items screen is just stupid tiny little icons you cant see. Tiny font on everything so you can barely read  it. I could keep going...... ill play this when i get a weird urge or if league is down thats about it.

This is the game that established the MOBA genre. Many have tried to replicate the formula with some success. This original is pitched more towards the hardcore side, with many of it players having played the original DOTA from Warcraft 3 customs maps. 

Should you play it? Only if you've tried the other more casual moba's and want something more punishing!!"

28736,"I wouldn't recommend this game to anyone. used to be one of the best games on here a long time ago but Valve have destroyed it. i cant remember the last time i had fun playing this game.

every game its the same story, either players don't play their lane, their role, go afk or purposely do everything they can to make sure you lose the game.  I thought things would get better after introducing ranked roles, but has made it worse because now you get people quick queuing support roles for fast games and refuse to support. 

Matchmaking is a joke, Overwatch is a joke, there is zero enforcement of the roles in ranked which totally defeats the point of the game mode and instead they are punishing and banning the people who are reacting to all this behaviour with Comms abuse which is another joke. I would rather play every single game with 4 other flamers than the players i get matched with day in, day out. at least flamers are actually trying to win a game.

And Fuck you Valve, once again i'm issued with an  Overwatch penalty for refusing to lane with cunt supports who will not play their fucking role, farm steal and kill steal, but its the fucking cores fault, for trying to get farm. FUCK YOU AND YOUR OVERWATCH BULLSHIT.

this is now, hands down, the worst gaming experience on Steam, which is such a shame, because it used to be amazing."

28801,"Dota 2 is a game that requires a lot of investment. It's not about money (there's nothing wrong with that), but about the time you're willing to sacrifice. Download the game and with a runaway for a couple of matches to learn and understand all the secrets of Dota 2 is impossible. At first, each bout of the format ""five on five"" seems terrible chaos of colorful effects, in which it is impossible to live longer than a couple of minutes.

This game is just a down hill spiral. First you think to yourself after watching a professional match ""maybe I can get some quality teammates"" , ""maybe if I queue up right now I can play a game where I don't have someone go 3/15 in my mid lane and turn the enemies into a raid boss"" , but by the time the queue pops, you've already remembered  the last time you told yourself that lie only now you have a false sense of determination which will slowly be whittled away by the below average IQ of the entire low-elo community match after match until you start to question if it's them or you who have the issues, at that point it's probably best to just retire to making sandwiches lest you risk a chat ban. That is until you have that all to familiar thought of winning."

28860,"The '3k and below' experience :

Drafting phase, someone is highlighting a hero you don't play, so you ignore their suggestion and pick something you fancy.

The game start and they instantly start criticizing your pick in the allies voice chat. In the adverse team, some fanboy is spamming a famous team voiceline in the /all chat. One pauses, cuz why going to the WC before the game when you can make 9 other people wait.

Around min 0, your carry tries to sneak their jungle bounty rune and dies.

Min 6, the enemy mid player already ganked two times while your mid doesn't seem to give a shit. Your carry is making yolo moves and dying instead of focusing on their farm. They type ' gg I'm afk ' and go jungling,

Min 10, the safelane tower is dead, you are fighting with your strong core around the hardlane while your carry is recovering in the jungle. Someone in your team is pinging 'we need wards' as they died out of position in the river mid.

Min 15, your team finally managed to take the enemy top tower, you've got to mute 2 of your teammates and 1 enemy player that were pausing each time they made a kill.

Min 20, you smoke to the enemy jungle to place some wards, hoping the vision will make your carry comfortable enough to cross the river and farm there. Despite your efforts your carry won't leave the triangle. Your mid and p3 are also jungling in your side of the map. The other support is trying to make solo moves and get killed 4v1. ""Space created"" says their chat wheel. On a positive note, the enemy team also doesn't seem to have any intention to cross the river.

Min 25, nothing new under the sun. Is it actually night time in the game and your carry get kill in a 5 heroes smoke. Finally someone crossed the river.

Min 30, everyone is late on their items timings, your p3 rushed a radiance but have no armor/magic res against the other team. You are 1/7/13 with a force staff, that's not so bad.

Min 35, a weird teamfight is taking place around the rosh pit, the enemy mid died and instantly buy-back to die again a few secs later.

Min 40, both team took a tier 2 tower, you are currently making a siege under their t3 but no one have the guts to go on the high ground. The enemy team is complaining about their carry being an asshole in the /all chat. Eventually a teamfight happens and someone wins, the 2 people in the other team buy back and so everyone tacitly agrees on a jungling truce.
You start being a bit annoyed by the game and your attention drops, in so you die two times in a row trying to ward the exact same spot. One of your teammates chose this moment to reveal being a Slavic boi and start to angrily flame you. Sadly you don't understand anything but a 'cyka' or a 'blyat' from time to time.

45mins, one of the two sides eventually wins the game, but tbh this team doesn't deserve victory much more than the other. The winners drop some 'ez mid' in the /all chat.

Results : on each side 1 people got reported and 3 muted each others. You are happy that this mess of a game is over, and click on the green 'find match' button, hoping for the next one to be more interesting."

28947,Do you want a boring ass game that will take your soul away one match at a time and is one of the most mocked games in history? You do? OK then go play league of legends. Dota 2 has been and always will be the greatest video game created.

28980,"Gameplay : Fun
Playerbase : Toxic
Graphics : Great
Addictiveness : Yes
Would I recommend : No


Here's an honest update

Nothing wrong with the game, it's really fun. The problem is the players. The toxicity is on a deadly level in every game. I've played many games and I've never seen such an unfriendly and salty community before. Don't play it unless you got friends to play with."

28983,Ok
28984,"i spent way too many hours in high school playing this instead of league of legends.

now as an adult, i don't play at all. in comparison to league of legends, the queue times are usually double or triple, and the system doesn't feel as quick if you've played LoL.

not saying u should play LoL, or even Dota 2. the era of mobas is over."

29308,"A long time ago, I started as a fresh bab to MOBAS in general and was introduced to Dota 2. I still play this with these friends, but I must note that there are far more entertaining games on the market. Heroes of the Storm, League of Legends, Smite, Battlerite, but none have the degree of polish and thought that is required to play a round of Dota. Dota is a game of perseverance, of learning, and of pain. After all this time, i'm by no means an expert, and with the massive roster at hand you can play for thousands of hours and still not reach the skill ceiling. Every character is unique, but has counter play. Not a single time has there been a moment where I called bs on a player pushing a button and blowing up my ancient. There were times I despaired, surely, but I knew that things could have gone differently in the draft phase, or the lane phase, or the team fight phase if the co-ordination and itemization of whichever side i'm on is performed adequately. Someone always invisible? Buy a dust to reveal him, or place a sentry. The enemy picked a backline bandit that can kill us all from a mile away? We should draft an engage or an assassin hero to eliminate his presence. The enemy likes to cast point and click stuns that disables for a millennia? I should buy a spell blocking item to save me from that CC! Every possible play can be negated, but it is up to you to understand and learn how each item/hero interacts to better perform. 

Quotes: ""Time and time again, i've seen the fight between Radiant and Dire go thousands of different directions, and thankfully, every time, win or loss, i've learned something new."" 

""After 700 hours I can say without a shadow of a doubt, that the soul and purpose of the game is to click on minions for 40 minutes and then you can finally be allowed to play.""

""People who play Dota 2 treat normals games like LCS and have egos that tower over mountains. No-one is playing to have fun, they're playing to win.""

Dota 2 is not a good game, but it is the best measure of how you can adapt and co-operate with random people you meet.
It is the best team on team action you can ever hope to participate in, and in an odd way it IS the best game Valve has ever made. 

I hate it. 

It isn't for the casual audience, and nor is it for the faint of will. It is a professional game that will beat you blue and bloody til you learn from your mistakes, and will make you not only hate the game, it will make you hate yourself. If you find yourself amongst friends who want to play it, go ahead. You will have plenty to enjoy, but you could much more easily find entertainment skipping stones on a pond, playing in the mud, or reading a book out loud. You could always have a blast as long as you are in good company. 

I'm putting down Dota 2 for a little while. I might come back, but it isn't for me. The people I find on this game are the most insufferable, and Dota doesn't provide wins to losses. It forces you into loss streaks somewhat divided by small victories that carve a piece of you away."

29342,"Probably one of the most entertaining / challenging games I've ever played. It has its occasional bugs and downtime, but overall is an aesthetic masterpiece with constant updates and tweaks.

Despite the hours, and my love for this game, I struggle to actually recommend it to friends based on the toxicity of the community alone.

Whilst I've made some great friends in the game, and enjoy partying with them, a large portion of the community have little-to-no interpersonal skills and like to abuse each other constantly.

After the release of the TV show recently, I had thought that perhaps it was on it's way to a resurgence with a flow in of new players, although it seems to have gotten worse. Having to mute 1-2 players in most games, why would any newcomer stay for such an experience?

Sadly without any serious consequences from Valve, I fear this game will eventually become an aged e-sports title, with it's only fans being those that centre around it's online tournaments.

EDIT: For those who still want to play but have issues with the above, disable chat from people who arent friends/party members. This still doesn't change my review, as I cannot recommend this to new players, as they need to amass a friends list before this offers any reprieve.

EDIT: Fuck."

Endless hours of trying to learn how to play the game, following the friendly advice of multiple youtubers, only to get destroyed by a techies meme build. The only comfort being the verbal abuse from your teammates, due to the lack of vision, which is clearly your fault.

29440,"If you want destroy your entire life and enjoy it? Start playing this game with its cancerous community (toxic teammates), a bunch of low skilled players including feeders, game runners, and baby-rages, it even gets better when you get addicted and start wasting few hundred bucks every year over some cosmetic stuff for the The International Battle Pass. Get yourself ready for some hair loss over anxiety and anger issues. But overall, despite all that I've said there is never going to be a game better than DOTA 2 and more complete in every aspect. Learn it and enjoy.

For the smurfs... I hate smurfs as they are a big disadvantage for the team‚Ä¶ Some players just keeps feeding, just because they don‚Äôt get the mid lane... Some ruiners buy wards and keep it in their backback and never want to plant them... when wrads restock they'll be the first to buy and after all, all the maps are blind and we're easily ganked. I‚Äôm truly tired of losing MMR and AP.
And another thing is that the matching is too long especially when we are in Low Priority pool.

The Anti-Defamation League has released a 2021 follow-up to its past studies on toxicity in online gaming, which tracks players‚Äô experiences in various prominent games. Studies on the subject began in 2019, with DOTA 2 being the worst-rated game in both the inaugural rating and the 2020 edition of the study.¬†

By all measures, DOTA 2 is more toxic than League of Legends by a significant margin.
Even though DOTA 2 isn‚Äôt the most toxic game anymore, it‚Äôs still statistically worse than a long list of competing titles. Only 65% of players from rival MOBA League of Legends reported harassment, compared with DOTA 2‚Äôs 78%.¬†
The ADL‚Äôs study also found DOTA 2 to be worse than most other top console and PC multiplayer titles, including PlayerUnknown‚Äôs Battlegrounds, Counter-Strike: Global Offensive, and Fortnite.

Toxicity in DOTA 2 has become normal due to a number of different factors, most of which boil down to inaction from Valve in addressing problems.
Starting at the very top of DOTA 2 is the normalcy of bad behavior among DOTA 2 pros. Many professional players regularly stream themselves intentionally feeding, griefing, and generally behaving poorly.¬†
Racist language is also unfortunately common among DOTA 2 pros. Popular personalities including Anathan ‚Äúana‚Äù Pham and Hector ‚ÄúK1‚Äù Rodriguez have spouted blatant racism in-game without consequence. This has spilled over into actual tournaments, with players using racist language against Chinese opponents in-game and facing no repercussions from Valve.

This applies to esports organizations and tournament organizers as well. Grant ‚ÄúGranDGranT‚Äù Harris had a history of aggression towards women both physically and verbally, but was still a regular commentator at tournaments and was sponsored by Evil Geniuses for years. Henrik ‚ÄúAdmiralBulldog‚Äù Ahnberg has had a number of controversies surrounding his use of racist language and stereotypes on stream, but remains a part of Alliance and has worked as an analyst at multiple events.
Compare this with League of Legends, which regularly sees pro players fined and suspended for using racist language, and it‚Äôs easy to see why these issues might escalate over time in DOTA 2.

But whatever this is still the best game ever."

29470,"Given that it started life as a faithful recreation of the original Defence of the Ancients mod, you‚Äôd be forgiven for thinking of Dota 2 as the archetypical MOBA. Yet this isn‚Äôt the case: in practice, Dota 2‚Äôs purism sets it apart from the vast majority of games in this genre. What we think of as the MOBA really began with Heroes of Newerth and League of Legends‚Äîgames that took that roughshod family of WarCraft custom maps and professionalised them, commercialised them, found them a form that would enshrine the MOBA at the top of the gaming world for the better part of a decade."

29474,"I have played this game for 3215 hours. I have 999 wins in unranked matchmaking. I have not played this game since probably around 2018, I was drinking quite a bit and if matches were going bad I'd often do shots instead of finishing matches. I was in low-priority when I uninstalled the game, my review of this game will entirely depend on whether I am still in low-prio when I have finished re-installing it. I remember having some valuable items in-game so I will probably sell those ASAP. I'd be surprised if I was still in Low-Priority, I mean they've changed the game so much since then and now, who's to say that their actions weren't what triggered my bad behavior that incurred the slap on the wrist to begin with, that would be pretty arrogant on their part to automatically absolve themselves of culpability. We'll just have to see. I can safely say I did not receive this product for free as I bought a treasure within the game and everyone knows vanilla loadouts are for losers. 

UPDATE: Reinstalled the game and I am no longer in low-prio. Glad the devs had the humility to admit they erred to discipline me for being un-entertained by their entertainment product."

29496,"It feels distinctly as if all the sane people quit playing this corpse of a game a long time ago, all that's left are a nucleus of die-hard fans, pros and total psychopaths, with little to no middle ground. 

Meta is currently staler than last century's cheese (2 months since last patch, which in turn changed a couple values to some abilities, wow!); close to zero communication from the developers regarding future patches and changes, not even a hint of them trying to engage with the community for feedbacks and propositions. 

Only thing that's keeping the game borderline 'alive' is the pro scene, but anything below tier 1 is treated like garbage and downright disrespected by the company. Oh, you wanted to play some competitive dota and you are not a tier 1 team? Too bad, we are canceling big tournaments for which you've already invested time and effort and money just to qualify. Sucks to be you!

The game fails to attract new blood with a new player experience that's not just bad, not even terrible, hellish is the only adjective that even comes close to describing it accurately. Amidst all this, what does the small indie company do? That's right folks, more hats and battle passes and cosmetics locked behind a couple hundred quids paywall, for whale buyers to gorge upon! Because the cow has to be milked dry right until the last breath.

Particulary interesting is the corelation between button smashing and teammplay contribution.

*Gameplay is deliciously demanding and easily kicks any other thoughts out of your mind for. Last hitting, positioning and item+heroe knowledge creates a steep learning curve, the more rewarding it feels to achieve progress, however small it might be.

*Such SOLID new player introduction courses. Lessons are kept short and focused, well explained and playing them provides a wonderful basic understanding to not annoy people ingame with total noobness.

*Makes you turn into a chameleon - one eye on your current position, the other flings into the corner for checking the map. A third one might grow during gameplay to channel your inner zen / troll when people turn arrogant.

*don't miss Pudge's hook.

29662,"As a new player, this is one of the worst communities ever. I've asked for help in every single game I've played in, and not ONCE received a reply from my teammates. How am I supposed to get better at the game if the people I'm playing with won't help? 

The game itself is great - nice visuals, a huge roster of characters to choose from, 'simple' mechanics (although I'm still getting used to the massive item/upgrade list), but it's ruined by a massive learning curve and a community that just doesn't seem to care about new players. 

Such a shame.

EDIT: OK, so it appears that for some reason the default chat settings are set to 'friends only', which is why I wasn't getting any replies. I changed that and now I can hear everyone calling me a f****t, human garbage, trash, etc. At least we're talking now, I guess...?"

29681,"Dota 2 is a real-time strategy computer multiplayer team game with elements of a computer role-playing game, the implementation of the famous DotA map for Warcraft III in a separate client.

The game is played by two teams of five people. One team is on the light side, the other is on the dark side. Each player controls one hero, each of which has special skills and abilities. The hero can gain experience to increase his level, earn gold, buy and collect items that strengthen him or give him additional abilities. Each player constantly receives a small amount of gold from their base, and also earns small portions of gold for killing enemy creatures and large portions for killing heroes. Teams are dispersed along the lines, where they fight against enemy heroes and units of creeps under the control of the computer, which appear at the bases of the teams every half a minute. The goal of the game is to destroy the main building in the enemy base."
