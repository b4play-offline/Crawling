3,"this is one of those games where it gets left in the dust because the sequel was better. but that's not to say its bad,
I still have fun with this game. It has a unique atmosphere and wonderful soundtrack.

10/10!"
4,Classic game. Awesome story. What more do I need to say besides the cake is a lie.

I've been playing on my Steam Deck."
12,It is great an smart game full of cool characters and puzzles. Remember the cake is an lie?

27,"Portal is such a great puzzle solving game with an extremely interesting story, which leaves you wanting to know more about the setting and characters and the connections between them. GLaDOS's voice actress, Ellen McLain, delivered such a strong and emotional performance for a robotic monotone character and her voice is absolutely beautiful in regards to singing. I highly recommend buying this."
28,"fun, ahead of its time"
29,No portal 3 :(
30,"Incredible game, even with no experience with the franchise! The game is fun, entertaining, and best of all funny. I highly recommend this game."
31,"nice
"
32,"this game is great, for those of you who have not played it, it is a puzzle game and you have to figure your way out of every room of the facility. it is a great game that i have beaten so many times on my consoles, and i love it so much i had to get it for pc and do it again. i plan to keep beating it over and over in time. i play and beat it, wait a few months to forget all the puzzles and then play it again."
33,"Very over-hyped!
Zero storyline, easy puzzles, and only 2 hours of play time. The final boss was fun though!"
34,"This game is amazing. From the dialogue, the main villain, to everything in-between. If you haven't played this or Portal 2, do that now or Cave Johnson will make a combustible lemon that burns your house down."
35,"This game is a foundation for a masterpiece!
Portal 2 is a masterpiece and Portal 1 is the foundation of it!"

100,"Walk to the end of the hallway. Turn around and fire a portal on the third panel above the hallway.
Go back in the hall and the shoot a portal on the floor at the end of the hallway. Drop down through the portal.
You should automatically drop through for the second time and then land on the other side of the Goo.
Turn right and place a portal on the ceiling. Put the other portal on the wall above the goo and jump through it.
Turn to face the platform above. Shoot a portal on the ceiling above it and the other one under yourself.
Turn towards the door. Fire a portal on the same wall and put the other one near yourself and go through.
Place a portal on the extended wallpanels near the ceiling. Shoot the other one on a platform below and jump through it.
Walk to the switch and push it. Crouch and get to the second part of the chamber. Go to the left.
Follow the aiming beam of the turret on the platform near you. Shoot a portal on the wall where the beam ends and the other one where the High Energy Pellet emitter is going to shoot next. Wait for the Pellet to knock the turret over.
Do the same again for the turret aiming at the same wall and to the turret near you.
At the back of the chamber there are extended walls facing the last turret. Put a portal there and the other one where the emitter is going to shoot next.
You should have deactivated all of the four turrets. Go stand next to the switch and fire a portal on the extended walls on the other side of the chamber.
Shoot a portal on the wall where the emitter is about to fire the next Pellet and wait for the Pellet to go through the portal.
Quickly fire a portal on the wallpanels facing the switch and the other one on the wall near you. Enter through the portal and press the switch.
Wait for the Pellet to reach the catcher and walk to the Unstationary Scaffold.
Get on the platform and wait for it to stop at the other end. Then drop down behind the switch.
Shoot a portal above the glass on the other side and the other one on the wall next to you.
Push the switch and go through the portal. When the panels are in the correct angle, put a portal on the panels and then turn left and go to the ledge.
Shoot the other portal on the floor below and drop down through the portal.
Pick up the cube and wait for the Unstationary Scaffold to get near you. Then jump on the platform with the cube.
Place the cube in front of the glass and place a portal above the glass. Turn around and go on the platform.
Jump behind the switch again and put a portal on the wall.
Push the switch and go through the portal. Pick up the cube and walk over to the first part of the chamber.
Place the cube on the button and fire a portal on the wall with the open door.
Drop down on one of the platforms and fire a portal on the floor. Go through the portal.
Go through the open door behind you and walk to the other end of the corridor and drop down.
Shoot a portal on the platform further away. Turn to the left and fire the other portal on the floor there and drop down.
When you have gone through the portal and are about to fall down again, place a portal on the platform beside you and go through the portal again.
Do this two more times. You should then see angled panels somewhere. Shoot the portal there and you will reach the elevator.
Alternative Solutions
Instead of activating the scaffold by directing the pellet into the catcher, you can simply fling yourself over to the cube if you're fast. When you step out into the room after deactivating all the turrets, immediately turn around and shoot a portal on the slanted platform, then jump down the ledge and shoot the other portal under you. You will fly and land in the room with the cube. At this point, the scaffold will activate without using the pellet at all.

A glitched way to complete the test is to retrieve the camera from the turret room and place it against the door, bypassing the need to get the cube as the camera holds the door open"

175,"[b] science [/b]

my closest friend killed themself, it tore me in half. The most logical religion we adhere to being science, I beam my head in it’s direction searching for any semblance of assurance. but it just coldly looks back at me and simply states that they are dead, decomposing, rotting. 

[b] cake [/b] 

thankfully science has been willed towards the infinite torture to all prey. thankfully we have more food than anyone should ever be able to eat, thankfully our grocery stores are sterile, thankfully i walk around outside and not a single person would ever think of talking to me. I eat dinner alone i eat dinner alone and cry into my soup, my bread was processed in a factory and for longevity is infused with random oils.

[b] aperture [/b] 

Thankfully i stare into the gaping maw of unending blight, but the berries my brain perceives that are the degenerations of my computer screen keep me compliant and submissive. We are all glad we can stare at virtual berries and herbs that never have existed. Our brains are numb and our mouths are sewn shut. we think without thinking and exist without feeling. we roam our pavement roads and fall into random holes spinning endlessly with a straight face.
we are in a labyrinth of a science lab

[b] Portal [/b] 

What a funny thing, we will pray to science for the novelty of a portal gun. 
What of human experience? 
I gaze into mirrors and I only recognize tears. 

[b] Still Alive [/b] 

the dead are dead and we are alive, heaven or hell don’t exist. yet i move fforward somehow. im  still alive. I’ve chosen to live many times, many times i’ve made the choice of life, many have failed many have tripped many will trip and many will fail but im alive. i love being alive and i fear death i wish i could live forever, i want everyone to be poisoned and blessed by my existence.    
 i wish my years on this earth werent full of turmoil and rape i wish to live i want to live. i face the tempting allure of suicide and death, hopping into the pile of endless bodies   but   still...

I choose life



"
176,Not that fun but you should play it before Portal 2. Portal is much better.
177,"You probably already know what this game is about and you get what you see, it is a very basic game with few mechanics but the portal systems are very cool. It is very short though and has very little replayability (save maybe trying to get achievements). I personally would not say that it is worth it at full price and just wait for a sale and then you can get it really cheap."
178,"A masterclass in how to do environmental storytelling. The puzzles are great fun, and feels great to play through, and the game does not shove explanations down your throat."
179,"Best puzzle game period.
There's so much character and uniqueness to this game its truely a one of a kind. Its a puzzle game that can be quire obvious and simple and yet you still feel like a genius for beating it.

Btw don't go for the gold medals they'll break your soul.
"
180,"This game has the most odd Valve game to be made. For how short it is and how the team behind it was a strange studio. I normal play this game when i get that valve ich. For this game is a short, starter and a grated for the orange box. 
8/10"
181,One of the GOAT
182,put a portal above and below you and the fun begins
183,"Compared to Portal 2's solo campaign this is short, but it's still a really good game. I recommend both. The levels are fun and interesting. The turrets are goofy when you kill disable them and there are some nice little details/secrets in the game. The challenge levels can be difficult, but once you get the hang of them completing them is satisfying. Buy it."
184,Kid named finger:
185,best game ever
186,I like when the robots go brbrbrbrbrbrrrr
