0,"This game is meant to be played with friends. I don't think it would be that fun playing solo, as you need to grind a lot of items to build and expand the raft. The graphics are not something mind-blowing, the game has a unique art-style. The story is cool enough and characters too. The performance is not that good, even on a high end PC, I am still getting drops (really hard drops). So overall if you have a friend who wants to play this game with you, then buy it; if you don't then I suggest you hold onto your money (just because of the performance)."

48,"I have been married for about 30 years and never really gamed with my wife.   She was too intimidated to play 3D games because she could never get past the awkward walking into walls or looking up at the ceiling that are typical of new gamers.  She would always quit in frustration (my laughing probably didn't help either).

I bought two copies of this game to finally remedy that situation.  She wasn't interested in shooting/killing games so this seemed the perfect choice.   Cute, friendly graphic style that probably help relax her fears.

We played the game on easy and we both have been having a blast.    We have reached 103 hours of gameplay together on Raft in a single save game.   We didn't want the game to end so badly that we have kept going to try to get as many achievements as possible.

My only minor complaint with the game is that we discovered some of the tech very late in the game.   I wish they had changed the order slightly so that you get time to use it all before the story mode ends.   Of course some DLC would help with this problem (wink at the developers, lol).

I want to thank Redbeet Interactive and Axolot Games for helping finally bring my wife into 3D gaming. Those 100+ hours you gave us together mean the world to us."

76,"All this game needed was some user testing performed by casual gamers. Nothing about this game is intuitive. There is no tutorial, and the normal mode is surprisingly punitive to a new player. The game controls are like giving commands to a person who has no thoughts of their own. After fighting tooth and nail with this game to figure out how to make water and not die of dehydration, my boat got stuck on some rocks, and I couldn't get it out with the paddle. It was the final nail in the coffin. I don't recommend."

89,"I love games like Stardew Valley, Forager, and The Sims 4 so pretty chill crafting games.  I see this game as a pretty chill crafting game but focusing on the vastness of the ocean.  It's for some, not for others.  In the meantime, I'm enjoying collecting planks and exploring islands."
90,"No. Why do I say this? It's tedious. Oh so hard and tedious. Even playing on easy doesn't make you feel better. Playing on peaceful makes you feel even worse. Not to mention the game takes SOOO LOOOONG. Progression is extremely slow. You have to research every bit of material, take extremely long to gather materials for most of the stuff in the game, WHILE you are being attacked by the shark most of the time. Unless you are on a small island with no threats, you are never safe. Collecting stuff underwater isn't even fun, including the fact EVERYTHING good early game lies there. Note that you have basically no equipment to get any of it, making peaceful really viable, and maybe easy. But as mentioned before, you don't feel good about it. Enemies still attack you if you attack them.

Now onto building your raft. Building in this game would be good, if it weren't for the fact you are extremely limited in your building choices, but also because you always run out of resources to build with, and have to spend another few hours just to get a small percentage of progress done. You are forced to progress in building your raft as you go, but it's just not fun. You should probably just make the bare minimum, and create your raft after you complete the story. 

The story parts and the varying islands are fine, I actually kinda like them.

This game REALLY sucks with combat. It's just utter bull. All of the time, on large islands, some of the most important ones (not story related,) there's always a warthog, a bird, and some small passive animals. For the warthog, I hate this damned thing. It has an unavoidable charge attack, and takes away a large chunk of your health when it hits you. It's annoying to kill, considering the first time you encounter it you would normally just have a wooden spear. That thing doesn't do shit. On some islands, the warthog is blocking important paths to the loot/trading post, or even both. It's extremely annoying to deal with it. The bird is easy to ignore. Just step away from the rock it tries to drop on you. The passive creatures are annoying to kill, which makes something like a bow useful, instead of the standard spear. I guess you could apply this to all creatures.

For the trading post, I think this is actually a pretty good feature. You have to start the story to use these, though. It would be great if it wasn't so painful to get to that point. You need all the stuff from the trading post early game, but by the time you can actually buy from the post, you don't need the stuff. Maybe just standard planks and plastic. Endgame rewards aren't even that great and doesn't make you FEEL rewarding. It's just giving you nothing to do, no replay value, and if you felt like it, you can basically only just make a better raft.

One thing I really liked was the food system. It is well made, no need to comment any more on that. 

Multiplayer makes the game half as time consuming and painful. If you have friends, this game becomes a lot more fun, basically lowering the grinding amounts into small bits per player. Story is fun to experience with another. One thing to warn: if you have no friends to play this with, or even talk with about it, it's not gonna be much fun. I can say this from my perspective. I have practically no friends who own this game to talk about with. 

Within 2 hours of the game, I was contemplating refunding it. First impressions were okay, not good. It just got worse as I eventually dumped 8 more hours into it. If you liked this game and thought it was worth the money, good for you. I didn't. I don't believe it is worth 20 dollars. Spend your money on something good like Subnautica when a sale rolls around, or on a 3rd party website.




Overall opinion (tl;dr): This game is MAYBE really only fun in multiplayer. Has some good features, but they don't make up for the terrible ones. 5/10, would not buy.

106,used to love watching this game on youtuber when i was younger
107,"I`m a 47 years old freelancer and this game saved my life!
I born like a handicapped boy and I have problem with my legs. I was ""nailed"" to the chair basically entire my life.
Even when in my childhood I never had any friends cause of that. There`s was literally nothing I can do... I just wanted to be like an ordinary kid just running and playing some football. I hated this life. Nobody was understanding me except my family. Only thing I found really entertaining it was watching my brother plays. He noticed that and we started to sharing one old PC. It was really fun! We talked a lot of some games topics and he teach me basically everything I need to know. But after some time, my older brother have to move from our family to another town, because of his college and he gave me his old PC. PC gave me chance to forget everything I have experienced in my life. Time passed and I started to playing my life changing game, Raft. There I met my dear friends and my wife. They accepted me the way I was. Right now I have a family and my son. We still playing games sometimes and I hope this will stay as it is. Never lose your hope in the best!"

115,REALLY GOOD GAME!
116,I would absolutely recommend this game to anyone. It was the first game I ever played on PC and it was a blast. I really enjoyed the gameplay and how customizable everything was. I just wish more would be added into it.
117,"I really have been enjoying this game. I am also glad that it has different modes of challenge so that you can either be creative, or adjust to the dynamics before leveling up to harder modes. However, it does get a little repetitive after a while when playing solo after you have all of your survival tools. I play in one to three day time blocks then have to take a break. There is a story, however can't speak for that yet because I have not got that far into the game. 3 hours, and I just have the basics down pat enough to feel confident to make a run towards completing the story. I can see the fun in this game as multi-player however as well."
118,I play games on easy and enjoy the story. This game is one of the best for those who want to enjoy a chill game with or without friends.
119,Good
120,a fun chillaxed (unless the shark gets ya) survival game ;D
121,haha frank

123,"probably the worst survival game out there ...
gameplay is just looping between gathering materials from land and ocean then sailing to some where and waste all the food you saved up in the process because when you don't see garbage piles there is nothing to do.
you pick garbage floating on the ocean , looking for rock , ore , trees on land
it became extremely tedious after a while , I was playing with a friend so I was able to tolerate this game just a little longer .

 if you know what you are doing shark is easy to kill without take any damage , shark meat became your major food source . 
Items have very low durability , your character gets hungry/thristy extremely fast on higher difficulty , its almost feel like you are playing as a fat person trying to eat buffet on that raft when you don't ,you die .

some of the item design are pretty bad for example the hook does not require a rope to make but clearly it has a rope in it , while a fishing rod require like 8 ropes. and the anchor is game after one use but clearly it should be a retrievable.

game is playable with very little content to offer when you compare it with the forest, minecraft, green hell. 

just stay away from this one."
124,"Good idea for the game, game mechanism is okay but execution is lacking. Annoying bugs from not being able to collect materials on the floor on land to raft constantly getting stuck here n there. The feedback from an attack is close to none. I'd say 6/10 needs some work. Maybe it'd get more refined in the future. hopefully."

145,"A good (but not great) unique take on survival games. The concept of being stranded on a raft, fishing for loot, and managing your character are all very well executed. Building is fun also, and nothing seems too repetitive. I played this game for maybe a week straight and it seems like there isn't anything worth coming back to in this game at all to be all that honest. I don't see much replayability in restarting a raft because I don't believe that the islands or encounters can vary THAT MUCH. Overall, worth the price on any sale, as long as you have 2+ people."

159,"yes, very good yes"
160,"The puzzles were the worst part of the game and you have to deal with them at every story point in order to progress. You only get one tool upgrade (plastic to scrap) and the endgame tool upgrade is useless because you beat the game already and there’s no reason to keep playing after that. 

I had fun but the puzzles ruined the game for me. If you like puzzles then you’ll probably like this. The survival aspect is fun and challenging at times and the raft building/customization is a highlight. It’s hard to give this game a solid recommendation but I think most people that like survival games will get their money’s worth out of this game."
161,"The graphics are good and the idea is great! It is an arcadey survivor game which does not take into account all elements of typical survival, only water, food and world dangers. Would be more fun if you had to make shelter, escape heat/cold etc. The game was fun for a while, but then you realise that the game is on an infinite loop with a small number of unique island reappearing over and over again. The more you mine, the more unique things you seem to find in the world, and it was fun to build the raft! but the breaking thing for me was that on some islands you would find unmanned trading stations (like wtf, where did they come from?) and there you can trade with the computer I guess? But this broke the last element of survival for me..."

173,Game was fun at start but got very frustrating later on
174,"start good, end bad"
175,"Initally I loved Raft. The initial gameplay loop was fun and upgrading my raft was satisfying. However, the longer it went on the less I liked it. There seems to be no actual official tutorial or help, you are expected to go to a Wiki or work out how to use things by trial and error. Would it really have killed the developers to actually write a proper tutorial? Also, the upgraded components that you spend so much time trying to get seem to make little difference and/or wear out ridiculously quickly. I'm not sure if the leather armour, for example, makes any difference at all. Sharks and warthogs seem to do the same amount of damage whether I'm wearing it or not. 

Those were not my biggest problems however. The framerate, for me, has now made the game completely unplayable. My pc is not great but neither is it terrible. I initially turned down most of the settings and managed to get a framerate I was happy with and it was fine as I upgraded my raft, added a 2nd floor and built the radio receiver. However, things took a turn for the worse when I was able to craft ammo for the net catcher and grab a few animals. Great, I thought, I can get wool, eggs and milk and craft new stuff. I established a small animal enclosure with 2 llamas, 1 chicken and 1 goat. I don't think that's exactly excessive. The game seems to disagree however as I am now getting an average of about 5 frames a second with it sometimes dropping to 2! This problem seems to persist whether or not I am on my raft or even in visual sight of it. I cannot imagine the sort of (lack of) optimization that can cause so severe a problem. It's a real shame because the game was so enjoyable at first but the framerate means it is now completely unplayable for me. I suppose I could get rid of my animals and see if it then becomes playable but I refuse to jump through hoops to try and play a game so badly coded. If you have a ninja pc then it I guess it may be ok for you."

201,"It took 60 hours to go through all the episodes, and in general it was fun and could be innovative without too many limitations. But there are some small bugs, as well as can add some expansion of play, such as how to effectively defend against a certain animal attack, to charge some things to use repeatedly. Looking forward to the development of new episodes, or raft 2, I think I will buy again to play! The premise is that there is enough innovation and progress."

252,"I am a 45 yo father, probably one of the oldest people playing this game. I am a single farther to my Son, who is 14 now. My son got this game for Christmas in 2021 from his uncle, so we installed it on his computer and he started playing. By the end of the week he had 24 hours on this game. This was horrible for me, as it was already hard for me to find ways to spend time with my son, as he is always out with his friends or just watching YouTube. So I decided to make a Steam account and get this game to see if I could maybe play alongside him. I loaded into the game, picked my character and started playing but I was stuck on what you where supposed to do. I asked my Son for help and he hosted a game for me to join. I loved it as it was the best time I had spent with my Son since my wife had died. This game has ever since brought me and my son closer again and now we actually spend time together outside the house together as well. This game reminded me that there's fun to be had in everything, and it has brought both me and my Son many happy memories."

259,"Things that need improving for this game to cater to newcomers:

- Larger inventory to begin with.
- More food / drink options when not near islands to begin with.
- Improved inventory management. Right-click food to eat should be possible, also when it's not in the quickbar. This goes for ALL items that, for some silly reason, has to be moved to the quickbar and then selected there to be used. It feels very cumbersome and there are way better ways to do this that I would consider standard.
- When you construct an item that needs placement, it's probably because you want to place it. Make it so!
- Close proximity construction inventory!
- Add keyboard numbers to the quickbar (why aren't they there?).
- In stores, make it clear what you can, and can't afford currently. Right now you have to click each item to find out if you can afford it.
- Same goes for the item construction menu. Make stuff grey when you can't afford it currently.
- When there's no room for an item in your inventory, let the player know! Right now it simply drops on the ground behind you if you're moving forward. So you can be running around collecting stuff. And then after a while you'll look behind you and see the trail of stuff you thought you picked up.
- When you're perched, play the sound of being thirsty once every 30 seconds... Not all the time, please. It's very distracting, especially when you're frantically trying to find something to drink.

Game looks good and plays pretty well. But these things bog it down tremendously for new players such as myself. I keep putting it away due to it simply being bogged down by design problems.

It's a shame for an otherwise pretty cool survival game."

261,"the game is fun, until it isnt. ending is very anticlimactic and very little replayability."
262,"If you haven't made it farther than the raft building part, then you ain't played raft. the story is fun traveling to each location not knowing whats gonna happen next. The Raft expanding is fun because you and your friends build something unique that you know no-one has built like it before. We've had a blast playing and its $20. Most games these days are Ass with a $40 price tag. This game is a gem and i really enjoyed it so far. Give it a go but don't play alone as the game is very grindy, you'll need friends to play with to keep the grind down.
Edit:Just finished the Story and i'm disappointed that it's over, however it was a fun adventure i recommend taking your time to play through the story so it lasts longer. plus there are plenty of achievements to get to prolong game-play as well."

274,"Vagamos por el mar en busca del tan aclamado Raft, recorrimos los rincones más peligrosos y también las islas más bonitas de todo el océano. Nos enfrentamos a periodos de hambruna, sequía, arriesgamos la vida en batallas con criaturas que si no las viera uno mismo dudaría de su existencia. Desvelamos secretos del estado, y establecimos una nueva sociedad. Sin embargo, nunca encontramos el Raft.

No existe tal cosa como ""El Raft"", con mis camaradas dedicamos la vida en su búsqueda pero nos dimos cuenta que la respuesta estaba frente a nuestras narices. El Raft, es la unión y amistad de marineros...

Atte: Un naufrago errante."
275,"*** Could have been a Classic ***

I can see why a lot of people enjoy this game. It's a great idea. It's just that the balance feels very off to me. I would be playing more if it wasn't such a grind. Don't get me wrong, though. I don't usually mind grindy games. In fact, they are my favorite types of games. I'm getting frustratingly bored doing the same stuff over and over again.

Here's an example. I build the first wooden spear. It's easy to build, but it's use is rather short lived. It takes 2 of them to stab the shark to death. Eventually, I get the next spear. It requires a bit of iron, and is about twice as deadly as the first spear. The thing is, it only lasts around 2 to 3 times as long. This mechanic is present among most of the equipment. This seems ok at first, but starts to irritate you after a while. It's not as easy to get iron, which really requires you to burn through a few spears to kill the shark just to get the iron you need again. In other words, it take you a lot longer than what you would think to try to get ahead of the curve.

This was even worse for me with the flippers. When I first got flippers, I was thought I was now playing in style. Then I realized the flippers had durability. They also take quite a bit of materials to make. The flippers did not last very long at all. I felt like I wasn't properly rewarded for my time. I'm not even sure why they wore out so fast. Do they melt in the water or something odd? I really don't know.

Look. I get it. There's supposed to be some sort of challenge to a survival game. I play many of them. But there is a difference between challenge and just being tedious. This game is more tedious than challenging.

My next venture was growing my own food. It seemed like at least his would be worth my time. I planted some melons and they grew at a decent pace. Then the seagulls came. They eat your stuff faster than you can blink. So I did the logical thing, and built a scarecrow. Victory was mine. So I thought, anyways. The Scarecrow kept the seagulls away as planned, but the annoying birds destroyed my scarecrow way faster than expected. I was totally disappointed.

The shark eats your raft. The birds eats your plants. Your stuff breaks way too quickly. Your food and water bars drop way to fast. This makes the game more frustrating than fun. You seriously have to babysit everything.

To simplify everything I just said, the game just doesn't respect your time. Progression needs to feel like progression. It shouldn't feel like tedium replaced by more tedium. Watching paint dry isn't a challenge. It's just watching paint dry."

290,This game is very entertaining with amazing plot and game play! Would 100% recommend!!!!
291,"Not realistic. Amazingly addictive. The beautiful environment and sometimes chunky mechanics has its own charm and although the last location has more walking around than I would like, the entire gameplay experience is well thought out. Raft manages to provide a refreshing gameplay experience with familiar gameplay mechanics. The story line could be more exciting and have a more coherent narrative but Raft has carved its own niche in an overloaded gameplay category. Playing on hard mode is a bit ridiculous with the amount of sharks imo Raft should apply their shark respawning mechanics IRL so sharks would no longer be an endangered species."

322,"its good hahahahahahahahaahh
"
323,"Raft is one of my favorite games. I like to play in peaceful mode for a relaxing time. Collect, build, advance.

As a survival game, Raft strikes a reasonable balance between survival chores and fun. It's fun to figure out a sustainable path forward. That eventually gets tedious, then the next story location unlocks better technology to alleviate that. The game doesn't let you achieve full automation, but eventually the survival chores become somewhat infrequent.

If anything makes the game lean toward the tedious side, it's probably the game's inventory system. Things like having to move items from your backpack to action bar, then select it as the active item, just to put the item in a device. Even when it might be the only place that item can go. Fairly obvious things are also missing. Like a sort button, grouping stacks of the same items together, pickups fill the action bar first then have to be moved to backpack by hand, sub-item crafting tedium. And generally the game recipes outsizing storage density, requiring lots of containers with similarly tedious management.

There are some other rough edges. Edges, for example, are very easy to fall from. There appears to be no grace area or hint of being close. The edge also seems inconsistent based on the rotation and position of the object, so it's hard to develop a feel for it. I fall off the raft and other objects somewhat frequently, but I don't in other games. Progression is also stretched out too far. Several blueprints are found in the last area of the game. One after the story is all but finished. Also, a crafting material required for the last tier items is found in undersized quantities compared to recipe needs. So you are blocked from some of the most useful items in the game until the game is already over.

Much of this is acceptable from a reasonably-priced game and an initial release from a new indie studio. But I recently discovered something that was unacceptable. I was in a situation where my internet was out, and I put Steam in offline mode to not use hotspot data. Periodically, the game would pop up an error and open a game menu. Ok, minor inconvenience, click Ignore and keep playing. Then I encountered a bug. When I had a container or inventory open or was carrying something, the game would no longer take my inputs. I had to kill the game each time, losing progress. I reported the bug and tried to work around it. But then I ran into the worst part, which is not a bug. Being offline blocked me from progressing the story, because some game objects could not be interacted with. When I questioned support about this, they said I had to be online to play. (So it didn't sound like that bug would be fixed.) Then they pled ignorance as to why it was designed this way.

Especially in No One Can Join mode, there is no functional reason to be online, nor to block game progress. So I started investigating the Why. The game's Privacy Policy makes the reason pretty obvious: collecting your data. Among the ways they use your data, many of them are to weaponize your data against you for profit, aka marketing use. The policy also ensures Redbeet can collect your data by blocking access to the game you paid for, unless you make an account, provide personal info, and stay online. If you exercise your right to object or stop the data collection under the GDPR, Redbeet will revoke your license to use the game that you paid for.

[i]Support told me I could disable data collection in Settings. I recall this being a checkbox option at some point during Early Access, but it no longer appears to be. Now when I click the Open Data Privacy Page button as suggested by support, nothing happens. If I were a gambler, I'd bet this button simply opens their privacy policy, which enumerates all the ways users are blocked from having a choice in the matter.[/i]

Because of this hostile ""privacy"" policy, I cannot recommend this game nor this studio."

341,THE GAME
342,"this game is really good because i named a chicken s and then my raft got stuck on an island and then the waves launched it away. but in all seriousness this game is real good
"
343,"Raft is a very chill but not to chill game, gud
"
344,good game
345,Needs more raft.
346,"TL;DR-The game annoyed the hell out of me quite a bit, but it was still pretty fun building your own OP wave rider.

The first few hours of this game are kinda rough. If you run out of a certain kind of material, you can find yourself stuck. If you don't build water purification and find food, you can find yourself starving or dying of thirst. That challenge drove me to continue. That challenge evaporates after a while. You'll have a farm, and more food and water then you can shake a stick at. Your material will just attach itself to your raft, or you'll spend hours fishing and recycling to get more. 

The platforming is laughable, not because it's easy, but because the challenge is in making the hit-boxes cooperate. The game forces platforming and isn't polished enough for it. 

The combat is a joke. I found myself easily able to just craft a couple bows and a load of arrows  and win every fight by shift+circle strafing. The hardest fight was the final boss, but not even because it's hard, more because it leaves puddles on the floor making it hard to move around without taking damage. 

The AI was a bad choice. It makes combat necessary because it will chase you forever. At one point I ran past a bear because I was tired of fighting them, and it ran after me through a pool of acid (or radioactive water or something) till I turned around and took no damage fighting it. The lurkers re-spawn too frequently, I got super annoyed by them. 

It feels like food and water run out way too fast. in real life you can go two weeks without food and a week without water. In this game if you go for a day without either your movement will slow to a crawl for the last 10 mins before you die and lose 66% of your inventory. 

All that being said, building and designing your own wave rider is pretty fun. Especially because it doesn't directly upgrade, you have to design it from the ground up each time you upgrade, or plan out your build in advance. And you can build a floating city or a tightly fit utility tower. Avoiding the shark is nearly impossible, but there are ways around it. If only every hostile in the game was designed like that. The unlocks come naturally and the progression comes right when you wish you had more of something, as long as you're following the story and get a couple upgrades off the trading posts."

407,"A fascinating idea, but for me it ultimately just doesn't work.  It's like any other open world crafting game but due to the nature of floating along one direction on a raft, you don't have any control over what resources you're getting to build with and it strips the open world out of the open world genre.  If you're looking for survival crafting + lots and lots of chill, you will probably like the game, you float along, you build what you will with the resources you're given, and you explore the locations you float to, but if you're looking for something with a open world survival game play loop you're not going to find it here."

434,pretty rad and is addicting. Would recommend playing with friends tho

436,Awesome game! Advised to play with friends
437,"Great game, really tickles my fancy. If you like any of the crafting, survival, building genres, highly recommend you try out Raft. It's also got a healthy amount of navigation, sailing, and farming aspects, which only adds to the fun in my opinion."
438,I hate Bruce
439,"Enjoyed it quite a lot as a co-operative story experience. Played the whole thing with my S.O. and we both liked it. While it has some major issues and general roughness around the edges, it still proves to be very fun.

Steadily improving the raft and exploring uninhabited islands makes up the core of the game and it is excellent. Even without the story it's quite fun just to sail around and look for materials to spruce up your raft. Once I had enough components I to safely call it a boat, the sailing mechanics are quite fun for anyone who enjoys messing about on open waters. 

The weak parts of the game include the writing, combat and building issues.
[list]
[*] Writing and dialogue was frankly both uninteresting and kind of silly (not in a good way). Some of the characters were okay but the voice acting didn't help.
[*] Combat was... okay, at best. Certainly it was never intended to be a very deep combat system but getting into fights felt tedious to annoying most of the time. I can safely say that fighting Screechers is one of the worst experiences the game gives you. You can do it safely once you know how, but it doesn't become any more fun.
[*] While I actually really love the building aspect of Raft, the issues it comes with are very undesirable. The game doesn't tell you what is blocking something you're trying to place so you have to remove everything until large objects fit, sometimes deletes items instead of dropping them when a supporting structure is broken, doesn't keep paint jobs when you remove an object meaning you have to paint things again everytime you move it, has various objects that feel like they weren't designed with the standard size/height of the raft components resulting in object clipping, piping is grid-snapped and looks bad no matter what you do, and various other niggling things that are annoying in combination.
[*] Also had some rare syncing issues and such, resulting in things like the raft being entirely under water or rubber banding.

442,"I am a 53 yo father, probably one of the oldest people playing this game. I am a single farther to my Son, who is 14 now. My son got this game for Christmas in 2021 from his uncle, so we installed it on his computer and he started playing. By the end of the week he had 24 hours on this game. This was horrible for me, as it was already hard for me to find ways to spend time with my son, as he is always out with his friends or just watching YouTube. So I decided to make a Steam account and get this game to see if I could maybe play alongside him. I loaded into the game, picked my character and started playing but I was stuck on what you where supposed to do. I asked my Son for help and he hosted a game for me to join. I loved it as it was the best time I had spent with my Son since my wife had died. This game has ever since brought me and my son closer again and now we actually spend time together outside the house together as well. This game reminded me that there's fun to be had in everything, and it has brought both me and my Son many happy memories."

453,"Raft is an survival crafting game that is a ton of fun.  The survival mechanics are relatively straightforward, there is a story (and it's pretty interesting), but I personally think the coolest part of the game is the crafting.  You're given a lot of flexibility, and you can make some pretty amazing things with the tools you're given.  

I got this game shortly after it came out, and I've played through it several times before it was even finished.  I'd highly recommend it!"

465,"To begin, i played with a group of 4 on multiplayer, normal mode.
The first 20 hours of the journey was actually enjoyable. getting food was difficult, shark attacked a ton and you scrapped to get by.
The second 20 hours the game gets really boring. most players would think the game scales difficulty with progression... well not this game. once you get ahead in resources and make a decent raft that is shark proof, has a bunch of nets, and is automated, has farms, power, etc... well theres nothing to do at this point except complete the story... well thats the issue.
The story is garbage! idk why people think its a good one, because the ending is complete trash filled with obstacle courses. a ton of it is too easy with no mob scaling. to be honest, the underwater boss is more difficult and fun than the end.
Most of all, you feel like you wasted time. when you spend hours and hours on farming because you think you are going on an epic adventure that will actually require resources, just to find out that you dont need to do that at all!

5/10 - Good start, Terrible end."
466,SHARKS.
467,"Steam really needs to implement a ""Mixed"" option on if one would recommend the game. Because when it comes to Raft, Mixed is definitely where I lie.

Early Access (chapters 1 & 2) would have originally put this at a ""Yes"". The gameplay loop was rather straightforward - maintain food/water and gather supplies/advance tech while not getting eaten by the persistent shark that's floating around your raft. There was just enough in that early-mid part of the game where you were spinning plates before you were able to stabilize. There were places to go along the way that pushed forward a narrative (whoopsie humanity had some global warming and f---ed it all up!) while giving you new tools to advance to the next area. Combat wasn't necessarily the game's strong point, but it also was not a hard requirement to continue. The first boss that was introduced had a mechanic that allowed you to bypass the fight as long as you explored the island and figured it out. Death definitely felt a bit on the heavy handed side but could be mitigated. I managed to finish Tangaroa before finding out that the third chapter was on hiatus.

Then Chapter 3 released, which set this game back a bit:
[list]
[*]Caravan Town and Tangaroa were the first place where the devs started flirting with platforming, but this became an actual pain in the ass come the final segments of the game.
[*]Boss fights went from optional to required. The second boss became incredibly painful if you did not have some flippers and breathing tools stockpiled. The third is spread across three fights, with no indication on how exactly you're supposed to proceed, and could be much more easily resolved if you could put an arrow in their head from the start. In the end, these fights served to highlight just how poor combat was in this game.
[*]The narrative of the entire game was rewritten to change a certain character from chapter 1 from inept to the main bad guy, while also burying the separate plot of chapter 1's radio tower into a subplot that is left hanging come late chapter 3. Newer players may not have a problem with this, but as someone from Early Access, this shoehorning was irreconcilable.
[*]The last boss fight rewards a power tier for all of your tools, but at that point in the game you have nothing to use them on. What good is fighting the very last major boss fight of the game, only to be given your best tools afterwards? This makes it feel like chapter 3 was in fact cut short.
[/list]

It's understandable that chapter 3 was developed during the pandemic and that there should be some flexibility in when/how they deliver, but it was obvious when this chapter released that the developers just wanted to move on to a new game or IP. It's a shame that this game started with a strong premise but could not stick the landing."

495,great game to play coop with friends hope they make more games like this!
496,nice
497,"The combat is bad and basic as it gets.
Enemies have a ton of health, are incredibly aggressive, have big hitboxes and they kill you in a few hits.
Tools and weapons don't have much durability and you will keep crafting the same tools over and over just to explore a little. Which can be very difficult if you don't have storages boxes full of every resource, which can be difficult to get because of the shark, other enemies and overall tool durability.
And not to mention that when you die, you lose 90% of your inventory forever; so if you collected all the resources off an island and a stone throwing bird decides to not leave you alone, you pretty much did it all for nothing... then you wake up in your raft and the bird throws another stone at you and you died again while the shark is eating your raft.
Most of the ores and stuff you need and want are underwater, which will make the shark attack you, unless you manage to craft bait, which will keep him occupied for a minute or so.
Your hunger and thirst meter deplete very fast, which will kill you more often than not at the beginning of your game.

Basically, the difficulty of this game is highly artificial for no reason except to stop player progress, because the rest of the game really isn't challenging.

The only real gameplay are the story islands, which always default to;
-find notes
-find bluprints for new stuff
-clear a simple puzzle by collecting story items only present there 
-get the coordinates for the new island and go there
It gets repetitive but those are the only ways to really progress.

The story and characters aren't that interesting but the whole thing can be summarized with:
""Climate change done flooded the earth and now everyone is trying to survive in waterworld. Also there is a ton of garbage in the ocean.""

The only appealing and redeeming aspect of this game is building and customizing your raft.
[i](Be careful when building or destroying parts though, because if you destroy walls or floor pieces and you have anything attached to or placed on them, those things will simply disappear as if considered destroyed, be especially careful if you have storage boxes attached because you will lose the box and everything inside.)[/i]

The bad point is that the game has no replayability whatsoever and playing beyond the main story, just isn't really fun.
Maybe go into creative mode and build any rafts you want, but that's about it.

20 bucks for this game is alright.
Play it on easy mode though, it's not worth troubling yourself with unfair, unbalanced, janky enemies and mechanics."

502,"Amazing game, hope they make a Raft 2"
503,"I played through this co-op with a friend.  Crafting and resources all felt very fun and balanced.  Good mix of functional and decorative items.

My only complaints were that some of the puzzle solutions felt a little obtuse, I had to cheat and google some, and that a lot of advanced equipment and tech was handed to you very late in the game, past the point where it'd be worth reconfiguring your raft for."
504,Top notch crafting and building game!
505,"This game is just very meh.
I like grindy games, but there needs to be a point to it; a sense of accomplishment. Here, the constant struggle to survive/keep your raft from being eaten etc. is way too annoying. There are clues to more content and different islands later as you progress and can focus less on survival, but by that time I lost interest in the game entirely because of the abovementioned grind. The visuals and music are decent but not good enough to compensate for the game's flaws. IDK what's supposed to be the fun part of the game - the irritating survival mechanics? The exploration of repetitive and similar islands? Building your raft? Revealing the bigger story? If I want a ""crafting/building"" game, there are better alternatives; same goes for the story and for survival. Very disappointing game especially considering the hype."

I love the story now it's finished and I did start a fresh for the full game, just a few tips don't go crazy big with the raft as my FPS did start to suffer @ 1000 foundations and 3 story up and pray for RNG for the 2 rare islands and if I never see another anglerfish again will be to soon, there needs to be more spawns for them once you first see them as killing 50 of them that only have a few in 2 locations is a grind. over all really good game will defo be playing again sometime or hope Raft 2 gets made as I will miss Bruce the shark he is a good listener but his hugs hurt"
544,"Loved the concept, in early access, but stopped playing it for a long while, due to lack of content. Came back now, after both the decoration update and final release, and I've put twice as many hours into the game since. There's so much more to do now.

I love the building, more than anything else. The exploration is a little repetitive, and the story mode is....something to do? Works well as a tech ladder, if nothing else. If there's one thing I find myself griping about, is the constant eating and drinking. Granted, it keeps you busy, especially if you get into cooking, to avoid having to spam potatoes. At the very least, you shouldn't have to eat or drink as much, while sitting. Please give us that, at least. But the building is where it's at. Especially now that they've added horizontal pillars. And windmills have taken enough of the grind away, to make it easier to manage large boats now. Performance is good, even when building large rafts with many decorations. Think big, in your design.

I've heard that they'll continue to provide new content, even after the final release. I hope that's true, even if it's paid DLC (add-on, not sequel). Love just re-building and revising my raft (well, tall ship now), but I would love for more of a reason to use it. Need a reason to get those titanium shears and spears, as well as the advanced cookpot, that we know must be coming. Maybe some plates, that let us put ingredients on them (to simulate meals)? Bottles, glasses and more decorations? Or a sail guidance system (kind of a pain to get behind it and use it manually, on a big raft, and could work with multiple sails, for cool look)? Working diving helmet? Strictly underwater destinations, detectable with new sonar? Many possibilities remain."

579,"It is a very fun and exciting game there is no dull moment when your on the seas looking for trash or just kicking back and looking at your hard work there is 8 story islands, a rare island or two with a radio and different music tapes to find, so many different hats to collect, and some rare fishing and metal detecting rewards. No matter what your doing or already completed there is almost always more optional stuff to do so you dont get bored. It is fun with friends and by yourself so you dont feel obligated to play only with friends. I dont normally like a game for too long but this game has me always coming back for more. This game has amazing graphics that I would highly suggest trying even if just for a moment if your computer cant handle to much of these good graphics(much like mine) you can turn all of them down to as low as they can go which even still has some not to bad graphics but not so good as where it lags alot or you can do like me and turn only the settings you like the most for me it is texture but for you it could be shading or water. Overall it is the best game in a while always keeping you interested and if you dont like challenges and puzzles with the story you can develop your raft instead but to get some better items you will have to play some islands but you can look up tutorials there are some great ones out there that will get you in and out in a blink of an eye if you want. Overall a great game that has a good mix of grinding and difficulty while still being fun. One last last thing if you dont want to grind and get everything yourself they have creative if you just want to build a raft as well as peaceful"

587,"This game has potential, but is pretty broken in my opinion.  After 9 hours of playing 2 saves where the game ends up ruining my experience both times, I'm finished playing.  I will admit I was having fun, but spending 4 or 5 hours on a save for the game to death loop you out of nowhere is pretty aggravating.

First spawn I leave my raft at the shoreline of an island with the current pushing it into shore without an anchor (rookie mistake I know).  However the raft didn't run away from me out to sea.  Rather it pushed further and further into shore until it sunk into the sand underneath the island and left me alone on the island without any of my stuff.  Frustrating, but I learn I need an anchor and restart a new spawn.

Next spawn after several more hours I pull up to an Island with my sail, anchor, and paddle ready to go and get death looped immediately after I drop anchor.  Multiple birds take turns dropping rocks on my head so I only have maybe 10 seconds after I spawn to try to move my raft.  How is the player supposed to know that simply parking their raft containing hours and hours of resources in one place is going to death loop them?  

This really seems unbalanced and I just cannot recommend anybody spend time building up in this game.  It will break your save out of nowhere."

590,"This game is good if you just want a relaxing game after a long day, i go on raft to talk to the shark about my day to day life as a housewife"

592,Raft is a good game to play with your friends
593,"I was like, ""where is shark?"". and then was in mouth. shark is kil. no"

596,VERY GOOD
597,its fun

599,Great game and co-op with friends is makes it really great. Only wish would be that you could have others hop into a session you started and not have to be on for them to play.

602,its a really fun game
603,how do I start
604,"Don't get me wrong, it's an alright game, however I do have some issues with it.

The game is super repetitive, like to the point where it's really really boring. Yeah sure the game does throw some progression and new things to try and keep it fresh however you're still doing the same thing over and over again until you get a new thing and then you doing the same thing over and over again until you get a new thing, you get the point.

The shark, the seagull are there to ""keep you on your toes"" but they're just extremely annoying.

Well perhaps the game is not for me, however me and my friend just got bored really quickly and I don't understand how the game is this well received. There are many better survival experiences which are at a similar price point or even cheaper."
605,"The grind is boring. The game still looks like ass, especially all the animations. And everything that lives is hostile to you. Unrelentingly. If a creature is physically able to navigate to you, it [b]will[/b] come for you. On an island? unsafe. Near an island? try again. In the ocean? Consider yourself deceased. On your fucking raft? I got bad news."

615,"Great game, I think it's better with friends, though.  I enjoyed playing it solo, though I left it on passive because wrestling with a shark every few minutes isn't my idea of fun.  The rest of the game is good though!  Good story, good gameplay (except for frustrating jumping puzzles!).  Get it and play it with your friends.  :)"
616,Fun time especially with a friend
617,"OK game, even if it's a discount version of Rust/subnautica and everything looks the same.

Biggest problem will be your electricity bill as the game counts many users who reported GPU/CPU/APU stress usage whatever the graphic options entered and whatever fluidity they had, either good or bad (good in my case, but systematic 100% GPU stress on a 300watt/h graphic card, count the lost euros after playing 100hours...)."
618,"its a great game to kill hours on me and my friend killed 12 hours in what felt like 30 minutes

639,"If you're looking for a review on this game you've come to the wrong place, but if you're looking for an outstanding pie recipe you've come to the right place.

Ingredients:

1. 6 tablespoons unsalted butter
2. 1/2 cup white sugar
3. 1/2 cup brown sugar
4. 1/4 cup water
5. 1/4 teaspoon cinnamon
6. 1 pinch salt
7. 5 apples - peeled, cored and sliced
8. 1 pastry for double-crust pie

Directions:

1. Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C).
2. Combine butter, white sugar, brown sugar, water, cinnamon, and salt in a saucepan over medium heat. Bring to a boil, remove from heat and set aside.
3. Roll out half the pastry to fit a 9-inch pie plate. Place bottom crust in pie plate; pour in apple slices.
4. Roll out top crust into a 10-inch circle. Cut into 8 (1-inch) wide strips with a sharp paring knife or pastry wheel. Weave the pastry strips, one at a time, into a lattice pattern. Fold the ends of the lattice strips under the edge of the bottom crust and crimp to seal.
5. Pour butter-sugar mixture over top of pie, coating the lattice, and allowing any remaining sauce to drizzle through the crust.
6. Bake in the preheated oven for 15 minutes. Reduce heat to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C), and bake until the crust is golden brown, the caramel on the top crust is set, and the apple filling is bubbling, 35 to 40 more minutes. Allow to cool completely before slicing."
640,yes
641,"One of my favorite games, I'd say. I can lose myself just drifting around and often just take my time. Once in awhile, I'll pick it up again and just coast. I'm in no rush to complete the story, even with the new stuff that's come out. The music is great and peaceful. The story is kinda sad, I'd think, and I believe the loneliness is really felt in this game. Idk man. I just really like it."
642,this is a masterpiece
643,"The endgame is just ""Collect resources and decorate"". Grind and solve simple puzzles."
644,wwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwbad game
645,"very engrossing, even better multiplayer
"
646,"Raft is a difficult game to recommend out of the box. Playing single player is the most tedious experience ever where you're stuck in an endless loop of chores just to keep yourself alive. That's a core part of the survival game genre, but in this you never really reach a point of stability. You might unlock a better grill or an electric whatever, but you've still got to babysit it constantly but now the resource you're babysitting has shifted to battery power or whatever.. The worst is farming because it's entirely possible to pick an entire crop and not get a single seed to replant. Almost every single item has durability and most don't last very long so you're constantly making replacements for things like flippers and bows. Crafting trees don't make a lot of sense and you're constantly in search of more resources. Sure, this keeps you sailing for new islands, but the islands are basically all identical and exploring them isn't all that interesting after a while. Certain upgrades are not available until far too late in the game when they're not even useful anymore. Story islands are a nice change of pace but there aren't very many places to go.

So, what's keeping this from being a not recommended? Mods. With a few tweaks to resource management, item durability, farming, adding building options, etc. the game is a lot more tolerable. It takes much of the monotony out of the equation. 

To end on some positives, I love the aesthetic. Building the raft is quite fun. Playing with friends takes some of the tedium out of things by spreading it around at least. The game does a good job of keeping everything centered on the raft so it avoids the Minecraft problem of everyone fucking off into the mountains to never be seen again. Also there's a functional piano even if nobody else can hear it."
647,Very good game
648,"I enjoyed this game..... right up until the end. Some of the items I wanted to build required resources found at random. The last zone Utopia? Enjoy tedious nonsense puzzles and ""boss fights"" that are utterly without design ideas. The last zone feels like they forgot what game they were making, introducing mechanics never before used, and with their current respawn system is a load of s***.

I wish devs would stop rushing the ""end"" of a product if all it does is give us nothing. The trading posts? Whole bunch of nothing. Trash cubes? Good way to wastes resources the devs had no idea what to do with. Eggs? Never heard of them. Bees? As rare in game as they are going to be in real life. Devs had no continous thought going through this game, and it shows. Everything is tacked on, and previous items/mechanics are lost.

Also, screw the birds that drop rocks. Those are 110% bulls***"

663,"I really enjoy this game, but a couple weeks ago it simply stopped working. Running for a few minutes before crashing one day for no apparent reason, I've tried to report the issue and haven't gotten anywhere. It's a great game, and I'd love to play it haha"
664,good fun time
665,sucks imo
666,fun but really repetitive
667,"See early on I really enjoyed playing this game multiplayer, the survival and crafting elements were very fun and enjoyable. Exploring each of the islands and gathering resources was great. Even the first few story locations were great. But then as we grew closer to the end and more of the story closure, weakness began to appear such as sudden new mechanics that grew to frustrate both me and my friend. Overall this game is very mixed in my book and while the survival elements are nice, story elements are not quite there for me."
668,If you like rafts this is your game
669,love the gameplay and graphics
670,My girlfriend and I love playing this game together. She get's to build and make the raft pretty and I get to do the other things lol
671,shit fr do not buy this game
672,"I can't say enough good things about this game. The story aspects are fun and challenging, and we have just as much fun ignoring plot altogether and just focusing on our raft. If you like survival crafting, this will quickly become one of your favorite games. And if you have friends to play with, you'll fall in love with the sense of community and teamwork. 

There are only two complaints that I have about the game: rain doesn't know the difference between covered and uncovered areas (it even rains underwater, which is a trip), and you can't eat/drink/fish while seated. But those are easy flaws to overlook when you're sailing the high seas with your besties. 10/10, worth every penny."
673,bad
674,"Very much enjoying the game so far.  It has a pretty significant learning curve, so I restarted a few times as I figured things out, but now I have a groove.  There's lots to do and collect and I believe there is some storyline as well that I haven't stumbled into yet.  But I'll get there."
675,Very Good game in co-op its a slow burner but when you get in to the swing of it the enjoyment increases

684,"Fun game, easy mechanics for new players and a lot of fun. I've enjoyed the coop feature with my friends and def recommend."
685,The harshest survival game I've ever played. You have to make sure your resources are in order so you aren't scrambling for water or food. I wish the respawn system wasn't so punishing. Restarting isn't the best but once you get going it's manageable. I just got to the first plot point but enjoying it so far. I didn't play any of the early access.
686,"As a sandbox type game, the creative freedom you have makes it enjoyable to play. The world build it great through what I've seen."
687,"veery fun, you know its true cuz i spelt very wrong
"
688,This is great game if you are playing by yourself or with other players! I have had fantastic gameplay so far with no issues. The graphics are also beautiful. Get this game now!
689,"I started playing this game with a couple friends with pretty much no expectations and was just blown away by how good it is. We went in blind on hard. The mad scramble to literally stay afloat fighting off sharks and shooing birds away from our precious few potato crops was some of the most fun I've ever had. The game isn't without its flaws: the controls can be clunky at times and the combat is a bit lackluster. In summary grab a couple friends and just dive in blind. Great game.
"
690,good
691,this game is cool git it or i will kill your dog
692,"You play as one of two child geniuses who understand engineering to an astounding degree, who are even capable of improvising a makeshift bomb out of common every day items. :D The game runs on a good premise - a crafting/survival game where your raft serves as your base. Unable to build on land, the game encourages you to grow and build your raft from a pitiful 2x2 piece of debris, to a self-sufficient gargantuan monstrosity. That sense of growth and seeing the fruits of your labor is an undeniable dopamine hit. The music is also amazing, and the graphics walk the line between immersive realism and cartoonish casual very well.

However, in my opinion, there are still balancing issues, along with some minor bugs. There were instances where my character would be swimming in the water, and then suddenly be teleported back to my raft - likely the Unstuck function somehow being triggered. There were also instances of items disappearing from storage, and entity AI malfunctioning. But, having played numerous crafting/survival games, the most difficult aspect to get just right in a survival game is the rate of hunger/thirst deterioration.

I looked through many of the reviews and saw people commenting about having to eat and drink too often, and I thought, yeah, well, you see that said about every survival game. Unfortunately, after playing for myself, I have to agree say this is where Raft misses the mark.

There are only 2 bars to maintain: Hunger and Thirst, however they both drain at a rate that ultimately detracts from the more enjoyable crafting and building and exploring. It is especially brutal in early game. As you begin set adrift, by the time you see your first island, your character will start coughing. Once you do manage to figure out the crafting menu, you'll still only have a small water filtration unit and a small plastic cup. But hey, you should be okay after a cup... make that 5 cups of water to fill your thirst bar. Uh, devs, that's almost a liter of water.

You likely won't be able to disembark on the first island you encounter unless you manage to pull together a one time use anchor. But if you do, you also have the option of eating juicy fruits to fill hunger/thirst. Like, it only takes 6 pineapples, each the size of your head, to fill your thirst and most of your hunger. Most islands won't have that many pineapples. And the materials and time required to grow that many pineapples is still quite a bit on starting out. Watermelons are also an option for thirst. Just engulf 4 whole watermelons in one sitting. ""But have you tried fishing?"" Yeah, 5 whole cooked tilapia to fill your hunger bar. Catching that many will likely require more than one fishing rod as you'll want to save your pomfret and herring for shark bait.

And speaking of sharks, want to get rid of that nuisance by killing it? Sure, but it'll just respawn a couple minutes later. At least your reward will be a novelty shark head and 4 pieces of shark meat.... and it'll take all 4 of those cooked shark pieces to fill your hunger. Imagine being so hungry you could eat a whole shark.

Yes, there is a cooking stove, but those materials are relatively difficult to get early on and/or require prior meta knowledge if intended to obtained early. And even then, the meals/smoothies fill half your bar. How long does half a bar last? About a quarter of the day. So basically, on Normal difficulty, your char needs to eat at least two meals a day, or else they get so hungry they start to black out. xD And don't get me wrong, it's not in a ""dis gam too hard"" way. It's honestly a nuisance having to gulp down a small garden and a liter of water simply because you took a few minutes to organize your storage.

The game doesn't really balance risk/reward very well. Other survival games present high risk for high reward. Take down a strong enemy, and you'll be able to craft something equally amazing. Raft has more high risk/meh reward. ""Oh... a novelty head to clutter my storage. How nice..."" Craft a basic bow and 6 stone arrows for 9 planks, 4 rope, 2 vine goo, 1 metal ore, 3 stones, 6 plastic. It will require the full set of 6 stone arrows to fell that effing bird that can kill you in 3 hits (hope you made more or you better not miss). Your reward is, tada, feathers. ._. Why not make the screecher head a material that crafts a helmet that protects you from falling rocks - making the next screecher easier and represents overcoming that challenge? The shark head could be used to craft an underwater breathing headpiece, or perhaps a mounted shark head could slightly increase the interval between shark attacks? Oh. And tool durability... It's just.... (deep breath) It's just not fun. :/ 

The highlight of Raft is in building the raft itself. Although, I did also notice the build interface being finicky at times. The option to place an object will go in and out as the boat sways. (did the devs consider players would be building on a swaying boat?) But more importantly, it's fairly common to get immersed in the zen of decorating your boat... until your char starts coughing. How are you hungry and thirsty already after eating all those pineapples?! Other crafting/survival games have mechanisms for players to be able to enjoy building while putting off concerns of managing resources bars. Minecraft, the game that started this whole trend, only drains hunger when the player runs or jumps, allowing carefree building for hours on end. And when a char does get hungry, just a cooked steak or two does the trick.

I'm aware this game only got out of beta a while ago. I'm not certain if there are plans for continued updates. Raft is okay for what it is, however the balance issues likely will chase away more casual players who just want to make a fancy boat. The building interface also needs work. Also, hey, this game makes sharks look bad. No self-respecting predator would behave like that. ;[

A few other things
- Ability to pause in solo play. Also pause while the game is minimized. Considering how quickly the bars drain, if you get a phone call while playing and don't exit to main menu, you'll likely come back dead. ""Don't Starve Together"" has done this - while not including pause during multiplayer - and it too is intended as a multiplayer game.
- Support beams that can be placed diagonally. And for that matter, being able to place decorations and objects against diagonal walls. Did we learn nothing from the Sims 2?
- More user control in building interface. That is, rather than waiting for the game to pop and connect objects
- COLLISION! The physics engine is great, however if player's raft hits the tiniest rock sticking out the water or one of those abandoned rafts, it will spin the entire player raft around - regardless of size.
- Why are crowbars and bolt cutters one-time use? ;["

Why does a bird take so many arrows to kill? Why are logs and large trees unable to be chopped down? Why is the bucket only for milk? The experience just ends out being a mess where you can often just feel like you fell into a trap for not playing exactly the way the game intends."

735,"fun game

736,kinda fun but f**k the bird
737,"If you just want to chill, fish some plastic out of the ocean and poke a shark in the nose with a spear every now and then, I highly recommend playing this on easy mode.

Playing this with friends on a higher difficulty however is like building ikea furniture together - either you get really annoyed with each other for not refilling salt water in the purifier, or you realize how seamlessly in sync you are. 

10/10 recommend so far (as long as my duo doesn't take the last metal ingots without smelting more again)"
738,raft is a fun game exspor and many more ways to have fun
739,FUN GAME!!!!!!!!!
740,Build a cool raft and explore random islands while discovering the remnants of humanity. Pretty neat for the mechanics but I found the story a little weird at points and convoluted for the sake of setpieces. 7/10

751,"iTS STILL VERY BUGGY!
I think i found a buig where if you open the storage it still appears on screen and you cant interact with anything, even when you die it still appears especially when you are ;ooking through your crafting tab. Its fun and difficult but the bugs still need to be fixed.
"
752,"Very fun and relaxing, however i do recommend friends as it could easily be overwhelming solo."

759,11 Hours in love it so far. Pretty hard at the start but life becomes a little easier on down the line.
760,"A fun little survival crafting game which the game's talented developers have built up into an engaging adventure over the high seas. The experience of building and maintaining a ship is particularly addictive, this game being the sort that you can get lost in until the wee hours of the morning. There's a little bit of jank in the game mechanics, but its the fun kind of jank that lets you do stuff like clip into an island or build wacky structures. Word of warning: the survival mechanics such as the hunger and thirst meters can get particularly annoying, but they are manageable without much effort. Overall a great game for people named Nathan."
761,ITS FUN IF YOU GET HOW THINS WORK
762,fun game...my son really loves to let go and build his own super raft!
763,Fun as fuck
764,Very fun game. Minecraft esq. It drops you in the game without tutorials which I think adds to the game.
765,"not a shark killer ? the peaceful mode then is for you.

"
766,"Best survival game I've ever experienced and I don't feel like I'm that far into it watching the trailers lol. It's very rewarding for figuring out how to do something but not so complicated where you get frustrated and want to give up. I don't decorate the raft as much as figure out how to build bigger and better things to help progress the story but I spent my first 2 weeks with no idea there was a 'Story' line. It wasn't until a buddy jumped into my game and asked if I had built a certain item yet to get the story kicked started. I was still having a blast and could of gone another month of just floating island to island collecting items and building up my raft and been very content lol. The story line is intriguing enough to want to get the the next location but I still explore random islands and take my time, I love how can do whatever you want and it doesn't force you to get to the next mission or story island. Highly recommend this one!"
767,"Very good game. I think they should add more to do after you beat all of the story and chapters to make it more endless, but overall good game and I would play it again."
768,"Absolutely LOVE this game! I just finished up the storyline (no spoilers here) and cannot wait to do another playthrough, perhaps at an higher difficulty. The ability to build and take your time through the game makes this a must have in my book."

779,its gas fasho
780,"I like the idea and I loved creating my raft. But found it too difficult and unbalanced compared to other survival/build games.  I realize they encourage multiplayer but I am a solo gamer and had to find mods to make this game more enjoyable/doable.   The resources are out of wack especially titanium.  I finished the game without being able to build many of the items that require it.  Most of the islands I came to did not have titanium but did find a bunch of masks.  Having said that - there is a lot of room to improve this game.  One odd thing about multiplayer (if I were to find someone to play) is that you don't get your own raft.  Also, would be great to be able to build a base that you can go back to."
781,"its actually a very good survival game, though the shark and other enemies attack way too often honestly, expand your raft and find big places! its very fun but the early game can be difficult/boring but its worth it once you play a few hours then the real fun starts"

806,gud
807,"it is fun and u can get games

808,"I got this game as a means to relax and do something fun. Glad it has Peaceful mode to keep the things at bay. I have had loads of fun floating about and exploring the reefs and islands. The story is a nice way of adding extra interest and introducing advanced building options. I would like to have seen a simple tutorial in the first couple minutes of the game, seeing as I had no idea about the crafting table or the building hammer on my first game attempt (Normal mode), which ended up becoming unplayable after 15 minutes. I can definitely see myself playing quite a bit more of this game, even after over 60 hours."

First couple of hours in, we got to familirise the game and later not sure what to do afterwards. It was fun then got dead extremely fast. We had to learn that we couldn't build a new raft, so don't lost your raft!! Hungry status is a bit annoying af.

Scrap mechanics is more funner than this.

862,"Cozy game, but somehow the waves managed to crash my raft into a large island where my escape attempts caused 2 paddles to break and I don't have materials to build another. This means my game is more or less over as I have no way to continue my journey and honestly it's frustrating and feels like something the devs should have thought of a fix for since this does not seem like an uncommon thing that might happen."

"
865,bob keeps biting my boat and my friend is in plank debt.
866,"i like, good wirth playing with friends"
867,"Would ""Meh"" if it was an option.

The game starts out pretty promisingly. Just yourself, a couple of tools, and a wide ocean for you to explore. You explore story islands, unlock new technologies that make your life easier or open up new aspects of the game. I had the best time here, exploring, struggling to stay alive, gathering resources to make my life easier, etc.  The first three story islands were great. Slowly scaling up, but still feeling worth exploring. 

But then the story islands just start getting worse, bit by bit.  Larger islands, less to find, more maze-like, worse looting experience (I hope you like opening individual drawers to see if anything is inside), annoying gimmicks. Balance of later unlocks feels off (a fuel-powered battery charger is almost completely obsoleted just two islands later).

I have a wide variety of issues with the game, but none are crippling. The upshot is that there seems to be a reasonably healthy modding community for the game; I look forward to seeing the added potential the modding community brings."

917,very good game
918,Its much fun playing with friends
919,"this game really was way more fun than i expected it to be. you can go at it solo, but having even 1 friend with you, makes the crafting and upgrading become so much easier. its not just endless floating around on a raft, its much more than that. its exploring islands, caves, underwater structures, following a decently in depth storyline. that being said, the crafting is virtually endless, in possibility. you could make an old victorian era style ship, or you could craft a wooden floating millenium falcon. the only thing stopping you, is the amount of time and effort you put into it."
920,"For solo play? Get ready to have your hands full of repetition: Scavenge, forage, cook food, purify water, grow potato, ward of seagulls, tell Bruce ""NO! BAD SHARK!"". Rinse and repeat.

For coop? Excellent fun, especially when you can alleviate the constant busy grinding with sharing the work load and now you actually have time to build the raft, explore islands, etc.

So, for single player 4/10, for coop 9/10"

923,It's a great multiplayer game. I enjoyed completing the story of the game and look forward to seeing my raft slowly improve with all the upgrade blueprints we discovered. 10 out of 10 and would play again.
924,It’s an awesome game to play alone or get a bunch of friends together and play. Highly recommended.
925,"Its like one of those games for me, when I play I play for hours and then when I stop I don't play for months. It's very entertaining and time consuming, I recommend it if you're having one of those slump days with nothing to do. quite bit slow to progress tho unless you put in the hours :D"

939,Good fun game with friends
940,"Raft is a truly wonderful and enjoyable game, it allows you to explore your imagination to your wildest content making virtually any raft or any however many rafts you wish to own. You can build steamboats, yachts, banana boat, or if your someone who prefers a less serious attempt at survival, your friends can just build a large and less than flattering ""T"", and populate the raft with a large quantity of lucky cats. All in all raft is a great game, and while I haven't made it to the final ""objective island/location"", I very much am hyped to see whats in store for myself. 10/10 would and will continue to play the game."
941,"This game is great for idle time. It feels productive and challenging but also calming, at least in my opinion. If you are a creative and logical mind, you'll enjoy this game."

976,this game is really fun and I've had this game for a long time so in a nutshell i would definitely recommend this game to anyone  (especially to starter's) because the controls are very simple
977,A fun sandbox game with decent story elements to follow between building your raft.
978,IHA OOK

You start on a small raft (therefore the name comes from, obviously), then you gatherr some resources and expand to a bigger raft with more utilities.
Kinda like a basebuilding and survival game combined. You get the most out of it, when playing with a friend.
Exploring tothether is much more fun than alone.
I played it with my little sis and we had much fun. Some good laughs and sometimes a little bit confusion where to sail in this big ocean (in a good way)."
988,"Really good survival game, i was debating it, bit the bullet and thoroughly enjoy it,

Just buy it if your debating, always something to do, craft, build, find, explore, or eat lol"
989,"Raft isn't just a matter of crafting and survival, it's a curious mystery to solve with a story that slowly reveals itself. Drifting from island to island, chopping down spare trees for wood and digging up ore from the seabed eventually allowed me to craft technology like a radio receiver, a battery, and some antennas. A signal then led me to a mysterious, rusting radio tower poking out of the sea, and the clues I gathered there gave me a pip on my radar screen. This led me to another location to explore, loot, and obtain coordinates to the next story location. The journey that began as aimless drifting now had some destinations to focus on, which gave all that crafting more of a purpose than simply catching enough fish to avoid starvation.

Overall the game makes for a solid survival title, definitely worth owning. Twitch and Youtube streamers helped to bring Raft the much-needed attention and critical acclaim since its release.

From the thrilling storyline and gameplay that captures the player’s attention, Raft gifts its players gameplay that they will not forget anytime soon. With all of the existing and emerging survival games in the market, Raft stands out as a unique and genuine experience."
990,"This is a great game to play with a partner, spouse, loved one, enemy, child, or potato. There are a few things that make me wonder how it isn't in Beta, but overall I've really enjoyed bonding with my spouse while playing this. It's enjoyable. That's the right word. Enjoyable."
991,good sussy wood floating game

995,Rumhaaaaaaaam!
996,Fun
997,One of my favourite games. 10/10
998,i love the game wish there was a server list though would be way more fun then playing alone
999,"its not a game that you sweat at. its a game you chill out to, which is nice for a change. although it being a chill game, it still manages to have an intruiging story and overall is very fun"

1014,"When I first got the game I thought it was just a survive as long as you can / sandbox kinda game. To my surprise their was a story to the game and it does a real good job easing you into it. The story line isn't forced which is nice so you can play however you want but its nice to play a survival game without being forced to do certain objectives to just play the game. It has been fun, will continue to play for some time."
1015,holy crap 9/10
1016,it is so gamign
1017,Very fun
1018,really fun game but its boring on your own.
1019,"very good. shark is cool if you name him/her, I named mine Jim."
1020,"Overall a really enjoyable crafting/survival game with a lot of cool ways to build out and customize your raft. I played with a friend and we had a great time running through the story.

I liked visiting the different set-piece islands, solving their puzzles, and piecing together the story.

My only real gripe with the game is the combat, overall it feels pretty clunky. It's serviceable against the standard enemies but pretty rough during the boss fights. The last fight was particularly rough, IMO. If the [spoiler]green hyena[/spoiler] had killed us another time or two we would have called it there and probably never finished."
1021,lol
1022,This is a fantastic survival game! It works well for both players looking for a chill time and for hardcore survivalists. I couldn't recommend this game enough. It quickly became one of my all time favorite games!
1023,"good
"
1024,no.
1025,"Starts off fun, plenty of difficulty settings to tailor the experience for you.

I wish I could have the hunger/thirst needs of the highest difficulty but without the perma death (if playing solo since no one can come and ress you).
Too many ""bullshit"" deaths. Like suddenly having a rock dropped on you without any warnings of a big bird being on the island.

You unlock more blueprints from progressing the story, but once you do (fairly short, maybe a 6-12'ish hour experience if you purely aim for it) what reason is there left to continue playing?

Like once your boat is shark proof and you realize how few variations of islands there are I felt no motivation to continue playing after completing the story.

This isn't Sea of Thieves where going on adventures with friends has the same vibe.

Cooking is fun and some of the best parts was finding new recipes to go beyond grilling fish and veggies and making real dishes. 

It's fun to build the raft, but it takes too much resources to build the basic floors/walls/support beams. You don't get very far on it and with how late into the story you get the cool blueprints you don't get to fully develop your ship by the time you're done.

The shark boss was terrible btw. And the final boss was a very underwhelming damage sponge.

I wish there was more out there in the ocean. Like how it's marketed on the store page that you can meet people. You can't. Not until you finish the story and get one island with people on it. It's just you and every single animal suffering from rabies as they aggro you from across the moon.

Pro tip if you want to loot the coral reefs around islands: Park your raft on the other side a bit away. The sharks circles your raft, but only attacks it if you're on it. That way you can dip into the water without the need of of bait (which is crap) to keep the sharks away. And seeing as the most important materials are there except for wood, it's well worth to do it in peace."

1029,Chapter 3 is disappointing (0_0)
1030,I see that shark more then my family
1031,"lots of fun, Great with Friends."
1032,"Personally i loved the game then the final chapter released and it just ruined it for me, part of the reason i loved the game before was you where alone you could just survive, no dialog, no NPC. nothing like that. then came the final chapter which not only added NPC but dialog a much more story based adventure and generally just added stuff that in my eyes was the entire reason the game was entertaining before so you can play it if thats what your into but im just not a fan of the game anymore but thats just my opinion."
1033,"Lots of fun if you have friends to play with! Can play on your own but,  much better with others :)"
1034,Get this game if it's on sale and you have a friend to play with or it gets really boring
1035,"amazing game i love so very much 
"
1036,Yes.  The only raft game for me.
1037,"If you do it, and you do it right, you don't do it wrong!"
1038,"hi.
me and my friend wants to play and we have recive the connection issue error 
anybody know have to fix that???
"
1039,"A grand voyage on the sea, the wind in your hair, the vastness of the ocean blue ahead of you....shit. Your raft is only 4 squares, but you're tenacious and determined to make it the best damn raft of your life. 

I fucking loved this game. I was actually fairly sad that it's already over, and I'll more than likely play it again before a year passes. 

There's only a few nitpicks that I wish could be addressed, and with some QoL updates, but it's nothing they should worry about right now. They've made a great game with a story that's intriguing and enjoyable. - I wish there was a post-game story or locales. I wish there were more enemies to engage with. I wish there were more people to interact with (I get that it's a post-flooding scenario, but still). I wish there were more ores/plants/recipes. I wish you could obtain certain materials through other means...scrap. By the end, my friend and I had build a beast of a raft, and had enjoyed our journey. We hope to awaken back on our raft someday if they add more updates. Until then, safe sailing!"
1040,Best game ngl
1041,sso good game
1042,"I REALLY HATE that you're game is designed it way that is either play multiplayer 100% of the time or get an experience that feels either too easy to the point of feeling like I'm being treated like a child or that it becomes a hostile experience that dying becomes a save killer. Where hours spent trying to get back to the point in a new save that I was in the prior one are wasn't cause all the items I need to try again can't be recovered. You designed a balanced game, then choose to make it unbalanced unless someone was willing to either invite another player, likely with a very different play style, or mod the thing into something actually use-able. And no being able to mod a game to make it play-able isn't an excuse not to fix your broken game. It just tells players that you don't care what they want. No matter how SIMPLE it may be. I really wanna enjoy what you've made. But just knowing that the devs choose to create such a headache makes me wanna go play a souls game instead. It'd be more zen to die again and again in that. Cause playing that felt less punishing than Raft. Cause at least that game felt like it was balanced like it was designed to be. I am so tired of playing a game I love so much of to hit a wall and fall into a pit I can't climb back out of.

PLEASE PLEASE... Just add the ability to keep inventory and have the shark/enemies actually be a challenge"

It's a bit of a strategy game as you have to find certain materials and craft certain things to help you. but overall it's a solid game for the $20.00 that you gotta spend"
1057,"really fun, played with my boyfriend and we just really enjoyed ourselves, we played for over three hours!"

1059,"You start on a 2x2 square of wood.  No resources, no food, no water.. even though it surrounds you.  The one item you start with is your trusty hook.  You use that to collect resources from the sea safely.  If you're feeling brave, just swim it and get the things you want.  Watch out for Bruce though!  Took me a couple of deaths to work out the purifier and the fact you also need a damned cup!  Food was easier to figure out, fishing rod, grill, wood... done!

Ey-up... what's that shark doing?  It's eating my raft!  Little sod took my purifier!  Warning... don't build important things on an edge that the shark can eat.  Not until you can reinforce the foundations so he stops eating them.  You can deter the shark (Bruce) by stabbing him with the pointy end of a stick, but it's hit and miss whether you were observant enough to catch him in the act.   I'd play it safe if I were you.

Once you understand the basic mechanics, the game gets more fun.  Building your raft/home is limited only by your imagination and your ability to generate resources.  Big planters for trees, nets for all your other basic goods needs... Bigger is indeed better in this game, It allows you to mass produce all the things you'll need for an epic build.

The survival side is rather forgiving, while there's a need for food and water, it's not such a chore that you have no time to focus on other things.  In multiplayer we were just ignoring it and dying.  All you need is a bed and you can get resurrected with no loss of items or durability and at half hunger and thirst.  Very cost effective way to play... just so long as your mate puts you in a bed and not on a desert island.

My biggest bugbear was the fact I was unable to repair tools.  It just seemed silly I could make new ones but not repair existing ones at a lower resource cost.

1073,officer she was 18 in dog years
1074,i'm on a raft fool
1075,this game is phenomenal so good with the concept however it would be cool to have more island not needing to be part of the story but could be like a story island creating a endless adventure id say there be like 15 or so more islands like the story ones but with little story about it i also feel like the ending is missing something and i think there should be a blueprint list hope for more content dosent need to be story related
1076,"good fun
"
1077,If You're looking for a relaxing exploration survival game that you can play with friends then this game is for you. I've been enjoying it immensely myself.
1078,"good game and fun with friends but locations were too close togather to really to need or use the late game items 

Pros
interesting story line
Fun
Easy to do progress
certain items that make life much easier
freedom on how the raft should look
bosses arent too hard
puzzles at each location
can play with friends

Cons
Locations are too close together
after balboa it feels like you spend more time at the locations than on the water
inventory always feels to small
the late game electric items arent nesscessary and with how hard titanium is to get with out trading post they become uncraftable anyway
me and my friend were able to beat the game on a starter raft with minor expansions

Overall 10/10 would play again"

1090,The end of this game is completely idiotic.....it turns into nothing but a jump fest that has to be timed exactly right or you have to constantly re do over and over and over....i guess the developer ran out of ideas on how to make an intelligent and thoughtful game  and decided to take a page out of something made in 1980....I honestly cannot recommend this game and I wish someone would of told me how much frustration and thoughtlessness went into the ending....

1103,"Shark likes to eat wood,"
1104,Low stress fun
1105,"[b]Hesitant yes, and only if you play with friends.[/b]

The game can be very grindy so having extra people is needed to keep the pace going. It's not a boring game, but everything outside of the story areas is a repetitive loop. It's chores between story points. It's fun to find and then explore these locations since they are the only unique ones in the game.
Biggest flaw in the entire game is the final few progression points. They throw a lot of new recipes at you in the final tier and you won't have time to get more than 1 or 2 before reaching the final area. The biggest problem by far, and one I cannot believe made it into the game, is that you unlock the final tier of tools and more recipes AFTER beating the game.
Unless you intend to keep playing on the same grindy islands you've been playing for 20 hours already, you won't see more than 1 or 2 of the entire final tier of 15+ recipes and items.

Overall a very lukewarm yes if you want to kill a few nights with friends."
1106,no sex :(
1107,if you know how to mess with stuff the game becomes even more fun that it already is.

1110,"""shark is kil"" ""no"" ""sharek is destroy your entire base!!!!"" ""no"" ""kil die"" ""no"" 

Thank you for listening to my in-depth review."
1111,"Ah Raft.......

If someone asked me to explain how I spent so many hours in this game, I don't think I can. As far as the genre is concerned, this is a pretty simple game. There isn't a ton of crafting options, the crafting is pretty easy to get going (for the most part)

So how did I play nearly 350 hrs? I think this was similar to The Forest (for me) in that, I almost behaved as if I was ""Roleplaying"" in the game, for lack of a better explanation.

I would literally find myself logging in, and talking to myself about the tasks I needed to get done that day, like I was actually in some post-apocalyptic, waterworld type environment. I did this with The Forest, and I got completely swept away by that game.

Also, I tend to like games that have simpler crafting mechanics, but if you push the games abilities to the limits ( I don't mean breaking the game, but push the limits of what it WANTS you to be able to build) you can actually build some pretty cool stuff.

I quite enjoy that in a crafting game, so I got very absorbed in this one. 

Let's just say, I don't really have a raft, it would be better defined as an aircraft carrier....with expansions lol

Lots of fun to be had.

I always leave Bruce a floor to nibble, cuz I'm a nice guy!"

1133,"Really Impressed!

It's a bit of a struggle at the start but there are surprises and wonderful little additions around every corner.  There was more points of interest than I was expecting and each has a unique and fun theme.  The progression had a good pace and builds good momentum as you move into the end game.  Overall, was surprised at how much I enjoyed it.

Yes, there are a few aesthetic issues and things I would do different for end-game.  The waves coming through the bottom of raft are weird (which you can eliminate with the motion sickness mode) but my biggest bit of feedback is once you've completed the points of interest and unlocked all the top-tier tools and machines, all that's really left to do is try to make my raft as cool as possible and the focus shifts to building and decorating.  Once you get to that point, the constant manual need to continue producing fuel, food, batteries, etc. becomes more of an annoyance than a part of the game and would like to see top-tier items be much more durable, require fewer replacements, and allow the player to just make the raft beautiful!

Again, really enjoyed and would be super interested in any additional content released for the game or any other projects from this studio.  Nice Job!"
1134,"Raft is one from many other survival games that uses oceanic setting. And It really feels fresh, but only for a couple of hours. Then you start noticing how the devs poorly managed this unique concept.
The game suffers badly from the lack of the content, so the developers decided to build several obstacles to hide it and make the game longer.
For instance, your character is always hungry and thirsty, so you have to carry a lot of food because the food doesn't recover much energy.
The next thing is your inventory. You don't have much space, and the size of a stuck is limited to 20 pieces of something. This is too small number. You can easily fill up your inventory just by simply running around your raft for 5 mins and collecting the garbage gathered by the nests.
And one more annoying thing is story islands, having huge size and being 90% empty is such a disappointment for this game, You have to prepare a lot of food beforehand to board them.

I think this game deserves the neutral recommendation.
I hope other developers will learn from these mistakes and make a better game in this setting."

1183,really fun
1184,"This is a great game if you like building/looting for 45 seconds before you have to figure out how to drink or eat again. Also, equipment breaks constantly. There's a lot of unrewarding, tedious grind to be had here. Just really, really tired of survival games that require eating 30 fish and drinking 20 jars of water a day to survive."
1185,this game my life
1186,A little boring at first but the story gets interesting. So much better in multiplayer.

1220,"First rating of a game. Raft is a survival game very different from others. With base building, using resources wisely, and adventure in its own special way. This has been the most relaxing but oddly still thrilling survival game ive ever played. I have lost many hours just changing my ship to my liking without even diving into much of the story yet. I finally finished today after 50 hours of play i would easily put this in top 3 survival games i have played.  The only thing that would make it more perfect would be a bigger mixture of islands and differences in them. Not that they didnt have enough but just would have added more to it. I wish i could use certain end game items before the story was finished. Overall amazing game thank you"
1221,Shark go brrr
1222,super fun game to play solo
1223,NICE
1224,"Beautiful game, wish i spend more time decorating and building. 
"
1225,"This game is SO GOOD!

It feels nice floating atop my raft on the calm waters... Constructing the raft of my very dreams (which would seem very complex, if you hadn't seen them for yourself...) AHEM, and boy the combat in this game really makes it exciting! Master the technique of murderlizing the shark, you'll be in food BUSINESS, BABY!!! Still cool, check it out! :)"

1229,10/10 - The vast ocean brings not only story but great fun with all aspects of the game. The 57h spent on the game is beyond anything I could of expected. It is a shame a game like this has come to an end but none the less I would hands down recommend if you are looking for something to relax and play through.

1238,good play
1239,This game is very fun definelty worth the money fun with friends and its acctually has a story to it.
1240,"The game would be really fun, but it is super unpolished and it feels like the developers rushed to just fully release the game. There are a lot of bugs and the game is very janky."
1241,fgzds
1242,FUN
1243,"A terrific multiplayer survival-light experience. The exploration is fun, the puzzles enjoyable and the building / crafting systems just deep enough to add some heft. Hard to believe that the devs pulled this together from the original alpha state.  Unlike most survival games these days, the materials grind is not bad. Solid Co-op experience with no technical issues."
1244,"wtf 
i bought this game not to long ago then didn't play it for a while cause i wanted to wait for the final update
but now i gotta pay 28.95 again to play like seriously wtf
plz fix this because it wasn't a half bad game either i'm just not willing to pay that much twice"

1267,i bought the game for my friend and he never played with me xD
1268,"Honestly, didn't expect to love the game as much as I have but it lived up to my expectations (which I always have high expectations) and then some. I'm pretty sure I am playing the game wrong but hey, I am 6hrs in and love it nonetheless."
1269,Love this game so much. Definitely recommended for friend groups.
1270,One of my favorite game to play when I need to relax and get lost in its vast universe. I love the latest update and I absolutely recommend you play it with your friends or by yourself. I can't think of a single con besides that nasty evil Shark lol
1271,Very fun game the plot is good the graphics are good I like how you are able to mess with graphics I like the variety of tools and types of rafters you can be.
1272,Raft
1273,with my 34 hours in its a good game but the one thing I do have to say is the plastic is a annoying thing to get with the jugs so if they could do something like maybe make a wider radius to pick up it I would recommend all the way but its a good game and its better when your playing with people like Bereghostgames also Markiplier.

1279,"No tutorial, sh**y controls"
1280,"[b]Why the negative review?[/b]
Quite simply, the game has very basic building blocks, very few in fact, so few that it's just a matter of inputting a 'lucky' random seed until you hit jackpot and are able to get traction. Until then, it's just retry after retry doing the same minigame not dissimilar to these claw machines you find in arcades. 

It's very basic for a game that's been so long in development, and suffers from many issues, the worst one being the story mode being almost a second thought, something added at the end. We could have had a great firewatch meets survival in an open world settings, instead we get a repetitive, unoriginal, uninspired 'survival sim' straight out of the great pit of survival sims.

You have much better choices out there, and if you like a good story, definitely look elsewhere: this is not it."
1281,very cool :thumbsup:
1282,"This game is AMAZING! The story is so good and i just love it. You can customize your raft and your way of playing as well. I just love how creative the community get with it.

9/10

Highly recommended!"
1283,best survival game
1284,"Some of the animations and interactions are a little scuffed, but that's the charm of it. More fun to play with friends than alone though."

1286,Fun survival game.
1287,"Half of my raft, that i spent hours making, got snaped out of reality with last updates. Feel bad for developer's attitude towards players."
1288,this game is basic survival game whith god expirience what would happened if you survived a plane crash into a ocean full of trash
1289,"I played for about 15 hours before I even started story mode, and I've played with different friends in 4 world simultaneously. It's a different experience every time and great replay value.

My only downside was it felt the end of the story gave a lot a bit late, but if you're like me and happy to continue building and sailing beyond the end of the story then it's not that big of a deal."

1302,"this shark ate my raft, I killed his bloodline"
1303,"I highly recommend this game. It solves most of the issues I have with other survival games such as dont starve or the forest by making players staying on a raft. I had a blast with friends customising and helping each other on the raft. Good that there is a shark to keep us on our toes too. Also, really like the story too. give me a water world feel. 9.5/10"
1304,"It's a little bit harder than Minecraft, just a little bit, and still fun and worth it tho."

1307,Good crafting game and played with my kids little bit
1308,"Great chill game, the ending fight felt kinda rushed on the devs part however, at least compared to some of the other ""boss fights"" in this game. 

I kinda hope theirs more content added on to the game later, because after getting all the upgrades I felt no real point to continue playing anymore. That being said, well worth the full price of 20 dollars, a def must buy when it's on sale."

1315,"Dull, lacking in actual gameplay, and little more than an extended scavenger hunt with asinine mechanics."
1316,"killed brucey, found peace."
1317,yes yes very good gaem
1318,it fun
1319,Help I'm addicted. I forget my own bodily functions while playing this. My irl stat bars are fucking dying. Is it worth it? Absolutely.
1320,"It is great to play with friends and solo, different play experience each way you play and it depends on who you play with. This game is addicting and fun!!"
1321,awesome game. My wife and I play together. Very fun
1322,"This is a fun and relaxing game. Has a minimal storyline, but enough to be engaging. I have enjoyed playing both coop and singleplayer. Fun and difficult enough to adults to enjoy but on the peaceful mode it is easy enough for my six year old to play and not get upset about it being too hard."
1323,game fun
1324,"if you have a group of friends with a lot of time on their hands and who are willing to play with you and who know how to f*ck around a bit then this game is extremely fun. BUT if thats not the case then i don't recommend this game because it just simply becomes extremely boring extremely fast.

(edit: yes i say it becomes boring really fast when you play alone yet i have a decent amount of hours in the game. thats because i didn't play it alone most of the time. i have played it alone at some point tho and therefor i thought id share my experience)"
1325,"very fun game to play with friends, if u dont have friends then it sucks to be you"
1326,boring ass game you just kill a shark every 5 minutes
1327,"I got killed by a shark, stabbed a shark, lost my raft, built another, shot a bird, build a farm, died of dehydration, friend picks me up, revived, died of hunger
20/10"
1328,"Very good! A game where its very hard to get burnt out of!!!! 10/10 Game, its even more fun with a friend! Personally I could sit down and play this game for hours. Definitely recommend playing this game, especially if you like to grind for stuff."
1329,This is fun to play if you like survival games. I would reccommend.
1330,its fun to play
1331,Great Game
1332,"honestly fuck that shark
"
1333,"I am a 45 yo father, probably one of the oldest people playing this game. I am a single farther to my Son, who is 14 now. My son got this game for Christmas in 2021 from his uncle, so we installed it on his computer and he started playing. By the end of the week he had 24 hours on this game. This was horrible for me, as it was already hard for me to find ways to spend time with my son, as he is always out with his friends or just watching YouTube. So I decided to make a Steam account and get this game to see if I could maybe play alongside him. I loaded into the game, picked my character and started playing but I was stuck on what you where supposed to do. I asked my Son for help and he hosted a game for me to join. I loved it as it was the best time I had spent with my Son since my wife had died. This game has ever since brought me and my son closer again and now we actually spend time together outside the house together as well. This game reminded me that there's fun to be had in everything, and it has brought both me and my Son many happy memories"
1334,"I'm 38, and work too many hours to put real time into a game anymore. But I really appreciate the ""pick your own pace"" raft comes with. I can settle my soul while I just drift for a while, or get into some of the mechanics of the bigger islands and pushing story-line if I feel like it. It's a clean game, gets actual content updates (and fixes when needed) and I really appreciate it for what it is."
1335,Awesome
1336,Very fun game for solo or multi player
1337,Very nice
1338,"this is a game that i play with my dad, weve had so mutch fun and have bonded alot, i definently recomend you to play this with family and freinds"
1339,good
1340,This is the kind of game you can just absolutely vibe out on and just have a good time. 10/10 would recommend.
1341,"I absolutely recommend Raft to anyone who enjoys survival/building games, especially now that the game is finally finished it's truly worth it! 

Nevertheless, I am kinda sad I didn't wait for the full release... I did at least 4 playthoughs with my buddy and while waiting for new content to be added, I got a bit tired and didn't really enjoy endgame as much as I'd hoped. We spent so many hours building, decorating and just chilling in the game that it wasn't exciting anymore, sadly. 

As of now August 2022, it feels like there is little replayability (unless you wanna just go ham in creative for a couple of hours), even though a lot has been added to the game. I hope the devs plan to improve that aspect of Raft in the future, I'd love to have a reason to start another world at some point, even if the story remains the same.  

*****SPOILER***** Actually, the ending could use improvements in terms of the rewards you get in my opinion (i.e: instead of blueprints and decor only/again, why not give the player a plot of land and a hefty amount of resource, so the player can finally settle somewhere?)  *****SPOILER*****"
1342,yes
1343,it slays tbh
1344,"Another great game. I enjoyed it from the start. The game is tough to get used to and can be aggravating at times, but if you are smart in the beginning, you can really set yourself up for success. The new updates have only improved my love for this game. New items being added, new bosses, and new locations. Can't wait to see what is added next!"
1345,nice
1346,Shark 👍
1347,"""good things come to those who wait"""
1348,"good
"
1349,"The game is fun and relaxing yet also hectic and frustrating at the same time. The game is quite easy to get the hang of and the battle mechanics might be a bit lackluster. But it doesn't really matter as the core of this game for me, is to gather resources to build your raft while exploring (and surviving) the sea."

1394,A well brought story of a world flooded suitable to all ages.

1402,SUCKS!!!!
1403,"It's a solid game and well worth your time. I play a ton of survival games and I think the closest comparison here is probably Subnautica (one of my favorites for sure). Subnautica has a lot more polish overall (and I'm guessing a bigger budget I'm sure), but Raft has a distinct flavor and a lot of unique design choices that make it a much different experience. My only real complaints are mostly around onboarding (it might take you a bit to figure out the basics, but don't be afraid of reading the wikis - once you figure out how things work the 'flow' is quite good, though maybe a bit frantic for the first few hours). The game is quite deep and there is a ton of content, I'm at 17 hours in now and probably only halfway through the story parts  from what I can tell."
1404,"I love drinking saltwater 
"
1405,uhh
1406,i like it
1407,"Fantastic survival game that is fun to play with your kids and/or friends. 

There is some depth to the crafting that can feel a bit annoying at times, but eventually it starts falling together and crafting most items is no longer a chore. As you become more familiar with the game and the mechanics that make things easier (like the nets to catch stuff in the water) you start to focus on building a sweet raft, collecting animals, and trying to get some of the more advanced gear that requires batteries. 

As with most things, it does begin to feel a little stale after a while. We haven't completed the game as intended yet, and instead have focused on researching new stuff to upgrade our raft. One can only hope they release new expansions and content that can get rid of the stale feeling for another 20-30 hours or more."
1408,"literally could play this game with its story mode over and over again and never get bored of it. overall great concept, would recommend it :))"
1409,get mods it get even funner
1410,"Great multiplayer game, I enjoy traveling around on my raft with friends and exploring.  The storyline was challenging and enjoyable, and I've even been playing it after completing the story because I'm having fun building my raft.  Some of the enemies are annoying as hell, but they keep things interesting at least. Fuck those birds, all of them.
9/10, would buy again."
1411,"The good: Raft is a fun mix of crafting, exploring and survival, and coop support is the cherry on top. I love the art style and the look of all the machinery and equipment. It took a long time to get to the full release, but the wait was worth it.  But as much as I like it, I can't feel but want more.

So let's get into the bad: The shark is cool in the early game, but it serves no purpose in the mid to late game, other than being a slight annoyance. Combat in general does not feel good, some enemies like birds take forever to kill for no real reward. Building up your raft is very fun, but acquiring the wood to do so takes far too long, especially with the upgraded pieces. Several of the explorable locations are looting simulators only partially saved by their unique appearance. Planting vegetables is pretty much pointless. Equipment breaks down a bit too fast for my liking, the final tools not having infinite durability was the ultimate disappointment, there is no downside to that after the story is complete.

I could go on. Raft is far from perfect. But it's still one of the best survival games that you can buy, and perhaps there are limits to what a small indie team can achieve. I just hope they keep working on it, or start working on a sequel, because it leaves me wanting more."

Overall, A good survival game that you can chill and play with your friends!"
1434,good
1435,i like how i can make my raft how ever i want.
1436,boat go  make happy boat stop cry
1437,"i love this game. it has given me many, many, many hours of fun gameplay. i would highly recomend this game for somome looking for a game to get"
1438,the satisfaction of killing a shark makes me feel better about myself
1439,"Highly addicting. Each chapter goes by relatively fast so the game has felt a bit empty since ive been here for each update. However as a new player im sure you will find there is ample content to keep you busy and having fun for a couple hundred hours. The base building is simply awesome. The locations are creative. Im severely bummed they labeled the 3rd chapter as the ""final chapter"" as that implies the game is done and dead now. But its definitely worth the play through"

1449,I think i was on a raft at one point
1450,"A friend of mine forced me to get this game. Though at first i was skeptical of survival games I realized I had mistaken this game for stranded deep, which is in a much worse state. 

I started off quite confused, struggling to even purify water, but within a few hours I was having a blast. I naturally donned the coat of master architect in our team and was in charge of designing our raft layout. Took us longer than I'd care to admit to even realize there's a story in the game but that is when things REALLY took off.

It's not your typical survival type game and I think that's why I loved it. There isn't too much forced combat and the health/hunger/thirst management is very forgiving unlike my previous experiences with survival games.

I especially enjoy how between story missions or islands there's a relaxing sailing portion to chat/mess around with friends, and then eventually you reach an island and go all Christopher Columbus on it. Loved it."
1451,Very fun with friends!
1452,give me dollA

1473,"Fantastic game! Great atmosphere! Terrific story line! My one critique would be that they add more building variations! maybe the ability to connect rafts with friends to build a colony of sorts! I really hope this game continues to get content for years to come, or maybe a Raft 2 in the works! 4.6/5.0 in my opinion. (100+ hours and finished the story mode)"

There is still a lot of glitches but all around its very stable and you will enjoy it for many hours. Now when chapter 3 was realized. I really feel the excitement since there is so much more do discover and I hope the devs will add more to the storyline and more blueprints and more building options. Thanks and I hope this helps."

(plastic, wood, titanium etc.) but none the less, great game and easy to learn with friends.

1528,"The game is honestly a ton of relaxing fun (especially with friends), and I really enjoyed my time with it. That being said, after over 100 hours playing the game I find myself unable to get the last ""secret"" achievement no matter how many times I reload the save file and complete the last island. I've made a couple discussion threads about the issue and only once received a reply, telling me to contact the developers about the bug via a bug report. It has been a couple months since that report was made and I've received no further communication, so I've once again gone through and re-completed the final story island and I still have not received the achievement, leaving this game forever unfinished for me. I am planning on trying again some time in the near future but I do not have much hope.

IMO, this game is 100% worth the money (especially on sale) and is a blast to play with friends, I just have to give this game a negative review because my personal time with it has come to rather negative end."
1529,"Great and engaging coop survival game with cool story locations to discover and explore, but with some unnecessarily tedious achievements and some minor bugs/problems.

All in all recommended, but if you want to 100% it: Good luck with the ensuing boring grind :-)
Example: The ""Survive 365 days"" achievement. We were done with the story and most stuff well before 100 days, at day 150 we simply ran out of things to do and were just floating along on our fully decked out Raft. 365 days seems a little too long-winded, especially since it has to be accumulated on the same savegame.

Additional oddities / gripes:
- The hook does not work for multiplayer clients at the start of the game, they need to drop it once and pick it back up to start working, strange...
- Who the hell designed to bow to be held that way? The bow is horizontal with the arrow not resting on the bow but it's under it?? Wat?
- The giant clam item has literally only 1 mildly useful crafting recipe, then it becomes quite useless.
- Killing screechers is just tedious and time-consuming... 50 of them for the achievement even more so without save-scumming.
- The buff food is so mildly useful with too short durations while being too much of a pain to produce that it becomes completely unnecessary. Also they reset on sleeping, booh!
- Waves during storms are cool, but look extremely ugly on/inside the raft. They also seemed to not calm down anymore at all so we disabled them via ""Motionsickness Mode"", much better that way.
- Story Spoiler: [spoiler] I know it's just a game but the ""reactor"" at the Selene facility doesn't make any sense, lol. From what is mentioned in the story and visible on the site, it seems to be a fission reactor (requires control rods to be shut down, produces high amounts of radioactivity...), yet it also features a torus containment vessel like in a tokamak fusion reactor. Also I'm not sure what to make of this that yet another game uses nuclear reactors as some kind of ""ultra-dangerous"" uncontrollable energy source. No wonder the public keeps being scared of them, when in reality they are among the safest and cleanest energy sources available even when factoring in all the past incidents (although yes, they are costly). [/spoiler]"
1530,This game is very fun and adventurous especially when playing with friends. I very much enjoy playing this game and recommend it to others who are looking to play with their friends.
1531,wery good and fun with friends
1532,"Raft glitched and floated through the island, now lost in the empty void of space and time. Love the concept of the game though."
1533,good game
1534,Very fun and chill experience. Like candy Rust.
1535,"Game is great up until the endgame, highly recommend because playing and building the most insane raft is crazy cool."
1536,good game
1537,Floaty
1538,"In my opinion this is the best story mode-multiplayer survival game thus far. Its simple but challenging, starting from a 2x2 raft and slowly expanding and advancing. The gaming community would love this game but sadly its only on steam as of now. 10/10"
1539,this game is the best
1540,really nice game to play with a pal
1541,"My feelings about this game are really mixed. They're generally positive but I'm marking this review as negative because of my experiences with solo play. I also want to add that my hours are inaccurate as I have at least a couple dozen more hours from solo offline play.

Raft is generally a very chill game to play. I really like the raft building mechanics and the horizontal beams and decorative boards added in 1.0 can really lend itself to some cool raft designs. Playing with friends can be pretty hit or miss - my girlfriend and I get very groggy whenever we play for some reason. No idea why.

Now, the reason this is negative. My main intention with this game was to play the game solo on offline mode. The game is notable for being particularly buggy with offline mode - while the game is still relatively playable, it is up until you reach [spoiler]Tangaroa. You can't interact with any of the puzzles or the elevator at the end[/spoiler]. This is because they cannot function when Steam is in Offline mode for some reason. I owned and played this game while it was in beta and don't recall having any issues with the area while in Offline mode before. While I got around to finishing it when I am able to use Wi-Fi, I really don't like the choice the developers made to ship the game in such a state where Internet is required for solo play. I'd give the developers the benefit of the doubt and say that there's probably some really bad bug that couldn't be easily fixed before shipping out 1.0. 

Still, I wanted to play the game solo in offline mode, and it sucks that you can only do it up to a certain point. I'll change my review when the bug is fixed because otherwise, it's a very fun and enjoyable game.

TL;DR if you intend upon playing the game solo in offline mode, or playing the game using the Steam Deck outside your house, do not buy this game."
1542,hehe sharks
1543,"I have been watching Raft for many years now, ever since alpha.  Its story has deepened and gameplay has expanded since its release.  Raft is a fun and challenging survival game, but can also be zen-like if played in peaceful mode.

One minor nitpick I have is the limitation of creative mode where the rafts cannot move.  I think that the game could benefit from having rafts move in creative mode like they do in survival, being able to encounter islands to test out various designs, without touching on the storyline at all."
1544,"The game is fun until, you realize it's 20 bucks and none of your friends can or are willing to buy it. The game is lonely enough as it is..."
1545,It is fun and good
1546,my pc dosent run this game

1550,"Don't buy if playing on steam deck without internet.

This game is pretty fun i had no problems for the first week playing and then suddenly I keep getting these no connection pop ups which would be fine but if you using a tool at the same time as the pop up the game freezes and doesnt allow any imput meaning you have to close the game and lose progress."

1625,"I enjoyed the story and story telling. I also enjoyed the exploration but there a few minor, repetitive irritations that are generally easy to mitigate. The crafting and building are also quite fun, but I'd say without a couple mods there are a number of upkeep items that get bothersome quickly and there could be some more automation as you progress.

I'd like to stress its overall fun, but my enjoyment went up once I modded away a few things I thought were more nuisance than fun."

1661,"[h1] DISCLAIMER: This is a first impressions review, and NOT a full review [/h1]

Raft is a game developed by Redbeet Interactive and published by Axolot Games

The game offers some nice graphics and a nice aesthetic, although some ugly glitches here and there, it is pleasant all the same

The game does suffer with some repetitiveness at certain areas of the game but a fun game nonetheless

Raft overall, however, is a fun game to play, yet sometimes repetitive and it does get boring if being played for a long time, but is a good open world survival game to play in short bursts!

[h1] RECOMMENDED :) [/h1]

1671,"Raft is a phenomenal game, whether you want to just sit back and relax and fish, or go exploring, or go spelunking or scuba diving, there's an activity for every level of motivation and I could probably spend the entire day playing this game and not get bored because of the sheer variety of things to do and learn, and tremendous sense of progression. Start with 4 basic tiles and by the time you're done you have a massive mobile command center with engines and sails and steering and I won't spoil any more than that!"

1683,EXQUISITE
1684,"its a fun game. if you were to focus on this game hard enough its totally do-able solo. im not that guy, with that said, this is an amazing game with a buddy. i like that the creative mode is available to help get the concept of the game, as well as let you play around with the different materials and learn how to build different things for when you are far enough in the game to obtain certain items. diving for items is a complete game changer. it opens an entire new world of possibilities in this game.

 i also appreciate they took bullet drop into account for the bow as well, im still figuring out the fall damage, ive only been hurt one time jumping from cliffs, this does make certain situations a bit easier. but, that damn antagonist shark......i think thats the biggest reason i have a harder time with this game solo, i wouldnt say that im easily distracted, im actually overly focused and either cant hear the shark attacks, or just dont notice it. maybe the audio track could be louder? i think that may be my only complaint about this game  is the shark attacks are not loud enough to be able to notice, i would also think to improve the dynamics maybe the raft could be jolted, it would be the same concept as running into a rock or any other object like a large log. if there was an impact, there would be a jolt, if there was a 1000 lbs shark latched onto a raft, there would be a jolt ."
1685,good game unless your playing by yourself

1687,"It is a fun survival game
"
1688,"Categorical ratings:
Visuals (7/10) - a little polygonal feeling at times but colourful and interesting (especially with regards to fauna). The islands themselves get a little repetitive as they are based on a limited number of designs but what can we expect from procedurally generated endless oceans?

Audio (9/10) - Is there a lot of audio in Raft? Not really but also that depends on how frequently you set the music tracking to play. In saying that, the soundtrack is definitely gorgeous. I found it to be relaxing and the way it fades in and out at soothing intervals I feel enhances the ""drifting on the ocean"" vibe. The extra sound effects for ""oh s*** I'm drowning"" or assorted engine noises, birds, llamas and whatnot feel the right amount of realistic for this type of game.

Survival (5/10) - Thirst, hunger and oxygen (when diving) are there...not much else really. I feel that the thirst and hunger can sneak up on you sometimes as most methods for maintaining these stats take a small time delay to remedy, whether that's waiting for water to purify or food to cook. It's not overly difficult so dying of thirst or hunger would probably be rare as hell (I didn't die of either in ~180hrs), but it's also not particularly rewarding of diverse food options. A catfish fished up off the side and cooked is almost the same balance of effort/benefit as a fully cooked meal with 4 ingredients. Thirst is easy to keep on top of as long as you remember it, but even if you forget, watermelons and coconuts will bail you out in a pinch. Oxygen, eh, it's a breathing meter, nothing too fancy. I was a little let down by the fact that you can sleep in game to pass time, it depletes your hunger and thirst, and yet it does nothing else. There is practically no reason to sleep beyond...roleplaying I guess? It felt pointless to me.

Crafting (8/10) - Crafting is relatively easy to interface with, you don't need special workbenches or tools for the actual crafting. As you find blueprints, you spend 1 unit of each necessary material at the research table to unlock the blueprint and then (provided you have the materials) you just select them in the crafting menu. Upgraded variants of certain objects are grouped together in the menu so you can clearly see when something is a better/ alternate version of something else. Eh, y'know it's a solid, if simple, crafting system. Not that it bothered me personally but most people seem only to have a gripe with the level of grinding for certain materials as there are no automation mechanics for refining, it all stays manual regardless of your progression. There are some refining mechanics (ores - ingots, explosive goo - powder, seaweed - vine goo etc) but a lot of it is mostly intuitive/stock standard.

Story (7/10) - Is the story super original or intense? No, not really. Does it at least follow some sort of linear narrative that involves several recurring characters? Yes. At each of the story related islands, you learn the story segment for that island through notes scattered about. You complete some puzzles (more on that in a bit), and eventually you follow the breadcrumbs to the relevant clue for the next island. It's not overtly elaborate but the little notes and nuggets of lore do pad out what would essentially just be an ocean explorer game otherwise. The voice overs for the notes aren't necessarily Oscar worthy but, they are far from the worst I've ever heard in a game and at least they're actually voiced, which is a bit of a win in my book.
With the puzzling - you do have to figure out everything for yourself with the puzzles. I enjoy getting to look around and figure things out for myself and yes, there is some guidance in the forms of certain notes/little maps etc but in terms of actually getting things done, your best bet is to REALLY look around as some puzzle components are spelled out really obviously and others aren't so much. I felt it was a good balance. The only part I really did not enjoy was how clunky some of the platforming sections were. Platforming in 1st persons can really suck at times and unfortunately...there's a bit of that here. But all in all, they add a bit of challenge that can be frustrating...it doesn't ruin the puzzling/pathfinding mechanics for me completely, it was just annoying at times.

Combat (4/10) - *disclaimer* I played the bulk of my hours in peaceful mode as I found Bruce's constancy to be more annoying than I would've preferred so take my combat info with a grain of salt. 
Combat is clunky when it occurs. You get a small range of different weapons you can use but most likely, you'll end up relying on kiting anyway just due to the awkwardness. Bruce (the shark that stalks you), will attack your raft every 8(? I think, don't quote me) minutes unless you sufficiently crack him in the head. I found this to be too annoying for my tastes which is why I selected peaceful mode (more on modes in a sec). If you'd still like to experience the more challenging side of the game, Bruce can be prevented from breaking your s*** by armouring your raft (craftable defenses not too far into the game). The bosses on Balboa and Utopia were the only ones that caused me any real grief and by that I mean, I actually had to pay attention to what I was doing, it still only took me 1-2 attempts to pass them. Boss at Varuna was just annoying as hell. All in all, combat doesn't HAVE to play a huge role in most of the game, but there are definitely some points where it's unavoidable (yes, even in peaceful mode for story reasons). 

Modes (10/10) - I rate the modes this highly because of one key feature: You can access 100% of the content even in peaceful mode. I enjoy relaxing games and am actually terrified of the ocean (don't ask me how I survived any of either subnautica, it was not easy lol), so having the option to render 90% of the wildlife harmless (unless provoked in some cases) was important to me. There is a creative mode (no achievements, no survival, just build), peaceful mode (boars, bears, screechers, lurkers, butlerbots and the bosses will attack once engaged but puffers and sharks are harmless, achievements obtainable), easy and hard (both experiences as normal just multipliers vary).

Tl:dr?
Game is great. I found it fun and relaxing. I like that it wasn't aggressively guided or pushy and just left me to my own devices. Building mechanics were a big plus for me, loved the variety of decor/customisation for the raft, as was the peaceful mode option. Fun, goofy creatures you can catch and tame. Absolute plethora of achievements for grind happy completionists.
WELL worth the price.

* I didn't comment on multiplayer mechanics because I don't use them.

1691,Very Addicting.
1692,brilliant game that makes ecofriendliyness
1693,"I love watching streamers play this game and it seemed to be quite popular so my friend and I decided to give it a go. It was fun to start out but quickly started feeling tedious and repetitive. I think a big part of it for us was that the controls feel so unintuitive and gameplay feels a little primitive. For awhile I found myself constantly drinking salt water instead of pouring it into the thing, and I still constantly drop items by mistake.

Keeping up with food/water and the shark eating the raft was fine at first, but it got pretty old pretty quickly, especially when coupled with having to stop frequently and re-make tools that have poor durability and break quickly.

Overall the game just felt really repetitive and we got tired of it quickly. It needs a lot of tuning before I'd recommend it or really want to play again."
1694,h
1695,"pros: shark, raft, spear, potato, seagull, crate.
cons: non, little to no character editing."
1696,"You'd think this game would be right up my alley.  Crafting.  Resource gathering.  Building.  

But here's the problem - the resources are RANDOM.  Sometimes you see barrels or crates floating, those *might* have food.  So you have to sit here, doing your best to gather everything you can with your hook, including every barrel you see, and from time to time you'll get food you can cook and eat.  I still die to hunger on NORMAL.  Seriously, on NORMAL, only activity I'm doing is fishing stuff from the water and occasionally using a paddle to get closer to the barrels.  Too much activity, die to hunger, lose 2/3rds of your inventory.  Hahahahah!  (not)  Refund requested, I *really* wanted to like this game watching everyone on YouTube playing it, it looked like a possible fun time.  As a single player game?  It blows."
1697,"Fun game, on my third play through.  Chasing those achievements"

100% recommend. Note if you are a completionist, it'll keep you plenty busy for a while."
1702,Relaxing (except for Bruce) and feels like there's always more to find.

1704,"Quite honestly, it's a fun game."
1705,Lots of stuff to do! 14 hours in and I've barely scratched the surface of the game!
1706,"It was mostly fun but it was all spoilt in the final act.
The last ""town"" is painfully boring, unimaginative, clunky and even the final boss was a disappointment (no challenge whatsoever). You can really tell that, by the time they got there, the devs didn't want to keep working on the game any more and it's a real shame because the rest was pretty decent."

1710,"Amazing fun game
"
1711,"The clunky controls make this game painful.  The point/click accuracy is horrible.  The gameplay feels like you are playing one of those ""waiter"" simulators where you just try to ""fill customer orders"" as a bar depletes.  This is because the ridiculous rate that thirst and hunger accumulates.  You can't explore the ui, you can't immerse in the game, because its ""bar depletion race"".  I wanted to like the game.  It is visually appealing, but thats about it."
1712,Fantastic Multiplayer experience

1720,got killed by a shark 11/10
1721,"Why does this game sell itself as ""open world"", when it starts you off on a 4x4 meter raft, which moves forward at a fixed pace, and your only means of interacting with the world is trying to play a crane game with rubbish that floats by? 

I tried exploring the first island I came across, only for my raft to leave me behind, effectively ending the game. My building interface shows all the parts of the raft I started on, but evidently you're unable to create a new one if you lose the first. A ""sandbox"" that punishes you for playing in the sand. Without telling you that your game is over.

Also there are no in-game tutorials, as far as I can tell.

Compare to games likes Minecraft or Valheim or Kenshi, which dump you, cold and naked, into a brutal and open world. But at least you can move about and interact with things.

Maybe there's a good game in here, but I work for a living and don't have time to bash my head against a poor presentation with that hope."
1722,is game is very fun to build and surive yet at some parts very hard would recommend
1723,I HAVE TO SAVE WAHT HELL GAME IS THEIS
1724,sherk
1725,cool
1726,"Great game, amazing story, no bugs in sight. Could use some QoL and more decorations.

Would love to see hatch door added. (For ladder access.) Better windows that can open and close, and metal security doors metal walls etc, maybe even doors with pin code. Some kind of MP would be awesome too so that we can interact with other rafts. But I know that's just a pipe dream.

A bit annoying that you can't place ladders adjacent to the walls too, they have to have that gap as they have to be placed in the corners, and you unfortunately don't have 180 degrees support beams.



"
1727,"gaming is much better when played together! I've bought this game for my boyfriend and we both love to play this as a game date, now we invite more of our friends and siblings. I recommend not to watch any gameplay for this game if you play co-op because it would be so funny and chaotic since there is no instructions on what to do and how to"
1728,"Great game overall, really enjoy it. Makes it way more fun with others!"
1729,Its really fun! But do be sure to play with friends! The more the funnier
1730,Bit of simplified fun
1731,few bugs and kinda crap to play alone and never realised you need people on your steam to play with kinda defeats multiplayer in some aspects of what multiplayer is not everyone has friends that play the same games.

It has a story line which progresses you to different areas unlocking you new things to help you survive, gather resources and play around with. Tons of replayability and great with friends! and you can turn off waves so you dont get sick! xD"

И могу сказать что там нет супергероев. Очень разочаровался что нельзя скрафтить бэткрюк. 
Не рекомендую"
1737,"I keep coming back to this game. It's one of those rare games you love playing alone AND with your friends. It can seem grindy at times but it's a peaceful kind of grind because you can tap into the hoarder side of yourself. It gives you a chance to explore, create, organize, and grow. No RAGRETS."

1752,"The game has pretty great survival mechanics and the feeling of progress as your raft slowly improves and expands is very rewarding. It can get boring after a few hours of playtime, since your progress makes a lot of the survival aspects almost completely irrelevant after a while, but even then there will still be base-building to keep you occupied. Overall it's a solid game, especially if you have friends to play it with."
1753,don't get seasick
1754,"A fun game, great for co-op. Definitely focus on reaching the coordinates once you can - I spent too much time in the early game and struggled while building up enough food to carry me through the rest of the game. Better to get the upgrades early so you don't live in struggle city like me."
1755,fun
1756,e
1757,i like dis game it good
1758,"Ruddy Raft

Raft is a pretty intense game with a decent amount of content especially when played with others. It feels alot like subnautica but with a focus on a raft evolving into a boat rather than submarines. Though I would say clearly subnautica is a deeper and superior game this title is still well worth your time for the unique elements it brings to this style of game.

Tralling and exploring the worlds islands and story worlds is intresting and feels varied enough that you always want to continue on and on to find out what lies ahead. Though the game does have some flaws the stingeyness of the resource farming is too high and the rewards often don't hit hard. Some of this causes big hinderence to peoples level of creative expression when building there boat which is alot easier by the end but then its the end. It would be nice to have more freedom in terms of your boat not combat for example. I dont think it would of hurt the game if I loved my boat more on the journey rather than not. Subnautica, Valheim and Vrising all do a much better job for creative players and I really hope this company recognises that. 

So if you beat Subnautica and were disapointed in its sequel give this game a shot theres enough here to justify the price and much creativity to enjoy here. I do hope they work on a sequel to clean up and fill out the game where it is sadly lacking.

1759,shark is mean
1760,Good game. Had fun. Would play again.
1761,This is a great game. I play it with my teenagers so it's a good bonding experience. Very relaxed gameplay once you get the hang of it so there's no stress to it at all. Love the additions in the final chapter also.
1762,epic
1763,fun fun haha yes
1764,Very disappointing. it feels like they added nothing to the game after the alpha release. They started with a survival crafting game had no other ideas and made a different game. Not really surprising from the people who can't even finish their other game that has been in early access for 8 years. Don't waste you money
1765,its fun enough that im keeping it

1773,.
1774,"Great game to play solo or with friends- similar to Minecraft in that once you finish the main game (Utopia Storyline) there is plenty more to do. Achievement hunting, building, etc."
1775,This game is everything you could want in a relaxing game. I love it!!! I have 3 family members that love it too
1776,I play peaceful mode because I'm here more to build than anything. I still enjoy that when you attack the enemies they attack back. It means you can up the difficulty as needed. Its my chill out game and I love it.
1777,nice game.
1778,Very fun game when playing with a friend though the killing achievements are incredibly tedious
1779,So good and fun!
1780,"The raft building and exploration is a lot of fun with friends, as you genuinely feel the urgency to find supplies and survive when you first play the game. However, the story missions towards the end are very disappointing and feel really out of place. The game throws out of place platforming and boss fights with controls that are not suited. I'd recommend following the story up to the 5th Story location then I wouldn't bother playing the rest."

1795,"Very addictive game to play, I would recommend playing with friends, especially if you are a videogame n00b like me. A few notes:

- that's not how sharks behave
- you're gonna go from being scared of wild animals to wanting to go after them just so they can stop annoying you
- you're gonna get to a point where you need X, but find you have 0, so from that point on, your single mission in life becomes to stock up on X, until you get to a point where you have a million X and nowhere to store it, but suddenly have 0 Y. But I ask again, WHY
- once you get your hands on navigational aids, you're gonna want to go to a certain place, only to find that the wind is blowing in the completely opposite direction, and you don't have stuff like an engine yet. When Freddie Mercury sang ""anywhere the wind blows"", that's not what I signed up for. 

Thank you for coming to my RAFT talk."
1796,I am de captain now
1797,super good graphics supreme building and adventure puzzle game
1798,"It's a neat little game. Base building and and works nicely in both single-player and multiplayer.
An early enemy you need to worry more about other than the shark is the bird that drops rocks on you, who could possibly trap you in a saved death-loop whenever you try to respawn lol. Start on easy to get the hang on things and then bump up to more difficult from there and beware of jellies."
1799,"This game is something special, especially if you enjoy playing with 1-3 friends. Crafting, challenges, exploration, puzzles...it's got it all. The attention to detail really shocked me; if you look at an item and go ""I wonder if you can do X with it"" the answer is often yes! My only complaint is that I wish it was longer. The game seems complete, but I'm hopeful for additional updates or dlc for this game. Whether you want to just chill and turn off the status bars or go hard and fight to survive, this game will deliver."

1822,So I finished the game about 2 days ago in about 23.7 hours. I enjoyed the game (well besides some parts). Most people hate the parkour parts on some of the islands but they're nothing extreme and short. One thing that I hate is that UTOPIA (or the ending of the game) is hinted at the whole game. The first lore island has hints and UTOPIA was supposed to be this amazing location yet I would argue that some of the other islands were way better. And after doing all the puzzles and some parkour the ending is just not satisfying. It feels rushed. After the ending there is really nothing to do because besides the lore islands all other islands are the same and there is no reason for you to continue playing the game. I hope there will be a content update so things like the titanium tools will not be useless. The game is not in early access anymore yet it feels unfinished. So I liked the game but the end was meh and there is nothing else to do besides lore islands and just grinding to make your raft a cruise ship 7/10

1855,it has replayability
1856,raft raft raft!! i love putting shark meat on the grill then it gets stolen by my friends
1857,"Raft is a delightful co-op game. It's super chill (when not dying to wild boars or rock dropping birds) and one of my favorite games ever, honestly. My bestie and I love playing together and chatting. I highly, highly recommend this game to everyone! Especially as a solid co-op game."
1858,pretty pogers
1859,very fun (and sometimes fustrating lol) to play with friends but also easy to play on your own good combo between building and survival def recommend
1860,"fuccin boat?
 yes 

    :)"
1861,"I tried to 1v1 the shark 
It didnt work out very well"
1862,Very fun to play with friends if you are looking for a simple time killer.
1863,Good
1864,I like to zip. Hehe zipline fun. Zoom zoom
1865,"FUN WITH FRIENDS
"
1866,i keep accidentally falling off raft and im gonna kms
1867,"One of my favourite co-op survival games to play with my friends, it's got crafting, surviving and exploration and that's all a good survival game needs, it also has a story which is a unique addition to the game and not a thing a lot of other survival games have 9/10 Would kill a shark again"
1868,its fun
1869,"I can eat egg raw, very good. Much enjoy."
1870,yes
1871,plank float on water

1880,yes

1883,yes
1884,"amazing gameplay and story, even without the story the game is great for single player and to play with your friends
"
1885,"this game is phenomenal on a first playthrough but its not replayable at all for me, still an awesome game and better with friends 8/10"
1886,raftt
1887,"i love
"
1888,"Game is fantastic. My wife and I play for several hours whenever we get a chance. It's a great game to play with a friend or a significant other since the game is super chill. No real high stakes, at least as far as I've experienced so far. 10/10"
1889,fun
1890,Pretty fun COOP survival game. Adds platformer and puzzles to the Survival genre. Good to pick up on sale and play with a few friends.
1891,no
1892,"Game has hundreds of hours of replayable content, all of the puzzles, while difficult, are very rewarding to figure out.
There is so much that is fun about this game that I Would save so much time just by listing the bad parts of it.
The screecher enemies, that is it. Everything else, the early game stratigizeing on what to use. The mid game, seeing all of the progress that you have made is so satisfying. and the late game/post game may still be the same formula, but the formula offers infinite things to do.
"
1893,perfect game
1894,minecraft grind
1895,the last island puzzles are quite hard but overall a great game for you and your friends
1896,GOOD GAME
1897,raft :steamhappy:
1898,there is shark
1899,For some reason raft won't play...... but the game is great!
1900,It's a good game and it's got good graphics and it could get better.
1901,w
1902,very nice but it wold be better if you had a good pc
1903,this game is really good and i liek :)
1904,"Cute Design, great survival aspects, 'peaceful' mode for people who want a less stressful experience (i.e. no enemies), interesting storyline (haven't finished it yet) but without time pressure - I love it!"
1905,Best game for a mind wonderer and just want to sit down a play game

1910,very good i am scared of the water because of shark
1911,One of the most relaxing and fun games I've played in a long time. Occasionally there are clipping issues but overall a great game and highly recommend it.
1912,"sharmk, very good"
1913,"Very good game.
Good graphics (dont need a good pc to run, low/average end pc will be fine.)
Good audio
Any age range 
The newly added things are really cool. The game has gone into a lot more detail to say the least. This being with the newly added things being in the game, the game has just got more advanced."
1914,This game is so fun. Its so hooking and a great survival game! I named the shark anthony :)
1915,"Really fun game, nice to play both with people and alone. Really like the story and with the renovation update it got more fun to make the raft more homie"
1916,Better than Minecraft
1917,One of the best survival games I have ever played. Also the new content is epic.
1918,"[h1][b]Pros[/b][/h1]
+ Physics.

[h1][b]Cons[/b][/h1]
- Hunger and thirst drains extremely fast, even with end-game food and drink bonuses, which is frustrating.
- All features are as deep as a puddle, making the game very tedious and boring.
- No procedural generated islands, you see the same ones over and over.
- Recipes that require to be found to be unlocked, can easily be found in a matter of hours.
- The rest of the recipes are obtained via the story, which makes it pointless being there is no reason to play after you beat the game.

[i]Wasn't a fan of this game at all. It's more of a exploration and puzzle game than a survival one. In which case, I'd recommend Sea of Thieves instead. As for the survival aspects, this is potentially the worst I've ever played. Any survival game is better.[/i]"
1919,"i just abandoned my raft, neat"

1925,thank!
1926,yes
1927,"I reccomend this game because it is fun to play for it's exploring ways, how you need to gather your stuff to build up the raft and so on. When you play with frineds it is so much more fun and you can get the better expirience to live yourself in the game I would say. I love how you can gather characters by following the story and that you do not need to follow the story at all, even though I would recommend to follow the story for the best expirience."
1928,uwu
1929,It was an amazing journey!
1930,"I give this game a thumb down for the lack of the Pause button in the single player mode.. In Starve together (single player mode) and in City Skylines, you can pause those games at any moment to take care of other things in life: family interaction, deliveries, trying to eat while playing etc.

Raft simply does not have a pause button, so you end up Saving a game, Exiting the a game to the main menu and then Load the game, which takes too much time for someone like me to handle.. A problem that could have been solved with a simple Pause button..

I am sure that Raft is a good game, there is a lot of positive reviews to the game from players who dedicate their full attention to the game; however I bought this game years ago, and I cannot bring myself to play the game because of the no pause button.. To me, the majority of my time playing this game is spent on staring at the load screen..

I do not recommend Raft because of the lack of the Pause button. I do not recommend it to people who multitask and have a life with constant interruptions.."
1931,"VERZ GOOD
"
1932,ha ha funny raft float
1933,Play also i stream watch it is roxymoreon
1934,"I bought this game in early access, when there was only first radio tower and the game was over. And it still was fun, even with that limited playtime. I finished the game with a friend recently, after the 1.0 update. I can say, it expanded a lot. Engines, steering wheel, biofuel, electricity, animal taming. It was all great fun. Strongly recommend. I wish it was a bit longer story-wise, so I could have time to build more high-tier stuff from titanium ore. 9/10, but better play with a friend"
1935,it is nice and good
1936,the best
1937,Pretty good liked it better than i thought
1938,Recommend to anyone that likes survival games. Fun so far.
1939,"No guidance at all on how to play, and these eagles drop rocks on you with sniper precision, and your character is hungrier than a diabetic. Game sucks."

1947,"This game is a lot of fun! Some things take some working out (especially in the beginning when you first get started) but once you get the hang of it...it's smooth sailing - pun intended! It can be a little repetitive and some of the islands offer much of the same in terms of gameplay but it definitely rewards you as you inch along.

My husband and I play this co-op and unlike a lot of other co-op games which don't seem to have enough tasks to keep all players engaged; there is so much for each of us to do. If you don't enjoy gathering resources or fishing - no problem - settle for building or hunting instead. If you enjoy survival games this one is for you. It makes grinding very rewarding. We're almost 12 hours in and we've barely scratched the surface. Sail away, sail away...sail away."

1968,"A truly unique spin on the survival and co-op genres. 

Playing with a friend or three transforms the game into a relaxing time interspersed with frantic moments and puzzles. 

Very enjoyable and recommended."
1969,"Very nice survival game, for sure one of the better ones I played. I like most of the story islands, but some of the jump&run puzzles are annoying. You can build a very nice and cozy Raft, if you get all of the blueprint. The most important blueprint is the stringlights ofc, I built the most romantic Raft ever with them Buy the game and buy your own romantic Love Shack with stringlights 8/10. Also: I never ate THAT much food in my entire life in a video game.

I downloaded a survival game, with is relaxing, you gather some materials, build your raft... and out of the sudden I got some puzzles... some of them requires you to use your brain - and they are kind of OK - still... not something I'd expect from peaceful survival game, but OK... next I got some tasks require dexterity like running, jumping over elements in 3D .. what the hell? is survival type of game to boring that one needed to find and incorporate other genres and add some things to the game which are totally not related?? Who thought that if I enjoy sailing on a raft and gather materials to expand my raft, out of the sudden in last island I'd love to jump and squat to avoid obstacles ?!"

2045,hgdfgh
2046,It's gud.
2047,i love this game
2048,"Raft is a bit of a mixed bag. As a lover of survival games, I enjoyed the core gameplay loop. The story was interesting too, though a little hard to follow due to it's fragmented nature. By the time I saw a name again I'd forgotten who that character was. (Except for Detto, and that was because he started his logs uniquely)

However: the boss fights are simply not fun. This game is not really built for combat, and it shows. There are times the game drags you into a shot that you have no way of avoiding. I also feel the 2/3 penalty for normal is way too steep. 1/3 would be better in my opinion. I'd suggest it be optional but I do believe there is an option for that. In the end: I ended up save scumming on the final island a ton, compared to never earlier. The fights just aren't fun for me. And it takes forever as a solo player to gather the gear up again. 

So if you play this game solo, either play on easy or make backups of your files. Because this game has more punishing deaths than minecraft. And in minecraft you lose all your inventory. But in Raft: resources are a lot more time consuming to gather. 

TLDR: The core gameplay is calming, story is alright, but the 'bosses' get steadily more painful the further into the story you get."

2084,"Fun game to play with friends, the story is amazing and has some lore to it. The game got a new boost of story, mechanics and gameplay with chapter 3's release. Great game."
2085,"Has ok singleplayer but the multiplayer is where its at. Get the boys on Raft and you got yourself at least 3 hours of good fun and games. 

Long Live the S.S. Sega Playstation"
2086,stuck on a raft with a hook to get resources but then a dumb ass shark bites your raft until part of it breaks off and you want to kill it so badly but you need more resources to get a harpoon to kill it
2087,I love how I can be creative
2088,"played this game with one of my best friends. we had a great time and played this non-stop for 3 days straight, and me and him had the funnest/funniest time of our live playing this game. we have beat the game already, but will for sure redo all of our progress and start again, and have fun while doing that as well. thanks for making such a fun game."
2089,it is fun with a friend
2090,Very good but i do not play it
2091,good game
2092,Fun game to play co-op.
2093,game boat simulator and the life simulator ansd
2094,I love how even though I am playing this game on a laptop and not on some decked out pc I ca still appreciate the graphics without my laptop exploding! Lovely game to play by yourself or with friends
2095,"Still figuring it out, which is common with survival games. I'd appreciate more detailed graphics and would love, love, love controller support. Even with motion sickness mode on, I keep getting motion sick. Spear combat is super frustrating.

But, even for all its faults, I'm enjoying playing this with a friend. Easy is a little too easy, but Normal was a little too hard. Maybe someday we'll graduate. It's a cool concept and totally enjoyable."
2096,I just like the game

2099,"Pretty fun game! I have spent so much time on this game, so far. It just keeps going and going. There is so much water! It also brought to light how much trash is in the ocean, but thats a topic for another day. Definitely worth the purchase, and if you can play with friends, it only makes it that much better! Stop reading reviews, and just buy the dang thing already!"

I particularly enjoy the fact that there is a story-esque quest line in the game, giving you something to do other than farm wood to make chests to store all your wood in."
2149,Super fun and even better with friends!
2150,I really like building my own boats and living on them. Really cool progression and survival tactics.
2151,"Friends of mine made me get it, and no regrets so far. super fun to play solo or with mates, and there are pretty decent amount of mods around for it, including firearms :D 
I just wish the questline would be longer, and there would be more building items. a submarine option would be cool as hell. as far as i see, this game has alot of unused potential.
But even as it is, i really like it :)"

2155,"I've clocked almost 10 hours in this game and can safely say that I have thoroughly enjoyed it. I've only experienced one issue throughout my 10 hours, and this was a bugged storage crate. A quick save and reboot resolved that. 

I game with multiple friends when playing this game. All of us are always excited to hop into this world each time we play. It pulls from similar survival/crafting games such as The Forest and Sea of Thieves. I enjoy building a raft, crafting and researching items, and foraging and fishing to keep my character alive. 

Since this is my first time playing this game, we decided to play on easy mode to allow everyone to enjoy themselves and not take things too seriously. We're a goofy bunch of gamers who enjoy the quality time we spend gaming together without getting too serious. So this game hit the nail on the head for all of us! 

I'm excited to continue my Raft adventure and will update this review if I happen upon anything else that needs reporting."
2156,"I really like this game,100% would recommend, the visuals, game play is nice"
2157,the game is good but rite now in 2022 my game crashis
2158,"Fun multiplayer experience, its good for about 30hrs of fun. Some minor bugs but nothing major."
2159,"This is really good! Its funny and a great survival game. Me and my friends love playing this game because of the adventure and difficulties. Sure its hard, buts its really rewarding!"
2160,"This is an awesome, peaceful game with a less peaceful shark. :)"
2161,"Let's sail away to the post apocalyptic water world... Equip your hook and gather as much garbage as you could, then build your Raft and fortify it! And yeah The Shark... he's ugly and annoying lol

Pro:
- The lore of this game is kinda interesting
- I love the graphic style
- Really fun to play with friends

Cons:
- The shark! I hate it very much lol
- The connection can suddenly be down somehow...

Final Score: 4/5"
2162,pretty good fun game but i called the shark Dolores but their real name is bruce and thats my grampa's name not a shark name and also why did you add females to the game

2177,"Fun game, saw the Achievement Hunters playing it and it was a blast."
2178,"Raft is so close to being great- But it falls far short of improving anything about the genre it fits itself in, and introduces mechanics actively worse than most of its competitors.

Simple tweaks to durability, construction costs, or recipes would go a long way towards making the game simply put, radically better. Breaking a ship part does NOT refund its cost- meaning every mistake in placement of a board will add up extremely fast. Accidentally breaking a part that holds up other parts also breaks those without any chance of a recoup of loss either, meaning simple construction projects like knocking out a lower wall will obliterate a massive chunk of your entire raft, including EXTREMELY expensive equipment you had to scrounge for hours to build. This lack of recouped losses, for some reason, also includes RETEXTURING ship parts- if you want to swap out your raft's ramshackle aesthetic for the very nice looking thick boards or the pretty overgrown vines, you're going to have to boot the ENTIRE cost of building your raft from scratch to do so.

The game also has a massive focus on combat without putting a lick of effort into actually trying to make that combat fun. None of the weapons are fun to use, nor seem to hit particularly accurately (specifically the melee weapons), and have basically zero reach. If an enemy isnt literally an inch from your camera, you're probably not going to hit it. Arrows seem to curve downwards inexorably from gravity at almost a rate of a foot per meter, making them operate effectively more in the range that the melee weapons ought to have been, and making them essentially the only viable weapon throughout the entire game's runtime. Almost every enemy is capable of easily murdering you with little effort, but most encountes boil down to simply noticing them before they notice you and take a quarter of your health bar away and then abusing the fact that they dont move while doing an attack animation (which can help you out against every single eenemy up to and including the last boss). Simply put, the combat just isn't fun, in any meaningful metric, and it actively brings down the overall enjoyment of the game.

Most upgrades to you, your raft, or your supplies are temporary at best and will always, always inevitably need to be replenished. You cant replace the battery in your metal detector, or put more oxygen in your oxygen tank after its spent- these things just randomly and automatically combust the second they reach zero percent spent, and have zero ways to repair.  And this applies to every single aspect of the game, which a vast multitude of objects that should be permanent upgrades to either you or your characters simply being not even worth bothering with because they'll all break within the next 10 minutes of playing, basically regardless of whatever it is you do, from flippers to weapons to ziplines, there's a large number of mechanics that seem fun on paper but cost a significant and horrific drain on your resources to actually attempt to have fun with past the initial one you build that eventually, like everything else, breaks."
2179,Just such a fun game that feels new every time you jump into a session.
2180,"Really solid game with a lot of potential. Obviously, more fun with friends."
2181,very cool
2182,"This game is just awesome ! 

The Difficulty has to do with your play style and priorities. 
- Focus on combat ? It will be difficult at first 
- Focus on Gathering ? The game becomes a breeze fast
- Focus on building your raft ? The ocean becomes your best friend. 

While playing the game you slowly become attached to your character and raft. 
This is kind of strange because you are "" Alone "" in the world, your best friend 
tries to eat you the whole time... [ The shark ] But you slowly make a deep 
connection to the world. 

Exploration feels fresh and rewarding, sure many islands repeat on the loop but 
if you advance the story new islands are unlocked, and island types too.  When this 
gets stale to some after a while the game makes it feel fresh with a treasure hunt.

The building part of the game is great fun too, you can go all minimalistic and build 
something beautiful and homely. Or you can go industrial large and usefull while trying 
to keep the raft feel alive on a grander scale. 

Enjoy the game guys, it's really fun.

2185,"Too many beginner's traps at the start of the game. The game supposedly has had an extensive Early Access, so those beginner's traps must be intentional.

The game doesn't let you build a new raft if existing one drifts off, which is near-guaranteed when you first start the game. So most new players will be stranded and soft-locked within the first few minutes.

You can be short of specific resources right at the start due to RNG, so you can't make even the bare essentials before you die from thirst or starvation. 

Apparently your character has the metabolism of The Flash in normal difficulty, because she has to consume food every minute.

Lots of mechanical clunkiness, like useless raw materials getting into use bar, or objects not gatherable unless they are submerged, or not being able to pluck leaves from trees, etc.

Lots of intentional frustrations piling up like fast-respawning Sharks, Seagulls, and homing birds that drop rocks."

2204,"The new additions are interesting, although it looks like I'll have to play through everything again to get the new player character skins (I would have settled for different clothing items to differentiate players, but that's fun). It's a nice survival game to play with others and the story gives you somewhere to go beyond tricking out your raft :) It's rougher on folks who aren't great with in-game mobility (like myself) in that you'll need more food and water to get through the same content, but it's plenty doable."

2210,"“Jesse! We have to break bad.” Walter says and he turns to his twink, omega friend with his luscious blond hair and his wonderfully tight pink suit. “Walter, why, walter?” Jesse asks with tears in his eyes as he sticks out his arm to touch his sparkly headed friend. 
“We need money, I can't continue funding your porn addiction on my salary being a high school science teacher!”
“Oh”
Jesse steps back, spins exactly 360 degrees and then says “okay let's go make some meth”
Walter and Jesse skip away, holding hands on their way to the alpha's RV that they will soon convert into their Super Secret Meth Lab™. Walter uses his generation 8 ipad to go onto amazon (he has a premium account) and buy all of the meth ingredients with one day delivery and free shipping. Little does he know, in doing so, he got added to the DEA watchlist. When they wake up from their sleepover at his house the next morning, wrapped in each other's arms, the meth supplies are already at the door. Jesse wanted to get someone to help with their meth empire, but the only person that came to his mind was his childhood friend Gus Fring, who had cut off ties with him completely after Jesse came out to him as gay. 
Today is the day they begin their meth-y endeavors. They move all of the supplies into the RV and put on their spotify collaborative playlist called BFFS 4EVR and they commence their work while hitting the gritty to california gurls by Katy Perry. 
“Walter, are you sure we should do this?” Jesse asks pensively
“Hmm did someone say something? Must've been the wind” Walter says to himself, ignoring Jesse
“Sorry, Sorry. Mr. White, are you sure we should do this” he repeats, now using the roleplay name Walter insisted on before stepping into the van.
“Yes we should Jesse, or do you never wanna see any large, girthy men ever again?”
Jesse looks at his feet, ashamed as Walter grins at his success. 
Walter starts mixing all the meth ingredients together as Jesse goes onto facebook marketplace, making an ad for their meth so they can sell it once it is created. There is a loud POOF as Walter added the magic secret ingredient to make the meth. “There!” He exclaimed, proudly, “the meth is now complete.” 
“Perfect!” Jesse says, “We already have 69 people looking to buy some”
“Nice” Walter says, raising his eyebrows. Funny number, he exclaimed under his breath. They decide that they want to have another sleepover, both of them finding it hard to sleep without being wrapped in the warm embrace of the other. They construct an elaborate dance to woo Walter's odd smelling roommate, Hector Salamanca, into letting Jesse stay over another night. The dance is a success and Hector rings his bell in approval.
“You really need to move out already” Jesse sighs, “I'm running out of dance moves to do. I wish we could live together all by ourselves and have sleepovers every night.”
“I do too Jesse, but this is how it is for now. Maybe we will make enough money selling meth to buy you some porn and  a new house for the both of us.”
“Wow that would be amazing, walty” Jesse wiggles in excitement where he stands, his eyes sparkling. 
“But for now- we should go to bed, we have a long day of selling meth tomorrow and I know you need your beauty sleep or else your tummy hurt :(“
As Walter tucks Jesse into bed, extra tight around his legs how he likes it, he makes the split second decision to lean in and give Jesse a little kiss on his forehead. “Goodnight my silly goose.” But Jesse does not respond as Walter lays down beside him, seeming already asleep.
—
Jesse is everything but asleep. His heart is racing as he lays incredibly still next to his best friend. Only his best friend. That's all they will ever be. Of course, Why would Jesse want anything different? He isn't sure why his mind is running with thoughts of the forehead kiss. It's probably because he hasn't had a moment of affection in a long time. That must be why he keeps giggling like a schoolgirl. No other reason. He only feels platonic feelings for his friend. His straight friend, he reminds himself. Even if he were to fall for him —which would never happen, obviously— then there wouldn't be any possible chance that they would end up getting together. Not that it matters, because Jesse definitely does not have a crush. The only reason the scent of the alpha is comforting is because they are friends, he ignores how his instincts are going wild laying next to the other man. He does eventually end up falling asleep and he dreams of him and Walter, and all their moments together.

Chapter two: The methaning 
The next morning they awoke with limbs tangled together and hot breath on each other's faces. Today was the day the men were going to sell their meth. The alpha turns to Jesse as he opens his phone to check who their first customer is, Tuco Salamanca, hmm, they better not tell Walter's roommate about this one. The gang piled into the RV to go to their meth meetup spot, albuquirky, new mexico. Since they were born and raised proud australiens, it would be a bit of a drive. Walter wonders why the omega would decide somewhere so far away. “I thought it would be silly.” Jesse remarks once the older one decided to ask. 
“Fair enough, let's hit the road!” Walter exclaims, bringing his hand down to slap the concrete and giggling at his hilarious little joke. The omega brings a hand up to cover the growing blush on his face, he is completely and utterly enamored with his best friend and it is getting harder to deny with every passing second.
—
The shiny headed man had taken the first driving shift, since he lost rock paper scissors after Jesse completely bamboozled him by choosing gun instead of the three traditional options. He could have argued that this was unfair but he would let the other man get away with anything. It has always been like this. Walter has always felt so incredibly fond of Jesse no matter what he was doing. Now as he looks over to his right he sees the man adorably curled up and snoring away in the passenger seat. Walter leans over a bit to caress Jesse’s leg, just because he can. The shorter man hums in his contentment through his dreamy state and cuddles up more with his lightning mcqueen blanket. 

After hours and hours of driving through the ocean they finally arrived at their destination. The RV rose out of the sea and they pulled up to park right next to where all the buyers were waiting for their meth. Everyone was patiently sitting criss-cross applesauce in the middle of the desert, money out and prepared to buy drugs, with Tuco sitting nearest to where the RV pulled up, along with Todd Alquist, Mike Erhmantraut and Hank Shrader. The deals went well and Walter finally got use of the fast food scanny thingy he got on a whim years ago after seeing an ad for it with a hot man. He was really drunk and thought that he was purchasing the man, but at least he can use this wonderfully overpriced scanner.
—
It was Jesse’s turn to drive now and he and the alpha had decided to find a motel to rest in to be more efficient with the drug deals. The shorter, twinkier, man hasn’t experienced any coherent thoughts since waking up next to his friend that morning. He found himself zoning out while driving and missing things the other was saying to him. The only building they could find was filled with people, but the two friends decided it wouldn’t hurt to see if there were any rooms left over. Walter was practically falling asleep as he was clinging to the omega, bringing his nose up to the other’s gland to breathe in the comforting scent since Jesse was too busy to remember to put on his scent patch that day. Jesse walks up to the counter, arm around his friend’s waist to steady himself as he prepares to ask the worker about any empty rooms. Since he has never had good social skills, he was starting to get nervous, who knew being a drug dealer would involve so much conversation. There didn’t seem to be anyone at the front desk but on the wall b"

Never found fresh water on the mounds of dirt they call an Island and the hunger/thirst timers are overly aggressive.  Sharks go right to you and kill you over and over for no reason.  

I will have more fun sitting in a kiddie pool repeatedly punching my testicles than enjoy this game."

2244,"Played single player. Looks and plays great at first, but gets boring and repetitive later on. Not much to do, with mediocre story at best."
2245,"I got this game cause it looked like something I could delve into with friends and family and attempt to survive the harsh seas while drifting to and fro on my raft while exploring the unknown wonders of the ocean and islands before me in my travels. I wanted to love this game, I really did. I've done survival games in the past so I knew what I was getting myself into, but this is a whole new mix of mess. The amount of time you are drifting on the very wide, bleak ocean feels like an eternity. Which gets old very fast. There just isn't enough to see. Occasionally you might see some sea turtles, or manta rays maybe even some dolphins. But those moments are fleeting and few. I wish there was more exploration underwater as well as islands with purpose. All the islands I've visited had flowers, for paint, and an occasional fruit to eat and a tree or two to chop down for wood and leafs. It would be nice if each island felt unique, had some sort of reason you'd be curious and actually want to visit. A landmark of interest, or a cool treasure to find, but they did not. Some deserted ships or other boats you could find out at sea for exploration would be cool. Instead you find some makeshift raft with a loot box on it. Would be cool to be able to add it to your raft, like an upgrade, or offer a piece of clothing or something. The character choices are also very forgettable, I feel a simple create your own character system would of worked perfect for this, and finding other npc's could unlock features or clothing options instead of adding more forgettable characters to the game. A variety in sharks would be cool too. Especially since you can kill it, and more of the same just keeps coming at you, it gets very repetitive and very boring fairly fast. This could use some DLC to add more life into this game. Feel it would work better as a cellphone game then one you'd want to constantly revisit to simply see more of the same thing, over and over again. I'm kinda surprised this is the final chapter and isnt still in early access. Just feels like it stopped short of something great. Lets hope the Dev's add more content in the furture with DLC packs. Pirate costumes, Sunken ships, more sea life, octopus/kraken attacking the raft, Hammer Head sharks.... something. I have not tried creative mode at the point of this review, so I can not comment on that feature, just main game and co-op."
2246,.
2247,good game
2248,nice
2249,"Great game, recommend playing co-op/multiplayer/with friends"
2250,GOOD
2251,"Great game over all. This comment wont be very helful because I cant put my finger on why like it so all your going to get is, great game!"
2252,"i can name llamas ""wife"" and force them to live with me"
2253,"There are probably a good number of people out there who will enjoy this game, unfortunately I am not one of them. I found the constant shark, and then bird, attacks frustrating, and the grinding of 'stuff' got boring pretty quickly particularly when the bird and shark attacks meant you lost stuff upon death. Not for me."
2254,I think this is a chill survival game and is also very fun to play with friends
2255,"good

2256,"you're looking for a review on this game you've come to the wrong place, but if you're looking for an outstanding pie recipe you've come to the right place.

Ingredients:

1. 6 tablespoons unsalted butter
2. 1/2 cup white sugar
3. 1/2 cup brown sugar
4. 1/4 cup water
5. 1/4 teaspoon cinnamon
6. 1 pinch salt
7. 5 apples - peeled, cored and sliced
8. 1 pastry for double-crust pie

Directions:

1. Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C).
2. Combine butter, white sugar, brown sugar, water, cinnamon, and salt in a saucepan over medium heat. Bring to a boil, remove from heat and set aside.
3. Roll out half the pastry to fit a 9-inch pie plate. Place bottom crust in pie plate; pour in apple slices.
4. Roll out top crust into a 10-inch circle. Cut into 8 (1-inch) wide strips with a sharp paring knife or pastry wheel. Weave the pastry strips, one at a time, into a lattice pattern. Fold the ends of the lattice strips under the edge of the bottom crust and crimp to seal.
5. Pour butter-sugar mixture over top of pie, coating the lattice, and allowing any remaining sauce to drizzle through the crust.
6. Bake in the preheated oven for 15 minutes. Reduce heat to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C), and bake until the crust is golden brown, the caramel on the top crust is set, and the apple filling is bubbling, 35 to 40 more minutes. Allow to cool completely before slicing."

2259,"Uh you build a raft and set sea. well your stranded in the sea in the first place
this game consists of bruce an annoying btch who i deeply hate and a certain snowman named olaf
watch frozen the movie to understand"
2260,"good story, all the adventure we can do is so cool, all the anti logic things also"
2261,good :)
2262,good game came a long way from the start
2263,raft
2264,"Chill game, very peaceful, yet exiting, Many customization options for the raft with decorative objects and painting. Story is overly dramatic, which is funny, mainly the voiceacting, but i don't care, i play this game for it's survival game aspect, storyline is just a bonus."
2265,fun game
2266,"This game is grindy i have to admit but you kinda get what you signed up for. the problem i have is with the save system say you want to save before running into a giant bear or the rhino shark. if you die the world back you just made, when you load into it it it will kill you anyways, and on normal this means you lose 2/3 of your stuff even if you save before the fight. this issue really needs to get fixxed because it punishes you to much. I have completed the game on easy, but wanted to try normal, and saving before a fight should put me back to before the fight not losing my items all over again.

if any developer sees this please take my advice."
2267,Love to play casually in peaceful mode
2268,This game is very fun. I enjoy playing this game everyday. If you like building new homes and discovering new places then this game is the game for you.

2270,loving the game
2271,"This is a grate game and i would recommend it to others.
Even though it starts off slow its still worth the money and definitely ramps up the pace after a bit."
2272,"This game is oddly addicting, fun, and just enough of a challenge."
2273,Very fun one of the only games like it. (forgot subnatica :( )
2274,Uah
2275,Good game.
2276,i just get to bored i just think i wasted my money
2277,"how to play
1. Build raft
1.5. Stab shark
2. Build more raft
Repeat"
2278,In my opinion
2279,"It is Sabnautica without a story and magnificent underwater life, so, without killer features. One main good point - is building the raft itself. But even this process is not as fun as it can be. Expanding your raft pretty long process that minimizes the fun of the development. Limited islands are boring and made only for the grind. Story useless spiced up with the boring and senseless game flow like ""find the hummer to break the lock"", why do I need exactly that hummer? What is wrong with any random rock that is big enough? The only purpose of the story is not to gain fun but only to obtain new blueprints for a raft. And after the raft had been built came nothing. No goal, no additional exploration. The last good point - is that this game is completed but it may be more interesting if it has more activities except for building rafts and grinding."
2280,"Love this game, truly an inspiration for many survival crafting games to come in the future."
2281,its a good game

2290,"survival mode is pretty fun depending on what mode you pick, with friends its alot more fun but comes with alot of pros and cons, for example more rescource gathering but more food to get. and creative is epic B)"
2291,"I like this game a lot. Very fun to play both solo and co-op. Highly recommend if you enjoy other building/survival/crafting games. Very low-stakes and zen gameplay loop on easiest difficulty. Feels like a fair challenge on higher difficulties. If playing co-op, there's plenty to do for everyone: raft upkeep, fishing, cooking, decorating, gathering, (pretty basic) combat. Some of the story islands have some fun puzzles, but some can be a bit tedious and annoying. I can be a completionist, so there's plenty for me to do trying to get all the collectibles/achievements. Plus you can have pets!(and kill them!) I'm glad they fixed some of the seagull bugs, and really like a lot of the automation that was added in the final chapter update. One of my favorite games in the past few years for sure, and if you get bored of one raft it's always enjoyable to start another and see how creative you can get with the build!"
2292,need woodz
2293,"Fun to play with friends, playing alone is good if you just want to have a relaxing game to play"
2294,"I bought raft to play with my daughter and she got overwhelmed by the initial learning curve, so I refunded it.

Later, I bought it to play with my wife and she got overwhelmed with the initial learning curve, so she refunded it.

Since I was past the refund point, I decided to give it a try alone. After I got past the first hour I loved it. I found myself looking forward to coming home from work to play some more. I really liked being able to decide at any point whether to progress the story or just ignore it for a while to spend more time gathering resources and building up my raft. The gradual progression of new blueprints also had a good flow to it through the whole game. I ended up getting tired of the game just shortly before the last story island, but I was still enjoying it enough to finish it and it is rare that the length of a game is so close to my enjoyment span of the game. Of course I was free to play on after finishing the story, but I was good and satisfied with my whole experience. Highly recommended, just read some guides and push through the first hour or so."
2295,"This game is great, it can be a challenging survival game or a calm, relaxing trip through a strange world. The concept is great, and while I do not think the story is that good, I still love the game and the quality of life that the full game brought. If you are bored and wanna find a game to play to relax, I highly recomend this game."
2296,d
2297,nice game
2298,This game is really fun I can beat it casually and have lost of fun with the story.
2299,It's a fun relaxed survival/crafter with friends. I'm not a fan of most of the mission outposts though and playing the game single player would not be a fun experience.

2308,"Spent 3 hours playing with my bestie - had LOADS of fun! Couldn't figure everything out at first, so we have been playing on the peaceful mode until we are officially ready to play for realsies on a normal mode. Definitely worth at least one play through to decide how you feel about it!"
2309,Only three hours into the game and although my laptop was getting spicy on my lab this game is relaxing!

2315,fun game
2316,"After finishing the game, and almost 50 hours as of writing this, I can assure you that Raft is a game you will enjoy. There is a GREAT amount of story that I enjoyed, and if you like multiplayer games that can also be played solo, you will enjoy the story.

We will be splitting this review into 2 different areas.
-Exploration
-Story

[h1] Exploration [/h1]

There is a great amount of areas you can explore, such as small islands and big islands. Small islands introduce you to resources you will need to survive. Big islands have a lot of content I won't share as it could be spoilers for the game. There are coral reefs at both islands that you can get materials using the hook in your inventory. These are essential for continuing on in the game. There are also occasional small abandoned rafts you can come across on your journey. Be aware, they will sink after a while so be sure to grab everything there, and then get back to your raft.

[h1] Story [/h1]

The story in Raft is very fun. You might have not even known this game had story before you saw this review. Well let me tell you, it is a great experience. Especially as the final story part was released a few months ago, it is a perfect time to enjoy the most content you can. To get to the islands, you need a receiver and antennas. You can press T to see all the codes you can input into the machine. Make sure that you are prepared before you step foot on an island, as these islands can include some seriously difficult enemies. At these islands, there are blueprints for items you can make. This will make killing enemies easier in the long run. You will find notes that are essential for the story line, and will make you understand the backstory of the game.

Wait, you finished the game? What to do next? INSTALL MODS. After you finish the game, start a new world and play with mods. You will be impressed what the raft community can do. There's even a Raft VR mod in the works right now. Look up Raft Mod Loader on Google and you will be CRUSHED by the sheer amount of mods on the website. It is very easy to setup, do it.

If this enticed you to purchase Raft, please like or even award to help this review help even more people."
2317,Fun game! I imagine I'll get lots more play time out of this.
2318,it good

2328,"I was hoping for a very casual game. This game is difficult on the Easy mode. I wish I could return it, but I have past the 2 hour limit. There is a learning curve and it is not a casual gaming experience. I wanted to like the came but I can not. I have wasted $20. If you are looking for a casual, not pay 100% attention to, I would look else where.
"
2329,this game is very chill
2330,BOAT BOAT BOAT BOAT RAFT MEN GO DISTANCE GO BOAT AND GROW PLANTS GO BOAT DISTANCE
2331,gud
2332,"It has the worst achievements I've ever seen. Most of them are really excessively tedious, but there's one that's atrocious. You have to find a randomly generated small island that has a 2% chance of appearing- twice. (Nothing to do with a story, just exploration.) The fact that this has nothing to do with a player's skill or ability offends me. There is literally nothing you can do- it will be a matter of luck, re-rolled, EVERY time a small island generates on the horizon. We played for hours, and my friends are STILL playing- and they haven't even found one of these islands. 

I appreciated that I could play with my friends, and that it was fun (at first). If you don't care about achievements at all, this game is good."
2333,graphics suck.
2334,"the game is so much fun to play alone or with friends, you have many options to be creative and there are ways to deter the shark, not really great if you have severe thelassophobia but it's still amazing and a great game for couples to help each other out and strengthen their bonds
"
2335,"Great game, add official controller support please for us steam deck users ;)

2357,fun and relaxing to de-stress after a bad or long day at work or school. I love coming home and playing this because the stress just seems to melt away. its nice to play alone or with friends.
2358,very fun and exciting
2359,"Great all-around game, though it did take several years for it to get good. Replayable, easy to pick-up, and enjoyable, except on hard difficulty. Hard will not let you respawn and requires a friend to join your world to save you if you die. There is some mod support and creative mode is surprisingly fun. This is a must have for anyone who enjoys cooperative games, building, survival, or post-apocalyptic story games."
2360,"I'm playing it with friends but I'm having fun. It's still a little slow in terms of progress, especially getting navigation up and running feels like a lot of hurdles, but just roaming the sea, building, bumping into islands and dying to bomber birds is fun.
I lied, I hate the birds."

2362,This Game Is Soooo Fun!!!
2363,This Game Is Very Good
2364,Cant play with friend. Wont connect to host.
2365,"I like raft. I will continue to play raft. I recommend that you also try raft. 

P.S. Bruce is not your enemy, he is your only true friend."
2366,"I am a 58 yo father, probably one of the oldest people playing this game. I am a single farther to my Son, who is 14 now. My son got this game for Christmas in 2021 from his uncle, so we installed it on his computer and he started playing. By the end of the week he had 18 hours on this game. This was horrible for me, as it was already hard for me to find ways to spend time with my son, as he is always out with his friends or just watching YouTube. So I decided to make a Steam account and get this game to see if I could maybe play alongside him. I loaded into the game, picked my character and started playing but I was stuck on what you where supposed to do. I asked my Son for help and he friended and invited me to join him. I loved it as it was the best time I had spent with my Son since my wife had died. This game has ever since brought me and my son closer again and now we actually spend time together outside the house together as well. This game reminded me that there's fun to be had in everything, and it has brought both me and my Son many happy memories."
2367,Good Game :)

i male 45 father, probably one of the oldest people playing this game. I am a single father to my Son, 14 now. My son got this game for Christmas in 2021 from his uncle, so we installed it on his computer and he started playing. By the end of the week he had 24 hours on this game. This was horrible for me, as it was already hard for me to find ways to spend time with my son, as he is always out with his friends or just watching YouTube. So i decided to make a Steam account and get this game to see if I could maybe play alongside him. I loaded into the game, picked my character and world and started playing but I was stuck on what you where supposed to do. I asked my Son for help and he hosted a game for me to join. I loved it as it was the best time I had spent with my Son since my wife had died. This game has ever since brought me and my son closer again and now we actually spend time together outside the house together as well. This game reminded me that there's fun to be had in everything, and it has brought both me and my Son many happy memories."

2377,"I originally played this game when it was in alpha and kept coming back every new update. 
So i have a pretty long story to it.

Now i finished it and i liked the latest update (v1.0), BUT  i feel an empty void that there should be something more to this game. I don't care about the story honestly, i like the exploration part. 

This game has a lot more potential, like solar panels, electric cables connected directly rather than using that lame battery thing, wind turbines, light bulbs and much more. People like automation, and this game should give it to the players.

The basic shark is nice in the early game, but it s really useless once you made the metal spear.
It's literally just there to be food for you. You are not his food, he is. 

The ocean needs more enemies, harder ones based on progress made. Like squids, killer whales, other shark types that are more aggressive, maybe even create some water snakes that poison and you need some kind of tincture to cure it or you will eventually die. 

The ending provides you with some basic blue prints that you should have receive a lot earlier (in my opinion).
The utopia thing was more annoying than fun, i hated the box system. Like 4 real, is 2022, boxes to climb ? 

Tangaroa was more of a final destination than Utopia for me.

Anyway, i recommend the game, but especially with friends to share tasks. Cooking, building, killing the food (shark).

Cheers and pray for the DLC.

2385,"bumbarasclat dont get me started on this game, the starting phase is extremely boring luckily i had friends with me to speed up the process. all i am gonna say is dont jump in the water the shark is on smoke he will target your nyash within 0.3 seconds of dipping your toes in. In late game me and the mandem managed to catch the shark on a lack and clap him off, we was gassed thinking we can grab all the scrap without a problem but then he just respawned on even more smoke and squad wiped us.

i recommend this game only if you have friends, if not then this aint the one for you. The shark will just keep mashing you up."

2398,"A friend of mine was playing this and I wasn't sure about it. He ended up gifting me the game and I played and instantly got hooked. Love this game! I definitely would recommend it.

The only thing I would say is negative is sometimes the ocean waves might make you a little dizzy. I tend to get somewhat dizzy or light-headed in general so after playing I would occasionally feel a little dizzy but it wasn't too bad. With that said, it comes with the territory of being on a raft in the ocean. ;)"
2399,not to bad.. better fun with the mods..
2400,"I loved this game. Very fun with friends and alone. Great game, great lore, great everything. Very fun. Very little bugs."

2402,"TLDR;
I think the developers should have really thought out the story and game play mechanics a lot more. And to not involve extended walking around on land for a game that doesn't even have a map. Its part exploration, part puzzle, part sandbox. Its great and wrong at the same time. ⭐⭐⭐ _  _ 3/5

Don't get me wrong. This game isn't terrible or anything, its just that the game mechanics suck. The art style, sounds and models are great... for the most part. For example 
The meter on the battery charger is the wrong way around. 
There are two tanks on the water storage tank. WHY??????
Snow mobile is excessively slippery. I'm sure they aren't supposed to be. 
They also get stuck in stupid places, like on staircases and easy to crash and stuck into walls/cliff sides on Temperance.
The story makes no real sense. For a game that's about a raft and it periodically requires you to go on land to solve puzzles to gain.... parts for your raft??
I have more but really its a good game that should have received more thorough bug hunting play through sessions.
I don't know how to describe the story. I think the actual story is great, but why the puzzles? They don't seem to exist for a particular reason, just another challenge to inconvenience the player. Temperance is probably the most annoying level I've played, and I thought Balboa was bad. There is literally a huge chunk of ice surrounding parts of the island for a large distance. And none of it is mapped on your 'radar'. 
It would be great if there was an option to build on islands at some point.
There are also a number of bugs in this game but they are mostly cosmetic or just plain funny. You can fish just about anywhere, including on top of a cliff, right through the terrain. Even through the top most level of your raft!
Basically all of the enemies are carbon copies of about 4, maybe 5 base types and they all share one core weakness; EXCEPT FOR THAT FU**ING BOULDER HURLING BIRD! WHY???. You can get behind just about all enemies and keep hitting them, including Bruce for an easy victory. It ruins the game once you know this. I'm going to build a giant raft that looks like an upside down pyramid since that is actually a think that is possible. Now they just need to add elevators. Thanks for reading!"

Survival genre isn't even my forte. I dislike having to stress about food thirst and tools breaking every minute. Raft though is very chill and survival never gets stressful and exhausting. You play and explore at your pace. The multiplayer experience is very smooth.

It was fun to see us start from a tiny raft and build it up. Painting and decorating made me so happy. You can genuinely enjoy the pace of progress. Some puzzles here and there, we just needed to put our brains together for. They added some more lore and characters to the game. I must say the story is very interesting. Exploring sure made go had some 'woah' moments.

And the music, goodness I LOVED the music. So relaxing and fit the mood perfectly while we were in the vast sea.

Play it with a friend or SO, it's worth it.

P.S Gotta thank my bf for always giving me decoration packages to open. Felt like christmas every time.

2440,"I like the open world rafting sandbox type thing, its something that not many games to my knowledge have, 10/10"
2441,"***This is going to be a very mixed review***

Raft okay... where to start with this? While the gameplay itself was enjoyable, I wish there was a bit more added to the story. After playing this game for ~39hrs I would've liked more context to the flood, what happened that caused everyone to build rafts and more of the struggles that humanity endured during this time, maybe even some cut scenes to add more to the story.

Some things I would like to see changed is firstly the default sprint/faster swim. Honestly it's not all that fast and when trying to get back quickly to another person who is being attacked it gets frustrating. 

Secondly my boyfriend and I encountered some problems when playing on a server with just us that I hosted. There are moments of desync or lag, but there are moments that either the game or server has bugged out completely and we have each missed out on things. One time I got into an elevator, he pressed the button to go up and for me the elevator disappeared and I got stuck in the elevator shaft. Unsure if a server restart would've fixed it or not because he continued on without me and completed the objective and I just used the unstuck option to get back to the raft. The other time was right at the end of the story, when he opened the doors for some reason I got the cut scene and set up to the grounds where all other rafters were and he did not, restarting the server did not help in this instance and because of that he missed out on the ending and was pissed off (which I mean is understandable, we both put 30+hrs into the game and he missed the ending). 

Thirdly I think the ending of the game could've used a little more to it, it just felt very.... lacking and not pleasing. 

While I would recommend this game to other friends, there are for sure things that need fixing first before I do so. This game has quite the opportunity to expand and improve and I truly hope it does, but because of the things stated above this is why I'm giving a thumbs down."

2463,"A super fun and collaborative game that keeps you on your toes with the shark, different animals on large islands, and inventory management (the big one). I play with my partner as well as a small group, and while it's chaotic, it's super fun to work with each other on making the best (or most stupid) raft we can. Only issues I have are the occasional glitches, such as me accidentally putting my clucker down on an island and he glitched into the ground. We could hear him running around, but couldn't get him out ): We still have had a great time with this game, and normally the glitches and graphics are pretty funny"

I'm always discovering new ways to decorate/configure things, which makes the act of slowly expanding my raft really satisfying. The different mechanics involved in Raft operations are also very satisfying. The survival element is not particularly challenging or gritty (which was actually a plus for me). I've only tried single player so far, and I can only imagine it improving with some friends."

I can’t recommend this game highly enough.  It’s got loads of charm and a very robust building system.  My only disappointment is that I finished the game, and there is nothing left for me to do.

Here’s hoping that another game is  in the works, or perhaps a final final chapter.  Whatever they release in the future, I will be purchasing with relish when it drops."

Some things that I would change is a way to produce plastic, or easier way to get. I didn't get enough plastic since day 1 to last day. Never enough.
Also, the slippers get ruined way too fast. I really need to swim faster.
And, finally, titanium ingots are hard to get. The metal detector should provide with more of those. I did 2 titanium required items the whole game. Couldn't get to craft end game weapons. FeelsBadMan

Mission wise, Varuna Point mission is a decisive one. You either get bored and quit the game (it's hard to move the jellyfish to get in the tunnel), but after that, it really gets interesting.

2546,"First off, love the game! played many hours building the cutest little raft with many many decorative items to choose from.
The ambience and especially the soundtrack are amazing. The graphics are gorgeous and cute. Great work on the modeling and lighting engine.

But......

A lot falls flat after a certain progression.

When i found out none of the drinks or food actually have any special buff or effect it took a huge reason away to actually farm an explore for these recipes.

Finding super rare clothing items is not so rewarding in single player because you will never actually see them on your body.

There is just one kind of meat from different animals, one kind of wood from different trees (even though there are different levels of flooring and walls etc.)

Once you found and smelted your last titanium for that last new item from the final chapter you didn't craft yet the game basically ends, while there is so much more potential to keep players engaged and exploring. 

When i saw the first polar bear i got super excited over its loot drop and possible crafting options, only to be  dissapointed by just a regular leather drop, it's stuff like this that does not make it rewarding to progress, rendering the final chapter (apart from the stories conclusion and some end game crafting recipes) almost redundant.


I really hope some things are addressed in possible future updates."

SOLO OR WITH I GROUP I 110% RECOMMEND THIS GAME!!!! 8 player multiplayer in a game that isn't competitive is such a selling point too, talk about hard to come by"
2555,It's fun.
2556,"Games fun, some annoying things but good game if you want to play with a friend/friends and live on raft exploring various islands with a little story telling, puzzles, crafting,discovery, boss fights, tropical animals. Can beat the game in 35-40 hours casually playing."
2557,"fun game. Way better with friend(s)

And there are alot of QOL mods out there to improve it further."
2558,Very addicting crafting survival game with an acceptable story.  Easy to sink hours into.
2559,"I'm not too much of a fan of survival games so I'd paid little attention to Raft - Then some friends were talking about it so I thought I'd try it out......

Raft has stolen my life, I've only had it for 2 or 3 days and any free-time I have has been sunk into this amazing game! I'd highly recommend it to anyone that has a lot of free time (and if not, enjoy sleepless nights of Raft as I have) - A Fantastic game!!!"
2560,"Great survive game, great story"
2561,"I usually play this game when I need to wind down. This game is super relaxing but also super interesting! There is a clear story and the gameplay is very streamlined. As far as I can tell there are no major bugs. Crafting is easy to comprehend and materials com fast enough to stay alive for a very long time. Even if you die and lose everything you can get is all back within an hour of playing so you don't really feel like you lose progress. 

Overall 10/10 game for the money and would recommend if you're looking for something fun to pass the time thats fun and story driven."
2562,That ending was ass
2563,Fun game. I haven't played in a while but I just learned about the update and new additions. So I back to playing. Still love it.
2564,"Yet another game that left early access far too early. This game has the most broken save system I have ever seen in 30+ years of playing computer games. At least the ones that didn't allow saving behaved more predictably than this game. The devs have gone out of their way to make it difficult to roll back saves, but they didn't bother to make sure that the game works well enough to prevent you from having to roll back. Rolling back a save means instant death when you load in, and for some reason the devs thought it was a good idea to combine that with deleting a large portion of your inventory upon death with the 'Normal' game settings. You will just have to pray that the game doesn't decide to delete the things that are vital for your survival, or respawn you under an island.

The devs were however generous enough to let players choose a game mode that doesn't delete all their stuff on death, but that also reduce the difficulty of pretty much every survival aspect of the game to the point where they may as well no longer exist.

As for the gameplay itself, floating around can be pretty chill, unless you want to try single player, in which case you will spend most of your time killing the same shark over and over again. Outside of the story locations, you will however have seen pretty much everything the game has to offer within a couple of hours. The islands just have too little variation to be interesting beyond that. Most research/equipment can be unlocked after your first visit to an island, which leaves very little sense of progression."

2566,make sure you dont cheat
2567,"fisrt was introduced to this game by Markaplier, by far my favorite game to watch,play,stream you name it. Me and my friends use this game as a way to talk and catch up and hangout. HIGHLY HIGHLY recommend"

Raft >>> Minecraft no cyappa"
2570,"I love this game. I first got into playing survival games through the horror genre, so this has been an amazing departure from that. The vibe is chill. The music is chill. The game play is also pretty chill. I love building ever more elaborate rafts. The story has a lovely, heartwarming ending. Makes you feel good. Definitely recommend."
2571,this game is really nice to play ion peaceful mode. its a relaxing way to end the night
2572,Wilson!

2578,Not for the faint-hearted... or people who suck at base-building.
2579,"The exploration of the islands is just not interesting in the slightest and the obstacles during exploration are just annoying feel too inorganic. The strict timing of the shark and animals is ridiculous.

Was most fun when sailing and building up my raft but the gameplay around this is pretty slim. 

Don't recommend solo, maybe ok with friends to mess around in."
2580,GAME GOOD
2581,good
2582,boat
2583,"Did a different set of developers create the end of the game than the beginning? It was an enjoyable chill game to play in a peaceful world but suddenly you're being swarmed by [spoiler]scuttlers[/spoiler] who attack you in peaceful mode while you have to hold E until the circle fills (that timing was clearly intentional), a [spoiler]boss fight rhino shark[/spoiler] who rams you while you are stuck underwater and repeatedly need to refill your oxygen from bubble vents since you can't leave until [spoiler]you make it ram 3 separate pillars multiple times[/spoiler] and goodness help you if you didn't have usable flippers when you entered, then there are some awful MXC sections on the final island although the crouch animation is too slow and keyboard/mouse-controls have too much input lag for it to be any fun and finish it all off with [spoiler]the giant hyena Alpha[/spoiler] who leaves poison all over and periodically turns invulnerable and does high damage and if you die you respawn at your raft and have to make your way back up (though at least they did provide some shortcuts, but it's still a trek), which is pretty much a giant f**k you to anybody who started their world in Peaceful Mode, where ""enemies are no threat"" which is a lie."

Most games I have that say 100+ hours are usually due to afk, but because you can't afk in this game (due to hunger and thirst) my 160 hours are completely legitament.

Story: the story is compelling and shrouded in mystery. Instead of being directly told what is happening you have to piece it together through notes and audio logs scattered across the world, which is always a great way to storytell imo. The story will take you to every corner of the waterlogged planet allowing you to meet interesting characters and exciting boss battles all the way through.

Gameplay: the gameplay can be quite grindy. Manually collect items in the water to make your raft bigger. create the infrastructure to support you and your larger raft. Don't forget to prepare food and drinkable water because you will need that every 20 minutes. Gain control of your raft and start heading to larger Story Islands which reward you with insight into the world around you as well as recipes that require even more grinding to get the mats for. You know, the usual.

Achievements: if you are an achievement hunter this is where the real grind comes in. Some achievements require you to kill a certain mob 50 times. The mobs in question would only be encountered like 5 times when going through the game naturally, so get used to backtracking 10 or more times. [spoiler] unless you save scum right before killing it and reload 50 times. [/spoiler] 
Other achievements require you to just spend a very long time in game. like playing for 365 in game days or finding 2 rare randomly generated islands [spoiler] however if you find one the other is usually very close by. [/spoiler]

Creativity: this is where the game truely shines imo. If you have any grand design ideas for your raft (for me I built an aircraft carrier) you will have a blast building it. From the very begining you begin unlocking crafting recipes for cosmetic items for your raft. From plants to furniture you will have a wide variety of items to customize your rafts look, including a decent color wheel to customize most every items look.

Overall opinion:
While this game can be very grindy I found myself enjoying every minute of it. The atmosphere of the game itself makes the entire journey a very relaxing experience.

8/10 would recommend

2626,"This is a really fun game when their are two or more players, but it's hard to play by yourself, mostly a the beginning because you have to collect stuff before it floats away, keep yourself hydrated and fed, and keep an eye on the shark all at the same time."

2670,"Building a floating base with your friends and sailing across the ocean is where this game truly shines. The art design presents a quirky, stylized take on ""post-apocalypse"" that's genuinely refreshing and fun. Where this game starts to suffer is in it's woefully underdeveloped combat systems. Poor feedback, glitchy animations, and barebones mechanics makes pre-alpha MInecraft feel like a rich combat experience. Even after several years it still feels like a rushed feature and makes one wonder why combat was included in the final release at all. Thankfully, aside from some inexplicably highlighted scripted fights it's generally avoidable and you'll spend most of your time sailing the ocean, cleaning it of rubbish to slowly build up and beautify your floating paradise."

You can explore and do story islands together which I LOVED. Great variety of exploration, puzzles and combat.

Looking forward to when the next chapter comes out :)"

2696,"Raft has awakened my love for these types of games with a crafting system tied in with story progression really keeps the game afloat. At the start of the game I felt a sinking feeling that I wouldn't really enjoy it cause it gives you little to nothing with just a hook on a rope you have to cast out to try to pull in a small amount of materials for crafting. 

A  2x2 tiles big starting area in a sea with Bruce the shark who wants to constantly take chunks out of your raft, and yourself, if you fall into the water. As you progress you start to see things get a little easier but your management skills come into play keeping on top of replacing or repairing the tiles that Bruce will randomly target to destroy which can be diverted by stabbing him in the face early on with a spear and eventually tiles can be protected with Metal. Bruce will eventually become less of a problem as you expand the raft and the creative side can start to flourish a bit more as you create more than just a raft but a boat and eventually a grand ship. 

The transformation of the raft is tied in with the story in such a way that it keeps you coming back for more wanting to get that upgraded ship part that makes it less needy for your attention so you can do more of what you need to do to survive and collect hopping from island to island. Perfectly ending the 365 day playthrough with the creation of a vessel that has served me well throughout my journey thoroughly painted and decorated to add a uniqueness to the ship and it is done very well. 

I have never fully played through and explored a sandbox survival game and can rate it up there with Minecraft in terms of how good a game it is.. it has been refered to as 'Mineraft' though a much different game in it's respects but my point is that they both were good at holding my attention for hours."
2697,"I've played this over the years now, watching it grow. What a great final product you've made. I felt the final fights were a little too rough for a solo experience (I actually got repeatedy stunlocked by the enemies in the second last fight which caused quite a bit of swearing as I had done the correct steps) overall, this is a great game with excellent self-paced exploration. the resource-curve is great for new players and experienced veterans who quickly turn rafts into hyper-efficient trawlers. 

The customisation and multiplayer features are great, paint your boat, make it fancy, make it flimsy, it's up to you, just keep floating and gathering planks. Tons of fun from this game, worth the money."

2706,GREAT GAME me and my dad play this game alot and its a great laugh
2707,I would consider this an excellent first entry to anyone wanting to try survival-esque games. I have immensely enjoyed being stranded on a raft as a co-op experience with my son!
2708,I've never had a more toxic-loyal relathionship with anyone than i've had with Bruce. Rip Bruce for the 1000th time <3

Its not too difficult so its enjoyable to play with others."

2725,First one shark then two sharks oh wait a third one nvm why not get five sharks attacking your raft at the same time i fucking love this game :) i have lost my hope at this point. Thanks!
2726,"it can really get addictive lol... once you get your first boat going, you don't want to stop!"
2727,refyt
2728,I had a lot of fun playing this multiplayer with a team of 5. I'm pretty sure I would have failed beating this game on my own. Some islands are very confusing and some battles were quite tough.
2729,cute game ^w^
2730,yane
2731,fun game but please add it to the ps4 please
2732,"This is one of my favourite survival games as it is a really chill sandbox survival game, where once you kickstart your boat you pretty much have the freedom to go out and explore as much islands as you want, and it becomes more of an rpg exploration game. You can also decorate your boat to look cooler and be creative."

I've spent hours just doing that in my original playthrough, and I'm about to go in for another in the full release of the game. To the devs, thank you for pouring your heart into this one. I'm so excited!"
2744,Raft is life.
2745,"This is a little steep on the learning curve on how to acquire materials, but so much fun!  And also, newbies, you can totally kill the shark.  I was shocked as heck when my husband and I first managed it."
2746,GOOD GAME TO PLAY WITH FRIENDS I JUST DONT KNOW ABOUT THE PRICE THO...
2747,"Johansson says raft too small, so I make it bigger.

Johansson says raft has ugly color, so I paint it.

Johansson says raft has no hot tub, so I threw him into the ocean. (jk<3)

Johansson says this is femdom because I am doing all the work, but he is at the grill 24/7 in-game like he is in the kitchen irl cooking for me.

2748,"Super fun, love the fact that the game doesnt force the main quest on you. I didnt even know it had a main story when I bought it lmao."

The only thing I struggle with was learning the basic rules in the beginning, but the lack of a tutorial makes it more realistic for me."
2756,YUS
2757,"Super fun with friends; extremely boring to play by yourself. This is a ""play it with friends"" game."
2758,It's a sandbox type game with an optional story line. What's not to like.
2759,"I don't understand why this is under survival simulation...NOBODY has to eat 30 fish a day to live ANYWHERE...this is FANTASY survival simulation.  They seriously need to turn down the thirst/hunger rates..pretty stupid when you have to eat/drink an INSANE amount because your game doesn't offer anything really challenging otherwise. I don't recommend at full price, 1/2 off sale only."
2760,Great Game!
2761,good
2762,IS GOOD
2763,SUCKS
2764,"Game would have been a 5 but since the update, it will no longer load, gets to about 90% and then crashes.  Appears this is happening to a lot of people and there's no fix in site,  done with this game...it was fun while it lasted, you can see how many hours I had into it... DEVS FIX YOUR DAMN GAME."

2768,"The game would be okay if Utopia didn´t exist.
Utopia Is C.R.A.P. The Islands were annoying enough, but Utopia with the Platforming BS was not just the Straw that broke the Camels back, it was the Straw, the Camel and the hospital bill.
Didn´t finish it.

But then again, here is how to have fun anyway:
Spawn all Blueprints.
Follow the Story to Caravan Island or maybe Tangaroa, so you have access to all Resources (Bees won´t spawn on islands until you visited Balboa, etc)
Switch off the Radar and follow the currents and waves, building your Raft."

2779,I liked it.
2780,GOOD GAME TRY IT THX
2781,"Let me start by saying that the raft building is well made and can be fun for a while, until you try to actually get anywhere.

I bought this way back when it first came out in Early Access so I've started over from scratch quite a few times. Every time the same thing has happened: I get started and it feels quite satisfying to solve the initial problems of fighting off the shark and getting a steady supply of food and water. 

Unfortunately, in order to get more advanced equipment, you have to follow the storyline and visit different story islands, and this is where the game starts getting annoying. Each different island has one or more ""puzzles"" you have to solve, but the main problem here is that you never really know what the pieces are, much less how they're supposed to fit together. Most of the islands are so big, systematically searching them is a real challenge because on most of them you really have no clue where you are, what exactly you're looking for or where your damned raft with all your food and water actually is. And when you finally stumble across something that might look useful, you can bet your life you're either out of food/water, your inventory is full or the sun goes down so you can't see anything.

Your raft, a mobile base, is supposed to be the focus of the game and the center piece of it all but the majority of your time is spent away from it trying to solve poorly made puzzles while wishing you were back at the raft where life is simple.

And then there's the voice acting. You pick up these notes that piece together a sort of storyline and early on these were text only, which was considerably less painful than listening to swedes trying to speak english. Thankfully, many of the recordings are of such poor quality it's hard to hear the voice at all.

After much frustration and looking up walkthroughs online, I made it to the final island where the game suddenly takes another sharp right turn and decides it wants to be the Tomb Raider game that got canned because the 3D platformer elements were just too annoying. Having stumbled, fallen down and cursed my way through an out of place obstacle course from American Ninja Warrior ONCE, then solving another stupid ""puzzle"" I then realized I had to go through that same damned obstacle course ONE MORE TIME. Don't forget that all this time you have to keep eating and drinking every few minutes to stay alive, and roughly 50% of the time is spent in darkness so you can barely make out the obstacles. After another hour of this I finally decided enough is enough.

There are so many annoying things in this game, even if you use a third party mod tool with half a dozen mods to eliminate the most annoying ones, you will eventually quit because the game is still just too annoying. Eating and drinking literally every couple of minutes. Tools and weapons that barely hold together. Batteries that last only a few minutes and can't be recharged until nearly the end of the game. Seagulls that literally consume the scarecrows meant to keep them away. Sharks that eat your raft no matter how many times you kill them. Bears and other wildlife that respawn literally faster than they can be killed. The game just keeps piling problems on problems to keep you from wanting to reach the end because the end is pointless anyway."
2782,"Really fun! Would definitely recommend. Especially when playing with friends. Love the game play, gathering stuff, finding new islands."
2783,"only 17 achievements and 16 hours in, and some of the best money i've spent on a game. lots of time playing with my dad, and good moments all along the way, and heading forword."
2784,A good litmus test to find which friends can be relied upon in survival situations xD
2785,"This is an incredibly difficult review for me to write... [u]it breaks my heart[/u]. I've been playing Raft since July of 2020, and it seems like the game has been diminishing little by little with each subsequent update. Now that the game is complete, and I have finished it, I can finally submit a review. I cannot discuss my issues with this game without mentioning the story, and while the story is not a mystery, nor does it rely on intrigue, I shall be blocking-out portions of this review that contain mild-spoilers.

[b]Chapter One[/b] was an absolutely wonderful game. Equal parts harrowing, haunting, and hopeful. It was saturated with a forlorn calm (punctuated by intense moments of crisis) brought on by the deep sense of isolation: just you, a tiny floating platform, the flotsam and junk of the ocean, and a lonely shark who wants to be mouth-friends (at least that's what's in my head-cannon). Who are you? Where do you come from? How did you get into your current predicament? All mysteries.

A strange feeling of triumph spreads through you as you slowly gain control of your surroundings and start to stabilize your new maritime life. You would see hints of other human life occasionally: notes in a radio tower, graffiti on a wall, abandoned rafts floating derelict out in the wastes of the ocean (no sign of their previous occupant). These tiny reminders that others had existed in this strange world. How long had they been gone, and were they still alive?

You come across Balboa Island - a temperate island infested with bees... and bears. Why does a temperate island with birch and pine trees exist near tropical islands with coconut palms and mango trees? Why are there so many bears? Why is there a radioactive pool near the ranger station? These were all strange, but they did not break the immersion of the game - it still [i]felt[/i] right.

Chapter One delivered a great experience - you could play it a casually or as seriously as you wanted. I eagerly looked forward to the following chapters.

[b]Chapter Two[/b] added to the game without losing much. An abandoned town of caravans, trailers, and camper vans - all teetering on rocky precipices. A high-tech biodome - complete with robot butlers patrolling the self-contained futuristic city. Both of these locations were packed with flavor... and both were abandoned. This was great world-building, with interesting environments and fanciful (yet grounded) settings and technology. Good stuff.

But Chapter Two is also where the cracks start to appear - hinting at [spoiler]the flooding of the Earth[/spoiler] and establishing the ""villain"" of the story. At the time, you don't realize that they are setting up the main bad-guy, you just think it's neat backstory (because you don't really get a sense of how long ago the events happened - was it 20 years ago, or was it last Tuesday?)

[b]The Final Chapter[/b] is where the game tries to squeak-out a fart, but ends up filling its pants with diarrhea. You end up exploring sunken [spoiler]skyscrapers[/spoiler] and realize you are now in the movie [spoiler]""WaterWorld""[/spoiler]... if [spoiler]Kevin Costner[/spoiler] came zipping-by on a jet-ski, it wouldn't feel out of place. You find tropical islands with coral reefs, pineapple and melons growing just 800 meters (that's half-a-mile) from an arctic research station with polar bears and glaciers. Any sense of immersion you've managed to build crumbles quickly.

The story culminates at the final location, Utopia, where (and I have to type this slowly, so I don't have a stroke) the mustache-twirling nincompoop-of-a-villain has taken over with the help of [spoiler]his army of radioactive hyenas[/spoiler]. I wish I was joking about that. This guy feels like he was rejected from an episode of the '60s ""Batman"" TV show (with Adam West and Burt Ward). He proceeds to lead you through the saddest funhouse ever designed for a game, full of platforming (in a game not designed for platforming). At one point there are a series of fans that are spinning for no reason. It's not like they are windmills that are generating power, or pumping water, or grinding food... nope, they have no in-world reason to exist - they are just obstacles for the sake of being obstacles to your movement. They [b]are[/b] made of fabric and wood though, so you should be able to simply destroy them with your ax, right? Of course not... in fact, if you get close to them, they will bounce you away - like a drunken hamster ricocheting around inside of a dryer (because physics be damned).

Now I hear you saying: ""But Gent, you throbbing fop, why don't you just shoot the villain with arrows?"" To which I tell you, I did. I riddled that guy with arrows, they do nothing. The game is going to force you through a series of puzzles and platforming until it comes time for you to face-off against his [spoiler]legion of special-needs hyenas[/spoiler]. The final one will [spoiler]vomit acidic mutagen[/spoiler] and [spoiler]throw [b]boulders[/b][/spoiler] at you (as [spoiler]hyenas[/spoiler] are known to do). It's [i]EXACTLY[/i] what a game about ocean-survival needs: [spoiler]hyenas[/spoiler], the most dangerous ocean predator on the planet.

The worst part of all this is after you defeat the villain and he says something to the effect of: ""these survivors are weak, and dumb, and they need someone strong and smart to take charge."" To which I realize the villain is [b][u]100%[/u] correct[/b]. These idiot survivors saw a lunatic leading a [spoiler]battalion of radioactive hyenas[/spoiler], and instead of killing him on the spot, they welcomed him into their community. Humanity will not survive much longer in this game, because the survivors are all brain-damaged.

So, in closing, the game of Raft (much like this review) starts off coherent and grounded, only to devolve into utter clown-world madness.

I will continue to play every once in a while, exclusively for the casual experience of floating around and crafting a nicer raft - and if that's your interest in this game (the MinecRAFT experience) then you will find some enjoyment in playing it. But as a reviewer, I will address the game that the developers [u]actually[/u] made, the story they [u]actually[/u] wrote, and not the experience you can craft for yourself. The sandbox aspect is fine, but the game itself [b]sucks[/b]."

2810,"You should pet the shark, it is friendly and likes to be pet."
2811,Fun with friends
2812,
2813,Raft is a fun survival/crafting/building game with a beautiful aesthetic and atmosphere and tons of possibilities. I highly recommend Raft to fans of other survival crafting games like Minecraft or Valheim.
2814,"recommended, so fun"
2815,Nice
2816,
2817,"Sometimes you just gotta float.

Really, though, float away."
2818,
2819,"its really fun sometimes it gets boring but sum like 10 mins after ist sooo fun aagain, big a$$ recomend"
2820,Sheeeeeeeeesh
2821,"This one's an easy recommendation!

Raft is a very relaxing game. The music, atmosphere, graphics and setting are really pleasant.
The gameplay can become somewhat repetitive at times, but that's not necessarily bad if your goal is to just unwind, sometimes it can be meditative. Like fishing. 
It's interesting to discover something new to craft or cook, it's not too straightforward, yet easy to learn. The controls are intuitive. 
Coop also works well. 
There's a reasonable amount of space for your creativity in building your personal dream raft, you can build ridiculous contraptions or keep it mostly realistic. There's a creative mode in which you can just build to your heart's content without worrying about that pescy resource-collecting.

The story is neat. Raising awareness of pollution in the oceans is important and this game does it implicitly by having you collect garbage from the water all day.  Also climate change in general. The basic premise of the game of sealevels rising to a point where only a couple of islands remain dry is also pretty in your face.

I've played through the whole story multiple times by now[spoiler], as the islands on which it takes place will reset, for the most part, once you've left them. You can just loop around from the beginning again, or choose to only revisit certain places.[/spoiler]"

2823,"This game is extremely fun! especially when playing with friends, i named the sharks and made tombstones for the ones we ate lol"
2824,Fun but i fucking hate you bruce

2826,ITS FRICKIN GREAT!!!!!!

2847,Mt TOP!
2848,"The story almost took it to a negative for me. Just compelted it and if that was the scoring criteria i have no doubt.
But in the end, Raft started as a fun entertaining raft builder where you can enjoy building massive designs while sailing around and ill let that be the main pull of the game.
And nothing about the bad feeling i have now effect the amazing core gameplay loop there exist and is fun and entertaining to make."

2856,The goddamn bird.
2857,ummm well i got stuck in a hole
2858,really fucking good game
2859,"this game is good for all kinds of players, explorers, builders and researchers. This game is really realistic. In this game, you don't just have to survive on your raft, you have to thrive. You can play survival and creative and change your difficulty. I have no dislikes about this game and love it as much as any other."
2860,amazing  game
2861,Good.

2867,It's a very fun and adventurous game that'll help make your day better
2868,lots of fun ngl
2869,"I thought I was just in for a relaxing beachy game, but discovering the story of Raft was really interesting and I appreciated the challenges each story island presented. Now that I've finished the story, I'm enjoying getting creative with my raft design and revisiting some parts of the story to finish achievements. I stayed away because first-person tends to make me queasy, but I was pleased to find this game doesn't trigger that problem. 10/10"
2870,Chill survival vibes ruined by the worst forced combat and platforming imaginable.
2871,Best with friends! Now with the ending in this game this is really a good game. Tons of things to do and explore!
2872,Boss fights and platforming sucks. Tons of bugs and glitches. Too much grind as a solo player.
2873,Nice game to killing time with friends
2874," I know I might not be supposed to rant about this, but I clicked the top choice on the screen thing and now it looks like a game that's been taken and ripped apart. If there's a way to play it like that or to get it back to boarderless please reach out to me at Mokeefe0417@gmail.com. Also for any hackers, PLEASE DONT HACK INTO MY EMAIL. Thank you and have a nice day."
2875,"Sometimes I reflect on games that I play and usually I feel positive about the game I reflect on. However this is an exception, I enjoy raft for short periods however this game is so boring because of a cycle. There is a point in this game where a cycle takes control of gameplay. which is: Run out of supplies, scavenge for supplies, eat food, drink water, use supplies, repeat.

4/10 Its fine for a short time"
2876,Peaceful and fun game +1
2877,good game shark likes to nibble me tho
2878,Nice Game

2885,yes
2886,"this game is fun...full stop
"
2887,"The game was a great ocean survival game until the devs played subnautica for the first time and decided to shoe horn an inferior clone of said game. I had so much fun on the prior updates, but the final chapter decided to shoe horn in a confusing story told out of order to maximize confusion. Also, the ending of the game was confusingly changed to a E rating and the dev's refusal to add cartoon violence to people"
2888,
2889,The shark can eat my bals
2890,amazing
2891,"Much more fun playing with others, would recommend finding some friends to play along with"
2892,this game slaps
2893,good
2894,Fantastic game with an intriguing story.  The pacing in the early game is a bit slow but once you have collection nets on your raft the game feels much better.
2895,really mediocre if you are not planning on grinding for eight hours every so often.
2896,"While the game was enjoyable to play solo, I would probably recommend playing with a friend for the company. Also the game isn't exactly challenging, yet sometimes the puzzles are either obvious, or take a little bit of time to complete."
2897,"very very realistic
"
2898,"THIS. GAME. IS. EPIC. The storyline goes so deep, and the game includes automation, which is my personal favorite feature in a game. if there is a RAFT 2, I want to know."

2907,"Would absolutely recommend this game. We used about 48 hours to finish this game on normal as a duo. Wanted it to be more of an adventure than a challenge. I enjoy building and planning so it was cool to find new stuff to add to the raft underway. Only thing I wish they added to the game are ""secret islands"", where you find a treasure map, a puzzle/riddle or a coordinate to find bonus encounters and loot. The raft-following shark could also need some variety added to it."
2908,This game is good but i think if people who never play survival game then go to normal without tutorial must be die
2909,is good

2926,"I put off buying this game for a long time, Your on a raft in the middle of the ocean, what a boring concept, well i was wrong, yes at first when i started i though ok ill build a raft from the floating scrap that that will be  my few hours of fun, 

Well after building a sustainable raft i managed to get a receiver and antenas this pretty much opens the story up, you follow the ""clues"" which leads you to islands and other great eviroments, without giving to much away the story (for a survival game) is pretty good, i couldnt wait to get to each new destination to find out what had happened,  

i didnt think the crafting would be as good as it was either, 

There are a lot of little things that added into the game that although it wasnt needed it adds a little extra, like there is a point in the game you use your bow and arrows to do something other then kill (not going to say where or when) also when placing crafted items a LOT of items turn into wall, ceiling or floor versions, which was a great touch, almost every item crafted is paintable also,

They put a lot of work into each new chapter, i feel the could have made of stick around them longer, they really did a good job of the areas but you dont really spend much time at each area, they could have probably milked it added me quests in 

Now the bad points
Painting - when painting stuff it looks very rustic, newly painted stuff shouldnt look rustic
Fishing - Fishing is very unrealistic, yes its a game and cant expect realism ,But.. i can run around anywhere, land, sea, top of a mounting casting my rod and catch fish lol
End game - there is no end game content which for a suvival is normal and i can accept that but the best weapons and tools (titanium) are unlocked after the game is complete and the best crafters are unlocked softly before that,
Radio - the radio is very repetitive and although you can get tape cassets or turn it off its still annoying.

overall the game is very good and i would recommend it to anyone. its priced way to low if you ask me.

"
2945,IT IS VERY FUN AND ENTERTAINING
2946,"Game is still scuffed as all hell. You anchor your raft in the wrong spot and it throws a shitfest. I understand the game is supposed to be challenging at times, but when it feels like the game deliberately goes out of its way to fuck you in the ass, that takes the cake for me. Do yourself a favor and save your money until they can get this shit storm in true working order."
2947,I have made it my mission to kill all sharks! get ready for a new twist on shark week!
2948,"Cool concept, but the main story line is super lame. Forcing the player to do a bunch of fetch quests to advance the tech tree is really annoying."
2949,"Combating 'beasts' have no hit reaction beyond a sound and small FX, the goat keeps moving crazy fast. Hit it 4 times with a spear, and nothing. The grapple mechanic feels super rough and not very fun, leaving you to have to swim to go get resources. Ingredients for new things feel like they're totally random Vs deliberate and something players can 'learn' now to tech advance up. with only ~2 hours in the game feels like it's still very much in a alpha state. IMO, save your money and go play Valheim."
2950,i personaly dont like it youtubers made it seem more fun however it is rnjoyable when u finaly kill a shark

2969,"The first part of this game, the survival part, gets a 10 out of 10.  One of the best games that I have played and why this game gets a positive review.

You start on a tiny raft, and you have to decide how to balance your efforts towards several objectives including:
·         Figuring out where your next drink or meal is coming from.
·         Gathering materials to craft several key upgrades, each of which are massive quality of life improvements.
·         Keeping the shark from eating your raft.
·         Expanding your raft so you have space for all your new stuff.
·         Working on the receiver so that you can start the story.

This part of the game is very engaging and intense (in a good way).  Do you make shark bait out of your last two fish so that you can gather that last bit of clay and sand to make your first smelter?  Or do you just try to gather it with the shark still in the water?  Or do you try to kill the shark?  Or do you cook and eat the fish so that you don’t die!  And then wait until you find a new island to make your smelter? One bad decision can lead to your death (especially on hard mode).

All of the millstones that you reach during this part of the game feel like HUGE achievements and are huge quality of life increases:
·         The constant threat of dying from hunger or thirst turns into just a minor inconvenience once you upgrade your grill and purifier.
·         Gathering resources is so much faster and easier once you upgrade your weapons/tools from wood/plastic to metal.
·         No longer need to worry about hooking trash at sea once you have enough collection nets.
·         Shark can no longer eat the raft once you armor it up.
·         You no longer have to trip over all your equipment crammed onto a tiny raft once you expand the raft and/or build a second story.

Unfortunately, this leads to the second part of the game, the story/puzzle part, that gets a 5 out 10.

The actual story and puzzles are OK, but nothing amazing.  If the game was JUST focused on the story, it would be nothing special.  There are still a few big items to build towards like a backpack or an engine, but the whole struggle for survival vs upgrading your raft/gear is gone.

Most of the end game upgrades are just not that big of a quality-of-life improvements over what you were using before.  In fact some are downgrades!  Everything being battery powered is nice, but at this point you are normally swimming in excess wood, so keeping batteries charged is just as much work as pulling some wood out of that chest where you are storing 500 planks from all your collection nets.  

While we are on negatives:
·         The game lacks any real reason to play once you ""beat"" it.  I am at the point now where I have a titanium/electric everything, a whole farm full of livestock, and chests full of every material.  There is just nothing else to do or any super long term items or goals to build towards.
·         I know everyone complains about the Screecher, but here I go too.  Now the Screecher isn't really ""hard"", it just seems so out of place compared to how ""hard"" everything else is.  You can only really get one shot on it every time that it takes a pass at you, yet it has as much HP as a bear, so it just takes SO LONG to kill it.  It should have like half the hit points (similar to the lighter colored Screecher on Caravan Island).
·         Once you play the game enough, you realize that islands are not actually random.  There are only 10 possible small islands and 4 possible large islands.  I have played enough that I have all the islands memorized, and there is no more sense of exploration.  It would be nice if they had a way to add in true island randomization.
·         Once about half way through the story (Caravan Island), there are no new island types or new raw materials after titanium."

I hardly never write a review to a game but Raft....

I played it with my GF and we have a ton of fun together! Build up a raft, built it so it fits both our desire and exploring the islands is a great experience. 

The game is easy to understand, straight forward and there is always something to do and it is never boring!

Maybe its my boomer brain but if theres a stone and I have to let my character die while I go and check the wiki on how to harvest it, find that there is nothing there and then find a reddit post explaining how you have to be fully submerged to harvest it, your game design is awful. The best part was that both times I gave this game a shot, this happened and sent me back to the exact same reddit post."

3024,"    This is possibly one of the worst games ive ever played. The devs need to know what to work on, fix and straight up take out of the game. Through the however many hours I have had on this game trying to 100% it, and the 1-1.5 year gap i took in the middle after for some reason coming back to the game, they still have not fixed the water clipping through the floor of your raft. The achivement system is on the edge of garbage, and actual poop in a bag. They were very unoriginal as well when it came to achivements, most of them were just killing a certain amount of enemies just like i want to absolutly obliterate the devs.
Thank you for this masterpeice

3029,"This is quite possibly the best video game ever created. It's truly an immersive and fun experience that has completely changed my perspective on gaming. There are zero flaws to this game. When I first played this game, I fell completely in love with it, I quickly disregarded all other activities, only stopping for food and sleep. I do not regret my decision to play 150 hours on this game because every single minute of this experience was extremely moving. In fact, before playing this game, I had critical depression, but as soon as I started playing, it instantly went away. I cannot explain in more detail about how good this game truly is. To the developers who created this masterpiece: thank you for transforming my entire life."
3030,"This game is very fun at the beginning but after a bit you start to get really pissed by very little things. The ending is very confusing had was kinda pointless. The final boss fight was horrible. The story is lame and does not make me want to ""explore more"", the game systems are ABSOLULTY NOT made for platforming but level design has so much of it. 

10/10 except for the fact that I still need 1 more dev painting and I haven't found it after way more than 100 treasures"

3054,"Gathering resources is usually a grind buts it's not too bad in this game. It's actually fun and when you cant be bothered, let the catch nets on your raft do the gathering for you (for some resources, others you have to get yourself).
It doesnt force you to grind for the best resources for the best parts to complete the story which i liked.

Overall. Pretty fun and you can progress through the story at your own speed. Felt like an adventure."

All in all, you won't regret buying this game."

3077,"Overall this is a good game, it has low requirements, its fun to play and has some interesting mechanics. HOWEVER, with the release of chapter 3 (patch 1.0) I have to say, I am extremely disappointed. Ton of annoying puzzle and some of them take ages to complete and the last location has near-impossible jumping section, perhaps if you're into old jumping games (Mario or smth) then its fine. Otherwise its a torture, therefore, just for sh*tty design of last two locations in the game, 4 out of 10."

3083,"If your really into a survival game with a bit of grinding this is for you! you can really do whatever you want in raft, make a world and its all yours. there is an story mode in game but it's not mandatory. like i said you can do whatever you want for example build a huge raft or do the story mode in between. if you have a friend who also likes this game it's perfect! the only downside for me was that the story was short and once you beat the story you only have a few things to do left. so after the story you could get all the achievements or make a huge raft. but the first few hours are totally worth it and fun especially with a friend."

3102,"Very fun, I'm glad they finally updated it to have an ending, even if it has a slightly different vibe than the rest of the game. I like the different options for different players, like peaceful and just building."
3103,"Hello,
           Summary of the game - 
         Raft is a unique sandbox survival game with much to offer. A fun and enjoyable game that keeps you entertained for many hours to come. The idea of beginning on a small raft with only a scrap hook, gives the player a sense of bewilderment and excitement of what's to come. As you build your raft, you soon discover a story that unravels as you develop with your resources and equipment. A story that makes you want to come for more.
    From my personal experience from playing this game -
         As a person who deeply enjoys survival games, this game took this basic principle and excelled beyond the average norm. It is so entertaining to develop from nothing into a fully functional ship or home or whatever your imagination takes you. The story is what I enjoyed the most out of the game. With its mysterious tone as you uncover all of the locations and find remnants of the past makes it so pleasing. The game is simply phenomenal. The developers of the game are so talented and passionate, and even though they may have a small team, they were able to create one of the best game I've ever played before. So if it is not obvious, I recommend you play this game.

Thank you for such a wonderful game, and I am excited to see what is next,
Simple_Player

3106,"Help! I have an addiction to Raft. Raft has become my go to chill game with the zen music and the mindless gathering of stuff. I've played through the game once in co-op and it was a super fun adventure even though I feel like the last chapter's platforming took away a bit of the chill fun of the game. I'm currently on a solo playthrough where I'm taking my time building my dream raft and building dumb collections of junk that I probably don't need. Some of the enemies are annoying but once you get use to their patterns they become less annoying to deal with(except screechers, they are always awful)."
3107,good game

3111,"The game is addicting and fun; however, I've noticed that when I play with one of my friends, one of us will have lag issues (the one who DOESN'T create the world), rendering the game almost unplayable. Apparently this is a known issue, as its listed as one of the problems in the FAQ that is under investigation...but I'm not exaggerating when I say its almost unplayable for one of the two people. Otherwise, its a fun game that causes time to FLY by you."

3131,the shark eats ur ass sometimes idk
3132,"Finished the story and honestly could have kept going, each location was unique and listening to the voice notes was cool. Game doesn't hold your hand all the way through and some of the puzzles are genuinely challenging (had to resort to google a few times). If you get into it it's the kind of game you can lose yourself in for hours without noticing, and must mention it's really fun with friends, also easier. Not sure how long I'll take but I'm gonna try to build everything and possibly unlock all the achievements"

Though the combat is clunky and the final story area was underwhelming, with the final boss going on for way too long. Hopefully later patches fix up the issues, but overall it is a fun game. I look forward to the creators' future projects."

I'm an action adventure, rpg player. I like survival games, but survival games with friends is even more fun. I would absolutely recommend I have about 40 hours in just a couple of weeks. I feel like I got more than my money out of it already."

3171,"We played this as a family with our teenage kids and they love the game, building and customizing the raft and adventuring through the islands.  What we found very unique about this game is that you get to build and customize your base (the raft) and take it with you throughout your journey.  Whereas in most all other games they have to have a fast travel or some other mechanism to get around quickly.   We hope the developers continue to make additional story content for the game past the final chapter.  Thanks for putting together such an amazing experience!"
3172,Find a couple of friends and play it through.
3173,"Definitely a game that takes a while to get in to, but once you progress far enough you'll become addicted to the amazing survival aspects. Raft actually reminds me a lot of Minecraft in which you're constantly upgrading and going through your resources but I truly find the grind fun! Overall a really fun game that you can easily get many many hours out of. Also both the wild and domestic animals are very cute ^-^"

3175,"A pretty fun until you get to Utopia, the final level.  Then the story line of the game abruptly ends and you get all the end game tools AFTER beating the game, which I find a little stupid."
3176,"Very good, keeps you entertained for hours"
3177,"refunded the game because if you lose your starter raft, you must restart"
3178,Fun and Good Storyline.
3179,"Raft is two different games: the first is a crafting survival game that manages to balance high levels of tension with the fundamentally chill experience of floating at sea with your friends. The second game is a congealed blob of puzzle, platform and combat which the developers try to ram down your throat more and more as the game goes on. 

Unfortunately, the second part of raft utterly eclipses the first, retroactively ruining any enjoyment you might get out of its early hours.

My partner and I started in the middle of the ocean on a 2x2 piece of plastic and wood that was being devoured by a shark. It's a great intro, and the frenetic panic that you're set into sets the scene for the early game, scrambling for resources to make sure you don't starve, don't dehydrate, and don't let the ground beneath you physically run out when the shark comes for you.

This early part is brilliant. When we first spotted land, my partner and I were legitimately ecstatic knowing that there was some reprieve from the ocean. Then the shark started devouring the raft again, so we moved in a hurry to chop down every tree and move on like a particularly ineffective virus. 

Eventually you'll come across floating wreckages, and recipies for radio masts, essentially the gateway to the game's story. You'll get radio signals which take you to large story-based locations. The first couple are exciting- they contain lots of resources that are hard to get on the ocean, blueprints for something new, and the light amount of combat needed is a bit of a breather at that point in the game. 

Fundamentally though, the game is still an exploration based survival game, letting you slowly carve out a bigger and better raft with increased chances for survival. The moment you can first totally armour your raft is a legitimate cause for celebration, because the shark is suddenly not the omnipresent threat it once was. There's still danger around every corner though, as resources are scarce, and the islands get slowly more dangerous.

This is where Raft peaks though, becuase the developers clearly ran out of ideas around the fourth story location. By the time you get to this point, you're essentially self-sufficient on your little raft, and there's not much worth actually exploring these islands for.

Every story location then boils down to a little treasure hunt for random objects which you need to puzzle, platform, or combat your way to get to. It becomes monotonous, and at some points you could forget you were even playing a survival crafting game with your own raft. It's especially incongruous when we can't actually pick up any of the items in these large, expansive near-city level biomes, when we're still using some hackneyed battery-powered grill back on the raft.

Things especially nose-dive in the final location. The platforming in this level is shockingly bad, and would make you think the devs ripped this level and physics engine from the asset store or something similar. The final boss is a giant hyena which you have to painstakingly hack to death, lest you die and need to respawn at your raft missing most of your end-level gear.

It's a shame, because I feel the devs forgot people would want to play a game where you sail the ocean on a home-made raft, not engage with their boring characters, or interact through the most bare-bones platforming and combat imaginable. I'm still baffled at the missed opportunity to have the player craft most of the items needed to get through the story islands, instead having resources pile up in lockers in their hundreds unused. 

Overall, I'd say there's a good 25 hours of content in raft with you and some buddies, but once you finish Tangaroa, just switch the game off and leave with the fond memories."

3224,"Great game, great concept reminds me of water world. Bu fun and great for multiplayer and solo play and just chill and play ."
3225,very good very nice
3226,"I was not interested in this game until my girlfriend started playing it.  Then I played and she couldn't so she bought a PC herself so she can play with me and my friends.  Finally a multiplayer survival that is chill as it gets.  This game is absolutely one of the most fun games I have played.  And I'm a 90's baby ya'll.

There are a few mechanics that need to tighten up, hit boxes seem to be a little clunky on the animals.  I wish we could sprint just a hair faster so there feels like a difference between sprinting and walking.  But those are my only complaints!  Otherwise, we enjoy this game very much!"
3227,"Something that annoys me is that I can't throw seeds into the recycler, but I guess it was a game balance decision considering that it's pretty hard to overlook. Best played with other people over voicechat, but I've been on my singleplayer world a lot longer than I've been playing with friends. The game definitely has longevity, it can not be beaten in 2 hours. I'm still not done with it, and I barely have any AFK time which leads me to a negative on the game- It feels poorly optimized, if I put my laptop on my lap I'd probably have burns. I need a better cooling system for my laptop than the default fans so that's partly on me though."
3228,"Pirated this game as a buddy wanted to try it and see if we liked it. It was so good we both bought it. Great game.

Doesn't seem like there's much of an endgame once you get through the story though. For a good 30 hours of fun though, I can't really complain!"
3229,Fun relaxing game
3230,Super fun
3231,"Really fantastic start to the game. 
Completely enthralling! 
I took my small raft and built a ship! 
Mid game was a bit grindy but nothing I couldn't handle! 
Tremendous amounts of fun!
The end game was the worst experience in gaming that I can remember.
I hated every moment.
Made me hate the entire game.
I regret building an awesome ship.
I hate my PC for running the game.
Shift delete alt control pull the power cable.

Great start.
Great pace.
Pure hatred at the end."

3233,Fun but can be boring so play together or watch a stream or smth while playing.
3234,"I went into this game without high expectations as generally I don't like survival games. 
This game is one of those few that surprise me with their quality. It's an absolute masterpiece with interesting story and amazing moments. It has boss fights... I went in blind and had no idea. Absolutely amazing, pick this up and play it with a friend."
3235,"When i bought this i was expecting ""rust - boat edition"", and that's largely what i got. Just so happens i absolutely love Rust so a nautical spin on it was more than welcome.

What i wasn't expecting to get out of Raft was one of the most profoundly therapeutic things i've ever played. Staring out at the endless blue catching materials drifting towards me in the current, listening to the subtle creaks and cracks of the raft, the gentle lapping of the waves and most importantly that [i]beautiful[/i] soundtrack that occasionally pipes up. The simplicity of the experience is perfectly honed to a repetitive but satisfying and fun game loop - it's absolutely fantastic.

The art style of the game is great, i'd describe it as ""play-doh"", not going for photo realism but also not going for full on cartoon network - suits the game perfectly, great choice by Redbeet interactive on that front. Also makes the game a fair bit lighter than rust, runs beautifully without turning settings way down.

Still early days for me playing this, got a funny feeling i'm still going to love it to pieces 500 hours in.

"
3236,"This game is amazing

3240,"It's a beautiful, fun game and well worth the money. I love what you can build on your raft. Excellent."

3253,"This game is a 1 time play, game starts off nice, progressive, but then sticks you to the storyline. No sidequests, only has 3 chapters? The last boss fight is only 2 minutes. The game is called ""Raft"", but youre mostly on story islands and cities."
3254,"Raft is slow paced chilled game, except for Bruce the shark. the main objective of the game is very good, except they give you no hints for what you need to do at story locations. Bruce will constantly attack your raft unless you place a block outwards and reinforce it every 4 spaces on your raft. It's a very good game if you want to play a slow paced game over time."
3255,This game is the best game i have found in a while and it is super fun i definitely recommend it
3256,"A few bugs and a little clipping here and there with the shark, but for the most part a very well polished and fun game. Lots of crafting, building, and swimming to be found here!"
3257,I have had this game for the past 3 days and i already have 18 hrs on. before you assume i have no life pls note that this game was purchased to have fun with one of my bestfriends.  This game suits every need in a survival game i wanted without being too diffucult.  Despite a $20 price tag it is well worth the money i can not wait to get further in the story and strive instead of survive.
3258,Really fun building and survival game. I hope the developer could just leave it as is without adding the crappy story line and the stupid ending
3259,Yeah definitely
3260,"Spawn in, find garbage with fren, build upon raft, row at approx. 0.5 mph in order to find small islands, mine, get ass beat by shark, fren picc you up and put you in bed, wake up, attempt to kill shark, get ass beat*2, find story objects, shark eat raft, attempt to kill shark again, get ass beat; rinse and repeat.

3267,This Game Is Very Fun Especially With Friends
3268,YESSS
3269,really simple survival game with a ton of depth. all it needs is mod support and controller support.
3270,"I really want to give the game a thumbs up...however the content in the ""Final Update"" really was too slapdash. It doesn't really tie in the narrative up to that point and sadly it ends without giving the player a reason to keep rafting(Such as some kind of repetitive  endgame system of one sort or another.) Overall this game had alot of potential in the first half but the second half left something to be desired."

3312,fun with friends
3313,"Greatly enjoy the game. A lot of fun to play with friends as you end up having a common goal work together to achieve them.

We just made it to the first radio tower which has been challenging but doable.

I would like to see maybe a equiptable torch option for darker environments and possibly a challenging sea creature boss instead of just dealing with the shark every couple minutes."
3314,"Such a great concept for a game so much so that I'm wanting to play it with all the nuances that come with it. I bought this game AFTER it was fully released, I understand it spent a lot of time in early access; which only leads to my confusion as to why they claimed it to be finished when it is still missing some basic essentials nearly every game comes with. By that I mostly mean the fact that there is no tutorial or game hints to show you basic controls on how to operate the game. Be prepared to learn this game on youtube first as not everything is immediately obvious. 

I've also found that building, even while in creative mode, is incredibly limiting. You basically have to guess on what you can or cannot do till the game accepts or rejects as there is no guidance on where you can or cannot place items and building structures. I feel like I'm building blind. Youtube is a little help, but there is very little guidance though some people have posted helpful tutorials and workarounds. 

I'm surprised there is no workshop support, this game seems perfect for it, but along my youtube journey on learning this game I've also seen some people using mods so there must be some kind of third party mod support.

Over all it's really the weird limiting building system, or lack thereof, as to why I cannot recommend this game. If you don't care about building the rest of the game isn't nearly as awkward to learn.


Edit: The more hours I put in the more I hate everything about building in this game.

3328,"Really fun game, you never know what is around the next corner. There is also a real sense of progression in this game. It's amazing to look back to the start where I was on a 1X1 raft and compare it to where I am now. I would recommend running the game with at least one other person. It makes managing the raft and getting through the various puzzles you'll find so much easier and enjoyable. You'll definitely get your money's worth out of this $20 game."
3329,Bread
3330,Extremely terrifying and if you have thalassophobia (fear of the ocean)  then it's EXTREMELY terrifying. Like one time i was collecting sand and then i look up to go to the surface and the sharks jaw was RIGHT there like leaping at me and it's EXTREMELY fun with friends. I like to think that this whole ocean is humanity now it was taken away by a massive tsunami and a flood at the same time that's my theory. I may not have seen ALOT of the game but overall it's pretty good with friends and solo too! I have seen videos of this game but i will not spoil ALOT if you are looking for a game ALL about a oceanic world full of dangers in the ocean. I HIGHLY recommend this game. It's cool on creative too but i wish there was enemies in creative mode and allowing the enemies to attack you. Graphics are absouletely great the ocean below is AMAZING and the whole idea of this game is pretty interesting like the mechanics you have to use a hook to get resources a very cool way of getting resources. So overall if you LOVE the ocean or fear it i still think this is the game for you if you are getting this then i wish you the best of luck!
3331,"this wasw the funnest experience ever i  reccomend this to everyone! if someone says its bad they dont know the real experience, trust me as someone with three times the games content hours (5 hours) its a fun game!"

3333,best game send me dm if you wanna play raft the game is so fun even without the story
3334,"really good story really good sandbox
would recommend to someone who wants a open world sandbox and story rich game
it has decent multiplayer not the best i have seen but good only problem is it is hard to start with 2 or more people
i wish there was more character selection but if you are playing single player dont worry
it is worth it i think that if you want a open world sandbox and story rich game"
3335,"I do wish the game was more noob friendly, but this is pretty common for survival based games.  They just throw you in the game and tell you GL.  No real tutorial or explanation beyond a simple explanation of your first 2 recommended items.  That's it.  But that's fine, and otherwise I loved this game.  The online mode also works very well with no noticeable lag,  Single player and multi player both feel finished and there was a recent update too which was nice!  Overall I'd recommend this game.  The one complaint I have is that their graphic settings try to be funny, but it ends up being confusing (no low/med/high, they use custom identifiers which are extremely confusing).  EX: Is Extreme or Better going to use higher end graphics?  Better is.  I don't get it either.  Maybe it would have been better if it went like Extreme (low) Better (med) Best (high), as an example.  Given this is my only complaint, I am very happy with my purchase, because that is nitpicking at best.  Also if the game crashes a lot like mine did, try reducing graphics.  It went full force at 120hz and a resolution higher than my set resolution.  Reducing the settings helped me with BSOD/crashing."

3397,"

3398,honestly one of the best adventure games iv ever played in a long time dude
3399,"Although the story of raft isn't one of the best, the gameplay really is solid. At first you start out as a mess just trying to survive, but after a while (when you have collected enough materials) you reach a point, where it feels like you can just kick back and enjoy the view. 
Of course you are constantly getting nagged by a shark, but what starts out as a monster ends up being a tiny annoyance once in while. 
I have played it both coop and solo, and sharing the experince with someone is defintly recommended, but it still keeps much of the charm playing it solo. You aren't losing out if you don't have any friends wanting to play it, but if you do have someone take them along the ride. Nothing is more fun than making some wacky stuff for the other (without their permission) and then seeing their reaction.

To me raft is around 3.5 out of 5, mostly because of some the major clipping problems you experince anchoring at an island when the sea is very agitated alongside the minimalistic story. The story is there with full voice acting and all, but so far I can't really recall what excatly we are doing story wise. If the major clipping problems gets fixed it well definetly get 4 out of 5, but at its current state it clocks in at a solid 3.5 for me.

Hope you'll enjoy it as much as I have so far :)

TLDR: It's good, better with a friend, but don't play it for the story"

There is so much to do! The amount of stuff you can craft for your raft is quite good, there are animals you can hunt and some you can tame, lots of treasures to dig up, and resources to find. Also, there are hats! Even some animals you hunt down, you can wear their heads, either that or put them on the wall as trophies. There are machines and upgrades to accomplish, and if you already explored the locations from the story, you can always go back to explore what you missed -, and even get more resources because they respawn."

3425,"I really like the concept and story of the game but some of the gameplay aspects are lacking. for instance what if you wanted to play with friends but wanted to start on different rafts, well that's simply not possible you both get stuck on the same little raft with no means of splitting apart. another problem is if you lose your raft you can build a new one so say that you are playing on hardmode and you lose your raft, well you're just sore out of luck at this point. 

The game has potential and i loved playing this game with my friends it's not a bad game it just has some bad aspects to it and is still very much playable, but i feel like there should be a bit more quality of life patches to the game which i feel would warm me up to playing this game significantly more. 

If you Like:
Base Building w/ friends
Fishing
Decoration
Exploration
and LORE

I would reccomend this game

if you Don't like:
Tedious Gameplay loops
Resource Management 
or Having to Restart and entire save.

I would recommend Playing on the Normal Difficult or just simply not buying this game."

3472,"Nice polished survival experience with a story that keeps you pushing forward. Good balance between the desire to improve your Raft and pursuing the next story chapters. The only issue is the later steps of progression don't really get a chance to shine or make an impact, because once the story concludes there's little to no reason to keep playing. Outside of this, the build system in the game actually works great and makes building the raft a fun process.

You can also mod the game to fine tune your experience quite easily by using the Raft Mod Loader. Few examples of what I used:

[list]
    [*]Statistic Mod - shows more information in the UI like healthbars
    [*]Minimap - self explanatory, great help in co-op play
    [*]No Durability Plus - can modify durability values based on slot/type (I thought default was a bit too grindy, with everything breaking all the time, so I set 3x durability)
[/list]

Overall a great concise experience that you can do solo or in co-op. Definitely recommended."

3508,"Not a fan of the online DRM (also not a fan of developers trying to play it off as an ""unfixable bug""). Also the survival aspect feels bolted on. Survival hasn't been a significant challenge but you'll have to learn how to survive the tedium. The basic construction has been an incredibly boring unenjoyable grind so far. Every tool is consumable and the shark will disassemble the raft and undo your work while you're away gathering resources. I just fail to see what's so enjoyable about this kind of the gameplay loop."
3509,"A real fun game for 3-4 people, never expected the game to be this amazing."
3510,It's a fun game with friends but i wish we could come across bigger islands more often
3511,"really good survival game
"
3512,"I've played the game a lot and enjoy the core gameplay, but EVERYTHING off the raft is a huge tedious pain. I restarted playing it to see the recent content, but the obnoxious elements meant I quit before getting to the new stuff. Shark respawns way to fast, so it is always irritating. It isn't challenging or fun, it is just a tedious chore to do. Exploration and ""puzzles"" are all boring and tedious. Surviving on the raft and making resource stops at the smaller islands are great! But play beyond that just gets boring and irritating."
3513,"Simply put, awesome builder with great story and exploration. Good solo but absolutely amazing with friends. Great mod community which makes another play through well worth it. I truly hope that this is just the last chapter of THIS story and not of the game itself. If it is, I hope they decide to make another survival game that is just as enjoyable to play. I highly recommend this game. It may not be perfect but it's damn worth playing."
3514,raft it good
3515,Best way to get left behind by your friends.
3516,"This game is fun in it's own genre.  Some things make sense, others don't.  Some collision mechanics are downright broken.

The most infuriating mechanic of the game is unrecoverable loss of inventory upon death.  Meaning that you can spend a day gathering resources and crafting items, and then one mistake will erase all that effort, not a an ideal scenario for a casual gamer.  I have had to walk away from the game occasionally for a period of time in anger after accidentally jumping into the water with low health and getting murdered by the shark, or getting caught by multiple bears, subsequently losing most of the valuable items in my inventory.

The problem is that this issue has been brought to the developer's tone-deaf ears on multiple occasions, and suggestions were made on how to keep the game challenging without penalizing the player so severely, however, it does not seem like anything will ever change with this regard."

3519,"Raft would be the perfect introduction to gaming for someone who has never stepped into it. 
- Easy to understand
- No min-maxing
- Various difficulties to suit your playstyle/experience
- Short yet enjoyable story

It would basically teach you the basics such as moving in first person point of view, crafting/building, defeating enemies, progressing through simple quests, inventory management, tier progression.

Definitely recommended to play with someone else!

Grab this game if you want to chill with your partner/kids."
3520,"Small Raft: Super cool. Catch shit in the ocean. Have a decent time. Drift to Island: Super cool. Go on boat. Now have sail. Go to island: Super Cool again. Get some shit. Go to another island: not as cool since its the same as the last 2 islands. Google how to start the story. Excited! Start the story. Go to a platform in the ocean. Cool! Go to next story objective. Another island: Cool! Except no food or flowers grow here. Next mission another empty island. You start wondering why you arent playing a better game. Suppress feeling of the game being pretty shit. Go on next empty story island. Repeat a couple of times. See a dome in the next mission island, Cool? No it sucks. Go to apartment buildings: It sucks.

3549,"I really liked this game, and it has many unique features and breathtakingly beautiful story islands, while also providing lots of challenge. There are some minor bugs, but overall these occur very infrequently, and don't pose much of a threat to your worlds. As with any good resource based survival game, there will always be some glitches for duplicating essential items, but stay clear away from them and this game truly becomes an experience to behold. There is also an abundance of characters and extra content to be discovered. I personally have not beaten the game, but i still enjoy every moment."
3550,gute!
3551,This game is amazing. I find myself building and perfecting my raft almost more than following the story.
3552,Great game in its prime or now its kinda like a sandbox game like minecraft but also completely different at the same time
3553,This game for me would be a 5 out of 5 stars because you could be creative and build your raft any way you want and you could paint the raft anything you want. Also if you really want you could go in easy mode and survive on your little raft. And if you want to get hardcore you could go in hard mode which is nice for other people to play in because if you die in the game someone could save you and you would re-spawn in your world. Or you could play it peaceful where nothing wants to get you. Or you could play it in normal mode  and you could play it normally in your game. This game was really fun and challenging. I think people would LOVE this game! Download it and see if you like it!
3554,"This game is shit, all you do is collect items floating at see and try and stop a shark killing you. Its honestly made to waste time.

3604,"The game is fun, to be honest I love the grind for most games, but the sharks in this game on hard difficulty are just annoying as you're constantly trying to repair your boat (not sure if there are more than 3 sharks but right now I'm constantly getting 3, and once I've killed them we get a grace period for a few minutes before they return again). I reckon they should just max it out at 1-2 and just increase the damage. Other than that, the game is great in terms of graphics and story. I have yet to finish the game since it causes my mates to want to delete the game. Despite that, great game do recommend!"

3606,"this game slays so much i cant even put it into words.
i literally played this nonstop with my bff and we had a blast. the start can get a little slow when youre trying to balance out grabbing trash, cooking, mining, etc. but its very peaceful and then when it picks up it gets fun because you get to explore islands and decorate your raft. its super fun 10./10"

3608,Very fun and enjoyable.
3609,"This game needs to be fixed, the attack path of the shark is terrible.  Not to mention the hit-box on the shark is unavoidable.  Please fix the shark, cause I am so unbelievably angry at the fact the shark knows where you're at.  The shark can seem to phase through the island and the raft itself. I really hope you can fix it cause other than the shark it's not a bad game.  All this game needs is to fix the shark and that's all."

There is something for everyone once you get past the initial mad scramble for initial resources. It makes me nostalgic for my childhood playing both The Sims and Age of Empires - it has the building element where you can really flex your imagination combined with a real evolution of skills and supplies and collecting resources. Highly recommend for anyone who likes a slower pace of gameplay but one that really sucks you in for hours on end."

Pretty good survival game - fun and challenging!"

3682,"This game is so satisfying to play.  It can be difficult or easy.  The pacing is great, and once you think you have everything figured out, it adds more for you to learn and explore.  Very easy to loose a few hours that only seem like you've been playing for a few minutes."

3685,"ITS was FUN. Until Someone decided Adding POPUP we need internet connection blah-blah-blah. For Every FEW Minutes. Due to limitations, I can't be online all the time. Why you adding annoying popup like that?"
3686,Pog
3687,Not as expected.
3688,"I know this can be a good game, I know it has it's quirks.  Never have I played a game where I wanted so much to change the controls for individual actions inside of the game because they make no sense.  A great example, lets take the starter plastic cup.

Go to the ocean, what do you use to get sea water?  Why you press the ""E"" button, instead of the mouse button.  Okay, so the cup has to be interacted with, fine. WRONG!  Because all it takes to drink that cup of salt water is to accidentally press your Left mouse button!  Okay, so maybe it is only for getting water out of the ocean?  WRONG!  You use ""E"" or whatever your interact key is to put salt water into the distillery and to get fresh water out, thanks to all the ""E"" training you are wondering why your character is dying of thirst and why pressing ""E"" does not drink the water, except then you realize it is your mouse that preforms that action!

Please for the love of god clean up your control scheme, it is confusing as hell to have them bounce back and fourth on food when that is the one item in the game that will KILL YOU for getting it wrong.  Just put it all on ""E"" instead of swapping to the mouse."
3689,good game
3690,A great game to play with a friend or a few. An amazing game in the end after all chapters were released especially from a small Dev team of 8 people.

3701,"Very fun to play with friends. Don't focus on rushing through the game, enjoy your time and make your raft look nice. Gets a bit tedious when low on resources. Once you max out your raft you should then begin the story, sadly, sailing to each location can take a little. Overall, would recommend."

3722,amazing
3723,Definitely an enjoyable game and fun to play with friends. I love games that let me craft build and explore the world and gives me options for different types of play. Its also nice that I get to have my base float around with me. This is a keeper.
3724,"Well not exactly yes.  I find it just OK. I have played other games like Satisfactory, Subnautica and Zero along with other genre like games. I find this one actually boring and a bit tedious. Not sure if I will finish the game. Maybe later. :)"
3725,Really good game but i can't see my name in the credits section even though i gave you the idea.
3726,"i keep shouting and on my girlfriend that learn how to fish learn how to fish, She ended up being mad and telling me im such a impatient toxic guy 10/10 will never teach someone how to fish again."
3727,"Awesome game experience with my friend.The game is very exciting and challenging ,pretty much a brand new experience definitely worth the price but more exploration and features could be expected in the future. 10/10"
3728,Probably one of if not the best PC game I have every played definitely recommend (much funner with friends)
3729,"Great gameplay, awesome building mechanics and lots and lots of fun:)"
3730,"This game is the shit to play with friends, and the best to get lost in."
3731,leş
3732,"The game and the final chapter was amazing, I thought the ending was super cute. It's a little annoying that you get access to some of the best tools at the literal end of the game, but otherwise, I 100% recommend it."
3733,"This final chapter added so much to the game! The environments are all so varied, raft building is fun, and the story has a satisfying ending. Great mix of chill and exciting."
3734,Good game!
3735,Yea

3739,I only got this game a couple weeks ago and this is my most favourite steam game ever. It is so fun to play. i always join my friends parties and we always go exploring. I would rate Raft a solid 11/10 Best game ever recommend to litteraly anyone ever.

3741,"Tedious, shitty combat, no automation, desyncs over time in coop, durability on fucking everything, food/water ticks too fast,  and all the good shit obtained too late to be of any use for the terrible final boss of box stacking simulator and radioactive hyena."
3742,"I absolutely loved this game in Early Access. I did two full playthroughs (and a YT series) and was so impressed by the sense of adventure and the unique POIs that were in the game. The story was engaging and the world was beautiful (the concept behind the game and the story of its development is so cool). There were issues with it (combat was janky, jumping wasn't great - especially as you have no sense of placement with your feet, and hunger/thirst was a bit on the aggressive side) but the adventure/story/art style/uniqueness made up for it. 

Even though 1.0 adds some very interesting POIs and changes to the story in a unique way, their concepts don't meet up with what is within the framework of the game. They added boss fights which are completely broken. You can be right on top of the enemy and hits won't register, enemies can attack you and hit you from 2-3 feet away from where they actually are and they can attack you through hardcover/high above. It feels incredibly broken. 

Also, the death penalty for solo players is the harshest I have ever seen in a survival game (and not in a good /challenging way). They will destroy 2/3 of your inventory and knock down the durability of all of your tools by 50%. It makes it so it wastes hours of work and you then have to grind several hours more to make up for it. 

In the end, they have some cool concepts but it feels like they started to create one game and decided to switch gears in the end to another type of game. It feels out of place, janky, and overly frustrating to those that are playing solo. It hurts me to say this as I loved this game but the end direction just wasn't the right way of going about this and ruins the overall experience. If you are into creative mode (building without worrying about survival elements) I would recommend jumping into the game for this but otherwise, I cannot recommend the game in the current state."
3743,i give 7 starving men out of 10
3744,Love it.

3746,This game defines the experience of sea adventure and surviving. Recommended for anyone seeking a guide on surviving 2200 sea-level-rising-apocalypse.
3747,"Fun survival style game. I prefer to play on the peaceful mode so I can gather and just view the world, but the next difficulty up with some sense of danger is great to. I highly recommend playing this with friends."

3755,"Any shot at an expansion?

Great game.  Beat it on peaceful and the last 2 zones did not feel peaceful but overall loved the experience.  Would love to see more growth on the story or technology."
3756,"A chill, although kind of boring, survival game. Decent for a more calmer ""survival"" experience. Was all right with my buddy but playing solo was boring and horrible. My raft got stuck on a large island, which arrived way sooner in my solo play than in my multiplayer play (assuming it's random). But my raft got lodged onto the island. I explored it, got a bunch of stuff, but a large bird (I'm assuming it's a Roc) kept dropping rocks on me, even while I was trying to paddle to break free from the island. The Roc was relentless and I lost all of my inventory. By this point I had not researched how to make a bow and so only had a spear, so I couldn't even fight back. Was a very frustrating way to die, especially when everything had been going so smoothly up to that point. Roc's agro should stop once you leave the island. For how lackluster the game itself is, can't recommend anyone buying it if it has bs things like that in it."

3767,raft rearranged is fart
3768,Very enjoyable game
3769,This Waterworld game is pretty good
3770,"I think Raft at it's core is the ultimate challenge in resource management. You spawn on a tiny raft drifting through the endless waters, all you have is a hook, debris, and some wood to keep you afloat. You have to treasure every item because if one sinks into the water, there is no way to replace it. As you carefully navigate your absurd circumstance, you gain a new appreciation for the few things you have as you meticulously use them to their fullest affect. With nothing but some barrels, plastics, and wood; you slowly transform this empty expanse into a world of your very own. 

Raft teaches us that no matter how ridiculous the odds may seem, within us resides the power to overcome these challenges and achieve something beautiful. That one day we'll look back at where we've started and be amazed by how far we've come."
3771,mauh
3772,"It's to play solo but you can also play with friends, also a good pass time."
3773,boat
3774,very fun game many hours of fun even more fun with friends the ending wasn't the best but it was still good
3775,It is a slow game at the start but after a while it starts to speed up a bit. Though I am playing with my friend and we can't get to the first point which is the radio tower. But that is because of the wind currents. Overall a great game!
3776,"It's addictive! 
Pros:
+Open world
+Relaxing ocean view
+Unleash your creativity by designing your own raft. Wanna make a tropical paradise floating on the ocean? Or small simple scuttleship? A floating city? A jungle playground raft? Or maybe a warship? A Pirate themed ship? It's all up to you!
+Ever changing ever moving boat that moves toward the blue unknown. I love the feeling of journey.

Cons:
-Gathering resource can be VERY CHALLENGING, TIME CONSUMING AND TIDIOUS for beginner. Seriously. You've been warned.
-Food and drink needs drained a bit too fast, they need to slow it down a bit.
-Early gameplay will be confusing for beginners since you'll be confused on where and what to gather material from.
-Ocean physics/character detailed graphic needs to be updated, maybe like Sea of Thieves. Not too realistic and not too cartoonish.
-Shark is very annoying especially if they disturb your resource gathering under water. 

Recommended if:
You like survival, open world, ocean, swimming, creativity, island hopping, adventuring."

3792,"Had a blast playing multiplayer. The Last Chapter had fun and somewhat challenging puzzles. The ending made me chuckle. New vending machine items are a great touch for customizing your raft. 

Sail on dirty Rafters! <3"
3793,overrated af
3794,very gud
3795,"Had such a blast playing the game. Fun to sail around and build up your raft, how you play is up to you. The plot progression keeps gameplay fresh and gives you something to work towards. Even after 'beating the game' you can continue to sail around and continue building up your raft until you're satisfied. Would recommend to anyone who likes survival & farming/harvesting style games."
3796,"very fun, what else can i say?"
3797,Good
3798,this game is one of the only 10/10 games i have played. The game play was fantastic and so was the story.
3799,"I've been paying attention to Raft for a very long time, and I must say that Axolotl really knows what they're doing when they create a good game. Great Co-Op, great story, great mechanics, great everything. Wonderful for anyone of any age and a great foundation for people with little understanding of game mechanics willing to take that step to develop more advanced gaming ability!"
3800,"WARNING!! MINOR SPOILERS

 This one gets a thumbs up in my book, especially when compared to the wave of poorly produced ""survival+craft"" games doing their best to imitate ""The Forest"".  The grind itself isn't nearly as bad as other games in the genre, it became bothersome for ME, but that was my own doing (my raft became a skyscraper of tree plots).  However, I have a serious problem with this game that must first be addressed.

 I recently pillaged a cruise ship and received a blueprint for a motor.  You've officially put an engine on this pile of plastic bottles that's also made of shark bait....  

 That's not a raft, it's a dinghy. possibly a pontoon if built correctly.  Or a coconut skyscraper with a motor on it, whatever, just DO SOMETHING ABOUT THIS INJUSTICE!!!

3810,"I've enjoyed this game a lot, and my kids enjoy the peaceful mode as an alternative to minecraft. Up until recently I had been recommending it to friends - but not anymore. I encountered a recurring health drain issue after a puffer fish exploded next to me - health stops going down, seconds later it's draining again. Until I died - now the issue I had is that EVERY save is overwritten to just before I die, meaning that to progress I have to take the 2/3 loss of everything - EVERYTHING, inventory, gear, tools. The loss even seems to extend to my chests on my raft, which must be a bug?!. Now I'm prepared for death penalties and I'm prepared for a continuous save - I play 7 days most of the time! But when it's a hidden mechanic, that is also buggy, it smacks more of designers presuming to tell me how to play the game, rather than me choosing how to. And that is a warning sign to me. So right now, I wouldn't recommend the game."
3811,"fun game

3812,"Raft is peaceful once you have an indestructible raft and can ignore the shark lol. Love the music and ambiance, story is fun and engaging, but I do wish there was more to do post main story."

You don't really need to have a NASA PC to enjoy the game, and I think it's a game most people should have. You might not wanna pay full price to it but should a small sale should be enough to reconsider buying it."

3839,"Friends forced me to get this game. I was skeptical because I typically don't enjoy survival games, and later realized I had mistaken this game for Stranded Deep, which is a farce of a game.

Starting off was confusing, I struggled to even figure out how to purify water, but fast forward one day and I'm having a blast. I naturally donned the coat of master architect in our group and was in charge of designing our raft layout. Took us a while to even realize there's a story in the game and that's when things really took off.

I don't think it's your typical survival game and that's likely why I loved it. The combat is limited and usually initiated by choice, and the health/hunger/thirst management is fairly forgiving and straightforward unlike my previous experiences with survival games.

I really like how the game has a relaxing sailing phase where you can chat with friends and kick back, and then eventually you reach an island and go all Christopher Columbus on it."

3868,"It's a catchy game, graphics are poor and there are some glitches but the game play is nice, challenging and the various world types make it easy for the beginner to test the various features like building. It's loading very fast, saving is fast but there is only one saved game (the latest). The story is nice but it's also very pleasant just to visit the various locations, scavenge the island and reefs.
Most important feature for me is the raft building. There are so many things you can try. The game has a huge mod support."

3872,Great survival game. Fun and not repetitive. Multiplayer feature is great and makes for some funny moments with friends. Easy to learn too.
3873,"A good mix of zen building and survival (depending on difficulty). Even more enjoyable with a few friends and the shenanigans that entails. Recent updates have added a more fleshed out story, voiceacting, new technology and heaps of collectibles to decorate your raft with."
3874,i liked the expanding raft
3875,"I think Raft is a really good game, as a single player it can get a bit grindy and repetitive, not enough to put me off personally, but if you play with friends progression runs a lot smoother. 
There is a good amount of things to do, crafting, collecting, farming, livestock care, exploring, puzzles, pve and ofc designing and decorating your raft. 
There is a storyline to follow involving tasks which, if I'm totally honest, gets a bit out of character towards the end but the main part of the game for me is sailing around peacefully on my raft exploring and gathering and making my raft feel 'homely' and to that end I find raft very relaxing and enjoyable. :)
I'm coming up to the last chapter in the storyline and I really wish it didn't have like a set end in sight ... maybe I'll never sail there. :)"
3876,My friend is scared of the ocean. Great horror game
3877,gud game
3878,"I have had a love hate relationship with this game. I got it in early access before the story. and whilst there was only so much to do. I really enjoyed the chill, isolated vibe. Where you must stay alive and make life comfortable. but as the game has progressed although the story and new stuff for your raft is a welcome addition the chill isolation has descended into a slaughter fest boss battle platformer. After playing half the game of building out your raft, painting it, decorating it and becoming almost self sufficient. The late game drags you into a dystopian mad max. killing spree. as the chapters progress you suddenly get a boss fight then another and another with a platformer in between. who in there right mind wants that after 20 or so hours of painting and farming. and if you do. Do you want to wait for 20 hours of painting and farming to get to your bit of the game. the late game seems so jarringly at odds with the first half. knowing what I know now I don't think I would have bought it in the first place. so all in all a really good survival builder game that loses it's way at endgame."

3891,This fun and good to play with friends.
3892,"This game is really fun. The story line is well thought through and is very clever,funny and interesting. I really recommend you play Raft if you like chill survival games."
3893,This game was awesome. I especially enjoyed hunting all the achievements and getting 100% of the game done.
3894,"[h1]TL;DR:[/h1]
Come for the gameplay, skip the story. The core game of sailing on a vast expanse of ocean, hauling in resources and building up your raft is compelling and addictive time-sink. However, it's spoiled by the uneven story, technological pacing, and some frankly bizarre gameplay decisions towards the end of the game. I personally enjoyed it enough to stick with it, but it won't be for everyone - especially for those who (1) aren't good at platforming and/or (2) have no patience for janky movement controls. For those who are on the fence, get it on sale.

[h1]Pros:[/h1]
[list]
    [*]Collecting resources and building up your raft is surprisingly enjoyable.
    [*]Excellent early and midgame with a focus on survival
    [*]An interesting premise compared to other survival games on the market
    [*]Good graphics and soundtrack
[/list]
[h1]Cons:[/h1]
[list]
    [*]Extremely uneven pacing throughout the game
    [*]Disappointing story - you can pinpoint *exactly* when the devs decided to rush it out of early access
    [*]Grind-heavy past mid-game with illogical resource sinks
    [*]Janky controls and physics
[/list]
[h1]Explanation:[/h1]
[b]Warning: Unmarked spoilers below[/b]
Raft started off as a concept from a game jam a while ago, and between then and now received a series of updates: more gameplay, better graphics, and a story to go with it. It also went through a large story revision midway, with the developers changing and streamlining the story to fit their purposes. For most part, the game is entertaining and keeps you hooked for a while, but once you reach the end of the story, unlike other survival games in the genre, there isn't much keeping you going.

I found the game quite enjoyable from early game to mid-game. The early game is challenging, especially when you have nothing but a plastic hook, a plastic cup, and a few beets and potatoes to your name. It also starts off as your typical survival game: expand your base, get more machines, manage your food and hunger. 

Manging the shark attacks and exploring islands add some much-needed spice to the core loop, although some will find it annoying to fend off the shark, especially if your spear breaks. Keeping an eye for shark attacks while trying to expand my raft and craft the increasing amount of items the game throws at you is an exercise in time management and resource management, but the gameplay loop is interesting enough that it draws you in.

The world map is a mix between procedurally generated islands and some handcrafted story islands. The initial story islands are also interesting as well. You're compelled to explore and locate more of the co-ordinates the game gives you, and the early to mid-game story locations are clearly crafted with care.

The raft-building system is also quite extensive: players are given the option to build mostly how they want, paint what they want, and there's a fairly robust variety of options to renovate and build. You can go as simple or as complex as you like, and building a raft to how you want it to look is really half the fun. If you have a peep at the Discord or the Reddit page of the game, you'll see some impressive builds that people have come up with.

However, once you get past early and mid game, there will be several issues that start to appear. First is the hunger/thirst system. Raft deals with hunger/thirst by not only taking into account how much the food fills you up, but also how hungry/thirsty you are when you eat. It makes for frustrating gameplay: the hungrier you are, the less you need to eat to get your hunger bar up; but if your character is full, you have to eat more to fill up the hunger bar.

The procedurally generated islands also manage to somewhat avoid the issue of looking the ""same"", as the islands are divided into different biomes and sizes. However, it isn't enough to rescue them from being dull, as the resources you find are extremely similar across the different biome islands, though it does mean you rely less on RNG to find the resources to expand your raft.

The predictability of the islands is a good thing, because the game gets extremely grindy past mid-game. The technology you need to build requires more and more resources that you've gathered, and results in some illogical decisions. For example, using the cooking pot yields only one dish that you need a clay bowl in, and when you consume the dish, you also consume the bowl, meaning you need to find more clay to continue cooking. While the developers probably intended this to be a resource sink (as clay is barely used past a few builds), it doesn't make sense. There are several more poorly-implemented resource sinks which could've used some balancing.

The pacing of the upgrades given to you are also very uneven. For example, you're not given an automated anchor system until the penultimate location, despite obtaining the upgrade to control said automated anchor in early mid-game. You also get the best weapons once you finish the story, giving you very little reason to use it save for bragging rights. 

You can also  see exactly when the developers decided to rush this game out of early access, whether because they want to move on or because they ran out of funds. The subsequent story islands lose the handcrafted feeling past Chapter 2, and seem like the developers wanted to move onto a new project quickly without considering the time needed to fully flesh the story they wanted to tell out. Between the rushed final Chapter 3 and the strange pacing of upgrades, it feels as if the game needed at least a Chapter 4 to fully utilise the upgrades we'd been given at the end of Chapter 3.

There's also a massive shift in game focus. Raft originally was intended to be a survival game, but it seems halfway through the developers wanted to add in action and platforming elements - including boss fights in certain locations. In itself, it wouldn't be a problem. However, the controls and physics in game, together with some of the bugs with regards to spawning creatures and hitboxes mean that it makes for an unenjoyable and janky platforming experience. Raft would have been better served skipping the action and making more use of its puzzles to gate progress.

Finally, the game offers a solo player or multi-player experience, and in three different game modes: peaceful, normal, hard. I haven't played on Hard yet, and don't intend to. Peaceful Mode is a misnomer, as you can't skip the boss fights. However, the game is particularly harsh on a solo player on Normal mode. If you run out of health on Normal Mode, you're incapacitated and need to be rescued. If no one rescues you, [b]you lose two thirds of your inventory on respawn[/b] (i.e. possibly hours of grind). The game also saves when you are incapacitated, meaning even if you exit the world, when you log back in, you remain incapacitated unless you give in and respawn. As a solo player, if no one rescues you, you take the loss. There's no no tombstone for you to retrieve your lost items either (unless you mod it in).

The use of mods will alleviate a lot of this: from the illogical resource sinks, to having tombstones to pick up your lost items, to several quality of life fixes. However, a game should never have to rely on mods to fix their issues.

It'd be unfair of me to give this game a ""Not Recommended"", because I played 50+ hours of it and very much enjoyed it, warts and all. I certainly don't regret buying in their early access, because they delivered on their core gameplay loop. However, there are several points in the game that will be a game breaker for a lot of new players, and it's clear the developers rushed the last Chapter when it could have benefited from at least another chapter's worth of fleshing out."
3895,Absolutely amazing game.
3896,"Raft is the best game to play with your friends. Except the huge ammount of things you can do there, there are a lot of things you can learn from it. It is 100% worth and I totally recommend it!"
3897,this game is fun and I didn't think that my laptop could handle it but it did
3898,"w game
"
3899,"i love it, would recommend to everyone. i have recommended to many ppl actually he he"
3900,"Bad 
Not
Fun
So
Fucking
Boring"
3901,Super addicting! Basically Rust without PvP
3902,"The shark is a little annoying but i guess it is there for a reason.. it attacks and destroys your raft if you let it, always have a weapon, no real torturial but hey it is a great game with hours of fun for you and your kids."
3903,"bro i love this game. it's so easy to just sit down and let your brain assimilate into the ocean waves as you mindlessly collect materials. i dont even know the lore, i just like making boat bigger"
3904,"Great game!
If you can get over the constantly gathering materials and making food this game is awesome. After a few hours you start to gather stuff faster and faster and then the game comes naturally. 

The story-line isnt something you're gonna wanna play over and over again but the aspect of making a raft and exploring for materials didn't get as boring as I thought. I can totally see myself coming back to this game from time to time when I wanna make a raft! + having friends for this game can help but a solo run is just as enjoyable"
3905,PHENOMINAL GAME to play with friends. would not recommend single player. single player it's quite a slow and grindy experience but when you play with friends it make gathering materials a lot faster and you can actually start getting places a lot faster.
3906,"shark bite, me attack shark, shark die, sad i have no more shark friend, SHARK COME BACK, me and shark become buddys again, SHARK ATTACK ME, me attack shark."
3907,"The journey has been completed. I agree with others that the ending really blunts the progression of the experience and have to really think hard about an up or downvote.

I'm gonna inch it over to an upvote because the crew I had were amazing but really would put this in the neutral territory. It's got a lot of fun going for it which should be experienced as long as you brace yourself for the pacing issues with progression and absolute let down of an ending."
3908,Very fun with cool puzzles
3909,THE SUPER YACHT IS SCARY!
3910,"A game that is not a platform, devolving into a series of jumping puzzles for the finale, is completely idiotic and ruins the experience of what is a survival game."
3911,"Top four complaints about this game:
[list]
[*] Bizarrely inconsistent rules about how planting works. How do you get more potatoes? You plant a potato, obviously. How do you get more watermelons? Plant a watermelon? Don't be stupid, you need watermelon [i]seeds[/i], which of course you can't get from a watermelon. Obviously.

[*] A lot of unnecessarily punishing resource consumption mechanics. To make honey, you need a glass jar to put the honey in, which requires glass. Fine. Then when you [i]use[/i] the honey, the glass jar is gone forever. So you have to permanently consume glass to get honey.

[*] Some truly awful puzzles, the [i]least[/i] of which are the jumping puzzles.

[*] Weird, tricky multiplayer desync issues.
[/list]

Ultimately, I can forgive those problems. What really bugs me about this game is that [i]everything[/i] has durability, and [i]you can't repair items[/i]. You just have to use things until they break and disappear, and carry spares of everything around. Tremendously obnoxious.

I'm gonna beat it anyways because suffering is still fun when you're suffering with friends, but there's better options out there in the genre."
3912,"This game is great if you have friends to play it with wether your just vining or screwing around this game is great I highly recommend it. 

Also, balls"
3913,"W game genuinely fun when bored
"
3914,"shark boobs


gggg"
3915,"Think Subnautica, now slap yourself and think about raft. 
Through glorious conquest I killed multiple sharks and robbed and entire cruise ship.
Ery noice."
3916,nooooo moooooore co-op
3917,"good gam
"
3918,sheeeeee good game
3919,"My ex - wife told me to play this game with her, she then abandons me on the raft instead. 11/10 will play again."
3920,Fun with friends
3921,good game
3922,"This game worth this price,even though this game came out from 2017 with beta but their teams keep updating the game with new excited content.Their passion and love put on this game really worth the price.Although they are only small team but the updates they had done are way more better than the 3A developed game.Believed me ,this game deserved the price even more higher price."
3923,Now that the final update has come out for the game i can safely say that this is a great game with around 24 hours worth of gameplay if you were to play it all the way through while trying to build up your raft as you go. The one thing I wish they would add that would completely change the game and add many hours of playability in it is by adding side quests. this would be as simple as adding in random characters to some of the larger islands that will ask you to accomplish different tasks and give you items as a reward. This could also be a way to earn reputation points that can be used at trader outposts as currently the only way to do this is through fishing. If they were to only keep It at the current amount of Islands they should add the upgraded tools to the trader outposts as well so that people can try to get them before they finish the game as currently you only get them upon completion when there is not much reason to have them.
3924,pretty gud
3925,sooooooooooper fun with friends
3926,Enjoyable multiplayer survival experience!
3927,its good but it feels like im going to die from sodium poisoning because i dirk salt water for immersion
3928,Awesome game if you wanna just turn your brain off. It's on the relaxing side of a grindy game. But I have a problem trying to use the recycler. Is there a way you could make it so that I could just put a whole stack of mats instead of pressing my e so much! Please make it happen devs!
3929,uwu
3930,"Fun game, interesting mechanics and a beautiful environment."
3931,Really perfect co-op survival game! <3
3932,fuck the sharkl
3933,Very fun game to play with friends!
3934,yes
3935,"Heavy on resource-collecting, but also delivers some of the best base-building aesthetics I've ever seen.
For instance, you can put a 3-octave playable piano on your raft. And string lights. And planters. So many plants and planters.

Overall a very relaxing experience.
Don't you worry. We'll all float on, alright?"

3937,"really fun game to play on your free time,I like the open seas and also sometimes sailing by the islands when I started.  A game most steam users should get."
3938,"Playing this four person with the spouse, 16 year old, and 10 year old, and everyone loves it.  Multiplayer works great."
3939,"loving Playing this game. even for a beginner it is not too difficult. i like being able to turn off the sharks and animal attacks as well. i finally learned how to make an anchor as well, dont eat your first potato either plantt it and the beet you get as you get 2 for each 1 you plant."
3940,Fun for both the actual game and trolling friends
3941,"The game is really fun to play 
"
3942,cool game
3943,I'm having a lot of fun in this game so far and I haven't even started the story line yet because I'm still gathering things but this is a very awesome game! :)

3946,fun game to play with friends
3947,ITS AMAZING
3948,"Raft is a neat concept with a cool setting and a functional engine. Unfortunately, its core is tedious. Like many games, you begin by gathering basic resources in a simple manner. Unlike better games, you continue to do this throughout the game because increases in automation and efficiency are extremely limited. I say this having played on the least demanding mode for hunger and thirst -- other settings will make the problem even more severe. Without substantial base building or deep combat, the game has to be carried by its setting, story, and exploration, and while they're all fine they aren't up to the task."
3949,This is undeniably my favourite game at the moment - it’s so much fun to play by yourself or with others - endless hours of fun and entertainment!
3950,hi
3951,great game play along with a great story line
3952,"Definitely a good game with friends. Build, scavenge and dont get your cheeks bit by the shark. Love it lol"
3953,amazing game 10/10
3954,sharks are stinky.
3955,"I love survival craft and this one is fun, it's a different take with the water world type vibe.  Doing the story gives you and objective which I like.  It's more simplistic than other survival games but still enough to do without it feeling too grindy.  The hunger and thirst is a little ridiculousIMO on normal so I enjoy the game more on easy."
3956,yep
3957,"fav survival game
tbh RAFT>MINECRAFT"
3958,fun to get destroyed by shark and die of thirst
3959,"I have been floating for days now. Food and water run low and no matter how hard I try, keeping stock is futile.  The birds....the birds where do they come from? They are always above always eating my plants. Then there is the shark. The predator and I am its prey. I must make landfall soon, to replenish valuable supplies....Land...LAND!!!...I am sav...(sounds of a bird screech and a boulder dropping onto a raft with a wet crunch)

Great game. I love it."

3982,"Just finished the full story, honestly quite incredible. Went through the whole world save with 3 other friends and we could all say that we got our money's worth for this game. The last island is a little bit underwhelming after all the dramatic build up (the bossfight was not as hyped/creative as the Varuna Point's shark mechanics) which could use some tune up but overall, it is a very enjoyable game. Thank you devs for sticking with the community this far and sending out a great product. :)"

"
3988,"On ""Normal"" difficulty.

The sheer number of times you have to stab a shark or a Ram is just ridiculous.  There is no dodge, only death.  After you kill a shark(while near a land mass) you have approx. 90 seconds to dive in the water and get what you want before another shows up.

This is probably one of those games where people ONLY play in sandbox mode to see what kind of floating garbage city they can create.  If your mom pays all your bills and you have no life, you'll probably enjoy this."

3993,good game
3994,"Raft, Is a fantastic Survival game from start to finish. The story is wonderful. The areas are sometimes hard to get through. But It is a blast, alone or with friends. My only hope is that they eventually add even more content but from what I understand the game is fully completed at this point. But it is for sure a gem that I will return to from time to time just to enjoy the relaxing nature of it all. 
Worth the full price, or on sale. 10/10 Would recommend. 
Starting out can be a little rough, but it's worth getting through because once you do. And the story begins to unfold. You will get hooked just like I did."
3995,"This is extremely fun! There is a constant presence of the unknown, and the curiosity that follows that is what drives you. This game is awesome alone, but, in my opinion at least, is better with friends. The developers put a lot of effort in to this game and it shows. I sincerely think that anyone having thoughts about buying this game should."

I'm unable to play any world for longer than 15 minutes, because my raft simply disappears, or floats through an island where it gets stuck, or because of some other game-breaking bug, of which there are countless.

i don't understand why the final level was platforming and puzzles rather than mechanics based around your raft. the snow area with the vehicles was cool, but didn't feel like it made sense to be in this game...

EVERYTHING has durability, for some reason. its very annoying, monotonous and uninteresting.

though... i'm unsure if i regret playing Raft--that's the most positive thing i feel like i can say.

After completing the story and playing for 40 hrs I'd generalize this as a kind of chill Subnautica. I was gifted this by a friend, but at the current price point I'd still say it's 100% worth."
4033,nice game
4034,Fun with friends!
4035,I thought about uninstalling and getting a refund after the first hour. After sleeping on it for a day I came back and now I love it.
4036,buy it you wont regret it lolll

I used to play it a lot by myself back when i first got it, and now i came back when i heard there was new update, found a group and had even more fun. Even tho the ending was little underwhelming the journey with friends was super fun. Love seeing all different designs and ideas my friends have, so many creative people here. :D 
Definitely recommend this game. [spoiler] But careful, its very addicting. XD [/spoiler]"

4068,"Me and my friend played this game from its release. We liked the essence of the world this game tried to present, Spent a lot of time building a raft to our liking. Finally completed the story. Hopefully some more engaging DLCs are made by the creators. Will be one of the many fans waiting for that day"
4069,"Great game to play with mates, 10/10"

4071,"This game is aight. 4-5/10.

I played this game with a friend. We had a lot of fun the first 1/3 of the game then it got progressively stale and uninspired. 

Positives:
-Challenging in the beginning (we played on hard)
-It is co op and the co op works well.
-Surviving in the beginning is intense and fun.
-There are a few quite interesting islands.
-There is a good amount of items to unlock in the early and mid game.
-You build your own ship!!!
-Relatively cheap, probably worth its price. Maybe.

Negatives:
-Combat is dogshit and exists just for the sake of being there. It is too clunky for me to say that it at least serves its purpose. 
-The end game is quite lacking. I was really hoping for solar panels to automise some machines, but you can never do that. It feels like the last 1/4th of the game is missing in terms of progression.
-The game gets boring in the last 1/3rd. Surviving is now a chore, doing the same things over and over. The last late game machines and recipes help with that but they come too late.
-There aren't enough unique islands. You will see every possible island variation too soon (around half way, excluding the story islands)
-BIGGEST PROBLEM: The second half of the game is uninspired and rushed. 
       -The puzzels are pretty bad and boring. Most of them repeat. Look around, find these items, go back.
       -The story islands are interesting visually, but are a bore in terms of gameplay. 
       -There aren't enough interesting things/items to find.
       -There is a lack of late game progression/survival. The game becomes going from one story island to the next. You are barely incentivised to discover new regular islands. This could be fixed by adding new regular islands after you get to the 4-5th story island that contains materials for late game machines, like solar panels, a submarine, permanent diving gear, a modern weapon etc. Those regular island could contain the materials for these machines and gear.

Conclusion: Fun and challenging the first half, unique (you got a raft!), interesting story islands visually; terrible combat, rushed and uninspired second half and lack of endgame."

4084,This game is amazing and it is very fun with friends.
4085,"Raft is a wonderful game that is even better when played with friends. This game grabbed my group and I from the beginning and we were eager to see what the new islands would tell us about the strange world of Raft. It has a semi-guided story that guides you gently along the story path, but also still allows you to explore as much as you want. The lore and background of the world are also very mysterious and exciting to learn about. 

When we completed the story, we were sad to say that we were done. 

9/10 solo
10/10 with friends 

Well done, Redbeet Interactive."

4097,Really fun game. Highly recommend
4098,"Love this game, for a survival game, it doesn't really ever get boring. The only thing I wished that there was are different sharks available to attack your raft with a different gameplay mechanic for each after you killed whichever shark was present. It would've been dope for example to have a hammerhead shark go after your catching nets if you had them. Would make the game so much funner instead of having the same old Great White Shark coming after you each and every time."
4099,nice game for play with friends
4100,"fun basic game play loop of gathering and building, plus interesting story locations that you can tackle at your own pace. Best of both worlds in a survival game.

Plus organising and optimising the inventory is just SO satisfying"
4101,"water
"
4102,"it is great
"
4103,"This is a fun and simplistic survival game that is better played with friends (for fun) or solo (for base building). The construction is surprisingly precise, and allows you quite a bit more freedom than you would expect. It is a bit slow sometimes when island generation isn't in your favor but it's usually pretty fair. It is a bit lacking in content, but for the price I think it's pretty fair.

Like most survival games unfortunately, the difficulty does fall off very quickly and once you get past the beginning (especially if you know what you're doing with nets, fishing and the research table) you can more or less trivialize any risk the game throws at you within the first hour and snowball the rest forever, especially solo (which in my opinion, is significantly easier due to not needing to share food/water."
4104,"very fun game, has more going on than it first appears with alot of interesting stuf to do and find - say 'hi' to Bruce !"
4105,"honestly not good

4112,"The game itself is amazing, I really do like the calm and collective experience, its like a lot of other games.

But one problem I do have with it is that I don't like how hard it is in single player, i shouldn't have to lose more than half of my inventory just because i was starving, going back to my boat, and got hit by the fucking bird. And no one was there to rescue me. Sharks eating my raft, birds eating my food, big birds destroying my skull. And thing is, people are just like ""ohh get friends"" or ""ohh its a co op game"" but I like playing by myself. I'm not saying change the entire game to fit multiplayer, but i'm just saying that single player is really, really hard, and i'm not playing this anymore."

4121,addicting as fuck
4122,"Been playing Raft since it's release. Always started a new game when new content came out. We finally have the end content! It's a been a long journey, but worth it! If you like open-world/crafting/survival games, this is a must have. Raft is one of the few games that is equally enjoyable when played solo or in a group. Beautiful graphics, great game-play and lots of replayability."
4123,water. raft. story. fun
4124,At first glance this game seem like any other sandbox/survival game. but as soon as we progress the story. it's get more mind blowing what this game archived. I really wish there's more content. Nevertheless this is really fun and chill game to play with your friend
4125,"NOT AT ALL REALISTIC! AND IT'S BRILLIANT!

You start off, you die... you start again, you die again...

Eventually though, you stop dying and you start figuring out what you have to do.

Nice steady progression, brilliant sandbox building. Great engaging story...

Only one problem... you never want to stop. You know at some point you need to save and turn it off, but you don't want to, you want to explore 1 more island, or kill one more shark, or dive 1 more coral reef. I'm 30 hours in and I'm loving it.

9.8/10 love it!

4145,"Having now finished the game, I can certainly recommend this. It's a very chilled out experience from start to finish.

As mentioned by other folks, combat is a bit janky and weird feeling. But isn't the main part of the game, so isn't a big worry. Sharks are super frustrating at points as well on hard mode. 

Would great if there was more story/islands to explore after ending. So I do hope they come back for an expansion at some point.

Otherwise a great game to play with friends, explore and have a good time learning about the world and characters."

4159,josh get the game
4160,"Very tentative recommendation.

Best part of the game is you have a lot of freedom in building your raft. If you're really into base design you might like that.

The core gameplay loop isn't extremely good, but pretty enjoyable and relaxing all the same.

If you're playing for the story, some techs unlock way way too late. You'll use them like once, or not at all. Worst offender is the [spoiler] advanced anchor [/spoiler] which really should unlock a few islands earlier."
4161,a nice survival game with the ability to build on water

New animals to fight, better weapons to help, and the opportunity to build your Raft into something bigger than you'd ever think. Highly recommend, I've enjoyed every moment on this game and even the story is a lot of fun to follow."

4182,"When i first got this game it was pretty barebones, me and my friends would run out of things to do pretty fast, Im happy to say now, that despite all the pressure put on the devs from how the game blew up on youtube, they have managed to escape from the crappy indie game trap, and now with the final chapter, you can build your raft in so many ways that you cant get bored easily, plus now that the story is finished, i think Raft has lived up to expectations."
4183,Decent game with Minecraft vibes as well as Sea of Thieves vibes without the tryhards. Fun time killer
4184,D
4185,Very fun game! Is recommended that you play with other people though
4186,actually this raft more more like a home once you get on into it and become immersed and calling it a raft is putting it down making anything a boat and more a home.

Yeah, Yeah

Yeaaah

In the ocean blue
Never thought I knew
All the ways that this could get worse

4194,One of the best games I've ever played. Highly recommend I'm addicted
4195,"Raft is tricky to review. The initial loop of gather, expand, and explore is excellent. The first half of the game is a ton of fun and one of the best survival games out there. Then it turns into a terrible game.
Problem is that the developers seemingly forgot they were making a survival game halfway through and tried to become a point and click puzzle game with combat. The islands start getting to big, the puzzles are boring, and the game starts to become tedious. You'll end up getting new technology too late for it to be worth using. 
As you play it also become apparent that the game has some severe flaws in the tech tree that detract from it. You never really get past needing to farm large amounts of seaweed and metal. It really feels like there is an early plastic tier, an early game plastic tier, and this end game tier that isn't worth using.
By the end of this game you'll feel it went on for 8 hours too long. It really could have used more time in early access. There should have been less focus on adding low quality story islands and more focus on the core of the game."
4196,"i got eaten by a shark, would reccomentdsadasdasfsdfa. Very good game"
4197,bad

4200,very fun game
4201,a lot of  fun
4202,"Can't imagine playing this singleplayer, co-op feels like a must.  Building a raft and scavenging on islands feels super rewarding, but the ""chapters"" feel totally misplaced.  Weird, frustrating puzzles and awkward boss fights.  Still a fun game."
4203,"So many ways to enjoy this little game... peaceful, drifting, collecting, gathering with occasional bouts of puzzles and gentle combat all the way up to crazy, difficult and scary.  Any way you choose to play, the story is compelling, the puzzles are not so intricate that you get frustrated, and, unless you just totally HATE time management and multi-tasking, you will enjoy this experience.  Be warned, however, that the need to multi-task and keep constant vigilance both against Bruce (your ever constant shark 'companion') and in the care of your plants, animals, raft, and surroundings can get overwhelming if you're not prepared.  Just breathe, and head for the stream if you need a break.  Move with the wind and gather and do a bit of building and relax.  Lovely days."

4222,"As a veteran of crafting/survival games, I found many fresh ideas here that build on the established systems. The game still needs more content obviously, but it's now in a state where it's worth the asking price without any second thinking. Sure there are some better options out there, such as Subnautica... but this is a nice entry level into the genre that I would recommend for those wanting to dip their feet in the water.

GRAPHICS:
Cartoon style art, functions as you would expect without performance issues but suffers from looking a tad bland especially on islands. (don't expect Sea of Thieves grade quality but it doesnt detract from gameplay) 6/10.

GAMEPLAY:
Covers most of the genre features you would expect, grind for materials, upgrade systems, craft better stuff etc. No real issues in the gameplay or mechanics but it's fairly lightweight for a crafting game without being too basic, while at the same time many will find a hundred hours of fun building up an epic free-form ship from the basic raft you start off with. 7.5/10

AUDIO:
It does the job, nothing really more to say about it, some of the tunes will grate, but most people will slap on their own tunes anyway. 5/10.

OVERALL:
I would call it one of the better options for people new to this type of game, and the co-op play is good and stable. 7.5/10

4232,good
4233,"Interesting premise that feels severely undercooked and unfinished at many parts.

There's virtually no danger of starvation or any of the predators in this game, and if you follow the main story along you'll be preoccupied with fetching items and solving menial puzzles that make you run around way too much while you refill your needs every few minutes.

The visuals and building aspect are quite decent, if it weren't for a severe lack of resources to build anything big, and the process of going through collecting more is just way too tedious to bother with, especially since there is no gameplay reason to do any of it while being clunky to manage the inventory."

It's nice to have someone who knows what they are doing, but it's not a must and can learn together! I had no knowledge in the game, now I love being the one in charge of making food/drinks AND creating home/decorating >:D and bf works on the industrial related stuff :P We just finished the story not too long ago, but still continuing on to slowly improve our home~! And also unlocking all the other characters you could unlock :3 I love seeing the fishies in the sea~ even though you can't capture them it was nice to swim along with them~ I hope one day we can have fish tank to from all the fishes we captured OwO/  The only sad thing I have to say is be careful of animal that might glitch and/or clipped into the ground...sadly I had an incident where I found a rare pink dodo and when I accidentally dropped it, it was nowhere to be seen ;n; I looked over the island for over 20 mins hoping I can find it again, but even relog didn't help ;n;  that was my own sad moment in the game. But otherwise I really do recommend giving this game a shot~ I have more fun with others, than alone, but that is just me~ This game can be play by yourself or with friends :3"

4275,"I've been playing this game for awhile now. Every time a new update comes out I restart just to get a taste of the sea from the humble beginnings.

We haven't completed it yet, but my friends and I will soon. Obviously can't complete the story without the whole crew."
4276,Fun concept to begin with but they actually added new content im excited to play it more
4277,"I've got over two hundred hours logged in this, about half of that was early access.  It's a great simple survival game.  It's not too complicated, so if you're new to survival games it shouldn't be difficult to grasp and it's pretty relaxing once you get past the early game.  Excitement comes at your pace rather than unexpectedly.  I'd highly recommend it even at twice the price."

4304,"just picked the game up a week or two ago, and yeah. as is apparent by my 42 hours in the game i like it a LOT. the story is intriguing, creative mode is fun to play around in, and it's just really fun. if you find fun in resource management, organization, and the creativity that comes with building your raft, i recommend a download. i even play the game SOLO and have fun, which says a lot. i'm sure it's even more fun with friends."

4322,"Soothing and great for casual style players.
Perfect introduction to FPS genre"
4323,"I'm very, very sorry, but for someone like me who has known him for a LONG time ... too long .. and was waiting for him, monitoring their (really very slow is an understatement) progress on development, cannot review it positively. I don't know exactly what the cause is, but the game turns out to be abandoned. the final chapter cost about 3 years of waiting, then what, just a pinch of joke, some small updates, no radical changes from the first versions, just some jellyfish, two dolphins (with which you cannot interact in any way) and an immense infinite ocean of nothing. no seabed to explore, no caves, no mysteries, secrets or easter eggs. the game, however valid technically, fascinating as a concept, but why not, sometimes even fun (even if tedious, not a moment goes by when you don't eat or drink, you can't literally enjoy a moment of peace with that immortal shark that gnaws the raft and the hunger of an elephant under thc, you could eat the whole ocean, useless) completely lacks depth, details, setting ... the islands are all completely the same, just 5-6 concepts repeated with the same spawn of objects and backdrops ... once you explore some of them it's just an endless loop, and often history takes you to places you've already visited recently. there is never, I say never a surprise, something colossal, everything is damn flat and full of barely useful crafting objects. cute how much you can '' embellish '' the raft, but beyond taking an incredible amount of materials, it does not bring any real benefit. the characters are glassy, ​​their eyes look at nothing, there is no interaction with any object, they never speak, it is as if they were ghosts. a cooperative game based on non-cooperating. no interaction, no boost to being friendly. not to mention the discomfort that is created if you fall off the raft and go adrift, first restart the world. the islands are blunt potatoes created in the editor in 5 seconds if not less, anyone would be able to do a more decent job even as a neophyte and without a budget. the NPCs, of animals and birds are tough and without the slightest intelligence, they have an out-of-the-ordinary aggression, they want to kill you at any cost, anywhere, crossing every wall and mountain, without the slightest logic. the worst scene is that of the stranded ship ... the ship conceptually makes no sense ... it has long, empty corridors with nothing. without rooms, without rooms, as if those who lived on them, between guests and workers, walked 200 meters in a corridor without windows or doors that makes a senseless zigzag just to give space to the rooms with the quests. everything has the sole purpose of, either slow you down to make you complete the quest slowly, or get lost with the same purpose. exploring does not reward, you think there could be something, no there isn't. the only glimmer of interest was the box above the ship's roof, which ... without a mate you can't reach. nice for those who are alone. the city, passing hours jump right and left to find pieces of plastic even on the roofs. there is plastic everywhere. in the middle of the game you will find yourself throwing the plastic out of the bow, you will have so much of it that you will have to dispose of it. the objects ... break in 2 minutes counted flat. 5 hours of farming for a spear, 2 minutes to break it. it breaks with every action, even hitting some cotton will break it. not to mention the rats and robots that spawn endlessly as soon as you turn the camera. I mean, I'll be honest I could go on for hours ...

perhaps a concept is not clear to you. they've sold thousands of copies, we're talking millions of dollars, and the game isn't worth that much. I'm sorry, but for me it's a big No."
4324,good relaxing game
4325,YEAH THIS IS A FUN GAME
4326,Very fun
4327,"Enjoyed this game for the 40 hours the full story playthrough took me. I played coop with a friend. Did not experience a single bug during the entire playthrough, so ignore the poor reviews saying the game is buggy.

Gameplay is fun all around, from building your raft, to discovering new items, to exploring new islands and story locations.

The one thing I wish was improved upon is when you initially build the radio setup to navigate to the story islands. There is little direction given (which is great for the rest of the game) and we ended up sailing around aimlessly for way longer than was necessary until we eventually gave in and googled how to operate the radio. We didn't even realize you could press 'T' to open the notebook and find the frequency we needed to enter to locate the first story location.

Overall a 9.5/10 game. Well worth the money. We stopped playing after completing the story as we didn't find it very fun or necessary to continue upgrading out raft afterwards. Will wait for additional story chapters to be released, if they ever come."

4363,IF YOU ON RAFT YOU IS RAFT AND IF YOU IS RAFT RAFT IS LIFE AND LIFE HARD
4364,I got it when it first came out and it was boring as hell I have no idea how it is now
4365,Fun as hell survival game with multiplayer (unlike other survival types). Definately worth the $$. Highly recomended for those who like build/research/survival games.

4380,"This game is ridiculously difficult to play alone, but is still peaceful and worthwhile overall. Alone, the story is slow to develop because it's difficult to manage everything as it gets more difficult but is intruiging and seemingly well written. A game I come back to often"

4389,this game fucking sucks and don't like it
4390,"im sorry i got this game. there is no clues given. you have to figure out everything . you better play on peaceful or you will get pissed. even on easy its very hard.  the biggest thing is cant funken get your raft to go where you fucken want it to go. there has to be a way. how about fucken telling us so we dont waste fucken hours. it shouldnt be this fucken hard
"
4391,"Really cool!
I'd recommend you get it with a friend or two. 
Once you dive into the lore, you'll be hooked.. I've played a solid 10 hours in the past 3 days with a friend trying to beat the game."
4392,fUN
4393,super fun and addictive
4394,"The survival mechanics in this game are fantastic, simple design and great execution - 10/10. I had a blast floating around the world, fishing for scrap, building my raft, and developing new technology. I could have played this game for 100+ hours if it had kept on that trajectory. Unfortunately, the game really falls off for me when it starts to deviate from its core survival game play. Most of the story missions seem to focus more on exploration, combat, and platforming, all of which are serviceable, but not great. The story missions also become progressively longer, around the 5th or 6th mission they were taking me over an hour to complete, and that was with skipping most of the optional bits. I eventually got bored and quit, as my time on the raft began to become eclipsed by my time in the somewhat boring story missions. 

Even without finishing the game I still had a load of fun. The first 40 hours of survival game play were incredibly fun and addictive. Definitely deserves a positive review.
"
4395,best to play with friends but also fun as a solo game!

4398,"Let's be honest: You came here because of Markiplier.

Sorry but I have to tell you this game is really, really bad. Controls are clunky an imprecise, player agency is stripped away at every opportunity, and the world does everything in its power to push you AWAY from valuable items and points of interest. Its not even that the game is a rewarding challenge to overcome like a Souls game, its merely obtuse for obtuseness' sake. Case in point, you literally have to eat and drink more in an in-game day than you do in real life. Most of your time will be spent scrambling to maintain your bars so that you don't die and lose half of your painstakingly earned stuff, and the game is actively programmed to deny you the resources you need to build the things you need in the moment.

Raft hates you. Go play Minecraft."

4410,nice
4411,nice game
4412,"the shark ate my homework
"
4413,"Not recommended.  It pretends to be open world, but it's not really.  The shark is always there and just follows u the entire time. Even if you kill it another takes its place, very unrealistic. It attacks your raft periodically, your spears keep breaking etc... u try to get metal by diving or fall in the water at any time and old mate is there to attack you.  This shark has nothing better to do than follow and harassing you the entire time. Even sharks get bored sometimes!! not unlike myself after playing this game for an hour or two.

In addition, there is a stream of debris that you have to follow, which takes you through the game. If you deviate from this you can't really progress, robbing the game of its sense of open world.  Also the game follows the raft not you, meaning if you hope on an island and your raft floats away - you have to restart as you can't build another as the game is tied to that one raft.  The game forces you down a path, whether you want to go there or not.  Not realistic, not open world, just crap."
4414,"oga booga raft have my brain in a choke hold 
i've had the game for 3 days and played almost 24 hours like hhhhhhhhh it'a so good"

4416,"Too stressful and way too hard to stay alive or even get a grip of anything on ""normal"" difficulty.
There is no tutorial and dying to hunger / thirst while figuring out I need a spear not an axe to stop the shark from biting the raft apart is not particularly fun.
Refund time."
4417,fun.

Wanted to hang out with my best buddys and have a good time floting around.
Got a stressfull pile of garbage that dosnt explain shit to beginners and killes you in like 10 min.

4420,Amazing
4421,swwimmmmmmm with woood
4422,good survival game sharks a neckbeard but that was intended obviously
4423,If you're into fast paced survival games then this is your pick! Decent story line as well in this game. The meat of the game comes from your construction and customization of your raft with thousands of configurations and colors from which to choose!
4424,Great Game
4425,The game play is great
4426,"Astounding game, an example of a good value for money.

The game starts weird, however, gets interesting soon enough.

There are a few minor things to improve, for example, the fact that the shark keeps spawning 3 minutes after killing him.

The only major improvement which is required is that some of the missions and puzzles are over complicated, to the point that the help of guides is necessary. if you do make missions complicated, you have to keep in mind that ingame guidance is a necessity.

Overall, beautiful enjoyable game, it was quite fun, especially with a friend.

8.5/10"
4427,I would recommend easy difficulty if you're playing alone because it's difficult to keep up with everything on your own. Otherwise this game is super fun! I'm just getting into the story portion and I'm really enjoying it. Much more fun with friends but still great if you're on your own. :)
4428,yes
4429,"Well designed, lots of content, hugely immersive! I'm so glad this game exists in the world! My wife and I play it together often - she enjoys the gathering and system management aspects, I enjoy the raft design and building."

4451,"If you're looking for a review on this game you've come to the wrong place, but if you're looking for an outstanding pie recipe you've come to the right place.

Ingredients:

1. 6 tablespoons unsalted butter
2. 1/2 cup white sugar
3. 1/2 cup brown sugar
4. 1/4 cup water
5. 1/4 teaspoon cinnamon
6. 1 pinch salt
7. 5 apples - peeled, cored and sliced
8. 1 pastry for double-crust pie

Directions:

1. Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C).
2. Combine butter, white sugar, brown sugar, water, cinnamon, and salt in a saucepan over medium heat. Bring to a boil, remove from heat and set aside.
3. Roll out half the pastry to fit a 9-inch pie plate. Place bottom crust in pie plate; pour in apple slices.
4. Roll out top crust into a 10-inch circle. Cut into 8 (1-inch) wide strips with a sharp paring knife or pastry wheel. Weave the pastry strips, one at a time, into a lattice pattern. Fold the ends of the lattice strips under the edge of the bottom crust and crimp to seal.
5. Pour butter-sugar mixture over top of pie, coating the lattice, and allowing any remaining sauce to drizzle through the crust.
6. Bake in the preheated oven for 15 minutes. Reduce heat to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C), and bake until the crust is golden brown, the caramel on the top crust is set, and the apple filling is bubbling, 35 to 40 more minutes. Allow to cool completely before slicing."

4460,"I am a 45 yo father, probably one of the oldest people playing this game. I am a single farther to my Son, who is 14 now. My son got this game for Christmas in 2021 from his uncle, so we installed it on his computer and he started playing. By the end of the week he had 24 hours on this game. This was horrible for me, as it was already hard for me to find ways to spend time with my son, as he is always out with his friends or just watching YouTube. So I decided to make a Steam account and get this game to see if I could maybe play alongside him. I loaded into the game, picked my character and started playing but I was stuck on what you where supposed to do. I asked my Son for help and he hosted a game for me to join. I loved it as it was the best time I had spent with my Son since my wife had died. This game has ever since brought me and my son closer again and now we actually spend time together outside the house together as well. This game reminded me that there's fun to be had in everything, and it has brought both me and my Son many happy memories."

The game is great and a lot of hours of play. I love the game and cant wait until they release a DLC or a sequel.
GIVE ME MOOOORE!!!

The game is relaxing with elements of the annoyance of getting eaten by shark and depending on your creativity/difficulty you loose stuff. Love the building part and the story. Only shame is that a lot of the cool stuff isnt given until the end of the game"

4484,Awesome Price for this experience. A lot of fun with friends and even alone its not boring.
4485,great game and I enjoy playing it with my friends
4486,"cool gam
!"
4487,"Pretty immersive survival game. Building and expanding your raft is a wonderful experience all on its own. Discovering the puzzles at each coordinate location and how to solve them was a pretty cool feature and made for some head scratcher moments. If you want the most out of the game, don't look up any videos on it. You wont be disappointed."
4488,"***ISLAND NAMES SPOILER AT THE END***

Hopefully this gets seen by the right people who had negative opinions on this game.

Browsing the negative reviews the main things that came up: 
Losing your stuff when you die
Thirst and Hunger drain too fast
The shark is annoying
The enemies are too hard
Too grindy

All these things are solved if you just play on EASY. Thirst and hunger are more manageable, you keep your inventory, and the shark and enemies don't deal as much damage, in turn making it much faster and easier to collect materials.

 It would seem the devs suffered from retro difficulty syndrome (Yes I made that up) and incorrectly labelled the difficulties. Easy is Normal, Normal is challenging, and Hard is just unplayable.

One important thing to do is collect enough metal and scrap so you can completely fortify your raft and the shark can no longer destroy it. Trying to do this without any knowledge of the game on Normal can be overwhelming.

Before writing off the game, try it on EASY. That been said, this is easily one of my favourite games I've ever played. Every time there was a new story update I started fresh from the beginning just so I could experience everything again, and I'll 
be coming back to play it again in the future, even if there are no more major updates.

The only thing I truly disliked about the game was the parkour area right near the end. I hope this part can get a rework.
And finally for fun, story islands ranked from best to not so good:

Vasagatan
Caravan Island
Tangaroa
Varuna Point
Utopia
Temperance
Radio Tower - I like the layout but it's extremely short
Balboa - This island is just confusing"
4489,"very epic

4490,Is that a yacht?

4492,It's just good :)
4493,GOODGOOD
4494,"Surprisingly fun.  I'd recommend you start playing it without looking up anything about the story because the genuine surprise made playing more fun.  Haven't finished yet, keep getting l distracted customizing the raft.  Scratches that organization itch kind of like fallout."
4495,built a raft
4496,I love this game so much that everytime i play this game i really love this game everytime i play this game.
4497,This has been/is a very addictive and fun survival game to play with your friends. The story is great (after 1.0 update) and the building / suvival part is very nice as well.
4498,9/10
4499,i love the game so much
4500,"SO FAR I'VE BEEN ENJOYING THE GAME ENTIRELY. ONLY THING THAT GRINDS MY GEARS IS THE WIND BLOWING ME AWAY FROM MY OBJECT IN THE STORY ""PEOPLE"" THE 2ND OBJECTIVE OF THE STORY. BEEN PADDLING FOR AN HOUR AND STOPPED FOR 20 MINUTES AND GOT EVEN FARTHER THEN WHAT I GAINED :C"

4516,It is a very good game for solo and multiplayer (multiplayer is very balanced). Definitely worth the pay and gave me a lot a time of fun.
4517,Raft.
4518,I want a refund
4519,I love this game 10/10
4520,It's very fun!!!
4521,"when i first got the game, i didn't really enjoy, but when i came back to the game and i realised there was things to do and a story line, i was hooked, i like to take things slow and take my time and the game allows you to do that, if you are a wanting to complete the objectives it can be done quicker. would recommend this game! 
9 out of 10"
4522,"Great game to play with friends, and have a chill time together."
4523,raft good
4524,pollute the ocean
4525,"I am giving a positive review because I did, obviously, get a lot of enjoyable playtime out of Raft, despite its flaws. It just feels like it could have been a better solo experience than it ended up being.

The entire time that I was playing the game solo, I was left thinking ""I'd rather be playing Subnautica again"". I'm sure it's a lot more fun as a multiplayer game, because it sure feels like it's balanced for multiplayer. (Maybe it's even a little unfair to expect it to be fun as a solo game?) The difficulty is not particularly compelling - higher difficulty just makes the numbers bigger- and killing enemies is extremely unrewarding because of the rapid respawn times. Killing a Screecher, for instance, is practically worthless, since you won't have time to explore more than half of a big island before it magically reappears. It becomes a game about avoiding annoyances rather than a fight to survive. 

I did like the island exploration and the raft construction. The game is also very pretty, even when put at low enough settings to run on my 8 year old computer. I will probably look into mods to make this more enjoyable solo."
4526,"This game hurts my head I hate it 

good game good game buy it for only $19.99 but be warned you will prolly grind for 10 hours straight"
4527,yes
4528,"love this game, a great co-op game! They added a lot, wish they would've made titanium a little easier to access as well as more necessary for progression. They added a lot of great small details which made the game more alive. Would recommend if you love survival games."
4529,Water... Only water.
4530, ui9o
4531,Good game
4532,"Oop I'm addicted. I love this game! I have 3 on going games right now with various friends. I love survival games like this. I'd say this game is pretty high reward for the effort you put in. I am terrified of water but have slowly started to be less afraid of at least the shallows, beyond that.... eh lol. If you enjoy survival games and building up your base, this is the game for you. I would definitely suggest it. 🦈Watch out for Bruce."
4533,fun with friends honestly
4534,bruce can go die
4535,
4536,super fun even though there is a anoying shark
4537,"This is a very fun and exciting game, one I'd definitely recommend to anyone who enjoys a fun survival game with an interesting story. Well worth the $20."
4538,made me hate all living creature
4539,"A perfect balance of a survival game with great fighting, exploring, resource gathering, and especially puzzles. Great game"
4540,Here's a funny prank to pull on your friend! Step 1: Set your gamemode so that you have to be saved by another player in order to respawn. Step 2: Enable PvP. Step 3: Kill your friend. Step 4: Leave them. Leave them to die and don't look back. Step 5: Find a new friend because you no longer have one.
4541,Love the game. I've been having a lot of fun with my spouse playing it. It's a not-stressful fun building and survival game. I'm both happy and sad that they released the final chapter.  I want more.
4542,Fun
4543,super fun but play with a friend
4544,great game
4545,epic
4546,You can pick up lots of plastic out of the ocean just like real life!
4547,"Fun survival game for CO-OP. 
Worth the price. 
Bruce gets annoying though."
4548,so much fun
4549,JHBBHGHBN
4550,"I would without question buy this game again, solid multiplayer game.  

We played it as a family, younger kiddos mostly stayed on the boat, painted and played around with the farming/cooking aspects.  Older kiddo joined in for the story line.  We were confused on how to access the story line for the first days of playing and had to look it up, after that it was smooth sailing (ba dum tss). Parts of the story were amazing, others fell short (which is to be expected).  I was annoyed at the ""parkour"" element in the final chapter, kiddo had no issue.  I found the element out of place compared to the rest of the game.  As it prevents you from progressing to the final boss, I would feel robbed if I was playing alone.  Final boss itself was also a bit of a let down.   Aside from those few things, I enjoyed the game and recommend it."
4551, i haven't beat the game but it is still fun to play if your looking for a game kind of like minecraft this is the game you have to get stuff from the ocean.
4552,you're on a raft
4553,me kill shark funi hahahaha
4554,It's fun.  Relaxing

4559,Ona Raft
4560,"Annoying bugs, when trying to play coop anyway, can't harvest fruit without an axe, can't use my pick/throwing hook to get stones above water, can't tell if i'm about to drink sea water or fresh water. Only played a few hours, but felt linear in crafting and development, and then to top it all off, our raft was consumed by the island geometry, and you can't even make a new one!"
4561,good game would recomend
4562,I LIKE TO POOP WHILE PLAYING THE GAME
4563,damn 20 bucks
4564,muy monito con amigos
4565,Fun game to play with friends
4566,A great time just be patient and the story is a lot of fun
4567,"Why do I like this game?
Its repetitive, very grindy and a lot of the times uninteresting but at the same time incredibly satisfying and beatiful"
4568,i shot a shark and it died dream come true
4569,i like men
4570,"I have tried, time and time again to get into this game - and it falls flat for me every time.

4572,good
4573,uhhh
4574,"Amazing game :). Fun exploration, epic building, decent combat :)"
4575,gud
4576,"Raft is the golden tier of crafting games. Well, maybe second place compared to minecraft. Definitely more fun with friends, but doable by yourself as well. You'll find yourself immersed for hours on end crafting and rafting and stabbing various sharks."
4577,"boat, nice, epic"
4578,Very entertaining and great to play with friends or loved ones
4579,fun and even funner with friends
4580,because its a great game
4581,This is a great survival game to chill with. All of the items and things you can build have an amazing aesthetic that fits the world. They all feel oddly comfortable. Their new story addition add unique places to explore on the open sea. Doesn't feel like a loosing battle if you play by yourself. I guess you might want to skip it if you have a phobia of open waters.
4582,I liked the mix of survival and exploration. It does not hold your hand with a tutorial so you do have to figure out how to do certain things or where to find ingredients you need but it isn't difficult to find out at all. The story islands are neat and provide cool puzzles to solve. I also like how you can build your raft however you want! Make it super tall or very wide and then paint it all the colors of the rainbow.  I'd have to say I don't like how arrows get caught in the air near objects. You can't shoot through the gap under a desk for example or it gets caught 6 inches next to a lamppost. Not game breaking but frustrating to have to learn the invisible extra dimensions on objects if you want to use the bow.
4583,"I really enjoy the loose story line in this game! It allows me to just relax and play but also gives me something to work towards if I want too. I love the building/crafting aspects of the game too, it allows for a lot of creativity!
"
4584,Because it givr me cast away vibes.

4617,addicive.
4618,love to drift around the sea with my friend.

I wish the game was longer.
I really hope the devs will release a DLC soon."

4626,really nice
4627,Absolutely adore this game! It's so much fun to play with friends <3
4628,A great co-op with a weird story.. Playing together makes this work  i would not play this alone as it would become quite boring very fast. Probably 20-25h full lenght. 4/5
4629,bad pirate game :thumbs_up:
4630,It's fun to watch my girlfriend beat up the shark.
4631,yup
4632,"I love this game for its chill atmosphere and simplistic gameplay. Recommend playing with a friend(s).

The good things about the game is crafting is fairly easy to do and is beginner friendly to new gamers. It’s easy to pick up what you can collect and what tools you need to survive. They have simple organized categories to find what you can craft and how many resources you need. The progress you make can be slow but ultimately the end result is very rewarding. You feel a sense of accomplishment and learn to appreciate progress.

The bad parts of the game are some things you do need to look up online to find where you can collect certain ore. Also some resources are very scarce which makes it annoying to make certain upgrades to equipment which can slow down progress tremendously. I would highly recommend also playing this game with friends, it’s nice that it’s chill but friends help make the experience go by faster while also being more enjoyable."
4633,cool  game. i had a shark named broooce and then i killed him and woar his decapitated head. also good game
4634,"Steam should really add more options other than recommend or not to their review system, cause for me this game is somewhere juuust above the middle ground. Gameplay is interesting and pretty original, if gimmicky. Playing it with your friends is fun. Progression is kind of scuffed, but alright in general. It is, however, the first game that made my laptop overheat so much that it shut down due to throttling, which is incredibly mind boggling and kind of ruined the experience for me. Overall, play with friends to make your own fun, otherwise probably pass on this one."
4635,Bruce is one naughty shark
4636,good game but my screen kept on bordering the sides

4655,w game
4656,"You can scroll past this as just another review but this is just my feelings on the game I used to play as a child, anyway here it goes : I always liked this game when I was younger but as i've gotten older and have piles ontop of piles of responsibilities I haven't had time for games but this is genuinely one of the best games out there even with its simplistic style and some of the music brought tears to my eyes and made me realise that even now that I'm older and may think certain games are cringe the memories I had made with this and how happy it used to make me will always stay with me."
4657,Its good
4658,"Raft is a moderately easy survival game and it's great for younger gamers who can't handle the spookiness other survival games have. It has a very cheerful atmosphere and the customization really puts the icing on the cake! You really need to gather as many resources as you can while floating across the never-ending ocean. Running out of wood might force you to meet your demise if you don't stock up or use it wisely.
I recommend this game to anyone who enjoys a casual survival with their buddies. The story has developed immensely since initial release and the story is still continuing!
I look forward to seeing what the developers will add in the future.
Beware of sharks, and stay afloat!"
4659,i am a professional shark hunter. I have accumulated 18 shark heads
4660,Wanna get lost in the ocean with a fucking great white constantly on your ass? Then this is the game for you!  Lots of fun with friends.
4661,really fun
4662,Fun and engaging.

4668,great game
4669,good game
4670,ok
4671,its ah gooooood
4672,"When starting out, Raft can seem like a simple ""go from island to island, gather resources, craft, build, wash rinse and repeat"" game.  To my surprise, there is actually much more to it.  The story, while not amazing, is certainly interesting enough to keep me wanting to get to the next area and unlock more pieces of the puzzle.  I really enjoyed the music and overall atmosphere in this game.  It was also fun exploring the new islands and places you come across.  Upon completing the story, there is still more exploring that can be done!"
4673,Really fun game!  Had a great time playing with my son.  We really enjoyed the puzzles.  Wish the story line was a bit longer.
4674,Just enough content to justify $20 for just the story. Keep going back for the achievements and relaxing vibes
4675,W
4676,"I solo played this game for about 160 hours, and it was fun. Until I tried to invite a friend to play with me...
Co-op never worked. I played with a friend who was the host, the game either crashes/kicks me out, or I cannot throw out my hook / the hook flops onto the ground. I tried to host the game, the same thing happened to my friend. Multiplayer tag should be removed."
4677,"The core mechanics of the base game are good, but as the game progresses, it goes into more of a story mode, and ends up with poorly designed boss fights and buggy mechanics. Super frustrating, as I like to complete games, but I finally gave up on this one. It turned into a slog."

4705,You can throw your friends into the ocean and drive off before they can get back onboard 10/10 would commit blood sacrifice again.
4706,"Raft has become, with alarming speed, one of my favourite chill-out games.  The days of Early Access finally departed and in to the vaunted heights of being a thoroughly completed game, it has continued to deliver in a most serene manner - eye-catching, simplistic, rewarding and brutally addictive.

Starting with little more than a hook and a 2x2 raft, the adventure goes on between procedurally generated islands, both large and small, to the few scripted locations which harbour their own perils and puzzles.  Scouring each island for resources, dragging flotsam aboard in order to expand your craft (see what I did there?), research the materials you find to uncover more elaborate devices and installations to make cooking, water filtration, navigation and defence easier and less time consuming, can be quite fun - with each new development using up more and more space on what can be a confined space for the most part of the early game.

And while you have the options of a Creative Mode, Peaceful, Easy and so on (the hardest difficult certainly lives up to its promise!) I must confess to having restarted the game for the hundreth time on Easy for that relaxing experience.  And while, yes, it may be Easy, you must still manage your hunger and thirst, fend off the sharks from tearing your raft to shreds beneath your feet, explore islands with critters both hostile and agricultural and venture cautiously below the waves in order to retrieve resources that cannot be found above water.

Redbeet and Axolot have really produced a solid title with this and having seen those early renditions of the game when the shark could swim through the island to chew of a section of boat with alarming alacrity, to the over-abundance of certain resources and scantness of others, what we have now is a fantastic balance of all of the above, carefully augmented with a simple, yet still somehow compelling story and a crafting system that can be arduous and yet quite relaxing at the same time.

Suffice to say, this is going to be one of those games that will be remaining installed for the foreseable future.

10 out of 10 - I will certainly be recycling more hours in to this..."
4707,It's a really fun game! I highly recommend it to all my friends!
4708,S'GOOOOOOD
4709,.
4710,"If you haven't got to the secret cow island, you're a noob."
4711,It is great
4712,PL
4713,"A fun game for a group of friends to chill and explore. Explore many islands, expand your raft, tame creatures and fight the hostile environment!

The game is very well done, although it could be even better - a longer, more developed storyline, more variety of islands and enemies. Basically, just more of everything. Or maybe, it's just me wanting to play more of this game?"
4714,lol
4715,"the game is amazing, it's a really nice story and it grown on me so much, I really enjoyed every minute in this game."
4716,Fun with friends and they can jump in at anytime.
4717,great game 100% would play agian

shark is also op nerf pls"
4721,"Highly addictive survival game
"
4722,"Played the game back when there was only 2 chapters and enjoyed it, came back to it once they had finished all the chapters. playing with a friend is a MUST he was my lil hoe and i was the captain. he ran around doing all the little tasks such as collecting, crafting, smelting, cooking. but don't worry i had my own jobs as well, i put some lights up around the ship, sailed us to the next gorgeous location and built a giant ladder. I never found out if there was a build height but boi can you see that ladder for miles. in all seriousness the story was a great mystery with a slight creepy feel to it at times but nothing scary. if you own even 1 friend i would 100% recommend you both to play this masterpiece."

"
4724,"its fun
"
4725,yes
4726,nice
4727,Issa Good
4728,no sex but its fun
4729,idk its fun
4730,yes
4731,I have three things to say. 1 I like the concept and game play is pretty smooth. 2  The game is not difficult to learn and play. While it has advanced recipes they don't make it overly difficult to progress and learn. That makes the actual playing of the game the focus. This creates a fun way pull the player into the adventure/story.   3 Creative mode will allow you to see and play with everything the game will eventually offer as you progress the Story. My Only complaint... When in Creative mode i was very unhappy when i learned creative rafts do not actually move! Such a small minor thing yet it irritated me.... This game is a Lot of fun! Buy it!
4732,Fun and so relaxing to play alone or especially with a group of friends. Also a shark named Bruce will try to eat you constantly! It's like being in Florida on vacation but the oceans rise and your trapped on some floating wood.. the simulator! Only better than that.
4733,"Why the water so polluted?

9/10"
4734,Very gud game. Played for about an hour then my friends got off. I was very sad. I went to bed. It was 3 am. Good game.
4735,"Amazing game, innovation is fun and challenging. The game is so much deeper than i ever expected"
4736,"I saw Limmy playing this on Twitch and had to try it!  It starts out as a survival builder game and as you explore the story begins to reveal itself - there's a lot of inventory management, but there's so much to explore and discover, and a lot of different aspects to the game that it never gets boring, and everything you build has a purpose - highly recommend this title - best game I've played in ages!!"
4737,this game is really fun!  It is even funner when you play it with friends and me and my friend have played it together so much! You should buy this game for sure!
4738,Got the game because I thought it would be kinda fun with friends. I normally play shooters and my friends do to. So I was expecting for us to play like 5 hours. TURNS OUT ME AND A HOMIE BECAME ROLE PLAYING GODS. BUILT A WHOLE RAFT WITH DECORATIONS. FILLED TWO BOXES OF PLASTIC (cuz team seas). AND VIBED TO THE ABSOLUTE SICK BEATS THAT THE RADIO PUTS ON (no seriously get a radio and place that down). So yeah... the games good.
4739,good game
4740,"the shark tried to tickle me
 highly recommend"
4741,its so fun i love it so much its a exploration game to survive from a shark and expand your raft
4742,"phenomenal game, almost perfect in every aspect....however, people named nick seem to not like or understand the game"
4743,"Raft is an... interesting game to say the least, it does something interesting that a lot of these other open world survival crafting games really don't do, and that is, having a constant moving base. A concept that seems interesting and enjoyable at first, until you start to notice the cracks in the execution that spread to other parts of the game, but first let's discuss the raft issue.

You start with a small raft, a base if you will, and if you lose sight of it, you pretty much are screwed and have to start the game over. You can't build a new ""raft"" even if you have all the parts you would theoretically need. You can expand your raft, but need to be a build new one? Nope that's not possible.

That's the first issue I have with this game, if your raft gets lost or destroyed, that's it, game over.

So play carefully, you don't just randomly abandon your raft and you make sure to keep sight of it and also either fight the shark(s) off from destroying it and make repairs as they are needed. 

Not so bad right? Well, take a look bottom left corner of your screen, hold on a minute you're starving and thirsty, but you just started the game, what's going on?! This is the second (and arguably the biggest issue) of the game, your character seems to have one of the fastest metabolisms in the world it seems as if you aren't constantly stuffing your face with both food and water, you'll start to feel the effect (and if you let it go down far enough, you'll start to lose health and then eventually ""pass out"").

Now, I can understand the thirst part, you're on the open ocean, and the sun is beating down on your head, and with no shelter really to start off with, it makes sense that you could become dehydrated pretty quickly. (Of course I would assume at night the temperature cooling down would slow your thirst, but it doesn't) But the hunger? It just feels off.

Now according to the Wiki, all modes have a base hunger loss rate of 0.09 seconds, which is then multiplied by a certain amount depending on the difficulty setting. The following list shows the time it takes for a full hunger bar to reach empty based on each difficulty:
- Peaceful/Easy: 30 minutes, 52 seconds
- Normal: 18 minutes, 31 seconds
- Hard 14 minutes, 15 seconds.

This would be fine, if it didn't feel like a grind, because let's face it, you gotta keep acquiring food, whilst also boiling salt water,  fighting off sharks from your raft, exploring the water around islands to find materials to build things to research to be able to make progress.

New players, are going to have a hell of a bad time on normal difficulty, hell even easy is difficult because of this. Oh and don't forget to boil the water before drinking, because if you don't (let's say you misclick because it happens) your thirst is emptied out almost immediately.

Oh and exploration in the water? Yeah good luck doing that outside of peaceful mode, your ass is gonna keep getting eaten by sharks.

But let's say you're an expert, you enjoy the grind, you manage to build a damn good raft, and you make progress in the story. Well good luck with the platforming nonsense they've added to it as well. Platforming with jank-ass physics and controls, I'm sure that'll go well for you.

Don't get me wrong, after adding mods to it, to slow down hunger and thirst, and playing on peaceful mode, I actually enjoyed the game. The problem is, I shouldn't have had to do that, I should've been able to play the game without worrying every 10 seconds whether I was going to die from hunger or thirst.

On paper, the idea for this game is perfect, it's like Subnautica, but on Earth with a raft instead of underwater bases and whatnot, but the execution misses the mark in several places and bring it down to a level of frustration that I simply cannot recommend on it's own.

If you're willing to mod the game, just be warned that the mod loader does some memory hooking/injection that your antivirus might flag as suspicious (I've heard BitDefender broke the ability for Raft to even launch as a result of the mod loader), it doesn't harm your system from what I can tell, but it does use methods that malware has been known to use.

But yeah, to wrap this all up, I cannot recommend this game if you're simply planning on playing it vanilla, now if you play with your friends or with mods, it's a different story (still has issues but not as bad) but by yourself without mods, it's just not fun."
4744,10/10 game fun with others but just as fun solo has to much content and is generally aton of fun

A review from someone with Thalassophobia and Galeophobia.

At first, this game was absolutely terrifying for me. As time went on, I enjoyed the game more and more to the point I was dedicated to finishing the story. I'll never be fully confident around the shark, but this game helped me feel less terrified of ocean based games as a whole. It was a weird form of exposure therapy with a side of fun.

As for the story, I personally enjoyed it. The ending was harshly judged, I was pretty satisfied the entire way through. Would I have liked more to do at the end? Yes, most definitely. But it is in no way a bad story. Resource gathering is fun the entire way through, never a dull moment especially with friends. Alone, it's a game for people with patience that do not feel the need to rush a game. With friends, it's chaotic and filled with laughs.

The graphics are also not something to glance over. The style of the game is pleasant and some of the views can be breathtaking. The sun setting on some of the lore islands look stunning."

4785,its amazing ! Very fun with co-op
4786,"My friend told me to buy it so we can play together, We only played for roughly 5 hours only, this game is a survival game, and after that my friend didn't want to play the game anymore. After a couple of weeks later, he asked me to buy another survival game called Dinkum, yet another survival game, he said it's fun, which is what he told me in the past that raft is a fun game so i should buy it. 10/10 would waste my money to play for another 5 hours just to get abandoned.  L Friend Rip Bozo"
4787,fun game with friends with a good story. the full game release added some interesting new story content but after the story is complete the urge to play more dies without a fun non-story driven gameplay loop.
4788,fun game that dose not get old
4789,"fun time solo, or with the family. great adventure game. only thing is i would love to have the feature to rebuild a raft if you lose your original raft....."
4790,Very good game
4791,good
4792,ligma?
4793,"Pretty fun, enjoyed making boats and doing dumb shit"
4794,"for 20 dollars? this game is fantastic. truly, it is amazing. i thought for sure it was going to just be a sandbox open world survival game where you just farm and build stuff but i was surprised to find out there is an entire story line that is long and difficult to get through which is exactly what i like. plenty of secrets, plenty of various things to do, plenty of freedom, this game hits all the right spots for me personally. it is an open world survival game, but it has a pretty decent story line behind it too and it's very interesting. i'm always looking forward to the next thing i can discover and the next island i can find, the next blueprint for craftables. if this game was overpriced like most games are now (even the trash ones..) then i MIGHT not recommend it but honestly at 20 bucks, it is actually one of the best purchases i've made in a while. 

as far as graphics go, similar to sea of thieves but not exactly, it definitely looks good but sea of thieves has it beat in a solid handful of ways. stability wise, fantastic in every way, not one single issue with anything so far. running everything on max graphics it's sitting at a solid 80-100 fps with no problems at all. plenty of setting adjustments for everything as well. overall, highly recommend."
4795,It is very interesting use resources on the water and obtain minerals and other resources under the water to create technology again and find civilization
4796,so far its a pritty decent game so to get shit but in all 4-5 stars
4797,çok iyi
4798,very fun with friends online!

4812,"Raft fundamentally asks me to operate against my better instincts and for a survival game that drives me mad.   In this game you are the survivor of a ruined world, covered in ocean.   Clinging to a small hunk of wood, you must use your hook to slowly gather supplies and eventually turn your insignificant joke of a piece of plywood into a truly impressive raft replete with water purifiers, crop baskets, and other amenities.   By way of challenge you are perpetually hunted and harassed by a hungry shark who makes it his personal goal to tear your raft apart and generally be an irritant.   

Now my natural reaction to being consigned to the ocean with a hungry shark trying to eat me was to find land.  And find land I did: for there are many islands in this world.   Jumping from my raft and wading into land, I proceeded to roam the island collecting food.   With no thought to my hunk of wood, I happily spent the night on the island.

And yet come morning I noticed something odd - there were no supplies in the ocean.   Where had they gone? Well, a new raft could be built: I had plenty of materials.   Ahh but in Raft, one does not simply BUILD a new raft.  For you see, the original four raft tiles that you start with are the center of the Raft universe.   They dictate all resource spawns and must be built out from in order for you to survive.   Yes, you can build nothing without your original raft tiles.   

Having thus unceremoniously lost my first game, and having had to turn to the internet to discover the unwritten rule of the game, I returned with a new world to start another journey.   The early  game is tedious as you divide time between farming supplies, farming food, and chasing off the shark.    Once you have built some infrastructure and secured your food and water supply however, the game turns into a fairly uninteresting loop of chasing off the shark while farming up more and more resources.   Fairly realistic storm and tide modeling proves to be a frustration but not a true challenge to overcome.   

Raft does have an intriguing diversion in its in-game story, which is told mainly from you finding landmarks and exploring them for notes and records.   While I greatly enjoyed this aspect of the game, I found the tedium of trying to build while constantly being harassed by the shark on the whole to be an unpleasant experience.   

Raft has a lot of charm with some delightfully moody music and an easy visual style.   It's sandbox construction is sure to appeal to many gamers.   For myself however, I found the game annoying to play.   A fantastic upgrade to this game would be a detailed difficulty slider that would allow me to tune the game to my liking, things like reducing the shark's ability to attack without also nerfing the survival elements of the game.   I was hoping Raft would be the game that would allow me to build my island paradise but the truth is with Raft, you'll never be getting off your boat.   You just sail on for eternity with one lone shark forever pursuing you.   

I neither recommend nor not recommend this game.   I am flatly neutral on it.   Thanks Steam for not having that as an option."

4816,you can fish
4817,"Normally, I don’t write reviews, but I feel like this game is one in particular that deserves one.

The best way I can describe this game, is that it’s an unpolished ball of dirt. In that it’s surprising how someone could make something like this, but it needs to be polished, and maybe given a coat of paint.

Gameplay wise, I did enjoy the game for the most part, as the story requires you to figure it out yourself. There are no hints, there are no map markers, no one outright says “go here to do this thing!”. Everything must be figured out on your own. Which is refreshing, but also pretty time consuming most of the time.

For resource management, equipment, and player abilities, this part definitely could’ve gotten some work too. Too many items require too many things. It’s just a relief islands and areas regenerate if you move outside their render distance.
The “sprinting” if you could call it that is way too slow for a game of this size. The sprinting speed should definitely be the standard walking speed for the player. 

Moving onto the enemies, this part definitely could’ve used some work too. The shark is a pain in the ass to deal with, and respawns too frequently. There should atleast be some late-game item that permanently, or semi-permanently, gets rid of it. Like perhaps a rudementary energy shield (suppose it could be incorporated considering everything else in the game).
Screechers, boars, and bears are also a pain, with screechers being the biggest pain out of all of them. No one wants to deal with boulders suddenly dropped on their heads. 

Finally, we move onto multiplayer, and HERE is where the unpolished part really becomes important.
This game should NOT be multiplayer. Minor lag causes fights with enemies like the shark to be nigh impossible due to the near-perfect reaction time you need to fight it. Players also have no way of letting other players know where they are without using chat if they do much as walking 20 feet away, as their nametag and character itself becomes extremely hard to spot. 

In short, it’s a good game that is somewhat fun, but far from polished and somewhat clunky at times. Do not recommend."
4818,"this game is very fun and worth the money, if you like spending money and fun stuff, then I recommend the game to you!"
4819,"  its definetly more fun with your friends, but still very fun overall"
4820,"This review is from a solo perspective: 

This game is a hell of a lot of fun although I do agree with most of the other posters that the timer on the ""THIRST"" and ""HUNGER"" are way too short/fast as you spend almost all your precious time preparing food and water just to sustain yourself, leaving barely anytime to gather resources. This game really needs to allow us more time to explore and get resources instead of wasting our time eating. I know the game is trying to add realism but all survival games get the ""THIRST"" and ""HUNGER"" aspect wrong. We humans do not starve to death or die of thirst every freaking 10 minutes! We can live weeks without food, days without water.

@DEVS, please consider revamping ""THIRST"" and ""HUNGER"" so that your game would be much more enjoyable, thank you. Also the birds are annoying. They follow you all over the island and you can never get away from them. Big pain in the ass! 

Other than that, the game is extremely fun and worth every penny. =)"
4821,hhh
4822,its a solid 8
4823,water
4824,"Fun and rewarding ocean survival with an intriguing story to boot! Definitely recommend to any fan of the genre and if it is on sale there is no question it is worth a play!

HOWEVER... THE COMBAT IS STRAIGHT TRASH TO A DEGREE THAT IT ALMOST FEELS LIKE A INTENTIONAL FUCK YOU! So do be warned going in that it can be an exceptionally frustrating part of the game. If this might put you off perhaps consider a pacifist playthrough so you can enjoy the core aspects of collecting, building and exploring."
4825,great game but would be nice if i could automate more

4850,"its goog, get."
4851,funny llama stupid shark i hate shark i hope the shark chokes on a large piece of plastic and DIES
4852,this is my second copy of the game. played all the way through the story this time and its nothing to write home about. however it is entertaining and its also very relaxing
4853,....were gonna need a bigger boat....
4854,"good game, just finish it about 33 hours with friends..."
4855,The story is good
4856,I LOVE THE FEEL
4857,love it
4858,"Fun game, even better with friends. Plus it has mod support so you can get so things the base game might be missing which is a good up side. Unfortunately after you play through the story for the first the game becomes a lot more boring in single player. This requires you to rather play with friends (which neither of us have) or play with randos which can be rather difficult to say the least."
4859,"Bought this game for my gf and a couple of friends, tons of fun to perish together on a boat. Highly recommend making the essentials before some goof decides they want to use all the wood and plastic by expanding the boat."
4860,Toes
4861,SO good. Easily one of the best survival games I've played.
4862,awesome
4863,gud
4864,if u have no life then this is the game for u. its really fun and can get a bit stressful but all in all its banger and also its very relaxing... kind of 10/10
4865,this game is truly a Masterpiece.10/10
4866,"The game was better in Early Access.
The story islands ruined it for me and my friend."
4867,cool
4868,a very good game
4869,It gets boring really fast but I still recommend it
4870,"I was born next to the ocean and then moved to the middle of Texas where surfing is just something that you do on the internet. This game really scratches that ""I want to be close to the ocean again"" itch and I can't stop playing."
4871,"[h1]Peaceful? Like hell it was![/h1]

It was going so well till the last chapter, and suddenly, it became an action, platform, fighting game with miserable, grey concrete locations, complicated obstacle courses, no joy, and constantly getting bitten, poisoned, bombed, and torn to pieces! And the story was nonsense.  I gave up at the last location.

All in the so-called ""peaceful"" mode which the game assures me means I will have no enemies.

It feels like the game was taken over by someone who wanted to turn it on it's head because they hate all these players who are ""too wimpy to fight!""

So, chapter one and two in peaceful? Really nice.

Chapter three?  [b]A complete disaster for me. Very annoyed.[/b]"
4872,waft
4873,like
4874,One of the more rewarding games that I have played. One thing that I would like added is a speargun and fish to catch and shoot with the speargun. it would make it a lot more fun in my opinion.
4875,beans
4876,Great open world game! Amazing game play for those who are patient. So many animals and creatures and unique features i have never seen! The story and setting makes things even the more better! 10/10 Love it
4877,fun
4878,"this game kinda sucks i only played it because of friends
"
4879,LOVE IT!
4880,This game made me hydrophobic. They really need to fix the swimming mechanics
4881,the game is pretty good and new items are very good along with the new characters
4882,"Compre na promoção com um amigo e perca tempo não em um bom sentido ainda. 

O jogo não é ruim mas também não é o melhor. Ele tem o loop de todo jogo de sobrevivência que se preze mas se você perdeu o save aí desista mesmo ou espere alguns anos até esquecer de como se joga e volte pois é um grind desgraçado que é característico de jogos de sobrevivência, mas eu só queria que fosse menos grind quando se tem quase tudo no último nível de qualidade, durabilidade e/ou automação. Não acho que seja ruim no sentido de ser universalmente uma merda, mas ainda não é um jogo que eu realmente perderia horas como um certo jogo quadrado por aí, só não é o meu gosto específico de jogo. 

Pelo tamanho do jogo é bem feito, mas na grande comparação com o que existe por aí não é o melhor que tem. 

Sei que estou sendo prolixo mas foda-se.

Recomendo pelo co-op e por ser bom o suficiente."
4883,"it's good game but i wish it wouldn't keep popping up with the ""you're offline some features may not work"" message all the time when i'm offline, just when i boot up the game maybe because it happens literally all the time and gets annoying and breaks the game if i'm looking through a chest or something and have to restart, but overall good game"
4884,"This was an amazing game that I have had fun with for hours! You usually start out in survival, by yourself or with friends. If you beat the game in survival or get bored of it, you can explore creative, where you can build houses, conventional rafts, or try decorating. This is my most played game and I would totally recommend it."
4885,Super fun!
4886,"Pretty good game overall, storage stuff is a little wonky trying to get materials to make a storage but being full- though that's fine, with a buddy you manage ;-; Stuff is a little wonky in general, but I say it's worth!"
4887,i havent been playing for long but so far its pretty nice ( though you gotta be careful that your raft does get stuck on a island
4888,great game
4889,gives you a really fun experience where you live on water and find islands to get materials on. It has a good story line and I would say its a fun game over all
4890,tree men on a boat = sus activities
4891,it fum
4892,The game is great story line is great the graphics are great although i have a few problems getting onto the game it is a 5 star game would recommend

4894,"10/10 Bruce bit my booty and clearly thinks I am a snack. Would be shark snack again.


Buy game, be shark snack."
4895,add sex please :)
4896,It's a fun game to play. There is no rush to finish the story line in this game and there are plenty of things to do to keep yourself busy.

4905,Pretty cool game ngl
4906,Still waiting for battle royal mode
4907,cool
4908,its a fun game
4909,"I'll recommend it, but barely. The raft portion of the game is kinda fun. It's interesting floating out in middle of the water and trying to keep yourself and your raft alive. The game starts falling apart though when you have to hit individual areas to progress the storyline. Most of the ""islands"" feel like chores and aren't what I would call fun. You'll spend a lot of your time frustrating walking around all over the place trying to figure out what you are supposed to be doing especially on some of the much larger ""islands"". I made it to the 2nd final chapter but just tired out. It just felt like the game became a chore and I just wanted to be out on the sea again.
I kept thinking I wish I were just playing Subnautica again. Which if you haven't is far superior to this game and highly recommended. But this one... I just sorta recommend. Maybe get it for cheap, like under $10."
4910,Bruce is misunderstood
4911,"very fun, great story line
"
4912,"Gameplay loop is a little to repetitive for me. Hook garbage to add on to your raft , so you can make nets to catch more garbage to add on to your raft , occasionally stop at an island with virtually nothing on it but resources in the water around it to add on to your raft. meh"
4913,Survival can be relaxing... :)

4918,Veri gut
4919,Cool
4920,much fun
4921,"I got absolutely no idea what i'm doing in game, but i think i'm doing it pretty good.

Also, how do you people build a literal palace on the raft? Mine looks so bad even the shark avoids it and be like: ""yo this raft is itself a destruction, im not needed here"""
4922,"very cool, fucking hate the seagulls for eating my potatoes though... those bastards will pay"
4923,Raft Good Monkey Big Brain Now
4924,"I have to admit I disliked the game from the get go. My criticism has three parts:
1. It is poorly designed and coded. Load times are atrocious. The UI is clunky and non-intuitive. Graphics are poor.
2. It is more suited for a casual mobile game than a PC one.
3. I love games where you gather resources and build but here, I just didn't click. I paid 2/3 of what I paid for skyrim for this game and I played this for 3.3 hours (according to Steam) and even that was a chore, more than for enjoyment. I can totally see myself coming back to skyrim in a year. This, not so much."
4925,"Raft is a light-hearted sandbox survival game that is friendly to those who are new to the genre. 
It does offer a set of story missions that you can complete with lore which I found interesting and easy to follow at your own pace. You are given notes to put in a journal containing all the lore including voice lines if you ever want to read them back.

The story missions will however not hold your hand and include many puzzle scenarios that will require a bit of critical thinking. I tried my best to play through the entire story without help but unfortunately towards the last few chapters I became impatient with a few of the puzzles and resorted to googling a guide.

Your first few hours of the game will feel pretty hectic between expanding your raft, fighting off a hungry shark, and maintaining your hunger and thirst (which can be quite the chore). However once you start progressing by unlocking new items much of this will become easier and allow you to focus on enjoying other aspects of the game.

Item crafting is done well with most recipes and blueprints containing likely resources that you would expect.
Also, keep in mind that item durability can make crafting tedious and demanding, so do yourself a favor and set aside extra tools and weapons for when you break one.

Now for what I consider to be the pitfalls of this game. Unfortunately, combat is simple and crude.
You will find yourself with one type of attack and only a few weapon options. There is no block feature and the only way to dodge attacks is by jumping around. There are a decent variety of enemies in the game but you will notice quickly when fighting on land, your strategy will be the same regardless. For me it was either jump around with the bow or run forward, attack with melee weapon, jump backwards, repeat... 

The other big issue I had with the game was even though the progression did feel good and rewarding, there is zero endgame once you complete the last story mission, leaving you to just kind of float. The worst part was you unlock many cool items at the very end that would have been nice to have much earlier and I felt as though the items were completely useless to me at that point. Hopefully, new content in the future will happen and make up for this.

With that being said, if you enjoy collectibles at perfecting your creations then you may still have fun and I will admit just hanging out and chilling on your raft can be soothing. The game's soundtrack was a bit out of place in my opinion so I muted music and created a sea shanty playlist that I listened to through the whole game which made doing ""raft chores"" and chilling much more enjoyable for me.

You will most likely thrive in this game if you are good at setting small goals, resource management, multi-tasking, and a dash of inspiration.

If you are creative, enjoy building, and like nautical themes then I would definitely recommend this game to you. It is in my opinion equally as fun to play solo or with friends.

Thanks for reading!"

4933,"TL; DR: Solid 8/10

First of all, I'm terrified of the ocean and this type of apocalypse is my worst nightmare. 

Second, if you don't like grinding and I do mean GRINDING for resources, I don't think this game will be for you as even with one or two more people, you'll quickly find yourself out of one material or another while building more onto the raft or just stocking up on food then find yourself desperately scrambling to the nearest island hoping you can get a decent amount while hooking what you can along the way. Thankfully there is an item that you can build along your raft to alleviate this grind a little bit. 

That being said, it's a lot of fun. You can tell the developers put a lot of their heart into it, the graphics are good, the bit of  voice acting throughout is good and the story is intriguing thus far(we haven't finished it), even if you're a bit of a scared-y cat when it comes to open water like me, just try it out. 

P.S I hate the shark and I always will. <3

I would definitely recommend you play this with a friend, as i can imagine playing this by yourself can be quite boring.

Leaked through and covered me

I don't know what to do
When she makes me sad
She is everything to me
The unrequited dream
A song that no one sings
The unattainable
She's a myth that I have to believe in
All I need to make it real is one more reason
I don't know what to do
I don't know what to do
When she makes me sad
But I won't let this build up inside of me

5030,.
5031,"Such a fun and in depth game. Premise is simple: you live on a raft, a shark is chasing you, find the islands to complete the story. Other than that, you can do anything you want. My SO and I play this a lot and we have a really good time!"
5032,Get the boys together and enjoy a well crafted game.
5033,good survival fun
5034,"I want to like this game I really do. But the amount of issues that i come across specifically with my hook and the amount of times it failing me leading me to die. I restarted like 10-15 time thinking it was just a learning curve but I already don't want to play anymore :/

16 Playtime Hour Update:
I still have the same initial feelings as before however I wanted to provide an update. The game is good many can vouch for that fact; I love how everything in the game is crafted and done and applaud that hand down. The only glaring issue with the game is the player is required to have so much skill with the hook (even the better hook has the same issues). I just think the game needs more assistance either with throwing or adding a lower quality net for the start of the game. 

So if this game looks interesting to you just know you are in for about 5-10 HOURS of getting use to the MAIN mechanic that determines the early game. Once you get use to it and get past the early game its not so bad (Or Have friends) but for the solo player beware."
5035,the new boss fights added so much to an already enjoyable game. even after finishing the story i found myself still doing upkeep on the raft.
5036,very fun(better with friends)

5041,This is a top 5 all time game for me. Its great solo and great with friends. You're able to sit and chill or grind and expand your raft as much as you want. The added decorations were a great addition that helps add that extra personalized touch. Really enjoyed the story and the ending and sense of accomplishment.

5055,"I've played this game a ton. I've done at least 4-5 playthroughs, one being on hard mode that got stuck while we waited on the final chapter.
I want to say yes, I recommend this game, but frankly, I find it hard to.
Pre-Final Chapter? Certainly. I enjoyed the game a lot for what it gave and what little story there was.
Post-Final Chapter? No.

For a game that got stalled almost 2 years, the lack of content for the last push was noticeable. Ya, it was long, but that's because it was padded out by unnecessary ninja warrior style puzzles. And the sudden intro of bosses just felt jarring and unneeded.

I don't want to give spoilers, but the final location gives you blueprints that are basically useless. There's 0 play value beyond the final island unless you plan to just work on your raft some more, so why in the world would you hand us the Titanium weapons at the literal end of the game + a couple of other blueprints for the raft that might have been useful had this not been the literal LAST island in the game.

I just feel like there should have been at least one more location added, before the final area, that gave you these weapon blueprints so you could actually use them.

On top of all that, the re-write of the overall story of the game felt weird. Having a rather minor NPC mentioned turn into the big baddie is fine, but having all the characters you randomly collect so you can play them just felt disjointed, since the whole point, at least to me, was traveling and chasing the supposed humans. Now we have random humans living on Balboa, Tangaroa, etc.

If it's on sale, buy it. But don't pay full price."

5062,"Genuinely, an enjoyable game to play to say the least. I put a few hours into the game with some friends and we had completed the story and decked out our raft to make it look nice and prim. There is a vast range of customisation options for the raft which I loved and the story was engaging throughout.
The start of a new raft is always difficult with the heavy demand for materials and the impending doom of starving is always present, but it gradually gets easier and more comfortable, an aspect I liked about the progression and your knowledge of the game improving as you play. 
Overall, I quite like the game and would recommend to others if they enjoy this type of game, you just need to commit to the raft in the early stages to reach the gold mine of end game in my personal opinion."
5063,it is very fun but i reccomend playing easy first
5064,"Fantastic open world survival game. On par with subnautica and introduces some fun concepts. I particularly like the freedom you have to build your raft and the story island locations.

I havent tried coop yet but Im sure its a blast,"

5066,good
5067,this game is an AWESOME survival game. So much story line and fun! For the 40 hours i have played this game i have enjoyed every second of it. 10/10 do recommend.
5068,"my raft has floated away, help"
5069,"Highly recommended for anyone who likes open world survival crafting games. Excellent coop game with friends. The new 1.0 release really fleshed out the game, provided a satisfying conclusion, and added new upgrades and features that only improved my experience after having ""beaten"" the beta version of the game several times in the past. 

The music is great. I am very fond of the building mechanics. Exploring and upgrading is rewarding and fun. Bruce is always a jerk but he sort of grows on you. And I really like the graphics/art/color choices even if they're not overly complex or cutting edge. It all works together to make a satisfying gaming experience that me and my friends have enjoyed time and time again."
5070,nice
5071,"Fun Game, some obstacles cannot be overcome due to glitches. SO I built ladders and gangplanks to overcome them."

5083,"Shark bad, kinda annoying as you can't keep him 6 feet under. Murder him frequently for free food"
5084,"Raft kinda caught me by surprise. The longer I played, the more it grew on me. 
The story-line is interesting and I like that you basically do island hopping, so you can find even more stuff to upgrade your raft with. 
Fun that you can also play this with friends, or decide to just build a raft and that's it. 

All 'n all, pretty nice game!"
5085,"How do I set the game up with a controller and play with a controller?
"
5086,"It's worth a playthrough with friends.
Platforming controls are a bit naff and the item durability feels a bit low.
I'm glad i played it with a friend as i feel doing it solo would of been crazy hard.

Either way, get some friends, build a raft and play through the story!"
5087,One of the best survival builder games I have played. The raft experience and the importance of your base (the raft) is crucial and compelling.
5088,"Solid 8/10
Getting materials underwater can get a bit monotonous and time consuming and might wear you out after a while but that;s literally the only complaint I have with this game. It's so much fun!"
5089,Hell yeah. Best ocean game ever
5090,a solid game to just play around in or play with friends.
5091,Extremely fun with friends singleplayer aswell kinda but mostly the type of game that would be played with friends.
5092,"Good game! The only thing I didn't like is that so crafts are a bit waaay to expansive and in order to build an impresive raft you gonna need a loooot of planks and it's quite hard to get them, too much grinding."
5093,Really relaxed game. Starts off really slow though.
5094,"Cons:
- no tutorials/hints
- clunky combat (or maybe I just haven't gotten the hang of it yet?)

these are really my only big complaints so far after about 8 hours played.

Pros:
Beautiful visuals
engaging gameplay
sound design
fun and chaotic with friends
interesting implications of ""story"" without being too much
challenging, but not so challenging that you want to yeet your PC across the room XD

would love to see:
more customizable avatar designs

Got this as a gift but had been planning to buy it for myself eventually.  So far I've really enjoyed this game. I am by no means ""good"" at it yet, but with research and learning from other players I'm getting the hang of it. Definitely recommend!"

‣ 9/10 – F sharks, all my homies hate sharks.
‣ Thoughts: Raft has been a nice surprise in the survival game genre. Not only would I consider this one of the best survival games I have played over the past few years, but also one of the most enjoyable games this year. Yes, it technically released way back in early access, but considering the release of 1.0 this is the full version, and it came out this year. Not only do you have plenty to do on the raft, but there’s also plenty of story focused islands to explore and other little pit stops to constantly make. The gameplay loop here is brilliant and very well designed. You will find yourself constantly juggling resources and microimaging every little thing on the raft you have built. Some parts will become in a way self-sustaining, but you will become the automized robot who will keep the boat alive. I found the core gameplay the best thing here, the combat was hit or miss, but served its purpose even if some parts of it looked unfinished and goofy. The story is hit or miss some might like it some might not, I personally found it bland and boring. If there were only islands to explore with no context, I would have been totally ok with it. The voice acting did little to support the narrative as I found it extremely amateur and, in some ways, racist in how the accents were portraited in the most stereotypical way possible. But besides that, the game looks very good, the raft building is done well, the soundtrack fits perfectly and overall, the game is a blast with a friend. If you are tired of survival games this might be the rejuvenating thing you need in this genre.

5118,Cleared first run through in 27.8 Hours. A lot of fun. I do wish the metal detector was accessible earlier in the game though because some gathering of late game mats is a bit crazy rng to farm up. I would very much recommend to play with others and not solo.

5124,great game lots of interactives
5125,"For the price its ok, not much assets and you just grind over and over the same thing to progress the story and unlock things that give automation. Game is easy and casual even on hard but still fun to finish story. At end game you can just decorate your raft. The worst thing is buying your time by things like drinking juice with glass and eat sup with clay bowl so you need to farm small islands for clay and sand over and over again ;p"
5126,you're not allowed to KILL olaf at the end of the game. I WANTED TO KILL HIM. But other than that the game is ok.
5127,thought I would hate it but I love it.
5128,"is very enjoyable, however can be a bit back and forth when u explore islands but when u are just on the raft it rlly fun"
5129,"I wouldnt say this is a POSITIVE or NEGATIVE review. However, the game (AT FIRST) is pretty fun. The story line is cool and the styling is unique. However this game has no replay value. Yes, they add updates once every YEAR maybe. However by then you need to backtrack all the work you already did and play the same story again yada, yada, yada. Its good, but no replay value"
5130,ass game
5131,Trust.
5132,"I really hate that I feel compelled to write a negative review for this game. Before the introduction of Act 3, this game was sitting in my top 10 favorite games to play.
Chapters 1 & 2:
	The game overall is an amazing survival game that is story driven. While you can mess around and ‘just survive’, the game makes you want to continue the story to be able to collect more crafting recipes and items while also learning about the lore of it all. While the game isn’t hard, it's not easy either (There are game mode settings like Minecraft’s difficulty slider if you would prefer a peaceful or a more challenging experience.). With each area you go to, you have to kind of prepare for each one by gathering resources and taking your time doing so. I felt like I could enjoy each area and everything that it had to offer while being able to experience the new items I could make after I would leave. The overall pacing just felt right…Then chapter 3 hit and threw all that out the window.

Chapter 3/Final Chapter:
I think it was because friends and I had been waiting for a year and a half for this update. Despite how many delays there were, we were hopeful that there would be a lot of content in this new update. While some environmental things were added like random sea animals (That you can't interact with) that would show up around your raft, a lot of act 3 felt like a majorly rushed platformer game. The first part of Act 3 has a cool mini-boss, but that's about all that it has going for it. Unlike Acts 1 & 2, I felt like we breezed through the entire last act without a second thought. There was no prepping needed. The second part of act 3 was just a baron winter wasteland that was empty with reskinned bears as polar bears and a new enemy that was more of an annoyance than a challenge. I think the part that really ticks me off about the entire update was the final part. The massive amount of platforming, the sheer emptiness of the area, and the awful boss fight that had friends and I saying “What the hell is this?”. The biggest insult was the fact that you would get blueprints for new items after beating the game.

If you end up getting the game after reading this, just play until the end of act 2 and call it a day.

5135,"Best played with group of friends.

You can play this as survival challenge (hard difficulty) or even go for designing raft only (creative mode).

The content is focused around the story location, other than that it is about resource management and exploring non-related story island. For now Update 1.0 there's no end-game content other than completing achievement."

5147,"As far as survivor games go, this one is pretty good. The interface is intuitive and easy to use. There's enough obstacles to make the game challenging without being so difficult you can't progress. Plus there's multiple difficulty settings that really accommodate every level of player. The world is super pretty (I went swimming in a coral reef at night surrounded by glowing jellyfish. It was amazing), and the multiplayer works very well. In fact, this is one of my favorite games to play with friends. I like that everything I do feels important, no task is too small, and no one person ends up pulling all the weight. I've even grown fond of the shark, now that he can't rip off pieces of my boat. It's harder than Minecraft, so expect that, but there's also no horror element in it either, so it's safe for a younger audience. Especially if you play on peaceful or creative. Plus it's just nice to have a survivor game that does not include zombies. I mean, why is it always zombies? This game ends up feeling more like practice for when global warming raises the sea level and we're ALL on rafts scavenging for resources. So I guess getting this game can help you prepare for the future. Sharks and all."

5160,"If you're looking for a review on this game you've come to the wrong place, but if you're looking for an outstanding pie recipe you've come to the right place.

Ingredients:

1. 6 tablespoons unsalted butter
2. 1/2 cup white sugar
3. 1/2 cup brown sugar
4. 1/4 cup water
5. 1/4 teaspoon cinnamon
6. 1 pinch salt
7. 5 apples - peeled, cored and sliced
8. 1 pastry for double-crust pie

Directions:

1. Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C).
2. Combine butter, white sugar, brown sugar, water, cinnamon, and salt in a saucepan over medium heat. Bring to a boil, remove from heat and set aside.
3. Roll out half the pastry to fit a 9-inch pie plate. Place bottom crust in pie plate; pour in apple slices.
4. Roll out top crust into a 10-inch circle. Cut into 8 (1-inch) wide strips with a sharp paring knife or pastry wheel. Weave the pastry strips, one at a time, into a lattice pattern. Fold the ends of the lattice strips under the edge of the bottom crust and crimp to seal.
5. Pour butter-sugar mixture over top of pie, coating the lattice, and allowing any remaining sauce to drizzle through the crust.
6. Bake in the preheated oven for 15 minutes. Reduce heat to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C), and bake until the crust is golden brown, the caramel on the top crust is set, and the apple filling is bubbling, 35 to 40 more minutes. Allow to cool completely before slicing."

5186,"It's been years since a game caused me to lose track of time. With Raft I found myself just enjoying a game's mechanics and story, becoming immersed in it. How the story is discovered during play is especially rewarding. Well worth making it an addition to the library! It's good fun as a solo experience, but bring some friends along; it adds a whole new element to the fun."
5187,One of the best co-op experiences available.

My only downside of this game is that it does get a bit repetitive and boring having to farm and grind for certain items but overall I would recommend this game.

5226,"First saw Asmongold streaming this and thought it was worth a purchase to try it out. Glad I did, currently playing this with my friends which is usually difficult due to a very varied amount of skill level in our friend group which makes other popular multiplayer games not an option.

Here we are all able to play and work towards common goals towards advancing the raft or survival. The story is great it takes you to new places regularly and each one allows you to get that bit better tech, exploring the story areas is very satisfactory.

I think I made the right choice in not really googling how to do things as I think that would take away from part of the enjoyment of the game.

Haven't explored solo play much, it might be pretty good solo but I think better in a close nit group."

The wife and myself picked this up to play together and we put 24 hours into the game within first two days of playing.  We got hooked.  Now we have almost 50 hours in and will be finally starting the story after just having fun floating from island to island and making out raft.  If your a fan of the survival / building type games this is definitely one you should check out!"
5231,fun
5232,"I am a 49 yo father, probably one of the oldest people playing this game. I am a single father to my son, who is 14 now. My son got this game for Christmas in 2021 from his uncle, so we installed it on his computer and he started playing. By the end of the week he had 24 hours on this game. This was horrible for me, as it was already hard for me to find ways to spend time with my son, as he is always out with his friends or just watching YouTube. So I decided to get this game to see if I could maybe play alongside him. I loaded into the game, picked my character and started playing but I was stuck on what you where supposed to do. I asked my Son for help and he hosted a game for me to join. I loved it as it was the best time I had spent with my son since my wife had died. This game has ever since brought me and my son closer again and now we actually spend time together outside the house together as well. This game reminded me that there's fun to be had in everything, and it has brought both me and my son many happy memories."

This game is relaxing yet still contain some stakes as death from the environment and enemies is still possible. I would highly recommend this game for any group of friends trying to stay in touch over long distances. The game does an excellent job balancing the adventure, resource management, and story elements, which provides quite the enjoyable variety to the gameplay. I have no major complaints about this game except for one thing....

We found the lack of additional rare fishing loot, such as the Lucky Cat or Scrap Mechanic Duck, deplorable.

My friends and I are all degenerates. We would use Raft to gamble by betting who would fish up the first Candle Bottle, Old Shoe, Lucky Cat or Scrap Mechanic Duck. As a result of this degeneracy, the next time all of us met in person, almost every single meal we had together was to fulfill losses over bets in Raft. We feel that Raft would better support our degeneracy if they added additional fishable rare items. We feel like that would be socially responsible thing to do. Nothing brings friends closer together than gambling online."

5269,bustin with the bois is fun
5270,Yep very good game
5271,a really fun and chill experience. I have a love for casual games and this hits the right spot. Saw this game all the way back in early access back when I still watched youtubers play and it looked like a lot of fun. Good to see it kept it that way. You don't need to search up too much on the wiki. Just a few bugs that I saw all the way back then are here still but are not too distracting. Like you're hand will sometimes bend in a weird way and not let you use the item you have just equipped for a few seconds. Also you have to pick up the scarecrow if you want to paint because walking past it while painting glitches and locks the paintbrush from being able to paint. The combat is a fun challenge and rewarding when you have to craft to kill or capture certain animals.
5272,Raft is a really good game. It is a survival game that keeps you busy and entertained at the same time weather you are with or without friends. There is a good amount of difficulty if you want a harder experience. The only problems i have are a few bugs and the usefulness of some items (ex. flippers and oxygen bottle). But overall a good experience playing.
5273,"I love this game! I've spent many hours drifting about, gathering wood and plastic, and just having a good time. I love discovering treasure, building cool tools, and decorating my raft. 

Bruce scares me everytime though, haha! I'm also pretty nervous of the water, it's a little unnerving for me to be swimming and to look down and see nothing, but that's what made this game fun! 

I also loved the co-op, my husband and I would play for a few hours together most nights. I'd tell him I need metal and seaweed, and he'd go off searching for it for me while I make food and smoothies, and make him new tools. It's so hard to find fun co-op games, and this is one I'd definitely recommend. Each plot island has fun puzzles to figure out, and plenty of treasure! 

We just beat it on Normal mode, and it was a blast! I know that it was just recently fully released and no longer in ""Early Access"", but I'm already looking forward to any potential DLC's or expansions! I want more islands and puzzles! 

Thank you for making such a fun game!"
5274,love getting knocked out by the sniper bird with a rock
5275,its fun
5276,amazing fun completed with friends and have almost all of the achievements
5277,its like crack.
5278,What a wonderful game! Raft brings a refreshing and fun twist to the traditional survival game. The constant danger of the persistent shark perfectly motivates players to quickly and cleverly add to and adapt their raft in order to survive. The food and water meter are very well paced as to keep the player on their toes without burdening the player and taking away from the game. The lore is interesting and exciting to discover. Works great for single play and multiplayer. Highly recommended!
5279,"I player was fun more people is awesome, great game fun and amazing"
5280,I'm not Commander Shepard and I hate that bloody shark!
5281,yummy
5282,one of the best games to play with friends

5284,"Very fun and exciting game. Keeps you on your toes. It's very similar to Minecraft, just more realistic."
5285,"this is a great game for every type of gamer, the survival mode is great, there is story and lore, there is a ton of content, best $20 spent."
5286,honestly its a pretty cool game. There aren't too many problems. In the beginning crafting can be a bit too expensive but thats only in the beginning.
5287,Good shark. Fun chickens.
5288,"Very good chill survival game to play with friends that includes a ton of content.  The story is exceptional with little no bugs or glitched.  Raft is your typical survival game with a ton of elements that make it unique such as the amount of customizations to your raft like paintings, furniture and more.  I personally would recommend it if you enjoy games that heavily depends on exploring."
5289,love the new update :)
5290,bro i have put a lot of time in to this game and it was super fun
5291,"Great artwork, love the customization for a players' raft. Even split between rts and survival."
5292,"You: finally have enough supplies to place engine on your raft
Shark: is for me? 👉👈"
5293,GREAT GAME
5294,i like big black tasticles
5295,Yeah it's pretty good with friends.
5296,"Never thought i would be able to get into this game, as i am not big on survival games! But i have had SO much fun playing this game with friends!"
5297,i did your mom
5298,I love that it fun both alone and in a group! It give enough challenge to keep you on your toes as a single player but still allowing enough room to explore.
5299,hours of fun!
5300,great game. very relaxing.
5301,9/10 A little glitchy from time to time but overall an amazing game.
5302,"YES GOOD
"
5303,"Honestly, I wasn't sure what to expect from this game when I first bought it. One thing that drew me to the game was the name, Raft, and the pictures of you being on a raft. We finally have a survival based game where you're ""home"" is on a raft. It was honestly really fun to play, short game but quite a bit to do if you just want to sit down, kick back, and kinda relax."
5304,nice
5305,"Honestly one of the most interesting and fun games i've played in a while, i've spent the last few days completing the story and i've had the best time doing so. And as I said, it was fun, but of course at some points it gets obtuse, but that kinda adds to the fun of figuring things out.

The exploration in Raft is also honestly top notch, the random islands and such you find are so neat, and the further you go in the story the more accessible/useful things on those islands become especially if you get all the blueprints. The story and locations in raft are definitely chilling yet amazing and in the end everything ties itself up in a nice little bow after you read everything.

Though there is no such thing as a perfect game, the enemy spawning is a bit annoying in some areas... and the AI is a bit weird at some times (cough cough mama bear), other than that the puzzles were a bit confusing at times, and I noticed some concepts that appeared once never appear again, and feel sorta shoved in as far as I can tell.

In conclusion though, Raft is one of the best games i've played in recent, and is worth the 20 bucks you could drop on it, especially with the online multiplayer (havent tried it yet sadly). I personally would give it an 8.5/10!
"
5306,I named the shark Terry i dont care about the lore and stuff its Terry now
5307,the ocean scary
5308,it is such a fun game !! amazing time to spend with my dad
5309,tt
5310,"[h1]PLEASE BE AWARE THAT THIS POST CONTAINS SPOILERS[/h1]

First, a disclaimer: I wish I could give a mixed review. Overall, I would still recommend this game, but not as wholeheartedly 
as I'd like.

I'd heard a lot about Raft, and it had several good reviews. The idea of an open world survival game  that WASN'T filled with zombies (or some other horrid creature) was a wonderful concept.

So after 116 hours in the game, here are my impressions (which may be subject to change):

Gameplay:
The chance for multiplayer gives this a wonderful connection with friends. It's really fun to play with others and especially since it actually affects the gameplay. Single-player is fun in it's own way as well, since it's pretty relaxing for the most part. The controls are a bit clunky, and the combat feels sluggish and difficult. It can be downright punishing at times, and the platforming is... not good. [spoiler] The windmill platforming in Utopia is particularly frustrating. [/spoiler] The puzzles kind of come out of nowhere, and they rely heavily on being able to explore every inch of a story island, which is not always easy or straightforward. [spoiler] Particularly in Balboa, where it's extremely easy to get lost, especially without a map, which you don't even receive until it's practically useless. [/spoiler] However, the collecting part of the gameplay is relaxing for the first little while. It's a typical ""grind to get your materials"" style of game. As you gather more materials, you're able to progress, and it feels good. Until you hit a wall when there's nothing else to do. Which leads me to my next point...

Progression:
Due to the lack of a tutorial of any kind, I had no idea that the first blueprints were necessary. I hadn't realized that in order to get anywhere (story-wise), you'd have to build the antenna and the receiver. The research table was not explained, and so I thought that everything I could craft would already be in my crafting menu. Once I discovered the function of the research table, I realized there was more that could be unlocked, but that also meant that I had no idea how many items or collectables were actually in the game. (And without Google, I still wouldn't know.) Once I got into the story, the islands were really fun and unique to explore, but I questioned why, if some of these places existed, that I would be on this raft in the first place instead of choosing to stay somewhere. Especially with the Final Chapter, it feels anticlimactic [spoiler] to achieve titanium tools and weapons only after they would have been useful. Especially the titanium large storage... [/spoiler] For the same reason, fishing and [spoiler] trading at the trading post [/spoiler] really aren't even that critical until the end-game. Most of the time, anything you can get early in game functions well enough that you'd never really NEED to build improved versions of anything.

Food:
Certain islands hold certain types of food, such as watermelon and pineapple early game, and [spoiler] red berries, juniper, and chili peppers, etc. which you can get at trading posts or large islands. [/spoiler] However, the recipes that you find often use the mid-to-end-game items which are NOT renewable, which doesn't make sense to me. [spoiler] For example, the juniper that can be bought at the trading post and used to make the death-defying hearty stew, should have been made more difficult to obtain, and then made renewable once you got it, rather than being a one-time purchase only.[/spoiler]

Exploration/Story:
Exploring the story islands was a fun and unique challenge. I loved the first and second locations, as they made a lot of sense. It was possible for me to see [spoiler] why those locations would have been abandoned. [/spoiler] However, as the game went on, it made me question why a lot of these places [spoiler] weren't just re-settled by the people who originally inhabited them. [/spoiler] For example, [spoiler] once Olof is defeated in Utopia, why couldn't someone sail to Caravan town, bring along some crops and animals from an island, and live like that? [/spoiler] It was a bit difficult to get immersed once I started seeing full-blown locations such as [spoiler] Tangaroa, the floating city, which easily could have remedied it's rat problem with a few well-equipped rafters and some new crops from different islands. Especially since the strawberries and bananas seemed to be growing just fine? [/spoiler] I also particularly would have liked to see many more places like [spoiler] the underwater city of Varuna Point [/spoiler] because it tells a lot about the state of the world. It would have been cool to get more underwater elements and environments. It also would have made adding in more upgraded aquatic gear more reasonable (which honestly should already be in the game anyway).

Water:
I get it. It's a Raft, the world is water, but also... [spoiler] it seems very problematic to have battery-powered anything in conjunction with salt water. Something tells me it would short-circuit pretty fast. [/spoiler] Having better collision physics with a lot of the items in the game would add to the immersion, such as if you built walls around the bottom of your raft, water should no longer be able to get in/wash over the base of the raft. It's something minor, but it kind of affects the immersion and realism of being able to do some of the things on the raft.

Overall, this game has so much potential, and [b] I really hope that this isn't the end of it's development or story. [/b] 

I would love to see the following come to Raft:

- A way to change game difficulty in your save (for example, deciding to make an easy game into a hard one or vice versa)
- A way to gain back some of the metal lost on reinforced raft parts
- Better water physics/collision physics when it comes to the raft
- Smoother/more refined combat
- Many more unique locations, both above and below the water
- Improved aquatic equipment (oxygen tank, flippers, etc.)
- More variety in the islands (different biomes with different things to explore is always fun)
- Make any plant renewable [spoiler] Ex. juniper, red berries, turmeric, etc. [/spoiler]
- Allow the story to be told through the vast and variable environment, and not necessarily have to tell it through the narrative (people can create their own stories of their own worlds this way)

All in all, my final thoughts on this game are that it is worth the buy, perhaps while it's on sale. I still think it is worth the money that I paid for it, but I can see how someone might get a bit bored after completing the story. Especially if building is not your thing... And even then, creative mode exists for the building part. It's still a fun game, and it's got a lot of places it could go, and I hope it continues to grow and expand and become even better than it currently is."
5311,!!
5312,"Lots of fun in the early game when you're just trying to survive on your raft. I enjoy the story components once you've established your raft. Though I haven't finished the story yet. It seems there are some new glitches in the game, like when you load into a friend's game I can't throw my hook. It just drops to the ground. I have to throw it out of my inventory and re-equip it, then it works. Also, if someone drops items and waves knock them off for the friend, the one who dropped the item's will still be in place for the one who dropped them. Odd glitches that made the game hard to figure out workarounds but I'm still enjoying the game.

I really don't like how the Roc can kill you so easily (I'm playing on Hard mode) or at least how it B-lines to you whenever your near. It makes some islands inaccessible and I haven't figured out how to kill it yet."
5313,Love this game but hate the shark
5314,"Really fun 
"
5315,"Take some getting used to early on, but don't give up. Once you get the mechanics and build tree, it will get much better."
5316,"Created a country with a government, currency, taxes, jobs, and a moderately functional economy. This is no longer Raft, this is the Divided Districts."
5317,bruce is a bicth
5318,gud
5319,it is a good game.
5320,
5321,the game
5322," Very immersive game with great story. Easily worth the 20 dollars I spent on it and I would definitely recommend it, especially if you have friends."
5323,super boring alone but alright with friends
5324,"Addictive fun! When I initially started playing, I thought this game was just about surviving, but once I got the hang of it and found out about the story, it was so addicting trying to sail from place to place and learn about the quirky, cool characters. I would definitely recommend. I've been playing games like Slime Rancher, Stardew Valley, and Minecraft and this gave the same feels but with its own twist. Immensely fun to play and an all-around beautiful, immersive game."

5326,good game

5339,"I love raft! It is a really fun multiplayer game. Although I can't say I ever play alone, so I don't know if solo is harder or not. There's a lot to do and unlock and I really enjoy the creative ability to build any shape raft you want and color everything as cute as you want it to be! Stupid Bruce is annoying, but he can't chew through metal! >:) Even after finishing the entire story line, I still find this game fun to play!"
5340,"This game is incredibly addicting. It has the right mix of survival and creative aspects, without being overwhelming. I've been playing on easy mode because I was looking for a more relaxed experience, and it definitely hit the mark. I've only had the game for 3 days and I've already played for 31 hours!"
5341,"10/10 Would recommend, story was fun. There is still stuff to do after the story but it is 100% worth the money."
5342,10/10 would recommend
5343,this game is an example of why polluting the ocean is a good thing
5344,"Still many bugs, like the raft getting stuck in or even below islands, constant stuggle for water/food leave no room for actually expanding the raft."
5345,the game itself is fun but the story missions are absolutely awful
5346,"good game
sailing is fun
fuck Bruce"
5347,GOOD GAME

"
5359,Good stuff big take too good :)
5360,"I still come back to this game off and on to play with my Girlfriend.  It has it's fun times but it is a colossal waste of potential. It's as if the developers are on a constant vacation.  Not to mention near impossible achievements.  Hook 5000 items, paint 1000 times, DESTROY or remove 100 foundations....Gee what kind of imagination went into those achievements?  I have 99 hours on record and i'm only half way to the 5000 hooked items.  It's clear i'll never get that.  There isn't enough content to keep me hooking items for that long.  Literally no NEED to hook items when you can just build item nets that auto gather everything that passes through them."
5361,"i like it
"
5362,fun
5363,"If i was to rate this from one to ten, I'd give it a yes out of ten."
5364,awesome game love the grind gathering materials doesn't get old because  of the build potentials and customization once you get the smelter game really opens up love it add more please!!!
5365,"It's the perfect combination of crafting, survival, and exploration/adventure.  It's even more fun with a friend!"

5370,Fun co-op exp :)
5371,Very nice survival but the fucking puzzles are dogshit design
5372,great
5373,"Honestly a really fun game, but in my opinion its only really fun when playing with otherss"
5374,Best ocean survival game I have ever Come across
5375,"I love the game play and the adventure. Also you can set it at peaceful, easy, normal, and hard for the more experienced player."
5376,"Great game to play in coop, the early game can be quite hard but it gets easier with time and experience."
5377,good fun times
5378,"this game is the fucking best suivel game ever
"
5379,Ocean
5380,"This game very good i would recomend 5 out of 5 the game has great graphics and shadows its tough at the start but you get it

Good day"
5381,Nice and relaxing. I preferred to play with mods.
5382,take your time playing through the story and at least with 1 friend and the game is great
5383,"Pretty cool online survival, but you definitely need to play with friends, because one gets very bored, it's interesting to build a raft and study all kinds of chips, and the game has nice graphics that will pull any PC"
5384,"The story ending was honestly pretty lacklustre and not really worth the 18 month wait between the last major updates,  the early parts of the story were hinting at some big mysteryor conspiracy as to why the world is flooded, maybe you'll find the person responsible, or find some people who were building the floating cities or something, but it ended up just being a really generic bad guy with no payoff. You also unlock the best equipment after finishing the game, which didn't really make sense since there's less incentive to keep playing after you've finished everything. 

The shark is also more of an annoyance than anything else, it's very easy to kill but still takes time so its a whole load of effort to go and dive under islands for resources. 

The early game is also really difficult if you don't know what to do, you spend a lot of time scavenging the same resources over and over just to be able to progress.

Overall though a really fun game once you get into the swing of things, there's a lot to do and a lot of places to explore, and you've got a lot of customisation options for your raft."
5385,good but lagey but smaller reslosin = les lag
5386,yes

5388,9.5/10
5389,"I picked up Raft during the 2022 Summer Sale.  It was picked up for coop gaming.

[h1]Early Access[/h1]
The game was in early access on Steam from May 2018 to June 2022.  During this time, I had heard of it but wasn’t following it in any way. 

[h1]The Good, the Bad and the Middle Ground[/h1]

[b]Good[/b][list]
[*]Raft building – straightforward and easy to do, minus the required resources
[*]Raft decoration – a decent number of options that can beautify the raft when resources permit 
[*]Coop – coop doesn’t have any bugs except for some lag when first connecting, very easy to join a friend’s game
[/list]

[b]Middle Ground[/b][list]
[*]Island exploration and diving – can be fun to explore the nooks and crannies of the islands and the undersea areas, but once you see the limited number of island variations it gets old fast
[*]Inventory management/size – very limited inventory size that slowly expands as you learn to make bigger backpacks, still very limited with the largest backpack
[*]Story – isn’t great, but enjoyable enough for a single playthrough
[/list] 

[b]Bad[/b][list]
[*]Tutorial – no tutorial about anything 
[*]Island variation – there is a very limited number of islands, once you see one it will repeat fairly often, each biome has a set of islands
[*]Island size – beyond the story islands, the islands aren’t big
[*]Shark – the shark is immediately around the raft when the game first loads and will start attacking you and the raft, the shark can destroy the raft before you make it to the first island
[*]Critters – some of the hostile wildlife is an absolute pain to deal with, a good number are also large damage sponges
[*]Resource gathering – resource gathering can be slow, often quite small quantities, late game resources are very limited
[*]Unharvestable resources – all the medium to big islands will have trees that can’t be harvested, there might be a couple harvestable trees among all the unharvestable ones, not worth the time to check all of them
[*]Resource grind – to unlock certain things you have to travel to certain biome islands, those islands may only have 1-2 resources of what you need when you need a lot more than that
[*]Boss fights – more about avoiding damage and dealing damage to a very spongey boss
[*]Survival – the food and water deplete quite fast even in the lighter survival modes
[*]Tool and gear wear – tools and gear wear out fast
[*]Second raft or rebuilding – once the shark destroys all the raft floats/foundations it can’t be rebuilt, can’t build a second raft  
[*]Replayability – no replayability, story is not worth a second playthrough and the survival loop wouldn’t be interesting enough for a second playthrough, limited island variation means you’d be revisiting all the places you have already seen multiple times over already
[*]Rare encounters and items – beyond rare, only saw 1-2 small ones over the course of playing
[/list] 

[h1]Game Modes[/h1]
The game has 5 game modes.
[list][*]Peaceful
[*]Easy
[*]Normal
[*]Hard
[*]Creative[/list] 
For a full description on game modes, see [url]https://raft.fandom.com/wiki/Game_Modes[/url]

[h1]Playtime[/h1]
With two players, it took about 40 hours, not in a rush, to get through and complete the story.

[h1]Recommendation[/h1]
As a coop game, I’d recommend it if you’re looking for a survival game that has a light story which offers an ending to the game.  Playing coop makes the experience better and you have someone to help with all the survival and combat tasks.  As a solo game, I’d avoid it."
5390,"I am a 45 yo father, probably one of the oldest people playing this game. I am a single farther to my Son, who is 14 now. My son got this game for Christmas in 2021 from his uncle, so we installed it on his computer and he started playing. By the end of the week he had 24 hours on this game. This was horrible for me, as it was already hard for me to find ways to spend time with my son, as he is always out with his friends or just watching YouTube. So I decided to make a Steam account and get this game to see if I could maybe play alongside him. I loaded into the game, picked my character and started playing but I was stuck on what you where supposed to do. I asked my Son for help and he hosted a game for me to join. I loved it as it was the best time I had spent with my Son since my wife had died. This game has ever since brought me and my son closer again and now we actually spend time together outside the house together as well. This game reminded me that there's fun to be had in everything, and it has brought both me and my Son many happy memories."

5409,"[h1]An interesting survival. Don't let the abounding colors fool you.[/h1]

[b]I didn't take it seriously a priori. ""children's amusement"" I thought. But it has turned out a correct, pleasant survival game.[/b]

[b]+[/b] Digital art (or concept art) is amazing. Combined with enjoyable sounds result in a wonderful experience.
[b]+[/b] Killer hips, bro! They know how to wiggle ^-^
[b]+[/b] There's this feeling, a sense of progress, a sense of achievement as the the player makes progress.

[b]-[/b] It got me anxiety at the beginning. So many things to worry about... and lack of orientation where to go, how or what to do first...
[b]-[/b] There is no skill tree system or a proper leveling system (just selling at a trader), which is a shame. This game is shaped to it.
[b]-[/b] I know jack about developing a game. But game saving upon death (even disabling auto save) sounds like an idea that came out of someone's butt. A nonsense thing. Perhaps making the information clear at the beginning of the game OR optional (for those who like to suffer) COULD BE a much better option.
[b]-[/b] Game forces you to be online in order to play. Do you play solo (like me) or simply want to play offline? Doesn't matter. A software limitation? A brain limitation? I don't know, it's just rare.
[b]-[/b] As many other survivals... this one gets you bored in less than 100 hours. And doesn't matter the previously sense of progress I mentioned before or your cooking, gardening, building passion: you'll get used to the game, to its mechanics. Even if you want the achievements, you'll suffer and maybe die of boredom. Or simply quit.
[b]-[/b] I love cooking in real life and I love my kitchen in the game but... I have more milk and eggs (2 chickens and 2 goats) and fruits that I can eat! More recipes maybe? A simple omelet? A mix of fruits?
The same for some items, we can't trade or sale them. WHY? Who knows.

I give it a 8.0/10.
A decent, enjoyable (and kinda addictive) survival."
5410,Fun survival game.
5411,"The first couple of hours are good, then it gets boring."
5412,This game is awesome!
5413,"An excellent example of an Early Access game that wasn't a cash grab. Devs have delivered on all their promises and then some. Final update has been a joy. Super fun, especially co-op. Very replayable. Worth $20 easily."
5414,terrifying but really fun
5415,good game
5416,"o, the shark"
5417,the big fish dont like me :steamhappy:
5418,"really good game, new updates are good, keep it up x"
5419,Extremely underrated
5420,"Oh...! Who lives on a physically unstable raft?
Trash grubbin' sea men!
Wet and hungry and half dead will you be?
Trash craftin' shark feed!
If a nautical loser be something you are?
Trash netting raft game!
Then download the game and get killed by a shark!
Don't forget the rock droppin' bird!
Ready?
Raft is a good game! As long as you know how to swim! The story ends with stupidity!
Playdough graphics... still cause lag! A-ha-ha-ha-ha!"
5421,DO NOT BUY THIS GAME its fun for the first few hours then its juts boring
5422,this game is so much fun
5423,good game. very raft.
5424,shark meat go brrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr
5425,shark
5426,7/10 needs more story
5427,This game is so well made and very addictive. You sail around initially and collect items from the ocean. You then get to discover different islands. There are thing everywhere to discover and you can really make the game your own. I enjoy being able to build my own raft and decorate it. It is such a great game and I would recommend it for everyone!
5428,It's okay-ish.
5429,snowmobile
5430,Linear. not much replayability. Unless you like crafting and trying to rebuild your raft better. Very fun.
5431,This is a beautiful relaxing game. I hope to see more games from his studio in the future.
5432,"Raft does Survival right. Progression always feels organic and rewarding, every upgrade is a meaningful step. The story is told through notes in a number of locations, all of which consist of semi-challenging parcour bits, puzzles or exploration. The puzzles especially never overstay their welcome and the game manages to throw something new at you all the time.
What I love most is probably the customization. There are tons of craftable or lootable decorations from simple furniture to playable instruments. The game never falls into the pithole of making base planning tedious, since everything can be picked up and replaced at any time. While this sounds miniscule on paper, it is actually something a lot of games miss, which greatly discourages decoration.
Additionally, while there is some grind, it never feels overwhelming.
Really the only downside i can think of is the lack of replayability. Once you finish the story, in my opinion, that's it. Apart from making an absolutely massive raft, there is nothing else to do. But until then you will have at least 40 hours of probably one of the top ten survival games out there."
5433,I LOVE THIS GAME  I JUST WISH I COULD PLAY WITH MORE PEOPLE INSTEAD OF JUST MY BROTHER
5434,hahahahhaa my chair smells so bad !
5435,"Raft is an amazing easy yet complex survival game set in a flooded world surrounded by Litter. You start with a hook and build you raft and collect resources. It is very replayable, the graphics are quite appealing and has up to 25 hours of gameplay per save! Definetly a must."
5436,i really like killing grace the shark
5437,I LIKE IT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
5438,este juego es muy bueno tiene una historia interesante  es divertido si jugas con amigos si te gusta la supervivencia esto es lo tullo
5439,AMAZING
5440,Very fun game to play I recommend.

5442,its fun
5443,Shark ate my ass :(
5444,"its a very fun game, hard at the start and better with friends"
5445,"great game, i can only hope they add more chapters."
5446,Great game would recommend...  the gameplay is smooth and easy to get a hold of.  multiplayer is also apart of the game so there's lots of opportunities for fun.
5447,me and blair.. on da boat.... against da world... stabbin bruce.... becomin gawarara
5448,i like men so this is a perfect experience for a man like myself. 10/10
5449,E
5450,"Really fun with friends for a while, but it gets really grindy, so turning to 3rd party mods for QoL stuff is the best option in my opinion. Wish the game had a steam workshop for easy mod access and management."
5451,The best game i played
5452,fun game.
5453,"Very chill game on the water, I have had a great time too. But Bruce is kinda of a dick"
5454,good game kinda boring
5455,"IN 3 DAY ...;/

5456,honestly good chill game thanks to mark wade and bob wouldnt have played this
5457,Game is fun
5458,Super Fun!
5459,no
5460,Fun little game to play with friends who can join and leave
5461,I KEEP RUNNING OUT OF FUCKING PLASTIC
5462,"its a good take on the survival style genre. simple but difficult
"
5463,"well, the game is quite fun, but the problem is I just completely lost my boat, and there is simply no way I can get it back except if i were to kill myself. I would usually recommend it but really the fact that you can have your boat simply dissapear while you are at an island or in the middle of the ocean makes the game overall unplayable for me mainly because of the stress of you losing an entire game because of a silly thing."
5464,its just a good single and multi player game its fun and has a lot of story to it so it makes u want to finish the game i would suggest to get this game
5465,dont tie
5466,I got this game to see how it was ever since i got it i have been playin
5467,"Fun to play with friends
"
5468,i just wish it was longer :/ i could play this game forever if there was a longer storyline. cant wait to see if they release more.
5469,ngl games below mid. just another survival game

5474,Big dogs only
5475,fun but grind
5476,"A very fun game to play with friends, laughed many times. Don't take this game too serious.

This game can be tedious at times, but is mostly very relaxing, the music helps with that.

Would like to see more content of this game!"
5477,"It is So much fun that it make me happy, when i didnt have it, i've been sad, but when i got this, I was happy and excited"
5478,iha kiva

5487,the quest line is amazing
5488,"great game to play with the bois

5489,raft is very different from other ocean survival games because of the story which i like
5490,very easy if you put game start a lot of collection nets

Chilling and floating on the ocean or exploring islands ist just entertaining .

Even better with friends btw :)"
5531,Extremely fun game to play solo lots of stuff to do I like that you can do creative mode where all you do is make your ship with unlimited supplies.  You can do peaceful mode where the creatures dont attack you but you can still attack them making the game easier for new people or people playing by themselves
5532,"The kind of game that makes you wish it would go on forever. Can get a little repetitive with the same islands over and over, but it's fun to play with friends."
5533,Open World base building survival game!

5535,its hentai

5537,"planks planks planks, I need more planks. O fuck, the shark. GOD DAMN IT!
I'm starving, need foods FAST. Dehydrated too? COME ON!
...Okay, got all that fixed, time to go back to building around my raft :)
Wait? We need more resources? Ugh, fine.
...Hey, this game is actually kinda relaxing :))
*comes across a big island and gets double decked by a fucking bird and boar*
Fuck this game >:((

5540,"Great survival game, much better with a crew. I love it"
5541,i play this game to simulate shark poaching
5542,"early-mid game is fun but everything after that is boring, repetitive, and tedious."
5543,the best game I ever played
5544,"This game is highly addictive and very fun to play with friends. It can take a bit of time to figure out the basics, but once you have a system down, there's lots of fun to be had. From fishing, to crafting, to building up the raft, there's plenty of creativity and things to be discovered. You'll play this game for hours; definitely get your money's worth."
5545,"me kill shark, me wear shark, me eat shark"
5546,hi this is jase
5547,its slow at first but picks up then its get good
5548,Great game
5549,Best game ever just get it
5550,"cool game
"
5551,not bad. fun with friends.
5552,"OKAY. This game is so worth the money but also kind of not at the same time.. Like, it's a wonderful game, I love it, but it's just so broken that 20€ seems like a bit [strike] too [/strike] much for it. The lore behind everything is so good and all the things you can make and decorate with are great but PLEASE fix the GODDAMN water glitching on top of the raft and the raft almost turning over as soon as i hit alt tab for ONE SECOND and in general... so so many more glitches to count... Glitching under the raft/sand, the hook not working once you launch a new world unless you throw it and grab it again, the raft glitching underwater and almost doing a full on 180, thrown items glitching through the floor and ending up in god knows where, AND PLEASE I BEG FIX THE ANIMAL CORPSES SLIPPIN N' GLITCHING ALL OVER AND IN THE GROUND AND NOT LETTING ME GRAB THE SHIT FROM THEM LIKE  G O D A M N ... Anyway, I still love this game and will continue to do so, i recommend, but FIX THE BUGS PLEASE AND THANK YOU <3"
5553,"This game is so much fun! You can play with friends or by yourself. There is an interesting story, and so many creative tools to make a fun raft. So many different styles of play are supported. This game is a game for everyone."
5554,"This game has SO MUCH potential it's insane! So far it has been one of my favorite games to play solo, since most of my friends aren't playing it. I could imagine it would be super fun with others too, but believe me when I say that this game is FUN, solo or otherwise. I turned the music off, and made sure all the effects and other sounds were turned up to the max, and let me tell you I about pooped my pants the first time the shark attacked my raft. The sounds are so good! This game is well worth the money!! 10/10"
5555,"Really enjoyable playing style if you are into collecting items to become more efficient to collect items in order to survive more easily and therefore having much more time to do fun stuff like taking revenge on all the enemies that fu*#ed you up when you were a noobie, spend your easy to get but valuable resources to have emergency equipment, food and armor, either way, sorry for my English but at the end i just like this game very much. 

10/10 recommend."

5557,this game is so freaking slow and boring you won't even know you feel asleep till you wake up and its still a boring af game.

5566,"decent crafting game. slow at points but pretty relaxing on easy mode, standard difficulty can be frustrating early game. either way it has a good crafting system and enough map to explore."

5581,Fun addictive game.
5582,Best ive played in awhile
5583,vary gooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooood
5584,"A really nice game, but not for me.
I found the story rather boring. Sure, you can build a cool raft. But other systems like farming crops and animals, or cooking, are somewhat limited. Important ingredients like mushrooms are quite rare and can only be found in caves on certain islands. And there is barely any use for some of the resources yet, so things like clay bowls or buckets are used up in cooking. Which doesn't make sense, but I guess it generates a need to gather those resources anew to create new ones.

Yes, I really like the food and farming part in survival games. And this game sucks in those areas.

Too bad none of my friends play Don't Starve together anymore. I guess they prefer having to deal with a shark every 5 minutes instead of the occasional tree guard."
5585,"wow
"
5586,FUN.
5587,It's better than Call of Duty: Ghosts.
5588,FUN
5589,good + good
5590,big shark bad
5591,"Starts great, but the ending is clearly rushed. There are recycled puzzles on the last island, game feels empty."
5592,"I really enjoyed playing raft, I teamed up together with a friend and we've had plenty hours of fun grinding equipment, building, exploring.  we were both going for 100% completion on the achievements but at the last story achievement only the host got the achievement, which means my buddy has to redo the whole story if he wanted to get 100% completion, which is kinda a bummer, Also i think you should get the titanium tools before the last story quest, otherwise the only use for them is grinding your last achievements... Rate 8/10 would recommend"
5593,very good game
5594,an addicting survival game that you wont wanna stop playing
5595,"hard as hell....but to me, that makes it fun as shit! really rewarding watching all your work come together!"

5598,its so fun and chalegeing
5599,all hail the wet brick.
5600,i would not survive  on a real raft
5601,Very good game sometimes boring to play for more than 3 hours but after a lil break its fun to play again. Lots of content and islands to discover i give it 8/10
5602,good game
5603,"hello im under the water
"
5604,epic game very fun
5605,Dumbass Bruce
5606,Congrats for completely ruining a good and relaxing story sandbox with a frustrating skillgame at the end.
5607,"In the game I had to eat and drink waaaay too often, so I couldn't enjoy the game - which was difficult to food and clean water get in the first place, because it's a hard survival. I didn't have so much other time to do other more fun things in the game like building and exploring."
5608,"Lots of water , cant drink it , very hungry , shark bad , trash good"
5609,"Fun game, but it takes all of your attention."
5610,"Oh look, a shark!  

Ah!  

AAAH!  A SHARK!  It's HUNGRY!  

I'm hungry... there's no food... oh... wait, this is raw... do I eat this?  Will it make me sick?

Not very filling... now I'm thirsty... 

This game is great!  It can be fun, casual, and relaxing, or it can be hectic and frustrating, but still fun.

Get it!  Play it!  Go nuts!"
5611,just watch aphmaus raft videos on youtube to see how good this game is
5612,good

5639,"Game is fun for the first while but in the game there are like land masses such as islands and like oil rigs and things like that, and it becomes so frustrating when you get to the land because i experience frame drops and its also just not fun and its impossible to figure out without using the online wiki which basically ruins the fun of the game, the game does a good job of being on a raft as it is literally called that but it becomes extremely frustrating when you try to do anything else"
5640,It's a very fun game and def worth the 20$. If you enjoy Minecraft you'll enjoy this lol. They're fairly similar but different at the same time. It's really fun!
5641,Raft is A very enjoyable game
5642,"Initially I was just atrocious at this game. (I was brand new to survival games in general when I started Raft.) I sucked at aiming my hook to get supplies fast enough. I didn't know which supplies to prioritize and what to build. I had no idea how to deal with Bruce (the shark). I had to go from normal, to easy, to creative. Then things started clicking. 

I switched back to normal once I had the controls and basic mechanics down and I found that far more fun than creative once I knew what to do. I was hooked. (Just accept the bad pun.)

You start with close to nothing and unlike most survival games you can't freely explore the world to find what you need. You are stranded on a very small raft in the ocean and oddly enough you are lucky it's been heavily littered in. You have a single hook with the rope that you can cast out to gather pieces of litter; plastic scraps, planks of wood, palm leaves, and the ever desirable barrels. You need to move quickly when you start to expand your raft, create basic survival tools, and utilize said tools as your thirst and hunger deplete quickly and there is an obsessive shark trying to eat you who will destroy your raft given a chance. 

I highly advise creating a second hook (always have a second hook) and expanding your raft before building anything else.  The shark always attacks the edge pieces of your raft. If your equipment can be placed on center pieces it won't get destroyed by the shark if you don't defend your raft quickly enough. A water purifier and plastic cup are needed for thirst. A fishing pole is needed to get fish, A planter is needed for growing veggies. A grill is needed to cook. Once you can refill your thirst and hunger  the research table is key. You need it to learn new items to build based on the resources you find. 

Eventually you will gather enough resources to start crafting things like an anchor. This will let you be able to stop at islands you float near without your raft leaving you behind.  Most of the resources you need are actually under the water at the islands, but you have to deal with the shark who really wants to chomp on you. You have several options. You can craft shark bait that will keep the shark occupied for a limited period of time. You can kill the shark (time your attacks to match the sharks and you'll avoid damage) and have a longer period of time to explore freely until it respawns. Lastly you can set the anchor fairly far from the island and swim like crazy for land. Unless it is actively attacking you, the shark is actually orbiting your raft rather than you. Thus once you touch land the shark will default back to orbiting raft. (Give it enough time to swim away before reentering the water.) You do have to risk being attacked on your way back to the raft, but you will be able to explore the sea around the island worry free (minus puffer fish). 

Side Note: Don't bother with flower seeds if you are struggling with storage early in the game. You can get more than enough of them later on.

A sail will greatly increase your freedom to travel the world. While you can't go directly against the wind you can now get to islands you raft would have floated past greatly increasing the supplies you can find. 

Eventually you will find blueprints to build antenna and radar. Crafting those is what starts the actually story of Raft and you'll have goals beyond survival. 

I'm not going to go into the story as I think wondering about it and learning it on your own is half the fun. I just wanted to give a basic overview of starting the game and I honestly think starting this game is the hardest part; especially if you are new to this type of game. 

You will find larger islands that have rare resources and be able to capture animals to have on your ship. 
You'll make more advanced gear that will let you explore deeper in the ocean. You'll be able to automate certain processes like watering crops. You'll get to explore places where people obviously lived and learn about what happened. You'll find the most obnoxious bird enemy. You'll be able to motorize your raft giving you the ability go anywhere regardless of the wind's direction. There is a nice feeling progression in regards to what you have and can do. 

Last but not least you can paint your raft. I love being able to customize my base/raft. :)"
5643,"I would never play this game alone, just with friends. It is hard to stay motivated here (for me, personally), but as a relaxing game to play when you want to turn your head off, it is good."
5644,big raft
5645,"It requires grinding throughout the game, but its really fun.
Im also no where near done the story, but so far its really interesting!"
5646,"The game is good at the start, BUT when you come to the late game it't not event survival. The end is literally only puzzels, yes puzzels in the SURVIVAL game. We waiter 4 YEARS for the full realese and there is still plenty of bugs like: Water glitching trough the raft. I don't want to talk about the AI, because it's a long story how bad they're. If you want to play with a Survival game, then i can recommend: The Forest, ARK:Survival Evolved, Green Hell. Sadly i can't refund this trash.

Graphics: 4/10
Optimization: 5/10
Grinding: 4/10 (you need to grind a lot)
Survival: 4/10 (half of the game is survival the other half is just PUZZELS)
Fun: 5/10
Money worth: 1/10 (atleast it's not 60 eur)
Story: 7/10
Overall: 4/10
"
5647,"+ Nice graphics, music, environment.
+ Adjustable challenge.
+ Many options to build your own Titanic.
- Giant birds are stupid annoying abominations.
- Relatively small world.
- Too few islands.
- No titanium spear.
- Lack of weapon choices.
- Lack of unique minor encounters.
- After beating the main story, the game does not provide enough options for exploring forward: only looking for a few islands & items.

Conclusions: a nice game to spend several dozens hours. If play solo select simple or creative mode, because of the normal+ difficulties are intended for co-op. The game main focus is on building your own raft, neither on storytelling or displaying to you amazing world."
5648,good game you should play
5649,it good
5650,its fun
5651,"easy going, does have a big learning curve great for new and experienced players"
5652,It is very fun and you can play free for all and storyline which is very fun I bought it on sale for 8 dollors but would pay the 20 dollars
5653,this game is amazing but i would only recommend this game for patient players as the game is a grindy game and needs high vigalence
5654,45
5655,This game is really fun with friends and excels this ways more than others .A group of friends can really enjoy this game alot more then single player but is still fun and a challenge in this way which will still get done .Really enjoying this game and will be playing some nice hours in this.
5656,good game
5657,For me this game is fun and relaxing. I've literally lost hours playing this game. Now if they would implement a sort for your main inventory that would be nice. :)
5658,Great game if you like the grind looking forward to solving the mystery now that I'm not dying every minutes:-)

5671,Its rare that developers really update a released game. And this one is a beautiful one!
5672,this is one of the best games ive ever played it was a pleasure to go through the journey.
5673,Shark is annoying.
5674,"First game I've tried to get a refund for, rejected. Game is boring as hell. I tried, I really did, but it's just no fun. I'm no stranger to the grind but this game has maybe 3 things to survive, 3 things that happen over and over and over. In between you are subjected to some of the most poorly written ""story"" I've experienced. Maybe multiplayer would be more fun, but then I'd have to subject a friend to this drivel, and I just don't have that many friends that I can afford to have one hate me for the rest of their lives.

Survivors, you have been warned."

5685,better games out there that last longer than seven odd missions. if theres no updates or more levels added to it in the future it aint worth playing

5687,bruce
5688,"Raft, although a bit choppy in the animation at times, is an EXCELLENT game if you're looking for survival and multiplayer survival, as well as a unique creative outlet. Me and my boyfriend play this together, even though I'm not very good at it. We named the shark Karen, for obvious reasons. 
I gotta say my favorite part about this is the room to have fun with the world around you and the people you play with. My second favorite part is the creative mode, which is great if you just want to vibe on the ocean and just create to your heart's content. 

I highly recommend for people who like or fear the ocean and want to interact with other players."

5707,"Final island is a load of garbage, final boss fight is not fun or well written. So much for the 'Final' chapter, completely ruined the whole thing for me. Nothing like stacking boxes while getting swarmed by enemies that constantly grapple you, while fire bombs rain from the sky. Whole thing was a nuisance, and buggy as hell."
5708,very fun game once u get use to the mechanics

5715,"Debated getting this game for a few months. Finally pulled the trigger an glad I did. I play solo, normally at work when not on calls(EMS). It took roughly 30 hours for me to finish the storyline. Once finished I still had around 65 achevements left to chase. Game was harder to understand than I orginally thought an found myself looking at walkthroughs an guides to figure simple things out. Fun game well worth 20$."
5716,Fun and Relaxing!
5717,"I like the adventure and the things you can make. You can make the coolest raft ever, explore small and big islands, fight mobs, and play with friends! The bad thing is that it will get boring after completing the game and there should be more furniture."
5718,Considering the fact I've played over 300 hours I'd say it goes without saying I recommend this game

5726,Really fun survival game
5727,it is a very good game for if you need to calm down would recommend
5728,Not even that far in and i'm having a damn blast. Playing with a buddy or playing solo I enjoy it 100% of the time
5729,fun survival game but can be very frustrating. but then again most survival games can be. it has lots of content and will provide many hours of fun.
5730,"A few puzzles that were a bit dumb, but otherwise overall a great game. The only mechanic I wish it had was placement pickup for raft pieces. Or maybe just like a chance to pick it up without it breaking. As I played, I build as I went. It didn't look horrible, but I did not want to waste material on making it look better even after I finished the story because it takes quite a while to gather the resources for a multi engine raft. I had fun playing by myself as well as with friends. There is a bunch more I would like to do, but I will most likely slow down how often I play since I can't rebuild my boat easily. I do recommend. Great time waster."

5737,sick game
5738,"Game is pretty good, the one thing i would like to add is there to be more bigger islands. sure theres alot but its just smol islands. also when you get to your coordinates, i feel like it drags by the fetch quests, but i guess its good at the same way. Because the game is jus water so it make sence."

5777,"I really enjoyed raft. I found the game to be a really relaxing experience, especially once you get your raft fully armored and don't have to worry about the shark. The gameplay loop is fun and really forgiving, especially if you play on easy. If you're looking for a really chill experience by yourself or with some pals, this game is a great choice. However, it's far from perfect.

My biggest complaint is with how quickly tools degrade. They go by QUICK, which is really frustrating given how often you're going to have to be using them. Because of this, it's not very tempting to make the end-game tools given how expensive they are. Additionally, I found the third act to be... Strange. The game has an extremely sharp change in tone and pace on the final island. I can confidently say that if the changes that occurred on the final island occurred even one island earlier, I wouldn't have finished the game. It's such a stark departure from what the game has been for the past forty hours, and definitely for the worse.

That being said, once you're done there, you don't have to go back and it can be safely ignored. I don't think that it should keep you from trying the game, but maybe have a guide at the ready if you find that the puzzles are a little obtuse.

Overall, Raft is a really good game. I enjoyed the premise and most of the execution. Outside of harvesting hitboxes the game is fairly free of bugs and runs well enough. Despite its flaws I'd say that Raft is well worth the full price."
5778,shork
5779,"It's a bit clutchy ( you could argued that it is a good thing) a bit too much for my taste. Nonetheless, it's a decent game with interesting mechanics for a well priced game.  
 3.5 of 5 would be my rating. Enjoy!"
5780,"Fun til chapter 3 then the game jumps the shark. Braindead story, awful boss mechanics, and tedious puzzles ruin it."
5781,BRUCE
5782,If you don't like water this isn't for you. But if you like any video game ever play this one
5783,Very fun take on survival genre.  Its fun going from a small wooden raft to a giant sea mansion.

5793,Its a really fun game a lot to do and not boring
5794,"started to play this game when there were only 2 chapters, first try was a flop as i couldnt catch garbage and other resources fast and create tools and shark also attached me non-stop so my raft was totally destroyed and i died like in 10 min of game or so hahaha. second attempt was much better and i finished these 2 available chapters pretty fast. Didnt play Raft for a very long time and was very happy when got notification that Final chapter was out. Remembering some struggle with sharks and birds throwing stones at you, rats and all...i decided to play relaxing mode, for lazy people)))you still see all the mosters but they just casually walk/swim/fly around. U can still attack and kill them but need to be careful as they can kick your ass in response, but its only about Boar and bears probably (didnt try, didnt wanna die), sharks and puffer fish, they dont care at all, so if you need meat or gel  - they wouldnt mind to die)))) now i am on the way to one of the last islands i believe, so lets see, i am very curious what would be the end of the story. So i can definitelly recommend that game, i have 30-34 hours and still not bored at all."
5795,"Fun game, building thangs and killin thangs"

The game play is good, the new locations you find are good the difficulty of puzzles is challenging but it  is also such a relaxing game to sit and chill on would 100% recommend for you to play with your Friends"

The devs have passion, for sure, but at this point I'm wondering if that passions directed at making a fun indie game or at making me take my own life. Maybe I'm being harsh, but fuck this game."

"
5826,"This game is fun if a bit Raft-roaded at times.

Basically you have an infinite ocean (about 3-5 KM actually) where you can go in any direction provided you have the means of propulsion to get you there. You gather resources from the water first with a hook on a rope, then later with nets attached to your raft. As you gain blueprints and research items the game becomes less grind focused and more story based. Th story is welcome and adds a finale to the game something some other survival games seem to lack."
5827,this game is amaaazing with pretty much everything the only thing that i found is you can some times clip threw islands only the large ones with lakes tho sooo yeah if you really like the survival open world sort of game then this is for you.
5828,fun
5829,cool
5830,"Raft is a good survival game with plenty of challenge and fun, until it turns into an awful platformer then action/adventure game with wonky movement/combat mechanics that are more frustrating than it's worth it to continue playing. At least solo. As of now, I've given up. I'm near the end and feel like nothing I did earlier prepared me for the end game except that I needed lots and lots of food and water to endure the torture."
5831,Superb game that is so much fun playing solo or with friends!

5833,"For a game called ""Raft,"" you sure don't spend a whole lot of time there.

When you're actually [i]on the raft,[/i] Raft is pretty good. Unfortunately, a significant portion of the game is spent wandering aimlessly around set piece environments that are way too large, with way too many enemies that are way too hard to kill. Typically each new area involves nonsensical ""puzzles,"" first-person platforming, and prop hunt fetch quests to find X number of whatever arbitrary macguffin is necessary to proceed with the story; itself a paper-thin attempt to string together totally unrelated locations and make it into some kind of eco-socio-political narrative.

You have to progress the plot to unlock new raft build options, but by the end of the game your beloved floating home will be reduced to an anchored manufacturing facility, solely existing to produce supplies for a series of incredibly tedious arena puzzles and annoying fight scenes.

I've played Raft from its earliest iterations, alone and with friends. When it's not trying to be a knockoff of Subnautica or The Witness, it's decent fun. It's unfortunate that the final product strayed so far from the core gameplay that made it unique and enjoyable in the first place."
5834,Would rate 10/10 but I will only give it an 8/10 because the sharks are mean. Other than that they should have named it Trash Collecting SIm.
5835,"its fun with friends
 recomended if you have friends 
 side effects are: might not be able to touch grass again"
5836,The puzzles are fun but it feels really grindy in the early stages
5837,;)
5838,"So... this game was fun, for the first 10 hours or so. After you beat the game, and if you are planning to complete this game 100%, your nightmare will begin as you keep running in circles, doing the same thing for the hundredth time."

5845,"My hubby and I have packed many hours into this game. Love the survival and adventure aspect. Feels like there is always something to do, and we both have something we can focus on while the other is busy with something else.

5893,"9/10 

Perfect game to drift around with friends and a true Indy gem. 

Only downside is it eventually ends and there's not much to do after it does, but the journey is fantastic.

Highly immersive atmosphere, interesting and varied puzzles / platforming and deceptively robust base building tools.

Set sail and keep an ear out for the f****ing shark! o7"
5894,This is definitely a game. 10 out of 10
5895,"This game is amazing! Have spent so much time customizing rafts and decorating. If you are into survival/base building, this is a must have. The team at Redbeet Interactive have really done a fantastic job. Your entire game revolves around your raft, and you progress by visiting islands/other destinations. You also get a pet shark named Bruce to keep you company along the way."
5896,w
5897,"pog champ

"
5898,"This game is quite fun, but it could use some more polish. I hope the devs refine it, because they could elevate it from a good game to a great game.


[b]Some things that could be improved:[/b]

- Single player -- there is no dedicated single-player mode. If you are incapacitated on normal setting, you have to forfeit 2/3 of your equipment or have a friend come rescue you. If you are incapacitated on hard setting, you must have someone come save you or start a new game. Going back to a previous save only reverts the world; your character will still be incapacitated.

- If there is a decoration item on a wall and the wall is destroyed, the decoration item is also destroyed.

- Building in general -- some pieces refuse to show as able to be built, despite having adequate support nearby. Additional support needs to be built and later destroyed.

- Sitting on furniture.

- Island variety.

- More island resources -- Many islands have things that look like they should be gatherable, but are not. Abandoned structures cannot be deconstructed for materials. It's a shame that the devs went through the effort to make these assets just for decoration. Some examples are bamboo, oil barrels, miscellaneous building supplies scattered around, other rafts and shelters.

-[spoiler] Equipment that requires titanium is largely useless. By the time all the blueprints have been acquired, the story has been completed. The game is super stingy with titanium drops as well. I was only able to build one or two items before I completed the story. Be prepared to grind.[/spoiler]"
5899,"*final release* 

- I would still recommend this to anyone who likes survival craft with an ocean setting... just get it on a sale or if you REALLY love survival craft. I liked the new creatures added in for flavor and it made the ocean seem a bit more lively. I still enjoy the mechanics of build and collection. It's unique and still interesting to me even after finishing the story line. I find myself just floating about and working on my raft.

The story added in was ok, but it wasn't great. I think I would have liked a story line that gave me more reason to be involved. I really felt like I had no stake in the story... the later recipes require too much rare materials to warrant using them. I didn't care for the jumping puzzles... those parkour puzzles are just not my cup of tea. 

Some things in build are a bit OP and can be used to glitch into places  without solving puzzles and I came across a couple crummy bugs and glitchy ai  that made it hard to figure out if it was a bug or intended and I didn't know what to do with them. 

I would give it a sideways thumb if I could... but I can't. So, recommended, but maybe wait for a sale or get it if you just flat love survival craft.

*early access* 

- It's a creative survival story based in the ocean. If you like oceans, building and survival. It's got several difficulty modes, so you can play the way you want and online coop and they finished the story. 

There's even a mode for people who like the ocean, but get seasick from the motion."

5930,I've never seen a game punish you so bad for playing alone. Sorry i don't have friends to play with but 2/3 of my inventory when i'm killed by a stupid bird and i cant even fight back.
5931,"Spent the first 12 hours wondering if I even liked the game or not, and then I realised I'd been playing for 12 hours and that kinda answered the question for me.

Early game is unforgiving, and may occasionally cheese you out of valuable materials - The loss of which can be extremely frustrating. But once you get the ""conveyor belt"" going, and the story starts unfolding, you'll find yourself playing for ""15 minutes"" and stopping 4 hours later."

5948,"this game is amazing. if you love open world games this game is for you, however if you love games with a story this is also for you. the mix of being able to create your own personal raft while also following the story is amazing. you can choose when you are ready to move on to each section of the story. there are many achievements avalable and alot of suprises. the game being co op is also a bonus and me and my boyfriend love it.

the price of the game is a bonus as not many games would offer this much fun and content for less than 15 pounds. the graphics are great and raft just makes you feel as through you truly are exploring a new world. this game is great for anybody and everybody. overall it is extremly calming."

5972,"Fun self paced game.  As you progress, you intuitively identify ways to teach yourself or move forward with new strategies and abilities.  As you make each step, it is rewarding to know you solved the problems.  It's a well-designed strategy game."
5973,"Love this game and always play it now and then! Great survival game, though it is a lot harder playing alone because of how annoying the shark is always attacking your raft. My major complaint was the varuna point chapter. (minor spoilers) Constantly crafting more flippers and oxygen bottles was so frustrating had to leave and gather more seaweed alot. Horrible horrible chapter in a game where your surrounded by water make swimming not horrible please. But overall this game is great."

I shouldn't need to feed myself 15 times in a single day and i shouldn't need to drink 100 oz. of water every single day its not realistic or even slightly believable. I find myself spending more time getting food and water then doing literally anything else in the game even when i cheat i still end up playing a food and water gathering sim. its bull i wanna play a survival game but not a game that forces so much food and water to be consumed. if the ocean slowly depleted every time you pulled water from it, I'm fairly sure that the entire world would be dry by day 1000"

5990,Who would've thought that fighting to stay alive every second of the day could be so addicting. The art style is nice too.
5991,GOOD
5992,"This game ruined my friendship with my best friend of 10 years! The game starts off strong, it’s very engaging and challenging, and every new recipe learned feels like a big step forward. Unfortunately, by the time you reach the 3rd island, you’ve spent 80% of the time just grinding, grinding, grinding. Every piece of item you have breaks incredibly fast, and has to be rebuilt, instead of just being able to repair them using fewer resources. The shark becomes less than a challenge, and can easily be killed by 1 person over and over without taking any damage, and the sense of progression is completely gone. Me and my friend, who have stuck together through thick and thin for 10 years, finally got to the fabled “bear island”. We were excited to finally be off the raft and explore a large landmass covered in trees and foliage. Unfortunately the pacing, level design and enemy encounters were so poorly made it made us literally vomit. The “puzzles” overall is a joke, and don’t get me started on the voice acting and “writing”. As stated before, me and my friend have been best friends for 10 years, laughed and cried together, shared milestones in our lives with one another, and this game broke our spirits so much we haven’t talked since we rage quit playing halfway through the 3rd island."

5999,a great dventure
6000,"The ending was kinda empty I thought I was gonna see a story of why there is water everywhere. The fighting mechanic can be better. The gameplay like building, crafting and hooking resources is really unique and I really enjoyed it! I played it mostly solo but multplier seems to be the main focus of the game that's why it's built around it. The best experience I had is building my boat from scratch so if you like creating stuff this is the game for you! It keeps you entertained with the story and it's not very repetitive because there are so many biomes to play around and puzzles to solve on the main story. I hope there are gonna be new updates like adding new items in the minishop,new engine to go faster and etc!"
6001,"I cannot really complain about anything EXCEPT the game is just too slow. After 14 hours, I have a raft with radio and full inventory, but no goal to work for. I have heard there is a game story in there somewhere, but I have seen very little of it. I discovered a floating base that gives a little flesh to a story, but after that there is nothing to go on for the next step. I can understand an hour or two but not 14 and the main story has just barely started. My only conclusion is it is a waste of time. I will not waste any more time gathering resources with no end in sight. 25/100"

6010,"You can die in the stupidest of ways and you have to sacrifice 2/3 of your inventory after just filling up on all kinds of resources, basically losing everything you've just gathered in your inventory and to top it all off it saves the game after you die instead of letting you load a quicksave."
6011,i love raft and highly recommend it for anyone looking to kill time over the summer. its so easy to grind and is good for anyone looking for a casual game. Raft is best enjoyed with friends but its fun either way
6012,"I wish there was a ""maybe"" button. Like I really loved the raft building creativity aspect, I am proud how my raft turned out, but the chapter 3 story was disappointing. I was more excited to find a new recipe than rescuing playable characters, especially when I had to return back to the explored areas. 
Also, who would think, that it's a good idea to make and achievement ""kill 50 anglers"" or ""screechers"" and etc, like you have to visit the same place over and over and over again. That's just lazy writing. The game had a lot of potential, but the writers got lazy."

It took me a second to get into the game, but I guess that's the case with any new game.

Pro:
- fun story
- right amount of diversity in scenery and content
- a good amount of buildable and customizable content
- the coop-feature is nice (I played it almost exclusively in coop)

Con:
- jump & run parts were a little annoying
- for some reason, the game wasn't able to switch audio sources in-game. So when switching to my headphones, I had to restart the game entirely. This might change over time ofc

All in all a really fun time! I sincerely recommend this game."

6052,"Good survival game who's lack of emphasis on the most engaging parts of the game forbid it from being great. Eat, Drink, Collect Garbage, Expand, Stab Shark, Repeat; the most basic way to explain the experience of this game. Unfortunately, fleshing out these fundamental activities was not a prioritized in favor of other more fleeting aspects of the game like the numerous narrative ""playgrounds"".

Progression is the simplest way to lay out my problems with this game. Things start out in their most gratifying form: collecting new items, and researching what they are. When you 'Research' an item, it consumes it, but unlocks all recipes that involve that item, provided you have researched all it's other components. It was a lot of fun to scoop up something new out of the ocean or from an island and take it to the research table to see what new shiny thing I could craft to enrich my raft with various crafting stations, storage solutions, or decor, as well as new tools to wield, which in turn allowed for the harvest of more new materials to research. Sadly, this honeymoon period doesn't last as fewer and fewer researchable materials will find their way to the raft, and all the new shiny contraptions and tools instead come from blueprints found within one of several narrative-centric zones.
This means that if you want to build the best rafting experience for yourself, you will reach a point where the only way to progress your technology further is to sail straight lines between each of these story driven puzzle rooms scattered across the ocean. Especially once a new material is introduced after one of these sections, you will hardly have time to gather any of it and apply it to your raft before you have arrived at your next story location. The truly worst part of this system for me was that its only after beating the game and watching the credits roll that you get blueprints to make improved versions of practically every tool in the game. I never continued onward to find out just how improved these tools are, but if they lasted even 25% longer, it would have been a godsend. Which leads me to my 2nd biggest gripe, and one of my overall biggest gripes with survival games as a whole....

Durability. Sure, a wall should crumble if it takes too much damage, perhaps even armor should crack with use. But the #1 offender for ""hours of gameplay added due to things that aren't fun"" is the fact that every tool (besides a small few) in the game will break with use and cannot be repaired. Catch 20 fish, chop 20 trees, dig 20 times; tool broken, make a new one. Eat some soup? The bowl you made for it is gone. Drink a smoothie? Now the glass is gone too. Every one of these things breaking means needing to -in most cases- target farm a particular resource, which may even need to be refined after the fact, in order to replace restock your tool-belt. I personally would have loved to have used more of my resources to decorate my raft, but every light fixture or couch meant resources I spent time to get that I'll desperately need the next time my spear snaps.

These two aspects truly make it hard to leave this as a positive recommendation, but I really do recommend it. The story is serviceable, the 'chores' of living on a raft are decently gratifying, and the freedom of decorating your raft really lets you get creative and build out a vision of your ideal garbage-collecting houseboat. And it all gets better when you add a friend or two."
6053,build boat. kill pufferfish. get goo. capture goat
6054,It's OK... but that is it.  normal mode that shark gets old... like really old. so I spent most of the time in easy mode just so I could enjoy the game. There are better ways of making things challenging than using the same old shark. the came could be great... not just good. I'm only putting a thumbs down to hopefully get the devs attention
6055,Very fun game + very cool story.
6056,fun game
6057,shit final updates
6058,"Hooking, Kill the shark, Finding resources, Treasure hunt in the Island, Olof is the main villain"
6059,"A pretty fun and chill little survival game! I had a lot of fun playing co-op with my wife. Don't rush through the story; this is very much a ""journey, not the destination"" kind of game."
6060,great game!
6061,Too much water
6062,good good game. me like
6063,IZ GOOD. WATCH YOUR FAVORITE UTUBER PLAY IT.
6064,Super fun and even more fun with friends. I'm so excited to start playing again now that the game is finished!
6065,"This game has so much more to offer than meets the eye. On the surface it looks like a typical survival crafting game. The survival aspect is simple, and then the game gives a wonderful and satisfying progression as the story unfolds."
6066,"This is, in my opinion one of the most relaxing games ever, some might even call it the minecraft of the seas but nonetheless it is a great game for 20 bucks. again one of the best games."
6067,Played it through multiple releases and have enjoyed every iteration!
6068,This game is easy enough for most players with some really good puzzle and jumping aspects. The story made the game so much more fun.
6069,Survival and crafting. What's not to like?
6070,fish in the water are yummy
6071,it can be very fun early game and watching your raft grow it is more of a targeted game though as most games are where you would have to enjoy this type of game to like it but overall a very enjoyable game
6072,GOOD:)

6074,cool game :)
6075,"I'm really enjoying this game.  It has something for everyone; resource gathering, building, decorating, a story line. Really enjoy playing and streaming this game."

6078,"Everyone knows this is a close to perfect game
Well worth whatever you spent for it."
6079,I very much like this game. I got It when it 1st came out and couldn't play it because of how buggy it was. A lot of love went into this game. It is really awesome and it has a ending now.

6085,It's like a minecraft on the ocean with a nice questline. I really enjoyed this game.
6086,This is a great game and i hope the release more updates
6087,"I would like to start out by saying I have played it through.  I'm not sure how folks on YouTube and Twitch make a full season out of this game.  Very short in nature maybe 2 weeks in all.  Spoilers incoming.

Pro's:
- Game is enjoyable
- Story mode is a refreshing addition to the crafting world
- Crafting does help the player live a bit easier
- They added a non existent merchant
- Story helps push the player through the game
- Different areas really broke up the game play
- Merchant seems to hold additional game items
- The pace keeps the player engaged
- North pole (ice biome) was really cool

Con's:
- To many restrictions around the raft
- Hunger and water are the main confrontations
- Limited resources
- If you lose the raft game over
- Unable to build down
- No real combat system
- Combat does appear to be glitchy
- The developer missed a ton of opportunities to use areas better than they did
- A lot of miss opportunities within the game
- Radar has to be on at least the a second floor?  Why?
- Quality of items only seem to account for durability?
- Once in the main story hunting down new tech overrides island hoping
- Smoothies make cantina useless
- Ending was a bit of let down
- Titanium weapons at the very end?  Why?
- Once Oloff is defeated no real reason to continue playing

Over all I enjoyed the game.  The zero ramp up time in the beginning sucks, and almost discouraged me to continuing to play.  This game has massive holes in its crafting, plot deployment, and evolution.  It was nice to see some of the game play mechanics from a traditional game like a plot.  However, much like most of the SCG's on the market it lacks a lot of features for the game.  The larger issue I see is that the game doesn't balance crafting materials very well.  Most of the game  I was starving for wood.  While titanium makes life easier it comes in a limited quantity amount.  Islands were good for certain  materials while being on the water was  great for for  plastic, wood and leaves.  Through the game the developer consistently over populated the game while under filling it."
6088,"really didn't expect so much depth and fun from this, was pretty meh solo but if you can find a friend to split ship-running duty with this was a hell of an experience."
6089,game is good
6090,"The birds that drop rocks on your head probably need a tweak. Otherwise, a really good time sink. The music is great and there's something soothing about collecting trash out of the ocean while just sitting on a raft."

6104,"Raft is one of those games that I bought in EA after a friend recommended it and I have had zero regrets.
Now that it's had a full release, I can honestly say I love this game and will be playing it for years to come.
The story they added for the release kept me enthralled. That story kept me looking for every note I could find, to get more of the story.
This might be a controversial opinion, but I genuinely hope they either do a sequel or release DLC that gives us more story.
Seriously: I want to give you more money. Give me a sequel or give me bonus end game quests.
I'm not kidding: I need to know what happened to [spoiler] Astrid, Ruben, and The Grabber. [/spoiler]
Even Better: Give us more back-story on all the playable characters!"
6105,"A wonderful resource management, outward expansion game. With friends its made much better.. but beware if you have Thalassaphobia"
6106,"Gather resources, expand your raft, learn new technologies and enjoy a great story line!
I would recommend you take your time, relax and have fun with your friends."
6107,cool
6108,man just fisherman
6109,It's like Minecraft but nautical and with better graphics
6110,Gotta play
6111,"I like three things about this game:
- Big shark.
- Big raft.
- Big men."
6112,"fun fun
"
6113,"Look. Let's talk brass tacks. What do you buy Raft for? Is it to survive on a raft? Yes. Is it to play a survival game? Yes. Do you expect some nautical themes, maybe sailing, maybe some boat stuff? Yes. Sadly, Raft only delivers on two out of those four. Crucially for me, Raft has an issue where the sailing feels very simple (the wind never changes, so no reason to even move the sail much), and it places a massive emphasis on gameplay elements that are frankly bad, mainly the combat. The combat in this game is extremely basic involves hitting with left mouse key, and jumping around the enemy to confuse the AI. That's it, from the beginning to the end. Unfortunately, there are way too many instances in this game that requires combat, including the ending of the game, which is to the detriment of the entire experience. It is also a real shame that sailing doesn't require much skill or effort."
6114,Why cant i repair my fishing pole
6115,this game is great with friends
6116,"its crazy how this game is only 2 gigs! Its absolutely huge and is very pretty. you will be able to run this game on practically any gaming pc, if your on a desktop you might get roughly 30 fps. I would suggest playing this game with friends because it can get very lonley playing this game by yourself."
6117,"The game would be fun if not for the helpless amount of annoying gameplay designs and raft collision glitches.

The Shark never leaves you alone, even when you kill it, another one spawns in less than a minute making gathering underwater resources extremely tedious. This is a bit better if you craft a shark bait, but getting the appropriate fish for it with the fishing rod can either go to ways. You get two of the required fish OR You literally use up your entire fishing rod only to not get any of the fish you need for the recipe.

While on the topic of enemies: Boars are the worst ive ever seen in this game. 
They do a wind-up animation before charging at you, when they stop they have a bit of a cooldown before they charge again... Now wait, you may think that there is nothing wrong here but no, I haven't said the most important part yet.
The Boars cooldown period gets cancelled as soon as you hit it. Making it [b] instantly [/b] go into wind-up, where it follows you like a laser pointer. So going left or right doesnt let you dodge the boar. Making you have to back away as soon as you hit the boar, only to pray to god that you got far enough away so you can dodge his fuckn' overwatch tracer lookin ass dash attack, also did i mention it has almost the same amount of HP as the shark and that getting hit by it makes you get dragged along with it?

The game is such a grind that I don't feel like im progressing at all.

The rate of Food/Water reduction is way too fast meaning you literally have to eat something every 2 seconds with most of the food giving only a tiny bit of a help. Fruit being literally the worst food, since it only removes your thirst and a tiny bit of food. Boiling saltwater and drinking it is way better than planting and harvesting (for example) watermelon.

I've been playing this game for around 5 hours now and I still have not gotten a single better tool. (Only got 1 Metal Bar)

Also the amount of times I've been semi-launched or pushed off my raft when docked by an island is immense.
Everything is fine until the weather becomes a tiny bit worse. And that happens [b] A LOT [/b]

This game would have been fun if not for all this annoying shit. Too bad I can't refund it anymore.


"
6118,"I like it. There are some pain points like enemies constantly respawning( if you dont loot the entire corpse or dont loot it at all it'll take 2x longer to respawn) or sometimes you feel like you don't get enough materials. but upgraded versions of crafting items are very worthwhile and feel rewarding.  I don't understand the plot, but the story gives you some exciting maps to explore and loot. I feel somewhat compelled to replay the game again using the knowledge I gained too."
6119,super fun a little grindy at times but that comes with all survival games. can keep you busy for hours make sure you watch that clock so 3 hours dont go by just like that!

6152,"A really fun game to play with friends - Unfortunately Redbeet have said that this is the final chapter of the game which hints to no more story content, which is a shame considering the potential for it, however the current story content in the game is very high quality and well thought through. Some of the later story content could do with a little more direction and instruction, as when I played through with some friends we struggled to find certain areas, however once found they didn't disappoint as they were high quality and very different from the start of the game. The achievements are reasonable, and definitely are good for those who like achievement hunting, however I feel that some are slightly excessive, such as the kill 50 of something ones, as the only real way to complete them is to reload the save 50 times."
6153,m
6154,"I am a 45 yo father, probably one of the oldest people playing this game. I am a single farther to my Son, who is 14 now. My son got this game for Christmas from his uncle, so we installed it on his computer and he started playing. By the end of the week he had 24 hours on this game. This was horrible for me, as it was already hard for me to find ways to spend time with my son, as he is always out with his friends or just, watching YouTube. So i decided to make a Steam account and get this game to see if I could maybe play alongside him. loaded into the game, made my character and world and started playing but I was stuck on what you where supposed to do. I asked my Son for help and he hosted a game for me to join. loved it as it was the best time had spent with my Son since my wife had died. This game has ever since brought me and my son closer again and now we actually spend time together outside the house together as well. This game reminded me that there's fun to be had in everything, and it has brought both me and my Son many happy memories."

My recommendation for new players is to get a cup a fishing rod with the pureifier and grille so you don't starve to death like I did when i first started.
I hope you find this helpful and have a good rest or end of day."

6176,Loving this game so far. Especially playing with friends:)
6177,"It is so worth what it costs! It may be bumby in the start but the farther you get in, the more addicting this game is. I am Tangoroa at the time i am writing this, and i can say the story is so immersive. They added a great story, to an incredible sandbox. Way to go Redbeet!"
6178,Raft is the perfect survival game in terms of time invested. It is simple enough that is relaxing and stress free but it complex enough to keep you playing. The perfect game to pick of for an hour and hours on end. Amazing game!
6179,"Great game would highly recommend, super smooth running and light on the server hosting load. brilliant updates since initial early access release. Lovely aesthetic and so many decoration opportunities.

Great story progression, narrative driven through small fully voiced notes that the player must discover on each story island to learn the story of the people who came before the player. overall great variety in story puzzles and locales. Beautiful nautical vistas await.

Fun solo or with friends I'd highly recommend Raft to any adventure lovers."
6180,Great game just watch out for Bruce and you'll be fine

6197,I've been living on a raft for the past weeks and I love it.
6198,"What lasts long will be good.

The good old Raft has finally come to an end and what an end.

The game really caused surprises towards the end with its puzzles and fights - especially if you take a good look at the first chapters that have appeared over the years.

In short: all in all a very good game - especially with friends."

6221,we can build anything.
6222,The Survival Progression of Raft is very fleshed out and is really good. The Smaller islands feel like rewards whenever finding them even in the late game. When Finding the man story islands you feel so good exploring them. they are very detailed and huge. The voice acting along with the lore is definitly something to praise.
6223,good
6224,it good
6225,"With random generation, and without a good soundtrack, story or world-building the game relies upon the raft building to keep things interesting; which it doesn't do very well. Additionally, there are too many annoying mechanics (seagull, shark, tool degradation) which makes the game annoying. I would liked to have spent more time with the game but I can't bring myself to continue playing it because it is too boring."
6226,"Its enjoyable right up until the final chapter, they got very very very lazy, needed to end it with a really fun addition, but this was a joke. Jumping puzzles with knockoff mechanics that cost you so much gameplay. You just want to delete the game in the final chapter, its so sad.    Did you spend all the money you earned between this and last chapter? nothing left for the finale?  Lazy lazy lazy lazy devs.

You can beat the final chapter in probably 20min or less, however the only thing that can slow you down are a myriad of same ol puzzles rehashed.  and a boss thats purely frustration.    But in reality once its done and you realized it was likely 20min of content had you not fallen so many times.   

Game had promise,  Devs got paid and said #%%@ it."
6227,"Love the game, excellent multiplayer, and some of the puzzles can be quite challenging. We are really enjoying it."

It's super fun and a tad bit like subnautica. The only complaint I have is that the armour sets, fins, and oxygen tanks last for way too little time, and expanding your raft can be very annoying, however other then that its a great game."

6260,"Frustrating at times, and one of those ""just look at the wiki after a while"" survival games (if a material seems missing for way way too long, you can probably get it right now, and the game will not really play properly if you can never figure it out... so just look it up).

Despite those issues, it's a pretty chill way to pass the time with an audio program. From cooking stations to agriculture to smelting to fishing, various things require your attention so that after you get started there will always be 2+ useful things waiting on your interaction in order to make further progress, which allows freedom to choose priorities depending on your mood and needs.

The construction system is annoyingly primitive (don't expect a Valheim) but if you're creative enough you can still find small ways to give your raft a unique architecture. Unfortunately the weirder you go the more confused the seagull/shark AI gets, but it's not much of an issue."
6261,love it
6262,k
6263,asd
6264,good game fra
6265,"Very good game the survival and building elements are extremely well designed and enjoyable the story locations are well designed if at times confusing, the content after you start the game but before you actually start the story content is somewhat grindy on your first playthrough. the shark is a fun concept and very well handled, the controls and physics of the game are very impressive and well made, the farming is a nice part of designing your raft, the items and furniture are well designed and very easy to fit into your build, and the price tag on this game is an absolute steal"
6266,"Earlygame food and water management can be a little difficult, but it picks up pretty quick when you get the better purifier and grill. This is a great game to relax to, and would be excellent on its own even before including the story. Its worth the pricetag, and a nobrainer on sale."
6267,:-)
6268,This game is most worth 20$ It's a fun multiplayer/singleplayer game I have not gotten to the main story yet but I still think you should buy it.
6269,good
6270,good
6271,"I bought this game when it first hit early access and thought it would be a great game if it ironed out the grind and fixed the bugs. Sadly with 1.0 nothing really feels new or fixed.

The game really feels like its tailored to a multiplayer/co-op experience so if you plan on playing solo, prepare for an excessive amount of grinding, especially early game. Getting even basic equipment upgrades is almost a nightmare due to how hard it can be to find, especially when you have to deal with enemies, hunger and thirst chipping away at your resources at a constant rate. The degradation system means that a lot of your equipment barely lasts and requires going through the tedious steps just to replace vital equipment.

Another problem is a lot of stuff never really got fixed from early access. If you lose your boat, you can't build a new one and you're basically screwed. The amount of grinding just to get started is just absurd. Even to get basic crafting components to combat the Shark attacks feels ludicrous. This are just a few examples of the numerous unfixed problems that never got fixed.

The hard mode in this game honestly feels like a mistake. While the increased challenge is welcomed, the ""No-Respawn"" thing really feels like overkill. The game says that you can be revived by friends but if your solo, you will be relying on asking someone online to help, which in my opinion just feels like the game trying to force multiplayer on solo players. On top of that you can't even revert to an older save since the game marks your player for death. Save file editing seems to work to fix this but is still a really questionable design decision. This especially frustrating when your character dies to a bug. 

Overall, While a very interesting concept for a survival game, it does nothing new with the genre and falls into the many pitfalls that other survival games fell into. I'm sure many can extract hours of fun with friends but solo just felt like an absolute chore.

6281,"TLDR; I thought the game was really good and the story-telling mechanic was inspired and captivating, but unfortunately I found the ending disappointing.  If you can look past that, I still think this game is worth playing (if you have the time, since it does take a while).

Likes
- The way the narrative is laid out through note-finding I thought was incredibly creative, captivating, and immersive.  It kept me on the hook till the end.  There was a lot of ambiguity and questions I had throughout the game that kept it interesting for me.
- Pretty much every story location, spotting it at first on the horizon, was breathtaking and surprising.

Dislikes
- The most disappointing part, I thought, was the way the ending was very flat and abrupt.  The game content falls off a cliff - there are no side-quests or [spoiler] meaningful interactions you can have with the NPCs.  While most of the game is played eerily alone, I think the ending is when I truly felt lonely. [/spoiler].  Also a few questions are left unanswered or entirely unexplored, and while it kept me captivated throughout the narrative, in the end it just made the game feel incomplete.  Even despite the achievement telling me that was the end of the game, I kept looking for more.  I guess this leaves room for DLC, but I think it would be better story design to have a more satisfying ending.
- I was also disappointed that even in the end of the game, your character does not get to make any meaningful choices with respect to the story.  [spoiler] I would have also appreciated it if your character's personal decisions had made any influence on the ending -- things like how many notes you found and how well you put the story together, or other things like the fact that I collected 2 of every animal and had a nice bee/farm ecosystem going.  To be honest, I thought a cool ending would be that Utopia is empty like every other place, and you go back home to your family/people to report your forward scout findings, give advice on where to settle and what issues different locations have, and impress your people and boost their society with your nice collection of animals, bees, and technology.  Instead, the entire notion of your family or where you are from or even what you were actually supposed to accomplish as forward scout is basically completely unmentioned.  [/spoiler]
- [spoiler] I really wanted to kill Olof, but the game didn't let me! Gah! [/spoiler]
- I did take my time, but the game is a little slow/tedious
- You unlock a bunch of cool tech at the end, which a part of me really wants to utilize, but there is just no content left in the game so it feels kind of pointless to do so.  I wish there was more!

This is a pretty complainy review, but... MAKE MORE GAME!"
6282,"Overall fun game. I like the creative mode to just build fun rafts, but the adventure mode is pretty neat, too."
6283,This is a very cool game. I recommend to play with friends because it makes the experience so much more fun. When you get far enough into the game that's where it becomes interesting. It make your imagination go wild since there are no boundaries too what type of raft you want to build.
6284,"Game turns into a fricking parkour jump puzzle in the later islands... avoid if you don't like that. Besides, not much crafting anyway."
6285,So good! I love it! Cheap and fun!
6286,Bro this game is insanely fun with friends man
6287,Great cool game

6290,Good Game

6292,"Great game, hope there is a dlc in progress :-)"
6293,"Some mechanics are annoying to work with but overall, the game is fun and well worth the asking price."
6294,yeee
6295,"Solid fun gameplay and can be very challenging if you up the difficulty (more players does not = making it easier as food and water is limited).

Towards the end of the game there is less survivalism and more puzzling things out. End game gets a bit platformy and the combat is kinda janky but the story and setting is very interesting and the particular survival setting of the game is very fun and unique."
6296,A decent slow burn kind of survival game. The crafting is definitely satisfying and I often get caught up on trying to make my raft look good and then die of thirst. It's always got something to keep you on your toes. If you like surviving and building things then this just might be up your street.
6297,"Lost interest at the 2nd chapter, I don't like puzzles."

6299,Good game.
6300,chewbaccas left testy.
6301,Not sure if I ate more sharks than ate me...
6302,raft is a buetifull ochen based game and the main goal is to survive. but raft is more then that you can design  yore own raft and paint it. and you have a wide varity of bulding opchiens. and if yore bored you can try and get all the achviments. but overall its an amazing game
6303,"Raft is simply one of the most charming survival games I’ve played. Simply standing on my raft as it floats over the waves through an endless body of water is truly relaxing. There’s also a great sense of pride and achievement that comes with seeing what I’ve built every time I load into the game. It’s an easy recommendation for survival fans that may have been holding off on jumping into early access, as well as those just learning about the game for the first time."

6322,"all good until some of the new content, the new island is also pretty good until one part, a jump puzzle. this game is not a jump puzzle game and this feels completely out of place in the game, and in the story.Why would they have walkways that lead to spinning fans that knock you off the platforms? it makes zero sense. So for that alone im not recommending the game, so disappointed"

6330,"Raft is my favorite game in my library and it really is a great game filled with lots of amazing lore and story lines that make the game super immersive. There are a few cons amidst the sea of pros though.

Pros
-Lore is amazing
-Story islands very intricate and difficult to pass
-Great building system
-Progression is great
-Lots of creativity involved
-Not very demanding

Cons 
-Couple bugs that disrupt the playing experience 
-Graphics are ok but surely not great

6340,"This was such a fun promising thing at the start, and building a raft is pretty fun. 
It started out as a survival game, that both my wife and I loved, 
Now I am writing this review, as I am waiting for her to platform a super annoying part, with dreadful inaccurate mechanics. 
The last few islands don't have the survivor feel anymore. It feels like the devs crammed all the puzzles and useless time wasters to pad the game time. And the final boss and the story is just garbage.
Instead of telling passive stories of the dead and gone world, the game tries to narrate it to you at every possible corner. And it fails miserably. 
It mostly tells instead of shows, and the whole world feels empty and lifeless. 
The diving mechanics are left as an afterthought, in a world that is 99% water. It consists of diving a bit around the islands and hitting stuff with your hook. A missed opportunity to tell a story of cities drowned, and hardships that come with a global flood. 

No upgrades are later needed to use in the game, as you can beat the entirety of the game in less than 10h, even if you take it slow, and build up your raft to max upgrades. (We played every update and I managed to squeeze 50h out of it, as we were restarting every time full of hope to see new things) 

It feels like a very junior Dev teams work. 

The game has forgotten what it started out as,

I would not recommend
I wish I wasn't annoyed by this game

6359,"A fun survival game that takes a surprising turn once you get to the story part of the game. My hours consist of multiple playthroughs while the game was still in early access but I believe my full run through the game was at about 20 hours playing it co-op. At full price I felt as though I got my money's worth.

The gathering and exploration is fun, and there is a surprisingly amount of materials to brighten up your raft if you're into more of the decoration aspect of the game. You can paint things on your raft. You can collect cosmetic items like plants, paintings and signage. You can even use items to give your raft a more boat like appearance if you're into that sort of thing.

My biggest gripe about the game is the pacing of the equipment that you get. While the first half or so of the game is a slow crawl to get a raft to sustain yourself on, the second half is an exponential curve of materials and recipes thrown at you. In fact, you get so many cool things in the final hours of the game that you don't even get to enjoy them. I didn't even get the chance to build all the cool electrical supplies. What is the point of getting the most powerful weapon in the game once the story is over?

Did I have a fun time playing this game? Absolutely. Would I recommend picking up this game? Without a doubt. It is not without flaws, but overall I think this is a fun game to play with friends.

8.0/10.0"

its unity  clunk is tolerable than its just plain annoying 
enjoyed making a raft and doing a few island story bits
after that  its just repetitive puzzles 
good with friends boring solo 
"
6393,Trash... absolute trash. Let me explain. Lets say you are playing solo the reason doesn't matter maybe none of your friends have the game maybe they don't wanna play with you. Maybe you have no friends. Anyways doesn't matter what matters is you are solo. So say you are exploring and you fall and die. The game will INSTANTLY save not letting you go to ANY past saves and since you're solo you LOSE 2/3 of the stuff in your inventory. Why? It seems to me that Redbeet interactives that you NEED other people to play with and to enjoy the game? So what just because my friends don't have a computer I can't enjoy a you're game? well sorry to say but you just lost someone who used to like you're game. DON'T INSTALL
6394,"I am a 38 yo father, probably one of the oldest people playing this game. I am a single farther to my Son, who is 9 now. My son got this game for Christmas in 2021 from his uncle, so we installed it on his computer and he started playing. By the end of the week he had 24 hours on this game. This was horrible for me, as it was already hard for me to find ways to spend time with my son, as he is always out with his friends or just watching YouTube. So I decided to make a Steam account and get this game to see if I could maybe play alongside him. I loaded into the game, picked my character and world and started playing but I was stuck on what you where supposed to do. I asked my Son for help and he hosted a game for me to join. I loved it as it was the best time I had spent with my Son since my wife had died. This game has ever since brought me and my son closer again and now we actually spend time together outside the house together as well. This game reminded me that there's fun to be had in everything, and it has brought both me and my Son many happy memories."

6398,"Game is super fun! Especially with friends. 

"
6399,"Strangest design choice

After I started my game and looted some mats, a shark attacked by raft. I grabbed some more mats and saw a small island. Since the shark already plugged 1 piece out of my raft, I made for the island. Then I wanted to build a raft. I created a hammer from my mats but found no way to build a raft.

I had to search for reasons in the Steam forum and found that loosing the initial 2x2 raft screws you over permanently.

While I can see few argument in favor of this design choice, IMO it makes absolutely no sense to not be able to build a new raft from scratch. The one I lost was already gone so I wasnt able to return to it. With no way to anchor the raft at the initial island, from a perspective if in real-life one was stranded on a 2x2 raft, every single person would go for the island and use his bare hands to anchor and pull the mini raft to this island.

There should be either an option to anchor the initial 2x2 raft to the first island, an option to abandon the current raft and build a new one from scratch, or there should be a way to return to the raft or respawn it at your current position. Since none of these are true, because of such a strange design choice, I cannot recommend the game."

6404,"good game, oh sorry w game"
6405,"Overall rating 8/10. It's wonderful on peaceful if you just want to chug along and build and craft things with minimal to no challenge. The different levels (I've only played peaceful/easy) allow for variations of challenge with the creatures of this game and how often you need to repair or replace damaged goods. The graphics are cute and the overall mechanics aren't too difficult to maneuver. Definitely a good range from a ""cozy"" game to a challenging survival based on your preference. Currently no negatives."
6406,It's really fun
6407,It is a lot of fun and a slightly different take on the survival/builder genre.  Definitely need to go in with a plan though and a friend or two if you want to be action efficient.  My only complaint is that I sometimes get a frame rate drop when the game auto saves the world. Well worth the purchase overall  though.

6437,"I'm still playing this game, oh my god, why am I still playing this game. I have dishes to do, put the game down. TAT;;; 
It's a really good game. It's relaxing if you want it to be, it's engaging if you don't. There's a lot to do, and the pacing is undeniably perfect. You have plenty of time to gas up your raft (so to speak) before the next locale, or you can gun it within ten minutes or so. 
I haven't found any glitches or ticks aside trash, sand and whatever being too close to the shoreline, and being unable to harvest it because I'm not technically underwater. But that's like.. not even an issue. lol That's what this game is - there's an issue and it's not an issue. XD I can't find anything else. 

I would say up the music tracks a bit more though. They get repetitive real fast because they're so limited. You should at least have two hours worth of music track in your game, if I were to say. 

What I like most about this game is you can turn the waves off. They call it motion sickness off/on, and I love it, because my motion sickness is *bad* some days. It just comes and goes as a natural disorder. (get it? Natural disorder?) So having that is really nice. 

I'm sad to see the game end though. I finished this along the same time as PowerWash Simulator, and now I'm sad because I have to throw myself into a new game. lol This one has some crazy replayability though. Definately worth the money, on sale or not."
6438,"6/10 DO NOT PLAY SINGLEPLAYER
this game is not for people with no friends because if you die you lose a certain percentage of your inventory but this percentage isn't right because it removes stacks and stuff it probably shouldn't multiplayer you can revive other players and it completly rules this out"

6447,"To summarize this game without spoilers; The world had been flooded. Who knows who has survived the flood but youre on a journey to stay alive and see if there is life out there. The ocean is flooded with garbage and all you can use is the garbage around you, and whatever is on what were once mountain-tops that you now see as islands. Do your best to build with what you have found and continue your journey along the sea to find whatever awaits you ahead in the ocean.


In my opinion, 10/10 game. Everything about this game is very well made, thought out, and designed. Not just mechanically and physically, but also graphically. Not a super high end game that makes your pc scream yet the graphics are really quite impressive, even on low settings. Im not an expert on this but I think someone who is new to survival games would still find this easy and enjoyable. 

(Ratings below may spoil the game a little so caution on that)

Overall; Game mechanics: 9.8/10 | Graphic design: 9.8/10 | Story Plot: 9.5/10 | Objectives & Landmarks/POI's: 11/10 | Music: 13/10 | Items: 10/10 | Difficulty: 2/10 (which is actually good in this case) | Character Design: 3.5/10 | Ending: ?/10 - Find out :>"

6468,"Game is amazing, but it's certainly a game I believe should be played with friends.

The art style? Awesome.
Story? Great but slow to take off.
The music? Christ I wish they would play more of it because it's SO good when it does play.

There's a good chunk of creative freedom in both the functionality of your raft as well as the aesthetic. The decorations are so good and funny, and putting together a raft that's fully furnished is hella satisfying.

Unless you're playing in easy mode, you are constantly waging war with not only you resident SHARK, but aggressively worrying about your food and water. Like all the time. For real. If you like survival games this will certainly be right up your ally, and if you like creating luxury cruise liners, I mean...you can probably get there lol."

6479,"This game is not a good game by any means. It's buggy as all hell, enemy diversity is thin, and up until you actually start the story it's a complete and utter grindfest. But I can't say I hate the game in the slightest. I love making rafts that look cool, I love getting into automation, I love the calm, waveless nights with marine life passing under the raft, and I love discovering all the cool remains of a long-forgotten civilization. Given the budget this game deserves I could imagine this game becoming one of my favorite games of all time, because the concept and gameplay are such a strong and winning formula. But as it stands? I'd say it's still worth a playthrough. Great at scratching that Wind Waker nostalgia and a blast with friends. Only issues I have are the early parts of the gameplay loop can get stale, AND THAT GODDAMN SHARK. 8/10."

6482,"Good game to play with your friends. Solid progression system and combat gameplay. Game has good lore that you can easily gloss over and ignore. 
My only gripe with this game is having to constantly drink/eat to survive. 
Finally, there are also mods you can install to enhance your experience."
6483,great with friends!
6484,good game
6485,yes
6486,the game can start off a bit slow but gets interesting fast
6487,"Requires friends.

If you don't have friends then good luck to you and if you are the person to rush games then the game isn't for you.
But hey, if you got those objects called friends then it's actually a pretty cool game.
The survival aspect of the game is done quite well but the story/puzzle aspect could do a little work at times as it can get extremely annoying to figure out on your own in some areas. Also it's not exactly the most interesting, but I think it is fun to learn the tech tree and overall progression in your Raft to make it extremely efficient.
Did I say it requires friends?
They also have to be smart friends too."
6488,good
6489,Bruce is a cool dude
6490,just shit

6492,"The Game Story line is good and the Puzzle can be fun to do too as long you have the patience for it.

Things i DON'T LIKE.

1# Shark Spawn On top of u when you are in the Water harvesting.
2# Hit Box On ""All Birds"" are Exstremely Small. - Seagull is the Worse when you try to protect your Crops.
3# Chicken Lays Eggs faster then the Grass can regrow ""chickens can die from hunger if not Looking after"""

6505,"I almost never buy games in early access—not because I’m opposed to it on principle, but because with a massive backlog of finished games, it makes little sense to me to put them aside to play an unfinished one. I’m in no hurry, and am happy to wait for full release.

But despite the enormous popularity of the survival game genre, there are almost no good, chill co-op ones. Those that exist tend to involve fighting hostile players or zombies. I needed a game to play with some friends who were combat-averse, and Raft was already many years into release, so we picked it up.

I’m quite happy with it, but what you get out Raft will depend pretty much entirely on two things: how much you enjoy the core loop, and how much you’re interested in a slow-paced, relaxing game vs. one with lots to do, or an exciting narrative.

The core loop of raft, built off of a successful game jam entry, is simple and wonderful: you’re adrift on a seemingly endless ocean, broken only by the occasional small island. You’re able to fashion a grappling hook, and can use it to catch drifting debris: palm leaves, wood, plastic. From these, you can expand your raft, both in the sense of making it physically larger, and in the sense of adding everything from water purifiers, to cooking stations, to beds, to various cosmetic niceties.

In this sense, it’s a fairly typical survival game; the big difference is that your base is mobile, you’re restricted to pretty low-tech stuff, and there’s a shark that regularly attacks your base. The shark adds some tension, but pretty quickly becomes more of a background annoyance than a true threat, particularly if you play on lower difficulties where dying doesn’t result in a loss of inventory (as we did).

I personally love the grappling mechanic and the varied pacing, where you switch between hanging out on your raft and stopping off at islands to explore and gather materials. There’s a good 20-30 hours of gameplay in this core loop, though eventually you’ll have found almost all there is to be found; there is definitely a finite number of objects and mechanics in this game, and despite achieving financial success the developers have opted to keep their team small, so progress towards 1.0 is quite slow (though steady), and certain elements are pretty threadbare (the combat system is barely-there, the Rocs that drops rocks (really) on you are borderline-invicible and not even worth trying to fight).

There’s also a narrative mode, where you follow radio signals to unique environments; exploring these grants you unique technology as well as the unfolding story of how the Earth got flooded, and what happened to the survivors. The environments are fun to explore and significantly different from the procedurally generated islands. The story is, frankly, pretty bad: cliched, artlessly written, too full of characters that barely exist. But it’s the sort of well-meaning work of enthusiastic amateurs, rather than something phoned in, and so I don’t bear it any ill will, and I understand it's been improved in the most recent update (which I haven't had the time to dig into yet).

Raft is a simple game, and I can imagine various ways it would be more fleshed out, but on its own terms it’s a lovely time and well worth the low asking price."
6506,ye
6507,"The ending a little bit underwhelming tbh. They had a whole story lined up and I was kinda expecting something less predictable. The story was pretty cool though, so I geuss it gets a pass? The gameplay loop was fun too and overall is was a fun experience. Every new story island never failed to improve on what they had done on the previous one."
6508,The game has given me many great hours of fun with my dad.
6509,Progression is frustrating and takes way too long. Not very adequate.
6510,"I'm really enjoying this game so far! Have progressed through a good chunk of the story and am interested in learning more about the world and characters. I like that you can unlock additional characters to play by exploring the story locations. Also, if you are playing solo, I suggest playing on Easy, as you won't keep losing all your inventory upon dying (which happened to me frequently in Normal, as I didn't have anyone who could rez me). 

I do like the crafting and designing my raft, but wish there was a way to craft using items in my storage containers...I don't have my stuff super organized so I end up having to check pretty much all the containers to find the stuff I need for crafting, when it would be a huge quality of life thing to just have items in storage count as ""in inventory"". 

Overall, I love this game and can see myself playing through it again with friends when I get the chance!"
6511,good game is funny with friendds

6535,"Raft is a great survival/crafting/puzzle game that you can sink hours into, it does pass my base requirements for what i would call a good game which is getting at least 1 hour of playtime out of every dollar spent

[h1] Gameplay [/h1]

[b] 8/10 [/b]
While it can be quite tedious/repetitive at times in single player it's still enjoyable for the most part and quite easy to understand, where it really shines is in multiplayer with close friends. the puzzle aspect of the game comes into play during the story, although calling it puzzle may be a stretch since it mostly consists finding key items and the occasional code to decipher. the puzzles can be a little confusing at times but all of them can be done without looking at walkthroughs.

[h1] Story [/h1]

[b] 6/10 [/b]
Although i believe that the story has change since i first started playing it was originally something that could be largely overlooked aside from codes needed. With that being the case you could still follow the story quite easily with most notes being easily found.

[h1] Ending [/h1]

[b] 4/10 [/b]
It's not a bad ending per se, but it was certainly a letdown after the rest of the game. The parts that really brought the quality of the ending down was the cheap boss fights and lacklustre rewards([spoiler] just being better durability tools and cosmetics/decorations[/spoiler]. I would say that they fell into the trap that many early access games fall into which is the pressure to rush to an end product while also losing the main idea of the game in favor of what they think the community wants, at the very least, the ending doesn't really take away the enjoyment of the main gameplay

[h1] Overall [/h1]

[b] 8/10 [/b]
As stated earlier while the ending was less than I desired, it doesn't bring the rest of the game down. It was still very enjoyable for me and i look forward to starting a new save to experience the new story despite the ending."
6536,"I'm not a fan of the start of this game, it's slow and the food/hydration system really feels like a chore but after you get established it's pretty fun!   So for those of you who are struggling at the start just know it gets better."

6547,very good
6548,Great survival building game with a decent story. Food and drink consumption is pretty insane but it gets better later on in the game. Well worth the money!
6549,"Great survival game, especially with some friends. Story is good. Only down side is you need to eat and drink 10 cars worth of food every 10 minutes, but by end game it's not an issue."
6550,the shark bites
6551,"Bought this game just yesterday, and I've already clocked in about 12 hours. Dangerously addictive if you enjoy decorating and survival game elements. I would say that the experience playing solo vs playing with friends is vastly different, and they're both respectively enjoyable. Not sure if there's an octopus in the game yet, but if there is one, I'm going to be one happy sailor. (h e l l yeah we love octopus in this house) I give this a solid 8/10 experience."
6552,great game and is a  lot of fun when you are playing with your friends
6553,"I haven't finished it yet (my time is split between multiple saves), but it's a game I find myself just sinking hours at a time into. It's quite fun and satisfying to survive off of a raft you built and debris in the ocean. The story side of things is delivered through Subnautica-esque finding story locations to explore and listening to voice logs left behind in these locations. It doesn't pull it off as well as the aforementioned game imho (no shade, it's a high bar) but what I've gotten of the story itself so far is quite interesting and I'm eager to see where it goes.

My biggest complaint is the sheer amount of micromanaging. You have to keep your hunger and thirst covered, your crops watered and growing, your metal smelting, your nets clear, your raft navigating to or around islands, your tiny inventory and storage containers sorted, etc almost constantly. Every tool has durability and wears out fast. If you play on anything other than peaceful, you have to keep the shark from destroying your raft and the seagulls from eating your crops (put them in a closed room), and try not to be gored by warthogs when exploring large islands (easy once you get the hang of it--until then, very frustrating). I wanted to play a harder difficulty but stuck to easy just because I didn't want to have to do extra managing to keep my hunger and thirst up later in the game.
It hasn't turned me away from playing--obviously, 60 hours--or recommending the game as a whole, but it can get tiring and may turn others away, so fair warning. 

It's really fun to play with friends. My favorite aspect of the game is probably the designing and building the raft itself, thankfully the game has a creative mode just for that. It has a nice visual style and is quite pretty, even with how limited my graphics are I find myself staring at the moon and the light it casts on the water as it rises and sets. The soundtrack is likewise very pretty and calming. It's overall nicely atmospheric, especially at night.

So yeah, solid 7-8/10 recommend. Great game to play with the boys but still good in singleplayer.
May update when I'm further along and/or have finished the story."
6554,The game is so cool has allot of things that exist in life not like other games I have really enjoyed playing it!
6555,"Man this game was SO good the first 80%. Then you get the last two islands. With tedious (not clever, tedious) puzzles and a ""boss"" that is insanely frustrating with endless spawns. Really awful mechanics in the last 20% of the game. Which is unfortunate."
6556,"It was very enjoyable. Only thing missing for me was, after ""completing"" the game, I felt no incentive to keep playing. Feels like an end game is missing."
6557,"Really fun co-op; if you have a steam buddy to go adventure with, it is a gem. Solo is also fun. But multiplayer needs a bit  improvements (regarding network). Overall, a gem."
6558,"I used to love this game, I even tried to like it after the final update, but it's so far removed from what it used to be that it's become a Frankenstein's monster of poor writing and bad decisions held together by duct tape and vine goo.
The base building side of this game is great. Fending off Bruce, fishing, looting islands (I even forgive the cut and paste terrain), searching the oceans etc is fun and multiplayer makes it even better.
But then came the jumping puzzles and more jumping puzzles and janky plot. This final chapter is a parkour nightmare. Some jumping puzzles I get, sure, but at this point it's filler to make the game longer with as little effort as possible.
It's lazy writing; the equivalent of killing the dog off in a horror film. This game has such a devoted fan base that this kind of poor development is a bit of a kick in the pants. 
To add insult to injury there's no working save function. The save world function does indeed save the world, but not your player status so it's possible to reload your latest save and be incapacitated on the floor."
6559,good game fun
6560,Amazing game. Had so much fun with friends and the story is pretty cool too though I wish there was more to the story added after what was delivered at the end. Overall its still a very fun game to play.

6576,I loved this game since i was kid. It's fun survival game. The shark is pretty annoying but it's fells good when you get rid of him. I can play this for hours if i'll have enough time. this my Top 5 favorite survival game.
6577,"The most frustrating part about Raft is the colossal amount of wasted potential it has

Chapter 1 is absolutely fantastic, there's so much to explore and learn and progress comes in a nice comfortable pace. Unfortunately, that is due to the fact that chapter 1 hosts 80% of the game's content
After one specific point of the game, early within chapter 2, the game grinds to a jarring halt. There is still some progress to be made, but all of that progress is locked behind parkour challenges and/or puzzles in premade linear story islands that the game points you towards.

There are different biomes for the random islands you come across, but they do not have any new resources you couldn't have acquired before (in fact, all the different biomes provide LESS content than the starting one, in every way)
It is really obvious that the development team chose to focus all their time into making huge premade levels for the player to explore, at the cost of all the exploration and progress that were presented as the main focus of the game on early stages of development

I can't recommend this, not right now. It's way too frustrating seeing such a strong start just being squandered like this
Also, you can make a plastic cup and reuse that to drink water throughout the entire game. But the moment you craft a glass to hold some juice in, you wasted it and have to make a new one for every drink you wanna have. Y'all can go fuck yourselves"
6578,game very epic with frien
6579,"pro streamer review time.
In all honesty 
i would totally recommend this game because its fun.( mostly peaceful and creative)

how ever i can't honestly recommend a game that 
1: is super harsh even on easy with a shark attacking you and your raft every 2 seconds.
when you want to play the actual game.
2: doesn't have easily accessible developer menu with user friendly interface.
( so you don't have to install a mod to access it)
(Raft has one because people found it for the game code and made an unofficial patch for it)
raft developer menu doesn't actually have anything that a player could break the game with.

A lot of people love playing in developer modes
(aka create your own style of game play using game functions and features)
( i checked all the survival games on my list they all have 1) 

3.  with controller system that constantly breaks.
half the time it wont let me control map or use controller.
i use controller and keyboard when necessary.

almost every time i play raft the controller won't work or the keyboard wont work.
I have to do 3 steps to get it to work for like 2 seconds. including force closing the game."
6580,This game is a super fun crafting/survival game. I found it to be most fun when playing with friends.
6581,The shark is like a ass also the game plays like gta
6582,Bruce go brrr
6583,Really fun and not that laggy.
6584,"It's fun! Don't sink as much time into as I did. The final act is lacking, I would have preferred the raft to be more relevant than it was. There is a good amount of bugs and jank even out of early access, but nothing game breaking. It's worth it for $20"

6593,Previously on Raft...
6594,"If you're not good at platforming games, this game billed as survival crafting is not for you.

I adored the first chapters. I had a solo raft on Peaceful mode and a couple of different normal-mode rafts that I co-oped with friends. We had a blast. Granted, combat is janky as heck. But building is fun, exploring is fun, four of the five original story locations were fun (Balboa is a nightmare no matter how familiar you manage to get with the layout of the location). The bits of lore were interesting and believable, like an anthology of human experiences of this disaster that ended human civilization.

Before the full release, I'd have recommended Raft without reservation. Unfortunately, the past few hours of gameplay have been disappointing. The revamped ""storyline"" takes the lore out of the realm of disparate but poignant human experiences and straight into cliched end-of-the-world movie nonsense. After all, why make the villain of the piece something relevant like loneliness or shortsightedness or an obsession with status, when you can just have one guy be both The Mad Scientist and The Demagogue and make him drive the whole plot?

I've enjoyed aspects such as the added playable characters and raft equipment. The trade post is a nice idea, though the concept of using a form of money instead of a pure barter system feels silly. Mechanics such as getting buffs from food and drink similarly feel out of place. Varuna Point, the story location after Tangaroa which I waited for with much excitement, is unplayable if you aren't good at tricky platformers with clunky controls. I haven't gotten any further yet. Maybe Varuna Point is just a weak spot. If so, I'll edit this review."

There are still a fair amount of bugs in the game which is another thing but most of them have been patched at this point.

The game could still use some more Endgame content, some more updates not to the story but just over all quality of life and polishing the game, they labeled the latest update the ""Final Update"" but I do hope that they continue to update with more content among the bug fixes they will continue doing as they said."

6634,"Since I bought this game I've been pretty much playing it in all of my free time. It's a relatively fun game, not too complicated and easy to get sucked into. There seems to be a nice balance between traversing the islands as you mosey along and actively seeking to progress in the story. I'm 69 hrs in and only just now finished Balboa Island for the first time, but I'm also a sucker for any kind of base construction games and have been sucked into that lol.

I do wish that there were a few more variations of the larger islands you can explore. 

More importantly, though, it would be awesome to see more decorative items in the game. It would be neat to be able to add glass to windows (or whole glass walls!), palm floors, wooden grates as floor/ceiling tiles to allow rain to soak tiles below, more variation in furniture options, or even just being able to find decoration recipes for furniture you find at different story locations. I'd like to have some incentive to keep building up my raft after I have the bones of it looking how I want it to. Ultimately, that's what the appeal of the game is for me, not the story itself. And there are only so many hibiscus plants I can place before it feels a bit redundant, lol"

6680,i keep disconnecting and have to alt+f4. fix this shit betches
6681,"It's been a treat to watch this game grow and change, having played it since it first came out I'm thoroughly impressed with the story that's come from the creators, and ultimately a very relaxing game. (aside from shark ptsd)"
6682,one of the best games i have ever played in my life
6683,good game to play with friends
6684,Ruft
6685,"THIS IS SO FUN U HAVE TO PLAY IT
"
6686,Good Game but still needs some work
6687,Great game for multiplayer
6688,"I've sunk quite a few hours (155+ hours at the time of writing this) into this game. As a big fan of survival-crafting games, this one stands out. It's relatively simple (for good or ill), with a simple premise, simple threats, and simple needs.
Even before the newest update (version 1.0), your constant companion the shark (ol' Bruce) was a relatively level threat: not too great, but not too shallow either. The large Screechers are more annoying, but easy to avoid with cover, and the boars can be dodged by baiting them to charge in straight lines, or leading them to the coast and stabbing away.
Your resource needs have never changed, your main needs, simple or advanced, usually boil down to the same sorts of resources: wood, plastic, palm fronds/rope, or scrap, with a need for things like seaweed/vine goo and iron/copper ingots later on, but all these things can be collected at each and every island you stop at, in some variable quantity. If you are efficient, you are usually never hurting for resources. If you are not, it isn't usually long before you find what you need. It's a pretty solid system. The game's just a simple fun game. Very chill, relaxing, and extremely fun to play both alone or with friends.

That said, make no mistake, it is still rough around the edges. At the time of writing this review, the game only just came out of Alpha with its Version 1.0, and there's definitely a lot that shows it is still fresh out of there. Rough sea waves have a tendency to clip through the raft, giving the illusion of (and sometimes the audio cue) of sinking and being underwater; Harvestable plants can be harvested through walls if the crop plot is attached to a wall; The Painting system forces you to use a limited set of color patterns that you may not want if you want two tones on tile (I'd love a simple [Panel/Trim] option myself); the list goes on, and that's only a few smaller examples.

But don't let those discourage you. The game is worked on frequently enough, and there's clearly a love for it, both by the developers and the playerbase (myself included). Overall, probably one of the better survival-crafty games I've played in the many years since Minecraft came out that I've been playing games like this. An easy A+ from me."
6689,"YO WTF WHY HAVING I COMMENTED ON THIS ONE
ITS AMAZING
PLAY IT

6697,shark
6698,"Four years ago I picked up raft on whim for like 30$ (AUD) and for 45 hours this game has delivered, even when having nothing to do in the game I just would drift fish and collect materials.
If your going to play this game CO-OP definitely bump the difficulty up a bit if your a veteran of survival games as that aspect of the game is basic (Hunger,Thirst and Health)
The Story sets you on a 2x2 cubed raft to begin and you have to uncover the mystery as to ow you became marooned.

All up Raft is a solid 8/10 
Gameplay - 4/5 (its not overall challenging with a few minor things to be ironed out it sets Raft up to be playable by most ages, I would also recommend the game to play with someone who's not really into gaming
Soundtrack - 3/5 (cuts in, might need patching. Aside from that the music is super chill, except for the boombox you can pick up ;) )
Story - Best not to rush through it i believe as the story is a bit on the short side but that's where the game makes up for it as your raft i don't think is ever truly finished."

6724,"The so called ""NOT recommended"" reviews mostly state that they couldn't play the game because it doesn't explain itself much how to play. Does this even exist in other survival games like Minecraft? They became impatient and didn't try to explore; they didn't read the labels on the recipe book items. IF they did, then they would have liked the game and gone far like me."
6725,"Overall experience is good, I can even say it's lovely.
But the final island, Utopia feel kinda rush. I expected more to be honest"
6726,I like it.
6727,"Raft is what Minecraft wishes it could be. There are constant threats, whether dying of thirst or hunger, running out of supplies, etc. Not to mention this game makes you work for your tools and materials. Solo play is slow but challenging (a good challenging! one of my frustrations with Minecraft is that it's too easy.), even when you play on ""easy mode."" Great game, 8/10."
6728,u need fren to play or else boring
6729,nice game

6733,Nice game
6734,Good
6735,Its a very fun open game about building rafts and exploring islands. And beware for the sharks and other creatures in the sea and land. This is a fun game in the beginning than it falls off after you explore all the story islands. I would rate this game a 8/10
6736,OMG Shark!
6737,"89m ,"
6738,Perfect gamer moment
6739,"Well its more or less a starving simulator, way to simple and boring. the movement is trash, the weather simulations are bad and you can only play in a coop mod. 
Those sharks are just annoying nothing more.
After less then 2 hours i was happy that i was that bored and that i had a massiv uncomfortably feeling while playing this game.
Thats why i was able to give it back.
Best descision i made"

Stop eating our foundations that we are so proud to have been able to build ^^ EVEN tho the final chapter is out, and I haven't played that one yet, BUT I hope it's not the end of the game. :D

If you are trying to find a game for you and your bestfriend or/and your s/o, this is it! Just don't get seasick!
We played it first on easy mode, I found that hard enough, but probably cause I'm such a big dork, so next time we are doing it from scratch and trying out normal. ^^"

1) It's boring as nails.
2) It's brilliant as duck."
6756,gut... mag ich
6757,GOOD
6758,i cant recommend this game enough
6759,"This game is pretty fun, the story keeps you moving from one place to another while unlocking new gear to craft. The only issue I have is that upon completion of the game you unlock titanium tools... what's the purpose there? You're done with the game at that point and replayability is pretty low. Unless you are just roaming around going to the same islands over and over its just dumb to have item tiers locked until after completion.."
6760,"I can not recommend this game. The core gameplay is repetetive and grindy, the art is lackluster at best and the story and voiceacting is horrendous. The way you are forced to progress the story is very ""gamey"" and you don¨t care about the characters or the story they are trying to convey. After getting to the third island me and my buddy quit, after about 17 hours of playtime. Even though its a small indie studio that made this game, I can not recommend it because of the lack of modern features, graphics, yanky combat and overall underwhelming features. I could understand some of the lack of features and finish if it still was in early access, but this game was just fully released - and thats just sloppy work."
6761,"can't thro chicen off clif, bad game."
6762,"This game pre-Final Chapter was phenomenal. It's still fun, but the creative direction they took is a bit questionable. Most of the cons are just Final Chapter updates.

Pros:
- Probably one of the best Survival Craft games out there.
- Extremely fun to just vibe in.
- Survival isn't easy until late game.
- Story is great until near the end.
- Satisfying to build a machine to help you not die for 2 seconds.

Cons:
- The addition of voice lines to the notes is terrible as the voice acting is eh at best, but thankfully you can turn that off.
- The NPCs added are a major blow to the game though, as it was much cooler to be the last survivor that you know of.
- Two of the three islands are kinda fun to explore, but Utopia straight out just sucks. It is just stacking boxes simulator.
- Bruce is no longer a bastard, dunno when or why that was changed.
- There is no endgame after you do Utopia, nor do you [i]actually find your sibling.[/i]
- For the one NPC I bothered to listen to, the talking animation was Bethesda tier.

Basically just turn off voice acting in settings and then have fun until you reach the final island."
6763,"Yes, but...
This is a nice survival game with focus on building. I've played the whole game in co-op and started in early access.
I've always enjoyed this game. It has good controls, nice music and what started as a good story. I do feel the last chapter was rushed and fell a bit flat for me. The game also gets quite a bit repetitive, especially if you want all achievements. 
Its a grindy game, but they've added tons of building options, so you should be entertained if you like this part.
Don't buy this game if you don't like grindy and repetitive gameplay or if you need a really good story to enjoy a game. However, if you're up for some grind and casual co-op, then this might be the one for you.
I would recommenend this one, but only for co-op gameplay. I don't think I would've enjoyed this on my own for this long when having to repeat the same islands over and over again."

6772,fun shit
6773,"This game brings a lot of what a survival gamer could ask lots of ways to achieve your goals and lots of awesome recipes for crafting items, the story once you get too it is also well done this game is 100% worth the purchase."
6774,It's a really good game for playing with friends.
6775,.
6776,"Pirate game :D

Make circuit boards and radios from scratch using  your bare hands, just like the pirates used to!"
6777,Very good.
6778,"The game starts out very fun, and the exploration is great, all the progress feels nice. Unfortunately, as you near the end of the story, Raft brutally goes downhill. The story locations are unfun and tedious, and the final mission feels awful. The majority of the ending consists of stacking f*cking boxes in a room with enemies spawning endlessly. After finishing the game, you unlock the best tools, which is unfortunate timing because there's nothing to do after you finish the story. There is a lot of grind for what seems to be very little reward. If I had known what waited for me nearing the end, I'd probably have dropped the game."
6779,"[h1] I tried to like it [/h1]

I thought after leaving early access I might give it a chance. But it limited everything so hard, my fun limit is reached ...

[u]story[/u]
We played 'til island 3 and the story ist good I guess. Nothing special so far, sometimes you also meet random NPCs who are super useless to the story I don't know why they are there. 
The playthrough is suprisingly fun, exploring the story islands take time so you don't rush through it. There are different story islands with different 'challenges' to master and some useful blueprints to find. 
Leaving early access just meant, they finished the storyline.

[u]survival[/u]
They took it serious with survival. Really serious. We play on 'normal' difficulty and the frequenzy my char need to eat or drink is ridiculous. It is not fun to have to fish every 5 minutes because you are hungry the whole time. Same with water. Exploring (the story islands) becomes so annoying because you need (minimum) 2 bottles of water and at least 10 fish. Not to mention the way you get food. The standard fishing rod is broken after 8 fish. What is that? Any other way to get food? Well yes, but actually no. Mushrooms can only be found, potatoes and redbeets are getting eaten by the fcking bird the whole time (even you have scarecrow) and give like 5% wow. The few animals you can barely find on islands give steaks, same goes to the fcking bird and the shark. But that's it. And they give like 20%, like nothing. 

[u]shark[/u]
Your 'main' problem should be the shark, but he is no problem at all. You don't even need armor to survive 4 attacks. The only problem is his hunger of raft. I don't know why this shark likes eating plastic and wooden planks but fine, go for it. While you fish the whole time and scare the bird, you also have to take care to the sharky. Because he also likes to eat every 5 minutes just like you. Annoying.

[u]building[/u]
Uhm, I'm really disappointed. The raft building is hardly limited. Just 2 different foundation forms and no diversity in decoration parts at all. (Yea, it's limited by the material you can get from the water but cmon). Everything is expensive to build, sharky eats it the whole time and you don't even get the time to build your raft. Less 'deco' objects, more diversity in shapes and it would be worth the material grind. 
No added elements 'til they left early access. Sad.
Sadly, you cannot build anything on isands. I would have liked a summer house at the beach on an island, plant some trees and potatoes and just enjoy. But that's not possible. 

[u]crafting[/u]
Crafting is nice. You can craft every armor and weapon in your inventory (no workbench thanks) and material cost are mostly fine. The cooking/shake station is fun to use (although not worth at all). 

[u]""Exploring""[/u]
""Exploring"" because there is nothing to explore in this game. Every island looks exactly the same, no buildings or caves to explore. Just hop on it, chop the treees, gather some metal and copper and go. The sizes are also a joke. They could have done more. Much more if I compare it with the story islands ... but they didn't because reasons. I really thought ""yea just early access problems. They will add some new islands with stuff on it"" No. Just no.
Underwater is nothing btw. Only the shark and water. Sad as well. 

[u]mechanics[/u]
Combat is a joke. Clunky, broken hitboxes and just a few weapons without unique playstyles. Why did they release it like this? That's what early access stands for. Development. But they only developed the story. that' all. No bugs or hitboxes fixed and you can jump higher+wider with 30fps. What a joke. Big disappointment.

[u]game modes/difficulty[/u]
normal is annoying and hard is a bit harder than normal. Because of the points above, I only can recommened the creative mode, deleting all the survival elements to really get the time to build your raft. 
But, for me, even creative mode doesn't make any fun because of the hard limited building elements. 

TL:DR
The game looks promising but everything is hardly limited. Story is fine and fun, but exploring normal islands is clearly disappointing because they are all the same without buildings/caves. Base building could be nice in creative mode only, but you have just 2 different element shapes and 385431 deco objects. False priorities in my opinion. The shark is no danger at all and the bird is just annoying without any reason to but him into the game, sry not sry. The only things you do the whole time in this game are: fishing, scare the bird, hit the shark, chop trees on islands, repeat. Oh, and you character is hungry/thirsty 24/7, but the food is bad. Crafting system is fine and fair at least. 

3/10"
6780,"Survival crafting games with a proper progression and story are few and far between, and I tend to love each of them whenever they come around. Raft's story isn't necessarily as interesting or cohesive as games like The Forest, but its base building is where it really shines in return; there's a huge amount of customization you can do in building your raft and decorating it as you see fit, and by the end of the game it really does start to feel like a proper home. The gameplay loop is a lot of fun, there's plenty of items to research and craft, and the act of navigating the ocean is just fun in its own right. 

The only real complaint I have is that the pacing leaves a lot to be desired in the second half of the game, with many of the end game recipes come far too late for you to have time to actually build or get use out of them before the story is over. A lot of recipes aren't even found until the final island, meaning they're basically useless unless you take the time to stop progressing and run back to your raft for some reason. It's a strange decision that feels like Spore-esque rushed development, but I can't really complain considering I got 30 hours of fun out of the game regardless. If you can string a few friends along to play in co-op, it's all the better."
6781,very fun
6782,good game but all i see is spoilers  all over the place so now i want to shot myself
6783,10/10 graphics are amazing
6784,"Look, I love this game. But I also have anxiety and I scare easily. Peaceful mode was incredible and afforded me the ability to have fun in this amazing, interesting world. However, with the most recent update that finished the story, I've had my wits scared out of me several times by attacking mobs. I understand some things are necessary for the story -- but some things aren't. Some things are just there to make the game more difficult, more challenging. That may be fun for a lot of people. But when you have a peaceful mode in a game, it's expected to be PEACEFUL. 

I'll keep playing, but until these things change to match the ""peaceful"" label, I can't finish the story myself. It causes me too much stress. To anyone like me, I can't recommend the game, not fully. To people who love these challenges, get the game -- it IS a great game."

6813,fun game :)
6814,"This game is so addicting, its got a somewhat minecraft feel but way more intense as in you have to be a bit more organized and things are a little harder to come by. starting out is the hardest, but at no point in the game are you at a safe point, theres always SOMETHING needing your attention. love the new update, i was playing the beta on my sons steam but now that we all want to play together my hubby set me up on my dead steam account JUST for this game. thats how badly we are all addicted!"

6816,"I've been a huge fan of this game for maybe a year? Maybe two? It's the absolute best survival-craft game I have in my library. I love the creative elements of this game. Everything is so well balanced, there is so much to explore (especially on the story islands) and there are endless ways to build your raft in an efficient and aesthetic way. Hats off to the creators, as well, for their involvement with their community. This is one of those games that is SO much fun to start over from scratch, over and over again. And, in my opinion, it's timeless. This is probably one of those games I'll boot up 10 years from now, just for old time's sake."

6859,"I recommend this game because it is so engaging and I especially love the fact that you rely on trash in the ocean to survive on your own in the middle of the ocean. Once you know how to play, it gets really fun and somewhat easy."
6860,its a fun game once you get the hang of it
6861,"pretty good game
probally more fun with friends
but i dont have any xD
so i dont know"
6862,"My son and I got this game 2 years ago.  We've been playing together ever since every time there is an update.  Super sad that the latest was the last update, such a great game.  Tons of hours of fun with my boy."
6863,"this is a very fun game solo and multiplayer i love the graphics its very pretty and unique i dont see many other games with this art style :)
"
6864,"Viholliset on aika helppoja. Vain yksi vihollinen pelissä meinasi tuottaa ongelmia. Rakentaminen on ihan hauskaa, mutta pelin oudon konseptin vuoksi kaikkea ei keretty tehdä. Juuri kun viimeinen craftaus materiaali oli saatu unlokattua niin tulikin jo viimeinen paikka vastaan ja moni blueprint jäi käyttämättä. Blueprinttejä sai myös viimeisestä paikasta. Näistä siis hyötyä jos haluaa jatkaa storyn jälkeen peliä. Me olisimme mieluusti halunneet nämä tehdä storyn aikana kun meitä ei enää huvikseen rakentelu jaksanut innostaa. Tämä jäi harmittamaan. Muutoin peli oli kaverin kanssa hauska. Hintaisekseen tarjoaa edullista viihdettä 2 henkilölle noin 30-40h ajaksi (story) ja pidemmäksikin ajaksi jos storyn jälkeen jaksaa vielä huvikseen rakennella."
6865,"A delightful survival/exploration sim with an interesting storyline. Highlights were the soundtrack, and sense that I always had something to work towards. Lows included getting the top end tools only to find out that they're incredibly grindy to actually build, and require you to essentially artificially delay your story progression to pursue. Would have liked them to be a bit more accessible and necessary for the finale. That said, I quite enjoyed it, and would happily play again with friends."
6866,accurate simulation for somalia
6867,I love this game the new update is so fun! its totally worth it
6868,it is very fun in early-mid gamewhich is easy to get to if you have knowledge and skill
6869,"This game is quite fun if I say so myself especially when you have a friend to play beside you while you go on an amazing yet difficult adventure on this post-apocalyptic water world. I would Recommend more grace time for when you kill a shark , but other than that it is an outstanding game."
6870,GREAT GAME
6871,it good

6882,"This is definitely one of the games of all time.
Here is a pros and cons list:
pros:
+ game has seggule
+ lots of customization options
+ very fun multiplayer experience
+ cool areas to explore (especially with friends)

cons:
- game wants you to kill seggule
- food and water goes down even when you stand still
- no anime figures as rare drops from fishing
- no anime figures as rare drops from crates
- no anime figures in vending machines
- no playable femboy character"
6883,"The last chapter (Utopia) is unbalanced and significantly more difficult and painstaking if you try to play it in solo. For me it is a big downer vs the other parts of the game. The jumping obstacles are out of character vs other parts, and I genuinely dislike that type of obstacles (I don't buy that type of games at all) and the hyenas are OP for solo play. It is a huge downer at the end."

6923,"Initially very much in the deep end, you'll learn quick - anchor your Raft!

Great fun in a group especially with voice comms (currently only text comms in game).

Story is a bit slow to grasp at the initial phase, but once you understand the puzzles (your book 'T' is your friend) you'll be away sailing!

Save files can be shared, note this is a P2P game, so host needs to be solid and if they go offline all others are kicked off.

Solid group game and decent combination of story, exploration, amusement and difficulty.

Recommended."

6929,shark goes nom
6930,"Calling all survivalcraft fans! Raft is sure to scratch that itch. And don't let motion sickness stop you, they do have a setting to reduce that. 

Pros:
- amazing soundtrack and sound design
- tons of items and materials to collect and organize
- so many customization objects for your raft
- 8 person online multiplayer
- strong visual style 
- variety of generated and custom islands
- engaging story
- engaging gameplay loop with plenty to do (fishing, sailing, swimming, building, collecting, hunting, etc.)
- plenty of achievements to hunt post-story

Cons:
- unlockable PCs could be more intertwined in main story
- (on Normal solo) difficulty plateaus noticeably if you are compulsive about collecting and storing resources
- wish there were more background tracks (they're so good!)"
6931,I had purchased the game a long time ago from my experience it was a lonesome game play. I found it hard for me to enjoy it with how bad my old pc was and how it still ran around 20 fps without a gpu. I will give it another go again this time keeping it in my inventory as a collection since I wouldn't be able to find anyone to play this game with. I do have a better pc that I built and this game should be light work on it.
6932,"Raft has an awesome story, cool mechanics and great graphics and music. Chapter 3 took a while but it is finally here. I am sure I spent 20 or 30+ hours here (but playing offline doesn't count your hours) since there is always something to do here. I love this game."

6949,"The raft building, crafting and recipe progression is very satisfying. Not a huge fan of the durability wear on items though, found a mod to remove it. I feel like a good middle ground would be between 2-3x as much durability per item."
6950,"k
"
6951,👍
6952,"This poorly balanced game requires constant micromanagement and puts you under huge time pressures. The hook mecanic isn't very satisfying to use, the raft cannot be reconstructed even though it's just a fucking plank at the start.

The inventory management is catastrophic, you can't hold many kinds of items... So god forbid the 6 seeds in your pockets are not the same color or else you won't be able to put anything else inside!

The game is overall pretty ugly, and the world is so far bland and uninteresting, the game design  is dissapointing as highlighted above. Not a fun game."

6956,its a fun game
6957,Great story and well made :)
6958,"Overall: 8.5/10 and about 55 hours long if you focus on the story.

Pros:
Great story (though I played it for the first time after the final chapter came out which I guess included a re-write).
Great raft customization.
Game rewards efficient raft design.
Good survival vibes.
Good tech progression.
More varied gameplay than I thought there'd be.
Puzzles reminiscent of Myst.
Simplistic combat (plus for me, wasn't playing it to tryhard).
Gorgeous environments.
Very good soundtrack.

Cons:
Resource farming heavy (perpetual wood shortage, need to revisit locations to make all upgrades).
Underwater boss is a bit buggy.

Interesting to note:
Player only ever fights animals, may make it more suitable for children."
6959,good game yep
6960,"It's a fun game, but let me say the ""best"" part of the experience.  Along out perilous journey, we ran into a llama.  My friend decided to name that llama Kuzco.  I inquired as to why.  I found out about a film called 'The Emperor's New Groove'  A film I had never watched.

Now I have.  The film is bloody fantastic.  Thank you Raft for introducing me (kinda) into a great film!"

6962,SHAAAAARRRRRRRK!
6963,"The game started out pretty fun and entertaining but you are quickly struck down by the miserable and infuriatingly bad mechanics and design choices in this shitshow. Oh you accidentally fell in the water for 2 seconds? well there's a shark who just somehow knows to be right up your ass the moment you fall in and eats you. Farm an island for like 30 mins just to get blown up by a random fart fish who does 50% of your hp as a dot and you lose everything and there's no way to get it back? spend 10 mins chasing a chicken to kill and eat it only to find out it has absolutely no value and you get nothing for it? ya really alluring concepts here with this game... NOT. what a waste of time. You spend most of the start of the game struggling for food and 95% of what you eat barely has any value, you get like 5% of your food bar. yet a cup of water fills like 25%.. this is a survival game and irl its literally the opposite, you can survive so much longer without food than water, why does food just basically do nothing? and you gotta eat like every 5 mins or you just become a slug who cant run or do anything.. Just basic upkeep is a miserable grind and you barely get to progress because you're just struggling to get the bare minimum as this annoying ass shark eats your boat and you gotta waste resources to fix it. GL progressing like that.. -10/10 would not recommend wasting your time on this game if you want a fun survival experience. find something better."

6980,Its a good game. Can be a little frustrating to figure out the first few times you play and can get a bit repeptitve. Youll probably make some of the same mistakes I did starting out but once you get the hang of it its really enjoyable and challenging.
6981,i play this game and have a mental breakdown every single time
6982,"Day 28:

We decided to build a bar, named ""The Back View Lounge."" While constructing the floor of the bar and the walls, our builder made a mistake and accidentally went into the goat enclosure. ""Tax Fraud"" was found safely and returned to our repaired enclosure. ""JFK"" was nowhere to be found though. Lord knows when he disappeared, but the shark was behind us so we suspect he did not last long.

7052,"If You Like Games That are sandboxes, Have Lots of story Or Can Pour Hours Into, This Game Is For You."
7053,"tl;dr summary - Raft is everything Stranded Deep failed to be due to bugs and poorly thought out game play, while Raft manages to bring its own unique style and character to make for a great craft, gather, explore game. Don't spend your money on Power Washing Simulator if you want a satisfying vibe out game because this is WAYYYYY more satisfying!! If you wanna vibe and craft and sail, this is definitely a game worth buying!

Don't let first looks fool you, there's a lot going on with Raft.  There's a pretty involved story, lots of crafting and building mechanics to play with, and a few special locations that set this game apart from other similarly themed titles.  The background music is great ambient and the game feels very alive as you float aimlessly through a tropical sea.

Coming out in close proximity to the release of Stranded Deep it's hard not to compare Raft to it, and hopefully how they compare is good context - I bought both, and gave up on Stranded Deep about 2 days in because Raft is so much better.  Here's how they stack up:

- Graphics: Kind of a toss up; don't exactly love the cartooney style of Raft, but Stranded Deep is a literal asset lift from engine assets so giving this one to the Raft team on effort alone.  The Raft team has created a lot of unique and creative assets for Raft, and while they're a bit on the goofy side the models are really expressive and fun (a water purifier running off a cartoon wet-dry vac for example), so I can't hate on them too hard.  

- Audio: Hands down win to Raft (get used to it).  Lots of very subtle and not so subtle audio queues do a really nice job of keeping you moving from task to task and keeping you aware of all the benches at work on your raft.  Meanwhile, in Stranded Deep your watch beeps at you whenever you're hungry, thirsty, or getting sunburned somehow....

- Game play:  I haven't thrown my mouse out of frustration at bugs from playing Raft yet, while the temptation was very real with Stranded Deep several times.  Gonna call this one a Harlem Globetrotters vs. Washington Generals tier win for Stranded Deep

- Mechanics:  Raft's mechanics seem to mostly work, and you can do some really fun stuff with them.  Stranded Deep won't even let you build basic things on your raft.  Hands down win for Raft

- Environment:  Stranded Deep is a series of dinky procedurally generated islands and mannequin fly-bys of various ocean species and some randomly spawned bosses with horrible animations.  Raft has  bigger more diverse islands and reefs, and you can actually interact with most of the scenery.  Closer call, but still goes to Raft

- Survival:  Stranded Deep had some interesting ideas for cooking and metabolism and included sun exposure (granted it didn't work half the time), where Raft keeps it really basic with just food and water and food items just buff each of those to varying degrees. Slight edge to Stranded Deep on this one for at least having some diversity in diet items

- Co-op:  if you play Stranded Deep with a friend, at least you have someone to laugh at all the bugs with as you play.  Hands down experience win for Raft where crafting and sailing is a great way to kill time and do some exploring. 

- Overall Value:  Hands down win to Raft.  I played exactly 6.5 hours of Stranded Deep before the bugs and poorly thought out game mechanics got to be too much for me despite how much I wanted it to be a great game.  I've now been playing Raft for about 50 hrs since launch, and honest to god have to SET AN ALARM to remind myself to stop playing."

Now that's not to say that it doesn't have it's issues ( Few and far between but still there ) sometimes when new stuff comes out it doesn't work correctly instantly but props to the developers they usually fix it fairly fast puzzles , object collision so on but in the end faults are fixed quickly most the time

Best game iv'e played in a while not had a game that has grabbed my attention so much in ages, I am so disappointed the main story is over though , I hope they add more. Even if it was DLC i would happily pay up to £20 for a DLC aslong as it was reasonably made and worth the money. I would highly recommend playing this game with as little knowledge as possible on the game though, The aspect of trying to figure out where resources are and finding things out really makes the experience. and there is plenty of different experiences. Different things the further you explore."

7100,"I absolutely love this game. My friends and I played 10-12 hours straight because the fun really just never ends. The puzzles included in the lore are the perfect amount of fun and challenging, and the dialogue itself is very captivating and well-told despite minimal NPC interaction.

There were around 7-8 of us playing and we all really enjoyed being able to build the raft to our heart's content (provided that we had all the materials required), as well as figuring out and allocating roles in order to properly function as a team (i.e P1 navigates, P2 gathers food/fishes, P3 is in charge of cooking, P4 is in charge of shark lookout, P5 gathers raw materials, P6 mines underwater etc). SUPER fun with friends and genuinely one of the only games where we all wanted to continue playing because everyone wanted to- this coming from a group with extremely varying and opposite tastes in games. 

Otherwise, I guess the most challenging thing was figuring out hunger and thirst levels in the early stages of the game. very good. Super exciting, though I'm not much of a critic."
7101,Amazing game
7102,"Raft is fun and reasonably priced. It's not perfect though. Here's my conclusion after completing the story (normal difficulty):

GOOD
- Building/expanding your raft and surviving is fun. If you want you can make your raft into a boat, well... kinda.
- Feeling of progression.
- Exploration.
- No gamebreaking bugs/crashes (for me atleast). If you ever should get stuck, there is an unstuck option in the menu.

NEUTRAL
- Story is OK-ish.

BAD
- Your constantly hungry and thirsty.
- The shark is not a real threat, just very annoying. It spawns at fixed time intervals.
- Gathering food and materials is grindy.
- Puzzles! I did not care for the amount of puzzles in this game, even if some of them could be ""fun"".
- Some of the blueprints are discovered way too late in the story progression. Why give me new blueprints moments before I've completed the story? They're of no use to me now."

7105,"As you'd expect, this game is akin to the majority of survival games out there but this is done very well indeed. It's time consuming solo but very satisfying too. The mechanic loop is pretty good - get resources, craft, explore. My only issue is that the map is pregenerated so all the locations are the same, if it were procedural it would be much more of a surprise to find certain areas/islands. I do think some of the crafted items are given to you a little late but it's a great game, fun, allows for limitless creativity and so far I've had an absolute blast."
7106,Its a fun game where your on a raft and explore islands.I also like the story line but one bug is if the shark breaks a piece of your 2x2 and then breaks another one diagnal then your entire raft will break and you will have to restart. I found this out the hard way because i didnt know and a lot of my stuff [ which i had some stuff that it would take a while to get ] was basicly gone. other then that I like the game
7107,Nice
7108,Played close to 30 hrs in 3 days.
7109,nice
7110,good
7111,nice
7112,other than the first hour where I softlocked the game because you can actually have your raft get fully destroyed and you can't build on anything except raft pieces... the game is actually really good. I love the fact that what you build isn't just something you come back to but is the main home and transportation in the game.
7113,Good with friends.  A bit tough and the sharks are quite annoying.
7114,Sailing the ocean is relaxing until Bruce decides to eat the block underneath your storage. Pro tip: reinforce.
7115,really funny :D
7116,Really good game
7117,"Raft is a good game i like it because it has good quality and has puzzles, there's even a story in it. It's also fun because you can play with friends, and most of all... FRANK he's a shark that really likes chomping my FRICKING RAFT!!! soooo... after some days i may or may not killed Frank... and i have a reason! He almost made me bankrupt with materials, but then Franks sister or brother came and started doing what Frank did... so that's my story! Have a good day! :)"
7118,This was not worth my 20 dollars
7119,yeah its a good game with people witch we need an good discord server for
7120,earth in 2100
7121,ye recommend it
7122,i'd sell my unborn child to replay this game for the first time again.
7123,well theres a raft...
7124,"If you are looking to have a blast with your friends or test your survival skills, this game is for you. What i like most about Raft is being able to play it over and over again without getting bored, you can look for lore or go from island to island upgrading your raft. I played for almost 20 hours and i don't think that i'm going to stop there. Great co-op game, highly recommended."
7125,good game ending was ass
7126,Good game and the graphics and the interaction with objects is spot on unlike many other open world games
7127,I would highly recommend this game.
7128,"Hard is fun! I just got one-shot killed by a death squad of sharks. 
Can recommend!"
7129,gg
7130,good game
7131,If you enjoy building and puzzles then you would surely enjoy Raft. There is so much to do that you will stay busy. It's a great game with friends or solo. It isn't too rough for the casual player so I think you'll have a good time. Plus once you complete the story you can cruise around to make your raft even more amazing. There are endless possibilities with this game and I hope that there will be more from this game in the future.
7132,Good game
7133,"The exploration is much deeper than I expected with lots of interesting and unique biomes. Will not spoil, but there are also lots of puzzles to be solved. It is a really fun game to play with friends.

It's a shame it does not support dedicated servers, though. You can only have local games and if you are on, your friends can join you. Otherwise, the co-op is great and fun."
7134,S H O R K
7135,Not the best survival game. Getting ressources is too hard in the beginning and too easy towards the end. The story is not well presented and needs a big touch up. The enemies are so god damn annoying compare to other survival games (this stupid ahh shark).
7136,"Finished the game. The game was all but intuitive, felt very empty, wasted many interesting mechanics and the advancements were badly spread during the game. Not worth over 10$. The fun stuff arrives when you finally finish and there isn't any real endgame. There is real potential though if the devs keep updating the game."
7137,to much water
7138,"After playing before the full release, it ended uneventful and my friends and I were so excited for the full release in hopes of so much more. We were obsessed! Then we get together to play the full release. Enjoyed getting to the point we had before and getting past that. Then it just kind of ends the same it did before full release. Uneventful and disappointing. There's still so much more they could have done."
7139,"All in all this game is a pretty fun experience with friends, you get to build cool things and have some laughs along the way, but I genuinely cannot see the appeal of doing it solo or even really wanting to replay it.

The story after Taronga feels really lackluster and isn't very compelling, with the final island being a really boring experience that genuinely felt rushed. The game didn't feel like it was ready to end when suddenly the final cutscene was playing with my friend and I just sitting there asking ""that's the end?""

I can recommend it as a fun time with friends to see what you can build, but that's about it."
7140,Very fun i will say its kind of hard to get started in the beginning and i recommend playing on easy mode at first.
7141,good
7142,um belo de um jogo
7143,"I didn't LOVE the game when I first got it, but came back after the updates.
It's like a whole new game. I love the new crafting elements and the farming aspect. 
What I don't love is the amount of hours I can foresee myself sinking into this game ;)"
7144,very good game
7145,"Epic. I never run out of stuff to do in this game. Whoever made this needs a reward, maybe even a trophy."
7146,love this game. way more addicted then i ever thought id be
7147,"It will entertain you for ~20h, that time is enough to build a fancy 4xEngine raft with almost everything automated and then complete the whole story on normal difficulty.

The biggest complain from me - 0 replayability, you will never touch this game again after completion.

Last 4 Story ""Islands"" are kinda the same with minor additions, gameplay becomes dull and not entertaining. 

Utopia island is a total joke, you just follow the fully scripter route from start to end with no exploiration and no variation, all puzzles are way too easy and it gets boring after 10 min,,,"
7148,Sharkey Sharkey scawy '>.<
7149,my only complaint is I have no friends to play with
7150,good

7152,"It took me forever to finally buy Raft but I love this game so much. I didn't realize i purchased it right when the full game came out. Perfect timing. I love building the raft and collecting so many things. I have like 1 heads up this isn't controller compatible there are going to be a few stressful parkour things in the game when it comes to trying to go through the story line islands so be prepared to scream at your computer screen. And your screaming at your health thirst and hunger. But yes this game is very fun I highly recommend anyone to play it.

7156,Fun game with a lot to do

7159,"Just finished the storyline for the first time. Steam says I have plugged 57 hours in it already. And only have played solo and haven't played with others yet. And being a stroke survivor, survival games are kinda my go to. But here is my Review:

The gameplay loop is a bit tricky to get used to, since the movement of the water messing with your timing. But once you get it down. You're a pro and very enjoyable and rewarding. The crafting system is very well done. The way you can just craft materials that is needed out of your inventory for what you are trying to craft. Makes it a lot easier and quicker to craft on what you want without going through all the menus to find what you need. The system isn't prefect though. You can't craft materials that you need when your out of something to make something out of chests. You have to put the materials that is needed into your inventory. The islands that you run into are a great mix. I got a good amount of middle to large islands during my playthrough. Making middle game resources very abundant. The down side to that is that the little islands became kinda obsolete for me. When it came to the late game islands. They were a good challenge, but the spike was real for me. My left hand had trouble keeping up with the jumping puzzles at times. So controller support would be a great addition to the game. The speech audio was a bit quite for me, I had to turn down all the other sounds and keep the speech and max just to be able to here the people talk. I am not to sure, but there is a track or two that is really quite and counldn't hear that well. So it seemed like there was no music playing. But when the music does come one, it is very relaxing and calming, like the type of music you would wanna listen to while you raft away on the open see. 

I very much enjoying the game and highly recommend it for people who enjoy survival games, and i believe would be a good one for beginners asd well. I am going to keep on floating on and build my raft to exactly one how i want it now and play around with the very end game stuff. and going to try there other game now Scrap Mechanic."

7162,I hate making furnaces
7163,"Friends not included. :(

Seriously, playing solo is pretty much easy mode or hardcore.
Hardcore is not really fun, losing 2/3 of your stuff early basically ends the run, so what the game requires?
Friends to revive you.
If you have that, you'll have a great time!!!"
7164,epic
7165,"Very good game, worth the price everyone buy this"
7166,good
7167,"
Short version:
Great game, bit slow at the start with grindy achievements but a LOT of fun regardless!

Long ""Ranty"" Version :P
Think i ended up getting this game donated (like so many others) Raft is by my standards a pretty fun game, 
The story is fun and now all the little bits of info you find are voiced which makes it even easier to follow. Some of the newer added mobs are fun, game was not being very diverse in earlier stages.
I personally love to explore all the story islands and seeying all the sights and mobs and learning what happened.
BUT i also have a few gripes with this game. 
The start of the game makes me wanna fall asleep, you spend a LOT of time tossing your hook at resources before you can expand your raft a bit proper and make a bit of space for yourself, the shark is a constant menace in this endevour (and it should be) but the moment you make your raft out of reinforced foundations he becomes a joke, if you got a tad further and expand your raft in such a manner that the shark is sticking to one end of the raft you don't even have to bother with bait anymore (unless you wanna bait-camp the crap out of it for food i guess :P) because it's AI can't be bothered to find you anymore.
Speaking of food, your character has to eat so much and often in this game it's a miracle they are as skinny as they look. You stuff an entire cooked shark in your face and not even half a day later you're hungry again. it also feels as if you have to drink almost constantly, i know this is a crafting survival game but imho the food/water decay is a bit too fast but that's just me i guess.
Some of the achievements in this game are a downright grind to complete, killing 50 sharks is not that hard, but some of the other things like the schreechers? have fun sailing back and forth between 2-3 large islands to get the 50 kills. The 25 deaths achievement is also a headscratcher to me, imho death's shouldn't be an achievement. If the achievement was to complete or survive 365 days without dying for example, now that i can get behind.

Anyways i've been ranting long enough.
"
7168,A ton of fun with my friends. Highly recommend not reading about the story line and just jumping right in to figure out the world. Super cool to discover things as they come
7169,shit game

7184,"The game runs well if you have a decent computer, and looks great! The story is good and you don't really have to even do the story if that's your thing. There's a lot of different building pieces to customize a raft, and so much to do, as I have so many hours on it. It's worth the price, and you should get it, unless you hate fun."
7185,good

7187,Me and my wife love this game and have played a couple of times before 1.0. Would love a Raft 2 and even some DLC on this one. The gameplay is very fun and has a lot of content. I wish more Early Access games turned out as well as this. Well done!!
7188,"Fun with friends, a grind solo but still a good pass time"
7189,good
7190,The game is completely annoying I don't know what to say. I was a big fan of the game but actually playing it is just rage inducing.

7192,it's like minecraft without the minec
7193,"Amazing Game, And Really Fun."
7194,chill coop game
7195,"Raft is an open world / survival & crafting game where you try to survive on a raft as it floats over the ocean. Gameplay is really fun, variety of craftables are exciting, exploring new places like islands and learning new blueprints are charming. Game is beginner friendly, easy to learn, tasks and directives are very clear.

Overall, raft is an easy recommendation and a must play for survival fans."
7196,its super fun and why not get it
7197,this is a fun game be careluf of bruse (the shark) differnt modes and a multiplayer game or a solo one as well good luck.
7198,water good shark bad
7199,highly enjoyable game with your friends
7200,"This is such a great survival, crafting story.  There IS a great story too.  I'm not a huge fan of the voice-over of the notes, but that's because I'm rarely JUST playing the game.  I would much rather pause and read the notes myself at my own pace.

If I had any other complaint it is that there isn't really a tutorial and there is an assumption that you (the player) already know things like ""tab"" to open your inventory.  But, once you know what to do - all the control are really intuitive and easy to use.

The game play itself is excellent.  I LOVE that I can decide how difficult a game I want to play.  There are days I'm not up for any serious difficulty, and having a ""peaceful"" version that I can get on and build and focus on the story is GREAT.  Then when I want more challenge, I can have worlds with greater challenge level.

The story.  There is actually an interesting story.  I haven't finished it yet, but I'm up to Chapter 6 (I think) and I am fairly engrossed in finding out what happens! I really hope they put as much in the ending as they have in the beginning and middle sections of this game."

7209,"GOOD
"
7210,Shark Bait oo ha ha
7211,its fun
7212,its cool
7213,"If you play solo this game is such a major bitch to progress in. First struggles always are food and water because for some reason the character has the energy household of a nuclear reactor. Once you have that ""established"" the next grind is resources which you have to collect tediously while always constantly drowning and having your raft parked half a mile away to avoid the shark. Once you reach the first major islands there is wildlife that will just annoy the shit out of you by attacking you without rest and you most probably will die. And the game just decides to autosave on death. So your food and equipment is gone on respawn. Zero motivation to continue. Playing solo is a big no. Absolute waste of time with such factors."
7214,I do recomend it but it is kinda anoying when you die and you cant get the other 2/3 of you stuff back
7215,"I like it, Picasso"
7216,Fun game to relax and chill with friends. Not as stressful as some of the other survival games I have played. Has neat craftables and cute cartoon graphics for the animals.

7222,this game graphics are way to high and even though i lower them to worst graphics and it still ran slower than my tablet at low battery. i recommend if you have a really good computer. but dont waste 20 dollars if it does not work well.
7223,"THIS GAME IS AMAZING!!!!!!!!

7224,raft good shark bad story fun
7225,W
7226,"Although the game is fun and different the needs are lame even at easy you can be starving after eating 4 watermelons really only to or so secs and the meter is down ,Also shark attack never ends making it extra frustrating. So if you want a game that will make you want to punch your pc and ask why this is the game ."
7227,its so cool man
7228,"I bought this game in early access, I loved the first few free builds that were on itch back in the day, it showed a lot of promise... The full game is good, the building system is really in-depth and you can make some pretty cool things. The story on the other hand, the concept is cool but the execution is all wrong.

I played this game multiplayer with a friend of mine, he was the host. I'll admit that I don't have good internet, but my internet isn't *that* bad. However, this game has some very stupid bugs and glitches that made multiplayer frustrating. 

Later in the story there are a few ""boss"" like areas. These areas are awful, I wouldn't consider trying to do this game in hardcore, because these fights can be completely unfair and it's way to easy to get locked into an animation with an enemy or get hit away from the oxygen source and drown. 

I had to take several breaks to cool down from getting frustrated at how broken and unfair the game felt at times."
7229,I would definitely recommend this game to anyone looking for something to play with their friends. I play this with my girlfriend and we have a blast exploring islands and building our raft which has become more of a yacht at this rate. If you're looking for a relatively simple yet very fun and survival game I highly recommend Raft.

7244,I have played this game for 6 hours and i already love it. The mechanic where when you die you loose 2/3 of your stuff is really the only bad part.

But the thing is, I got this game for my brother so he could play it too, but he wasn't able to because of the fact that it's not available on mac. That's the only bad thing about this game.

7269,I really like this game the updated have been amazing. The only complaint I would have is that i cant use a controller
7270,Pretty good gameplay... ionno about that ending tho
7271,Tourner das le vide vide Tourner das le vide vide Tourner das le vide vide le videeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee

get items
expand would length
lose wood to horny creature trying to eat it
cri (it hurt)
repeat but in raft"
7276,An amazing game. It feels so realistic and it's also so fantasy like at the same time. I feel like it's such a good mix and more game should do the same.
7277,i've been following the game's development and updates for 2 years now and i'm finally glad to say i finished the story! the game still has a lot of stuff to offer and i could replay it with friends anytime. was truly worth the wait for the final chapter and has had a lot of effort put into it :) a very cherishing game that i've played with so many friends. i will always have a good say with this game :)
7278,"A mostly fun game completely ruined by frustrating jumping puzzles paired with an awful, janky jumping system that suffers from lag in multiplayer.

Also, there is no save system. It's 2022 and someone created a game that can't be saved."
7279,very epoc like smth
7280,Game said i played 3 hours. I had the game in my library for that much time but didnt play for that much time. this game is not fun. its the same things. Game moves you to places. if you are playing alone this game is not worth the time and effort you put into it. Everything breaks too fast and the game itself is just too slow. Save your money this game isnt worth it

7282,"One of the greatest games. Simply amazing.  Great atmosphere, gameplay and much more. Get a friend hop on a raft and enjoy one of the best games you’ve yet to enjoy."
7283,One of the best survival game
7284,What can I say... Raft has evolved over the last few years to transform into a fully functional game. It Has end game content now and even on easy it can be very challenging but possible and maintainable. if you love survival games like The Forest I would definitely recommend this game to you.
7285,"if your bored of mc, play this"
7286,"Get ready for a super fun adventure! Build the ultimate raft-home, craft many useful contraptions, seek out mysterious islands and discover all their secrets, fish all the fish, fight Bruce the shark and don't forget to invite a friend.

Be warned: if you have a tendency to be a perfectionist in designing things, you can sink days into just raft design and getting everything just perfect (I'm looking at you, paint brush).  I've mostly run this game in solo mode, and having some co-op buddies makes it even better as you can then dole out jobs and not have to do everything yourself.

""OY!  Bill!  Need some more fishies on the grill there mate""

In my personal opinion, the 3rd chapter was a bit of a let down compared to chapters 1 and 2.  The ending itself was lackluster, and the final islands felt slightly less exploratory and more of a linear progression.  That being said, they were still fun to play, but just didn't hold up to the previous locations."

7296,"dummy thicc game, very swole, 100 fire."
7297,"7/10 Game is VERY fun with FRIENDS i personally couldn't play it alone as it was boring being solo but with a group of friends it was a great time! In my opion its a good game but it doesn't hold much replayabilatiy, but its a soild game for the price point i would def pick this up if you have friends that can play it with you."
7298,good
7299,its fun but trust me its hard to beat the game and not get stuck on an island with no food and water are just not having wood while doing a story island but its realy fun so reccomend it
7300,k
7301,"Great way to lose track of time, the music and general atmosphere are super calming...shark can get annoying until you get the metal spear, but the biggest pain is the dang giant bird."
7302,Very fun. Love that you can play up to 8 people on one raft. Super hecktic with all the bois but crack up as. Would recommend for sure aye. Love that it keeps getting updates too.
7303,"nice cock
"
7304,"very nice! but i recommend you following the story or it gets a little monotonous :)
best to enjoy with a friend."
7305,Nice Game it makes fun to play with friend.
7306,
7307,its a good game . i just dont like the rat monsters
7308,Yes
7309,very nice and very fun
7310,10/10 would poke shark again
7311,"I've been playing this since back in early access on itch.io. First off, it has come a LONG way since then. I have been loving playing the full release. Granted, I love survival crafts in general, but this one has been especially fun. I highly recommend both as a single player game and as a multiplayer game. Unlike some survival crafts, this one is fairly balanced for single player!"
7312,it's a cute game.
7313,"Very cool Co-op game to play with friends and watch them suffering with the shark.
8.5/10"
7314,"ghjkl/,lkjh"
7315,"I would not recommend playing single player as the game is excrutiatingly slow and frustrating solo. I spent most of my time bobbing along picking up materials, fixing shark damage, distilling water and getting food. 
My thirst and hunger went down too fast for me to explore anywhere as I needed to be on a constant rotation of materials>cook food>distill water>materials>eat food>drink water/water plants. I imagine that this would be easier and quicker with one or more friends but I definately would not recommend solo play.

"
7316,it good asf
7317,"I like what i've seen of this game but when i bought it i hadn't realised there's no controller pad option. Having only recently come across to pc from consoles i'm just not fluid with mouse and keyboard at all. I'm going to leave it a while to see if an update for controllers is eventually released. Why it doesn't already have them included i couldn't guess, i've played other survival games like this one and controllers worked fine."
7318,Great game but you need a good pc to run it
7319,fun raft stuff
7320,"k
"
7321,shit game
7322,"Pros: very good survival game

Cons: If you die and respawn you lose 2/3 of your items. Last time I died it literally took all of my tools when I had zero planks. Basically I can barely continue unless I get a friend to revive me. (Don't take this con too seriously I'm just salty lmao)"
7323,"man, i really enjoyed this game. whatever it is about this game, but the gameplay loop is fantastic. the early parts of the game is survival, and expansions, then the game changes pace to exploration and quest completion. later on in the game, you don't worry about food or water at all. it turns more into an exploration game where you find islands, and find stuff and unlock new blueprints. 

The only thing i could complain about, if i had to pick something was how after some time the game wasn't very challenging. you sorta just kept going forward. the only way you would die would be if you did something foolish. but the rest of the game is just so great. i wish i could just erase that part of my brain and just play this game fresh again. ugh, such a good time. im sad to have finished it. so good."
7324,All around good game... they make good and frequent updates to the game... they do good
7325,A game i always seem to come back to for relaxing and chilling out. Even though i have major thalassophobia I just uh.. don't look in dark areas of the water :'D ????
7326,"Fun to play with friends, call all your friends and invite them to play! it will be fun!

got this game for free from my cousin, definitely worth it even without discount."
7327,The game is very flawed (mostly due to bugs) but it does provide a fun survival game experience worth the price of you have friends.
7328,yes
7329,"fun at times, boring overall. play the forest instead"
7330,nice
7331,Fun game with friends or solo. Can be a lot of micromanaging but I enjoyed that. Feels like if minecraft and subnautica had a baby.
7332,rill kah min
7333,Bueno
7334,"Raft is as a Solo expierence very grindy but still in the ok frame (depending on your taste), as a multiplayer erpierence its way better still very tedouis but way better then solo. The story is confusing and very weird especially at the end. The game mechanics are, again, especially at the end very weird and at some points just simple plain bad.

As a simple guid line:
If you dislike platformer (yes, no joke) stay away, if you want a good story stay away. 
If you want a simple Robinson Crusoe  survival expierence in early to mid game with a little grind - buy it.

The best expierence are the 3 first story points evrything after that feelt rushed, unfished and even unpolished and the closer you come to the end, the more are the game design choices dissconcceted from the base game and making no sense at all. These choices of the dev team at the end belong, in my opinion in a other game but not Raft.

 For 20 € or even less a good game if you dont have a problem with bad story writing or weird to plain bad design choices in late to end game. Its a fun journey and for the price a good buy but far, far away from the praise some people are singing."
7335,"this game is the best when you grind a lot 



(PS: its really!!!! fun when you install mods)"

7346,"Fun relaxing game, except the shark can be a butthead, however, the game wouldn't be as fun without the little bugger. Very fun to challenge myself to build rafts the size and shape of small town maps from other games.
I just adore this game. ^.^"
7347,How about a tutorial or something to walk you through how you play the game????? Absolutely do not recommend and I would give it 1 out of 5 stars based off the fact that there is no information on how to do anything in the game!
7348,"The game is amazing, but it is only fun with friends."

7357,"I cried when Mobius and venom said ""its morbin time"" and proceeded to become venom,also My good friend bryant moreland was also there , (he is known as EDP445) ""And he didnt really do anything wrong just so everyone knows he is innocent and just wanted a cupcake."" because we are venom , and then I started crying when venom teamed up with morbingus and killed spider man from the hit game among us, And then the among us imposter came into the scene and killed scooby doo and fortnite for possesion of illegal drugs , Than lebron james and among us team up with venom and morbingus to take over the world of the space jam, and than after that Rkelly and sonic2 attacked them and then they almost died but morbiobus and lebron james welcomed them to the space jam, and then they played the game team fortress 2 , which was developed by valve who owns will smiths children and family, who I have in my basement steam, After this the movie seems over and calm until the red sus from among us comes from vent and says ""among us sus"" which almost kills venom from the hit movie space jam a new legacy, I also liked the part when venom nukes russia and ukraine and morbiobusbus attacks ukraine with stinky poop, which was kinda scary but honestly I think lebron james and R kelly were great heroes and villans, And then hitler comes back from the dead and tries to kill bee movie, and then among us poo saves bee movie from hitler and they are saved. Morlibbingorbgarfieldiarywimrkellbious was so good and I was so suprised when dwayne ""the rock"" johnson appeared, (stars in jungle movie ) And eats the imposter and says ""among us challenge number 7"" than among us challenge number 7 commences and than number 6 man urinates on a fellow passenger attacks Dwayne ""The rock"" Johnson and his twin brother barack obama who starts brutally killing number 8  and kanye east which made me cry fart and scream at the same time. I think garfield and among us were a pretty good duo as they were both sussy, and garfield does not like mondays as shown in the hit show 1000 pound sisters and then the sus from among us starts having a moment where venom and kendrick lamar sings the hit song called venom by the popular rapper eminem which goes like this ""venom, venom, venom, venom"", and dies, It was so sad when jeffrey epstien and lil mosey died because his cameo was so good. I think this sheds good light on diary of a wimpy kid game six where the kid and EDP445 are against Michael Jordan in the 92-93 nba season. Such a great movie, and I have never seen something this great before,h I got kicked out of my job for ""workplace harassment""  I was just trying to explain how morbiobus was the best thing to ever be made by human kind, Cant wait for my restraining order to be lifted so I can see my kids again. im sorry laura please let me see my son ""its been 6 years im not crazy, im just a morbster and you have to accept me for that please let me see my kids and watch the hit game among us in movie form with morbious laura im sorry . Its morbin time, and I love among us so much and I want my family back,also, eddie brock, and venom who combine into venom and say their hit catchphrase ""we are venom"" and start yelling welcome to the space jam I actually died for a couple seconds and got send to the ER but once on the hospital bed, I got up and ran out as I had to see morbingus and kanye west pooping in 1080p ultra hd if i did not i knew i would die  and I wont pretend that I am morbious and start rolling around the floor with explosive diarrhea again, and I will not use the kids as hostages in any more among us poo
#morbioussweep please rate helpfull"
7358,I play this game with my husband and we have been playing since the early days when you needed ladders to get on taller islands and metal was almost impossible to get! Its so much fun and we are almost done with it so it makes me sad! But overall would recommend this game to anyone wanting a pretty chill survival building game.
7359,"meditative except for the shark that comes and bites you, love collecting supplies"
7360,jogão

7393,"This game is a lot of fun. There is some grinding to do but its worth it. There are a lot of things that you can build, some you need and many you don't. If your goal it to finish the game then its not to bad but if you want the coolest raft on the high sea you will have to put in the time and grind. The final updated add a lot of cool stuff so put on your captains hat and set sail."
7394,REALLY GOOD I LOVE THE CHAPTER 3 UPDATE ITS THE BEST

7408,"Can't recommend this game. The gameplay is fun enough, the idea is great, but it is so poorly optimized. Constant lag in multiplayer with my wife, whether I'm hosting or she is. Desyncs, missed throws of the scrap hook, chests taking 10 seconds to open, and getting kicked for no apparent reason. We've double checked our internet speed, it shouldn't be a problem. (100 down, 20 up). Overall an extremely frustrating multiplayer experience that makes it not fun to play at all."

7441,the shark turned me on
7442,"SPOILERS AHEAD 

Honestly this game was great, all of the story islands were cool, and the puzzles were hard. but the ending is extremely underwhelming. The rhino shark was cooler then the final fight, and the rewards for completing the game feel super underwhelming, it was fun while it lasted, but that ending is just not good."

7452,"Raft is a breeze of fresh air in the craft-like games scene or whatever this genre is called. 

Instead of building a base and exploring the world for supplies and loot, you'll be sailing the ever blue on a small raft starting only with a hook you'll use to pull materials and resources your way so you can expand your raft and build facilities in order to survive the life at sea, while you deal with the most relentless shark the world  has ever seen. 

The graphics are fine, simple and pleasant enough to avoid the photorealistic RTX-on bandwagon and create its own vibe. The sounds are okay and the soundtrack gets boring fast. I've encountered no gamebreaking bugs or glitches and only on a single occasion my game started to lag a bit, which was solved with closing the game and launching it up again. 

The gameplay loop is unfortunately a tad too shallow compared to its progression. Not that the progression is that deep or anything, it just feels that the game runs out of creativity mid to late game and that tunes down a bit the ever present excitement of leaving a location and sailing towards the next. Maybe I've rushed the endgame a bit when I unlocked the last tier materials and facilities, I don't know. Despite what I've said, the gameplay is nothing short of amazing given how exciting it is to explore the sea, stopping at an island for some supplies, fishing late night in, preparing a meal and poking the sharks eye every 5 minutes because dude, that beast is unstoppable. Armor the perimeter of your raft first thing or you won't ever be able to chill a bit and get a tan.

I failed to mention there's multiplayer and there's where the game shines, but I'm a mostly solo player, so that's how I rolled. Life's hard on your own, with friends this game gets far more fun and easy but you need friends in the first place for that. 

The story is there but its pretty much forgettable to the point you completely fail to give it a single fuck. It always strikes your curiosity about how the world flooded up to that point and how people dealt (or failed to deal) with it but the game doesn't do a good job explaining it or making the characters interesting enough. You'll find notes, tapes and bad voice actors telling you stuff but you can ignore it without a care in the world. You won't play this game for the story just like you don't watch porn for the plot, though sometimes we wish there was a good story to be told. In both cases mentioned. Anyway, I digress, back to the review.

I really hope there will be a good amount of endgame content further on for this game. Content of the free kind I hope, though given how the industry (and the players) is nowadays, it's probably gonna be paid stuff. But even so, the game is good enough to make you continue playing it after you've pimped up your raft and finished the story.

On closing notes, get it in a sale or even for full price if you enjoy this kind of game as much as I do. Having played a plethora of craft-like and stuff over the years, it gets challenging to get surprised but this game earns it, definitely."
7453,Very fun game especially with friends
7454,
7455,"pretty easy to get into, starts off easy and progresses enough you dont lose interest, i really like the type of game you have to put some work into tho, so this is right up my alley"
7456,"Fun game with friends and possibly solo. I don't usually like survival games like these, but this is one of the few I enjoyed. Could have a lot of improvements but it's simple and decent."
7457,fun
7458,"This game is a good game with loads more that could be gone because fundamentally its a great concept and fun gameplay. The core gameplay is fun yet relaxing and lets you build something with enough customisation that it becomes something you can truly call your own, whilst maintaining a mild amount of complexity that also makes you think about it. How materials etc were balanced is overall pretty well done but I do say I hate the fact that basically EVERYTHING is a consumable. When you eat out of a bowl you even loose the bowl as if you person just ate a clay bowl for some reason....

All in all the game is a lot of fun but there is one thing that is really a let down and thats the story. Its quaint in its simplicity and functionality but overall its very dull and had me not really caring about any of the characters or what was going on. By the time I felt the story was sort of beginning it was already at an end and the game doesnt really do a good job of trying to get you invested into the story either.

All in all I think the game is worth the purchase for the price because it is a lot of fun and the story does the job of basically pointing you on your upgrade path forwards but dont expect much more of it other than that!"
7459,yup
7460,just great
7461,yay
7462,This Is A Very Good Game :)
7463,"Waterworld (1995) and Minecraft had a baby, and the result was spectacular."
7464,"This game is FANTASTIC. I love that your whole base travels with you! The only thing that drives me nuts is the stack size for items. Most item stacks max out at 20, which means a ton of chests. I really wish the devs would fix this."
7465,yez
7466,"This is a frustrating and sad review to write. I loved this game.  Loved, loved, loved. It could be as chill as I wanted, or as intense. I've come back to it time, and time again. Every so often I return, and play for hours, listening to the chill music, floating on the waves... 

But this latest update... I ... I hate it. I do not like platforming. No..  I HATE platforming. I don't buy games with heavy platforming, because it's not enjoyable in any way for me. It's frustrating, and I have no interest in rage gaming. I play to release stress - not add to it.

WHY they decided, out of nowhere, to add a bunch of mandatory platforming in this latest update is beyond me. Absolutely nothing about it makes sense. It's bizarrely forced. The platforming areas don't even make sense. Why would the people of a town built above water build a series of rotating ""fans"" above platforms... fans that aren't even above anything so serve absolutely zero functional purpose at all. It's a crammed in, obvious, video game platform level in a game that otherwise has felt very organic (for lack of a better word) and not ""gamey"" at all. AND, if you ARE going to force platforming in your game, you BEST have tight controls and no collision issues. All this platforming did is really highlight how loose and clunky the games controls are, which was never a noticeable issue before.

With this recent update, you want to play in ""Peaceful"" mode - that's out the window now, since there's a slew of aggressive creatures that ignore ""peaceful"" settings, forced mob fighting (you HAVE to fight mobs to get the items to progress), and forced boss fights. Boss fights. In Raft. Again... why they decided to shoehorn that in is beyond me. Boss fights in a game like this make ZERO sense to me. ESPECIALLY in peaceful mode. 

Don't offer a peaceful mode if your game doesn't allow it.

To me the latest update absolutely feels like a different game entirely. It's like the developers saw what Subnautica Sub Zero did, and decided to try to cram that into their existing game. It doesn't fit. It's disjointed and jarring. It adds a level of difficulty and frustration to a game that did NOT call for it. The last areas are a different game, one I personally would not have bought.

If you DO like platforming, jumping puzzles, and boss fights - then this may still be a good game for you.  But I do not.

Before this update this game was a solid 8/10, maybe 9/10 for me. The newest areas are a 4/10 for me at best. So I guess I'm putting it away, incomplete, after over 170 hours of gameplay. I think I've returned to Raft for the last time."
7467, play it
7468, nbh
7469,"very good game,  its like everybody on the raft are africans, we stab eachother for water and scream at eachother like monkeys. would recommend"
7470,Right up next to 7 Days to Die in regards to a must-have survival game.
7471,Great laid back survival game. Fantastic graphics for what it is and a ton of replay value. Highly recommend to anyone who enjoys open world survival crafting games without too much stress!
7472,"interesting game but i easily got bored when playing alone, this game is basically made to play with friends"
7473,"Its great to jump in and make a splash with your mates!
Fun dynamic, awesome gaming experience. Was so cool seeing the dolphins but my mate told me to shut up so couldn't enjoy to its full extent."
7474,fun
7475,good
7476,9/10.
7477,Overhyped in my opinion. This game is pretty boring with constantly revolving impossible to solve threats. And do not even think of playing this alone. The balance just makes it 1000x as grindy playing alojne.
7478,Water
7479,When playing this game you completely lose track of time.

House building, survival & gathering, story.
It all just makes sense. 
100% would recommend.
At start it is a bit of a grind to get supplies but eventually it gets better."
7485,fun sandbox
7486,Love the game but its still very buggy
7487,"Raft is an awsome game, I wish i could say the same thing about the shark."
7488,"Raft has done the unthinkable, an open world survival crafting game leaving early access."
7489,greate game def worth the money (even in solo if u have no friends)...    also DONT TOUCH THE YELLOW ROUNDY FISH IT ISNT A STRESS BALL!
7490,"It's a really good game, especially in a team, after a long wait the update finally arrived, which is why my young brother and I couldn't continue for 1 year due to the lack of an update. 

I don't have to say much about the game itself, it's just important to have at least 2 friends or more, because it's not that exciting alone anymore, unless you collect enough materials and crafting alone, to survive the adventure with less loss

of course, it's worth taking breaks after several hours, because several hours of playing can become boring (tiring) at the same time"
7491,"I'm reviewing this after beating the main campaign with many hours in early access.

Pros:
beautiful atmosphere
unbelievably comfy 
simple yet interesting survival
crafting is simple yet interesting
details, details, details.
Overall pleasant experience.
------------------------------------------------------------------

Cons:
The progression is really strange.
crafting recipes come at the worst of times
story is forgettable and kinda meh
development seemed rather rushed considering the transition from early to final access.

So spoilers:

[spoiler]Why the fuck do you get titanium weapons after you beat the game? Why would I get those so late? sure if I got them an island after I got titanium but I have titanium weapons, which are incredible, when the game is over and I don't need them anymore? why?

These recipes are so fuckin' clueless. And the ending? that was pointless.[/spoiler]

overall, 7.9/10.
It's a wonderful game with questionable decisions. in development."
7492,It's a fun survival-type game with a bit of anxiety about the water with the shark love the thrill and the storyline; I would recommend it.
7493,This Game Is So Good
7494,I absolutely love survival games and Raft ranks way up on the list for me. The only thing i would change is the developers to make more chapters. I wish it didn't have to end. The re-play ability goes down a good bit once you have finished the story line. Still.... 10/10 would recommend
7495,"Very good but if you play alone it is borring
"
7496,more content pls
7497,Great game. Occasional bug or two (Bow breaking the UI and requiring a restart to fix) but no issues otherwise.

7524,Gud
7525,nerf shark
7526,This game very fun and decorating and building your raft over time can be very fun!
7527,Pretty fun game if you have friends who actually help you catch up to their gear instead of getting mad/annoyed when you ask questions on how to get the same stuff they have
7528,"Raft is a very relaxing game to start. it starts off slow with resources being a little hard to gather because you have to do it by hand but the music alone makes it somehow relaxing. it is repetitive but there's a joy that comes with expanding your raft and  finding islands that makes it worth while. the game has a story kind of and it's fun to discover what is out there. i recommend you give it a try for yourself. it has become a game i hold close to my heart. also, if you have friends to play with, BRING EM ALONG!! it'll make for a fun experience."
7529,I played for 5 hours and there was no help on how to play this game. Died over and over for 5+ hours and now I am done.

7540,"Please describe what you liked or disliked about this product:

Liked:- Watery theme, survival game play, balanced rate of progression, quests, side missions, and general activities, multi-player, and a whole host of other dynamics. A very well thought out production from an engaging team.

Disliked:- Breathing apparatus and flippers made of seaweed/goo lack durability. The effort and economics to collect for them and craft is a bit of a chore, unless you are the type of player who specialises in cooking up goo. A next level tier for these items would be useful to allow for more time until the next replacement and also for allowing more exploration in the depths.

...and whether you recommend it to others.
Yes

Please remember to be polite...
Have a pleasant sail."
7541,"Awesome awesome game. I have and will spend many many hours playing this.

I would love one more mode where there is no story (but not full creative). Just the random islands, and you find all the blueprints randomly on derelict rafts or something so you still have progression, but no raft/island play interruptions with the rats and forced exploration. Gives me anxiety. This mode would be the perfect blend of creativity and challenge in a survival setting.

Anyway, amazing work devs. 5 stars."
7542,"Fun survival game, with the necessary build element. The story line is short, but interesting and keeps you wanting to move forward to see what happens next. My only complaint is [spoiler] you don't get to kill the main villain. I've literally never wanted to kill someone more.[/spoiler] Other than that, there's plenty of open world exploration, and so many build/decor options that I can see potential for replay value. Here's hoping for more content in the future!"
7543,Nice casual game to play with friends for simple adventure
7544,They really need to debuff the hog
7545,"Great game, finished finally I hope. Maybe they continue to add to the game."
7546,nice game
7547,"Fantastic game! Could not recommend it enough! Scratches that itch that was left after finishing both Subnautica games! Just finished all the story line stuff and I am very much looking for more! There's very easily dozens and dozens of hours of real gameplay here! Something that the majority of AAA games can't do for you, an indie game like this sure will!"
7548,"This game starts out slow with lots of boring grinding, like me you probably dont like it
BUT the game really takes off and shines at the story islands, the best part for me is when you do  all these small little puzzles to slowly unravel the story of the island
8/10"

200% recomended."
7552,"fun to skip time
"
7553,"Amazing game.

This game is really fun to play both singleplayer and multiplayer.
I love the fact that the game doesn't rush you into the story like most games, it gives it a unique sense of ocean exploration that I adore. I have played a fair amount and just don't seem to get bored of it! I play a lot of multiplayer and most games of this style have buggy pretty or non-existent multiplayer, the multiplayer in this game is almost perfect and it exactly what I was looking for for an ocean exploration game. Overall a 10/10 game."
7554,"its good
"
7555,It's boring
7556,"This game is a perfect survival game with a good dose of creativity and story, without being too difficult to run on low spec PCs. The game ramps up at a good pace, letting you unlock more advanced recipes either through coasting through the ocean or reaching story milestone locations.
 
I've been playing on Normal difficulty and it's a decent grind to upkeep the essentials even in late game, but not impossible. Personally I would recommend players to try Easy difficulty as the game is difficult enough already and late game free's you up to explore some of the creative aspects like raft customization, decorations, and painting.

Highly recommend turning on seasickness mode, which locks your perspective to the raft versus to the horizon, as I found myself getting nauseous after a few hours of playing."
7557,it v good
7558,"not very good, grindy and confusing, concept is alright tho"
7559,"Amazing and relaxing game, played it during early access and finally got to play it again after full release. Will definitely play it again in the future for sure.
I'd also advise the devs to learn about game balance before making any further games 😎👍"
7560,its good
7561,"Game loop is incredibly grindy with little respect for that player. So many single-use items, expensive tools break very fast. You die of thirst or hunger within minutes...etc

As you ""tech up"" it doesn't get better, just grindier, and your busywork more abundant. Which breaks any satisfaction I might get from it."
7562,great game to play with your friends.
7563,"This game in the beginning is difficult especially by yourself. If you've ever played Don't Starve Together this game is very similar. Once you have enough supplies to expand the raft and start collection nets around, it gets easier to travel to where you need to go. Very fun game with a group of friends, highly recommend to those up for the challenge."
7564,Good
7565,This game is super fun to play with friends i have a lot of fun with it
7566,"I ain't even gonna lie, Chapter 1 and 2 had me wanting more and enjoying the game, the journey through Chapter 3 was pretty neat not gonna lie, but then the ending... the ending is so dogshit and basic, like hooray we saved everyone, uptopia is still a shit show and there is only 8 people left in the world. Filled with incest to repopulate the shitty flooded world of florida. 
4/10 after the final chapter came out. Don't get it unless you wanna be disappointed with a happy ending. 


let me nuke the world instead."

7572,This is a very fun game. it is easy to play with friends and family.
7573,u can make big boat go fast

7578,Too much bug keep reset my inventory!
7579,good game to play with friends
7580,story sucks but game is fun
7581,"Funny Game to Raft with friend, or even solo. How ever it would be better if you put some music for background just like minecraft. The second thing to improve is connection and auto save.
When I play in the first game with friend through a lot of progresses and hours.
There the game just kick-me-off and that is the real bad experience. And you don't want this to bother anyplayer's experience, right?
The last thing is make some event in the ocean just like wrecked-ship or chase by pirate.
I'm experience in this game 3-4 hours."
7582,"Interesting concept, a fun play!"
7583,"Survival games are one of my favorite genres, and I'm glad to have this one as an option to come back to in the future. Extremely fun all around. The story islands especially are great to explore and the progression of finding new blueprints is always satisfying."
7584,Very fun and entertaining even for someone who doesn't normally play survival games.
7585,eh..Its ok
7586,Better than you would think. Good Game

7597,"I really like this game, even if you don't try to make like a super fleet of a raft with the sole purpose of progress and instead just make fancy ass stuff while not dying or getting eaten as side struggle you can still have the  best f'n time"
7598,"One of the best multiplayer survival, building and story games. We had fun, challenging and also calm times in here. Building your own raft from four panels to survival mansion deluxe, it felt like building a home and you kinda get attached to it. PS: Team Bruce!"

7608,Beautiful game with a unique twist on the survival builder. The developers have been great throughout the entire early access period and it's definitely worth a buy.
7609,"Good game to play with you friends, But it would be awesome if they added Coop online servers searching to the game"
7610,Boat
7611,I enjoyed it but definitely is an anger pushing game.
7612,"I bought this game very early on, I enjoyed the base game play and had fun with it in early access and now.
The problem is the story, and a few balance decisions leave a bad taste....... the early stuff before this last chapter kinda worked out and doesn't trip many annoyance flags, but the last few locations, story, and boss fight all feel like something to just get it done and finished and a chance to shout ""the MAN=bad"". One of the animations for an attack for the last boss is so bad(think 5 nights at freddy's animatronics motions on what is supposed to be a live animal????) I felt like closing the game right then and there(especially after watching the last boss jump down to my level by ""popping up, sliding forward, and dropping down"" with basically no model animation , and the writing was TERRIBLE (I know writing good story is hard, but this is just ""the MAN=bad"", silly drivel often used by irrational people use to explain why they don't get ahead when their own decisions lead them to the place they stand. Silly drivel usually makes a bad storyline for anyone smart enough not to drown themselves in it.)
The LOW durability of the tools is very annoying and DRAAAAAGGGGS the grind out horribly(drove me to modding the game by the time I got to Tangaroa)
Mango and Coconut seeds drop at ~60% to ~75%, meaning your tree farm will dwindle rather quickly, Not dropping the seed and having an option to harvest the seed from the fruit would have dropped the unnecessary grind.

At the end, you will have to load mods if you don't enjoy the grind (didn't know this was an MMO living off of my playtime....) for materials JUST to keep up on tool durability, (building the raft takes quite a bit too, and don't build raft parts in the wrong place.... you lose half taking it back down) 

Spoiler time?:
A platforming section in a game that hangs the character up on little details of the walls and terrain?? also the HUGE delay between crouching and change in the character hitbox??? WTF Maybe a small delay but not several seconds. 
TITANIUM TOOLS at the END!!!!!!!!!!!!!!???????????????????? you made me grind so much for materials to keep my metal tools going in the first place I have explored everything to boredom ALREADY... REALLY!!!??? At the end the only thing left to do is mess with your raft......"
7613,"play it with a hot girl

7625,e
7626,Very fun game I recomend playing with friends though
7627,"I build raft then get harassed by the entity known as ""shark"" but really if you don't have bait then it is no longer a sea creature but a monster of all types which took me away from my family and stole my dog until it eventually destroys my raft with all my effort gone to waste because i did not have enough plastic to repair it."
7628,The wife and I play it on easy. Probs play it on normal with more people! Love the atmosphere. It's our wind down/chill game.
7629,This game is very funny and addictive! very little glitches and not boring!
7630,good
7631,"This is a super great game to play with friends, It's a little lonely on your own. I've been with it since it's early access and the developers are really active and care a lot about their community.

For just 20$ this game is an absolute STEAL. I love playing with friends because we can pretty quickly fall into our rolls - the Chef, the Homemaker, the explorer, the Diver. There's something here for everybody. You and some friends can pick this up and have a blast in multiplayer.

10 / 10 would stab a seagull again."
7632,"I rarely leave reviews but... This is absolutely one of the worst games I've ever played.

Stiff, stilted, half-arsed story with some of the worst VA's I've ever heard. The game has tried and failed to go beyond ""Build a raft and try not to die"" with janky map exploration, completely un-telegraphed puzzles, superfluous time wasting (run around and do X with no hints) and a combat system that feels like it was thrown in at the last minute, as an incomplete after thought.

It's a spear. Not a dagger. They have *reach*

The perfect example of unnecessary time-wasting is the death mechanic. You lose most of your inventory and that which you keep loses most of its condition.

Another perfect example of unnecessary time-wasting is by wearing down worn gear. Not axes and hooks, but flippers, oxygen tanks, even leather armour (which is pointless.) By itself, degrading gear is a standard survival mechanic... but in raft, items deteriorate exponentially fast.

As you come towards the end of the story, the narrative feels increasingly contrived and weirdly flagellant, stretched out with countless time wasting mechanics that add nothing to the game. Everything from cutting vines to the jumping puzzles appears just to exist to give the illusion of playing a game that simply isn't.

Take Guild Wars 2's jumping puzzles. They are in my humble opinion, amazing. Not even the final jumping puzzle is within shooting distance of the worst jumping puzzle of FF, GW2, WOW, etc. 

I don't expect to be knocked off my feet. I also don't expect to have blatant time wasting rubbed in my face.


On a final note: Imagine dying of first and deciding that, instead of moving as fast as you can to get to your drink (because the freshwater river isn't *drinkable*) your character decides to be 'exhausted' in a fashion that conveniently makes it very easy to be killed, thus losing 2/3rds items, which need to be re-gathered.

There's a reason why hard games worth their salt all give you the chance to recover your stuff.

Because they don't need to waste your time.

7633,Very fun to play with friends
7634,cool
7635,"this game is actually really good. it has good story, good gameplay, runs well on most pc.

I have watched people play this game in the past, Thankfully I didn't see much so that I could play the game for myself! and enjoy the game play! really wish there were more options so that I could increase my FPS, so I'll give it a 8/10, the game play is good, just kinda wish there were some more setting to increase FPS."

must play with a friend"
7656,"Highly recommend, I first got The Forest and that was super fun until you finish the game and learn where all the best loot is. This is a one up to that game as this game takes a lot more time to get comfortable and also is less repetitive in my eyes maybe due to the RNG of finding islands. Never feel like I'm bored when playing this game."

7711,good but It's game is too bugy
7712,"Alright.

From my short hours of playing Raft. I have noticed some serious flaws in it already.


Edit.
After playing more of Raft, it's actually pretty good, not gonna lie. All below is when I only had 1.5 hours but i was seriously into it non stop. But if you start in easy mode, you can find yourself getting used to how Raft is and becoming good at it.

I changed this review to positive as it's actually pretty fun, the hunger thing becomes rewarding once you have a nice supply of food

The sharks are rewarding when you kill them as you get a nice amount of Flake :)

Durability of items is correct, I will cross out number 3 below because if the durability of the items were longer, it would become way too easy.

Raft isn't that repetitive if you play it longer enough as you always come by something new or different, or different challenges through out a storm or wanting to get to an island.

But number 5, I still stand by it but not enough to make it a negative review. The islands are still very much empty, if they could add randomly generated islands and have different things to do on the island, that would INSTANTLY make the game more fun, knowing that the next island will be the same as the previous one is kind of meh. 


















1. Hunger. Food is super easy to get, and that's just by fishing and gathering meats, berries, pineapples, watermelons etc. But that's not the problem. It's the upkeep of the hunger that is annoying as you are consistently needing to eat food, and I can even see the bar go down every 3 seconds of ""Walking"" which is a pretty weak survival mechanic.

2. Sharks. The shark, never, goes, away. No matter how far you go, or in what spot you end up at, the shark is always there. Now that's the purpose of deep waters but the shark doesn't swim away for 3 minutes then come back, it's pretty much always in your line of sight, so if your boat was floating away 10 metres from you, expect 2 nice bites out of you by the shark.

3. Durability. Now I find this one a big problem but it becomes annoying. For early beginners, (Like me), it is extremely difficult to come by materials for certain weapons, while of course maintaining the upkeep of your hunger becomes too annoying to even enjoy surviving, a buff on the durability would be fantastic.

4. VERY repetitive. Raft for me at least, becomes very repetitive, and I mean very very repetitive. The survival aspects in Raft are SO. BASIC. They have basically made a cartoon version of Stranded Deep and Subnautica but with extremely basic survival needs which is pretty weak for Axolot Games. Others may disagree but I reckon there needs to be more survival challenges then just sharks and hunger, as that's boring.

Lasty, number 5. Empty islands. There is 90% of islands in Raft that seem to be very empty and no interactions to do, now this is a survival game and went with a realistic survival game by not adding additional interactions to islands (Besides stores), I reckon there could be way more resources and interactions with the surface of the islands to give more of a depth of you actually being on an island.

This game is mixed for me as what really annoys me the most is the upkeep of hunger, and like I said, food isn't hard to get, it's actually pretty damn well easy to get, but having to keep eating by running around the island once is very unrealistic if they are going for realism/cartoon style to this game."
7713,"The game is very in depth and has a very charming art style. The survival aspect is fun if you just want to focus on that, but there is also a story to the game that you can follow to gain a deeper understanding. It is very fun to play alone or with friends and I would recommend it to anyone looking for a new game."
7714,decent

P/S: Get this game"
7730,"This game has gone out of Early Access but it still feels like Early Access. There are so many small QoL improvements needed in this game. So many small things make you roll your eyes and go ""is this a full release?"" Like the simple fact that you have to eat the equivalent of a full family meal several times per day to not starve. You find a new big place to explore, you better have tons of meat and water on you if you want to explore it.
That being said, it's not a bad game and deserves a thumbs up for what it is and there are plenty of mods to help fix all of those small things needed to make it feel more feature complete.

That being said, times two, the story is truly nothing to write home about and you should get the game for the joy of building a fun Raft and just chilling. More than halfway through the story and getting through each big area should be interesting and adventurous but it just feels like a chore at this point. It looks interesting but with it being empty of life it feels like an incomplete map with missing features. All places are find X out of Y and bring them here, mission complete, onward to next island."
7731,"like game lot, fun good. shark gay"
7732,"I rate raft among the best survival games strictly for its survival mechanics and original concept. The early parts of the rely on a very weak combat system to get the player through key areas. It seems that the developers wised up a bit and focused on puzzle-oriented game in the final third of the game - which I feel aligns better with the feel of the game.

There are some hits and some misses with raft. Ultimately, the positives greatly outweigh the negatives. I feel that Redbeet did a great job wrapping up the game. I am very pleased with my purchase. Job well done team!"
7733,very under rated game and worth checking out. good fun with friends fun building and relaxing to play. story has some fun puzzles to solve
7734,"This is Waterworld!

A great game with friends, I hope for more story islands so the game will not be boring of repetitive tasks and mechanics."
7735,"Had an amazing time playing this with friends. Building and expanding our raft together all the while exploring and fighting dangerous creatures was pretty fun. We completed the game and we could keep playing if we wanted to, but there really isn't much left to do once you finish the story unless you're the completionist/collector or achievement hunter type or you just really want to turn your raft into a floating city.

There actually are mods for this game that can make things interesting to say the least. Would only recommend using them after you complete it, though. One I use gives me a special hat made only for the devs and a god tier weapon that one hits everything."
7736,its alright but gets pretty boring
7737,i am addicted
7738,"An extremely fun and unique game, not to mention an early access that followed through. Thanks devs!"

7745,"Was fun with GF, also screw bruce."
7746,yes
7747,great with friends
7748,pretty fun to just sit back and relax... a little chaos when playing with friends but otherwise pretty fun
7749,its a pretty good sandbox
7750,"learning curve can be a little bit rough, but once you get a grasp on it it's a good time. Story is solid, some of the enemies you come across are brutal. some items have an annoyingly low durability, but that's a pretty minor problem in my opinion. good with friends, fun to build in, a lovely number of options for painting things and a great number of paintings/decorations, some location specific. it's becoming my second minecraft."
7751,yes
7752,"All in all it is a lot of fun for what you pay for. If you don't rush the story line, you can get dozens of hours out of the game. Only down side is there are a couple of annoying parkour points in the game (especially the windmill one on the last stop of the last chapter) that block you from moving forward. But, if you enjoy punishing platformers then this will be a piece a cake for you."
7753,good
7754,you get into a rhythm. You can follow the story line or you can sail the open seas. Your choice.
7755,"I love the game.  Its a little difficult in the beginning but once you've learned the mechanic its not so bad.  Shark attacking your boat is pretty annoying.  But, say you have a 5x5 raft just armor the outside platforms and BOOM no more having to lose tiles because the shark wont attack the tiles that are in the center because the outside is armored.  Combat is easy, besides the birds.  Not the seagulls, the ones that drop rocks on you.  Takes for ever to kill and you have to use a bow.  Well probably easier to kill if you dont use stone arrows, but who's gonna waste the metal on metal arrows or even titanium.  The building aspect of the game is phenomenal, other than the gathering resources.  Playing on normal and building a yacht is taking for ever but I am having fun doing it.  Story was great and hope for more, although there might not be any.   Long story short I love this game."
7756,Fun chill games. Pretty stress free. Throw on some tunes and get rafting!
7757,asame
7758,"Great fun with friends, on a second run through to finish the final chapter. It takes a bit of learning to master the tricks (spearing the shark for instance), and combat can be a tad clunky, but a great story and fantastic kid friendly fun! The building component is fantastic, 9/10 would recommend."
7759,boring after 3 minutes (doesn't get better)
7760,As long as you don't play on a PC equivalent to a Samsung smart fridge its really fun!
7761,"Low stress survival, good crafting and build system.  Great for playing with kids."
7762,"I highly recommend buying this game for people that are considering it!
It's fun both solo and with friends! 
It has a decent storyline, but building the raft is the most fun IMO :D"

7768,"THEY RUINED IT WITH THE END!!!!!!

This game is 95% PHENOMENAL and I would have recommended it to anyone at the first mention of it's name. I even purchased a second copy for my son to play it with me now that it's full release. I absolutely love everything about it. The setting is nice, the story is good, the grinding isn't bad and the decorative options are nice. How much food and water you have to consume is ridiculously high and my 5 year old daughter can hold her breath longer than the protagonist, but I still loved it. Then... 

They completely lose all of my support with the last section. Without spoilers they took a game about crafting and exploration and took a wrong way left turn at Mirror's Edge drive, adding a very unforgiving parkour section while their 1st person movement... isn't great. They then sought salvation in the Legend of Zelda parking garage to finish it all. Combat is also really not a strength in this game. In the end everything started to feel phoned in once I hit the newer content. I'm very sad that such a good game came crashing down. Get it on deep discount."

Have fun,"" And for Pete's sake, watch out for sharks."""

It's glitchy all around, has terribly designed progression, annoying mechanics and limitations. The entire experience is a turnoff from itself. If you're playing by yourself an didn't abandon the game on the first hour (Which is probably the only remotely fun part), you likely will after that. Playing with friends, the fun had nothing to do with the game but with the fact that I was with my friends. Any game can be good like that."

7823,good game with good story and fun to play with others
7824,"I really enjoyed this game, the open ocean to explore and free roam while also surviving and exploring the story-line is always something nice to have, especially with your online friends. My only issue, is unlocking all the good gear, equipment, tools, and such so close to the end of the story. Yes I do enjoy the Advanced items that help make things so much easier on ones raft, but a little pointless when some of them are so close to the end of the story to where once you get them, you just have to do continue a little then boom, end of the story line. Don't get me wrong I LOVE this game! just wish that the story line continued a little further so we could get full use of these new items before beating the game and probably move to another game to play with my friends. Other than that, 10/10 would recommend."

Completed the story with a party of my friends and it was awesome to say the least. Just the right amount of story to keep you engaged as you start learning how every character you encounter is intertwined. I really hope this game continues to develop and grow. I will be here waiting for more and I will pull my party together for every new update. More content and more stories please. I am very curious about how much more we can learn about this world.

7876,"Raft is an excellent survival open world game with a simple premise. You are stranded in the middle of the ocean on a tiny wooden platform and a hook, and the only way to survive is to scavenge the polluted waters for resources to craft items and improve your raft to keep yourself alive and withstand the seafaring. As far as you know, the world is vast, empty and full of ocean except for a few small, lone islands. Slowly you start gathering resources and exploring the remnants of civilization to find out what has happened.

Building and designing your own raft is fun and you are free to do it exactly to your own liking. The game also encourages you to explore to gather resources, though the layouts of the islands and other locations will probably quickly become quite familiar. Gathering and managing your resources and taking care of your needs is usually fun and keeps you occupied with something all the time, but it can get quite tedious and grindy after a while. Getting 100% achievements especially requires a lot grinding, but gladly that is optional.

In addition to its great crafting and survival mechanics, Raft has an exciting storyline told mostly through subtle environmental clues. The puzzles and layout somewhat remind me of escape room games and horror stories. Some of the locations were among the greatest levels I had seen in games, and I much enjoyed playing them. You will only need to pick up and locate some radio signals to get the story started.

The game is especially fun when played in multi-player mode, but is a great experience in a single-world playthrough too.

Unless you get hooked to the game immediately or intend to get 100% achievements, this game probably holds attention for a few dozen hours. Still, I would consider those hours not wasted at all."

7901,"Fun and chill game, with a lot of crafting and Bruce. The storyline has a lot of nifty little challenges and riddles. Would love to see even more of this."
7902,fun
7903,"This game was super fun with friends but ultimately at the end it left this kind of unfinished emptiness, like we didn't get to do what we originally we're trying to accomplish and it left a sour taste in my mouth after finishing"
7904,shark spoopy
7905,Very fun game! 9/10 Doctors recommend
7906,"A really solid 30-50 experience if you want to build something special. If you rush through the story islands you'll probably be done in 10-15 hours though. Like any survival game you'll have a lot more fun if you take your time, build what you want and focus on having a steady supply of resources rather than just pushing through the story. I actually feel the story islands were the weakest part of the game, some were fun and interesting (mostly the first few) but later the game becomes a bit of a puzzle game, which is only a problem because it's in such contrast from the rest of the game. 8/10: the story was only JUST deep enough to make you play through to the end but the thrill of slowly expanding and building upon your raft is truly a great feeling."

7922,yes
7923,This is a fun raft-building survival and crafting game.  I didn't care for the end game as it devolved into a lot of jumping puzzles (gross).  Some elements are irritating (shark) but you adapt to it and ends up being just part of the environment.

7934,"This was bought for me.... I love these types of games... I don't get the appeal. I find this game so boring even during two player. The Shark is annoying, the building is clunky, the resource gathering is tedious, the islands all feel samey. Yeah... Don't get it at all... I really suggest you don't buy it.

7994,"Decent game with a shit save system. I understand save on death, but still think it should be optional. However, this game goes beyond that and saves over every previous save file as well for that world. So if you haven't saved in an hour, die to whatever, and think that you'd rather just go back to that previous save, you can't. The devs have pretty much said ""well not saving on death isn't realistic, and this is a survival game, so oh well."" Ya, neither is building a mansion on water using a forest worth of palm leaves and rotten wood, but we let it slide."
7995,More fun than I expected.

And playing alone is no different from this. I recommend this game for people that need games to play with groups or alone!
8018,So happy so have seen this game all the way from early access to full release. I like that you can take it at your own pace if you're not ready to pursue the story instantly. Fun to play with friends and fun to play alone.

8053,"[h1]I had a bunch of fun with this game.
It is well worth its asking price and by far the best survival/crafting game out there![/h1]

That said it feels not very fair to criticize so much about it, but it is absolutely justified to do so because:

[b]There is so much wrong with this game![/b]

[spoiler]-there is no reason for weapons and tools to break! The building hammer doesn't break so why does the hook or even worse: the oxygen bottle? That's just annoying![/spoiler]
[spoiler]-why do you get the best weapon recipes AFTER you played through the story. There is literally nothing more to do and to use them for at that point![/spoiler]
[spoiler]-why do you have to make a new bucket everytime you milk a goat? At least give the player 3 or 4 buckets per receipe like with clay bowls![/spoiler]
[spoiler]-everything should be usable with the recycler![/spoiler]
[spoiler]-the advanced grill and the electric grill are pretty much useless after you have a cooking pot![/spoiler]
[spoiler]-it is so annyoing that the main source for scrap are reefs! Scrap later gets very important to build bigger rafts. [/spoiler]
[spoiler]-why do the recipes not depend on the progress of the story. You can find absolutely wortheless recipes you found already 5 times! Even if you are already on Utopia![/spoiler]
[spoiler]-SOME objects do have an advanced version but many others don't! There is so much inconsistency here! Also why are there no titan versions for all tools?[/spoiler]
[spoiler]-why are there so many resources that have just ONE purpose??? Like dirt, giant clams or dry bricks?[/spoiler]
[spoiler]-the raft is the most important thing in this game, still you have just a handful decorations! Additionally you get a bunch of beautiful decorations in utopia after there is no real reason to play the game anymore and to decorate anything![/spoiler]
[spoiler]-3 biomes and every biome has just about 3 to 5 different islands? It does not take long to have seen them all. There need to be much more of them. Give your players things to discover even while they are not on a story island![/spoiler]

[b]The whole game feels like a good early access version that needs 3 or 4 BIG content patches and a bunch of quality testing to reach version 1.0![/b]

Still as i said: I had a bunch of fun playing this game coop!
So here is hope that there will be a Raft 2 in some years that profits from all the knowledge the team has gathered while developing this game!

[h1]In any case: Good work Redbeet Interactive! Getting out of early access with such a solid game is not easy and also not very common!
I'm looking forward to play more games from you![/h1]"
8054,Its really good. You should try it but it can involve some grinding.
8055,A truly great game
8056,"its an interesting take on an survival adventure, if your looking to have some fun with your friends or take on the waters on your own then this game might just be for you"
8057,Quite fun even though my pc can't run the graphics well at all. It's so fun that I just push through my terrible frames for the joy of stabbing a shark in the head repeatedly.

8075,Overall a great survival game. Fun to play as both solo or with friends.
8076,"I love the adventure, the graphics and sounds of the open sea, and the survival aspect of The Raft. However, a training scenario would have been lovely at the start. I died multiple times just trying to figure out how to swim, catch items, use items, even to make and drink fresh water. Online aids from other players were integral. Also, better controller integration in-game would be so amazing. For example, seeing ""Press O"" instead of ""JOYSTICK BUTTON CONFIG 2"" when adapting the controller to computer. Much of this was frustratingly trial and error, but it was worth it. However a shark attack every 5 minutes is a bit predictable and too fast. Random, longer spurts of attacks would be good for future versions."

8086,good
8087,Love this game. The final chapter update is one of my favorite updates!!!
8088,"I'm a big fan of survival games, and this game after 150 hours has become one of my all time favorites.  The fact that your base travels with you adds a unique element, plus the underlying story is thoughtful and well executed.  I honestly had my expectations far exceeded by this game and what it has to offer in the story missions and locations, and just the general game mechanics.

I've played many hours of this both in single and multiplayer and all I can say is that if the developers offer DLC I will be the first to buy."
8089,I played with a racist and it was still fun
8090,"I thought I would enjoy this, but honestly EVERYTHING feels like a chore like every single thing in the game just feels like a cumbersome chore and none of it any fun.  Then when you finally get somewhere you end up dying in one of the 6,000 ways you can die and boom most of what you are carrying is lost and you have to remake all your gear again which will mean another 4 hours grinding for stuff.  Honestly you have better ways to spend your time than play this thing."

8100,"Such a lovely experience, was watching it in early access eager for more. They developed it with a lovely story via the notes and audio clips with quirky characters. A great resource and building game where you get to see what surviving on the open ocean would be like with great gadgets to keep you alive and sustained until you build up enough to start thriving. Love the atmosphere and the different areas you get to explore. A nice and relaxing game about resource management and a simple love of the ocean.

you spend time a lot in water 
i really advice you to learn how to swim before you get game
i was swimming and a shark bit me i thought its an swimming simulator. i don't understand why there would be sharks in this game. but survived him (the shark).
after all i give this game a 8/10 
(do not buy if you don't like sharks especially gay sharks)"
8106,SAIKOU NO GAME
8107,chill game bro. good fun with friends!
8108,"I liked it [b]a lot[/b]. It was fun to progress the Raft itself with more and more stuff. For my taste, there could have been even more progress - maybe even something to program, further automatise. I would have also liked there to be more variety in the kinds of island you could find - even tho a lot of progress has been made here compared to earlier builds. 

If you are looking for a casual scenic adventure, where you have time to explore and find new things, go for Raft!"

8140,Shark bait ooh ahh ahh!!
8141,ITs good
8142,"I like a lot of the beginning, expanding your raft, exploring whatever islands you would drift to and the first couple of story islands. Most of my time was creating and detailing a large raft and it was fun, especially after installing the engines and the steering wheel. However, a lot of the later story islands (Balboa and after) felt unnecessarily confusing. The islands were either small points of interest scattered through out a large area (like Balboa, or Temperance) , or a small area densely packed with building, rafts, or trailers (Caravan island). The manners to progress were mostly straight forward, but I found myself annoyed with running long distances, or missing necessary items. 

On Balboa island, I was annoyed with running between all the radio towers and the ranger station. Running between all until I found something tangible and many of the times being told to turn around and look else where; say with the radio tower blocked by vegetation, or the empty board of tools in the ranger station. On Caravan Island, there are numerous crevasses to explore and the game rewards the player for finding them, cool. However, some of theses crevasses had necessary items such as cables for the battery charger. The thought of having to meticulously explore every trailer, in which some were only reachable by zip line across the island, was daunting and disorientating. Overall the islands were decent (Tangaroa being the only one to peak my interest), some of them just needed to be less cryptic with item placement and express the player's position with notable landmarks when a map is given.    

The ""boss"" fight felt weird, especially the second encounter with Olof and his hyenas. My first though was this is a battle of attrition, kill the hyenas. After wasting my time, I eventually realized I had to build up a wall. I did, but I got caught by a hyena, pulled to the ground in an disorientating perspective shift, escaped, and pulled down again by another hyena before I could recuperate; iterating until I died. Frustrated by the loss of 2/3 of not just my items but also tool durability, I sourly ended my time with this game. I was unmotivated to grind for more materials to rebuild the tools that had been destroyed/damaged, scavenge for more fruit and meat to remake all the food taken from me, and then fight that group of janky hyenas again. I enjoy being well prepared, so I lost a lot. With all the tedium I already experienced, why would I bother putting myself back in the meat grinder after dying so close to the ending (at least I presume given the escalating tension and Utopia being the last story island).   

Perhaps I should not have played solo, and maybe I am perceptively dumb. However, I was always conflicted when the game allowed me to leave my raft. I wanted the items/tech to expand and build the U.S.S. PINCHE GRINGO, but was bummed over the occasional cryptic and tedious moments, since when they happened they would really drag on for me."
8143,.
8144,Epic game if you playin with the homies. Especially when you delete the world after being 10 hours deep.
8145,i love game as call raft  it cool right

I have not tried playing it solo together, and learning without any real guide, did make my first time playing with someone, was a bit of a train wreck, but it was FUN. 

I've continued playing, learning how to survive and improve, and have been enjoying every moment of it so far.
Would highly recommend, especially in a co-op environment!"

8161,yo
8162," I will murder that shark over and over and over again until my hands are throbbing from the wooden stick I use to poke it over and over and over again.  This shark will follow me to my watery grave where we will be in water hell together and we will be immortal there and we will hate each other for the rest of eternity.  I will collect his head over and over again and I will keep putting the hat on every time, wearing my last victim as I murder the next so they think I'm one of them when I'm really not. I will slowly gain their trust as they fill their bellies with my wood, slowly letting them become comfortable and fat so that when I collect their juicy heads they will be plump and delicious.  I only eat shark, I will starve until the next shark is ready for the next kill.  I only have a thirst for shark now."

More like not daft

Edit: Raft more like can't fucking play the game without getting a black screen and breaking my whole entire computer every five minutes and then if by some luck that doesn't happen you get stuck by some a unblocked area that soft locks you. I even have the recommended specs. All in all if your PC is BETTER than the specs and you can run it without a black screen it is a fun game"

8184,I appreciate the Peaceful and creative game modes much more than I thought I would. After playing the initial Normal mode and checking to see HOW HARD hard could be. I decided to take a step back and just play peaceful mode. Its a staggeringly relaxing experience. With the presence of the challenge of survival mixed in 8.5/10
8185,this game is so much fun but my friend needs power wash plz tell him to stop
8186,Its been a whole day on this game and haven't even explored all of the land.
8187,"Raft is simply one of the most charming survival games I’ve played. Simply standing on my raft as it floats over the waves through an endless body of water is truly relaxing. There’s also a great sense of pride and achievement that comes with seeing what I’ve built every time I load into the game. It’s an easy recommendation for survival fans that may have been holding off on jumping into early access, as well as those just learning about the game for the first time."

8243,"I gotta say this final boss fight is so tedious that after waiting for so long for this chapter, only to find out it is the final one, has lowered my ""recommend"" to ""only if you really love the way building your raft works."" I'm literally in the middle of it. I stopped to type this review.
Maybe the multiplayer is more fun than single. Too bad I don't have any interested friends. I'm close to finishing the game, but I don't know if I'll ever play it again after finishing the ultimately disappointing story. Sadly I'm thinking ""is it worth it to grind for X resource, or should I just do something less frustrating and possibly more entertaining like watching paint dry."" I have spent hours drifting along, dutifully upgrading my raft, painting the walls, collecting resources and hoping for a new adventure on the horizon. Maybe I've just spent too much time doing that. The random islands don't feel very random. The fight mechanic is all jab and jump back, and my raft never stops feeling like something built out of Zaks (remember those? look it up on wikipedia) no matter how many vending machine potted plants I place or pixelated paintings decorate my walls. The level design is mediocre and when it isn't abundantly obvious what to do, I find myself glancing at a walkthru instead of exploring because the set dressing is so much copy and paste of the same basic elements that if I'm not constantly thinking of the lore there really isn't anything to do or look at.
I wish I didn't feel annoyed at the bombs being thrown at me or the mobs biting me. I wish I still felt invested. I wish it didn't feel one directional, and that there was anything else to this. Comparisons to Minecraft are inevitable and while the main story there didn't exactly get me either, at least I could make interesting contraptions with redstone. In Raft, I can enjoy the same pleasures I get in daily life like recharging batteries and remembering to drink enough water so I don't die."

8256,"This game was more frustrating than i wanted it to be. Tools break way to often, hunger and thirst drops way to quickly. Enemies are annoying to deal with. However the raft mechanics and the building and customization options were spot on. There are times where the game is fun but most of my experience is frustration. There is also some lack of polish in some areas which i'll explain in pros and cons in below.
Pros
+Raft Mechanics
+Building
Cons
-Lack of polish (example i need palm leafs. Too bad all the leafs on uncut-able trees and palm leafs on bushes can't help me here) (Another example; we need sand to make glass! Too bad i can't dig at the beach with my hands to get some sand and have to dive underwater and ""MINE"" the sand out.
-Questionable hit boxes. Some of the enemies hit boxes are questionable. For a spear you have to get right on top of them instead of having reach. Its the same range as using an axe or a machete or close enough to barley notice a difference.
-That Dam bird.. After awhile of dealing with him and knowing he leads his shots there are times i'll see the rock hit the ground 3 meters from me and I still take full damage. His rocks can also ping you when you are underwater in the ocean however; your rocks that you throw at shark break on water surface. One final thing about the bird is hit hitbox. I've had arrows bounce off his body multiple times. In order to hit the bird it has to be a head shot only or the air in front of said bird when i should have missed.
-Tool durability and resource cost. I need 4 plastic to make a cup to drink out of; didn't i just pull in a plastic bottle floating in the ocean? Oh, it only gave me 1 plastic.
-Made a paddle out of 6 plastic 4 rope and 4 wood. Breaks in no time, either our characters suck at crafting, or that is some very weak rope.

Overall if you power through it the game does get more enjoyable. Just hope the developers make some more polish to the game."

8269,"HARD
"
8270,"this game is really fun if you have a fun friend group, otherwise it's a bit of a slog with a few egregious bugs and decisions for a game that's out of early access. to name a few:

-running is SLIGHTLY faster than walking
-seagulls are buggy (i've had many float off my raft after being killed, they phase through walls to get your crops, and once i had one get stuck in a death animation between my raft and the waters)
-items you drop can sometimes phase through the raft itself
-scrap hook isn't coded well. if an underwater collectible item (like scrap, rocks, sand, etc.) is high enough on the shore where you can stand instead of swim, you will not be able to mine it, only throw your hook at it. you have to be swimming to mine.
-enemies can phase through geometry. i've had the shark bite me through the raft, as well as screechers phasing through mountains to hit me, and their rocks being dropped on me despite me being under cover
-audio bugs; the ocean noises cut out suddenly once, and you can sometimes hear players collecting water even if you are not close to the raft.
-(personal annoyance #1) bird nest, despite being a bird nest with eggs in it, is a way for you to reliably get meat and feathers. before update 9 in 2019 you used to get eggs from seagulls as well, but with update 9 came 'cluckers', which are chickens that you only get eggs from. the sprite has not been changed to reflect this.
-(personal annoyance #2) the new characters you can play as are unlocked by going to story islands, even though these are just player characters with little to no lore."

8288,"Played for a bit before immediately asking for a refund. The experience was just bad from a ""game"" standpoint.

Wasn't getting the right resources necessary for survival, found an island, got stuck in island's rocks, spent 15 minutes trying to get resources necessary for a paddle, finally burned two paddles getting off island, died of hunger - lost hook, rest of tools reduced to shit durability, let shark eat me...

This game is shit for solo - don't bother without another stooge to pick up the busy work ""fun""."
8289,Truly one of the most boring games we have ever played. We (3 people in total) bought the game blind because of the insanely positive reviews. One of the biggest problems is there is 0 exploration since 95% of the game is just on your raft. Once in a while you get to an island with the big highlight that you can chop a tree or 2 or kill a boar. Absolutely mind-boggling how this could be interesting to some people. I rarely write any reviews but please please please stay away from this game.

8299,"Fun game to play, soothing scenery mixed with the dangers of survival in the wild. I did quickly however get a little bored after 12 Hrs of gameplay as things just became a bit stale and repetitive."
8300,"loved the game it was a blast, there is always something to do and work on or work towards even when playing with friends there is still always something to do. I really like how the game progresses, at the start is all survival-focused but as you get better stuff for your raft it's it still doesn't make things super easy and keeps the game engaging all the way through to the end. 
The story was great fun and the puzzles are challenging but doable, the online community is one of the friendliest game communities I've seen. 
It's a really good game, very generously priced I would recommend."
8301,Great game for coop
8302,"Sharks bite my boat every now and then. Fun game for about 5 hours, There is friendly fire!"
8303,fun
8304,"Neat game. survival/crafting element mixed with a storyline.

Fight are simple overall. Boss are done with some specific location related mechanic to spice things up.
Survival part of it is ... well weird in a way. Health is easy to manage - you get it back easily over time and can use consumable to boost your regen, yes if you do multiple misstake you will die.
Thirst is not super relevant - early it's just at the cost of a few plank (boiling water), then it's at 0 cost outside of inventory slot.
As for food you can either fish (quite a waste of time imo), gather (pickup, cut tree ...), or have crops. The last option is really easy to expand on and get a massive amount of food in a short amount of time (you need some materials but its cheap).
The weird part is that food (depending on specific item) reduce a different amount of thirst/hunger if you are thirsty or hungry. It's up to double the value. And any overeating is lost; so if you try to keep your bar full you will easily consume 100-150% more than if you only eat/drink when super low (kinda why people complain it's hard, when they are wasting a lot).
Later you can make new food but it's never worth it because of the high cost, high requirement, multiple ingredient, and give nothing but more time before you need to eat/drink again. Or just eat potatoes when you are low and keep a stack with you, you will be fine.

The building system is fine, you get new toy as you progress and can get quite creative with them.

Crafting system is simple and part of it require interaction instead of just using a menu (you smelt thing by manually placing ore and plank in the furnace for example), making it less boring. 

Having animals spice thing up a bit and add another layer, even if they aren't super important they play a part and keep me engaged.

Exploration is tied to ressources gathering, and what island you find depend on your receiver setting (it's somewhat progression based). Whatever code you choose can let different kind of island appear so as you progress in the story you can spot new regular island.
Kinda annoying that you can't just have all type of island spawn at any moment once you unlock them tho.

As for the story, it's ok. the VA make it hard to understand what they say often because of their strong accent and overacting but it's fine, it add character. The lore isn't much explained tho and the major story sound plain dumb and not making sense near the end.
You can progress trough it when you want and even stop midway a part of the story and come back later (building have specific escape path for you to cut the walking distance).

It's overall a very good game that mesh quite a lot of little neat thing together. It's probably best experienced with some friends but can be played fine alone.
there is unnofficial mods that are up to date and add fun things (electrical connection, QOL, new gear, etc).

There is some minor issue tho, like titanium balance (looks like titanium is balanced only for long term player), the last story location can quickly be frustating for some people (jumping). You are given good blueprint once you complete the story making them irrelevant for a decent amount of people  That give a bad feeling when the player end the game.
I'm not a game dev but if you look around player are usually given ""something"" before a hard boss that can be used against him, not right after with no bigger threat to use them. That make it even worse.
While it's minor its the last thing a lot of player playing up to the story will see. You'd want the start and the end of a game done in the best way possible."
8305,"Well, two friends and I waited until the release version to finally play this game. Initially, we had a lot of fun. Many fun mechanics that fit in to the game theme and make it fun. However, as we progressed the cracks started to form. Story spoilers ahead.

My main issue with this game, is that it just doesn't feel finished. Many ways to cheese the puzzles and just keeping up with thirst and hunger was a bit of an issue. In the end, we had to always appoint one of us to manage crops and meat, one person was always navigating and looking for islands while the last emptied nets and crafted upgrades. Also... WHO HAD THE BRIGHT IDEA TO MAKE GLASS JARS AND CLAY BOWLS SINGLE USE?!!? This seems like a cheap way to keep old resources relevant. Having different containers only be able to store certain things feels wrong.
When exploring story locations, it would have been nice to find more rare items and maybe even food items, instead of just more and more scrap/ other items you find floating on the ocean. Exploring feels boring and unrewarding.
My last issue is with the final boss fight. I feel like there should have been an interesting mechanic, like we had with the Megalodon fight. But no, all you do is slash away and wait for his health to go to 0. After finishing the story, you unlock the final tier of tools. What good is that now? The game is done, there is nothing left to do or find so I have no motivation to gather the resources needed. I think it would have been much better to have these tools going in to the final fight."

8310,It good
8311,This game is fun up until you go to the story locations. They sometimes have neat puzzles but most of the time its just straight up busy work. Between walking managing food and looking for things the story areas are just doggy doo. Most of the time on the story locations I just sat around doing nothing until we got to a puzzle.
8312,"This game is fun until you get to any of the story locations, instantly becomes the most unfun walking simulator. While exploring these expansive areas, you still need to manage your food and water. Also, in multiplayer, if someone gets downed, the only way to revive them is for them to go back to the ship. Why can you not revive them anywhere? It completely kills the flow of the gameplay and becomes a huge chore for everyone. They should have stopped developing once they made the raft mechanics.

4/10

8392,"A fun game at great value - dollars spent versus overall game hours. The game play interface is intuitive for the most part. I particularly enjoyed expanding my raft. Always plenty of things to do, even just ensuring enough freshwater and food for the long voyages. The world interactions are quite limited with very few items to interact with but this also makes finding the things you need to do less onerous and time-wasting. If you like survival and construction-type games this game is well worth adding to your libray for $25 or less."
8393,"I am a 45 yo father, probably one of the oldest people playing this game. I am a single farther to my Son, who is 14 now. My son got this game for Christmas in 2021 from his uncle, so we installed it on his computer and he started playing. By the end of the week he had 24 hours on this game. This was horrible for me, as it was already hard for me to find ways to spend time with my son, as he is always out with his friends or just watching YouTube. So I decided to make a Steam account and get this game to see if I could maybe play alongside him. I loaded into the game, picked my character and started playing but I was stuck on what you where supposed to do. I asked my Son for help and he hosted a game for me to join. I loved it as it was the best time I had spent with my Son since my wife had died. This game has ever since brought me and my son closer again and now we actually spend time together outside the house together as well. This game reminded me that there's fun to be had in everything, and it has brought both me and my Son many happy memories."

Other recommendations welcome (mobile craftible base with first person decorations not just customising gun port 2 with cannon type Delta - Like mid - lategame Subnautica when you can get the submarine base and do basic decorations in it)


The shipbuilding, or I should say the raft building, is the best part of this game, even though I suspect the entire framework and model library is something they purchased for the engine because I've seen the same objects used in cash grab ripoffs for crafting types.

-1.0 points for the thin, VERY thin story. I know they dumbed down the game story to make it accessible to kids (no mention of peoples deaths, just sicknesses), but they had ample places to write better backstory and notes (ala system shock and a hundred other games). Not being a fan of voice acting, I would have made the additional lore just be text logs.

-0.5 for decoration items - don't get me wrong, they have a good selection of trophy items to decorate with, but there are so many moddded items that are stock game model items that could help add even more decorating options for the raft. I mean, you have an entire abandoned city filled with modern furniture that you should be able to loot for your craft.

Is it worth the $20? Absolutely. If someone could mod in the plot and Smokers from Waterworld this game would be 10/10."
8403,raft is fun :)
8404,very noice
8405,"good
"
8406,Glitchy boring game
8407,this game is an amazing open world survival game you have to try it if want somthing fun and new to try
8408,Amazing game!
8409,nice
8410,"Went from a game I love to a game I fucking hate. Jesus, always online if one thing, but the progression hold back for a game that keeps you in basically one spot now is some of the worst designed gameplay I have ever seen in a long while. branching out to just be able to enjoy the game is stunted to the point of high hell if you die. Stone is a huge hold back, and the fact you cant pick it up off an island main shore, rather you have to swim for it? Have you ever been on an Island? stones of any use are not in the water, they get eroded by water, also clay.. in salt water come on.... also why cant you just pick up the plants like any normal game."
8411,"I played during early access and really enjoyed the premise of the game; especially with friends.

I decided to wait and play during full release, which I whole-heartedly regret. The game is overall just extremely grindy, the story and objectives are plain and repetitive, leading up to an anti-climatic boss fight + ending.

I can't really recommend this game to anyone looking forward to a well thought-out adventure. To plainly sum it up, it's an ""open-water"" survival game with trivial scavenger hunt tasks; you gather supplies while on your boat, reach your destination, find items, then head to another area. Rinse and repeat."
8412,yes its very fun to play
8413,"It's just a good game, plus new update is great
"
8414,"Physics engine not working, we lost our time. This game was listed as a full game not an alpha but the physics bugs make the game inplayable. Your boat can pass trough mountains.

Still in alpha."
8415,Awesome!!
8416,"-Bad combat, 
-Very grindy, 
-For the majority of time you will go to islands, collect shit, deal with shark, repeat,
-in early access for years and still just 3-4 Tiers of equipment (wood,iron,titan)
-fuck Balboa island, acctualy fuck all of those islands. It's sooo fun backtracking for a 20 times with speed of a snail to pick up a fcking shovel, machete or some other bullshit. 
-progression suck balls, not only you have to scan items at the table, but also progress story, which isn't anything remotly interesting, but also walk at snail's speed around big islands that have nothing in there except like one or two blueprints.1

Maybe you can mod this to be fun but i lost all the interest in playing this game. Never again."
8417,"Raft is Life
"
8418,"It's fun to explore the islands and reefs, and to discover stuff to do with materials in the research table. I appreciate the various difficulties, too: I can play with different groups of friends, or by myself, with slightly different degrees of challenge depending on the mood. Haven't gotten round to checking out the story, yet. The game sure keeps you busy: there is always stuff you NEED to do to survive or to improve the raft and living conditions. I am curious to see how long I stick with it... but I really want to build my meagre wooden platform into a pretty floating castle. xD"
8419,oh my goodness my friends and I have never laughed so hard in our lives as we tried to survive on our new raft home. XD this is a fantastic game and would HIGHLY recommend.
8420,good  game and u can get mods
8421,Great game!
8422,"Definitely the survival game with the most frustrating gameplay out there. Those birds that drop stones at you can easily get the most annoying design of the millennium award if there was one.
Would much rather play either Valheim, V Rising or Stranded Deep for the same price and actually have fun."
8423,"This game has a ton of potential to be really fun, but constantly gets in its own way. There doesn't seem to be much effort put into quality of life.. managing inventory is very tedious, no way to quickly sort your inventory from your person to chest. There is Bruce the shark who attacks your raft constantly. And I mean CONSTANTLY. Its way over the top to the point of just being obnoxious. You have to eat more food in a day than I eat in an entire week just to not starve to death... water needs to be drank every few minutes just to not die of thirst...and they make common building supplies a total pain in the ass to get constantly. Even the ways that are ""easier"" are a pain in the ass. OH and the game literally glitched out one of our engines. It was on my friends screen and not mine, and then we reloaded in and it was just gone despite knowing for a fact the shark didnt eat it. 

What the game gets right is the story you follow, finding new things on bigger islands, and the progression of gear seems to be good. That is, if it weren't for supplies all being a pain to gather. But there are a lot of cool items to help you progress and the boat building is a lot of fun and also well done. Tons of decorative items to add to the boat.

I love survival games, but on this one I just felt like our group could never get anything done outside of making food, drinking water, fighting off the shark, and rebuilding stuff that the shark ate. It started off fun and quickly just became super annoying to play. I feel like just a little more thought about quality of life stuff for the players would make this game much more enjoyable. Like I said, a lot of things in place in the game got us excited to play. But then you spend 2 hours just trying to fix your boat from shark attacks and fishing for food... Playing other survival games where I'm only eating and drinking a few times per day brings tears of joy to my eyes after playing this game. And having a shark attack is a fun idea but having it attack as frequent as it does isnt a fun challenge at all. It quickly becomes obnoxious. If the games on sale maybe try it? But looking back on the game I felt like I was just annoyed most of the time despite there being a lot of potential in this game. A few updates would probably help this game out a ton IMO."
8424,"Though this game too forever to get put of BETA, it's a decent game and I would recommend it if you like ocean survival."
8425,good game
8426,h
8427,Beware of Bruce!
8428,"Exploring is so great in this game and theres a very nice learning curve once you understand the basics. Playing with friends is also really nice since people can jump in and out with very little restriction. 

High recommend."
8429,"This game is a great mix of relaxing and pure stress.  Great game to just jump in a voice chat with friends and have a good time.  You will go from being utterly helpless to having a cool raft with useful additions as you progress through the story.  Eventually you won't even be scared to just hop in the water and 1v1 the shark.  (...and if you're me, you'll still lose the fight because your timing sucks.)"
8430,great survival multiplayer game I recommend it to survival liking and creative players
8431,"I found this game to be quite engaging once you get past the initial survival bit. The one thing I would suggest is to make missions clearer as at times, without looking things up on the internet, they can be a little confusing.
Solid 8/10 rating."
8432,"The game is not what it was in the beginning and has expanded on a lot of quality of life and gameplay improvements. It is still Raft at the core but with all the new features added in, I would recommend playing or coming back to the game if already purchased. And bring some friends with you too, it is a lot of fun with other players."
8433,it is fun too play with my family and friends
8434,"This game started out as a sandbox game without any story. I often speculated how these game producers would continue the game, and also develop some sort of story in this lonely game. Well, they've done it. Since this games early release, the creators have worked hard to complete this game and deliver incredible content for their early investors. I highly recommend this masterpiece, COMPLETE game!!"
8435,"This game is well worth the price its like minecraft on the water.  It does have a great twist to it and I love the story line.  It also gives you a relaxing feeling when going across the water with your friends.  This game really made me start to miss my younger ages when I wasnt looking for cartoony games I was looking for more realistic games that are like milsim, this just made me happy to play and felt weirdly nostalgic highly recommend."
8436,I recommend it to everone. it's so enjoyable
8437,"This is an example of EA done right, I followed the game all through development and when it was released I bought it and have loved playing the story line. The time at review is how long it took me to complete the story line, I took my time in between each location, sailed for a while and looted islands, added to the raft. I have no doubt you could complete it much faster if you wanted to, but where is the fun in that? 
If you want a straight sand box experience, you can do that although the good blue prints are locked behind story line quests, it would be nice for those who just want to cruise the ocean to unlock them once and not have to do it through every play through, however this is a very minor complaint. If you like survival games you should love this game, it ticks all the boxes."
8438,"Fun game, mmmmmmmm salmon"
8439,"It gets more fun once you start to understand it, the game is even better with friends."
8440,Minecraft but wet
8441,"I am a 45 yo father, probably one of the oldest people playing this game. I am a single farther to my Son, who is 14 now. My son got this game for Christmas from his uncle, so we installed it on his computer and he started playing. By the end of the week he had 24 hours on this game. This was horrible for me, as it was already hard for me to find ways to spend time with my son, as he is always out with his friends or just, watching YouTube. So i decided to make a Steam account and get this game to see if I could maybe play alongside him. loaded into the game, made my character and world and started playing but I was stuck on what you where supposed to do. I asked my Son for help and he hosted a game for me to join. loved it as it was the best time had spent with my Son since my wife had died. This game has ever since brought me and my son closer again and now we actually spend time together outside the house together as well. This game reminded me that there's fun to be had in everything, and it has brought both me and my Son many happy memories."
8442,god
8443,Very good game!
8444,"trash is your best friend, sharks are your worst enemy."
8445,"1.0 IS HERE!  Game is well done for a survival game. Early game there is a decent learning curve and I had to restart a few times once I  realized a few mistakes I made. Example I ran out of wood and was starving and didn't have any raw food to eat as I was busy building raft instead of getting every piece of wood/barrel i saw.  Or upgrading to fast and running out of key resources and you get stuck not being able to craft weapons.  Overall such an enjoyable game. Well worth the money and time so far. Plan on playing for a long while. The dev team does seem to be active and updating game so looking forward to what comes next. 

Downsides are audio crackles/cuts out now and again but only very rarely for me. Slightly bigger issue is it can be computer intensive (code doesn't seem optimized).  My computer I built is a beast and runs it fine, but it is under MUCH more of a load than what I feel it should be, and after reading others talk about it seems this may be the case. Make sure your GPU is cooled or air flow is decent in case, and set CPU to 90 or 95% max threshold to keep things smooth.  This has fixed so many crash issues and heat issues related to un-optimized games.  I now just leave it at 95% max now. Goto Control Panel\Hardware and Sound\Power Options\Edit Plan Settings and click change advanced power settings and then set max cpu to 95%. Seems to keep my CPU hot spot much lower and in the clear on all my games over the years.

Anyway if on the fence like I was get the game it is easily worth the money if you like survival games at any level.  See you on the water, and keep on rafting on!"
8446,good game very fun definetly in my top three best games
8447,a fun game that doesnt take up much space i would play this game if u need good games that take up a little storage
8448,"It was updated all those years and all it become is this? Animations are canky, optimization is non-existent, content is without logic."
8449,pluck my curly pubes with a sythe on a rope
8450,"To be honest, I had a lot of fun playing this. However, despite being called ""raft"", I spent most of my time on an islands, yes there's a lot of activity on the raft, but I still ends up exploring island, sail away, farm for a bit, build for a bit, and then explore island and this goes on repeat.

Also, a bit of spoiler... (for the radio tower)




In this game, most of the world is underwater. A HUGE missed chance for undersea exploration and better diving gear....."
8451,Fun with friends
8452,I hate birds.
8453,so worth it!
8454,We need an option to change the shark into a gawr gura skin
8455,its fun and addicting like minecraft with a story. I'm having fun collecting resources and hope the game continues making content past chapter 3.
8456,"It's a good game, if you like survival games, creativity games, and/or ocean based games, this might be for you!"

8459,game is fun if you don't mind the grind
8460,"Personally, I think this game is amazing, from the sound-track, to the enemies, to the developers who worked hard on updating this awesome survival game, the art-style fits this game greatly, but isn't too distracting. Although, I encountered something that baffles me. I saved a world right next to an underwater chest. I also quit the world and joined back. The baffling part to me is whenever I'd collect the underwater chest, I would be teleported back to my raft. This game isn't bad because of this issue, It's just something I don't understand. If anyone knows about this issue, then comment on this review."
8461,ye
8462,"who doesn`t love spending some time with their friends, if you do i very very recommending this game for multiplayer, the vibe building raft from square to a massive ship and enjoying the story from radio tower till utopia, i just... love it."
8463,"i mean yeah its pretty cool, sick shark, cool hook, coop is fun too ig, lore is ight"
8464,"I have played this game since its initial release back in 2019. Now a lot of people complain that there is some bugs but honestly that's what makes this game just feel thrown together to have some fun. At its cores its just grabbing junk out the ocean to make a raft but along the way a fun story to discover. The bugs I have encountered have only made me laugh more along the way. From fishing, exploring, sailing the seas there is something for everyone to enjoy in the endless see full of Brucees hungry for some rafters."
8465,Always wanted pepper corns
8466,Death to all sharks.
8467,good
8468,me lik
8469,"Overall this game is barely playable and can get boring very fast. Made with Unity and that shows (which is a bad thing), alternatively could say that the game is very unpolished.

The only reason I could play through it was due to the Co-op and raft building, which is probably the best feature of this ""game"".

Combat is very sour and boring, like coffee. O_Q"
8470,I'm bad at survival games but having a great time with this.
8471,"Things you can kill in Raft:
✔️Birds
✔️Sharks
✔️Bears
✔️Rats
✔️Warthogs
✔️Pufferfish
✔️Pigs
✔️Bigger Bird
✔️Bigger Shark
✔️Bigger Bear
✔️Robots
❌Llamas
❌Chickens
❌Goats
❌Bees

I didn't build a raft. I built a pirate ship and lived out my shanty fantasy. 

9/10. Would recommend all the time."
8472,"This is one of my all time favourite games for many reasons. Survival can be very time consuming but strangely addicting. The 8 destinations all have something unique about them, which makes it feel special. I recommend playing this with friends as it can be very humorous and more enjoyable with friends (I know from experience). Creative is also very fun (especially with friends) as it allows you to focus on building your raft without worries of health, hunger and thirst. It can also lead into roleplaying, teamwork and overall, a very chilled out experience. Survival's story is very interesting and easy to follow along. It also has so much you can do which means you will likely continue playing on your raft even after finishing the story. Overall, this is a fantastic game i urge you to play with your friends."
8473,i fun
8474,very addicting
8475,great raft mechanics and raft building. absolutely awful story with the most boring and disappointing ending. getting materials for raft/item building is also very tedious.
8476,VERY FUN when playing with friends i love the story line not many bugs at all but one warning watch out when you click q on accident it drops the item in your hand and i have had many lost items cause of that XD
8477,"Absolutely worth the price. You can still have fun playing it solo, but it`s always better with friends."
8478,"It starts off a little boring but once you get going its a brilliant survival game
"
8479,fish
8480,Рекомендую
8481,Game is fun with friends. It's fun to scream because the hostile creatures are coming after you and your friends are laughing because of the fact. The story line is very fun to follow and cant wait to finish the game :)
8482,4
8483,fun
8484,"A great game surely, despite the sea sickness, I had great times playing with friends"
8485,haha shark go brrrrrrr
8486,I played a bit with friend the game was not as i expected its was a bit empty for us and when we found an island we realized enemies have lock on attacks that was even worse so that was another reason we refunded the game.
8487,amazing game

8490,this game is probably the best 20 buck game out there. it has tons of exploring and fun puzzles for you and your friends! i played this game for a few weeks straight. its very addicting.
8491,good
8492,the shark gobbled me up :( 10/2
8493,great survival game with fun mechanics
8494,very fun to play with friends
8495,"Really enjoyable chilled game. Only have a few hours so far but I'm really liking it.

My only gripe would be the worlds being locked to an individual. I play with a few friends and if i'm not online, they can't continue the same world because I'm the host. Game state could in theory be quite easily saved to the cloud, not sure why this was overlooked.

Oh, I also hate the puffer fish taking 80% of your health - either reduce their damage or make it more obvious when they're approaching.

"
8496,good
8497,Nice slow paced and calm game to play alone or to chill with friends.
8498,makes me fell black
8499,gud game
8500,"Finally the full game is here and i played from start to finish.
I had such a great time it was really enjoyable but there was some bugs for me. The worst bug was at the end.
The last bossfight the audio and voice started glitching the game crashed 5 times but even after restarting
the audio and everything was still messed up."
8501,Guud
8502,Really fun to play with friends ! :)
8503,Really good. Good with friends. Shark=Stupid
8504,"Very fun and relaxing, some frustration with my boy Bruce the shark but you can take it out on him.  I think this hits the fun + challenging threshold just perfectly.  Haven't played with any mods yet, would hope if they mods are good QOL that they could be added to the game at base.

Very fun helping friends with their rafts and with friends come shenanigans.  Good game!"
8505,"fun game, enjoyed it alot"
8506,"Would you recommend this game to other players?

Yes.

"
8507,good
8508,I want to be able to load a previous save after a death. piss on this game
8509,castaways ahoy
8510,Fun immersive and can lost in gameplay for hours But Shark is Gae
8511,Good game
8512,shark good
8513,"Had my eyes on this game for a long time as I love the survival-crafting genre, and a friend and I decided to get the game as it finally full released. The game has been a good bit of fun, and I would recommend it, especially for the price. The game is good. It's just not great. There are so many small bugs and quality of life issues that just make no sense to me, and the game definitely feels like it's in beta. But it's not, not anymore. Unsure if the devs are going to continue updating, but as it stands it just feels unfinished. Again, if you enjoy the genre, I recommend the game. The story isn't amazing but it's interesting.  I'd give Raft 7/10."
8514,"This game captures a lot of great parts for what it's trying to be and It's an early access done right. They had a vision for what they wanted the game to become, we got content, a story and best of all a fun experience."
8515,ohhhh this game will suck you in Immediatly!! its absolutey fun!!!!!!!!! i sunk in 7 hours in my first run
8516,Funnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnn
8517,pog
8518,"I can't believe this was only $20! Raft hooked me right from the start, pun not intented. 7/10 game! Bring your friends!"
8519,Nice
8520,the fealing of surviving the gruling fate of the ocian is one that none can compare you must survive eating your own poo and drinking your pee. you must live on the shark that huntes you as you umpregnate it with your spear. you thrive off of the death of the inocint- i mean islands.
8521,"Great game if you have friends. 

I like my game mode hard and my red beets raw."
8522,"If you're looking for another open-world survival game that scratches the same itch that Subnautica did, Raft is the game for you. Customize your raft as you travel a post-apocalyptic world where the ice caps have melted and the only remnants of land are the peaks of former mountains and skyscrapers. Follow the story-driven locations to track down the last hub of humanity as you battle both land animals and sea creatures on your journey.

Having played this game in early access, the developers did well to add quality-of-life features and expand the worldbuillding of Raft via notes in each story location. However, the direction of the game changed dramatically upon its commercial release where note collection was pared down significantly and boss battles suddenly became a part of the game. The last 3 story locations lack the spirit of the previous updates and it's a rather disappointing change to what was once a wonderfully crafted game about separation and solitude from cultural centers of humanity. Despite the downgrades in worldbuilding, the game at its core is still an enjoyable experience for survival enthusiasts."
8523,goog dame
8524,"When I first started this game, I was so excited and I called up some friends and we collected a ton of materials. We didn't really know much about the game, until we found out about scuba diving and smelting. We got to the radio tower, but the tide was not in our favor and we thought we were softlocked. We created another world and beat the game. This game is AMAZING, and anyone that says differently is selling something. This game is definetely worth more than 20$."

8528,amazing story fun with friends
8529,not fun at beginning until u get gud
8530,I like the simple and addictive gameplay. Perfect mix of survival and building!
8531,"I enjoyed this game a lot more than I thought I would. It can be harsh and unforgiving in the early game but that soon changes. The exploration and creativity in building your raft is great. I have only a few criticisms which are really nit picking. Like a good book, when you finish it you're a bit sad that there's nothing more, but I guess that's how you know it's good."
8532,"Great Game, updated frequently and they always add cool items to change your game up a bit
"
8533,lots of fun
8534,gud game kinda weird physics with wave but a
8535,"This game is so much fun to play and explore with friends. It doesn't take itself too seriously, but isn't a cakewalk either."
8536,it's really fun especially with friends. : )
8537,its fun
8538,"I know people will fight me on this. But the process of gameplay from start to finish is weird so hear me out. So basically you start on a small raft and have to gather resources yes of course! But as you go along you must struggle to improve the raft and gain more momentum so the struggle becomes less. Great so far! Ok so the issue that makes me lost on gameplay or directive is this, the basic blueprints like, sprinklers,purifier,engine,charger,pipes,biofuel,beehives are all behind the story points of interest. So during most of the game you are set to the basic primitive struggle items with  no means to refine the materials to further the raft. So most people have a horribly built raft with basic needs for food/water/storage only to hold out for the normal item blueprints set to the story. So you mostly are set to speedrun/rush for the storyline and skip out on the slow roleplay run. Why build a primitive base before the blueprints to fit the base. Once you have all those things for that raft and can finally build a proper raft...the game is over, no more story, nothing to work for, so why contiune? Sure many will say just relax and play the game slow and not rush the story...but you HAVE TO for the basic blueprints. Why go to big not story islands for materials you cant really use. They should had the blueprints be random where if you travel to large islands you could find 1 useful blueprint. Which incentives  exploration away from the storyline thus making the gameplay last longer. Aright so then if they change that why would you need the stroyline, well you could have even higher end stuff like the titanium gear and more roleplay build/items, extra cool things that wont affect early gameplay . Like Minecraft where yes you could stop at diamond gear, but with some hard work and grinding you can get nether stuff which is way better then diamond. IDk the game is great but I hate how the momentum dies the second you finish the story."

8541,Fun game we are on day 8 and still having fun
8542,Good game. Raft is fun to play with friends but when you are all alone and no one can play with you it just gets boring so only get friends or siblings on to play with you.
8543,Yes. Comfy game.
8544,i like ti eat the shark

8546,meh

8552,"Fuck this shit, I have 30 hours sunk into this game, 6 from trying to play it after ""The Final Update"" dropped. I cannot get in without their stupid fucking CrAsH hAnDLer fucking shutting down my game. I've seen tons of people with the same issue and no one tries to help them. RedBeet heres a suggestion, Release a USEFUL Hotfix. 
Other than that, if you get lucky and can play it its fun by yourself but great playing with friends. I just cant believe I cant get a refund for a game I cant play."
8553,nao aguento mais
8554,"but my steam keeps having errors
"
8555,"One of the most frustrating games I have played. The first few hours are fine as you progress through the crafting tier (if not extremely grindy constantly getting the same food/water over and over), but eventually you have to craft a radar and antennae in order to find new and larger islands and it ends up being seemingly impossible to navigate to some of the new islands. My friend and I spent 2 hours constantly tweaking the sail to shift our direction ever so slightly, only for the island to never get closer. This game is extremely bugged, please don't waste your time. The developers wasted 7 hours of my life."
8556,Fun game to play with friends. Not to bad solo either
8557,"is good
"
8558,"Had a great time. Great w/ friends. 

Point taken away because of the bugs. 

9/10."
8559, you've gotta play with friends in order for it to be great. Its not the same when you are alone. 9.5/10
8560,too many french and asian people
8561,Fun
8562,"Oh, my God, what's that? - It's Bigger Jaws."
8563,This game has honestly become one of my favorite games for when I just want to relax. A friend and I have our own world and this game fits our dynamic perfectly. We always make sure to play consistently because it's something that we really enjoy together. We're already on the final chapter and I'm going to be pretty sad when we reach the end of our adventuring.
8564,You're gonna need a bigger boat.
8565,"very fun game, i love the story line and survival parts of this game. would recommend."
8566,"This game is amazing
"
8567,No controller support.
8568,yes
8569,"My son and I are back to play the new final chapter!! This is an excellent game! It was a bit strange at first, but that's just because it's a new concept. It's especially fun as a multiplayer co-op game. There is a lot to figure out and large areas to explore. You can build impressive rafts as you learn new crafting techniques. If you play survival mining games, you will probably enjoy this one."
8570,"Fun game, great story.
I hate to see that there will be no further story updates though."
8571,"Restarted three times and it's still fun, highly recommend"
8572,ADDICTING
8573,"This game has the perfect balance of leisure and panic. It's a bit chaotic in the beginning, but once you have a source of food and water, the rest is a pleasure to play."
8574,Potatoes
8575,"This game *excels* as a couples survival game. It's totally doable alone, and more than two would be fine, but if you've got a duo, I feel like it really shines. The gameplay loop is simple on paper, but before you know it, pulling in leaves, plastic, and planks, really spirals out of control into resource management, upgrades, and life-or-death struggles with the environment. 

And Bruce. 

F*ck Bruce.

But I digress, the most exciting part of most survival games is those early stages, and that's where you stay with Raft in a good way. Days in, we still have to keep an eye on things, we still need everything, and we're still intensely excited by the minute to minute. There's story quests we're pursuing, but the general gameplay has us so engrossed we haven't made much progress! My spouse and I are long time fans of Minecraft, Ark, Conan Exiles, and more in terms of Survival, and Raft has quickly taken over our gaming time."
8576,A VERY AMAZING GAME!! I love this game the ocean is relaxing the music is a peaceful great game if you just want to sit down and chill. Playing with friends is also very fun! You will get some good times and a few laughs! 11/10
8577,"Raft is survival crafting done right.

Exploration is fun, fast and rewarding. The blend of base building with character progression & expanding your means of navigating the world is polished, soundtrack is good, and the free updates since the start of Early Access have been pretty great overall.

Sure, the game can be a little rough around the edges at times. But that's par for the course in this genre, and you'll still find far more polish here than the average survival game by far. This is the way.

Wiki trivia: Bruce is apparently a female shark since the in-game model lacks claspers. Be careful looking that one up!"
8578,"I don't review games frequently, but I have a massive amount of appreciation for the game and developers as I have seen it grow over time. They do make the idea of being a drift as sea not boring as you are constantly trying to repair or build, or craft there always seems like there is somthing to do. That said, im not sure how replayability will be as some of the cooler items you do not get until the end. When the end finnly comes, it feels good, but its a end, after that is really is just a base builder, farm resources, make your raft look nice, and thats about it. Still, enjoyed it really well and put alot of time into it. If you like base builders with a little story, Raft as everything you can ask for, 9/10"
8579,IT IS ASOMEW
8580,Loved it but uninstalled on the final boss. Just terrible.

8590,its a great survival and adventure game there's lots to discover and many exciting challenges within the game.
8591,Literally one of my favourite games! I've played through it twice already and enjoyed every minute of it. My crew even gave each enemy a special name <3 Highly recommend giving it a go.
8592,Fun but hard
8593,bruce dead.
8594,"BEWARE - Addicting!

Very fun game in all honesty.  Easy to understand controls (for the most part), very fun graphic style.

Some specific items could be given a little bit of an update in regards to how exactly they're used.  Best example of this is the net launcher.  Ranged 'weapon' that is different from the bow, hook, etc.  It would be helpful to have a little game play animation that could be called upon before using incorrectly and loosing a very valuable tool that was made from hard to source materials."
8595,Fun with friends
8596,Amazing chaos with friends !
8597,AWFUL. WTF
8598,awe
8599,"Raft is kinda like Minecraft. Lot of fun with friends, and a little less fun if you're alone. However, I do like the concept, so I like it and would definitely recommend. :)"
8600,"I really like this game, not much I can think to complain about. I play with a friend, we did notice whoever is the world host has an easier time with the shark, the host can time an attack to avoid damage, player 2 has a much harder time. But I love the game."
8601,would not recommend
8602,"This is a really good game!  I don't remember being so immersed in a game on the outset.  Glued to it for three days straight!

Criticism:  
The biggest complaint I have is that there's no end game. There aren't a lot of crafting items, and when you complete the story you get the ability to craft the BEST few items and at that moment they make no difference.  At that point you can't no reason to go around collecting resources or exploring or doing anything despite now finally having the best tools for that.  

I suppose if you feel you want to overhaul your raft and lay it out differently you can still do that but you're just doing it for the sake of cosmetics, there's nothing left to play the game for which feels a bit like a lost opportunity considering now you could put these final items to good use, and the game loop is really addictive when there are things to do.  

The story/puzzles were not at all interesting to me but served to keep me exploring.  I don't think I listened to a single voiceover or read a single journal entry - that's not why I was playing the game.  They weren't the the way a lot though.

The combat is awful.  Thankfully it's not an important part of the game.

The islands were repetitive and uninteresting.  It seems like there are about 3 or 4 variants of small or big islands (aside from the story islands) but there wasn't much reason to go exploring other than for resource collection.  

Resource collection can be a bit weird.  You can walk around and pick up scrap on land but if that same scrap node is in 3 feet of water, you need a hook tool to pick it up.  There's dirt everywhere, but you can only dig up dirt nodes in caves.  Sand is everywhere but you can only collect it underwater and instead of using a shovel, you use a hook.  The hook (your main tool) functions just like a scoop except when you're actually using it as a hook, except when you're fishing - you don't use the hook at all.  Yeah it's a bid weird, thankfully not a big deal.

The food system was a bit tedious.  I wish eating/drinking things would provide bonuses rather than kill you if you didn't eat 14 meals a day.  A lot of the game is just figuring out a balance between keeping enough food/drink you anticipate you *might* need on an expedition (otherwise you'll die) vs. making space to carry back useful loot on mission islands, and I don't like to have to make that choice since I can't predict how long a story island might take to explore and how much water I need.

You unlock characters to play as the story goes on but it doesn't matter unless you play multiplayer I guess. 

Despite the criticism, all in all one of the better games I've played this year, great job!"
8603,final chapter was very disappointing.. waited 19 years for it to release just to be terrible. 10/10 would not recommend. peace.
8604,yes
8605,Good!. Enough said.

8611,I've been playing through Raft with a group of friends over the past week. It's an insanely fun exploration game. The uniqueness of your base being your mode of transportation is really nice and refreshing. Game would get a 10 out of 10 if the snow mobiles didn't drive like absolute garbage (this led to many stomach clenching laughs and a few ending up as vertical hut decorations). 9.99/10
8612,you can take your base where ever you go. it's a cool game. kinda rude though. killing you in shops. weird drift and glitches. fun.
8613,best worth the money
8614,"WARNING: Highly Addicting game...Binge played for 10 hours straight 3 days in a row. Playing on easy was a better decision though, just my recommendation."
8615,Darwin
8616,"Amazing game. You can perfectly play it by yourself, but gets even better with friends."
8617,GAAY
8618,"Very fun game, but a little short (unless you want to do all the grind Achievements.)
If you enjoy Valheim, but want something kind of similar to play while waiting for the next big update (but don't mind it lacking the depth of game play) then give Raft a try (mods are STRONGLY recommended.)"
8619,Okay Game. Maybe just not my genre tho. Is fun with friends. I liked building.
8620,it be good

8629,"I really enjoyed this game, but I am hopeful for updates, DC, expansions; something. 
I have had this game since early access release and have seen the game grow. With the announcement of the Final Chapter and full game release, it was time to play through with the guys. We beat it last night after spending roughly 22 hours, over the span of 2 weeks, playing and all of us were underwhelmed at the end. 100% because you just don't want the game to end, its too much fun to just end! This game has SO much potential and I really hope the developers have more in store for it. 
Overall the game is very addicting. Its a mix of chill, puzzle, and intermittent combat. I loved playing through all the islands and learning what happened through the story line. The customization of your raft was a blast too. Working together with friends to complete the game was a great way to bond.
I would highly recommend to fellow players, with the warning of abrupt ending. I would highly recommend to the developers to add more content. They have a game like no other; one that is Sim-esc, challenging with puzzles, customize-able... I think this game could be exactly what something like Sea of Thieves is lacking (minus the pirates). I believe adding more challenges or another story line would make this *Chefs kiss*. I would love to see more content similar to what happened in Utopia.
Overall, I give this game two thumbs up and will probably be replaying on hard mode."
8630,YESSSSSSSSSSSSSS!
8631,"The game is really good, when checking streams about it I can see why it's entertaining. But it didn't click with me, and here's why : 

I was playing it with a couple of friends, and after three hours of playtime we just realised that we hadn't advanced much, and that our experience was kinda ... boring. From what I've seen on streams and videos, the game gets crazy good in its later stages, but we ended up giving up because of how slow the beginning of our playthrough was. The items are rather scarce in the beginning, and because the shark bites the boat, the food meter goes down, etc ... you always have something to do. But then after a while you realised : oh, I've been doing kind of the same things for three hours. 

During those 3 hours, one was enjoyable (learning about the mechanics of the game, new stuff to build, islands to explore) and two were just filled with a whole lot of nothing, just fighting the shark when it comes for the raft, fishing, hooking stuff ... and after a while it just became obvious that the time we had wasn't ""bad"", but not good either, just really, really ""meh"", so we decided to stop.

I think the game is ok if you're willing to go through a rather boring (charming but still boring) beginning, I just don't know how long this ""slow part"" lasts, but if you're not absolutely sure that you'll like it, I would say pass on it. Me and my friends can't even refund the game, because it took us slightly too much time to realise that we were just not enjoying it, and that the good part was too far off."
8632,
8633,"good
"
8634,yes
8635,very good game!
8636,GOOD
8637,"I truly wish there was a Neutral review option. My tl;dr review is that you will have fun if you have 2+ friends to play with, but if you're trying to play solo, the game can feel incredibly toilous and tedious at times. Even at endgame, it is very hard to ever have enough resources to not feel like you're still doing tons of manual work. This could just be a negative bias on my part because I tend to enjoy factory style games where you can eventually automate everything. 

The story/progression are decent, the concept is unique and fun, and the puzzles are decent. 

[b]I would recommend on sale, and if you have at least one friend to play through it with. Also, if you're willing to be patient when you lose stuff early game to the Shark :P [/b]

"
8638,"Interesting idea with poor mechanics and boring systems. The annoyances I had in the first 3 hours never got better, and the only way I could enjoy playing this game at all was modding away many of the worst systems. 

Also - the game is confused on what it's trying to be. Is this a survival game where you craft bigger and better structures (Valheim, V Rising)? A punishingly difficult one where just surviving is the challenge (Frostpunk)? One with an interesting story to uncover? It fails at all of these equally - the survival systems require too much time investment to build anything of note (and the material costs are very high). It requires long periods of busywork to stay alive on Normal... so, it's difficult in that sense but not rewarding for doing it. And the story is not worth the time spent.

- Resource gathering just isn't tactile or fun. As a counterexample: I weirdly enjoy chopping down trees in Valheim. It's tactile and just feels kind of 'good'. V Rising's combat and movement is fun, so gathering resources is generally OK. Raft is none of these things - resource gathering (clearly part of the core gameplay loop in a survival game) is quite tedious. Throwing a hook, pulling it back, over and over and over is not fun. It feels like a class project for an computer science intro course. It really doesn't get much better once you have nets or better hooks either.
- Combat is brutal. Others have covered this, but if the shark is a core gameplay mechanic, it should not take several minutes of precisely timed attacks to kill it. The hitboxes are aweful, the game frequently skips frames when the shark is attacking (I assume they lock the game state to update the attack registration), it just makes it maddeningly annoying instead of a rewarding challenge. As a Dark Souls vet and lover I can confidently say this is not a skill gap issue but a poor implementation of combat.
- My first save got lost after two hours because I decided to go near an island that looked cool. It had a bird on it that killed me instantly. I respawned and was immediately killed again, losing my paddle. After a few attempts of making a run for it (impossible given the movement of the raft) I tried to load an old save - however, as my paddle was now gone, I could do nothing but drift repeatedly to my death. So, two hours lost to poor game design.  This happened in my other save and I just used mods to move my raft. IOW - the game will break your save occasionally through poor design.
"
8639,Very enjoyable game to play with friends.

8647,The game has been a joy to play. My partner and I have loved exploring the strangely polluted ocean and wondering why there weren't just water bottles floating around that we could use as... you know.... water bottles. But otherwise it was a really fun game. Well worth beating the story.

8655,Relaxing Fun Game. Can get a bit grindy throughout the game. Definitely better with more than one player. Still a really fun game.
8656,Fun to play with friends
8657,Raft is hands down the best survival game I've ever played. It is a very relaxing yet challenging experience and it was the first co op survival game I played with my friends. The story is captivating and yet the game never pressures you to pursue it if you don't feel like it. I could lose myself in this game forever. 11/10.

8660,"It's not the most visual stunning game but it never pretended to be, that being said the game play is nice and smooth 
(the occasional lag when a lot of equipment is running and you happen to stumble on a large island)

The survival system is split up in 3 nice and visible bars being Food | Water | Health
The large assortment of foods you are able to harvest from islands, and barrels floating around all have their own levels of nutritional values and once later in the game combining these into more nutritional meals really helps out once exploring the multiple bigger islands and story missions in the game

all with all it is a nice and chill game which I highly recommend to people that are looking for a nice chill and fun game to play with some friends.

8666,good game 8/10
8667,Good Game Especially when played with friends
8668,its fun but hard
8669,"I enjoyed this game with my friends for about 2 days. While fun at first, this game is filled with so much tedium we quickly got burned out. here are some examples.. 
-shark is constantly tearing apart the raft, not a big problem but gets annoying
-birds are constantly going after you crops, same issue really
-food and water bars decrease way to quick, it feels like I'm constantly having to eat
-most food sucks at filling up your hunger bar
-tools are weak and break too often
-tools cost too much to make for how little time you get to use them
-the battery dies too quick
-sometimes crops don't give you seeds back

These issues by themselves I can look past, but altogether are just killing the fun. When I'm not defending the raft from the shark and birds, I'm gorging myself on food and water. 
This game feels like chores... 5/10"
8670,"I love raft.  But I have to say the final chapter is more of a punishment than it is enjoyable.  The puzzles are tedious and at times even painfully dull, The islands lack enjoyment. And the story feels like it had to be finished in 5 minutes or else.     I dislike that you get the best tools and weapons AFTER you have finished the chapter.  Those tools and weapons could have been more useful going into the final island.   They have completely made a 180 on the game and made it a grind rather than a journey.   As it is now I can't recommend this game."

8686,Very chill game to play with your friends or significant other :) Played up until the point where the story reached at the time with 2 friends and we had fun exploring islands and upgrading out raft and equipment. We started playing again from the beginning as the big update came and added more content and basically added ending(?) to the story. Haven't gotten to the new content yet but we are excited to see and explore it as the time comes!

8711,"""Please describe what you liked or disliked about this game and whether you recommend it to others.""

Well I was just gonna drop a thumbs down and move on because... I don't like it...

What I disliked? I died of shark, I died of hunger I died of thirst, I died of not being able to build things because I was out of materials because I was building things to deal with the aforementioned instead of collecting shit.

Not too hard to figure out how to solve those in general but then what i have to start every game exactly the same building boilerplate basics?  Was this made by java devs or somerthing? No thanks. 
"
8712,yes
8713,"Outstanding game, Highly recommend"
8714,Funny game
8715,Please make more chapters! We are not satisfied with just 40 hours of games~ We want more! We want more! So much fun. It's addictive! With to try to survive and building. Graphic is cute. Loving it
8716,"i love this game , fun to spend time with Friends Or Alone One of those games where you blink and then you see it's been five hours  :D"
8717,fun
8718,"this ain't it chief 

-voice acting bad
-story stinky
-no incentive to upgrade most of the stuff on raft - can finish the game with basic tools and upgrades
-combat is horrible

This game shines at the beginning when the gameplay loop is fresh and it would shine if a player enjoys decking out their raft with all the upgrades and making it look impressive. 


"
8719,"The idea of the game is good, the implementation rather semi. Recommended if you don't value variety, as the game quickly becomes boring. 
At the beginning everything is fun, but soon it becomes clear: it's always the same. Sailing around to find an island (of which there are about 2 variants per biome per big/small island), hooking resources, killing shark, go on rafting.... 
Game is definitely better in multiplayer than in singleplayer, because then you can at least chat with others and the game world does not seem completely dead.
Also, the much praised relaxing atmosphere is quickly lost when every 5 minutes a shark attacks (which, by the way, also likes to glitche over your raft) or a seagull wants to eat away a crop.
The tools get destroyed and can't be repaired for less material. You can't even cut all kinds of trees you find, like ... ?!?
The developers have released an unfinished game here, which is sad.

All in all, the ocean in this game is the only thing that has depth."
8720,fuckimg shark. INFINITE SHARKS.
8721,"It's got a steep learning curve, and you have to figure a lot of things out, but I guess that tends to be the case with survival games a lot of the time.  It is fun and I think i will have more fun after I get the hang of...well.. surviving... XD."
8722,good
8723,"I've tried three times to get into Raft. I just can't do it. The hunger/thirst mete is too needy on normal, and death is too penalizing for solo. The creatures in the game are not well done mechanically. Everything seems like  chore. Instead of being immersed in a survival crafting game, I feel more like I'm playing Overcooked or Cook, Serve, Delicious. I could turn it to easy, but that's not the point. The ""normal"" experience is not good, and the game play is not my cup of tea."
8724,this is the best game to play with friends and enjoy
8725,I would not really recommend purchasing this game it gets boring after you beat the game
8726,its cool
8727,can't sex the rhino shark
8728,"Picked it up with two friends - had to restart repeatedly due to glitches and fail-states (like the raft being destroyed by a hyper-aggressive shark five minutes into the game while we were still learning the most basic crafting recipes and controls together), and seemingly being irreplaceable even though it's just a few planks of wood.

Had to continually google unexplained very basic features during the opening stages of a survival game under intense time-pressures - this is annoying if you can pause but it's game-breaking on a live multiplayer server.

Quickly reached the point of realising the game is just unfinished by ordinary standards and only tolerable to a community who've come to expect survival games to be incredibly janky.

We may have gotten unlucky with the number of bugs and problems we ran into around interaction, spawning, resource distribution etc, but we chose to refund before the hour was up.

I'd love to have a solid survival game based chiefly around sailing/drifting, but this isn't it - barebones, janky, and poorly presented to new players. If you're looking for the same, maybe some Valheim mods can/one day will offer the experience you're looking for."

8736,W gane
8737,"The game is hella fun until you reach the last area, Utopia. I'll just play till the end once and never again i'm going to go to there ever again.  That place is just a disappointment and full of frustration. what Utopia? i rather not see you again. that's the only area that make me rage so much. when i thought this game is just one peaceful game full of laugh and relaxing.

Recommended to buy, but not recommended to play till the end"
8738,many water much raft
8739,The games kinda water based and I get sea sick
8740,"I went in cold, and I'm really struggling to get into this.

You start unarmed on a tiny featureless raft, and a shark bites off a chunk every couple minutes. The game gives you no hints for what you're supposed to do about that.

The melee combat is completely numb. There's no indication that you're close enough to successfully land an attack with your pointy stick, so most times you miss on the first stab. There's no stagger or knockback behavior, so your only indication of a successful attack is sound. Good luck if you're single player; combat is clearly not balanced for that.

There doesn't seem to be any pragmatic reason to build a big raft or to put a structure on it - increased raft size just makes it take longer to react to shark or seagull attacks.

I'm five hours in, and so far it's just a bunch of grindy busywork keeping water and food bars full while floating between uninteresting islands. Minecraft on the open ocean, this is not.

I'll update my review if I find a let's play or a getting started guide that helps. The developer should probably provide these."
8741,"You don't need to experience the game.
It's not that deep or exciting. 
The performance isn't amazing (well, more accurately it uses unnecessarily high amounts of GPU). 

However, you might still very well be able to get +8 hours of genuine enjoyment out of it.
If it's on a reasonable discount and you really enjoy the idea of collecting trash while adrift, by all means get it. 
But it probably won't become a game within your top 150 favorite games."
8742,"good game would recommend
"
8743,Fun chill game to play co-op with a group of friends.
8744,"it is a fun game and it is a good way to past the time
"
8745,Great for mindless playing. Soothing blue sky and endless waves.
8746,"You get to be on a raft and do all the raft things. Like survive, explore the ocean, gather materials and build a fully self-sufficient raft paradise.

It’s a chill and easy going game – you have all the time in the world as you drift through an endless sea, looking for the next location to visit. There are a number of key locations to discover and explore with their own secrets and objectives. 

Crafting is pretty straight forward and there is a good sense of progression. You unlock most of the items very early on. There are a ton of decorative items so you really get to be creative with your raft build.

Overall, it’s a fairly relaxing and casual survival game. It is easy to get into and understand, especially for the “non gamers”. And it’s a great game for co-op, but very enjoyable as a solo too."
8747,water is wet and wood and leaves and research and islands and stuff like that
8748,"very fun game
:)"
8749,"Great Game, Fun when you grab couple of buddies and just chill on the ocean, the story is interesting, they recently just released another update and more story line is created, definitely pick this game up during a sale!"

8762,5/10 is not that good but is not bad either but what really hurts it a lot is the performance  and the feel that is still a prototype but maybe is because the character feels like the free UE5 character BP with a few tweaks

8771,"It was an enjoyable game. The part I liked the most was building on my raft and exploring islands. Toward the end of the game there are a lot of puzzles and parkour which I really don't like, but I pushed through to finish the game. Once I beat the game, there was nothing else to keep me going, so that was that. The story was done. There is no end game and it is a one play through type of game. 

Oh yea, that bow you get at first. Enjoy it, it is the only type of bow you find. Huge let down there. Also, once you get to chapter three, besides blue prints, you will see no new drops. Just story and blueprints. Kind of like they got to a point and decided to stop making items for the game. Like polar bears drop the exact same thing as brown bears. I expected white fur at least."
8772,"This was made with a very rare quality. Good mechanics, gameplay, story, not overwhelming but not boring. The puzzles are of an oldschool type. 

I do reccommend playing with a friend. Well worth 30$"
8773,Great Game- A truly great experience with friends a fulfilling long journey with great puzzles and pve mechanics enjoyed every part of this game

8781,"Great game and perfect to play with friends, there is no other game quite like it. keep up the good work."
8782,"I love this game. Not because it's perfect because there are flaws and a tediousness to it, but because I was so satisfied with what I got out of it. I have enjoyed my time on Raft and have awaited its completion. I've played games where I felt cheated but here, I felt every penny was earned. I only wish there was more."
8783,amazing
8784,"Good relaxing fun, way more entertaining than I expected. Water World meets Valheim"
8785,why do i need rope to sharpen a stick
8786,amazing game is very god
8787,Tons of fun.  Combat is pretty crap though.  Building a raft is a lot of fun and there is a great mod site with it's own mod loader to help round out the rough parts of the game that may or may not bother anyone.  This game has progression and a story that you can follow along.  The story islands explore mechanics in ways that refresh the game with puzzles that the otherwise chill floating on the ocean and building your raft doesn't.  I just hope the devs create some DLC for this with more story or more progression.
8788,"fun and entertaining, especially with friends!"
8789,One of the best survival games to play with your honey. Progression feels very satisfying. The music and aesthetics is pleasant.
8790,This game is so much fun
8791,w
8792,fun with friends
8793,It's fun
8794,Shark bait oooh ohhh  ahhhh
8795,"Overall, after an hundred of hours, I observed that ironically the game failed at both thing it was supposed to be, an exploration and building game.
Basically, the exploration is terribly limited since you are surrounded with nothing but water filled with sharks, to keep you on your raft. Besides, water surrounding you 100% of the time is empty, so no incentive to go there.
Raft failed miserably at exploiting what would have been it's BEST feature, large bodies of water.

Then you have some islands, which are tiny (even the bigger ones) and have nothing to offer that you cant already make or find on your raft (with the exception of 3 critters with their products that only need to be acquired once and a trading post). Each island instances have the some ""hidden"" caches always spawning at same places everytime, so you can easily hunt for the caches (full of stuff you can already make on your raft) without having to risk actually exploring once you set foot on a known island type.

For building aspects, the raft crafting as nice aesthetics, you just have to pick barrels and crates floating around to unlock them, no exploration needed! (*sigh*...)
It as a good mix of aesthetic objects, props, options to color every object and blocks but not enough techs and tools to make it an actual technically fun building game like Astroneer, Satisfactory, Starbound, etc.
Unlock a water purifier, then unlock a water purifier that can purify faster, then the modern one which can make it for bigger quantities. Makes a smelter, then make an advanced one that can smelt more, faster, you get the hang of it quite quickly: nothing changes really mechanic wise or motivates you to go up in the tech tree.

Story starts great then goes awfully goofy very fast. A handful of characters are met once or never, with a couple paragraphs of monologue, to unlock them as playable characters that you never see because it's 1st person anyway, giving poor support to the storyline and none on the interaction department.
I felt alone the whole time, even with online buddies in game. Bruce is your only companion, and hell he tries to kill you the whole game.

I think looking at that much water for so long got me depressed, but this game WILL give you the blues.

8805,One of the best games I played for a while.
8806,"I gave this game multiple tries, and I usually really enjoy these types of games, but there's just something about this game that doesn't click with me. Idk what it is but after 60+ hours over multiple different saves, I can say I didn't enjoy my time overall. I think maybe as a solo experience there are just better games out there and this is better suited for groups."
8807,This game is very addicting to play.
8808,"pretty fun with 4 players , by yourself not so much.."
8809,I love how the game is so creative and how you can do almost whatever you like. I also like how you can play with friends. One of the best games ever keep it up with the game.

8816,"One of the more chill survival games. PvE is at a minimum. Follow the story, explore, and build your raft."
8817,Did you know pneumonoultramicroscopicsilicovolcanoconiosis is the longest word in the urban dictionary
8818,"In an ocean of survival* games, Raft is one of the finest fish to ever swim.

*It's an extremely eclectic game, actually. It's also just as much aesthetic-building, exploration, and puzzle. And there is a boss fight now too! You're free to follow the lore/story content or not (it's really good though), but if you play with some homies it also feels like an incredible story and adventure unto itself.

This coming from someone who doesn't like the ocean, too. And even my homies who ""don't like to play barbies"" still put some thought into making an aesthetic raft.

It's a slow and grindy start, but after you progress a bit, it gets very fun, and there are no dull moments ever."
8819,no

8824,"The game is super fun, a bit confusing at the start and I wish there was better description on some items but overall I'm very happy about the game. Sometimes when the waves are intense I feel a bit dizzy but it's not too bad in general.

The building is pretty fun I guess, there is lot of different items you can make but that's about it. Got it for free as a gift so gladly no monetary loss here. If your ideal game is just building and shushing seagulls away from your potatoes this might be for you.

8842,"Played about 50 hours...taking it pretty slow and hit a lot of early islands before progressing to the story islands. So far so good. Pretty chill game, playing on normal. Would be a lot of fun to play solo or with a partner (honestly most ages could find fun/use in it). Game reminds me of Stranded Deep and Subnautica. Only real gripe with the game so far is the transferring of supplies from one container to the next. You have to do it one by one dragging each thing. Please implement a 1 button transfer option...maybe pressing ""T"" transfers a whole stack and maybe a UI button transfers the whole capacity of the container. Other than that small issue, good stuff so far!"

8852,yes
8853,"IDK about this one.  The UI, something I rarely complain about just fights you.  WHY is the quickbar NOT labelled?  You need that one thing quickly?  Good luck cuz you're swapping out this that and the other and it has that irritating feature of putting every new pickup in your hotbar first instead of in your inventory.

The mechanics are just head scratchers.  One initial thing you need to do is make a water still.  You make water by also creating a PLASTIC cup then filling it with seawater then starting a fire under (the plastic cup) and return later to get fresh water from the same cup?...to quote a funny SNL skit ""that's is not how that goes.""  That would result it a melted plastic blob.

IDK, obviously it moves on and on and I'm not so annoyed by lack of explanation as the really bad U.I. decisisions.  They've somehow made it infuriating and I can't fully explain how but it needs not be.

Still a thumbs up cuz I don't like sticking it to the Devs for an annoyance that might just be me but....Subnautica comes to mind and that is super intuitive and as Todd said ""it just works"".  I wish this did as well for me."

8867,"They are a little preachy in their story line, but seem to have broken to the realization the survival is hard, which is good. Though a lot of the system is macro approached, for what it is and how it represents accelerated day and night make it all kind of balanced, and in the end about people just trying to live."

8872,"Why does my heart beat?
Its a ceaseless dredge pumping the thick sludge.
I used to enjoy seeing the oceans. I felt comfort knowing another wave would lay on the pearly shores. Dimmed by twilight of another day spent free in a world of innocence.
My world has faded. The undertow of gemstone waves gestate a cruel iridescence. The beauty and sickness of oil.
My life needs purpose; the gasoline in my veins.
Beauty and life replaced by an ocean of opportunity. Swirls of plastic idols, a monument to our greed.
A raft to build. To keep yourself afloat in this alien world that will swallow you whole. Fed and grown by a perpetuating cycle of waste.
Take what you can reach and take more. Slay the bottom feeding sharks that have acclimatised to this environment.
But know that the food chain above you will never loosen. The only way to go is down."

8888,"No fun allowed. Constant hard labor. Zero quality of life within any of the mechanics. You can't even consume food from your inventory without dragging it to the quickbar. This alone would have been a minor complaint if the character you're playing wasn't a gluttonous gourmand who even after eating 6 fishes, 3 entire watermelons, 4 baked potatoes and a couple of chicken legs didn't still somehow feel peckish and absolutely starving within 6 minutes of game time. Absolute joke.

Edit: Balboa Island is by far the worst gaming experience of my entire life."
8889,i hate the bears
8890,"Already, I love this game. I've been playing solo and I can see how it would be much easier with co-op. I may be progressing a bit slowly, but it's definitely doable. I've rather enjoyed the idea, lore, and some of the random encounters of the islands already. There's a bit of cheapness to the shark. It's always following you and always biting off pieces of your raft. But you can usually find enough materials to rebuild lost segments. I also found out the hard way that when you lose your raft it's over even if you're on dry land. It doesn't make sense outside of the game why you couldn't feasibly settle an island. I feel there should be a reason why you can't live and build on one. Maybe they'll do that if they ever make a Raft 2? However, I get where the devs are coming from in that they want you to be on a raft. It is called Raft, after all.

Other than that, the game has a nice and pleasant progression. There are really fun times sitting on the raft through various weather events, animal sightings, etc. I've yet to be really challenged other than while diving with the shark always around. And there's the constant nagging of hunger and water. But it's not overbearing. It's just another mechanic that has to be maintained. Right now, I'm working on getting enough metal to fortify my raft so the shark can't bite it down, then I'm trying to hit up a large island. I can tell that I have so much more to explore after only playing about 5-6 hours. I can't wait to explore more on this floating adventure. 9.7/10."
8891,Great fun and it is a blast to play with friends!
8892,"This is a great game, and not that its finished it's even better"
8893,great just chill and relax game
8894,"Best game, very chill.
Best way to relax after loosing 10 games in dota"
8895,Was will man mehr?
8896,"Great game and fun to chill and build.
Minecraft meets Waterworld with a touch of Valheim.
No controller support in 2022 holds this game back from being amazing."
8897,shark go rawr
8898,Gud.
8899,its nice i guess
8900,"finally got to 69 hours on this game, and trust me it's a good game."
8901,Big *ss bird will kill you more than the shark itself. 10/10 would play again
8902,"Great story line, fun to play with friends and still fun solo"
8903,I LIKE RAFT
8904,good
8905,Fricken sick innit blud
8906,idk i just liked the entire thing. if people like challenges its a fun game and i would totaly recomend it
8907,Pretty uninteresting take on the survival game imo. Main gameplay loop is grindy and boring. Art style is ok I guess but other than that wasn't much fun. Probably gets better after 5 or so hours but with so many other good survival games I don't see the point in wasting my time getting to the good stuff.
8908,dragon boat training
8909,I like that the game gives you presure that ypu have to eat some thing vary fast so you do not die
8910,"Brilliant game, I love it."
8911,game is good. i hate sharks more than ever before.
8912,"Mate, dis is a well gud floater game"
8913,great
8914,"Do NOT be fooled by ""final"" in Final Chapter,
this game is still incomplete.

[The Story]
The story and the ""raft"" concept of the game do not relate to each other enough.
The raft building progressing do not match the progression of the story almost at all,
except for one or two items that you need to move around blocked / closed spaces.

[The Raft]
Guess what, you get additional recipes for tools and new resources AFTER the main story ends...
As I said, the raft building progression and story progression do not match.

[The Positives]
So, despite an awful synergy between the story and the raft building / survival,
this game is still fan to play, especially with friends.
You can enjoy your raft journey, BUT it will be heavily limited by short and underwhelming story,
unless you are a gamer who does not care about the story, and cares more about the survival / building aspect,
then you will enjoy playing this game.
*Although, ""survival"" aspect isn't developed to its full potential, either."
8915,very good
8916,Awesome game
8917," really fun and time consuming game, if you like adventure exploration games its a winner, but if you play on normal be prepared to loose all your stuff when you die! but its a very fun game with a descent story, if you hate deep water you'll  have to face those fears"
8918,It requires a lot of grinding

8926,nice n innovative game
8927,good fun

8929,amazing chilled game!
8930,"A really relaxing game with a gripping story. being able to chose which difficulty to play on is great for whether you want a challenge or just a chill out sail on some floating debris. 
so far, ive put 105 hours into this game and could easily double that with testing out some raft designs and exploring the map a little more!"

8936,would be better if the story evolves around raft instead of islands etc.
8937,I need more friends because my mind is too linear after finishing the story :(((
8938,Bruce is not so easy to kill
8939,This game starts out simple but there is way more to it than meets the eye as the game goes on.
8940,Awesome Game!
8941,s
8942,great game
8943,IT S IS GOOD you should buy it!
8944,"Beware: I'm very early into my play through of this game but I will describe it with one word: FUN. I'll be honest, I thought it was gonna be another stupid little game my friends and I sunk 2 hours into and never touched again. It is far from that. We are having a blast creating roles for ourselves and creating a really bad-ass raft along the way, this game, goodness... there's just something about it. It's the first game in a LONG time we are planning for and preparing for ahead of time and actually having a blast just talking about all the things we've seen people do that we want to and how we're going to do it. This game is exactly what my friend group needed as we have felt a lot of the games we played have recently become stale and repetitious to us. This game is just great. I cannot rate it high enough and I really recommend you and your friend group ( if you have one ) look into this game with some serious intentions, I can tell it's going to be a time sink, but not one we will soon regret. Thank you for making this game! We really needed it. <3"
8945,v
8946,This is one of the many accounts that I have installed raft on. In total i have about 3-400 combined hours on raft and it is one of my favourite games. I have reviews complaining about the boss fights and difficulty of certain aspects of the game but that's what makes it so enjoyable. Chapter 3 added 3 more island and a lot of new story. From humble begins on a 2x2 grid to a large biofuel powered floating factory raft is truly an amazing game.
8947,Baby shark doo doo doo doo doo doo
8948,yes
8949,"Great story. Great mechanics. Throw hooks, poke Bruce, scare birds, and occasionally deforest an island. Oh and build ridiculously large and laggy structures with friends. Seriously fun, even after the story is over the game is simple yet entertaining. What’s not to love about floating on the ocean with a shark friend?"
8950,gret gaym
8951,good game
8952,its very good
8953,its fun
8954,cool
8955,This is a fun game to play with friends or alone. Minecraft on the open ocean with an interesting story.
8956,"fun game, final chapter is out now, you can literally build a city or ship or even both endgame so yeah, its great as well with friends which is easy to setup and have fun, the only shit thing is the shark but the game gives u stuff to make that go away, just buy it trust."
8957,"good, evil bird hurt me with stone"
8958,"Amazing game, hands down some of the most fun I've had with a game in a while. Easily a 10/10 for me"
8959,it good
8960,Great game for a group of people
8961,Wonderful game for people to play together! Good story and endless possibilities to be creative. Would definitely recommend.
8962,"Such a fun ride. Me and my SO played almost 60 hours together, the longest of any game."
8963,"A deeply inspired crafting/survival sandbox concept given a full story. Cheerful visual style in a sobering setting, the seemingly open-ended world makes clever use of story points and tech progression to drive the player seamlessly through a consistently surprising and delighting narrative. On top of that, it's an inviting drop in / drop out co-op experience, allowing for both an absorbing singleplayer journey and an awesome mutiplayer one.

I am super impressed with what this game has become in its development cycle, and the full version is absolutely worth being in the favorites list!

Playtime through the story while enjoying all the sandbox elements along the way was 100 hours for two people playing together. Still enjoying the sandbox now and will likely add dozens more hours."
8964,great
8965,"Fun and relaxing game. Occasional non-graphics related performance issues exist, but generally waiting it out solves the problem."
8966,bueno
8967,the shark's name is bruce
8968,"Mechanics are easy to learn, and crafting is very simple."
8969,Awesome game. A little stressful when you get started but as you get your raft built it begins to chill out and becomes a very chill game. Stick with it because it does get easier as you progress.
8970,so many Bruce
8971,its a good game its just not my kind of game thats why i refunded it
8972,the game is basically resource grind and die from the shark. 10/10
8973,If I ever come across a shark named Bruce. I'm a poke him with a stick #@%! BRUCE!!!!
8974,good game
8975,"Immediately to start out, I want to say this: I really enjoyed my time with this game, but I did have some issues during my final playthrough of the story. For the most part, the general survival gameplay is fun, at least during the mid-game point. In the early game, depending on how things end up, it can be an incredibly tedious and not fun to progress, specifically because you are stuck with practically no way to control where you go, and in certain scenarios, you can end up with with very little materials to work with for a while. Alongside that, by the time I reached the giant bubble city in my playthrough, I never had to worry about materials ever again, which made the experience a fair bit less interesting and more boring. Most of the islands were quite fun to explore with my friend, though there were a few big issues we encountered. There were many different times, especially on the newer islands, where we had no idea how we were expected to proceed with the story, even with the help of the notes. 2 big examples of this were [spoiler] with the shark boss battle in the third to last area [/spoiler] and [spoiler] learning we had to go to the observatory on temperance [/spoiler]. With the information we had available, we didn't know how we were supposed to proceed, and were just stuck wandering around aimlessly. After about 20 minutes for both, we finally gave in and looked at a walkthrough. Another big thing to note is that [spoiler] the final island really plays into the idea of platforming, which the game does not do very well, as well as very cryptic puzzles, in which the mechanics are not well explained, at least in my opinion [/spoiler]. In the end, I would say I had quite a lot of fun, but I'm not sure if I would've enjoyed it nearly as much had I not had a friend to play it with."
8976,great game!!!!!!
8977,good with friends
8978,Amazing! Raft 2 when?
8979,It crashes and restarts my pc CONSTANTLY! And I have a powerful ass PC with no issues with no other games it's unplayable don't waste your time
8980,good gets boring after awhile (i didnt play with any friends)
8981,"This is a reasonable take on a survival game.   I enjoyed the premise and setting just fine.   Where I ran into trouble was with how tedious it was to kept my character fed and watered.     I am also no huge fan of the inventory UI, I felt like I was constantly running out of space while trying to blend various types of scavenging.    For me the, the final straw was how hard it was to find ROCKS to make my damn anchor.    I finally hooked enough crates and stuff to find rocks, joyfully made my anchor, and a shark ate it.

8982,ye

8987,"Fairly casual survival game, didn't go in with high expectations but damn was that a great game.  10/10"
8988,I LOVE this game! Multiplayer accessibility it great and the ability to actually make you jump in alarm/excitement is wonderful! I highly recommend Raft.

8993,Shark go brrrr
8994,"Game is great until the final act, where it takes a frustrating turn from a puzzle / crafting into a combat heavy game as it feels the developer ran out of ideas how to finish their game. The boss fights do not work well in the game and are super frustrating as they do not match the gameplay of 99% of the game."

9011,"Highly recommend this game, it's a very relaxed survival craft game that has a lot of good developments over time. I've kept an eye on it as the Early Access went on and I was super satisfied with how the game developed that I decided to buy it when it fully released. If you are even remotely interested in survival crafting games, this is one to definitely add to your list."
9012,It is really good and fun to play with friends
9013,great with your other dumbass friends
9014,well just started getting comfortable after about 20 or so hours then the game crashing began. couldn't figure the problem out. my computer is really good and reliable but game is unreliable!!!
9015,"its a fun game to play with freinds
"
9016,Rafting game which is good until very last story quest titled UTOPIA.   Some puzzles which are not too hard to solve but then you get to a jumping course which is beyond frustrating.  It is garbage and makes no sense in this game.  Literally tried jumping the course which has about 5-6 obstacles and makes you repeat if you fail.  Obstacle #3 was beyond ridiculous and spent about 30mins to an hour trying. This is frustrating since you cant proceed and end the story line.  It is an absolute piece of junk move the devs added and makes no sense in this type of game.  I would not recommend wasting the hours and money on this due to this area.
9017,"Easyish to pickup, enough depth to be interesting."
9018,Chauvin shark
9019,"IS A GREAT GAME, yo creo que podria ser mejor en algunas cosas, como agregando un minimapa que se vaya desbloqueando segun uno vayas descubriendo o algo parecido. porque cuando juegas es dificil muchas veces ubicarse o si juegas con amigos no sabes donde ellos estan, ya que no tenemos coordenadas ni mapas ni nada para saber o ubicarnos y coordenarse."
9020,Fun
9021,"This is an amazing game.

This game just has so much to offer. There is an interesting story, fun gameplay, replayabbility, and so much more.
At first you start on a small wooden raft, which you will later expand into a mighty fortress. Well if you want that is. This game allows you to do whatever the heck you want. You want to rebuild a reallife ship? Sure go for it. You want to build Mario? Sans? or even yourself? You can do that to. Well enough of the building side of raft. In case you don´t know, raft has a ton of ""Story islands"" these can be explored in order to oviously progress the story, but also find amazing, game changing blueprints, which you will never want to give up again. The islands are filled with puzzles to block you from just walking through them. These are fun, really fun actually. So fun infact that I decided to start a new playthrough just after finishing my first Chapter 3 one. Just so I could play them again. Allthough the game is tectinicly over after finishing the story, You can still do so much more, like go achievement hunting, which is actually really fun. Well except for the Survive 365 days achievement, as you´ll have to stay in 1 world to get that one, and it takes forever. There is no point at wich I don´t have something to do, until I finish my raft. If it´s story,building,  resource collecting, or whatever a rafter wants to do. You´ll find something to do if you really want to. And even if you´re the kinda  type to just rush trough a game and then never come back, I think it´s still worth it for you, because as previously stated the story is really fun to play."

Expand, grow crops and build quality of life improvements while dealing with the ever-present shark looking to take a bite out of you and/or your floating home. Research more advanced upgrades and acquire better materials and the game truly begins: you are a Forward Scout, one of many tasked with recovering and rebuilding society after a massive rise in sea level changed humanity. Discover the signs of survivors and follow the trail to uncover the mysteries of the new world. Investigate the rumors of a Rafter's Utopia and discover the future of society on an ocean-covered planet. Build your floating dream home and pilot it to a variety of destinations, each with their own unique secrets and rewards.

9048,"As someone who has a fear of water in video games, I love this game! The thing that gets me into this game the most is how rewarding the game feels. Everything you do goes into your raft in some way. You're on your raft so much that you always get to see your progress from that tiny raft you start out with. If you're into building and organization, this game will satisfy you! The story is pretty decent but I wouldn't say it's the strongest aspect of the game. The graphics are great for it's art style. The music helps make the game really relaxing. This has become one of my favorite games.

There are bugs here and there of course but nothing I've run into are game breaking. I think my only complaints are that some things you craft I feel like it's duration runs out a little to quick and the water going through the bottom floor of your raft means you have to build a second story to your raft so your animals don't get swept away by the water."

9084,"Fantastic fun with friends! You basically move from place to place like a swarm of locusts consuming everything in your path; cutting down the last trees on Earth, hunting animals to extinction, and muttering curses whenever there isn't any more plastic pollution in your corner of the ocean. All this is in order to feed the insatiable appetite of your floating factory fortress, so you can survive long enough to move on and consume ever more scarce resources.

In a wonderfully twisted kind of commentary, the game also keeps giving you notes on how the world ended because people did exactly what you spend your time in the game doing. Solid 10/10."

9088,"I play this with my husband. Wish i could turn off the ocean though, it is so realistic i sometimes get a little sea sick. But loads of fun and worth playing, especially with a friend if you have the option!!!"
9089,Rafting like never before!
9090,This game made me hate birds.
9091,You build cool raft. You survive on good raft. The end
9092,The game is a lot better when you play with friends.
9093,A nice survival game with plenty of bang per buck.
9094,so many to explore and a story too
9095,Co-op nicely done
9096,"Love it! It has a very fun and interesting story, which I love. But it's also so relaxing to just drift around the sea and build on your raft. I've had this game for like 3 years and i'm not even close to bored. Alone or with friends I really recommend it!!"
9097,10/10 sharks
9098,Its good and i like Shary
9099,Great game - bought it while in early access and started it over once it was fully released. Fun and interesting while also beautiful and relaxing.

9101,i hate this game. it is torture.
9102,I have played this game a lot and I can say that it was well worth my money. Could someone tell the shark to stop biting me though. (Better with friends)
9103,since when did i play this for 43 hours..
9104,good
9105,My raft was inside an island and items fall through the floor when dropping
9106,Lots of fun building aspects with friends
9107,Very fun and entertaining game
9108,"SUCH A GOOD GAME AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
my favourite"
9109,"This game is kind of hostile to new players -- you're literally thrust into the thick of it without a single hint.  My first few moments of the game were spent wondering why I was dying as a shark I couldn't immediately see was chewing on my toes.

Turning off hostile creatures helps a lot, but the game in later stages seems to forget that you don't want to fight, and the last two stages (Utopia and Temperance) casually ""forget"" you don't want to deal with combat.  The last boss battle basically made me give up, that point became no longer fun.  In fact, Utopia is kind of a miserable stage full of video game tropes I hate -- I will never forgive this game for making me do the windmill jumping puzzle twice for instance.

That said, I still recommend it, because of the incredible joy of the first time you hook up engines to your raft.  That was so much fun!  In fact, raft building is a delight in this game and there's so much you can do with it.  That's the most fun aspect and by itself is worth playing the game.  I ultimately had more fun than not, but I wish the last couple stages would be easier on folks that don't want to deal with combat."

9153,i like this game
9154,I really enjoy playing this game with friends. Has a lot of jumping puzzles for story quest items. The seagulls are the real villains.
9155,IT FUN
9156,"I really like this game cause it kinda forces you to build your little boat up from nothing in order to eventually control the direction you're going and all that. Compare that to most survival games like Rust or Valheim where you can almost immediately control how things look. You can decorate your house and stuff, sure, but think of the environment in which you reside in this, especially in the beginning. You start off completely isolated and alone, a tiny little nothing that could be destroyed pretty easily and pushed around by the environment at will. Given time and effort, however, you can begin to exert your own control on the elements by building things like sails and engines, enabling you to pick and choose where you want to go, when you want to go there. It forces the player to really work on their own little projects to enable their own survival in a way that I haven't seen other games try to compete with.
The netcode seems to be fine for the most part. Occasionally I or my friends will glitch out and disconnect, but it's rare and I find it acceptable in it's current state.
Not much to say about the music, it doesn't seem particularly amazing nor is it low quality, just middling.
Controls are simple enough, though I'd like to see improvements on moving things. It's a little bit janky at the moment, but nothing too heinous, just something I'm hoping the devs will work on with another update.
I haven't gotten particularly far in the main story, but it seems to be fine as it is. The only real problem I have is that the flowers have no use in the early game. I've heard they're good for late-game things, but I haven't ever gotten far enough to actually use them, so hopefully devs find a way to implement those somehow. Maybe making them more rare would be better. Alongside the flowers, several of the schematics are easily discovered, but can only be built later on. These things are minor and can be fixed very easily, however. Not anything I can really complain about.
Overall, many of the problems I've encountered can be fixed and the gameplay is pretty solid thus far. Would recommend for anyone that likes survival crafting stuff, whether playing solo or with friends. 8.5/10"
9157,Amazing and fully recommended for anyone interested in the survival genre.
9158,super fun play with friends
9159,meh definitely a game better with friends
9160,
9161,"This game is pretty good. My only particular issue with it is the insanely low amount of durability tools and equipment have. For this, I highly recommend the No Durability Plus mod. Very useful to set the durability multiplier up 7 or 8 times and give meaning to the metal tools."
9162,.
9163,ghghgzhhzhzzgzhzhgzhzhzzz
9164,somehow more interactive than sea of thieves
9165,"Pretty challenging survival game
Plastic is a precious commodity 
It's great"
9166,The game mechanics and puzzles are obtuse and no explanation or guidance is provided. Even the Raft Wiki is insufficient. This game entirely lacks direction.
9167,"A true early access to 1.0 success story. I played this game the day it was available. It was buggy at first but also immediately fun. The developers constantly came out with sizeable and original elements to the game, both in terms of its overarching story and gameplay items and enhancements. Truely a base building/adventure/exploration/story focused masterpiece."
9168,It was worth the wait for the final chapter of raft... for an inexpensive game I rate it very good now that it's done
9169,this is a game i can confirm
9170,do you like building? do you like boats? do you like boat eating sharks? whatever the answer buy this game
9171,Very Enjoyable
9172,great game

"
9174,VERY FUN SURVIVAL GAME TO PLAY WITH ANOTHER!!!!
9175,"mum bought me this game.
me like this game.

"
9176,"Got this to play with my kids and I am just really disappointed. The UI is awful, the shark is a tedious mess, the wear rate on at least some items is way over the top. Fighting anything is.. an afterthought? I dunno, it sucks. And there is no map to feel like you are exploring, you are just there. Like old arcade and 8/16 bit racing games where you can tell the car isn't moving in the world, the world is moving past the car. This doesn't feel right.

I mean.. it just isn't grabbing me at all and I wish it would. I don't know how long it takes to feel like you've accomplished something in this game, but 4 hours and it hasn't yet."
9177,"Overall really fun and enjoyable, especially with friends. My only complaint is that some of the achievements can be really grindy and a pain to get."
9178,"Played with my s/o and we both really enjoyed this game and what it has to offer!  It's so fun to plan your little (or in our case, very large) raft and the story is pretty solid."

9187,"Big recommend and a very fun game. 
+ I played this game in early access & full release as multiplayer. Both times I have played this game it was wonderful. 
+ Crafting is very easy to pick up in this game.
+ Upgrades feel rewarding and come as you progress through the game at a reasonable rate.
+ Cooking is probably one of my favorite aspects of this game, it feels really well thought out and pretty unique!
+ Decor is SO plentiful in this game - if you're here for the aesthetics, they will come!!
+ Story is well thought out and very cute. Once you get the ball rolling its pretty easy to figure out where to go next, but each chapter provides its own challenges. Each chapter is tied in well and nothing feels like excessive 'filler'. 

The overall game is great and we made some fun memories in multiplayer. Give it a shot! Genuinely enjoyed this game and I hope they release future chapters!

There are many people who actually haven't bought this game and think that it's a normal survival game without story etc. No, this game offers you a great, compelling story. Maps full of puzzles and various environments. Hands down it's the best survival game I've ever played."

9223,"Very good survival game/basebuilder where the base you build is also your transportation to explore with.  The story is pretty light but the story islands are all very interesting, with puzzles and some jumping that gets frustrating on the last one."
9224,it is most certainly not worth 20 USD
9225,A great time with friends
9226,go play it
9227,"This game has been so fun and under rated. As a full game, it feels so clean and extremely fun. 10/10 would recommend and do."
9228,Its super fun to play alone and with friends.
9229,"My kids enjoy it.  It can be difficult at times, just trying to get the right stuff to build what you need.  It's not bad"
9230,Noice
9231,awesome game defo time consumer so make sure you're up to the task. much more enjoyable with friends but solo isnt bad either =]
9232,Is an anagram of Fart
9233,This game is laggy and buggy. Please fix it.
9234,Make it so you can drive the snowmobile anywhere!!!!
9235,"its good for firends and solo
"
9236,"First played Raft when it initially released in Early Access, but put it down until the game was complete. And like most Early Access Survival Crafting games on Steam... it took a long time.

However I can pretty confidently say that this final version was worth the wait! A really relaxed alternative to something like The Forest, ARK, or Rust. It's really fun to see your raft go from this tiny 4x4 wooden platform to a full ship with engines, sails, farms, and even livestock.

The story is serviceable, but the environments you get to explore are nice changes in pace every hour or so, even if they are a bit sparse in regards to the actual content within them.

If you're looking for a really fun take on Minecraft Skyblock, this is a great time with friends! Probably wouldn't recommend, solo however.

(The only thing I would change about this game is how quickly your character needs to intake food/water. Can really put a damper on the exploration experience if you're not carrying TONS of meals and drinks.)"

9244,"Amazing game, would recommend to anyone! They crushed this game! Had so much fun playing it from early access to now!!!"
9245,AMAZING GAME! The devs really put some love into this. toook us forever to beat and it was great. Bosses were hard. Puzzles were harder. Loved it!!!! One of the best co op survival games i have played!
9246,Water
9247,This game is amazing theres so much to do and unlock the story is quite in depth and the gameplay of surviving and thriving on your own raft is amazing it also blends farming and fun in a good way such as many of your needs being not too challenging but not too easy too achieve

9252,"Fun survival game with a decent amount of depth, but lacking truly interesting big upgrades from what I've seen. It also doesn't have nearly enough basic (wood/clay/etc) materials for large teams which results in an annoying overall gameplay loop. Solid 7.5/10 game."

definitely not a game worth melting your pc over"
9265,"Nice game, such a beautiful sharks. 6/5"
9266,... .... ..- - ..- .--.
9267,You spawn on a tiny piece of wood in the ocean. You get more tiny pieces of wood to make a bigger piece of wood. You attach that wood onto your wood. That wood is your raft. You get MORE wood to live on your wood. All I'm saying is R.I.P the Amazon Rain forest.
9268,Best to play with another player or on easy alone. It sucks loosing all your loot when you die on hard.

9283,"I've been playing this little gem with my wife and daughter and we are having a blast. We decided to try the  game without knowing too much about it and have fallen completely in love with it. We started out on normal mode, but found that a bit too difficult, especially while we were trying to figure out what to do, so we set it to easy and found the right balance of thriving  and surviving. Our raft started out as a few boards clapped together and has become this two story beautiful floating home. 

When we first started playing, the shark, hunger and thirst were all troublesome for us, but 20 plus hours in we have it figured out. Not realizing you could kill the shark, we all let out a little cheer the first time we did it. Then we chowed down on some shark steaks. 

Really this game is a lot of fun and I highly recommend it."
9284,An enjoyable experience with other players. Vast and fun.
9285,cool and chilled game play with your homies

Some of my friends' feel it's a little slow in the beginning, but if you have some patience and get to the navigation stage it really takes off from there! (You'll know what I'm talking about when you get there!)"

9299,"Beginning is great:
Suriving in the ocean, building a raft, unlocking new features. Over 80 hours of fun.

The end is horrible:
Ridiculous puzzles, and 3d-jump`n´run, bossfights where you do the same all over again, like destroing a pillar with one hit, the two hits, then three.
Or stacking 5 boxes to reach a new hight, then (guess what) stacking 6 boxes,...

The last chapter really destroyed this game, at least in my oppinion. I couldn`t finish it!

It is really sad!"

9301,"dont get boring

9305,This game is crazy good and fun to play with friends. Its really hard to play solo so i dont recommend that.
9306,rilly good
9307,lmao i cant even begin to describe how bad this game is.. just dont waste your money period.
9308,its fun not the best but fun
9309,it is great so much to do
9310,funny and simple
9311,"[h2]Right now it feels like a wanna-be story-driven adventure game that tries too hard and forgets it is supposed to be a survival game where you pick up random items floating around your raft.[/h2]

The building part is fun, and picking up stuff is fun, but then there's this over-scaled story that is physically vast, empty, boring, and has nothing to do with the basic mechanics or even the game's name. Should there be a need for stories, a variety of smaller events/quests, even text-based ones, within that gameplay be a way better experience, in my opinion.

That alone, as much as I enjoy chilling on my raft, I couldn't recommend this game to people looking for survival or adventure games, for now anyway, as there seem to be more updates to come as far as I know. 

As mentioned, I do enjoy the actual rafting, even if it's just picking up stuff and building, with a weird fishing trading mechanic. It has its moments, but I recommend playing with a group of friends or picking up some mods to better enjoy where the game should shine at this stage.

Maybe future updates could bring some of the elements I craved;  catching the everchanging flow of wind and water with my raft's sail and rudder, traveling and trading between locations and rafters, helping them while benefiting myself as I explore the endless ocean and islands, picking up items floating around to keep me afloat, further perfecting the raft I build, and so on."

9317,"""Ah, pretty water. Alright, so I grabbed enough junk to build a hammer, and now I...

Oh, a shark bit part of my raft off. But I can build a new raft, so I'll just hop off onto this island and start fresh-
Wait... I can't build a new raft? My raft floated away already... Okay whatever, new game.

Alright, can't let the raft float away this time! I'll build an anchor. Here, let me test it out... Oh, it's one-time use.....
... I think I might not like this game."""
9318,This is the best game I ever played.
9319,"I personally really enjoy games that include a peaceful mode for a very relaxed game play experience so most of my review is based on a single, peaceful mode play-through. If you don't find pleasure from being savvy with your resources and the grind to get them and a slow upgrading process, or if you don't like the murky void of underwater I would not recommend this game. The puzzles and parkour were challenging without being frustrating most of the time. The scenic design is fantastic, and the story being pieced together through exploring is well done. I may be done with the story, but I have a feeling I'm going to spend many more hours designing the best raft I can!"

9328,"when you start out you're just like stranded on a tiny raft but as you move on it just gets so big you just feel so nice! I would recommend this to people who think they could manage health, hydration, and consumption to survive!

9332,"Amazing game, evolves as you play through the story. Hope they keep adding content"
9333,"I bought Raft after a friend recommended it. The graphics are stunning, and the music is calming, in contrast to how we are trying to scrounge supplies and food while attempting to stop the shark from chomping on our boat. Because I'm not used to playing first-person 3D games, I did feel some motion sickness, but I'm hoping I'll get used to it. After playing the standard mode for almost 6-7 hours, we had gathered enough resources to fully begin our adventure and immerse ourselves in the storyline. I've had a great time playing with my friends so far, and I'm looking forwards to the plot as well."

9335,this is a wonderfull game
9336,"First off, its really good to play with friends. Second off, the storyline is great. Finally, I personally like how you have to research new items to progress than having the ability to craft everything from the start."

9357,IT IS GOOD
9358,Survival simple y simpático que por 15€ merece la pena.
9359,Very good game with unusual setting!
9360,"It's a very fun, mindless game to play if you're stressed or anxious. I just learned there's a story line. Before I learned that, I was simply just surviving, but there's so much more than that. It's a very fun game. :)"
9361,"This game is super fun! Although it takes of time to get started, once you've got a purifier, grill, and a crop plot set up (among other things) you're almost all set! Of course you need a sail and anchors, but otherwise fairly simple (I didn't say easy) to get started."
9362,i have followed this game from all the way back from it's first release. Every update since then just made the game better. i can't find another game like this. Having a game where you are on the sea and can build what you like on you're moving base is really something i wish more developers would make more use of. A well made and well polished game that can suck you in for hours.
9363,It's a good game and it's even more fun when you have friends to play with.
9364,It can be pretty buggy and the puzzles can be hard to beat without looking it up. A fun game for about like 20-40 hours of gameplay.
9365,"I have been playing with my partner who sits right across from me in our studio. It has been a blast exploring islands spread out on the open sea as a team! It really tests our communication skills since there is very little to go off of, especially when we lose each other and try to get back in touch. Overall, a really great survival game!"
9366,:D
9367,"It is a fun survival exploration game. I just started playing it and I am addicted! This game poses a challenge of maintaining your food and water while picking up items to move forward in the game. I really recommend this game to everyone, its a fun experience."

9386,"I was skeptical about buying this game. I love building games, rpg's, and survival games but I just felt like this was gonna be for kids and overall dumb. I'm 30 years old and just by the trailers and pictures I was not interested.
DAMN WAS I WRONG!!!
I am absolutely addicted. today alone I've spent at least 10 hours playing. the game has multiple difficulty levels ranging from creative (simply building with no limit), Peaceful ( enjoy the game without enemy's attacking you, then the normal difficulty levels. only downfall is its missions are short. figure about 40 hours play through if you're just trying to do missions. but there is a lot more. 
if you have considered Raft but haven't bought it I'm JUST SAYING DO IT!!!!"

9390,"I played Raft with 2 other friends. Overall I found the game to be a very enjoyable experience and I recommend it for any group of friends looking for a survival game to play together. Our playthrough of the whole story took about 19 hours with a little bit of prior knowledge about the first half of the story. I have two nitpick criticisms, #1 the final boss is somewhat underwhelming and #2 the first half of the game feels completely detached from the second half. Once you start the story after surviving for a few hours, the game becomes less about survival and becomes more about exploration and puzzle solving. I didnt mind this but you might if you are looking for a survival focused experience."

9393,PRETTY COOL
9394,"i have super mixed feelings on this game, it  could honestly be great but the things holding it back REALLY hold it back
ill just list some pros and cons
cons
- the shark feels like a place holder, it serves no purpose than to just annoy the player, and poses no actual challenge 
- this game is ridiculously grindly, and has some of the worst loot for bigger islands
- the ai is dumb, ai see play, ai charge at player, ai repeat
- the big story islands suck, the arent fun to explore and have bad loot for the effort you put in 
pros
- pretty graphics
- customizing your raft is the best part of the game 
- theres a great concept here, it just needs some polish"

Played with 3 friends, we had great fun.

Totally recommend.

En porteño:

Refrescante como cocucha con hielo en verano, un distino, jogo bonito.

Con los de siempre, se vuelve a jugar.

Es la que va."
9411,"This game is the most lazy survival game I've ever played, the ending is a stupid ass slide-show that leaves you majorly disappointed and enraged at the developers. The people literally give you food and a vending machine for beating the final boss. On top of the stupid ending the villain is defeated in the most lazy way possible and he cannot be killed.

Aside from the lazy and poorly put together story there are also major underlying problems that make this game worse than its genre competitors.

Titanium is gathered in overly difficult ways that don't make any sense. What was the point of adding it if it is so rare to come by and if everything that requires it needs so much of it. Like yeah game, I would love to get all these new tools and gadgets but how to I get titanium in bulk? Fish for 5 hours just so a vendor can sell me three per island, no thanks. Search up youtube videos so I can find the secrete stashes that I would've never found by myself; sure that seems like a lazy way to implement this, ""thumbs up"". You guys could've at least given us a bunch of titanium for the ending instead of a dumbass farmers market, a slide show with narration, and npc that have ungrateful and clueless dialogue. 

The rhino shark boss fight was better and more difficult than the alpha hyena and even it wasn't that good. Seriously the boss loot is so underwhelming and could be better design by anyone else. 

The only fun lore islands were the dome and the snow island. It was smart to add a mode of transportation on the snow island but every other lore island just seems like a chore to run around a do anything. 

All in all, this game is so lazy and there is much more to complain about but I found myself the most infuriated by the ending of the game and by how stupid it is the get titanium. This game is more shit than anything else I've ever played and I was more satisfied uninstalling the game and writing this review than beating the game itself.

9421,"Really fun survival game with a ton of content and great gameplay. Raft's progression and story are masterfully built, forming a cohesive and enjoyable experience. The building and exploration aspects of the game are very well made - you are given full control over your raft's layout and looks, and the locations are all very detailed and interesting. It's a great game to play alone or with others, I would definitely recommend it."

9424,hgv
9425,so cool and funny and good hahah makes me happy just good hey
9426,THIS GAME IS SO BORING
9427,"A solid sandbox adventure.  Smaller budget and less production value than say, Subnautica, but the survival mechanics and technology tree is pretty solid.

It does have some rough edges, it starts out super grindy with the amount of time that you have to spend gathing food, water and fighting off the shark, but with each upgrade you discover that becomes less and less of an issue.  There's also some balancing issues with the latter parts of the end-game quest line, and accessing a wiki is pretty much required in terms of understanding how to gather many of the resources at the start.

I enjoyed my time with Raft, warts and all, and played single-player through completion of the main quest, unlocking and building most of the tech upgrades.  I give it a B."
9428,"Good content, worth the time spent"
9429,"The game is very fun, especially with friends. The story took years to be completed by the devs, but it was still fun when the updates came out. I definitely recommend getting this game, lots of content, lots of creativity can be used, and lots of fun. The only bad part is that they replaced chicken and jam with steak and jam, why?"
9430,"Great game, need patience to start build but once you good is ezy."
9431,"Highly suggest playing with a friend, put the spark back in to playing games for me"
9432,Very fun to play with other people
9433,"The survival and base-building aspects are fun. The moment you start to follow the story the game losses any sense of fun. For a game about being on a raft they make you get off the raft to search island after island with scavenger hunt style quests. Every single story location is an increasingly frustrating and bigger version of ""find 5 things and bring them to place, then find 5 more."" Once you figure out this mechanic is the game's only trick you start to dread following any more story. You could ignore it... but then there isn't really much else to do."

9466,"This game has come a long way! I got this forever ago on early access and play it every so often. It has a story and an objective but my favorite part it building my Raft and exploring the islands. Searching for rare animals and hunting for tiki's! My Raft has long since ceased being a ""raft"" and is much more a ship at this point! I wish I could have an aquarium and a pool table, but other than that it's pretty perfect! The devs care about this game and they are always doing updates and fixes. If you're on the fence then wait for a sale but I think it's worth the cost."
9467,very bueno
9468,(y)
9469,kind of like ark but doesnt take itself as seriously. nice story so far.
9470,I love the game can't say enough about it. I would ask that if there was a new game+ where you could start over with your existing recipes I would play way more than I currently have.
9471,69/69 has sex
9472,"A very focused survival game. It's a scope of You against a Vast Flooded World.
Start on a small floating chunk of wood and plastic and expand it to your own.
Along the way, you will encounter islands and landmarks to help progress.
Immense amount of fun that is focused at a general audience. Play solo or with friends, the game is balanced well for both.
Although the story itself is a little long for what it is, it's mostly there as a breadcrumb trail to get you along.
Landmark puzzles are a bit tedious and sometimes too easy, and aside some pretty environments, almost nothing is reused from those places.
Each landmark is it's own special environment, which I wish would add to the pool of islands that spawn as you circle with the water currents... instead you get a small set of generated islands. From small to large.

Overall it's a great amount of fun, especially with a friend."

9483,"A good balance between sandbox, building and the basic survival aspect (eating and drinking), along with a mysterious story which you can take on at your own pace.  Fairly unique.  A lot of variety in building and decorating your raft, along with exciting (albeit basic) intermittent combat.  The game leaves a lot of how you play the game up to you, though to progress the story you'll have to build the new stuff you unlock.  Exploration is also above average, and entertaining.  Well worth it for anyone who likes builder survival games, and as a bonus, a good story you'll want to finish too."

9496,ree
9497,"good game much better with friends
"
9498,This game is as hard or as chill as you want it to be and I love that. From having multiple sharks constantly tearing your raft apart from under your feet to a setting that makes the hostile creatures ignore you. I have a save for both types depending on my mood.
9499,Love the game you can play with friends or you can play solo so on the days when i want to relax i can play peacefully solo and if i want to go into hard mode on days for fun i can its a lot of fun
9500,Worst early access I've played.
9501,"If you say anything at all bad about this game, the community mods jump on you faster than a facebook ban in an adult meme group.

My gripe is no dedicated server.

Pretty hard to play with friends when the host has to leave. I don't care about ""programming challenges"". When you make a multiplayer game you offer a dedicated server package as well. Didn't make the game to be able to do this? I don't give a rats behind, that's on you, the developers, for not starting the project out to support a feature that nearly everyone wants from any MP game."
9502,"The game is awesome to play with friends but its hard to tell each other apart in game, even with the changing of the colour of the characters clothing is doesn't help much but would be better if we could customize our own characters instead of having 2 options at the start and then having to grind the game to unlock other characters that we will never use.

If this customize character feature is in the works let me know, if not then hope it gets added in the future updates."

+relaxing ocean atmosphere

-advanced stuff access connected to story progress and unlocks too late in the game and become useless.
-there is nothing left to do after story ends. i rly wish to play more but there is no purpose left to keep playing other than expanding your raft or doing achievements. and i am not a creative person to just to build stuff to admire.
"
9520,kinda good but bit could be boring if you don't know what to do
9521,its a very fun game with friends and its a total banger!!
9522,"This game is fantastic. I put off getting it for awhile, then a friend got it for me on the Steam sale. 10/10 I should've gotten it earlier. Great for just relaxing in peaceful mode with friends or solo. The shark does get annoying after awhile though."
9523,fun :)
9524,One of the most unique experiences ive ever had playing a game. Props to the devs after many years for pulling through and making this game amazing.

i really like the innovation of the crafting of not having to go through all the menus to craft a part for a bigger item, just click on the list and boom there ya go 5/5"
9528,"This game is really fun, Crafting can feel like a chore sometimes but it has a lot of depth so it is rewarding.
The story is well made and enjoyable. This game is even more fun with friends but that is a given. Graphics are pretty nice as well."

9530,"I -LOVE- this game. I really struggle to get into games and understanding them but with this game I found it easier than most to catch on, there were a few things I got stuck on but easy to resolve with a quick YouTube or Google search. The ambient sounds, colours and game play is beautiful. I wish there was some customisation or detail with your character. All around a great game and definitely recommend <3"
9531,good
9532,shit
9533,muy bueno  !!!
9534,"This game is a nice relaxing experience....... Unless the shark is attacking your boat then its just anxiety lol.
All jokes aside I do recommend this game it is a lot of fun."
9535,"I would recommend this game to people of any age, because its a fun game you can play with you're friends and family, and it has a lot of fun things to do, for some people this isn't a good game because they like to get into the action instantly and don't like build up which this game has for a bit until you get more advanced into the game."
9536,raft is very fun to play with friends and can be played alot of ways my 2 favorite ways to play is with friends and just messing around either way this game brought lot of fun to me and my friends and would recommend to any and everyone
9537,"TLDR: Angry review.

I love this game and it's really fun to play both with friends and alone. So far, I had a great time - until now. I just got to a new large island where a Screecher just keeps obliterating me. Arrows go right through it and it hits me with its rocks from 10 feet away. I can't even kill it in melee. This clearly is a bug. I lost a great amount of gear trying to get at least some ressources of this island. It's not gamebreaking but since Raft was the first game I really enjoyed in a long time, this just frustrates me since now I'll play the rest of the game keeping this in mind and having to carefully think about bringing gear or not."
9538,good game
9539,"the exploration aspect of the game is very engaging, however, if you have a low end pc expect some lag/frame drops"
9540,"It was pretty fun, good rate of tech'ing"
9541,"games finally finished! well worth the wait for the final chapter, and such a nice and amazing game overall. if youre stuck in the early game, just catching random things from the ocean and stopping at an island every once in a while, just keep at it! theres a whole story and stuff to unlock once you get the materials and visit a few islands. well worth the effort imo, feels very rewarding"
9542,the game runs like shit but holy SHIT is it fun with friends
9543,"This game is very enjoyable with loads of fun story lines to complete, the quality of this game is outstanding and would recommend this by A LOT."
9544,"I LOVE this game. I bought it as soon as it came out, and have been dying for the last update, and in between then and now, I have played it over and over again. Overall, it's a short game, story-wise. You can definitely speed run it. But it's so nice to take your time and create things, and make your Raft this huge self-sufficient palace in the meantime! It can be really relaxing in single-player, or it can be pure chaos if you play with a bunch of your stupid friends. You can play it casually, or you can make it a challenge for yourself. The story is interesting. There's so much lore to discover in all the notes and story-telling details as you try to discover where the rest of humanity has gone. I LOVE this game! I'm going to replay it over and over and I'm so excited for the final update! I recommend this to anybody!"
9545,great all around game with lots to keep you entertained and addicted
9546,"Bruce goes chomp chomp :D 

Nothing beats the sheer amount of panic I feel when I see a 
screecher and when attempting to kill a pufferfish w/ a spear :(

10/10 open world survival game!"
9547,"New take on the survival game. You can set the difficulty depending on the amount of animal damage you want to take, or you can create a world in build mode to see just how complex of a raft you can imagine. The only down side is that there is no pause button, which is frustrating as a parent with young kids that need my help/attention every 5 minutes. I have to save my world and return to the main menu b/c I really don't trust the shark. Also, props and curses to the designers and programmers who made that shark waaayyyyy too realistic! He/she is super good looking and absolutely terrifying (this coming from someone who is absolutely terrified of sharks). My spouse finds it completely amusing to listen to me yell and freak out over the shark."

9559,Nobody has the spear when it matters.
9560,sick game bruhhh
9561,Overall this is a pretty good game but mid game can get really boring unless you are doing the story. At the beginning of the game you have a small raft with a shark that follows you and will attempt to destroy a piece of your raft every once in a while. This gives a sense of danger and makes you want to expand your raft putting your most important structures in the middle away from the edge. This is great but once you put metal around the edge of your raft. All of that goes away and now you dont have to deal with shark at all unless you fall in the water. So now you are just drifting through the water bringing up resources not having to defend against anything and this begins to get boring fairly quickly. It would be great if there was some other type of enemy or enemies that i would have to worry about. Like maybe another shark that can destroy the metal frame and then the normal shark will attack the wood or even better they could add raft pirates. That will try to jump on your raft and attack you or destroy pieces of it to steal the resources. This would give you a reason to build up more and have to defend against more besides just the animals that are only on the story quest islands. Which you usually are on for only an hour or two if that because there isnt that much to do on them. Like i said before everything else is great but i dont think i can recommend this game sense it gets boring on the ocean and thats where you spend most of your time.

9564,"Played this back in 2018 in EA. It was great back then. Now it's out and it's even better.
Great atmosphere, good mechanics and surprisingly chill for a survival game. Of course there are things that cause some stress like hunger, thirst and the like but the atmosphere balances this in a superb way.

It's a great addition to any library."

Edit: Do NOT make a mistake because right now when loading a Backup, it loads the last save even tho the Backup is from 10, 20, 30 mins ago. Is this still Alpha?

Edit: I was wrong, backup is a glitch to duplicate items.  Facepalm. This Alpha?"
9577,SO MUCH FUN
9578,"it is fun
Edit before i had 26 hours now i have 64 i am proud"
9579,"A very fun experience, definitely on par with Axolot's other games. The gameplay loop is repetitive and aimless at first, but the second the signal receiver is constructed, your objective is stated and the adventure begins. The mid to end game of exploration and darting from signal to signal feels extremely engaging and the puzzles fun and challenging. The narrative is simple, but still it keeps you hooked to find out how it all ended. There is so much to do, it doesn't seem as such at first glance, but there is, giving this game a surprising amount of replayability, throughout most of this game I thought I would quit playing it after I finish the main story, but here I am starting a third survival world so I can keep playing. Definitely recommended."
9580,bruce
9581,"Raft works best as a sandbox game where you collect resources to build improvements on your raft and progress to certain goals. I played this game single-player, so I can't offer any opinions on the co-op experience.

Now that the final update dropped, I'm a bit disappointed in the time it took between chapter 2 and the final chapter (aka chapter 3). I realize it's a small studio, but that's matters less when the game becomes a huge indie hit for the last 3 years. 

A lot of the story-line destinations heavily favored platforming and enemies that just regenerate once you kill them. I didn't like those elements as much as I liked the exploration and mini-game parts of these areas. These final chapter areas feel tedious, and it would have been nice if they added more technologies and craftables that can be used early on in the game, but most require require a lot of titanium which is not easy to get.

Lastly, this game involves constant resource mining and collecting. I enjoyed it while I was curious to see all that could be built and to create different solutions. The tediousness of it wore me down over time though. I never saw enough benefit to farming animals or plants because of how much additional work and frustration they took."
9582,"The early game in this just effing sucks. Really, really sucks. I'm guessing all the people who gave it good reviews, which is most of them, have more patience for pointlessly obnoxious BS than I do.

In order to survive your first day, you have to gather enough ocean garbage (whee!) to build out your raft a little, build a water purifier, build a cook fire, make several tools, and so on. After about 7 tries, I give up. You can't pull in enough materials from the raft to pull this off, so you have to jump in and swim (or get lucky finding barrels I guess) but there's a shark with nothing better to do than follow you unrelentingly just because eff you. So it'll kill you if you try. Then you lose 2/3 of what you're carrying. Avoid the water, and you won't get the materials you need and starve. IT. SUCKS.

I guess I could try an 8th or 9th time and build a storage container very first so that when I die I don't lose as many things, but honestly, think about how retarded it is to plan for and expect death in the first 10 minutes of a SURVIVAL game. 

There's probably a lot of game here, judging from the screenshots, but IDGAF. I'm stopping now while I can still get a refund.

It might suck so hard because they tuned everything for multiplayer and I was playing solo, but honestly, I hate that. Stop doing that, companies. It sucks. Detect that I'm playing solo and adjust accordingly."
9583,shark go nom nom
9584,very good game
9585,this game is fun and it so cool i really enjoy it!
9586,"Very fun, especially when playing with friends. Hard to understand what you're supposed to be doing in the beginning without googling. My friends and I took almost 6 hours to learn that there was a story to complete. Overall worth it and very fun, multiple 4 am nights."
9587,Is gewd
9588,After 115 hours of play time I Absolutely lover this game. It can feel repetitive at times going to the same types of Islands over and over again but in all honesty it is such a fun game. I do however suggest that you have at least 1 other person with you at all times as when you go down it can suck that you loose your stuff. It is also more enjoyable with 1 or more people as you can have 1 person focus on the wildlife while the others are gathering things to get items for the story line done or even just to gather materials to make stuff for your food and drinks.

9599,"I've not played many survival games (save for a decade of Minecraft), so I don't know how this stacks up against other popular items in the genre, but I dig it. The early game is tough, but the penalty for death seems fair (even fairer if you're playing multiplayer). It has that great element of ""just one more thing before I quit"" and so I recommend it if you're a fan of the genre."
9600,Good
9601,"It looks good. It sounds good. It's a boat load of fun (pun intended). I really enjoy just rafting around the ocean and exploring the islands. The story line isn't bad. But in the end it's maybe 3.5/5 stars. There just isn't that much to do, and after a while you have seen all there is to see and gone everywhere there is to go. If you can get it on sale, do so. It's worth it. Just don't expect to be able to spend 1000 hours playing it."

Raft is adorable, don't know about the shark wanting to attack all the time or the seagulls that love humping scarecrows.. 

I also, don't know about all the trash in the ocean, who's littering a bunch of stuff.  Also, Monstera Deliciousa should totally give fruit, but it's just a decoration.

The only drawback is the amount of food your character requires, if a person actually ate half as much as they do, the real person would end up weighing literally TONS in a week!!!  One twenty lb fish is equivalent to 3 bites, one baked potato is one bite, etc.... and that's not even bringing up the water situation! lol 
But still a great game!!!

9620,"""Boring"""
9621,revisiting this game after the latest update.  the game is fun enough and I recommend...however I think it needs some optimization as it causes my PC to run hot.  I can only play in short bursts as it causes my PC to throw out a lot of heat...I dont remember it doing this when I played it a year or so ago.  I have a pretty good gaming PC so if you have an older computer you may run into issues with overheating.

9647,"The story is boring, the combat still janky and the jump and run elements frustrating, because the game isn't well optimised for it.

Everything you craft breaks down too fast, even Metal spears will break after killing 2-3 enemies. Axes can cut down 5-6 trees before they break. It is frustrating, because you have to return to your raft multiple times when exploring bigger islands. The swimming gear breaks even when exploring the underwater area of one small island and is not worth crafting at all.

The concept of the Raft is brilliant though. It's a base that you will always bring with you and you steadily automate more and more.

I only recommend it if you want to build your Raft, If you want a good story or fun combat look elsewhere.

It also still has a few bugs and even though it is out of the Early Access phase, it feels less complete than Valheim.

Concept 8/10

9657,"very fun game, playing this will absolutely make me lose track of time! It feel like it's a lot funner to play with friends, and we get to explore the lore and the many many islands and enemies!"
9658,"With 509 Hours spent on the game so far, And current game progress being that my boat is parked outside the last dome city of Chapter 2 now going into Chapter 3. I can say this game is very rough early on with the major enemy always and forever, Bruce the shark. The Game is a non-stop grindfest especially in the early game and the plot and your purpose as the player can be extremely difficult to understand even with the [J] Journal and getting a Radio Transmitter Station up and running specifically to an upper level of your raft. And without a creative mindset for how to develop your raft without Bruce constantly blowing holes into it. It can be even harder to visualize a good size, good design, or good layout for a decent or even half decent raft. Planks being the #1 most used resource, used in literally everything and constantly having to grind out resources for the raft can be relaxing until you have to park at islands and start kiting bruce, the early game can seem extremely repetitive and grindy even just to get a scrap hook, or even a smelter or 2, and if you mess up big-time with a design-flaw with the raft you'll run out of scrap-metal and planks in no time. sometimes i wish the gameplay felt more rewarding or even had more of a constructive plot [like maybe an opening cinematic or closing cinematic] for the game, but when you start this game you pretty much get thrown into the frying pan. With only 4 tiles of a raft, a [J] for Journal, A plastic hook, and a shark with the objective to kill you and your 4 pieces of raft, leaving you pretty much Bewildered. Overall this game still get's a recommend from me and has a pretty nice community of players willing to help out on each others rafts.

TL;DR:
Pros: Game can be Relaxing and Casual With Progression feeling Rewarding depending on risks taken with the Shark [Bruce] and with peaceful mode this is even more factual. Normal mode is the best way to go about playing the game if you want to feel the thrill of risking all of your items and somehow making it or barely making it out alive or away from the Shark [Bruce]
Cons: Game can feel extremely grindy and repetitive and there is no contrast in the beginning or end of the game as for as story/plot goes even with a [J] journal trying to contrast said story/plot. In my honest opinion the game is missing alot of potential it could use to be much better with a better constructed story and same can even go for the combat system. I think this game tries to be all things but lacks in all things. Is the best way i can truely criticize this game."

9670,Such a fun underrated game.  The community on discord is one of a king who just help others. The game is really fun and really easy to get the hang of. I was a little hesitant playing at the beginning but got addicted to it in a matter of hours. I didn't play alone but rather played with my cousin which made the experience 100 times better. I would definitely recommend this to others especially people who love playing in groups or even alone.
9671,If you play with more than 3 people you will not only constantly run out of food but you will also want to tear the skin off of your skull from the sheer amount of discordance between the group and who owns what part of the raft. (people are evil)
9672,"Been playing this game since its early days, and I always find myself coming back to it, starting new saves over and over with friends periodically. There's always something to look forward to as you play. Gameplay is not too difficult yet not super easy-breezy, and I feel like it has a nice balance of everything (besides some bugs).
Definitely play w/ friends!"

9684,There's something magical about rafts. This game is amazing early and midgame however I highly recommend looking into mods in mid/lategame for easier storage/automation. When you get engines and electricity there begins to be an overwhelming amount of things to do to keep your raft afloat.

There are still a [b]LOT[/b] of annoying bugs, like when you kill a seagull and it's body/corpse is incredibly difficult to pick up; it bounces around and falls off the raft, even if there's things in the way that shouldn't allow it to fall off... Items sometimes fall through the raft floor, so don't throw things out for your friend to pick up... Also, don't die/faint while carrying an animal you caught, because apparently it disappears into the void.

All of that considered, I still recommend it. :)"

9734,"This game is an absolute joy to play. I've played a majority of my time with friends which has made for quite the entertainment. Having started in 2019 right before covid, I've seen the game go from decent early access product to a now full finished release and it has only gotten better over time. The early game grind (grind with a purpose) can be chaotic with multiple people all fighting for very limited resources to do stuff, while the late game get so rewarding watching everyone fill out their roles until you have a zero communication but fully operational raft with food being stoked, resources being collected, and someone collecting shark heads just because.

While I'm sad RedBeet has said this is the final version of Raft, with no planned DLC or content updates, I'm excited for their next adventure. In the meantime, I will be exploring new raft designs, achievement hunting, helping newbies in the Raft Discord, and enjoying in-game retirement fishing from the roof.

Is it worth the $20? Absolutely. I spent $1,200 building my first gaming PC specifically to play this game because my 2015 MacBook Pro struggled with the water physics. No Regrets."
9735,good game
9736,"Raft is a surprisingly enjoyable game that is more often relaxing than intense. The water world theme is brilliant as it could almost be seen a commentary on a future of climate change run wild, but I would guess the devs just wanted to make a unique survival game (likely taking some inspiration from the Minecraft Skyblock mod).

The story is interesting enough to keep you wanting to see what comes next, and the puzzles needed to progress through the story islands are relatively simple and don't take too much time to solve, but are still engaging.

The game runs smooth and looks good overall.

My biggest complaint with Raft so far is that without mods and other players the experience can feel boring and repetitive in a relatively short period of time.

9744,honestly I dont play many survivor games but seeing this one on youtube all over the place for the past 4ish years I decided it was time to give it a go and honestly I freaking love it; The only thing that is tad annoying is kiling the large raptor birds but they are a mini boss so its just how it is; The shark mechanics are hilarious so unrealistic and  cartoony; all and all i've been playing with two friends and we already started customizing our raft within the first 2 days trying to do the story line soon :)
9745,good game
9746,"""Meh"" is what it ended up being at 1.0. If you are the kind of person who plays survival games and enjoys finding and optimizing ways to beat the odds, this is not what they ended up making.

The initial game loop is somewhat unique and interesting. Resources pass you by and you have to balance collection, survival and development. However you get over that hump very quickly. There are upgrades you can pursue, but they are kind of meaningless and redundant. Once you have a basic raft, you are set, which is weird since the game was initially about raft survival. 

Then you get to ""explore"" islands you come across to gather more advanced resources to build more advanced tools and weapons that help you explore said islands. Similar to the raft situation above, you get to metal tools quite quickly, then stay with them till the end of the game, so that exploration is only meaningful a few times. Everything you do is balanced on the side of draining your resources, so you actually feel punished by exploring too much, like you didn't get anything worthwhile out of your trip. You just come back and need to remake the same set of tools that broke down super fast. Basically, you get a better outcome by minimizing exploration. And you are not missing out since all islands are the same.

Finally you have the ""main story"". I guess they decided the game was no longer about raft survival, but is now about seeking out other rafters to save them from the overtly evil man who captured them, but being doggy about it because there is no credible way to tell that story. So instead of having more complexity and depth on the raft building side, you get more awkward puzzles and clunky fights. 

It's a shame we won't see the initial concept be developed more.

9786,"Unfun, unpolished.
Don't bother unless you're playing with friends and got it on sale otherwise you're just going to have a miserable time.

The combat sucks, being incredibly barebones and having to fight against incredibly annoying enemy designs, like birds that fly around and drop rocks on you if you stand still but take too much effort to try killing.
The shark quickly just becomes annoying tedium that occasionally nibbles at you if you're too slow.

The puzzles are almost all horrible and dull, most of the time you just wander around the story island you're at looking for a few items to pick up to make a glorified key to unlock the next area and other times you get things like a sliding block puzzle or stacking boxes.

The story is awful and I just ended up tuning it out myself, the game felt like it ended almost out of nowhere.
Lacking resources at times when the islands are covered with them, I can understand not taking a whole door off for scrap but plenty of islands will be covered in large trees that you just aren't allowed to cut down at all.
Your character hates recycling. Drank from a glass cup? Had your soup from a bowl or meal from a plate? Used a bucket of milk to make a drink? Your equipment's battery ran out of charge? It's gone for good, no reusing or recharging, it's a wonder the player doesn't crush and throw away your plastic bottle into the ocean after drinking all the water in it.

Building is severely lacking, ladders can't be placed up against walls or float on their own so you can't have ladders trailing down from the top of your raft like a boat if you wanted. Destroying the wrong structure when renovating can cause everything on top of it to be destroyed instead of being dropped or placed into your inventory. Paint is applied sloppily on walls and leaves little strips where you can see the original wood underneath."
9787,love the game ^.^
9788,It's a fun game especially with friends!
9789,Great game but that's only AFTER you watch YouTube videos. You're thrown into a game with no tutorial and no idea what to do until you watch some videos. Would be a whole lot better if there was a tutorial on at least the basics of game mechanics. Another issue is hunger and thirst. In mid game I have to constantly stop to eat and drink that it gets to the point where you spend 75% the time being the only thing you do.

9794,"Yeah, nice game to chill out with friends. Never tried it alone, but i suspect it could be a tad boring considering most of the game is spent floating around aimlessly at sea.

Also, throw more plastic in the ocean, in the beginning it's quite tough to get enough to build your raft."

9803,"Raft. The game 6 years in the making. Can you believe the prototype was released in 2016? Which is no fault to it's creators. Can you believe only 7 people worked on this? It has been a journey. And every update has made it cooler and cooler. And since the final chapter came out, I figured it's time to write the review.

If you love survival games, then you will love Raft. Mostly the only other survival game I've played is Minecraft. And I think it's fair to say that if you like Minecraft, then you'll like Raft. Material gathering is non-stop, even with upgrades. And I always find joy when I craft a new weapon, or a new engine, or a new steering wheel, or a new anchor, or another new anchor. Progression is always fun.

It's fun to build your raft, and customize it. You can make a pirate ship, a floating house, whatever.

The story is great. Mostly what happens, is when you make a receiver, you go to where the radar leads you. Then when you get there, there are many notes and maybe even another human. You also receive more coordinates. And so basically you just keep sailing from place to place, learning about the people who lived there, and problems they had. And you may meet some animals along the way. Eventually you make it to Utopia.

It's fun. It's challenging, but not too challenging. So I think you should get it."
9804,"One of my favorite survival games of all time. It's fun as just a survival game in itself, but the story is also a lot of fun. Throw in a friend to play with and it's even more of a blast. At the time of writing this, I'm starting the Final Chapter and have over 100 hours in this game.

It has a ton of customization, secrets and possibilities for crafting & building. For $20, you're not paying enough!

$20 for 100+ hours in this game and I'm still having a lot of fun. I just hope that even though the Final Chapter is out that they will release DLC to add on to the story or maybe extra customizations or something. I'll definitely buy them."
9805,Played this game with a mate and it was a blast! Every aspect of the game just fits perfectly together.
9806,"survive Bruce simulator, we love bruce."
9807,"GOOD GAME!

Animal. 

it's a fun game that it good for relaxing, it can be a bit lonely to play through the story on your own, but it is set up well for multiplayer.

it can be very grindy at first but then it picks up and goes a somewhat fast, especially if you use a trawler boat like design,"
9808,"Played with a friend and immediately got hooked! Very immersive and fun so far. Some minus on bugs but they tend to ""fix themselves"" and rather just create silly things to laugh at."
9809,i named the shark poopen farden
9810,"I have two main thoughts about this game.

[b]1)[/b] It reminds me of Starbound, but with a much more functional gameplay loop. A very tedious, grindy gameplay loop - but it has one nonetheless. I can see reasons - not [i]good[/i] reasons, but reasons nonetheless - for even the most [i]asinine[/i] mechanics in the game. This is not really a point in the game's favor. It means that things transparently happen because it serves a meta purpose, rather than because it's a natural conclusion of the logic presented.

[b]2) This is the single worst excuse for a story I have ever seen in a game.[/b]

If you choose to pursue the story, you are - much like Starbound - guided to a series of isolated mission locations where you have to disembark your raft and suddenly do a bunch of unrelated things that have nothing to do with the game's core gameplay loop. This starts as basic platforming and evolves into tedious point-and-click gameplay where you have to find key items that allow you to interact with gates, with an occasional puzzle. From there, it goes nowhere. For the rest of the game, that's what you'll be doing. Find a key item, find the gate it goes into. It doesn't matter if the key is shaped like a crowbar, or if the gate is an engine you have to turn on.

It actually ventures into the realm of the absurd later on, when at one point you have two doors - one requires ""1 Master Key"", and the second requires ""1 Hammer"". They are secured with identical padlocks and neither are noticeably more secure. You get the hammer first, use it on the door, and smash the lock open. [i]Why can't you bring that hammer back to the Master Key lock and finish the only objective you're here for?[/i] God only knows! You can argue from the [i]designer's[/i] perspective, of course, but at that point you're arguing with the author and thoroughly out of the fiction itself, which rather defeats the point.

I don't mean to harp on the barebones key-gate tedium too much. All things considered, it is one of the game's lesser sins - it's just that hot out of the finale, it's first thing on my mind. Here are some of the other sins:

- [b]There will be at no point answers for any of your questions[/b] regarding the world, what happened to it, who the people you meet are, or what the organization you allegedly belong to is or means.

- [b]The characters are annoying stereotypes.[/b] You only ever get to know them through written notes. You get to meet some of them eventually as NPCs that only serve to dispense a few lines of dialogue.

- [b]None of the islands are unique.[/b] You will be seeing the same islands over and over and [i]over[/i] again.

- [b]Thirst fast becomes irrelevant,[/b] because fresh water is in abundance. This leaves it as an annoyance that demands you carry around a bottle for almost the entire game.

- [b]Speaking of annoyances, they compose 90% of the game's structure.[/b] Step into the water? You'll get bitten by the immortal shark that follows you around. Kill the shark? He resurrects in around 3-4 minutes. Your dinnerware made of solid clay is consumed along with your meals, which is not for technical reasons as you get your buckets back when you drink milk (unless used for a smoothie) - this is entirely implemented to force you to dig for more clay forever. Because otherwise, clay would be obsolete rather quickly. There's more like this - for example, jars (and therefore glass) get eaten when you turn honey into biofuel. For a game that seems to carry a moral about recycling, you're not really allowed to do much of it.

This is a game where you're encouraged to get [i]over[/i] most of these problems, but the solutions rarely solve anything, or just introduce more and worse dependencies. This is in some ways fine - because the developers needed to stretch out what they had for mechanics and a gameplay loop over the entire game - and in other ways infuriating, because it's responsible for most of the unending nuisances, and it means I actually [i]dread[/i] the idea of playing the game all over again.

""But,"" you ask. ""What about the story? What was so bad about it?""

It accumulates to nothing, essentially. That's what. In the end, the world is still a wreck. The caricature of an antagonist that harassed a bunch of off-screen characters in ways you'll only learn about through implausibly-scattered notes and journals left by off-screen characters turns up at the end of the game to gloat about nothing. He leads you through a series of irritating puzzles - most of which can be thankfully cheesed in multiplayer - and then, rather than actually fighting you himself, sics a Glowing One Hyena upon you. That's right, a radioactive mutant hyena, which he proclaims is the pinnacle of ""evolution"".

Also, throughout these puzzles, you get plenty of opportunities to land pot-shots on this guy. In fact, one of them involves stacking orange crates and cages on top of each other until you can reach the platform atop which he stands while throwing napalm grenades at you. This is an extremely tedious exercise that involves bunny-hopping around the arena, grabbing boxes, and moving them back over to near his platform, where you stack them up in the form of a set of stairs. Once you make it to the top, you're inevitably between him and the exit, spears and/or bows armed and ready, with nowhere for him to run. He solves this conundrum by phasing directly through you.

I didn't realize it until after this happened, but you could have just shot him with a bow from down below, in the arena. Fortunately, I got an opportunity to test this theory when [i]immediately[/i] following the above events, he leads you to a second arena identical to the first, where in addition to the fire-bombing, you get to dance around a pack of respawning hyenas while moving the boxes around. I took the opportunity to send a few metal-tipped arrows through the antagonist's body. I mean, literally through his body - because they phased straight through, no damage, no harm.

I am harping on the ludicrous scenarios the game puts you in because the gameplay during these parts is so barebones and tedious that there's hardly anything to [i]say[/i] about it. You stack boxes, you slide boxes. You spin wheels hooking up cables. There was one genuinely clever puzzle that I feel is worth both complimenting and mentioning: it's to do with an observatory. That one was A+. That was something brilliant that I'd expect to see in a really good adventure game. Which this is, unfortunately, not.

I don't recommend Raft, not at full price. Maybe if you got it at a steep discount. It kept leading us on until the end, but if I paid more than $5 for this, I'd feel ripped off. And I, unfortunately, paid $18."

9815,I'm not sure its just a nice little game to pick up and enjoy whether with friends or alone it's just a nice escape.
9816,really accurate ship driving sim. I was able to utilize the skills i developed such as reading radar and following the wind and tide to gain a local boat license for myself. I'm taking my boat out this weekend. out of the lake and into the sea time to really test my skills. 10/10 would recommend if you don't want to go to classes to learn how to drive a boat.
9817,"I would have recommended this game even before today, me and my friend have had so much fun playing this over its development, and it's in general just an amazingly put together game. The difficulty is marvellous on each setting, the shark is a nice enemy, the seagulls are extremely annoying... all in all, it feels very much like a journey across the open ocean.

And today, the reason I decided to put up this review, is because I found the option to turn off the massive waves rocking the raft, making me feel almost sea sick. Every game should have a motion sickness mode. Thank you devs! It means more than I can say! <3"
9818,"pp poopoo check
"
9819,"The game is very polished and runs well but the progression is entirely too slow for my taste and the constant shark becomes very gimmiky and gets boring/annoying fast. The world starts to feel very small once you realize that each island, while slightly different, doesn't offer much new entertainment except for the occasional new spot. Overall I believe there are much better games out there in this survival category."
9820,good game
9821,"Id love to see some expansions for this, but so far this has been a wonderful game to explore. If they ever make an under the sea game like subnautica I am going to throw my money at them."
9822,"Very fun game.

9823,this game makes me feel diabolical
9824,yea
9825,"This game came out of early access? Too easy, baybay!"
9826,one of my best friends bought me this game so he had someone to beat it with and i have a lot of fun on the multyplayer aspect of it
9827,"this game is an amazing multiplayer game, with an amazing story and cool game-play, i love that you can design your raft to exactly how you want it, i just wish they had more options for cooler ship stuff (ie. bigger sails, fancier anchors, etc)  but i'm overall impressed with the amount of stuff they have for building and just how much you can do with it, I've made a whole cruise ship.

resources are rather easy to gather and i love exploring all areas, I've owned this game before it even had large islands (or a story) and I've loved seeing this game grow into all that it is now."
9828,"The game is really nice, being amazing for multiplayer and single player. The story is interesting and the advancements you get from following it are amazingly worth it. The only annoyance is the shark; it can be really hard to play in a mode where you lose your items if you die because of how often the shark will attack you while collecting supplies underwater but overall, not too bad. I would highly recommend it to new and advance gamers. Very few bugs, I have only had one issue that lasted in all my games and I was able to write the mods about it. I love decorating and designing the raft as well, there's so many things you can do."

9836,ok
9837,"Before I start don't be fooled by how little time I have in the game, I launched through a github Exe which apparently steam doesn't recognise, anyway in total if you are progressing at a nice pace without too much difficulty and have a look at the few extras the game has to offer I reckon it probably tallies up to around 90-100 hours which is a good length, while I do think its a decent length for the game I feel as though some of this is down to artificial means like pointless re used rooms of enemies and my biggest gripe with the game, the sheer amount of bullet sponge enemies, Im not joking when I say that even on normal difficulty it can take up to 200 out of a 300 bullet clip to kill a single super battle droid with support from the 3 others in the squad, the game absolutely loves to throw these enemies along with a plethora of others such as the droideka and the spider tanks, these enemies have an absurd amount of health and they are often thrown at you in very large groups from spawning chambers, the worst part is you have to destroy these chambers not from afar but you have to blow them up by sitting beside all the enemies and holding E for 20 and I repeat 20 seconds, you will often get stuck cycling your commandos on this timer to run it down to desperately destroy it only to be met by another one immediately after oh yeah and enemies don't drop ammuntions so you are often left scrounging around for kills with your awful pistol which only adds to the ridiculous time to kill, now that I have my very strong feelings on one part of the game dealt with Id like to mention all the good this game possesses as i really do think Its a worth while play through, first of all I think the game does a really good job with immersing the player, despite the game being rather old at this point it still holds up to a presentable standard graphics wise without the use of many external mods such as the 1080x1920 fix which I feel is essential for current times, all the commandos look great and I especially love the incorporation of the hud into the visor, the multiple visor settings despite not being utilised all that often is a nice addition and is a cool gimmick at times for the few night vision sections, the commandos really do feel alive at times, the banter between Scorch and Sev over the comms really helps ground these characters into their world, like they actually know each other for a long time. The final thing Id like to address before leaving this review off is the ending, this game is plently old but if you want to spare yourself from spoilers feel free to leave now you have had fair warning, why and where the :hearts::hearts::hearts::hearts: does Sev go, we obviously hear him over comms briefly and he sounds distressed, but my immersion was really just destroyed when after mabye 10 seconds of arguing with the advisor on their orders to evacuate they just pack their bags hop on an LAAT talk to yoda for a whole 10 seconds and they roll credits, that was my biggest problem with the story, im assuming a sequel to the game was planned and mabye they would expand upon it there but unfortunately It may not have seen the light of day so we are left with this less than ideal ending. All in all I really liked the game and would suggest any and all raft fans to play it especially at its price point on sales"

9858,"This game is painfully boring and lifeless. Coming from real, fleshed out survival games like Valheim, Grounded, and V rising, and real underwater experiences like Subnautica, this couldn't be more bland. The ocean is completely lifeless save for a single shark that only exists as a blatant game mechanic to keep you out of the water. This isn't an ocean game, it's a protracted ""the floor is lava"" experience, where the ocean is empty, with even islands lifeless and untextured."

9868,"I've played a short amount of time (around 3 hours, and only in online), and i'm having real issues with the food and water, we always run out of food and water, and at the start if you're not aligned perfectly to find an island, you wont have enough materials to keep going and you will die on and on. Everything speeds up when you get shark meat, but slows down when you run out of it. The game is still really enjoyable and fun, and i plan on finishing this adventure."
9869,Best game ever
9870,Its very funny. But you should play with at least one friend. But even alone its a very good game
9871,The game is great one small issue THE RAFT KEEP GETTING STUCK UNDER THE FUCKING ISLAND
9872,"Game is gud 
me like game
you get game"
9873,"I like this game, i think it brings a lot of new concepts and thats great. But frankly its about as accessible as the staircase to a 10th floor apartment with no elevator. It's unkind to all players, with often adding needless tedium (like you eat bowls, glasses and buckets instead of re-using, which is ironically wasteful given the theme) and excessive micromanagement (everything is manual, no ability to automate.). This game also needs captions desperately. There's no way to know the shark is chewing on your boat unless you see him, and if you're impaired,  directionality is confusing as well.  RSI? Look elsewhere, so much excessive clicking, no batch crafting or processing in anyway. 

Do I like the game? Yah, but I can't recommend it when so many people (GAMERS) are disabled and this thing is in this state.  Message me when you add (enough) accessibility and I'll change this review."

9876,I love it when bruce bites my culo. 10/10
9877,"great game, but i think the placement of advanced items are a bit misplaced.

i like that i can get a 3 slot smelter, but when its at the tail end of the game (along with titanium tools... after i beat the final boss) i just don't see the point in having them especially since i was using 8 smelters to process ore.

along with the advanced items being their own thing, rather than using the old stuff within the recipe, stroked me the wrong way, in an O.C.D. kind of way, like ""i should be using them!""

lastly with all that being said, cause i was still receiving recipes after beating the game, i felt i should have had 3 more islands at east to use everything i created as apart of the final challenge.

i know game making is hard but my recommendation would be to adjust this so we aquire the recipes earlier like the electric grill and smelter as itmes from the yacht but then getting the blue prints at tangeroa along with titanium tools and the electric zip line tool, along with making certain items like the metal detector an early blueprint like the receiver and antenna.

oh!!

along with the bosses, since the final boss tripped me up being an actual battle rather than a puzzle like every other one, maybe mix in some points where you HAVE to battle the others so players know, to avoid that mix up?"

9899,"I bought this game in early access and played it only for a couple times. But since it was finally finished, I haven't stopped playing it. It is excellently done, and the main missions really add a fun atmosphere to keep exploring and building your raft. I would recommend this game to friends."
9900,"Although this game has taken long breaks between updates, it has been a fun and enjoyable game for me to play.  But as much as I enjoy running around collecting from catch nets and eggs from chickens and being over the top with my OCD storage, fishing and making food....... I do have a few mehs about the game based on other survival games I have played.

Normal mode may as well be hard mode if playing solo because you dont leave a death pack to collect, you just lose everything.... tho they updated this to 2/3 of your stuff - either way.... thats usually a hard mode thing and normally you usually get to go get your stuff back.  So play with someone who can save you (if you dont both die....)  And why cant we revive out crew mates? Rub some healing balm on their butts or have a sleeping bag we can throw down to 1 sleep at night if we are on the big islands and a fair distance from the boat and 2 to revive a mate.?????

Food and thirst drain like crazy even if you are just standing there.  Meals cost a lot to make and barely last and you still have to eat to fill the buff zone some give..... and now its worse since they changed the cookpot meals from 2-3 bowls to just 1!  Not a big problem but you do have to work hard to get the items for most of the meals.

I dont understand the end of the game.  We get all these new machines and upgrades but for what? its the end of the game...... things we could have used back before we hit the bear islands.  *confused*

I wish they added outfit options instead of new characters..... I  was looking forward to the customisation for characters but its just diff ppl and diff coloured outfits.  Can find and buy all these fancy hats but no outfits to suit.

The durability on things is lousy.  No repair option just break and make a brand new one and when you get to the metal stage its not always easy to get enough to make the better workstations and better tools especially when they are breaking so often.  And the upgraded machines... why isnt there an option to upgrade existing machines instead of making something completely new?  No option to break down old machines and reuse materials... just have to shove em in a box or toss them over the side.... oh wait.... put in the trash bin and delete..... HUGE waste of materials which you wouldnt do if in a survival situation.

Felt they could have done a lot more under water at the islands instead of in just one section while the rest was bare sand.  Sure they added sea life but minimal and rare.... I have seen maybe 2 whales in weeks and hours a day of game play.  A few turtles that turn up and disappear as quick as blinking your eye and a dolphin you might see randomly jump beside your raft before vanishing.

And we are on a buoyant raft thats meant to float..... yet if you are on the ground floor you can find your self fully submerged up to the second floor when the sea gets rough.  If this was real all our stuff would be washed away including ourselves...... 

But even with the meh side of it, i enjoyed playing it and hope that there are more updates to come so there was a reason for us to put the time into making all this new stuff.  Its a lot better with friends, especially in normal mode when you die and need reviving.....

9944,"Great, very fun 10/10"
9945,"Great fun either alone or with others.  I have built a raft from scratch and followed the story line half a dozen times as I just enjoy sailing around and building.  I have to admit I do most of my builds on peaceful mode so I can choose when I want the fights, but that's just my play style.  I appreciate that there are different modes for different play styles.  I do wish creative would actually let you move though as it would be fun to free form build something and see if it actually sailed correctly.  The Final Chapter was great.  The puzzles were challenging and sometimes frustrating, but doable even alone.  I did not complete the wind wheel jumping puzzle though and was glad there was a way around it.  Overall this game is a lot of fun!"
9946,Great game to play with friends. Love all the different things you can add to your raft to make it yours.
9947,This is a great game. I find my self coming back to it time and again.  If you enjoy open world survival I definitely recommend this game.
9948,bruh
9949,yes
9950,fun and chill game with a friend. would not play alone though
9951,so many options for how to approach play goals

If I think the game is good, it gets a 🌭Hotdog🌭. If it's not, it gets 🚫🌭Not Hotdog🚫🌭.


The game is ok, but it feels quite shallow (pardon the pun). Very addicting at first but the game becomes less stellar the more you play. The gameplay loop, while fun at first, leaves a lot to be desired. 

There are a few annoying small things that become more noticeable over time such as;

* No repair function/table for items.
* Bowls and drinking glasses are consumed instead of re-usable for some reason.
* There are non-plantable flora such as berries, mushrooms and chili.
* Plant seeds aren't always sustainable.
* Lack of variety of catchable fish, both small and large.
* Having to gather underwater with the hook instead of just picking it up with your hands.

The game really needs more balance in terms of durability and/or crafting cost. The hook and axe have 2 upgrades, but the fishing rod only has 1. Armor doesn't have any upgrades. Same with Flippers , Oxygen Tank and the Bow. The reason to have these upgrades, like with the Axe, is to increase the durability which, in itself, isn't balanced right now. Doesn't really make sense you can create better quality building parts (which does add durability as well as better aesthetics) but you can't do the same with other things such as the above mentioned.

You can create something as advanced as circuit boards and batteries but the available technology is quite primitive. There seems to be a fair few number of items that should be in the game but aren't. Solar panels, anyone??

The variety of islands is laughable and extremely lackluster. These really should have been procedurally generated to create hundreds, if not thousands of permutations. I have no idea why it wasn't, but I'm not a game dev of this engine. 

The trading outpost on islands is such a waste of potential.

Overall, ""Waste of potential"" is how I would describe this game. It scratched that Open World/Survival/Craft itch for a while, but the glaring omissions and lacking depth (I did it again) makes it frustrating to play and recommend. After 63 hours in about 4 days (more like 50 hours or so with the amount of time in the main menu or paused), I just lack the motivation to play anymore. 

Dealing with all (and I mean probably ALL) of the things mentioned above would greatly increase the playability of the game and they're basic enough things that I honestly feel like there really isn't a reason why they shouldn't be added IMO. Hopefully these things are addressed and 1.0 isn't the final content update.

I would rate the game more neutral than negative or positive, but steam lacks the technology to add that functionality to reviews.
I got my money's worth (15% off), but wait for a bigger sale I think."
9956,it was an incredible game
9957,"Firtst things first..... We have 2 very good PCs intel corei7 and a ryzon 5. and we have purchased the game on both PCs.
But since the 1.2 update multiplayer does not work anymore... Tickets get ingored... It needs to work for a game with this price.
But if we forget all that here is a review.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Grachpics: 3.5
Gameplay: 4.5
Computer needs: 3 (1 is a potato pc 5 is a nasa pc)
Multiplayer: 0
price: 2.5 (if you still want to buy it buy it at sale)
overall: 2.5

Hints to devs: Make multiplayer working again. and optimize the game a bit.

9958,game db tu dung mat world
9959,Such a great survival game. During my play through I wish I took more time to upgrade and build up my raft. really hoping there's more content to come. Would love more grindy content or rare items to find.
9960,"aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaamazing game with a few glitches the story isnt to prominent but its there plus really cool idea
"
9961,E
9962,"Great game, love me a bit of Raft! Needs some side quests though, I finished chapter 3 in not even 6-8 hours which sucked because I felt like it could have gone a bit longer. [spoiler] The additional tools you get once you complete it [/spoiler]  just felt like they were thrown in at the end, when they could have been obtained at an earlier date, which again wasn't that great considering you've progressed so far into the game to half like a tonne of new stuff implemented that just becomes useless and not worth getting (especially if you're a hoarder). Overall great game would give a 7/10."

9967,"I have been playing this game since it became available for Early Access, and I have to say, it has been fantastic the whole time but has also really come a long way in the last 6 years. The game offers not only fun and interesting activities and goals for you to complete, but also content that is relaxing and fun. If you want action, go find the major landmarks and kill a few ""bad guys"". If you want something to do that is functional but also allows you to read at the same time, go fishing off the edge of your raft. This game is fantastic and I'm excited to see what the future holds for it! <3"
9968,yes
9969,manky
9970,What an incredible game. You need to constantly maintain the resources and your vitals. That makes the challenging and super fun. You won't even know when time flies by.
9971,yes
9972,one time play game
9973,"Very, very good survival game to play alone or with your friends. I highly recommend if you wanna have some fun :)"
9974,"Super game, very relaxing, i recommended it !"
9975,very fun game to play with mr blind thief and mr bickycake
9976,"shark eat you, you kill shark"
9977,What i like about Raft is that it is a fun Open World game. That takes time to complete and there are many things to do. And the story is mid.
9978,"After playing this game since its first Early Access release, I would highly recommend it.  It has come along way, and it really shows in the content, and story.  It feels like an instant Classic, defining Ocean Raft Survival, for all copy cats that will come after.  

Funny enough, before I discovered this game, I had a vivid dream where my brother and I were floating in an endless ocean, on some make shift raft, drifting past the tops of skyscrapers, collecting garbage floating around.  When I saw gameplay on YouTube, I had that estranged Deja Vu feeling...  so perhaps you could call me Bias"
9979,Beautiful. Fun. An overall really great game to play with friends or in singleplayer

9981,"I love it. Option to play an ""anxiety free"" game or something a bit more challening, bit minecraft, bit sea of theivesy, bit of everything :)"

9983,awesome
9984,"Disappointed that nothing has changed since the last time i played back in 2019.
Only new stuff i see is furniture and extremely cringy audio notes.
And the blue Islands are still extremely boring and un-fun, all you do is run around clicking E on everything until the game decides you can proceed and gives you the coordinates for the next island, rinse and repeat."
9985,"Just love this game, start playing for a couple of hours then it's midnight, absolutely love it. So many things to do and it's great to see the results of building and designing a raft."

9990,"this was a cool game i ever played. I got adventure, survival, crafting and building experience by playing this game. And thanks for mention Jakarta - Indonesia in this game. As citizen of Indonesia i'm really glad to read it in the game."
9991,yes very good more fun with friends
9992,"Masterpiece. Did have to replay the whole game to get the ending due to a glitch at the end, but still amazing.

9/10."
9993,Great game for dedication and is generally a lot of fun
9994,"I would describe Raft as a (floating) survival builder, with a bolted on story to provide progression in build-ables. 
Its core, building your raft and surviving, is well implemented, everything else is... janky. 
Think Subnautica, both in gameplay and bugs.

It has a very PG story told over written logs and well acted voice lines, IMO you don't play this game for the story.

So it has flaws, but its a recommendation despite them, especially at its current price (£15 at time of review)."
9995,"I love this game I bought it recently and this game is so good when you have someone to play it with, great story little puzzle games and more. I love to explore islands and fight with enemies. I dont regret buying it. <3"
9996,Bruce
9997,need more plastic
9998,its a great game.
9999,great game recommended for new players to savivle games
10000,"You bring your base along in your scavenge/hunt so you wont get lost on your way home. A good idea since i always get lost in open world survival games. Not too complicated but some items and interactions are not properly explained, you'll need to test it in order to find out.




Not a fan of losing everything on death so I play on easy, a good decision considering what they added to chapter 3 of the story."

I couldn't careless how many friends you push away, I just want you to know I always had your best interest at heart.

Good luck making new genuine friends because you wont get that companionship from me. That's long sailed."
10010,x
10011,"I've just played this game for 12 hours straight today, and I would like to say this is a very good game. Me and my cousin did not realize there was such a good story with puzzles and everything you could imagine. I would recommend!"
10012,"play it now
wow"
10013,Addicting
10014,"The Negative:
1. The game is poorly balanced in multiplayer, resources are not scalable to the number of players:
- the resource spawn (floating debris and barrel) is fixed, players cannot go to different direction to gather resources because they are fixed to the home base (the raft)
- it's more difficult to feed/water 4 players since you need 4x the food and water and since the resources spawn at a fixed rate, some will go hungry/thirsty in the early game until you gather enough resources to build multiple water purifier/grill
- it's easier to defeat enemies in multiplayer: 1 player can be the target and just try to avoid the attack and the others will attack the enemy from other direction.
- some puzzles are way easier in multiplayer
2. Some connectivity issue: desync, lags, sometimes the hook does not update in real time, making it difficult to gauge when to throw it.
3. Endless blue ocean with little to no horizon in sight, can be disorientating to some players.

The Positive: good building system, even with basic geometric shapes, one can build creative raft/barge/ship, just wish there's a bigger sail so I can make a proper sailboat"
10015,very fin
10016,imagine castaway on a wooden boat but instead of Wilson you Have Bruce. And instead of being your friend hes stuck in an infinite looping purgatory of death and suffering.
10017,Good Game Survival
10018,Devs seem to have phoned in the final chapter and decided jumping puzzles and jankey combat with no actual closure to the story line would be a good way to push this out of EA.
10019,"*CONTAINS CRAFT-ABLE ITEM SPOILERS*

The game-play is great! Raft is a fun survival game with an interesting art style and fun building mechanic. I would love to give this game 5 stars, a thumbs up, whatever, but the enemies completely ruin the game-play. It takes forever to kill the shark hunting your raft, and a new one re-spawns within not even a full minute. Sure, armoring your raft keeps it at bay, but trying to explore underwater AT ALL is a pain in the ass. Three bites from that shark and you're dead. Even the armor you can make isn't that great. The enemies found on the islands are just as bad. It takes forever to kill a single enemy, and the damage they can do is obnoxious. When you play a game, the enemies should challenge you, not be straight up annoying. And every enemy, including the benign seagulls, are F!#*ing annoying."
10020,good
10021,good game
10022,This is a very good game. There is lots of content and the story line is long and engaging. I would highly recommend this game.

10032,It's Gut
10033,very nice game would highly recommend
10034,"[h1] Mads Bottom Line [/h1]

This is one of the better survival games, and I have not felt so chilled in playing a survival game for a long time if not ever. The graphics are beautiful, the environment is atmospheric, the motion of the ocean is great (apart from the Sharks) and the game play is smooth and balanced). 

In short, I love this game but be warned it can be very slow and gets a bit repetitive, but if that's your thing (it is mine), then you're in safe hands. Great graphics, blueprints, skills and actions will keep you wanting the next island to quickly appear.

10035,"I played up to the final chapter two player with my husband. It has been very fun. open enough to keep some mystery but semi clear goals. There were times that we just had no clue what to do next or where to go, but that kinda made it fun. 
Excited to start over and play through entire game now that final chapter is ready."
10036,boat  is big
10037,its really fun with other people
10038,Good game but really repetitive with all you doing half the time is going to islands getting recorces and then building your raft better but if thats your kind of game go for it i enjoyed 20 hours past that it was just grinding
10039,"This is a great family game that mixes the styles of minecraft and stardew valley. At first there doesn't appear to be a plot, but then going island to island you realize there is more than it seems. My favorite part is fishing."
10040,"The game is interesting, but I find it frustrating when you cannot repair your own equipment or spend hours going to islands to gather materials to keep making the same equipment (specifically oxygen masks and flippers)."
10041,"very fun game, has an amazing story. Highly recommend!"
10042,"I don't have anything bad to say about. If you know what to expect then there's no disappointment.

You just float around on a raft, gathering the resources to build it further from what is floating in the water, underwater near islands and on islands. While fending off a shark.

That's about the gist of it. It's a way to pass the time. Interesting idea for the type of game it is."

10065,"Way more fun with friends. But here has been my experience playing solo:

Pros: 
Unique Gameplay
Mobile Base Building
Feel like a Pirate sailing the seas
No forced PvP like Sea of Thieves
Addictive

Cons:
Repetitive soundtrack
Extreme lack of diversity in islands to explore
Clunky combat
Overpowered enemies (specifically the giant birds who drop rocks from the sky)
Hunger and Thirst loop is unbalanced (you have to eat about 30 times a day on Easy mode)
Decorative trees in a survival game? How stupid. Let me cut them down!
Enemies respawn WAY too quickly. Kill a bear, walk for 2 minutes, come back, there's already another one!
Super tiny inventory space. I find myself frequently dropping things I want to keep.
Incredibly poor controller support. No button prompts or controller layout ingame, and feels very wonky.
Very few mods for a game of its age

Okay, so I know that I listed a lot more cons than pros, but hear me out. This game is awesome. And there is not another game like it. Stranded Deep looks similar, but unless you can build a base from scratch out of your raft, I don't want to hear it!

This game also has a complete story, unlike most survival games. And though I have heard nothing but bad things about the story from others, I don't mind it. I love the usage of the Receiver, very cool! I believe there is a mod to add a compass and maybe even a map, but I prefer the receiver. And the notebook is a nice touch. The voice acting is pretty bad, especially the main villain. But I find it humorous, and in a good way!

All in all, worth checking out. But I recommend getting some friends to join you, because it can feel a bit too grindy sometimes. Get it on sale, and you won't regret it."
10066,"Great cooperative crafting/survival game.  I'm playing on Normal with two friends, and the challenge feels difficult but not overwhelming.  Because we're all stuck on this raft together, we're forced to cooperate in a way I haven't seen in many crafting games.  We're building an impressive raft and decorating it with all kinds of neat stuff, and I'm having a blast playing."
10067,"its pretty good, although i died the first time from an island despawning, that wasn't fun."
10068,ihuyo
10069,This game is very fun but... it gets kinda boring once you play for 6 hours straight.
10070,"I am a 45 yo father, probably one of the oldest people playing Raft. I am a single father to my Son, who is 15 now. My son got this game for Christmas in 2021 from his uncle, so we installed it on the family computer and he started playing. By the end of the week he had 24 hours on this game. This was horrible for me, as it was already hard for me to find ways to spend time with my son, as he is always out with his friends or just watching YouTube. So I decided to make a Steam account and get this game to see if I could maybe play alongside him. I loaded into the game, and started playing but I was stuck on what you where supposed to do. I asked my Son for help and he started a game for me to join. I loved it as it was the best time I had spent with my Son since my wife had died. This game has ever since brought me and my son closer again and now we actually spend time together outside the house together as well. This game reminded me that there's fun to be had in everything, and it has brought both me and my Son many happy memories."

2. Couldn't place objects anywhere.
3. Couldn't interact with objects (like using a cup on seawater, or placing a plank on the purifier).

10094,"I'm getting sick and tired of games being so lazy that they can't bother to teach you the basics.
OK great, I spawned on a raft. Can I move the raft? Seemingly not.
Can I grab the items i see littered around me with the grappling hook i have? Nope.
So seemingly all I am able to do (if this is incorrect, competent devs would tell their players what to do...) is jump in the water (and lose access to my raft in the process) and grab the items that way. So now i'm stranded in the water with sharks with no means to fight? Yeah awesome, thanks so much guys.
Let's also not ignore that the game's loading times (it is a 6GB game ffs) is absurdly slow: it takes longer to load than Elden Ring (no joke) and that game was so poorly optimized and even then, that game is 50 GB with recent graphics."
10095, soooo epix
10096,"This game is very fun to play, but it is way better with more people to play it with. Alone, it takes way longer to get the resources you'll need to progress and to manage everything at once. With others, it is a fun experience for everyone because there is always something to do and enough people to do multiple things at the same time without feeling rushed to get things done quickly. This game has a great story and is overall a great game."
10097,This game is super fun and has a pretty decent story line to follow. I like games where you have to build a base underneath you.

10099,good game

10107,"Best Co-op game on steam! Relaxing, puzzle, fun and hell of a story. Highly recomended."
10108,"chilll and fun, but so far id say that it lacks content, but for the price its a good game"
10109,"this game is really fun it was worth the money you guys should get it zero adds
"
10110,fun
10111,Pretty fun game... would buy it on sale if possible.
10112,fun raft game
10113,"Neat, but has conflicting game design and lacks polish.  

Lots of new items in furniture update don't have function. 
Simple things you expect to work don't, such as hitting a shark with an axe or putting water in an empty mug.
Shark is never expanded on, no events out at sea.

Doesn't feel like a 1.0 release yet."
10114,t
10115,"Amazing game! It has a great story line, great graphics, and many extreme challenges! I recommend Raft to anyone into gaming!"
10116,"I do not want to give this game a negative or positive review but in it's current state... I cannot recommend it.   I played the beta in 2020 and had fun.  The game had jank but it was good.  In 1.0 full release... there are more bugs and issues than ever before.  This game is 3 times the fun with friends but solo is miserable.  I've had the shark ignore needing water and just keep attacking me.  Falling through the world several times.  The punishment of loosing 2/3rds of your things is steep but with no ability to go back and get it just from dying from jank is too much.  A neutral option would be nice in steam but till the game gets better patches... just wait.

Pro - Decent survival game
Relaxing at times
Progression is fun at times
Story isn't bad

Cons - Bugs, too many bugs
Brutal punishments
So many easy quality of life items that could be done but instead, you gotta tear everything down to remake it.
Over agressive mobs
Stuff breaks so fast and after you get to the... 60% mark, you stop running into useful islands

Overall - This game had potential and still does.  In time there might be patches to address the jank in the game.  In it's current state I just don't have fun by myself.  With friends I can say go for it.  Also I heckin wanna punt that shark so hard..."
10117,yes
10118,"This game is amazing fun to play with friends. 


**Except for when your friends deceive you and play on their own and totally ruin the exploration experience. Looking at you Ryan."
10119,"good game , play coop for best experience !"
10120,"Achievement hunters beware, for this game has a good few very grindy ones to earn.
You will need to build and keep improving your raft, your home, in order to survive and tackle the new challenges the story throws in your way.
The devs are listening to the community. They are implementing their ideas into the game and are constantly making quality of life improvements to make things easier for the players.
Most of the time it's a chill game, so if you are looking for a game that you can enjoy without breaking a sweat, give this one a go."
10121,Very fun game! It's not as fun until you start progressing And I would recommend playing with a friend(s). But overall very fun!

10125,Nice
10126,GOOD
10127,I struggled getting into this game at first. It is a true survival game in the sense that you are told exactly nothing and just expected to figure out what to do. That's not bad...just something to be aware of. After I got going in the game I really started to enjoy it. I'd say it was about 30-45 minutes in for me to really get a grasp on what I was doing. I'm glad I stuck with it because the game is fantastic!
10128,8.5/10

10133,"Everything Stranded Deep should have been and more. 

It's difficult to create a living world in a video game as it requires attention to detail that many game designers lack. Raft is not one of them. Throughout the entirety of my playthrough both me and my 5 Year old co-pilot have been amazed at the tiny details the devs have added that have brought a feeling of actually being out in the ocean at the mercy of the elements. Some of this has been awesome (sitting atop the crows nest yelling at the thunder!) and some of it not so awesome (a devastated 5 year old as he helplessly watched his favourite pet Llama ""Llamis"" get washed overboard...

The musical score in the game is beautiful and varied enough that it took nearly 80 hours before we decided to lower the music volume a bit which I think is more than any game designer could ask for. Other in-game content is delivered at a wonderful pace allowing for a good balance of ""living"" and exploring. The artistic style is silly yet wonderfully creative, the main building blocks of the game are somewhat restrictive but the addition of the ""decorative plank"" works wonders, allowing you to go from simple lego block building to endless variations of building style (I won't spoil what the plank does, you'll have to play it).

A common theme throughout the game is ""simple is best"". The devs haven't bothered with the complex game mechanics choosing instead to do the simple stuff incredibly well. One thing that we both noticed was that as the game progresses and certain things start to get tedious or repetitive, the game introduces a solution to alleviate the tedium. Acquiring water for example became pretty tedious after a little while and as I was thinking ""bleh, I need to get more water already"", the game handed me the advanced water purifier. I can't list more examples without spoiling it but this is part of the pacing I mentioned earlier, very well done.

The storyline that you experience depends on what kind of player you are. I myself am one of those people that like to explore every nook and cranny and find all the easter eggs and secrets, as a result I worked through the storyline as a fairly slow pace and found most of the POIs that the devs have included. Those that rush through without pausing to develop their raft in between chapters might find it a bit shallow. 

Another common theme throughout the game is that you need to use your head to solve problems rather than just bashing your sword at things (a typically Swedish mindset I might add^^ ). 

It's not all good, there are some niggles :(

- Equipment that you make lasts about 3 minutes. We eventually stopped making things like air bottles and flippers because they literally only last about one or two laps around a big island before they break and the resources needed to craft them are not trivial to get.

- Armour is pointless. I ""armoured up"" before a big fight and before I'd even made it up the hill to the boss, the armour had been destroyed (maybe three fights with bears?)

- Pipes, oh god, the pipes. Devs, please fix the pipes so they can be connected to ceilings or at least, you know, turn corners lol. 

The bottom line?

A very polished game that has obviously been played to hell by it's own developers. It's worth the money and then some in my opinion. This entire review? All single player! Once you get your friends involved, then the chaos begins :)

Don't worry, Llamis had been luckily (and inexplicably) ""rescued"" by daddy by the next play session ;)"
10134,game very good highly recommend yes yes download buy even if you must waist you collage funds (dont do that iam just saying its a good and fun game)

10141,you are shark dinner and on boat very good
10142,the game it self is amazing
10143,its very fun but dont put it hard mode
10144,I like this game mainly because of how it works its just kinda like an open world game but has a story line I like the story line because its not just following one path its like playing a game to where its open world and story line mixed together you can go off path discover new things people you can play as so many different things the more and more I play the game I am like okay do I like this or not indeed I do I play with friends a lot which is more fun but single player still is fun to me also.
10145,Game is very fun to play with friends and finish the story line!
10146,"good games
gooody"
10147,Cool Game
10148,36 hr. of play time. Totally worth it. Recommend to play with 2-3 friends. One of the best co-op survivals available
10149,"Radio signals being your only guide for navigation makes you potentially miss the larger islands that have the fabled new content slated for chapter 3. The ending was just terrible and such a letdown, really a guh?? moment."
10150,"Really fun game, endless hours of making your raft a nice place and a cool story that takes you to many different places"
10151,"This game is packed. Filled with adventure, and infinite creation. you can fight bosses, discover the story line, have peaceful moments on your custom raft. there are even a lot of amazing things you can make. I love this game with all of my gamer heart. I hope that others can enjoy this master piece, this work of art, loving game."

the only negative I have and a bit of a spoiler alert

death is not punishing enough... maybe cebuzz i have it on easy."
10159,forced to stay up late playing this
10160,survival games are plenty but this is a decent one in middle of ocean with friends or SP you can extend your raft and learn new things with a story line.I recommend this
10161,NICE
10162,HOOK WOOD SHARK BITES RAFT HOOK MORE WOOD EPIC 10/10 WOULD MAKE WHITE PAINT
10163,"Its fine I guess, but missing the weed tho"
10164,"This is my third draft of reviewing this game, this version covers the highs and the lows of the game. There are a lot of pros to this game, such as it works really well playing with friends, there's tons to craft and every single item you get in the game all the way up until the end has a purpose. The upgrade system is fantastic and all of the upgrades come as very well earned rewards. By the time we found a different purifer that didn't require wood it was such a relief for instance. The game does a really healthy job at spreading out these types of rewards and it knows how much time it takes to build up resources to play the game well. The fact that there are various tiers of these upgrades is fun and rewarding as I said.  The review has a thumbs up, but I wish I could put a level inbetween yes and no, but it is more towards a yes. But on to the cons. A lot of the game is difficult to manage in first person, such as the platforming. None of it is impossible, but some of it is harder than it should be, like jumps and melee combat. The snow world glitched on my friend and I to the point where we almost gave up on the game altogether. We had beaten it, the game froze and crashed and then we loaded in about 30-40 minutes before where we were during the crash. We loaded in an instant-death type room. The snowmobiles controlled very awkwardly and were especially hard to drive in 3rd person. For the most part though, all of the puzzles are pretty solid and the game has you using everything you learn in the campaign constantly. I loved Raft for a long time up until I was soured in the snow world. Building and customizing our raft was so fun. Exploring islands and dungeons with friends was a blast. The variety in the levels were top notch. The game  is clearly meant for someone who loves survival games and is very well designed  and planned. There are some very real decisions that make the game not play as smoothly as it's planned, but ultimately it was fun, the story was interesting, and my friend and I had a lot of fun playing this together, even through the bad times."
10165,JUST FUN
10166,good game
10167,cool
10168,"If your into survival games and want to blow off some steam with a game, Raft is for you. And with the price it has Raft is absolutely worth the pay."
10169,IT FUN! Thats all ya need to know!
10170,after playing 61 + hours come to realise the game isnt as long as it could be saying that still love the game and have had a few playthroughs would highly recommend
10171,buy it
10172,Is a good game!
10173,beans
10174,"Pretty fun game for what it is but has a few caveats to be aware of. It can be pretty grindy at times, but it keeps you relatively busy and on your toes at all times. I also don't know if this game would be great for a solo player, since you have less hands to work and lack the option of being carried back and revived from being incapacitated which me and my friend have made liberal use of.

Beyond that though, I think it's an excellent game that delivers quite well on the survival experience. There's plenty of fun problem solving when it comes to the main storyline and watching your raft grow from a little bit of wood to a full-blown houseboat with attached workshop is quite a sight to behold."
10175,"I bought this game twice. Once to play myself, and once for my wife's account so I didn't have to respawn and lose 2/3's of my stuff.

Worth the money both times. This game is a masterpiece--and I didn't lose any of the T3 fish I was omw to sell. 10/10."
10176,"The game itself is interesting. I like the gameplay and story, but there are things that could be better. 
The story could be a bit longer and some things remain unexplained. I feel a bit unsatisfied by the story.
Still, Raft is a very good game.
8/10"
10177,"Definitely better with a friend.  The game shifts from oh-shit survival to dope base building as you upgrade and discover.  Game is clever and well done, I enjoy it!"
10178,Recommend it.
10179,this game is awesome and its so much fun with friends
10180,very fun
10181,"I am not a fan of survival games, but this one, whoa! I fell fast and hard for it, absolutely love this game.
Very addicted to it (in a good way, no lives were ruined).

Love that there is just an option for building and one for hardcore surviving. The best thing is the co-op, it is fun, challenging and entertaining! I wish there were more pet options, maybe a dog or cat companion?

11/10"
10182,I really like this game. It is an open world (multiplayer) survival game. It is very fun and very very much worth the $20 I bought it for.
10183,Its a good game
10184,gg game
10185,"me likey

10190,"If you ever wondered what it's like to live alone in a desert where you get everything your heart possibly desires given to you, you don't have to solve any puzzles, hunger and thirst aren't a thing, and you have a cool shark pet named Bruce that never wants to eat you or your humble abode, this game isn't for you."
10191,"No effort went into this game. Start with a farm (net) that will capture low grade resources and that's it. No other automation in the game, That means every upgrade is actually a downgrade considering all the better resources must be gathered manually.
 You will spend an hour gathering food to survive exploring for 5 min. Eating a full meal every 2 min. is the only way they could say the game has more than a couple hours of gameplay. Yes, it’s that empty.

Only people who desperately need content for a youtube channel will ever finish this massive grind for no reward."
10192,"Good survival with steady progression and a decent story.
Would definitely return for DLC or Raft 2 in the future"
10193,"I have played this game in several stages of its development.  As I have seen the game grow it has gotten more complex and more interesting over time.  Now that it is finally finished and the story is complete I recommend that you try it.  It can be a fun game on your own or equally as fun with friends.  

If you like survival and base building you will probably enjoy this game.  My best advice is to build the new items you get along the way as you unlock them and not to skip or ignore the new technologies and tools you find.  The game tries to move you in the right direction slowly by having you build new and more complex stuff as you progress.  

Give it a go.  Drink water!"
10194,"Very fun and good game! Played through it once all the way to Tangaroa with my wife ( this was before the last update) so that was were we left our first playthrough, it was a great. We had a ton of fun exploring around, building up our raft, farming and catching animals! 

We started a new playthrough once the new update dropped which added the final chapter, I will say that playing through some parts of the game were not as fun, mainly places like Balboa, Caravan town and Tangaroa BUT once we got past that again it was a ton of fun exploring all the new places! The last boss fight was also quite fun and challenging. 

also who doesn't like chomping down on like 5 whole watermelons because you forgot your water bottle?"
10195,"One of the most aesthetically pleasing survival games out there. Not only is it pretty to look at, but it's also very fun to play (especially co-op). The missions are fun and differ from each other, the use of tools and research is also cleverly done. 

10/10 would recommend playing this with your buddies. Especially if you're going to jump into the water to collect plastic (because it's always the darn plastic that you're missing) and need to decide which one of you shall get a bonding session with Bruce."
10196,"Probably one of the most fun survival games out there, definitely not hard by any means but it's perfect for a small group of friends or a duo to play through. I think it can get quite grindy and tedious as a solo"
10197,"mug
"
10198,good game
10199,"This is an overall great game and perfect to play with friends.  You can loose yourself in this game for hours and not even realize it.  You can dole out roles to everyone and it is just a blast.  Everything is great, except for Bruce.  Bruce you beast, just give me a break!"

10221,Its a very fun game
10222,"POSSIBLE SPOILERS: 

I actually LOVE this game. Hours pass in what seems like minutes. Nearly everything is done brilliantly and in such a satisfying way. When they brought out the 1.0 update I was SOOO excited. Unfortunately there are a couple of gripes that lead to my ""negative"" review. Apart from little annoyances such as the recycler having to add 1 item at a time and having to spam the ""E"" key,  adding the titanium too late to the game, kinda, I was at the last location before realising you could dig up titanium ore and some other little gripes. My main gripe is the ending/last location, it just doesn't seem like ""Raft"". I always liked the idea that there was never anyone around and you were always searching 1 step behind others, then they introduced random characters at the end of each location, but the last ""boss"" was just rubbish, the puzzles with the gears was just annoying. Everything up to that point was brilliant, but that ruined it for me. I had saved up a huge bunch of materials to do a big fancy build of my raft but the ending just makes anything after so pointless.

Hopefully they bring out more, such as DLC or something and I can go back, but as it stands, the ending ruined the whole experience and I would have preferred no ""boss""."
10223,very good very nice
10224,it is a fun Survival game
10225,"The gameplay loop is enjoyable once you get past the initial resource drain/learning curve.  However, at this time there exists a bug in this game where, to avoid spoilers, a certain critical and very resource-expensive component of your raft just simply disappears. There is no mention or acknowledgement of this bug by the dev team that I could find (i could be wrong, i just didnt see any on their support page or steam forums), and unless it is fixed I simply cannot recommend this game. Seriously game breaking for me as its not only extremely frustrating to have to replace this thing every couple of hours but the lack of acknowledgement and/or remediation is  really disappointing.  I was looking forward to finishing my playthrough but after the last time my ship part mysteriously vanished I cant seem to bring myself to care anymore.

TL:DR - game breaking bug not being acknowledged/fixed by devs makes the game quite unenjoyable. Wait to purchase until its fixed."
10226,this game sucks
10227,My game keep crashing!!
10228,so fun you are on eh raft  you cant play whit player
10229,"Honestly, this is the best game I have played on steam. It is fun, each day it feels I am doing something new, the multiplayer aspect make it 10% more enjoyable. If you are on the fence, get off the fence and buy it."

10235,"Beautiful graphics. Plays very good only got a very occasional and very minor bug here and there nothing that breaks the game by any means. Very addicting, great time waster."
10236,"A fun little builder game with a neat little story. I got it for £12 and already got 21 hours out of it and got stuff left to do! If you got some people to play it with it's one of the better coop survival games that offers something new rather then big giant island now go build stuff.

Some minor bugs but the devs do seem keen on fixing them as they occur."
10237,posranej bruce sežral mi dvě bedny chápeš obě dvě zároveň takže nemám ani kundu prostě totální dickhead fakt mě sere doufám že zakopne a zlomí si malíček
10238,I really have enjoyed playing this game. I have had it downloaded for a long time and I'm always excited for new and added content. I think the devs have made a great balance of surprise and excitement to offset the grind. I have had a lot of fun playing for sure.
10239,Its one of my favorite games and i just love the realistic/cartoony graphics
10240,"op but the story is kinda hard to find
took me like 10 to get to the first story then it goes fast.
much better than before
"
10241,Please add DLC or something!!! This game is too good to be finished
10242,"The game met me super randomly. First time I played like 30min or 1hr. And I don't know somehow I couldn't play actually didn't have time to play and eventually forgot the name of the game. But after a year that game came up to my mind suddenly. I searched every name that came to my mind to find out what is the name of that game. Finally, I found it, I guess after 3 or 4 years, I was able to play this game. 

I super enjoyed especially the first time when I knew this game actually has a story, I'm surprised.

So I decided to play with my two friends along and finish it but due to university exams, we couldn't. But for me, I'm still playing Raft. I'm so excited about what comes as the next chapter. I mention especially here that devs did well. 

10/10 no regrets. Raft is so amazing. 

I love this more than other survival games XD"
10243,Let me drive the boat
10244,great game
10245,after playing for 5 mins i was reminded why i dont play crappy survival games..... zero fun and just plane boring .......
10246,good game
10247,"Built from EA, added more and more content.

Solid story, good mechanics.  Even more relaxing with friends but can get tense when dealing with larger critters, especially alone.  Though Bruce is no longer a concern."

10256,up
10257,Yeah
10258,"Absolutely a brilliant game! I really really love this way of crafting your own raft. The storyline is nothing special but it's good.
The best part is the ability to do multiplayer with friends - nice and chill experience!"
10259,Nice Game !!
10260,very fun to play. good storyline!
10261,Great game im gonna keep playing it
10262,One of the BEST survival games
10263,"""One of my favorite ""survival"" games. Very relaxing once you get the hang of it, with a pretty tense early game (if you are playing solo) just to gather resources, learn what does what, etc. After that its all raft-building and managing really. Reinforce those raft parts and forget about that shark later on, huzzah!

Don't expect a ton of challenges, but the story itself is nice and interesting, with quite a few cool places to explore and bits of information to discover. 

Great game for what the developers intended, definitely recommend it!""

That was my original review, but after playing the ""final chapter"" I can't really recommend it anymore. The game goes from a tranquil survival game to a pretty poorly done puzzle / platformer  experience. Pointless mechanical boss fights? check. Horrid puzzles and sketchy jumping?check. Up until the final chapter it was an enjoyable game."
10264,"As the designated fisher for my family, i was very disappointed to learn that the chair that my friend made was unavailable to be sat on for fishing."
10265,Very fun and relaxing game.

10292,"This game is extremely fun if you bring a friend along with you, and even alone I don't think my experience would've been that bad. I knew nothing about this game before buying it, but Its simple enough that you don't need any prior knowledge. Overall its got quite a lot of content for $20, and if you buy it during a sale then I would say its definitely worth it."
10293,Very fun this 7 hours i play was in one day!
10294,"Raft is a survival crafting game and, like so many in the genre, has a fun early game, stumbles in the midgame, and falls flat by the end.

Raft's central premise is that you are a person stranded on a raft in the middle of the ocean, and the early game sells this perfectly. There's nothing around you but blue sea and the garbage floating in it. You have nothing to help you except for a hook made of trash and the four pontoons you're standing on. And you have the constant threat of death, both from lack of food and water, and from the ever-present shark circling below your raft.

So you start hooking garbage. You learn how to make things. You protect and expand your raft, you fix damage, you navigate, you learn to survive. You have fun, in short. Eventually you bump into islands, find new components and crafting materials, and the complexity of what you can make expands. Soon you can sail to the islands you choose to, and that's when you enter the midgame.

The midgame of Raft consists of travelling between story islands (rather than randomly encountered ones), exploring them, and collecting the tier 2 materials and recipes found there. This is where the cracks start to show, both in story and gameplay. The setting - that the entire world is flooded to the point where only a few skyscrapers and islands show above the water - is already ridiculous, and the characters and behaviors that exist within that setting are, frankly, silly, but we'll get to that in the endgame.

It's the gameplay that begins to be a problem. In almost all survival crafting games there is a rule: as complexity increases so to does automation. This means that, as it takes more complex and rare items and materials to craft the next thing, the previously made things become easier to make, often via automation. This stops the player from feeling overwhelmed; it's very easy to lose track of what you need to be collecting and when, especially when equipment degrades with use, so automating low-tier items helps prevent that.

Raft has zero automation, and everything you equip degrades constantly. This is [b]exhausting[/b]. You can set up automatic collection of tier 1 materials, but no there is no automatic crafting to replace broken equipment, and neither tier 2 or 3 materials can be collected any way but manually. Moving into the endgame and tier 3 recipes and materials is where this issue really shows.

Tier 3 ore can only be found with a metal detector. Islands have either 1 or 2-3 metal detector areas within them. You only have a 50% chance of even finding an item that can be tier 3 ore with each dig. You need dozens of ore to craft the tier 3 equipment you'll need. Obviously, this takes an absurd amount of time, but the truly painful part is that, while you're searching for it, all your other equipment is actively breaking, meaning you still need to manually collect all the tier 2 materials [i]and[/i] manually craft every single thing you need.

It is literally not worth your time to bother.

Thankfully, you don't need tier 3 equipment to finish the game, but sadly the game ends with a wet fart. The climax the story is building to, the culmination of years of development, is a villain who is angry that people turned luxury apartments into living quarters and farms. [b]Yes, you read that right[/b]: the final boss of the game takes over the last human settlement and jails everyone because he is mad that luxury apartments are being used to keep humanity alive.

This is, of course, meant to be a commentary one greed and shortsightedness, etc, but it's so pathetically blunt that the message simply doesn't land. Not helping is the fact that this final boss has a northern European accent that is so ridiculous to hear as an english speaker that all his threats just sound hilarious. He literally sounds as if Goldmember from the Austin Powers movies was threatening you with death. That'd be fine in a comedy, but Raft takes its setting seriously. 

It's just a really, truly pathetic end to the game.

All told, Raft is very much a mixed bag. It absolutely nails its ridiculous setting, especially in the early game which is very fun, but the mid- and end-game gameplay failures make it a chore to finish, and the story being completely unimpactful doesn't help. 

I still recommend it, but not unreservedly.

P.S.: Raft has an active modding community that has worked hard to counteract some of the criticisms in this review. If you do pick up the game, make sure to check out the great work the community is doing."
10295,"This game is not worth buying. Very hard, very boring, slow game. Not even fun."
10296,"I definitely recommend this game to anyone that enjoys open worlds that includes survival and surviving from scratch. There's lots to build and discover. My favorite part about this game is that you can play it with 8 people on one game. Options to play from creative to hard, first person view and third! A very affordable game for what it includes and if you enjoy building this game is great for that!"
10297,"fun with friend boring alone unless u like grindy

10302,wonderful representation of how much the ocean is polluted.
10303,"Not for people with ADD. Every time you want to do something, there's 10 steps before you can even start, but WAIT, there's the shark! there's the bird! oh no you're hungry! you broke 3 weapons but finally killed the shark? it comes back in 2 minutes. you don't get anything useful until after it's no longer needed. the best stuff only becomes available once the game is over which doesn't make sense to me.  

great game to experience playing."

10310,Amazing game to play with your friends.
10311,vry good
10312,One of the only games that actually fits the survival genre imo.
10313,"I love this game.

Another in the line of light survival/crafting/base-building, it has exactly the right mix of relaxing resource-gathering, as you gather wood and plastic and such from the water while fishing for more food, expressiveness as you build out your boat to make it look nice, and discovery, as the game makes sure there's always something new to tech into, expanding your list of recipes so you can continue to explore.  And, of course, you can play with your friends."
10314,"FANTASTIC game, play it with my spouse we both really enjoy the game, sadly once youve finished the story of the game kinda feels pointless to play more, hope they add some sort of replay-ability"

Worth the money and would recommend to almost anyone"
10323,Raft is a must buy to play solo or with friends!
10324,This game was great!
10325,"This game is super fun to play with a friend. You coast around on a raft and gather materials to make your survival easier. If anyone has ever played The Flame and the Flood, It's sort of similar (you don't have a dog, but you can get animals later). Just keep a steady supply of food and water and build everything important (grills, water ect) in the middle of your raft so Bruce the shark can't mess with them. When your raft does get damaged, be sure to repair it."
10326,"Buy this game!!! 

I have thoroughly enjoyed playing through Raft, we are close to the final island and the end of the story but this is a game I will work towards getting all of the achievements (some are so grindy, 50 angler fish really and 365 days in game)! 

It is great game to play with friends but even fun and doable playing solo! It's been amazing to go from the beginning of the game screaming in sheer terror whenever Bruce would attack my 2 square raft, to eventually being able to attack him with a wooden spear, then eventually a machete, and now I don't even worry about what he is doing LOL I just focus on the other dangers of the game, the story, decorating our three story raft and exploring the sea!

Please make some DLC or Raft 2!"

10333,"This game scratches so many ""good game"" itches. The gameplay is seamless and fun. Its got a cool story to tie it all together. The art style is great and matches the themes. There's plenty to do, and goals to achieve all throughout the game. On top of all of that, its REALLY fun to play with friends!!!"
10334,The Forest with more sharks. Main story islands are pretty interesting to explore

10338,Raft is a game where you float with friends yell and take each others potatoes fuck you this game gives me nightmares. NIGHTMARE NIGHTMARE NIGHTMARE. OH FUCK HOLY OH GOD. Raft is a game where you float with friends yell and take each others potatoes and steal their house hold valuables such as a shoe. fuck you
10339,"I can't understand why people have given this the thumbs up! My son and I spent 5 hours playing and we could barely survive. You spend all your time looking for food and we were on easy mode and peaceful mode! Not very enjoyable to play. We even had steak and it barely filled our food bar. I would have to eat 10 items to fill the food bar. Any of the barrels that came our way had no food in them. We had to go on the islands to find food. Not what it advertised!  The tools you can make don't last very long, so you are constantly having to remake them. You would have to do this game in creative. The opening picture show a peaceful raft, but ours had water running all over it. Not fun at all!!!
After u-Tubing about the game I found out you must get a fishing pole!! I still don't understand why the makers of this game thought you need 8 planks and rope to make 1 spear. Stupid!!! I mean where is rope on a spear??? If my son wasn't helping me I would have quit the game by now. Thank goodness for u-Tube!"
10340,good game. good with friends or to relax and enjoy the sea

10343,it is good and cool raft game
10344,its a game
10345,Chill and fun
10346,"So...this game is great. It is also repetitive but keep in mind this is an ocean survival game. 
I have yet to complete the main story however I am thoroughly enjoying Chapter 3. It is relaxing and really gives me the feeling of kicking my feet back in the sand. With that being said, I'm off to finish the story and expanding my raft!"
10347,let me drive the boat :)
10348,"Enjoyed game very much
"
10349,"Raft is pretty niche. It can be enjoyable at times but most of the gameplay is boring and slow. Raft feels like it's built around multiplayer than single player. It leaves me with a sour taste. If you ever play this game you will have a better time playing with just one other person. Playing this game solo is incredibly boring.

I will say that the concept of the game is really good. Stuck in the ocean with only yourself and a raft is a very intriguing concept and how one will get out of that situation but my main gripe with the game is how the game is solely based on the story progression and how it detracts from the ""open world experience"". Great concept but bad execution.

The base game is that you are stuck on a raft and it moves through a endless ocean. There are resources you can collect in the ocean and you can also find islands to explore with resources. No matter where you are at in progression you will still never have enough resources, you will have a easier time getting more in late game but you will always be out for more. Raft is ""open world"" but the exploration isn't exciting at all once you realize all of the islands are identical with the same resources such as flowers,trees,fruit and metals. The combat isn't good at all and feels very clunky, the hit-boxes on enemies are awful but combat isn't the main focus so I'll let that slide.

There are several gameplay loops, and most of them are trying to keep you engaged. Always needing to eat and drink, This gets easier to control later in game but the food/thirst drain declines too fast. There is also a shark that will be around your raft and even if you kill it, it will re-spawn in like 1 min. It will also attack your raft. At first this doesn't sound too bad but it's just another annoying gimmick to annoy you and keep you occupied.

Overall, the story feels disjointed. It's a series of islands you go to pick up a note part of the story. Once your done with the story there is like nothing else to do. The newest story addition features puzzles and 2 bosses, that are way too tedious and boring. Most of the new locations didn't contain anything interesting. Disappointing...

In short, this game fails to bring a good experience. It is too tedious and lacks any sandbox elements that are fun that much better survival games include. Most of the gameplay will be struggling to the endgame and even 10 hours later you will still need more wood. If you like spending a eternity waiting to drift to an island for some sand then consider this game. It's more enjoyable with friends but it still lacks gameplay elements to have the motivation to play."
10350,its a great game has alot of fetures and a lot to do in it i have been playing for 9 hours and i havent even completed the first chapter

10360,Game is very fun throughout the complete story. However the ending was a complete disaster. It was terrible and ruined the whole game. There is no purpose to the game after the story in regards to side quests...
10361,this game is a slow game but vary cill game for when you are bored and you can play with your friends or play solo if you have no friends but the discord is nice for someone to play with
10362,"Game overall is very good, ending........shaking my head."
10363,"Survival crafting game about living on a raft in a flooded world. It mostly takes place on this raft which you build up yourself, but you can also stop at a bunch of locations. Pretty fun, but there are some annoying things about it. Particularly, there are some mechanics which cause some repetitive gameplay, and the exploration of some locations can be a bit annoying. Still, it's a fun game, especially with friends."
10364,Loving this game!!!
10365,"its bad, it feels like it enjoys wasting my time."
10366,yes
10367,"Fun, but the speed at which you can beat it at makes the price not worth it. bought to play with friends and beat it in 24 hours of game play underwhelming. the story line/lore needs to be extended other than that. Fun survival game to play with friends."
10368,I love this game
10369,"Pretty good. Early game can be monotonous, especially single player, but there's some fun moments."
10370,The survival aspect isn't too frantic or grueling. The combat isn't very heavy or difficult. The story and related activities are interesting and fairly intuitive. A bit more tutorial info would be useful. But the game is fun and light and reasonably relaxing. Like a way-scaled-down ARK.
10371,good
10372,great game really good story line so far better with friends but can be played solo
10373,"In my pursuit to make more metal bars I added a smelter on the edge of the raft, my friend warned me of sharks biting it and destroying takes the smelter with it. I ignored those warnings. But my hubris was not enough for reality to sink in...we lost that smelter...and I set our production speed back about 6 dry blocks...my friend...furious, jumped out to the see to allow the shark to eat him...I was alone on that raft...to think about what I've done.

10374,its really good a bit of lag but other than that its a really good game
10375,cold
10376,the slayest game to ever exist
10377,"I finished this game back in Early Access in 1-2 days with a couple of friends.

Haven't touched the game till the new update.
Replayed it now again with the finale and really enjoyed it again!

Very fun co-op game."
10378,"It's a game like this that makes me really wish Steam had more options than ""Yes"" and ""No"" recommendations.

I would absolutely like to state first and foremost that Raft is a great spin on the standard crafting/survival game. The game initially is also very well thought-out: you are on a raft, and must collect resources (basically garbage) to improve your raft and survive. Without spoiling too much, massive climate change has changed the world and that's why garbage is so plentiful wherever you sail. You really feel like a survivor in a dystopian future that also feels very idyllic. The contrast is nice, and the available resources, initially, don't distract from the feeling of scavenging for supplies that many other games get very wrong.

What the game does not do very well is incorporating the story sections. The story sections are inherently interesting but have unfortunately been made slightly tedious at best, and totally obnoxious at its worst. The game does not need platforming sections. The game does not need heavy combat sections. The game does not need poorly executed environmental puzzles. These feel tacked on so they could release a ""full product"" as opposed to thoughtfully integrated elements that work with the existing gameplay and world-building. I would say these feel like a ""second draft"" when, with some more time, (maybe a ""fourth draft""), it could really be incredible to experience the story sections.

Developers, please do not mistake me when i say: I REALLY WANTED TO ENJOY THE STORY SECTIONS.

I would say I enjoyed my time in Raft up until the third story section and then you just kind of advance the story until the end. After that there really isn't much of a game outside of developing your raft.

Would I recommend the whole game as it exists right now on full release? I would say a very hesitant no, because the foundation of this game is so good and well thought-out. I just wish the game after the first 7 - 10 hours had as much thought put into it as the first 7 - 10."

10426,"It's a fun and great game to play, whether that be solo or with friends! I definitely love playing it more with at least one other person. There's a lot to explore and quite a bit that you can build and customize your boat now. They've done a great job adding more and more to the game! I would recommend this to anyone that enjoys survival games that require food and water and health management. If you don't like building/crafting games or have to keep track of food/water then you won't like this game."
10427,Just a chill survival game with loads of surprises
10428,"Honestly, this game was an amazingly chill and fun game. None of the stress and pressure of a lot of the survival genre, which is a part of the reason I really enjoyed playing this game... Until the final release. 2/3 inventory penalty for death isn't just a little steep, but it makes every island you come across a question as to if you are willing to lose most of everything you just harvested and break all your tools because you didn't see a puffer in time or got unlucky against one of the other creeps. I'm all for a death penalty, but for a game like this, this one is a bit extreme. I'll be shelfing this."
10429,"The game's entire campaign has nothing to do with rafts and require that you leave your raft, the entire point of the game behind so that you may go and explore ""dungeons"" on foot.

Years of work has only added content that make you stray from the strength of the game which is the raft and raft building."

2 out of 4  achivement unlock
1 out of 4 got  cutseen  and 1 teleport to  end game location.
but the other not thing happen and did not unlock achivement. 
And I'm definitely not going to start a new game."
10438,"Fun concept, lacking in implementation.
-It's fun to build a modular raft and continualy add upgrades and expansions to it.
-It's not fun to fight the bird.
-It's fun to decorate and paint your raft, plenty of costumization options.
-It's not fun to fight the bird.
-Combat is lackluster and is forced on the player for parts of the game.
-It's not fun to fight the bird.

You unlock stuff up until and on the last island, most of the late game unlocks are available so late in the game you don't have any use for them. Why build an electric smelter when I have 60 metal ingots?

the kids will probably enjoy it well enough and not notice the issues. for some one who enjoys the builder type games you will need to mod the game heavly to get proper enjoyment out of it.  the game seems fun but not overly well thought out."

10522,"Been playing since EA, was so pumped for release cuz then we'll get to know the full story, etc., and I am just [b]disappointed.[/b]

Well, here goes:

Got to ""Utopia""/final island and it was [b]NOT[/b] fun. A year or so of waiting for the next chapter and instead of getting in-depth content and a fun story, we were given a full release of a walking simulator with barely any sense. It's ""a lot"" of content in a sense that you will spend HOURS trying to get through their [b]poorly made platformer— [u]TWICE[/u][/b].

One weird obstacle to jump on with is fine, 2 or 3 of it, fineee. But another 3 or 4 of that to top it off? Ugh. — Okay, assume you got through that after an hour or so. Good! Now here's a few puzzles where you climb up and down, and majority of the time, it's easier to just fall off and take the damage cuz they didn't think this through, they just wanted to be done with it. It was about 6-7 ladders with a floor on each, because there's numbers. Grab a pen or memorize it all, you'll be shuffling through floors anyway... Only to find yourself in the beginning of the platformer — [b][i]You have to do it again.[/i][/b]

2 of us were in that island for 4 real world hours. Imagine doing all that alone where no one's looking at the other end of a pipe for you to check if it's working.

Don't get this if you don't have friends to play it with. There's [b]A LOT of repetitive tasks[/b] you won't be able to automate till the last 2 islands.

Most of your time will be spent on planting, watering the plants, harvesting, replanting, watering, cooking it all up, drinking water, and refilling your purifier, while making sure you stop at every island you see just to get more materials. There's never enough to build up a ""stock,"" you can pack up when going through the story Islands. Once you get better equipments, it changes to having to replace the batteries regularly and making a lot of fuel. They take raw materials, so build a farm.

[b]Combat is absolute bonk.[/b] Hit box is hit or miss, weird clipping. Parts of the animals' body go through you or the floor, making them hard to hit and collect once you're done with it. You can also get through certain areas just by [b]glitching[/b] into it.

Prior to release, devs decided to re-write the whole story and crammed it all together just to be done with it. Story is meh and level design is just absolutely horrible.

I play a lot of survival/crafting/exploration games and don't leave a lot of reviews. [b]It's either a really good game or it's just full of absolute bs and people needs to know.[/b]"

World 3: collected a shit ton of stuff, built up our raft, started farming/fishing, killed a boar and a shark, explored several islands and more. Can say we will be continuing our play through.

10555,"I tried to like this game, I really did. In the end I was forced to conclude that Raft is not an enjoyable game and request a refund. Basically, this game fails entirely as a survival and exploration game and exists solely as a boring exercise in multiplayer endgame. I'll explain....

I play a lot of survival games, so I'll review Raft by comparison to the other offerings out there.

(1) Raft lacks sufficient instruction, be it by in-game information, tutorial or prologue, to assist the player in getting the hang of the controls and just how things are meant to be done. I'm not talking about getting a grip on the environment or what you need to understand to survive, I'm talking about understanding what the controls do. The control scheme is not intuitive and simple actions require multiple steps that are not made clear.

(1a) All this takes place, mind you, in a game that has no pause function and in which your health and resources are *rapidly* declining and passing you by.

(2) The opener of the game puts you in a situation where you know almost nothing, lack basic resources or the means to easily obtain them, lack the knowledge of what to do about that, and in which your health and even the size of your working environment are quickly declining. No doubt people who have given this game a thumbs up will call this situation ""challenging"", but I found it tedious and annoying.

(3) Speaking of tedium, the path to survival in this beginning is the most boring and tedious I have ever encountered with no room for improvisation or figuring out the parameters of the game.

(4) Access to any game assets that can improve your situation and therefore lead to more innovative gameplay are locked on islands that you have to luck into running across and which, upon your arrival, you are prevented from accessing by means of multiple powerful guardians that you must take on with nothing more than a wooden spear as you know how to build nothing else until you are able to explore the island. A giant bird that drops rocks on your head? Obnoxious.

(5) Every passionate fan who purported to help beginners lacked any useful information about how to play the actual game and always defaulted to the same advice... invite a friend to your world to help you. In other words, the only way to play this game, in the opinion of those who like it, is as a primarily multiplayer experience.

So what does this mean? In short, this game fails as an enjoyable single-player experience. It is tedious and lacks the kind of wondrous exploration and discovery that much better survival games include. It is organized in such a way that the only actual point of the game is to struggle to the endgame (probably with outside help) in order to build a cool party boat and invite people to join you on it.

If that sounds like your cup of tea, enjoy the game. If my description sounds like a waste of your limited and valuable recreation time, run away and take this game off your wishlist. Cheers."

Most games have teams of 2, 3, or 4, but with Raft, we got all 6 of our usual group together to play at once. It's a fun story-line, easy to learn mechanics, and a wonderful game that you can pick up even if you take a break."

10573,"50 hours on record, 20 of which came from the newest update from start to finish, of those 20, 8 of them were me and my buddy floating around grabbing resources to make the raft look good till my other buddy got on so we didn't progress without him. Game is awesome but way too short. Not only is it short, you get great QOL upgrades on the final 2 islands of the story line which was extremely disappointing. Like we beat the game, then you give us the option to use an advanced anchor to tie into our engine controls? There is little to actually nothing to do once the story is over so im not sure what their plan was with giving us those things at the VERY END. and about the end, it was pretty disappointing overall as well. not to spoil anything but not was i was hoping for. if you really wanted to just blast through the story line it could be done in as little as 4 hours. maybe less. which makes all of the upgrades you did for the raft through out feel really unrewarding and unnecessary. Side missions, story line choice making and necessity of the advanced upgrades would have made this a for sure buy. But its replay ability lacks majorly. Its a good game that could've been great."
10574,VERY EPIC! Except for Bruce. He mean :(
10575,goat shark is sexy
10576,"Like many survival games, great idea, poor implementation.

The main conceit of Raft is that your base moves through the world.  This is a wonderful idea as you're not tied to one location.  Exceptional in a world which is 99.9% covered in water.

The building is decent.  Snapping parts works well enough.  Part selection is a bit tepid and, having watched a few LPers, it seems like they are unaware of anything other than the basic parts.  The game does not give much incentive to explore the other part options when the basic options ""will do.""

Core progression is servicable.  However, it suffers from the same problem most survival games suffer from.  What you're doing in the first hour is much the same as what you're doing 10 hours in which is much the same as 40 hours in.  The only difference between the three is slightly better (and often immaterial) stats on your tools coupled to a texture change.  Playing inventory tetris the first hour or three is fine.  Dozens of hours in, not so much.

All of the above can be tolerated if the combat or story or progression systems are tight.  They are anything but.

* Combat is, bad.  If anyone were to play this game I would recommend peaceful because anything other than that is just an exercise in frustration.  Your basic weapon is a spear.  A spear that is modeled to look like it has a reach of about 4 feet.  The in-game animation has you shuffle it like 3 inches with the reach to match.  The hit boxes on enemies are perplexing.  I've seen LPers, and experienced, where my weapon looks like it connects and no hit is registered.  Given that you have to instantly react to the Shark attacking your Raft or lose a tile, this is simply inexcusable.
* inventory swapping feels sluggish and often you can get locked out of swapping completely.  Shark attack while you're reeling in something from the ocean?  Too bad, you can't just swap and lose the reel.  Eat, drink, place animations lag behind the actual action, leading to double usage.  And most animations look like they were made by the shyest person ever, or one who is bound in shibari.
* Sounds are muddled and indistinct.  Was that a shark attacking your raft or your rope traps gathering several items at once.  Who knows!  You better react to both the same way lest you loose another tile from your raft!
* Some progression comes from blueprints you have to find in the world.  Which go into your inventory.  Some instantly unlock crafting items.  Some don't.  Some require you to place it in the research bench first.  And none are consumed on use which leads the player to hold on to them ""just in case"".  In a game with very limited inventory space.
* Birds attack crops.  OK, interesting mechanic.  You scare them off.  They fly through walls.  Uhm...

I like the idea, I really do.  I want to like the game.  But when every system in the game, aside from the wonderful building portion, feels like it is 3 polish passes short of being frustration free, I'm just going to have to put this game down and tell others to give it a pass.  This is a game best enjoyed vicariously through a Let's Play."

10587,"i died to bruce then killed bruce, almost straved, then died to big bird shitting boulders on me, and now i have no plastic. good game"
10588,Audio doesn't work. I've only got to play it 3 times and now I can't play it because the audio doesn't work. I did research and found that this has been a problem since day one. The devs obviously don't care just so long as they make money. Do not buy. Stay away. How can a game be this old and nothing be fixed from the beginning?
10589,so cool
10590,is good real good
10591,m
10592,Very enjoyable. Fun solo or with friends.
10593,"its a really fun and interactive game. with many, cool secrets and adventures. i truly recommend this game to anyone thinking of getting it. also sometimes its difficult to know what is happening."

10596,"Raft is a BRILLIANT GAME!

Hello everyone reading this! if you're looking at the reviews for raft you must be on the verge of buying it or not. and im here to tell you that you DEFINITELY SHOULD!

I've only seen this game go on sale once for 15% off so you should know that buying full price is PERFECTLY FINE! its not worth waiting months for a sale and you should honestly go on and buy it.

The amount of stuff you're able to do after this 'Final Chapter' Update is insane, you can get tens of hours into this game and its just a ton of fun, Solo AND Online.

Although i very much recommend playing WITH FRIENDS IF POSSIBLE!
In my opinion it helps during the game and its just really fun!

Plus you cant pass up the [b] Modding Capabilities! [/b]
There is a whole modding group with discord etc. and its great so [b] AFTER PLAYING THE FULL STORY FIRST! [/b] definitely check the mods out!

I highly recommend this game and i remember it from the start and its come a long way. JUST DO IT!"
10597,"Excellent game - really enjoyed playing it. Sadly you are given some awesome blueprints for items at the end of the game, with really no point in making the items. Would love the game to be larger, as I've already completed all chapters, including the final update that came out. Sad to be finished with this game, but it was a great experience."
10598,"cool
"
10599,its a fun game
10600,"6/10 ""Sailing in shallow waters.""

I've always looked at Raft as a game without a lot of actual depth because the core loop is to maintain yourself and your raft. As such, I've waited until the very full release to play the game, but the additional content does not expand upon the main loop beyond giving you additional goals to progress towards.

Diving in relatively blind, it took me two failed runs to quickly understand what's required to achieve a self-sustaining raft. After that point, there is not much else to do except to resupply each station, reel in the occasional barrel, and start sailing towards the story objectives. The constant tool degradation and upkeep required to maintain the raft can get very tedious until the raft reaches a larger size and with some much needed automation installed onto it.

The shark threat was initially an exciting element... until it wasn't. I would say I'm not good with nopes in general, but I'm the type to eventually get used to it. For example, I get bored enough to try fighting the Reaper leviathan in Subnautica and come out on top. I've given myself some good ol' thalassophobia by delving into many such games over the years and experiencing the horrors of the deep. I imagine this element may remain exciting to others... but for me, once the initial scare/excitement wore off, all that remained was the constant grind (until automation, at which point there is not much else to do).

But what about the exploration aspect of the game? It's definitely there, but the game does not typically reward the player for it. I feel that most random islands are generally a waste of your time, and so there is not much to explore beyond the islands tied to story progression.

I would recommend Raft if you are an absolute spineless coward as the shark element should keep the game exciting for you. For anyone else, it's simply an average game with nothing else to do once you progress to a certain point. It may not seem fair, but land-based survival games are limited by the amount of land available times your own creativity. Here, it's just you, your raft, and the ocean. The narrowed focus does deliver a good experience... the first few times around."
10601,very fun
10602,"mmm poops.... 


not good."
10603,ocean trash man
10604,games poop
10605,"I did not expect to enjoy an early access survival game like raft so much. Granted most of my time spent in the game was with my friend, I think the constant progression in tools and craftables is what kept me playing even by myself. I really enjoyed sailing from island to island and finding new items and additions to make my exploration more efficient. 

However I think the biggest downside is how the game runs. The game is choppy at times and the movement is a little clunky. These issues often come with early access games with small development teams but I think it is important to point out if you are the type of player to be caught up in how a game looks and the movement of your player model. 

Overall, I do recommend this game if you are looking for a refreshing take on the traditional survival genre or a game to bond over with your friends."
10606,game is great lots of content and things to do not a game you will finish fast but there are a few bugs and glithces here and there soem things are issues without being a bug
10607,A really fun game. Almost like Stranded deep
10608,I like this game. Lets me be creative with building. The story line is long enough to be interesting and you don´t get bored from playing it more than one time.
10609,"Learned blueprints not showing up in crafting menu. I have made multiple new worlds, uninstalled/re-installed and the only blueprints I learned that show up is decorations. Apparently this bug has been around for quite awhile now and still not fixed. Damn shame too cause I was looking forward to enjoying this game."
10610,This game would have been good if i didnt have to play with some retarred polish cunt who thinks that floating around on a bit of wood is fun and engaging
10611,"10/10 Amazing music, amazing mechanics, amazing puzzles. Impossible to get bored."

the only negative thing i have to say about this is that if you want to build something bigger the grind can take hours."
10623,its a good game on its own or with friends
10624,"Amazing crafting game. The system is very intuitive! Fun story objectives, and fun customization to reach for! Def play with your friends!"

10632,Lot of fun building and even though it starts slow you can build momentum fast and the story is a lot of fun too.
10633,good
10634,I enjoy playing this with my kids.
10635,"This is my four year old's favorite game. Have you ever wanted to see a jungle gym with 200 goats living in it? Well, you can in this game.
If you can, invite some other toddlers into the game. Laugh as they wander around and paint everything in garish colors. It's great.

Outside of its role as toddler entertainment, the story and mechanics of this game are a lot of fun. Does it break the mold? Not even a little bit, but it executes a nice story in the context of a varied, enjoyable, and challenging (if you want) survival game."
10636,An extremely fun game if you love to build and explore. Even more fun when played with friends. Can highly recommend :)
10637,Fun game and even better to play with friends. I would reccomend more character choices or customization

10644,"I get tarry town vibes from this game, idk why"
10645,this game bangs
10646,good good
10647,Soooo good....cant stop playing
10648,"Kind of mixed feelings.  The game gives you no instructions on how to do anything.  Once you figure out how to do things, there's no feedback to indicate that you did them.  Fishing, for instance, doesn't indicate that you caught anything.  Definitely an interesting game, but the lack of instructions on how to do anything in the game and the lack of feedback can make it difficult to start.  

That being said, the game is interesting.  It's somewhat relaxing, though it's also somewhat frantic, as things happen regardless of whether or not you're doing anything else.  Definitely going to keep at it and see if things start to get better with more practice and gameplay."
10649,"Very fun survival game! Even when you're playing by yourself, you're never alone!"
10650,its fun
10651,this game is one of the funnest survival type games out especially with friends

10657,"I am a 45 yo father, probably one of the oldest people playing this game. I am a single farther to my Son, who is 14 now. My son got this game for Christmas from his uncle, so we installed it on his computer and he started playing. By the end of the week he had 24 hours on this game. This was horrible for me, as it was already hard for me to find ways to spend time with my son, as he is always out with his friends or just, watching YouTube. So i decided to make a Steam account and get this game to see if I could maybe play alongside him. loaded into the game, made my character and world and started playing but I was stuck on what you where supposed to do. I asked my Son for help and he hosted a game for me to join. loved it as it was the best time had spent with my Son since my wife had died. This game has ever since brought me and my son closer again and now we actually spend time together outside the house together as well. This game reminded me that there's fun to be had in everything, and it has brought both me and my Son many happy memories."
10658,.
10659,"This game is amazing! It has been a long time since I have been absolutely addicted to a game where all I want to do is come home after work and play a game! Not only is there so much to do in this game, but the elements of minecraft (which I love) make this game so new but also comforting to play!"
10660,yes
10661,"What a welcome surprise. Great mix of survival and story, with just enough constant fear of toothy death to never feel comfortable, yet somehow still relaxing. Got ~40hrs in the base game (normal), with about 60% of available achievements. After the story, you can still play the survival element endlessly, with the advantages of various blueprints. I will likely go back for the majority of remaining achievements and perfect my raft."
10662,"Simple game, very chill and fun, a little buggy around the edges but nothing too gamebreaking and can be ironed out in updates"
10663,Beware of sharks! Otherwise there's a lot of garbage in the ocean you have to clean up. 10/10 would collect again.
10664,goodddd

10669,"pros:

mobile base (less than a handful of games like this)
chill survival
good mod community thatll hopefully grow
still getting updates
i like the building style


cons:

cant change/switch between game mode without mods.
sometimes movement seems slow, especially on huge islands
some enemies hitbox wobble after you kill them making it difficult to harvest from them

i havent finish the story at this point ill update this later"
10670,Had fun in Early access but wanted the game to come along more before trying it again. Now in release it has more to it but still can be super buggy. I've had a raft clip under and island ending that run. The warthog AI behaviors and pathing are just....not good. I wanted to see more and I'm sad at what I got. Glad to see i's making other people satisfied but there is just too much frustration for me to mull through to enjoy this game.
10671,h
10672,good
10673,"Great game, all the way up until chapter 3.  The platforming section at the end nearly erased any goodwill I had for this game.  It was detestable. Awful.  I absolutely hated the experience and made me somewhat regret the purchase.  However, I enjoyed the many hours before that."
10674,"This is a very fun game, playing with friends is fun and chaotic :D"
10675,"i had sex with the shark

10680,The game is great. but it would be better if you could rent or host a dedicated server.. i'm pretty sure thats why people aren't playing it.. same as Green Hell. awesome game but cant host or rent a dedicated server
10681,"A magical adventure, recommended if you play it with your bro"
10682,"Being that I'm really into survival games, I really like the game and its very relaxing....besides the times when then shark is destroying your raft.
Although there is a few issues with getting stuck in spots or the game freezing whenever im fighting a boar(don't know if its my computer or the game) I still very much recommend the game o anyone who is looking for a peaceful relaxing survival game with a hint of excitement and anger lol."
10683,>3
10684,I have never played this game
10685,its a pretty fun game by yourself and with others it even better. its just a lot of grinding.
10686,fun game with friends and very cool
10687,"I played almost the entire game solo and although there were times when I muttered ''I hate this game'', I thoroughly enjoyed it. Some parts are quite difficult but you get satisfaction from beating (eventually) the challenges. The only complaints I have is that the voice acting seems to be far too quiet (checked the audio settings and it looked fine so not sure if that's just a problem with the game), also I wish I could have gotten some of the blueprints prior to the last mission as it would have really helped, seems kinda pointless to get them end game. Definitely recommend and I would say you can definitely play solo."
10688,"Amazing game! I watched a youtuber play this close to 5 years ago when it was early access. It was just a raft and gather game. The extras that are in this now, blew my mind! There is a full story! There is more than just a raft. Thoroughly enjoyed completing this game and can't wait to see what they come up with next!"
10689,.
10690,"Raft is a great game. From its graphic design to its differential building items, it really does have a great range of what you can do. As someone who has played this game for over 166 hours, it never got boring for me. I'd always constantly be updating my raft and gathering resources, always trying to improve. Chapter 3 recently came out and the inclusion of voice acting was a nice touch. Also, the boss battles are engaging and feel like they've had alot of work put into them. 

If you're thinking about buying this game, do it! It's fun, multiplayer and there's always something to do."
10691,"crashes, still a beta."
10692,good
10693,I cant stop playing lool
10694,"Gud gaem
"
10695,it's completely shit
10696,awesome game play and fun building mechanics
10697,"Great survival/adventure game! I love the customization options available. I'm very grateful for the option to make mobs neutral to the player, because it would trigger my anxiety otherwise. The building materials allow you to build a great variety of cool rafts and house-like structures. Some things I'm not a big fan of is the difficulty in collecting materials. Even past early-game, It's quite tedious to collect enough wood and plastic to build with. I think my biggest annoyance is with inventory and storage management. Once you've gathered a lot of different materials, it's very slow and tedious to sort things and store them when many things don't stack. Even the items that do stack only stack to 20. When collecting flowers, wood, clay, etc. on islands, you often need to take many trips back to your raft to store things. I would LOVE it if Raft had the same sorting mechanics at Minecraft (i.e. shift-click to move an item and shift-double click to move all items). That would save a lot of time. Overall, I'm loving the game so far and would highly recommend it! The art and graphics are very well done and pleasant to look at. They did very well conveying the mysterious, eerie, dystopian/apocalypse vibes. I have yet to play through the final chapter or reach the floating city, but I've watched play-throughs and am excited to get there! Many props to the game devs and artists!"
10698,it is fun
10699,kik
10700,"This is really fun! If you go too fast through it, you'll run out of monuments to explore, though. Fear not, this is an ever-evolving game, so there will be new content by the time you would get bored :P"
10701,fun with friends
10702,Great games to play with friends
10703,good
10704,Good game!
10705,"Overall a fun game with a lot of management and no hand holding. I like the game but I darn near returned it and would have if I hadn't played past the refund point. The sole reason is pausing.

I only play single player games and then only ones that can be paused because I am an adult and I get called away to do adult things all the time, you know, like take out the garbage or fix a loose floor board. Telling my wife I can't go and do a 45 minute project because I am playing a video game is a relationship ender. Telling her to hang on while I shut down my game gets me an evening of explaining why the game is more important than she is. She doesn't like hearing that she is, in fact, less important than my game, so now the game is making me lie to my significant other all night. Pausing is important to maintaining my gaming addiction and having someone around who kind of likes me, at least on alternate Tuesdays.  

While Raft can be paused, it has to be single player and it has to be started with no friends allowed to join EVERY TIME. Coming back to a decimated raft with all of my gear gone REALLY angered me until I was able to figure that out.

Aside from that I am about 5 hours in and enjoying the flow of the game. It can be almost meditative at times, but it always has something coming to keep you on your toes. I am looking forward to digging into it further."
10706,Just good fun.
10707,"Who should buy this:

I played for 17 hours with two friends. We got past part 4/~9 of the story. Our raft was tricked out, with two levels and separate areas for doing every conceivable task. There were several of every station for processing speed and chests everywhere. I am aware that that is not optimal for getting through the game quickly.

Visuals: 2/5 okay
Good for an indie game, but not visually stunning by any means.

Gameplay: 4/5 really-liked or 1/5 disliked
This game is two games in one. I really liked the survival-crafting game that filled the first 10 hours. However, after our raft had been tricked-out, there was no longer any struggle to survive and there was no new crafting to be done either. Instead, the entire rest of the game seemed to be boring fetch quests. You go somewhere, run around the place, and pick up papers on the floor. Yes, you get nice audio-logs which tell cute little stories and allude to the mystery of the sea. However, to me it was completely not worth doing the fetching just for that. Blueprints are locked behind the inane fetch quest that is the story, and the game slows to an unbearable pace. I didn't like that part of the gameplay, and so quit. Oh, also the combat is unsatisfying. You can stand inside enemies, and when you do you can miss the hit indicator (blood). There is no hit indicator for pvp (there is, but it's so subtle you can't catch it because you're clipping in and out of them). The aiming reticle has a circle in it which obstructs your view of what you are hitting. The circle becomes extra-thick when you are using a bow, which is honestly where you want the least obstruction to your view. Annoying.

Grind: There can be a lot if you let there be.
I'm pretty sure if you are a single person and speed-run the story, then you will not have to grind for many resources. However, because me and my friends wanted to build the raft the way we did, we ended up spending hours grinding for various materials, which was not the most fun to do. On top of that, the game has a time-based grind system, which I found annoying. Every second you exist, there are various resources being used up all around your boat. That means that the grinding loop is extended, as while you grind for certain resources, other resources are depleting. It's not a particularly fun feeling, and it felt like the game was punishing me and my friends for wanting to have fun and create a big raft.

Sound: 2.5/5 okay and liked
When a song is playing, the game feels very alive and it's great. However, when a song isn't playing, the game feels a lot more dead. However, when songs are set to playa constantly, some of the magic is lost.

Story: 4/5 really liked
The story snippets were very cool. However, I didn't find the grind worth it for the story. If the story is just audio logs, then I can get a similar experience by reading a book or audiobook.

Bugs: none noticed

Price: I don't feel bad that I spent $15 on this game. However, if I were given the chance to do things over, I would wait until it was $10 or lower.

Difficulty: Not at all difficult. Just painful when you have to grind."

10750,"Definitely recommend. 

I prefer peaceful mode, where Bruce just happens to be there, almost like your only friend in the world....rather than that guy that makes you cry every couple minutes. 

But it's fun, relaxing, and can just enjoy a nice lazy float while building your dream barge

Plus the animal events just a bring a smile to the face (who doesn't enjoy a sighting of happy turtles?)"

10752,"Would highly recommend this game. Great graphics, great mechanics, easy yet challenging also and great fun solo or co-op. 9/10 only reason its not 10/10 is because its not cross platform as of yet but if it was then definitely 10/10"
10753,"What a pile of crap. Stupidly hard on solo,. Food and water go down way too fast, the shark is annoying as hell, crafting everything at once when the shark is eating your boat and food and drink are eating you, you have no time, and everything needs rope...even a spear a damned sharpened stick needs 3 rope and water purifies one cup at a time and while you are making a spear, a purifier and anchor, rope rope and rope the shark is eating the boat, you are on the verge of death all the time and then the sun goes down and you cant sleep...haven't the time for that.

In co-op the in game chat is just annoying, open the craft menu and the shark attacks you have to close it, choose spear and stab and the shark is gone ripping more boat away so...need wood and plastic to fix that when you had planned on making something else. Finally you have an anchor and can land on an island and you die of thirst and hunger because you need stones and you have one potato and the one cup of water is back on the boat and the game makes you walk slower now as you are dying.

screw this damned game, what a piece of garbage"
10754,I love this game starting with nothing then getting everything in time fun love the to explore good game to play
10755,best raft game ever
10756,epic
10757,It takes some time to get to a comfortable place but a super fun base builder and survival game.
10758,"really fun game

10760,addicting game. I got this game three days ago for my husband and I to play together and we have already played for 12 hours.
10761,"It's a very fun, realistic, and peaceful survival game involving lots of strategy. It's very enjoyable once you figure out the basics, and play with a friend."
10762,it does what is says on the box
10763,"Fun game I recommend you play with a friend

(game boring alone)"
10764,Its so addictive and definitely the best survival game Ive played
10765,:)
10766,good
10767,Great game !
10768,"Finally the full game is here and i played from start to finish.
I had such a great time it was really enjoyable but there was some bugs for me. The worst bug was at the end.
The last bossfight the audio and voice started glitching the game crashed 1 time but even after restarting
the audio and everything was still messed up."
10769,7.5/10
10770,I AM PREPARING FOR THE FUTURE WITH THIS GAME!!
10771,"It is fun.... but... by the time you are really able to make your dream raft you are already done with the game as you do not get most of the advanced schematics to make stuff like the anchor that can be lowered from the engine control until the island just before the last when it is kind of pointless and not really needed.  Utopia was just a shanty town and is definitely not the ""paradise"" the game made it out to be."
10772,"This game was pretty fun before the last update. The story islands were captivating and left you eager for the next island. However after the last update I was left feeling underwhelmed with how it ended, the last few story islands just felt rushed, not much fun to complete. Utopia was the most disappointing by far, and my hopes had been built up since starting the game."
10773,I'm just going to be honest. My partner and I played this game when it first dropped and loved it. The concept and gameplay are great. We were so excited for when the final part of this game just came out. But it was short lived. - The ending is honestly very ordinary as well as Uptoia. Getting the tools as well at end game... why????? Why give the player the upgraded tools when the game is over and you no longer have use for them. Whoever thought that one through..... Clearly didn't think it through at all. This game had potential to continue to be amazing but we were both left with a sour taste. Shame.
10774,mjkkj9ihi
10775,"This game has motivated me to consume more plastics and just throw them in the environment, so that our ancestors in the far future may never have to waste so much of their precious time collecting plastics as I have in this game."
10776,Best game what i played in last 15 years
10777,raft is a very fun game
10778,"I had this game pop up on my suggestions a few times. I always passed it up. Thought it looked like an interesting game, but the visuals gave me a ""childs game"" vibe, much like Fortnite. So I always kept scrolling.

Caught the game on sale for $8 and thought ""why not?"", downloaded it and immediately spent 60 hours on the game. I was very surprised to find that its much like Minecraft mixed with the movie Waterworld and it has had a lasting appeal that kept me coming back. The amount of activities, builds and content makes the game very fun to keep playing and has a replay value to it. Its fun to see how different/fast you can play through. 

I suggested this game to several of my friends, whom all said the same thing as I did. ""I kept having it show up, but always scrolled past it""... I was able to get one friend to download it. Him and his son binged on it as me and my son did. Now all of my friends and their kids play."
10779,COOL
10780,bery the good ( . )( . )
10781,yes
10782,"1.0 Update review:
Can't say that the came is bad and not fun, but the last update is the worst. The story islands are extremely boring. The game is not sure if it wants to be for kids or for adults.

I really enjoyed the game before, because every previous update brought some new gameplay features and mechanics. What does a new update brings us? Two boring bosses, some locations that do not contain any interesting activities and titanium instruments in the end of the game when you do not even need them.

This is a disappointment for me personally.

Overall game review:
If you have never played Raft, I strongly recommend it, it's a decent survival game. Building your own raft, sailing, exploring is really fun, but do not expect much from the story."
10783,"It is beyond me why the reviews are so positive for this game. The game itself is a chore, with many nonsensical design choices. The world revolving around your raft is just bizarre, but I was willing to go through with it. The raft physics and collection is bugged. For example you can only collect the materials on the seafloor, if the game recognises you as swimming, even if you are standing on top of it with your hook. Casting your hook to collect materials when the ocean is wavy makes your hook float in the air without snagging anything. The melee combat is utterly terrible, with your wooden spear having the range of a toothpick. Hit a goat 20 times to kill it with my terrible spear, while it kept moving through me as apparently my character has no collision, only to see that you cannot harvest it for its flesh. Did your spear break when stabbing a shark? No worries, you have a metal hatchet right? Wrong. Those can only be used for cutting trees lol. Swapping between your hook and other weapons bugs them out, forcing you to swap again for them to be usable again. Truly astounding how there are many great survival games on the market, and the developers still managed to get no inspiration."
10784,\
10785,yes
10786,pp
10787,Fun to explore even now when the full game is out with voice acting
10788,"Není to Bruce, je to Ferda."
10789,"Super fun survival game that's made even better in multi-player mode. Get your friends, hop online and see if you can make it!"
10790,Fun to play with friends.
10791,fun
10792,really good game
10793,Guud gaem with frinds and fimily i recomend allot if you like grinding and advancing fast and bears.
10794,"My wife and I were literally talking about outdoor activities to go do for date night. But since Raft went full release, and we hadn't played since Early Access in 2020, we figured we'd see what's new and move on to our own separate games after about an hour. This game had us locked in for 10+ hours in one session and we're looking forward to the next few days in this game. We've had so much fun that in that time played we didn't even know there was an actual story until we watched other people stream the game. Thanks to Raft, this game has become our date night. :D"
10795,Charming game - 64 hours in and working through final chapter.
10796,A fun little adventure with an interesting story and plenty of opportunity for creativity.
10797,"It's like digging a hole, but every 15 seconds you have to stop to eat an entire rotisserie chicken and drink 2L of sparkling water, and then you have to spend 10 minutes just to get those two, and you also have a some annoying toddler push the dirt back into the hole, while all you are able to do is lightly shove him out of the way, just to have him come back again and again. AND THEN AT SOME POINT MORE TODDLERS SHOW UP AND NEVER LEAVE WHY AXOLOTL"

10799,Good stuff
10800,Not a very in depth review but I keep dying to random stuff over and over..but other than that 10/10
10801,Lovely game
10802,"good game, but why am i sad to leave this game after finishing this game i hope there are more exciting games than this"
10803,there's a scary shark in this game... play with caution...
10804,"I've played a lot of raft and it's not a ""bad"" game, but sadly I can't recommend it over the other similar survival/builders. They have put, in my view, way way too much time into a story mode that is fetch and carry with some random annoying boss fights that are only difficult because of how janky the controls/engine are with zero replayablity. 

Why not focus updates on making better multiplayer, such as multiple rafts, combat or mapping? The game can look great but weather is so dull, why no giant storms that smash you to bits or regions such as warm and hot so you have to actively figure out where to sail and there are consequences of doing so?

So much potential wasted by devs focusing on single player story instead of craft, PVE & PVP."
10805,Boring

10813,hmmmmm it's good :/
10814,"Fun and all that, before the new update it was lacking content after some time you unlock everything and you can't really build much else new. I think it is worth it, great game. Been playing since when it was free on itch.io"
10815,great game! the survival aspect of the game is tougher to deal with than imagined.
10816,is fun
10817,So much to do played 7.5 hours straight and didn't even realize that much time had past. So glad I bought the game....so fun with a group of friends
10818,sexy asf game me and my 2 pro valorant player buddies bought this and are addicted to this game
10819,funny shark

10821,utopia is pain
10822,Nce
10823,Yes.
10824,"I really like this game, it provides exactly what it is supposed to, so far i have not encountered any bugs.

Edit: Finished the story after 50 hours, not slacking and not rushing either. I think I would like some form of endgame content, hoping for some form of extension in the future. I still think this game is great, although I think the switch to more combat oriented play style is not really good idea, after all, there is no way to leverage your economy into firepower."
10825,"Recommended if you play it with your friend. 
The only thing I don't like about it is how item break quite easily, there's no repairing them... you need to craft a new one."
10826,"Ngl I would have just impaled that spear straight through the sharks face instead of poking it 15 times before the shark dies and evaporates.
Also it 1:00 at night right now so I may be going crazy but the 8ft tall pale malnourished rotten skinny man is standing in my doorframe again."
10827,"nice game to play with your friends or alone. can get boring, but that could also just be me."
10828,"This game is great. It is a challenge that only makes you want to fight harder to create a better ""lifestyle"" aboard your raft. This game is peaceful at times (especially on peaceful mode where you can just focus on survival from the elements). I highly recommend this awesome game. HOWEVER... The fact that I cannot play the game offline on my single player world without a popup telling me every 5 minutes that I'm not connected to steam is a huge inconvenience. Most of the time when the popup comes up, I cannot press ""ignore"" or anything because I can't move my cursor. This causes me to have to exit the game (losing any progress that wasn't saved) and reload it only for the same issue to happen again 5 minutes later (losing all progress again). I really do love this game and recommend it to everyone, but PLEASE make it so that if I have my personal single player world, I do not need to be connected to steam to play. I play this game at work on night shift when things are slow and it completely frustrates me to the point where I close the game for good until I can go home and play (when I'm supposed to be sleeping lol)."

10849,really fun game made my friend suicidal
10850,"Super fun, especially with a friend. If you're playing with multiple friends, you will all hate each other at first as the raft starts out very small. Also, I'm the type of person that likes building and customizing my living space, and you can do a lot of that here. I may live on a raft, but it's a cute raft."
10851,"i enjoyed the game throughly but the thing i disliked was the feeling of laziness in the last three item post the final chapter, this is an amazing and fun game with simple everything"
10852,This is a really great game. My friends and I played a lot during Early Access and were very excited for the final release. Playing through it fresh and it's still a great way to spend time. Highly Recommended for anyone who wants a mostly peaceful seafaring adventure with some great challenges along the way.
10853,good but unfortunately you spawn as a woman
10854,wow aku terdampar di atas papan
10855,"very fun singleplayer and co-op
would definitely recommend"
10856,"The game is fun. It also needs some more time in development before it is ready for a full release. The majority of the game is relatively stable, but just about all of the story events contain game breaking bugs that can corrupt your save and set you back to 0."

10864,bruce
10865,terrible game i love it so much
10866,Do not run this game on low end computers. It is incredibly laggy and makes the game impossible even on Easy mode.
10867,"I've been hearing about this game for years and I never tried it before but with the recent wave of streamers and youtubers playing it I decided giving it a chance.

I bought it and started playing without knowing ANYTHING about it, like literally I had no clue what the game was going to bring me.

I played for 6 hours in a row.

Still trying to figure out stuff, those 6 hours didn't even get me far, and I'm only now starting to upgrade my raft.

Amazing mechanics, great gameplay, great survival game and decent graphics!

Couple of bugs here and there with the water mechanics (my first gameplay ended like 5 minutes into the run because the boat went under a rock and I couldn't retrieve it), but its fun."
10868,d
10869,Very fun with your friend
10870,"good
"
10871,"Chill, fun game"
10872,"I'm not going back to get another cog. Therefore, I won't complete this game. I COULD go back. But I'm not going to. This puzzle smells like a time sink (not quite like poop, but kinda like maybe you stepped in poop and you're not sure, so you wash your shoes anyway). It's just not fun to me."
10873,Such fun gameplay and mechanics. Can't recommend this enough.
10874,Fantastic game!  Can't recommend it enough.
10875,"Pros: 
-Sandboxy with a new flavor. 
-Great game to play Co-op, still fun to play solo. 
-The game runs super smooth, which is nice. Great job glitch finders and bug hunters. Raft is a pleasure to play. 
-Loved the lack of hand holding
-Base building from the start

Cons:
-Will find one at some point..."
10876,"Great game great story defiantly challenging. Few gripes how often the shark is around/attacks and how fast your food and water bar drains otherwise def worth the pickup if you like survival games. Also if you play multiplayer early game it is extremely hard to keep everyone fed and watered
"
10877,play this game it is pogers
10878,have fun finding out that you lose 2/3 of your inventory upon dying for the first time after grinding for hours
10879,"We named a shark meg and she shits on us all the time



10/10 ehehehehehehehehehehehehh"
10880,this game is cool
10881,good game worth buying
10882,hehe funi reft gaem wen sark go eat my reft i sad
10883,This game is a great game to play with friends or by yourself. It basically never ends even if you complete the story.
10884,fun game
10885,o
10886,The large swells made me seasick.
10887,"Lot's of fun with friends, highly recommend playing with at least two other friends, fun to give each other roles ex: captain, navigator, blacksmith, chef, fishermen"
10888,Recommend playing with friends!
10889,Good game can't lie :-|=
10890,Very fun with friends!
10891,good game
10892,"Considering I mostly play single player, I would not recommend this game. 
The game is unplayable solo without mods. 
-Shark respawns too fast to loot undrwater. 
-If you die your items are forfeit. Only survival game that just instantly deletes items if you die 2 inches from your respawn. 
-Devs made the braindead decision to remove console commands. 
-Every enemy is a tank except you. It's like the division but each bullet takes you 20 minutes worth of materials."
10893,the shark jumpscared me so bad i stopped playing for a year 10/10
10894,it is cool
10895,it gued gaem thet yu shud pley wif me
10896,"This is one of the more calming games I've played, that is unless, you are playing with a friend who has Thalassophobia, but other than that, an all around great game
"
10897,"It's really not that great if you play solo. The non-stop forced grind rewards more players on the same map at once. You barely get the time to test and understand the game dynamics (which are not explains at all, so you gotta figure it out.. which is mostly fine, if you had more than 10 second breaks to do that)

I'm guessing most players have to start a world without grind or watch videos on how to do stuff before they actually play - this is not how these games should work in my opinion.


 tldr, a good idea but that needs a large amount of work on the actual solo gameplay so that it's fun and rewarding rather than long and annoying - that's a rather deal-breaking flaw.."
10898,nigga balls i loooove the anal beeds feature in this game 10/10
10899,Chill game till the shark decides it's time for foreplay.  6.9/10
10900,egSER
10901,"The screenshots and video made it look like either a fun wild crafting and gathering experience, or maybe a dangerous survival mission -  but it's more like a boring road trip with pit stops. You can hardly interact with the world, and what little you can interact with feels clunky and bad. I played with 3 friends who had each played it before and even that didn't make up for how boring and empty the game is."
10902,Bred
10903,This game is great for those who are looking for a stranded survival! This is one of those few games that I always come back too!
10904,"chapter 1 was good, chapter 2 was great , chapter 3 was god awful and took way too long to come, copy and paste final boss areas and puzzles, last 3 islands were bland and tedious. Been following through the story and am still lost on wtf is going on
Game play is great, Raft building was the best part, gives you the best crafting recipes and items after you complete the story but sense theirs nothing to do in post-game the new items are of no use. Overall if you want to have a fun time building and decorating your raft I would definitely recommend but if you want this for the story then i would definitely not recommend it."
10905,dont look back while in water jumpscare
10906,Me like
10907,it's a fun (keep you busy) kind of game.
10908,"Very good concept and great multiplayer game with friends, However It needs a lot of work as there are a lot of bugs and glitches as well as some needed progression quality of life items to keep the early-mid game interesting."
10909,I just played the full game. I. Love. It. 100 and 50% recommend this. This is the best survival game I ever played.
10910,Great survival game played solo or with friends.
10911,so good

10913,"could be a good game for a certain kind of person. definitely overpriced for the limited content, though."
10914,wdaszcx fsdfsfddsd i like the game but i dont feel like typing all that
10915,A cute little survival game with a cartoonish style. A few areas that can be improved like in the plot/lore island the dungeons need more materials for players and the lack of short cuts to get back is a pain. Over all though a nice and relaxing survival game.
10916,its a game
10917,is good game
10918,much fun with friends
10919,Super fun when playing with friends! Give it a try when its on sale.
10920,"The game is pretty fun to play and the story is awesome. However there are some things that are incredibly annoying. I felt like I was sneaking all the damn time despite almost breaking my pinky trying to sprint, tthe shark that follows your raft has a cooldown on him attacking the boat, that runs while you are exploring islands meaning the second you return to your raft, he is munching on some wood. I had 3 animals die an my raft despite having grass patches and watering them all the time (my llama died/despawned with 4 grown gras patches). also there are some place I was almost stuck due to lack of ressource (almost didn't get out of Temperance bc I had no mats for new weapons, plus the arachnoids are tricky with a bow).

6/10 would recommend but probhably better with friends, might get frustrating at points otherwise"
10921,hate it
10922,good game very enjoyable
10923,i just finished the game and i loved it the micanics are good and i love the story its so much fun and its rely enjoyable with friends me and my brother played it we had so many lauphs and had so much fun 9/10 recomend to play with friend if its your first time or just want a laph my fav part was when i drove a snow mobile it was so cool also dont mind my spelling
10924,survival
10925,"Im sure this game has the potential to be fun. The learning curve and beginning of the game doing the same tasks only to get messed up by a seagull and loose everything was enough to make me rethink things after the 3rd death. 
I ended up finding an island and spotted a Lama and i cant tell you how many stabs it took me and my friend but when i was half way through my 2nd spear and the Lama was still running around the island was enough to make you scream when seagull dropped another rock and I have to start over."
10926,"Fun with friends
"
10927,the only way i can describe this game is if you take subnatica and remove the horror elements and replace it with an asshole shark i nicknamed bruce after jaws
10928,Great game
10929,"Its a fun survival game.  some parts are not for those you hated Mario... some platforming involved. Overall, it is simple. grindy and fun.  Too many sharks at the start tho."
10930,"Challenging at first when trying to get the hang of it, but game play is simple. It is hard to manage, though. Easy to play, hard to succeed. Good balance."
10931,"Raft is a good game in concept but you then discover the grind, and the story gets worse as it progresses. The final chapter is nothing but puzzles and annoying boss fight with endlessly spawning enemies that aren't affected by AOE attacks but can drag you in and chain you to death, but if you die you lose all your items. So you need to grind for all the gear and equipment, wait around forever for things to be made and fill yourself up with enough stuff to deal with all the annoyances the story brings. Honestly, play it for the sandbox if you can manage it and just ignore the story because its really not that great. A previous boss fight you have to get a boss to do the same thing 20 times to kill it. It just gives you an ending slideshow and thats about it."
10932,"Great game! 

Nothing else to say, other than gather your buddies!"
10933,"Story overstays its welcome by several dozen hours, puzzles are tedious, boss fights are tedious, game is built around doing the story, taking away from the open world survival experience."
10934,"raf
"
10935,BEAN IS VERY GOOD GET NOW OR I FART
10936,"I like it. Its a survival and ""home-building"" game with fresh take on things. The activities are meaningful and raft building is great fun. Although there's quite a bit of gathering to do to build what you need, it did not feel like annoying busy work, but instead okay-ish activity on the side of everything else. The story puzzles are a bit so-so, but enough to keep the interest until the end of the story. Well worth the play!"
10937,Great game
10938,great game 10/10
10939,good game
10940,"Overall a very addicting game that is well worth it's price. The graphics and look of this game exceed the expectations from such a cheap and fun game. Most exploration, survival, and tycoon type games come nowhere near as impressive as the free-roam and accessibility given to the player when playing this game. The player gets to do whatever they want with as much choice and creativeness as they want. The multiplayer function and community surrounding this fantastic game is so welcoming and motivating. If you're bored, Raft is the best cure you will ever find, just don't rage quit when the shark ruins your day ;)"
10941,"If you're looking for a simple and easier survival type game this is the one. You start with one single wooden floor floating sailing through endless waters collecting plastic, metal scraps, making glass out of sand, cooking your own food and mixing your own drinks, and much more keeping the experience that much more interesting. Though there are some issues for example big bird can be glitchy not flying in the air properly, the shark swimming through walls, cannot place ladders right against any walls you've made on your raft, and for whatever reason my animals that I placed well above water keep disappearing. Overall it's an amazing game with a ton of potential, I highly recommend it."
10942,"Overall, Raft is a good game that's prevented from being ""great"" due to a few bad design choices.

What's good:

The game has a good sense of progression.  You start out on a tiny 2x2 raft and throughout the game you learn to build and craft better items that make life a lot easier.  There are a few upgrades with questionable value (like the large storage box which requires expensive resources and holds less than three medium boxes that would take the same amount of wall space) but for the most part the new items you get feel like they are worthwhile upgrades.

Exploration is fun.  There are a  variety of different island types to encounter, each with it's own set of challenges.  You'll find the same basic resources on most islands but some are better for particular types of items.  After a while you'll learn which islands to look for depending on what you may need at the time.

Your mileage may vary on this next one but I think the graphics are pretty good.  If you enjoy stylized graphics then you'll probably like the way this game looks.

The game provides plenty of play time.  Overall I sunk about 100 hours into the game and my playthrough of the ""finished"" version was around 70 hours.

What I didn't like:

I think some elements of the game are too punishing on normal difficulty.  Unfortunately you may have progressed quite far into the game before realizing this and there is no option to change the difficulty without starting over.  On normal, if you get killed the game says you will lose 2/3 of your inventory.  Each time I died it seemed inevitable that I'd lose the most valuable items I was  carrying.  Add to that that getting killed also ""damages"" the few items you do retain after death.  I would also have liked to have the option for items to drop on death and being able to retrieve them.

Parkour sucks.  I'm not sure why the developers chose to rely so heavily on jumping puzzles.  Most of them aren't too bad, but they aren't really fun.  The endgame area is particularly frustrating.

The NPCs you encounter along the way seem like a wasted opportunity.  You meet a few people that offer to join your crew.  But in reality it just unlocks new character models to play.  I think it would have been awesome if they would actually join you on your voyage and be able do tasks on the boat like smelting, cooking, managing batteries, etc.  This would enhance the single player experience a great deal in my opinion.

Boss fights.  There are really only a couple of them in the game.  The first one is prey fun once you understand what to do.  (I had to look it up on the wiki.)  The second one is the opposite of fun.  The enemy is just a bullet sponge and due to the way their attacks work you will probably die and lose a bunch of stuff multiple times before they are defeated.

As I mentioned at the beginning, I think Raft is a good game but sometimes it feels like the developers made a few design choices that just aren't fun.  If you can look past those flaws you will enjoy the game."
10943,"Didnt expect to like this game so much, very nice! One of a kind survival game"
10944,its goood
10945,New chapter is just bad. Garbage enemy AI/animations and also lots of bugs. Saved my world 5 mins before a power surge and when I got into the game I couldn't load the save because it said error. Loaded another backup and I had a new character and 0 items.

10954,This is a vray good game
10955,"I was gifted this game and was able to finish the story in 37 hours. I can easily say that this game was one of my favorite story games I have ever played through. 

This game its a relatively simple game to play. It does take a bit of patience and time to learn how to progress, but once you start progressing the rest of the game becomes rather easy. The story was very well developed and makes you very interested in the backstory of this game. Slowly progressing through the game makes it very fun. Once you start to understand different things, getting better versions of those things becomes a goal and you feel really accomplished when you finally get it. I would highly recommend this game to anyone. It can easily be played solo but it is much more fun with friends. 10/10 game"

10961,"Bought this game in 2018 for my daughter, we ended up playing together and built our cozy boat, I wasn't expecting to get hooked (pun intended) on this game as well. I love how our raft evolved from a simple one towards a fully decked out boat, too bad I wasn't able to take screenshots on the early days. We sticked on a one game save and it has come a long way and now we finally completed the Final chapter. Me and my daughter will miss getting hyped up towards new contents/locations but it was a fun journey."

10986,I am almost done the story and it has been a fun experience to be honest and I really hope this isn't truly the end for Raft because it is such a great concept and game I really hope they add dlc or maybe even challenges to keep the game fresh such has in like kill 5 sharks and you get a certain material or something along the lines of that because it is truly a wonderful game and it is one of the best survival games out there
10987,fun. very fun
10988,honestly the way this game captures the way of the ocean is amazing. not too much like some games but deffinetly not too little to the point you feel its just ocean mine craft and the only thing you have left to do is build. the story line and way this game keeps you playing for a long time is the best part. i would play this game 1000000x over. if your looking for a fun to play solo/ with a friend game then honestly this is the one.

10995,"This game is a lot of fun! The only thing we were hoping for after hearing the story was that the characters you meet really were on your boat! That would be amazing. Just give them a chair and hand them a tool for a task. Slow help of course but other survivors would be awesome

Active devs, thought out story now with its final story update. Even surprised by some of the places we were able to visit and the puzzles you have to solve. It helps to have on sea sickness mode, without it I wouldn't be able to play so I am glad they thought of things like that. There is a lot to do, and endless ways to build your raft, and now with the new sideways pillars it can be made to look great with more options for placement without having to worry about so many pillars!"
10996,fun with friends

11002,"This game is actually really fun for a while. The survival aspects of this game are well balanced, making it slightly hard, but not mind-numbingly, brain-bashingly difficult. The only problem is that it really slows down once you've built up a good enough raft and you're just trying to go through the story of the game. Hopefully they can make it more interesting on that end."

11014,I have been fun with this game what basics have done. It isn't anything amazing but you can enjoy the game if you enjoy relaxing music and just collect stuff and especially on early it is great to be surprised. Only bad thing later on what I came back to this game is that the monitor option is gone. Basically this do not work well with multi monitor setup without that option.
11015,"Gave it 2 chances, got bored before I made any significant progress."
11016,Very fun game me and my girlfriend are having a blast me more than her sometimes lmao.
11017,very fun game
11018,cool rafts
11019,"Wish I could refund this.  Just when I had some mechanics figured out and working (dying several times in the process... ok, sure, it's a survival game), my raft got stuck on murder island where everything tries to murder you, and you lose most of whatever resources you managed to collect every time something murders you.  I don't think that playthrough is salvageable at this point.

If that sounds like fun, then maybe it's a game for you.  I came to it from Steam recommendations on Subnautica, and this game is very different.  From the start it's a grueling survival experience, rather than a chill one that builds to exploration, greater and greater risk taking, and developing story.  Raft's not for me, I guess."
11020,"Did you ever know about a BASE BUILDING game that doesn't allow you to BUILD A BASE? Ok... Meet Raft, a base building game, that DOESN'T allow you to build a base. You start with a 2x2 raft, and you can ONLY increase it size, you can't BUILD it. This means, for some reason, you lose your 2x2 raft, or ditch it, IT'S GAME OVER, literally, you need to babysit your starting 2x2 raft, or else you start a new save =)

I want to play a base building game, and Raft isn't it."
11021,"Quite a relaxing game. 10/10 Would grow full sized trees on a raft again. Beautiful reefs. AMAZING soundtrack!
"
11022,"This game is FANTASTIC! Especially now that the final chapter is out. It was pretty painful to have to wait for each new release, but if you haven't already picked this game up and gone through those growing pains with us, you NEED to grab it now. There's so much content and you can play at your leisure - if you want to plow through it and finish the story you can or you can go a bit slower, build up your raft, make it homey and go to the next big island when you're ready. 

The graphics are great and seems to be well coded because I play on a laptop and don't have issues with overheating, even on high settings. At the time of writing this review, I have not gone to the new islands yet (I always start all over when they come out with new content, so I'm getting there!) but I'm sure it's going to be just as fantastic as the other updates were.

My only real wish is that there was more character customization. I understand what they were trying to do by having characters unlock as you go and have them be a part of the story line, but for games like this I really like to customize my character, especially given that this is co-op. When there's only 6 (it used to be just 2!) characters you can choose from, everybody ends up looking the same lol

Overall, highly recommend picking up this game if you haven't already. And be sure to keep an eye out for Bruce!"
11023,Its so fun and I am now addicted to this so be care ;]
11024,"This is a great game, especially the multiplayer: this in my opinion is the best part of the game. The Survival mode is pretty fun, I'd say even more fun than Minecraft. The mechanic of being on a raft and trying to survive the attacks of a shark while caring for your hunger and thirst is (for me) creative. Try playing this with your friends, and it gets really fun."
11025,"very fun I enjoyed, played through twice and would do it again"
11026,"I had originally gave this a negative review but deleted it when I ultimately decided to give the game another shot.

I'm glad I did.  My initial gripe was the constant repair and non-stop search for food and water in the early game.  It quite literally has you running around your raft collecting items, crafting replacement tools, grilling, planting, fighting off seagulls and the shark.

It wasn't until I researched and set up the upgraded grill and water purifier that it finally calmed down, and after that I had a blast with the game.

I felt like the last chapter had too much platforming in it, but some good puzzles and environmental threats to overcome.

I don't foresee myself playing again, but it was definitely a good time."
11027,"Good game especially if you play with your friends
"
11028,"- Wake up

- Repeat"
11029,"its a nice game, very relaxing which is what i need at this time of my life.  I play with predators off so its even  more chill.  you spend time harvesting materials from the ocean, islands or diving in order to build.   crafting is simplistic and easy to do.   really enjoy the interface where you can easily back track to make certain items needed to make the bigger recipe all without losing your place in the crafting menu.    

downsides: my sound has never worked right.  i have only had it come on once since playing and its a really immersive musical score and background ambiance.  wish it would kick on more but i still play the game without any sound.         

also, without going to forums i would have no idea there were other biomes out there to find, there is no clue and it gets pretty dull quick once you have built all your menu items and have a ton of stored mats.  

  island shapes repeat lending even more to boredom.  i wish it had more random formations.   
you can also lose crafted items if you accidentally deconstruct a furniture piece, which is easily done as there is no targeting icon for building.  I lost a hammock, fished rewards etc that way.  its confusing as sometimes the items will automatically be picked up, other times no and gone. the swells,  
i wish they wouldnt cover the interior of your raft, there has to be some way to make the waves path outside of a completely built interior.

regardless, its a lovely game and i love my raft."

You'll be spending 80% of your time desperately trying to gather wood to repair your boat from the constant shark attacks and refill your water purifier and grill.  It feels like a wood simulator more than a survival game."

11059,"For a game thats supposedly ""finished"" now, there has never been more problems since the final chapter released. Items and chests disappearing, animals disappearing during and after sessions. Me and my friend lost all of our bees and honeycomb due to a chest somehow missing after we logged off. We had a pen full of animals and half of them just suddenly vanished. This isn't the first time it has happened. Reloading a past save doesn't fix any of it either. If you wanna lose everything you worked hard for while putting up with the many other issues and bugs this game has suit yourself."

If you want to play this Game its recommended to find a Mod that improves the Durability of Tools. Even advanced Tools are breaking so fast, that they arent worth the effort and Materials to Craft."
11064,i cant count the amount of toes the shark has bit off me ;(
11065,"Really punishing for new players.  twice now I've died and lost so many resources it's more efficient to restart.  even after using shark bait, still immediately got killed.  I don't know what I did incorrectly but I've spent a couple hours learning nothing and being punished as much as possible.  I don't know if it was a glitch or if I don't understand what's happening, but at this point I don't care and I hope I'm lucky enough to get my money back."

11086,"gud story, gud puzzle, dirty sea :v"
11087,"Raft: Thirst and Hunger Simulator

Gameplay:
Besides that (quite big) flaw mentioned above, it's a really nice game. It even has a story which I didn't expect at all when I started playing. Might be a bit too slow of a start, but just make sure you explore both land and water as well as reserch everything you can to unlock more crafting options. 
Every story location you come across functions pretty much the same as the last, explore and find quest items to get trough the obstacles that is in the way of the coordinates for the next story location.

Achievements: 
Tedious and slow, although most can be cheesed with save, kill/dig/capture/etc, quit without save, reload. That wont help you get all of them quickly though and honestly probably not needed because of the next sentence. Hope you enjoy taking anywhere between 97.33hr-121.67hr to reach 365 days on a single save file, and remember to drink and eat :)"
11088,"Oh hell no.
Look, survival is a well understood gameplay mechanism that can be fun, tense and interesting when done well.  This is not that.
A hook that 'runs out'. A paddle that 'runs out'. Come on, seriously? A shark attack that is largely silent? A tree, once again, that I need to select the axe to chop. No, really, I thought I would chop it with the paddle this time. Truly.
Survival is fun when done right.  This program fails some of the absolute basics around that. Avoid unless you like punishment."
11089,best game
11090,"Full disclosure, this is definitely an ""I wish there was a neutral option"" kind of review. I enjoyed Raft through the first half of it. The building and creativity aspect is great, and it does a good initial job of sucking you into the world and getting you invested. By and large, it's well polished. I encountered a few bugs - glitching through the floor kind of things - but nothing that I'd say was game-breaking. 

I first picked up the game a bit over a year ago with my wife, and we played through about half of Tangaroa before we called it quits to wait for the final release. Now that that has come, and we've finished the game properly. And while Raft, at its core, has a good concept, the story overall feels disjointed. It's a series of islands that you go to to pick up the next piece of the story, and each one in and of itself is a separate segment of the game. To make matters worse, it feels like most of the really useful tools are pointless.

We spent the entire game looking forward to things like the wind turbine, electric grill, and electric purifier, and by the time we got to them, we had only 1-2 islands left before we finished the game. There was nothing else to do, and those constructions were rendered pointless. 

So as I said - at its core, there's a good crafting/creativity kind of vibe here. If you're able and willing to give yourself goals, and build your raft up just for the sake or building it, then great - there's a bit too much waiting for my tastes, but you'll have fun. But I felt like I embarked on a journey I had no emotional attachment to, in a world where all the cool stuff I could get access to wouldn't be available until I had already finished. As a goal-oriented player, it definitely wasn't for me."

11101,"My husband and I played through this after the final chapter came out. I found it extremely enjoyable, but wished there was ""more."" It has an extremely good base that just feels like it's the bones of something that could be really amazing. You also unlock all of the coolest stuff when the story ends...which isn't ideal unless they add some end game content.

I still recommend it to anyone who enjoy builder games with a chill feel and some danger. Seriously, just management of the raft is fun. I'm looking forward to any updates they do to the game or anything the devs tackle next. 

P.S. I take extreme pleasure in killing Bruce the Shark. And eating him. 

P.S.S. Take a dive, Bruce."

11105,"Amazingly Fantastic Super Fun Game, I highly recommend it to all gamers to get and play."
11106,"The concept of this game terribly boring for me. The progression of development is very slow and boring, because you do nothing else, just floating on the water and you need to look around all the time for the randonly coming materials... how is that fun? Also your starting water and food resources are very limited, and it also make the game utterly boring, you need to repeat so many things again and again while you just stand on your raft and looking for those random materials you need.
Simply boring, because in other survivor games at least you have the feeling of freedom to discover the land and its nature around you, but here you can just visit some random small islands (mostly) which also don't offer much for you exploring-wise.
For me any other game felt more interesting as Rust, The Forest or the Medieval Dynasty, I would rather suggest those if you look for survivor games."

The story line is a lot of fun and the puzzles will keep you occupied for a decent amount of time. Try to avoid looking up spoilers. I promise each puzzle you can figure out.
There's plenty of goals to go for even after completing the game such as achievements and other completionist type agendas. Try to get every item in the game and it will take quite a long time.

11135,it is amazing and fun I hope you also like the new raft chapter 3 update
11136,"This game is a ton of fun and makes for ridiculous antics with friends. Go check out any multiplayer gameplay on YouTube and you will see what I mean. I saw Markiplier's videos and HAD to get it for myself. Friends got it too and we have a blast creating insane rafts and systems. We named the shark and yell at him constantly. 

The new update completed the storyline and added so much since I started playing. 

It does require a decent computer to run well though, so check the specs beforehand."

11138,Yes.
11139,"Thanks for being part of my life. I finished this game like for 3 or 4 times lol i really love everything about this game. The graphics, gameplay, audio, all of it. Im so happy yet sad that this game will end as the Final Chapter released. Well anyway, thanks a lot dev ♡ ´･ᴗ･ `♡"

11146,"I've been playing this game since it was a little demo on itch.io, way back in 2015, 2016? After that, it was a no brainer day one buy for Steam Early Access.

It's amazing to have experienced this game's progression and to see how far it has come since then and I've loved every minute of it. An absolute gem of a game and I'm glad it's found so much success.

If you're reading this and you haven't bought it yet, what're ya doing?"
11147,"Really enjoying the new update so far. The game is such a great combo of epic scenery, interesting story line, moderate combat, creative building, and interesting puzzles. My kids and I are having a blast adventuring around this desolate underwater world on the trail of survivors."
11148,great fun game keep up the good work
11149,
11150,"8/10 good story, good building system, thats all"
11151,Easy to hop in and out of multiplayer games. Exploration and crafting is fun.
11152,peepeepoopoo
11153,"Enjoyable game.  Played 30 or so hours between initial early access release and now.  After 1.0 released I did a full playthrough that lasted ~40 hours solo.

Raft/Base building is fun, though a bit constrained by limited geometry options.  Survival aspects are well implemented resulting in a pretty frantic gameplay loop of crafting and gathering that isn't really alleviated until very late in the game with some of the advanced research options.

Couple gripes:
1)  1.0 introduced a bug that causes engines to just randomly disappear.  I broke a foundation 2 blocks away from my engines and one of them poofed, the other didn't.  In another instance I was gathering in a reef and when I came back all 3 of my engines were gone.

2)  The research rewards at the final story location are largely useless by the time you get them.  Why they decided to give you the final tier of equipment after you've finished the game is a decision I just don't understand.  It's not like there's any meaningful post-story content to engage in that benefits.

All in all, a fun experience for at least one playthrough.  I don't imagine there's enough variation within the game to justify multiple playthroughs unless you're self imposing restrictions to make the game more difficult or something.  If you're into survival games it's worth the ride and well done for the price.

11154,i hate shark
11155,There is a distinct lack of help in game for getting started.  Once you are up and running it gets much better but a tutorial for 1st time users would really have helped.  Used Youtube quite a bit to explain what was what.

11170,"Overrated. 

Sadly people can't even rate stuff. At best it is decent, but there are just better ""survival builder"" games. I would say this game is just more annoying, like a juggling act. 

If this is a 92% positive game then a crappy mediocre game like Fallout 76 is a 100%. Seems anything that is cartoon-like just gets a pass."

11183,I think this is a great solo or multiplayer game. The recent updates have made it one of my favorite survival builder games and there's a lot of modding available as well. Def recommend for all ages.
11184,"Game concept is very easy to understand. Very fun playing multiplayer. 

Shark's alright, the bird with the bomb poo is worse imo.

Also planks are your best friend. THERE CAN NEVER BE ENOUGH PLANKS

Verdict: 10/10

11185,Este juego demuestra como un simple ciudadano en una balsa de 2x2 puede crear un imperio con la palma de su mano y un gancho hecho a base de basura.

11189,"Trash to pirate ship, very fuuuuuuun"
11190,Really good survival adventure.
11191,"I joined the game after early access but had my eye on it for some time. Playing Co-op makes the game even more enjoyable but for 17€ that I paid, 30h+ worth of content if you just do the story (and there's loads more to do if you want to) this game is worth it. It drags you in, you want to know more and you want to play more. 

I do hope for a DLC, specifically a machine gun or anti-air battery because if that fkin bird takes one of my flowers again I'll hack the game and add an anvil to his stupid wings."
11192,LOVE IT SO FAR VERY MUCH

11204,Fun
11205,"PROS
• Short but sweet puzzles
• Beautiful graphics
• Very minor bugs if you play correctly
• Unique storyline
• Good surprises
• Challenging if played on higher difficulties
• Fun with friends and by yourself
• Intuitive gameplay

CONS
• Bugs can lose about 10 minutes of time
• Very laggy/unplayable on lower end devices
• Building has its limits
• Story can be skipped on accident with multiple players

"
11216,its fun but it takes maybe 30 mins to get used to. after that you'll probably be playing it like a pro
11217,"this game is really fun and its not too hard and not too easy, its fun to play by yourself or with your friends!"

11224,"pretty good ass game, very fun to play and explore with friends but also can be somewhat annoying to get everyone on at 1 time to expirience every aspect so definitely better with 4 or less if ur at least doing ur first time of the story."
11225,"My team on Valorant was baiting me, a kj main, and were doing a terrible job at trading me, so i had to frag out and comeback from a 5-11. after the game i didn't want to feel that rage any longer so i got off and played some raft. i had a blast just sailing around and grabbing shit with my hook, not to mention how easy it is to kill Terence the Shark. i'm afraid of the water though so i rate a 7/10, would vibe with again."
11226,"Good survival game, both relaxing and stressful! Great story and great game mechanics overall, would recommend."
11227,If you like Minecraft or Sea of Thieves you'll love this one.  Little bit of Valheim in there too.
11228,"I did not expect to enjoy this game as much as I do.

What looks like a casual float in the ocean survival game, is like an onion that has multiple layers and interesting mechanics.

You start off on a 2x2 in the middle of the ocean, and oh yeah, there's a hungry shark.

From struggling to survive, to doing well, to doing story missions, puzzles, jump quests, research, crafting, food and water management, farming, building and so much more.

You can even leave your raft and visit islands, cities and more locations.

All these systems become a bit much to manage, then you automatize them and everything becomes allot better manageable.

I can tell from playing the people from Redbeet studios are survival game lovers themselves. 
In some places you can just feel a Rust vibe, among other games.

This has got to be my favourite survival builder so far.

Downsides for me:

Lack of options for playthrough
- shark attack interval
- hunger/thirst
- pet produce / food intake

Needs some lightning and storms and longer weather periods.


I highly recommend this title! For the price this game is at, and the content and hours you can get out of it, it's a fantastic deal!

11264,This game is.. great! I started the story a few days ago and I loved it! I have finished it now and the good ending is beautiful! You get so much respect and its just such a blessing! I felt so good about myself as you will get so much reputation for saving lives in this game. And seeing all of those lives happy and together creates a tear to my eyes. Developers of raft... thank you... and well done!

11266,"Great Game, had tons of fun with all the new stuff they added in chapter 3. Graphic's are good. I played this game solo, but It's most fun with friends. It sometimes can be a bit of a grind to get certain items. I love  the sense of adventure this game gave me, also exploring the deep sea in some story locations was fun. I 100% recommend getting this game if you have a couple of friends who have it as well!

Crafted a paddle, was able to land my raft in the middle part of an island. Birds started attacking me. When I tried to paddle back out again, raft was stuck hard. Death loop of birds killing me and raft stuck. This is all in the first 30 min of each game restart. Uninstalled. I hate to think how many other bugs awaited me."

Not to combat heavy, though there is some. Fun enough that playing multiple times isn't boring, though doing it solo multiple times isn't great. Overall I love this game and as long as I have people to play with I will play it."

However, the game is not perfect. After playing it, & then seeing the reality of the world we live in, it will make you want to run off & build a raft to live on the ocean. Which, it turns out, is a lot harder than the game makes it look!"

11308,"A nice twist on the Survival crafting genre. With a market that is high saturated with the same ole run of the mill ""survival crafting"" games, Raft stands out as a much needed new/fresh experience. Most survival games start off as a slog to survive which deters players away. Raft however keeps you interested from the very beginning. All that being said, I do have some grips with the game. 

The game does start to drag once you have unlocked most of the recipes. Most of the ocean does feels empty as it lacks life other than the shark that stalks you through out. Also, you cant attack with a hatchet which straight up doesn't make sense. These are minor gripes that will hopefully be addressed later down the line."

11313,Who the fuck cares about Story. I just want to go fishing
11314,This game is honestly an amazing piece of artwork.  It makes you think more deeply about the world while keeping it simplistic in its design.  While having engaging game play no matter the mode you choose.  With a deep customization system for the raft itself with a fluid progression system.  My only possible gripe would be the story ends and there is no further end game.  If they continue development on the game i would love a rouge-like endgame to use the end game facilities more.  As i say this the game does not end and you can continue your journey if you wish and many do as it can be relaxing.   Overall 9.5/10 worth every penny and suggest you try hard-mode once you understand the game mechanics it can be a rush at times.

11343,"One of the best survival games I've played so far (and I've played plenty). The idea to start drifting in the ocean and having to expand your floating, mobile base for me was refreshing and made the game super interesting from start. 

Exploration is fantastic as you start ""exploring"" just by drifting around - until you discover new means to do focused explorations i.e. decide where to go and craft the necessary parts to actually steer your raft there. The story is rich and there's plenty to discover!

Playing solo works, but in fact it's way more fun with friends. Combat is challenging as first you must learn how to counter each type of enemy and then craft better weapons/armor to fight better. 

All in all Raft is a really enjoyable experience with a touching narrative and beautiful scenery - one I would totally recommend! :)"

11365,"This game is so strange. The level design of basically every story island is inspired, the sound design is fantastic, the visuals are well-done, and the progression is smooth, if somewhat bottlenecked.

And yet... the final island is such a huge let-down. The puzzles are a massive step down in both quality and design. The 'climactic' fight is literally just 'walk backwards while left-clicking' with a series of 'stack boxes sometimes'. I have never felt so disappointed in the final chapter of a story as I did with the final island in this game. It killed any desire I had to continue playing.

I played 25 hours of this game in under a week. It held my attention so well. But when you stumble THIS HARD at the finish line, I don't know what to tell you.

But I still gotta recommend it. Because damn the first 9/10s of this game is insanely good."

11367,good game
11368,good game good devs
11369,Extremly fun
11370,g
11371,yes
11372,"Generally this is a recommend from me but with massive minuses for some parts of the game.

The base game for this is a fine enough open world crafter with fun progression and new things to see, I have some nit picks about the some of the mechanics such as moving at a snails pace if your food or water meter drops too low and the combat for the most part being brain dead easy but most of this is ignorable and doesn't detract too much from the overall game. 

However where this game breaks down is every single story line island. The first few story islands you come across are mostly boring and tedious as you search around for whatever treasure hunt piece you need to progress to the next story, they're inoffensive but horribly dull but tolerable because you get shiny new blue prints to get progress. And then you get to the final chapter islands and every single one of them is a test of patience and endurance as it feels like you're almost physically fighting the level designer. 

 There's literally a puzzle where they force you into a room of radiation with a hazmat suit while you're trying to figure out the puzzle, this wouldn't be so bad except the hazmat suit has a goddamn timer which means you'll be darting in and out of the room while trying to figure out the stupid puzzle. The radiation can't even really kill you it's so slow so there's absolutely no risk and all it adds is tedium. 

Apart from the tedious bosses there's also the infamous platforming sections which you've probably already seen people mention but needless all you really need to know is that its first person platforming with really poor collision. Lastly we get to the bosses which are both tediously long and extremely easy. The last boss is just a giant health sponge that you hit over and over till it dies, it has the same boring easy combat as all the other enemies except that it occasionally does a special move that's hard to dodge, but you have 3 healing salves you'll probably be able to kill it easily. 

I really wish they had come up with something better for the story islands or just a better way to add progression into the game that would revolve far more about staying on your raft rather than doing tedious busy work."

11379,"Do yo like feeling anxious about when things will go wrong? Well then, this is the game for you! No matter how many times you accomplish your tasks (kill the shark), there will never be an end. There will be new tasks (the shark respawns), when you least expect it."
11380,among us
11381,good
11382,dont download ripoffs of this game
11383,its a very fun game it didnt take me that long to learn the controls the game play is awsome and this is a game about the ocean and i hate the ocean but this game is one of the funnist survival games i ever played i just wish i had close friends to play it with
11384,"Building is pretty good. Story was interesting. The creative direction with the items in game was amazing i really enjoyed how they incorporated items into machines and equipment. If you can play this co-op i highly recommend that instead of solo. Solo is ok just the amount of building and farming alone is kinda rough. The amount of decor in the game is amazing and im sure if i had help i would have built more. There are some negatives but they didnt overshadow any of my gameplay so i dont care about them.

GGs Devs was totally worth my time!"
11385,r
11386,"I like the gathering of resources, researching new things and having combat when *I* want it in...Peaceful Mode. Don't need sharks eating me out of house and home, literally. I finally learned how to craft a hammer to build my raft. That made a lot of difference. plenty of space for the shark to eat should I play in that mode.

I like Peaceful, very relaxing. Although would be nice if the game let me build a raft from scratch in case I get marooned."
11387,my friends left me on a big island but i heard a catchy shop radio so 10/10
11388,"So I once owned a hamster and it was sad. It played a survival game and died...

Game is good."
11389,"I very much enjoy this game and would love to see one thing improve. GIVE US THE OPTION TO KEEP INVENTORY IN NORMAL MODE!!!!!!! EASY IS TOO EASY, NORMAL IS JUST THE RIGHT AMOUNT OF GRIND UNTIL YOU DIE AND ALL THE HOPE LEAVES YOUR BODY. DEVS, PEOPLE HAVE BEEN COMPLAINING ABOUT THE HORRIBLE DEATH MECHANICS SINCE 2018!!!!!!!! FIX IT, GIVE THE OPTION TO CHANGE DEATH INVENTORY AND FIX IT."
11390,"ur on a raft

11391,"This game is beautifully done, and story rich. So much fun to build on floating through the ocean and visiting islands even outside of the actual story!"
11392,"An overall wonderful game!

A part at Utopia was completely out of character with the game and unplayable for me.  I'm stuck there and the game is done for that play through. 

Even with that, its a great game and I recommend it with the above caveat."
11393,so addicting and fun. finally a game i can play with my husband where we don't have to have an army or kill people.
11394,":DD 
gg"
11395,fun for all
11396,"No controller support, not for me"
11397,The product is satisfactory to an extent. I could enjoy most of my free time playing this game.
11398,"This game is a really good time. I played an hour by myself, and then for 3 hours with friends (total group of 4). Both times in ""normal"" survival mode. It is challenging enough to take some time for you to progress, but not impossible or daunting (except for maybe food early on, pro tip: fish). Highly recommend for a change of pace with friends, super fun and tons to explore."
11399,"Excellent survival game, puts a twist on the genre."
11400,Fun in the beginning but gets quite boring quickly
11401,great gaem
11402,"Amazing game
Getting ass chewed of by Bruce while screaming at your crew members cause they where meant to be watching him is worth every penny.

Was amazing during early access. Shits all over a lot of AAA tittles being released. Most fun with friends.

Only down side is i want to throw more cash at Devs for doing such a great job but cant."
11403,"7.8/10, too much water."
11404,"Raft had the potential to tell an incredible story of Climate change and protecting the earth we live in. Instead the story is something out of a kids novel, while the areas and puzzles were fun enough the story up until the final part of the chapter was engaging! While not spoiling anything Raft has the worst if not most disappointing ending story wise in any game ive come across. Voice acting was good atmosphere was pretty good. But the ending was actually the worst in any game I have ever played in my life
-

If you play with friends the games fun enough otherwise I do not recommend."

11417,"Raft is a ton of fun.

From a survival side of things: It isn't rediculously hard, but it can certainly be challenging, especially to start. As the game proceeds, the upgrades to your crafting that you get feels satisfying and accomplishing. 

From a story side: The story isn't overly complicated, but it is well done. Their newest addition of added voice actors for notes found has certainly made things a lot better, but before they had that, I was glad to read every single note (something my ADHD self typically doesn't want to take the time to do). It makes you just curious enough to want to know more about what happened to the world and what comes moving forward. The Final Chapter release was the perfect close off for the story, but if they ever choose to do more with the story, I will be glad to play it

From a creative side: There is so many things you can do when it comes to creativity. The building system is simple to understand, but in depth enough to allow you to go pretty crazy with it. While I love my fairly simple and decorated raft, I have seen some crazy designs out there."
11418,"money cost work work = game money 

i use mods fun fun fun mods = i am fun = i have friends = i blow up friends rafts with mods = i kill people = no more friends fun fun fun"
11419,very fun
11420,I think this game is worth more than they made it. Also best game i have ever played.
11421,BEST GAME!!!! Better Then Subnautica
11422,"It's 2028, the ice caps have melted (not because of global warming) and you are afloat on your shitty little raft with nothing but a plastic hook on a rope. 

Now you can gather some of the shit that's floating about, visit small islands to gather fruit and chop wood, and slowly but surely expand your raft and your tech tree until you got yourself a floating mansion with gardens, engines, animals and trophies of the fucking beasts that attacked you on the way to a comfortable life.

To unlock a lot of valuable blueprints, you visit story islands and structures and explore them entirely to gather clues and materials, and to figure out what the fuck happened to humanity. Once you complete one, the coordinates for the next one will be shown to you.

It took us about 30 hours to complete the story and unlock the last blueprints, and it's been a lot of fun. We spent a decent amount of time lollygaggin about to spruce up our raft as well. Recommended either with a friend or alone, though if you play alone, have a little more patience because the grind to gather enough materials will be bigger."
11423,"very fun game 9/10 tho because i am sad that story and journey has come to an end. I have completed and done every achievement and done every hidden achievement there is to do. And i am sad that there will be no more things to do, explore, or kill. I would hope that more would be done to the game to keep the grind going but i guess not. the final chapter was fun. fun to explore and fight. i wish it lasted longer..."
11424,"Great game.
:)"
11425,"This is such an amazing game, When I first got this game I was hooked, me and my cousin would play this game from sun up to sun down trying to get from location to location and have an amazing time. Some of my best gaming memories that rival Minecraft 2013 were in this game. Although chapter 3's endings didn't seem to fit in with the other 2 chapters it was still a blast to play, Just writing this I am taken back to all the times I would look up and ask discord admins when chapter 2 was coming out as well as a chapter over the years I played this game. If your looking to play a game with friends THIS would be my first recommendation 10/10"

11442,"My favorite part was where Bruce-Chan snuck onto my boat and called me a Sussy Baka, in his cute school girl uniform and then realized he didn't have legs and fell over, flopping on the deck, and died from a lack of oxygen."
11443,"I've really only just starting surviving on my raft, but I love this game so far! After seeing some live streamers play this game, I can't wait to progress further. 10/10 would recommend this game!"
11444,IT IS fun but it is better with frends
11445,pr good
11446,good game
11447,"A very enjoyable survival/base building game with a pretty interesting premise, although I have not finished the storyline at time of writing this review as I've been happy to drift and build up my raft. Picked the game up at the tail end of early access and am very happy with the state at launch, which has a solid game and a reasonable price ta! 

Definitely recommend, as the only major gripe I've had with it is wishing the base running speed was a little faster. Multiplayer and solo are great, although more people means less raft runs when you run out inventory space!

Special mention to the absolutely gorgeous lighting on water effects - big props to the team members who worked in those areas as the game is nice and colourful in general, but looks really beautiful at times!"
11448,love this animal . the shart
11449,raft float on water
11450,Craft on a raft.
11451,"Super fun co-op survival game, and I'm really excited to play with the new updates!"
11452,love it give me more!
11453,"pro: highly enjoyable, got this after watching markiplier, wade, and bob yell at each other about it. whole family now plays together, and we do not yell at each other about it! it is some of our favourite escapism. no taxes, bills, or covid, just cleaning up the ocean and watering our pets. love this.


con: wish the shark was less aggressive, cos while this makes for more challenging gameplay, it is very unrealistic and gives sharks a bad name. there are all kinds of aggressive fish and eels that could make life difficult for the unwary diver! please do not put all the blame on sharks, who are pretty chill irl."
11454,ok
11455,its a very boring game
11456,"Long before time had a name, Ninjago was created by the first Spinjitsu master; by using the four weapons of spinjitsu. The Scythe of Quakes, The Nunchuks of Lightning, The Shurikens of Ice and the Sword of fire. Weapons, so powerful, no one could handle all their power at once. When he passed away, his two disciples swore to protect them. The Oldest was consumed by Darkness and wanted to possess them. A battle between brothers broke out, and the oldest was struck down, and banished to the underworld. Peace returned, and the younger brother hid the weapons. But knowing his older brother’s relentless power for ambition, he placed a guardian to protect them; and for fear of his own demise, a map, for an honest man to hide. That honest man, was your father."

11472,Co-op multiplayer is unplayable even with great internet speeds on host PC and guest PC. the only way multiplayer is playable is to play together on LAN.
11473,"Building/Gathering/Survival: A+
Quests/Puzzles/Combat: C

Overlooking the rough ""story"" part of the game is easy because everything else is perfect and you will be spending most of your time doing everything else.

11474,Good game if you have people to play wit
11475,Amazeing game! Toatily recomended! But I wish there were able to be more than 5 players mabye 10? Anyways awsome game!
11476,"Lose 2/3 of your items when you die, unless you are playing with other people then they just revive you.  Why are you assholes punishing people who want to play solo?"
11477,"I know I haven't put that much time into this game but gotdamm I love this game. It just clicked for me on a fun, laid back, survival type game. Either way you play it you'll have fun."
11478,"cool don fight shark u gnna reret it 
"
11479,"A great game to play with a friend. Log on, work on building your raft together, and create an experience!! A friend and I were looking for a new co-op game to play that wasn't as intense as the FPS we'd been playing but still some challenge and learning curves. Raft did not disappoint! We beat the game once, then decided to build another raft when some major game updates were introduced a month or two later. Well worth the few bucks that we paid for hours of fun together."

11494,"Interesting take on a survival game. It's certaintly a grindy game, and it's clear that there's quite a bit more development left from the devs--but overall I give it a recomendation."
11495,
11496,I hate the shark.
11497,Frustrating. Lost my first game cause I explored an island and my raft floated off. Then got frustrated and quit after I crafted an item with a full inventory and my character chucked it into the ocean.
11498,Great game but devs should consider implementing fix for getting jammed against island. Almost had to reload entire game after my boat got jammed against hostile bird colony. With every death wiping out most of my inventory.
11499,That shark is SUCH a jerk.
11500,Its a good game till. THAT DUMB SHARK BRUCE COMES UP AND EATS YOUR SAIL AND THE NEXT THING YOU KNOW YOU HAVE NO WOOD NO STONE NO PLASTIC NOTHING AND YOUR STUCK ON THE SIDE OF A ISLAND NO WAY TO GO AROUND IT. But other then that it a good game would recommend.

11505,We should have just stayed at the raft.
11506,"Super fun, worth playing."
11507,Way too much arbitrary garbage to be fun.
11508,"Raft is a fun survival crafting game that you can play solo, but is most enjoyable when played with others. It's crafting mechanics occupy moment to moment game play while the story gives you an overarching goal. Once you get established on your raft, you can enjoy the creative role playing elements of the game."
11509,It good game
11510,"Good crafting/survival game, however there are some super stupid quirks that really bother me, here's a few: 
[list]
[*]Drinking/Eating prepared foods in jars/bowls consumes said jars/bowls.
[*]You can only cut down VERY SPECIFIC trees even if you're standing in the middle of a forest. How do you know which ones are harvestable just from a glance without running up to each one with your axe out? HECK IF I KNOW.
[*]You can only gather VERY SPECIFIC scrap metal even if the surrounding ocean floor is completely covered in old broken oil bins and parts of boats and other things. 
[*]Shark mechanic is fine, unless you have a large boat then you have no idea where he is and by the time you find him he's already destroyed a piece of your boat and took off.
[*]Weird little trails on islands that take you to something KINDA interesting but ultimately pointless and empty. Found a giant underwater shipping container?? Don't get your hopes up its empty. 
[/list]

I guess to be fair some of this can be fixed with mods but whatever. Some areas you go to for the story are just as empty and uninteresting as they were years ago when I first purchased the game in early access."

11529,laggy but okie... ig
11530,"With the FInal Chapter now being released, I can say with certainty that the puzzles and platforming have exponentially increased with zero time to learn how to work through them. The bosses are given no instructions or hints as to how to beat them in any meaningful way. With this insane increase in difficulty, the story becomes lackluster and provides absolutely no motivation to struggle through learning the boss fights. Level design is terrible with hardly any instructions. If I hadn't bought this game a long time back, I would have seriously considered refunding this hot mess.

If you want to enjoy this as a casual building survival game, go ahead and buy it. If you're buying it for the story and challenges, stay far, far away."

Overall, fun so long as your animals don't disappear into the deep, dark abyss."

I started playing this game with close to no prior knowledge about it. 21 hours in and I've yet to complete the story. It's really great, hours just disappear when I'm playing Raft and I recommend anyone who likes games like Minecraft and Ark to give this a try, you won't regret it."

11586,This game makes you go very big on utopia and made me very scared. Also we did not see the cut scene but we saw some random gieser sitting next to a vending machine. I was displeased because I was starving midway through the cut scene. I am very dissapointed and my four year old girl named Alex Seal is crying right now. My grandparents Flood and Alex Cwoja died of boredum and depression when seeing this cutscene. Very dissapointed.

11596,one of the few survival games that doesnt slap you in the face with micromanaging while also showing a cool story without explicitly telling the player. 5 stars EASY
11597,"Very much enjoyed my first 9 hours in this game. Already feel I got my money's worth. 

Advice to beginners: Hard mode is HARD. I haven't lasted more than 2 hours in hard mode before being chomped by two sharks. 

Researching is done by researching materials. NOT the finished product. Spent first 4-5 hours not realizing this, and wondering why my tools were all still the starter stuff. Felt really dumb when I immediately unlocked 20+ recipes. This could have been explained a bit better.


The progression feels great. Looking forward to spending another 100+ hours in this game."

11605,"Fun game. Good progression system. Constant farming, cooking, and resource gathering. All the animals that you face have some way of killing them without getting hit. Good replayability."

11608,"its fun, you can grind and build, maybe get bored, then start again. there is actually a target to the game, which i may one day reach..."
11609,This game is very fun with friends and it brings out my creative side
11610,"This is a great game, it actually gives you a lot of things to do and has a pretty cool story. For the more try hard people it has a hard mode. The game keeps the player doing something all the time or otherwise you'll die. You can solo play and that way you can pause the game without losing hunger and thirst, or you can coop play with many friends. I recommend the game to those who love survival/building games. This is a real gem."

11617,[b]Highly recommended. More fun when you play with friends[/b]
11618,very fun
11619,good game but the resource collection remains the grind throughout the game even for basic items.
11620,shark poopoo head
11621,I like the survival aspect and the ovedrall asthetic appease to it.
11622,Raft is a good game I like the fact that it is a open world game and with a good amount of chalenge so I think a lot of people will like raft and mabey you are one of them to.
11623,"Gathering resources on land is just bad most of the trees can't be gather.
.The fact that most reliable resources are come from floating junk is . . . super boring."

11625,smash
11626,"its a decent survival game. though later in the game the survival element is quite irrelevant.

cool theme, great fun with friends.
your grandma could play it, play it with my kids and parents."
11627,"Over 4 years, I've been playing this game off and on. I can say that even now it has not lost its appeal and even though I've ""beaten"" it the game still truly isn't beaten. Having witnessed the evolution of the story, the game's progression in difficulty, all the new items added for the community, I can say having played the final chapter update is a beautiful culmination of years of hard work by the team. It's the kind of game that I can come back to again and again, start from fresh, build my raft in a new manner, discover things all over again, play it different, and have fun.

Story 10/10 - watching this labor of love evolve has been an absolute treat. I love the voiced lines now as well as the more coherent story that evolved from the snippets of notes we had from the beginning. It went from what felt like a unique sandbox game with a bit of story, to a story where creative-types for both building and writing can get immersed in head canon for their own character. 
Gameplay 9/10 - easy to learn, hard to master. Glad it's much easier to recover arrows from downed animals now.
Replayability 10/10 - whether from scratch or picking up a save file after putting it down, it's fun to do.
Multiplayer - 7/10 - sometimes multiplayer can get a bit buggy depending on which person's computer is running the world (would definitely recommend whoever has the best PC to do this) but fun overall getting to play with friends, go through the story & build.
Audio - 9/10 - sometimes the bees get annoying, but the main song is just calming to listen to
Visuals - 8/10 - sometimes the visuals from island to island change so drastically (especially the story islands) that it's a bit jarring and it feels like you're in a different game, but over all the story flows well with different locations so it's not all just the same assets you see over and over again, so I can't complain too much.
Grind - 9(5)/10* - not necessary for just completing the story (hence 9/10), but if you want the most organized & pretty raft, then you'll have to grind a fair bit for everything you want. Nets help with the basics but for everything else, it's a lot of island hopping & revisiting story islands.
Glitching - 7/10 - definitely not as glitchy as it used to be but there's still a few there. The Dev team is excellent in responding to these, although for some, the community has begged them not to remove it and they've obliged (see floating floors build trick).
Overall - 9/10 - I can say that this game will stay in my rotation of games to play that relax me when I want a sandbox-buildy type game. The soundtrack definitely helps, and I hope we can look forwards to small future updates from the Dev team. The community is lovely, so definitely join the discord."
11628,Boring at start but as the game progresses you start to enjoy more and the story line.
11629,funny

11633,"grind heaven
only good with friends"
11634,"I'll recommend it, but only on the basis of it being fun with friends. However, even with friends, it can be an irritating experience. For a survival crafting game, both the survival and the crafting seem to get in the way of each other. One of the biggest complaints we've had with the game have to do with the hunger and thirst rate. 
You have a diabetic level of thirst, and there also seems to be a penalty for drinking more water if the bar hasn't finished filling for the initial amount you consumed. This probably happens for hunger too,  but I didn't chain eat food, because it felt like I was wasting what little we already had. Even with one person dedicated to being the chef, it was extremely irritating.

There are some bugs for certain. The biggest one seems to be animals sliding off your raft no matter the elevation or collision(fence, walls). Animals are quite necessary for crafting things for your survival, and this bug has persisted a little too long.

Finally, there is another design choice I found difficult to understand. Trashcubes & Trading. Trashcubes are a currency you obtain by compacting your extra resources, and trade them at a cash register on abandoned islands. Let's just ignore the fact there are unmanned trading posts on abandoned islands for a moment and take a moment to consider the point of trading. You're destroying resources to make a useless cube to trade for usable resources. WHY NOT JUST TRADE THE SPARE RESOURCES?

Since reviews are a YES or NO, I'll give this a C-
It still feels unfinished at times."
11635,bruce says fish are friends
11636,the beast co op game i ever played the story is super adectiv and i hope they make a second game supporting raft 2 :)
11637,very fun and worth the money
11638,"great game and great final chapter, 10/10"
11639,good for people who likes to feed sharks with human meat. :D
11640,"not enogh content,l azy devs, alot of bugs/glitches"
11641,Good Game to Fight your fear of water
11642,funny shark go ARGHHHH
11643,"Fun to start but the gameplay loop becomes stale quite quickly. There's really not enough activity/maintenance going on the boat to justify all the time spent floating between islands. For a game called ""Raft"" you'd think there would be a lot more to do on the raft other than purify water and grow potatoes. Also not a fan of how you're essentially on rails to go to the next island due to the wind.

Edit: The game randomly starts becoming an adventure/platformer halfway through with hardly any crafting...quest items stop even going into your backpack and into a completely separate inventory. It plays like a completely different game that just looks the same. No idea why it switched genres halfway through."
11644,Amazing game so fun and chaotic to play with friends but fun and funny xD
11645,cool game very yes
11646,how peaceful
11647,"good game

11648,yes
11649,"this game lets you play for a long time and you will get greater by just playing it.
I`ll recommend you to buy this game when its in event or discount so you`ll get it on cheap."
11650,"There is no other game that can emulate the exact feeling you get from this game - the sounds, the vast ocean, the radio playing the same calming and comforting tune, and the overall progression - its really relaxing and especially with the new update it's now even more fulfilling and exciting, the sheer amount of customization is amazing, which is why you see so many vastly different rafts in the community, its awesome.

9.5/10, relaxing and fun game that i highly recommend ."
11651,Raft: a fun story based game where you travel the endless seas looking for clues on what happened. go at it alone or with friends. the game takes about an hour of play before you can start the story but once you start the story you cant stop. this game is a must play if you love survival games/story games/ or just a game to play with friend(s)
11652,5 stars! amazing game very good graphics totally would recommend!!!

11663,Tried to get back into the game again after the new update... but losing more than half of your gathered material when dying make gathering a moot subject
11664,"Love the calm and relaxing nature but the actual mechanics to the game can sometimes be funky, still, if you want something to grind for resources with your friends and chill then this is your game :)"
11665,In my opinion i would play raft at least an hour or 2 a day so i highly rate it a 11 out of 10 :)
11666,relaxing and simple. good to do when burned out mmorpgs

11671,"Number 12.

I hate this game, After hours spent on a raft with my mentally challenged friend, I adopted a Southern American accent as a coping mechanism. The development of this accent interfered with my daily life for the following months.

dont play this game.
or do, its a little bit fun."

11673,"I had to restart a world 3 times because the game allows you to screw yourself right at the beginning without any chance to recover. No thank you, there are plenty more games more respectful of my time."

11681,"I decided to jump off a cliff to shorten the way. When colliding with the ground, I heard a crunch. The source of the sound was only bones. Fortunately, my flippers and head light were not damaged."
11682,"Really enjoying the game, its relaxing while still keeping you on your toes. Hoping the devs will release more to this as would happily like to see this game expanded"
11683,"Boring right in the beginning, suicidal when you die and loose 66% of your inventory. 

Fun when chilling or playing with friends, boring when then game ends."
11684,ب
11685,"Super chill game to hop on with the homies. My only complaint is the scaling for difficulty is not fun. You bump it up from easy to normal and the amount of times you have to eat and drink a day is ridiculous. 
Keep it on easy and its a pretty decent, laid back survival/building game."

11703,Seeing how far this game has come is quite wholesome.
11704,bruce is a cunt
11705,"Lighthearted fun, especially with the kids and friends. Fairly easy game with some interesting puzzles to solve throughout. The story line is far too short though and you get access to most items after it would be beneficial to have them. I wish they would have cleaned that up more before calling it the ""Final Chapter."" Hopefully the devs put more work into this game, because it could be so much more."
11706,very good gema played with your friends!
11707,best boat game by far
11708,"Would be great if not for the shark being a perpetual nuisance.
If you play single player, you're forced to either pick easy or spend half of your game time fishing up shark bait or healing after fighting the shark, which respawns way too fast.

The fact that the game *defaults* to an online unpausible mode is also extremely obnoxious. The fact that it's been in development for years and they still haven't done anything to fix the shark being a major nuisance is kind of sad.

I liked this game in the past, but currently can't recommend it until glaring early game issues around the shark are solved. It's an unnecessary and annoying bottleneck that serves to waste your time rather than provide challenge."
11709,"A fun game, more so with friends."

11719,"Very enjoyable game. I waited for every update and finally completed it. Only issue I find is, having to restart if your in a game of co op and the save file sits with someone else. I wish it would also create a save gave for yourself. This would mean you can continue to play on even if the host no longer plays. It sucks having to restart and work all the way through the missions."
11720,ive played alot of raft and it is really good
11721,its a fun survival open world and multiplayer
11722,Definitely worth your money if you like survival + building + exploration!
11723,"bruce is kinda scary, 0/10 would not recommend petting him"
11724,"This game is fun, but its a little grind heavy early game while you manage all your stuff alone. My recommendation is that you play with friends instead of sitting alone in your room thinking about that stupid joke you told in 4th period junior year and nobody laughed at and its probobly nothing, but that kind of thing happens a lot lately, and it seems like your falling back into old habits as you drift away from your current social circle and you're not emotionally prepared to be alone again, but there's nothing you can do about it so its probably better to just rip of the bandaid and isolate yourself now so you get used to the feeling so right now just play raft by yourself late into the night even if it makes the game harder, that way when you get tired you can just go straight to bed without lying awake trying to cry yourself to sleep but just sitting there feeling even more numb. But yea, co-op is better."
11725,"Pretty good, just not my style of game"
11726,its just 2 good
11727,fun
11728,"A topical game about a flooded Earth, set in the Southern Hemisphere. It has nice graphics and lovely music.
Only thing I would change would be: being able to claim back some items from crafted buildings that you no longer need, like with items built with the building hammer.
Overall I love this game."
11729,ahhhh

11735,Very addicting and fun to play with friends
11736,it is cool
11737,IT.S SO FUN AND GOOD GAME
11738,"Friend bought this for me. I really do enjoy the creativity of this. 

Creative mode kind of sucks in that there's nothing there but it helps with loading and making MASSIVE rigs where you can mess around. I made an apartment building.  

If you want to explore but not deal with the shark, I suggest doing peaceful mode. It's fun. If you have friends who have this, play together. It's glorious hearing everyone freak out when they fall in the water.

I did take a few breaks because once you finish the story, it can get a little boring but if you ever want to relax and build, it's perfect. I am a little surprised with how quickly dehydrated I get in the game and same with food, but once you find out the kind of rhythm of that while on the islands, it's nice."

11785,"Great game, I highly recommend it.  

I would suggest playing it on Easy mode, the resource loss on Normal (2/3rd your inventory) and Hard (all inventory) is unforgiving."
11786,"I have played this game through multiple additions of new places to explore. I have enjoyed all of them just the right amount this game is a grind to progress in. Yet if you play with some friends it is a fun grind. I have yet to play solo so I cannot comment on that part of the game, but I have heard it is difficult as well as a huge grind. I do recommend this game if you liked the Forest or subnautica as you do get that same feeling of being quite lost for some time. I am not saying it is exactly like those two juggernauts b/c it is not, this is it's own game. I do feel if you wanna have a fun goofy time with your friends to at least give it a try for the first 2 hours, and see how you feel if not then you can always refund it as long as you stay under the 2 hour mark. The food and water deplete way too fast and the shark is stronger than every other hostile enemy you encounter. Which makes no sense but the crafting as well as the other building systems work wonderfully and make up for the other quirks this game has. I hope my review helped a bit in your choice on getting this game if not that is ok! Not every review will be used and not everyone is the same in what they like in gaming."

11793,"I swear the developers researched the worst game mechanics to include in the game ever. The last level include difficult parcour that was never include any where else in the game, endless boss mob battles with no indication how to progress, area of affect damage while you are trying to figure out how to finish the boss battle. AEO during a boss battle. I am so pissed at how horrible the last chapter is in this game. It is such a huge let down. Don't bother."

11798,Jumped into the game only seeing one or two youtube videos of some gameplay.  Did not watch a tutorial cuz I wanted to see how the game feels.  Got into it and it has a learning curve for sure but its a sweet game.  I hear there is some storyline but it has not shown that to me yet.  Greatly looking forward to some more time with the game and see how it plays out.

11818,"It is very important. 

Do not DIE until you have some supplies on your raft. It's that simple.

This game has no corpse recovery to speak of, and in single player mode its possible to ruin a start up just by getting eaten by the shark before you have enough materials stored on your raft to make a new hook. Avoid this early game fail state and its an excellent little survival game."

11838,"A really good game till the newest update, which is still very buggy. You can definitely have a lot of fun if you buy it now, but you should wait till they fix the bugs before you venture past Tangaroa.

11839,"very good game, fun and enjoyable! just play with friends because alone I don't think it will be much fun."
11840,"Very fun indeed, since its a game that takes time, but with others its really fun!"
11841,"Awesome game. You explore and the loot comes to you. Your base moves with you, no running back and forth 100 times to your base to get materials. The progression curve feels really good. Starting on a tiny 4x4 square and watching it slowly turn into a floating fortress as you find and explore more is a great feeling. 8/10! Hope they add more chapters."

11845,great game hours of fun there is a story but you really don't have to do the story if you want you can just float around
11846,"gd game
"
11847,"Me and my nephew have been playing this over the past year as new lore comes out. He's less of a fan of the survival genre than I am and he's completely sold. I too find it to be one of the more delightful survival games. The feeling of progression is fantastic, the playful graphics are a pleasure to look at for hours upon hours as you go from island to island, and the lore keeps my interest.

The one criticism I will give it is that it does not play well beyond two people in the very early game. You won't be able to get a ton of resources, making it difficult to keep three or more people fed and hydrated. My niece bounced off this game hard due to how difficult it was to get started when it was me, my nephew, and her. In large part because she was constantly incapacitated due to low meters. However, at one or two people, or more after you've made some progress, this game is wonderful."
11848,killing pufferfish is pain but i would recommend
11849,"Great game! Only with one problem.. When i build too much it gets laggy, Please fix if you have the time! But overall 10's Across the board! I recommend!"

11875,good game I reccomend
11876,"Raft is, in my opinion, as close to a perfect survival game as we've gotten is well worth buying whether you plan to play alone or with friends.

Pros:
- Interesting story and lore: The world is interesting. Learning about what happened both to the world, and the characters introduced was actually fun and kept my going. I'd pick up a note from a character I already knew of and get excited to see what they were up to, or where they had gone. It was cool.

- Good characters that are fun to see see progress in the story: Exactly what I said in the last point. It's just neat seeing them over and over. Picking up their trails and experiencing their difference journeys bit by bit.

- Great gameplay mechanics: Hooking debris, exploring islands, fighting the different enemies (except the birds), and building the raft. All of it works so well and feels so good. Definitely going to come back to this game and play it more for the sole purpose of the general gameplay loop.

- Fantastic progress both in the story and in the gameplay loop: ""Hmm, this item is great but wouldn't it be nice to make something like 2x as good?"" I know you ask that when you play survival games. We all do, and this game delivers on that over and over. You finish feeling strapped down by one resource struggle and then they give a new one to worry about while the old one is taken care of by automation or simpler systems. It works beautifully and is satisfying.

- Exploration is satisfying and rewarding: Tons of different environments and a stupid amount of loot/resources/gear in the game. It's always worth going around picking up stuff and looking behind every corner. 

- Creativity is a massive boon here with designing the raft and laying out your stuff: Want a floating house? Do it. Catamaran? I did it. Destroyer class warship? I saw someone else do it. There's no end to the creativity you can have in this game. Whether it's a tiny 6x6 house raft or a massive ship that'll make your computer scream for mercy. It's addicting and very easy to sink dozens of hours into building.

Cons:
- Game is clearly not made for single player (although is still fun): When you die in multiplayer, you just have a buddy revive you. Inconvenience, bit of stress, but ultimately not a huge issue. A slight punishment that fits the overall mood and style of the game. By yourself though? You're dead. You lose 2/3rds of all of your stuff on Normal difficulty. It's just gone. You can't go pick it back up. In a game where every piece of metal means something, where every plank of wood pushes the game forward, and where every piece of gear is expensive to craft, losing 2/3rds of it from a single mistake or by a silent enemy is infuriating. This should be rebalanced in my eyes. Make the items drop in the spot and stay there for 5-10 minutes for pickup. Would add some tension and reward the player for acting quick.

- Performance. OVERALL the performance is great. I don't have that great of a PC and the game runs beautifully 99% of the time. Once in awhile, though, it dips and it dips hard. For some reason it would dip when I looked at my catch nets, I assumed all of the items in them but once I picked them up it didn't change. Also, one of the story chapters had my FPS drop from around 90 down to 20 when I looked at it. Gotta get that fixed, dudes.

- The inability to recenter your ship. So, when you start the game you have a 2x2 raft. The center point between all 4 pieces is your true center. Doesn't matter where you build off to. Whether you build forward, to the left, right, back, whatever. The center is that original central point. In my playthrough, I built a Mississippi River style paddler boat. About 30 hours into my playthrough I decided I didn't like it and began construction of a catamaran. I built a small path from the side of my paddler out to the left and that's where I built the catamaran. Once it was built, I moved all of my stuff over to it and deconstructed the original ship piece by piece. Once that was all done, I set sail again only to realize that the debris field was to my right. It was still centered on that original invisible ""True"" center. There is no way to fix this. You can't move your new ship/raft over to that point, or bring it to you. It's just stuck. So, for the rest of my playthrough, about another 10-12 hours, I was barely gaining any resources out in the ocean. I pretty much beelined my way to the finale to finish this playthrough and start thinking about my next. Just keep that in mind. Don't build a new ship. Just update/fix the original.

Final thoughts:
It's a great game. It really is one of the best survival games out there right now. Maybe THE best survival game. With a few QoL improvements and some optimization of certain things, this game could be perfect for what it's trying to do. I highly recommend buying it. Support these devs. They clearly have passion for what they're doing. I look forward to whatever they do next.

11878,"i hate htis a,e"
11879,Very good game!!!! Highly recommend
11880,IT  IS SOOOOOOOOOOOOOO FUN
11881,Super fun!
11882,"Basically unplayable

1. Food and drink consumption is unrealistically fast, and im a advent fan of survival but when your drinking water non stop something is wrong

2. engines.....they cost 5 metal ingots. So they are a hell of a investment. Ergo you expect the devs to have coded them correctly. We had 2 just ""disappear"" in one session alone. Major bugs in a game that has been out for months and months is not a good look.

3. The bruce shark mechanic is badly designed. If you play solo basically you have to leave the raft to be destroyed, and if you play with a friend you have to leave them behind, basically negating any multiplayer benefit. Why the shark has to attack you when your beached is beyond stupid.

Not good, i would advice buying from a sale or skipping to next game."
11883,good
11884,"Gather stuff. 
Make your boat bigger.
Discover what happens at the end of the world.

This is a fun, relaxing survival game where you will roam the ocean, looking for what may be the last place on Earth still above water. If you like survival, building, and games that don't require twitch reflexes, this is a good time.

Fun building, gathering, and a super cool time going through the story/exploration and all of its awesome locations. [spoiler] Really appreciated the post-ending bit! [/spoiler] Dosent take too much time unless you stop a lot inbetween story locals.

11904,great game
11905,"This game is awsome but if you install mods you will have to trouble choute a lot also idk if its trouble choute or shoot
"
11906,good game
11907,"A game that can be enjoyed 2 ways, either by following the story or simply by wallowing on the sea, gathering basic supplies and changing around your raft. The game is simplified in most respects, only foundations count for weight of boat, simple combat, etc.   

The game is definitely designed around coop (which has a nice, simple drop in/drop out system), so doing it by yourself as I did can get tedious in the story islands and in gathering the supplies you need.

I have a lot of little nitpicks I have which keeps this game from being a through enjoyment for me (like wearable equipment expires too fast, causing you to lose them when you need them most, a lot of things are not intuitive, reminding me of alpha minecraft, too much backtracking on story islands, and more...).  Also, I dropped playing this game for a while after these nitpicks got me killed and I lost my inventory on normal (it would be fine for coop, but I dropped to easy when alone)

Overall, a slightly above average experience for me.

11937,This game is a very good Ocean survival game where you have to manage resources and expand your raft there is an amazing and intricate story you can play it with friends as well but you can also do it solo a must need for survival game lovers
11938,"I can honestly say that, if you're looking for a chill game to play with a few friends or family, this is for you. I played this game off and on with my sister and it made for a rather relaxing experience. 

It's fun to slowly expand your raft and be creative, visiting island after island and discovering new things every time.
I have to say that the puzzles or bossfights weren't exceptionally challenging and without spoiling anything i can say the story is... so so. It's not bad but I was hoping for a little more, especially at the end.

What struck me as odd is that after completing the campaign you get a couple of new recepies/blueprints to use.. but there was no real incentive to keep playing. You've reached the final island and now you can just.. go.. farm I guess? 

You also plateau a bit after building certain machines on your Raft so it [i]basically[/i] runs itself, apart from you occasionally having to change a battery now and then or pour some more fuel in the engines so later blueprints aren't [i]that[/i] exciting.  

All in all we did have a fun time and if you don't rush it you'll have a great time."

I instantly fell in love with it. its very simple at its core but also because i played on easy. the art is fun. ive watched this game grow and evolve along the way over the last 4 years. in the beginning my friend and i easily lost 20-30 hrs just exploring and learning the game. then every time an update was released we rushed to play and explore the new content. with the latest update and going full release, the game was wrapped up perfectly. 1 of my best buys on steam. even if i didnt dump 100's of hours into it.... the game definitely has the opportunity to. just depends on how creative of an explorer/builder/completionist you are. 9/10!"

11947,shark
11948,"Weirdly, I really enjoy this game, especially with a friend. The reason I just can't recommend it is there are just too many flaws. The combat is dreadful, glitchy and tedious. The progression is often gated behind combat, so can really feel irritating when the pig slides sideways to hit you even though you sidestepped it or your spear fails to register a hit for the umpteenth time. The large birds dropping rocks on you are a constant source of aggravation for no reason, they don't give you anything worthwhile for killing them, are a horrifically dull fight due to the poor bow mechanics, their glitchy flight paths, clipping through mountains, and excessive health pool. Even ignoring them is irritating as they'll constantly see through everything to zero in on you and drop rocks, tanking your hp.
The raft part of the game is fun, sailing around, fishing, boiling seawater. Fighting off the shark attacks (though killing it does not make it go away for a reasonable amount of time, so another issue there). The strongest parts of the game are spent on the open sea, collecting flotsam."
11949,very good
11950,very nice i like
11951,"Love this game so much, watched it with siblings in its early stages and started playing when it was just Chapter 1, seeing this game grow has been so much fun and finally playing through the finished product is amazing! I highly recommend this to anyone, especially those who like good storylines, exploring exquisite and unique locations while slowly unraveling a story, with some challenge with trying to survive."

It's a great sandbox experience about surviving on the ocean and exploring the ruins of the old world with a pretty good story behind that. If you have friends, it's a great experience to survive early-game and progress to late-game, it's quite satisfying. Oh and the music and visuals are decent.
Also watch out for Bruce."

12006,"The game loses some function if you play on Peaceful mode, but it's still perfectly enjoyable, you just don't have to fight a shark all the time."
12007,Great building. Can be very relaxing play once you're coasting along on your self-sustaining floating empire. Beautiful art and music!

12009,"awesome swaggy

12010,"fun, no sex tho"
12011,Raft is a pretty chill and simple survival game. So easy to get lost in it for hours. The snap-to building elements are pretty satisfying while still allowing for free placement of most items that aren't structural. Rarely will you find a difficult element besides shifting from always needing a material for cRAFTing and then having an overabundance of them. Replayed this game multiple times as they released chapters and updates before the full release. Will always recommend it.

12027,"Enjoyable and somewhat relaxing story survival game. Very little direction, both in terms of guidance on gameplay mechanics (i.e. using hook to collect sand, scraps, etc.) as well as establishing micro goals (i.e. very open ended ""what are next 2-3 things i should do to progress) but these are not grave issues the detract from an overall good experience.
"
12028,"Raft is a very good game. There's lots of things you can do, and being able to customize how your raft looks is a really great addition. When you play the game, remember to stop at the islands and explore the reefs! That's a crucial part of the game."

Its nice in that there are no bugs that I found, and playing with friends was smooth and seamless. I just did not like the content in the game.

If you want co-op survival, play The Forest, or Ark. Or subnautica for single player."
12042,"I had a really good time with this game. Some of the design is clunky, like having to completely empty a storage chest to move it, making item management a chore. With friends, it was excellent."
12043,Best survival game ever! The 1.0 Update is awesome!
12044,fun survival game to play with friends
12045,See a vast ocean...hook trash...build a bigger raft from trash... run out of wood... build everything from trash...become an eco-warrior... kill a bunch of animals... lose eco-warrior status...run out of wood... cook a soup from the head of an exploding fish... trade in strange specimens to an unmanned trading post... use severed heads and honey to power your raft... discover some genuinely cool places...made a luxury yacht out of crap you found in the ocean... run out of wood... kick it on the deck and listen to the same three songs... find a cassette tape and fix that problem..drive a <redacted>... run out of wood...

12060,"I've been playing this game for a while now - since before Balboa was introduced. Honestly this is one of my top 10 games to date. I am a huge fan of survival crafting games and this one is by far a top tier game; the balancing of your character needs, resource gathering, and combat are fairly even throughout the buffer periods of the story. Each story island has a unique puzzle to combat ratio. Sometimes the game lacks in guidance on where to proceed, but overall the experience is very balanced. Well done! 8/10"

I want to say this is a very low key game, but you are constantly doing something, be it hunting for materials or building... which leaves you hunting for materials... Just, be mindful of the pucker fish,"
12066,.
12067,"I remember when this game was little more than a free phone game, and all you could build was a grill and a water purifier, and it's awesome to see how far it has come since. Even playing alone, there is meaningful progression and a neat story to discover. Make the game as easy or hard as you want, build the raft as big and tall as you want, it's all up to you. More fun with friends, hop on discord if you don't wanna play alone, there's always someone looking to start a new adventure!"

12114,enjoyable playthrough
12115,Played since early access. Great game with a unique take on the gameplay. Fun with friends and also allows for both story playthrough but also a sandbox feel by upgrading your raft and adventuring to new islands to collect resources.

12125,"Fun, but a bit of a challenge. This isn't bad at all, you just have to be more aware of the environment. Islands are rare and supplies are always changing direction with the currents so you could be in a good flow of materials for a time, then have nothing at all. I haven't gotten onto the islands too much and have not been able to progress the story yet. I know the story takes you to some interesting areas and I am looking forward to them, I just need to get a better gathering system going. I have been watching this game for a while, but only recently bought it and played it some."
12126,"started playing with my friends, super fun! never ran out of things to do and the graphics are amazing"
12127,nice game
12128,good
12129,"Start with a tiny raft of four modest squares lashed together from repurposed wood and air-filled plastic jugs... a simple plastic hook on a rope that you can use to pull in more planks, plastic, leaves for making rope, the occasional tasty barrel that might contain a few bits of metal scrap or something to eat; some rocks to make an improvised anchor, letting you explore one of the little islands you'll eventually drift by in the Eternal Trash Stream that is Raft's world.

Boil the salt out of some water (or evaporate fresh water out of the salt, rather?) and you'll stave off dehydration. Roast a few barrel beets and you won't starve. Craft a rod and do some fishing, maybe. You'll want a pointy stick to fend off sharks trying to chomp your raft to pieces so they can eat you. Later you might accumulate enough materials to reinforce that raft foundation so you don't have to worry about the sharks so much. Other things will still try to kill you, of course... but hey, if you manage to come out on top, most of them will make a decent meal.

In time, your raft will grow as you mold it to your will. Wider, maybe? Gives you more room to maneuver and catch those sneaky barrels drifting by too far out. Or maybe you'd rather build upwards, get a little range boost for your junk-hook that way. Maybe you're looking to build yourself a floating dream house, a cute floating cabin, a sea-faring farm, or a mighty ship. You can paint the walls and floors in a variety of colors, and there are loads of things to put on board; storage, smelters, grills, water purifying equipment, planters for flowers, fruits and entire trees. Just about anything you could want, as long as you can find or discover the crafting recipe, it's probably in here somewhere.

There's a haunting beauty and atmosphere in the sunrise, sunset... the motion of the waves, the rocking and tilting of your raft out there on the wide blue ocean. The sound and music add to this, for an often relaxing experience (if you can suppress those pesky urges to Do, to Gather, to Accomplish, long enough to just enjoy these special moments of peace).

Following the game's full release, I can also say that the story is decent enough. You'll visit many places, explore on land and in the water, make use of the best equipment you can craft and some food and water supplies as you roam the larger locations. At times, this becomes a bit of a chore; platform-jumping challenges are not for everyone, nor are the scavenger hunts for specific (sometimes a bit tricky to locate) objects on rooftops and whatnot. Generally, there is a way to get wherever you need to, but it can get a little frustrating at times. There are also a number of puzzles to solve in order to progress through the later locations. These are... mostly fine, and can feel rewarding to figure out, but feel free to just look up solutions if you feel they're not enjoyable for you. Since blueprints and schematics for many of the game's key objects, furnishings and equipment items are found in the story/puzzle areas, they are rather necessary if one wishes to experience all the game has to offer.

The game can be enjoyed alone, or with friends, which is always a plus. Better still, more than four players can share the same raft (if you have that many people you want to go rafting with), making it a somewhat rare co-op opportunity.

All in all, highly recommended for anyone who thinks they might enjoy a mostly relaxing survival/crafting game revolving around a nomadic raft person's quest for survival and understanding, adrift on the great, wide ocean of life."

raft is an amazing survival game it has so many good features and graphics! but if ur on a big raft your fps drops a little.
its abit like minecraft but on water!

12152,good game
12153,"There is something about this game that is just light hearted fun to play. Playing in a group just adds to that, well you know what they say, many hands make light work. It can be a little tedious at the very beginning but once youve got the hang of it and develop your raft it gets better and better. 
I just wish they would never stop adding more chapters!

12165,"Very Cool Survival Game

"
12166,A great game for single or 2 player. Lots of fun building ya raft and exploring the islands. The story has got some funny little bits to it. We love to replay from start and make it better each time. If you are playing as a couple you will argue over layout and storage but that's all part of the fun.
12167,One of the best survival game

12222,"Played a lot of survival games, but this one feels like work. You can't think about what to do next because you are just constantly struggling for enaugh food and water. The character eats like 30 fish a day.
Also, this game makes my cpu want to explode. Goes up by 30+°C just by starting the game and being at 10% load."
12223,One of the better Survival Games
12224,ok
12225,"Very very solid game for it's price, it offers dozens, if not hundreds of hours of great content and replayability"
12226,"I started playing Raft in 2020. Right before the Taronga chapter came out and adored it. The aesthetic, the world building, and the fact that the story being hinted at was generally a really interesting one. I cannot tell you how disappointed I am with the final chapter. Both of the new story islands felt smaller than everything that had come before them, with less exploration and less world building. Not to mention the changes they made to what story they had. Everything just felt so rushed, like they were trying to get me to the end of the game as soon as possible. 

Not to mention the sudden addition of platforming and boss fights, both of which were done rather poorly, especially given how clunky combat is, which is a lot easier to overlook for most of the game because he enemies aren't as big of a deal. 

The addition of the trading posts makes no sense. And only one of the blueprints they sell actually has any benefit other than aesthetic.

Also? what am i supposed to do once i beat the game? Does it basically become a sand box to run around in? Does Utopia still need anything? The finale just felt so lackluster

All in all, it really suck to watch a game i really enjoyed be basically ruined by a shoehorned ending."
12227,"This game was fun when I played it with my friends and its overall a really well designed game. It's best played with friends and if you do have friends, play this game with them."
12228,fun with friends and without
12229,I really like this game. still have some ''bug'' in multiplayers but so mutch fun to play with a partner. The story is interestin and we can play with out alwais follow the story. nice game.  (sorry for my bad anglish)

12253,gud game. fun. play
12254,"Solo play review - repetitive game play. And the god damn Shark is like the end game boss from start to finish. Its like every 5 minutes stop doing everything you are doing and go tend to this. Its like those games that force a sleep cycle - where you cannot play without having some time passed by as part of game mechanics. The shark is easy to kill but it takes time - and no way around it, I haven't played it long enough to see if there are any weapons that one hit that thing.
Great idea - but its not meant to be played by single player - you will be bored to death and restarting over and over till you realize what is the point?"
12255,very sick experience now that it's finished
12256,Moon Bio Dome 10/10
12257,It is fun to play with friends and it can get a little addicting sometimes.
12258,"Original Post after 3 hours:
My opinion could change with time but as of now, I'm annoyed at this games limited settings.
I want a challenging experience with penalties for death. Normal and hard mode offer this but dying once in normal destroys your resources and sets you up to starve in just over 10 minutes landing you with yet another death and even fewer resources.
Playing on easy would solve this problem but then you lose nothing for dying. There is no risk and nothing is stopping me for diving, grabbing rare loots, and then dying to insta-teleport to the raft.
I've had to abandon 3 worlds in 2 hours because of how punishing the deaths are and how hard it is to recover post death.
I want to like this game... But I'm starting to regret my time with it..
Negative for now, we will see if that changes.

Edit: 
Alright... First off, I was wrong. No way around it. I still feel the early game is a steep learning curve, but after you settle into a rhythm of Salvage > Refill Water Purifier > Harvest Plants > Stab Raft Eating Shark > Repeat, The game becomes a bit more manageable. The grind ran a bit long for me and that is why my first opinion of the game was so negative.

That all changed after I came across my first large island. Soon, I was finding blueprints and resources that made managing the raft and my  resources not only easier, but much more fun. I began to hit the milestones others have mentioned here on the comments such as my first sail, first Advanced Grill, and the oh so sweet first Shark kill. Building new weapons and tools lead me to constructing the radio...

Let me tell ya folks, after 6 hours of barely surviving and struggling to improve my raft and gear, Seeing that Sea outpost appearing on the horizon gave me chills. After clambering aboard and climbing to the top, I get my first taste of the story of Raft. After all that, I can safely say I'm hooked.

The early game is rough and I legit wanted to quit after my first review. I'm so glad I didn't! I will be riding the surf for the foreseeable future. My advice to folks having a tough time? Stick with it. I cant put into words what seeing that second plot location did to me. I encourage everyone to experience that same feeling!"

12264,"This is one of my favorite games it has a very good storyline going to location after location finding the lore of why it is abandoned and now with the final chapter out it has an ending that I encourage you go for. Is raft still not a game for you? You don't need to go to story line locations and just play as a survival game and not to mention you can play with friends that make this game very fun or you can play solo, it doesn't matter you can still have fun either way. Not only that there are difficulties such as creative or peaceful that you can play as a sandbox game. This is a very good game in my opinion :D."

12270,"FALSE ADVERTISING!

I like survival crafting games, this looked like a pretty chill game. It is not. Even in the easiest mode your character is constantly running out of food, if you don't eat something every minute you die from starvation. Getting enough fresh water is super easy ironically, but you will have a shark nomming at your raft and be constantly dying of hunger even in normal mode."

12274,"So the first few islands are great, and the survival mechanics, while a bit of a grind, aren't bad and can actually be fun.  The first few updates of the game were also very enjoyable.  My wife and I have played through the early stages of the game multiple times, and really enjoyed all the improvements and new content.  A few weeks ago I would have emphatically recommended this game to everyone.  

However, the latest release is a total departure from the core game play which is essentially ""surviving on the raft"", hence the name ""Raft"".  The plot is nonsensical, but in the early releases really didn't matter much as it really didn't affect game play.  The new section of the game forces you to pay attention and it's not worth it.  Worse the last three islands are jam packed with meaningless time wasters and ill-contrived puzzles.  

To put it plainly, the ""final"" release breaks the original feel of the game so badly that it taints the rest of the experience.  It started out as Robinson Crusoe at see and ends up... well for the sake of not spoiling anything I won't finish that statement.  I'll just add that at one point it becomes a platformer, and I will spoil this, the control and collision system is not accurate enough for *any kind* of fun platforming experience.

It feels as if the devs got bored making a survival game and crammed in a bunch of content that simply doesn't fit.  Seriously, there are highly mechanical boss fights now, extremely annoying platforming, slap-dash puzzles and poorly implemented control systems.

I may be wrong, and this might have been the plan all along.  If so, it wasn't a good plan."

12277,"I love that there are different difficulties.
I do wish there was a true ""pause"" option though.
There needs to be an ""un-stuck"" option for when your raft gets stuck up on an island. (I'm aware paddles help with that, but it's still annoying)
The customization features are pretty great. very versatile and creative."

12294,fun game in multiplayer
12295,"I adore this game <3 

As an adventure game, as a base builder, as a survival game - it's fun no matter what your aim is. Plus, the story enhancements that come out in chapters always add to it and slowly start to answer the question of why the heck you're on a raft collecting garbage. End of the day? It's fun to collect garbage! It can get a little grindy if you aren't playing with friends, but even then there are tools to help you get ahead of the collection and you still have full control over everything. I'm a little amazed how well it runs with some of the ridiculous rafts we've come up with, even if the shark lags a little bit from time to time. 

The new updates are great and Rhino scared the air right out of me - really looking forward to adding all the new goodies and I hope there's continued additions!"

12315,"Initially, Raft unequivocally captures the hopeless loneliness of being lost at see, all while drifting in an expansive, ""Water World"" style, and beautifully-crafted environment. Scrambling for any salvage possible to stay alive, or rushing on to a small islet while your raft drifts slowly by will at first have you recognizing the challenges of survival. Soon enough, you'll find yourself thinking about drifting aimlessly at sea throughout your day - makes me want to work remote...

Pro:
- Gorgeous, tropical environments.
- Challenge is scale-able (pre-start) and milestones are satisfying.
- Thorough crafting/building/survival system.
- Story is well thought-out and is driven periodically. Updated, and quite a feeling of mystery.
- Multiplayer updated and extremely fun.

Con:
- Scale of difficulty modes is still shifted incorrectly towards ""hard as hell"" and way off. Consider starting on ""Peaceful"" if you want easy, and ""Easy"" if you want normal-level difficulty. 
- Multiplayer only recently updated, could use more quality of life improvements."

12317,"people have been saying that this game is great solo or with friends, but im gonna have to disagree, if you dont play this game with friends you will spend a lot of time grinding just to stay alive, but with even one more friend, only one person has to focus on food

overall though, i love this game. it's so unique and a good choice among the sea of crap in this genre"
12318,"mmmmmm
"
12319,"unless i'm playing arcanoid, i'd expect game to uphold to some core rules, to establish world you can immerse yourself into. raft fails on that: rules does not make any sense, artificial restrictions, ""game mechanics"" this, ""game mechanics"" that, blahblah. why does shark always there around raft, why does it attack every 5 minutes like a clock? why do we have to use hook to pick up sand/clay and only from particular spots? whom are we trading to on deserted islands? whom are we gaining ""reputation"" with, with noone witness us around? why those trading posts are ""off-limits"", whereas anything else around is free for taking?

I played with 4+ friends at any given time and it was always fun as hecc. 10/10 co-op game!"
12345,Great game
12346,"I am recommending this game for a casual playthru, but as a completionist this game is infuriatingly tedious without mods to spawn in mobs. Even then it's pretty rough. There is no middle ground option, and I did enjoy my time so I'm gonna keep it as a positive. If you're just going through the motions especially with friends to complete the story then you'll get a slow burn until you start to get upgrades and that's when the games feels a lot smoother.

A lot of the areas are pretty interesting albeit a bit obnoxious to navigate seeing as your movement speed is pretty much non-existent without the speed food introduced in 1.0. Combat is pretty simple, and definitely not the mainstay. Customization of the Raft is pretty top notch and you can make some incredible things. Once you get everything set it really feels like home.

One of my biggest gripes is you get the best upgrades/items AFTER you beat the game. Which honestly is the worst time seeing as if you don't plan on 100%ing the game you won't be playing much more after that as islands don't have much to offer outside of a friendly animal to grab and digging spots for Titanium. Which only becomes useful late, but you can become so self-sufficient you won't need it, but it's nice to have.

All in all I really enjoyed the game, but I'd be lying if I said the achievements and going for everything I could really got draining fast. I had to frequently take breaks out of boredom and frustrating from just floating around hoping the right island/items would pop up. Unfortunately a lot of mechanics basically require you to wait for a while, and micro-manage your raft."

12352,"Raft is a fun game at times, incredibly boring and grindy at times.  

There has been progress since its early releases, but honestly it's just barely coming up to ""okay"" status after years in development. Some of the ""exploration"" gets very repetitive, and some of the story areas are just boring, mediocre ""search everything and mash E"" gates on progression.  

If you play without friends, it can have large periods of time where you're just... doing chores.  

That's kinda the problem. At one point everything you do just feels like chores.  

That being said, if you play with friends it is a truly fun experience. But that could be said of any other sandboxy/survival games.  

Is it worth the money? Probably.
Is it as good as it could be? Not really."

It has also taught me which of my friends to trust if I am ever stranded in the middle of the ocean. I built a shed for a friend who does not play this game. I then put an outhouse in the shed."

12365,Must have game.
12366,"Amazing and addictive! This is a lot of fun playing solo or with friend(s). If you're into survival games and you think you might like being on the Ocean, hopping from island to island, collecting resources, building your raft, and even following a story then you'll probably get hooked on this like me. There are many ways to build your raft, a lot of things to unlock and collect in this game, and it will keep you busy for hours. It is a grind when playing solo, but I didn't mind that much and when I played online my game would lag sometimes (and I have really fast internet), so it does have a couple minor flaws."
12367,good if you like survival games but it's better to play with friends
12368,raft = good
12369,there was a raft
12370,In my opinion it's really interesting and depth-plot game and i really really recommend it
12371,only played it briefly but found it to boring
12372,"This game is kinda fun playing solo, it's relaxing... until you get killed by a wild boar, lose 2/3 of your stuff, spawn back on your raft and a bird drops a rock on your head and your inventory is empty...

definitely play this with friends if you wanna do the story cus solo gets boring."

12374,"Woke up on a piece of wood, survived for a long time, found some kind of secret facility, explored it, found funni enemies, died, then i woke up and got to play this game and do it all over again. 11/10 would eat shark again."
12375,float on boat
12376,10/10 would stab a shark in the face again
12377,"Of all the games I have ran on my computer, and that's easily more than 200, this is the only one that managed to crash the whole PC while trying to join another player's world.

The first few times it crashed alongside Discord, but I figured I could just try again and it would work sometimes and load the world correctly, so I could still play it.

As of today, the whole system crashed at the same point where only the game and maybe Discord usually did during loading, and I had to restart the PC, as nothing else would work.

All my specs are well above the recommended ones, and as no other games have managed to do this, I don't believe it's a problem with my PC.

It's just not possible to gamble with crashing my system every time I load into a world, so unfortunately, until I hear this specific problem is somehow fixed, I'll have to stop playing the game.

It's a shame, as playing multiplayer was actually kind of a fun way to kill some time."
12378,"extremely fun, especially with a friend or even boyfriend in my case! we occasionally googled some things and other times we discovered it on our own! I enjoy the game."

12384,I would definitely recommend this game to anyone wanting that crafting/survival experience BUT ON A RAFT. Only downside is that the game has horrible flickering if played on a widescreen monitor (almost refunded it because of that!). Highly recommended to be played with friends.

12411,"Devs kept making design choices that made the game more grindy instead of more fun. Now that 1.0 is out I've lost hope they will address this. If you love the genre its worth about 10 bucks, but by the time you have to use titatnium as a crafting material the grind is so bad it stops being fun. There are better survival crafting games out there."

Really meant for multiplayer.  Singleplayer just has a lot of busy work and an early game curve that kinda sucks.

Many of the early threatening animals are just a bit too irritating to deal with.  Boars and Birds can easily kill you when all you have is a pointy stick.  Not a problem in an of itself, but when dying means that you instantly lose 2/3rds of your (again, in the early game) scarce inventory.  It's not dropped, so if you can brave whatever killed you it's possible to reclaim it. Just gone.
In multiplayer you can rescue each other, but that's no help to the solo player.  I can't comment on the mid game, as I haven't seen much of it since the 1.0 release.

I played it earlier in development and found the busywork a little grating, not to mention the initial process of feeding and watering yourself quite tight — but I thought that these might be smoothed a little in the main release.  Nope.  That's' just how things are meant to be.

None of the above are complete dealbreakers. However, the fact of the matter is that you spend so much of your time doing very dull things just to keep your head above water (har har) that after the third or so death I had to ask myself ""do I actually *want* to respawn and do this all again?
As it turns out, no.  No I didn't.

[strike]It's quite probable that as a multiplayer game, this is lessened and fun.  Unfortunately as I've had a very so-so experience, I don't feel able to recommend it to friends in order to find out.[/strike]

Addendum:

I have since played Raft with a friend and, yep, it's a lot more fun with friends.
The busy work is cut in half and because you can focus your efforts the extra mouths to feed/water are no concern at all.  What's more, because you are spending your time chatting away with each other — plotting on what to do next, etc — you don't notice how much busywork you are doing.

I still stand by my review for singleplayers, but I feel able to say that it's worth it in multiplayer, as long as you aren't looking for high octane gaming or mind doing repetitive tasks.  Because, boy, you still do a lot of that.

I'm not going to change the ""verdict"" of the review, as I think the singleplayer viewpoint is probably underrepresented in the reviews at large."
12448,kinda boring but its fun
12449,"i love raft, and i love playing it with friends, however solo is another experience in and of itself. everything was fine until caravan town when i went to get the final zipline piece from the rocket. well i went to grab it and it never spawned in my inventory. i did a trick the community said of reloading the area by sailing away from the island then comming back, well it didnt work. now im stuck on caravan town without a way to advance. the worst part is this has been a known bug in the game for 3 years and they still havent fixed it. so until they fix the bug im stuck unless i start a brand new game from the very start which took me several hours to get to where i was. someone told me to use mods to bypass it but i refuse. i shouldnt have to rely on mods to bypass a known bug in the game. 
devs fix this stupid bug, only then will i change my review."

12454,"The game autosaves upon death and even though a lot of people would argue that this is typical for a survival game, you lose 2/3 of your inventory with no way of recovering it. And it's 2/3 of EVERYTHING, not just you lose some items and keep others. You now have 1/3 durability on ALL of your tools and weapons and 1/3 of any stack of anything you had in your inventory. I had like 7 titanium ores and dying bc I got ganged up on by a Screecher and a Boar brought me down to 2! Come the fuck on man!"
12455,final version is great with friends
12456,:thumbs_up:
12457,I just remembered how much I love this game but Hate the Pufferfish
12458,"Raft is released in a beta state. It's got way too much rough edges to be considered a complete game.

The number of ""random"" islands you can encounter while floating is very limited (i think there's only like 4 small and 2 large islands?) so you quickly see repetitions.

Endless nuisance from seagulls and sharks that you must put down whatever you're doing and respond within seconds. They are not realistic, they are not challenging, they are not fun. Just plain annoying. They are the worst part of this game.

When you're hungry the game constantly (as in, with no delay in between) makes the stomach growling sound, extremely annoying. hard to believe this stayed for a game that's been in EA for so long.

Combat feels like remembering how to cheese everything (because it's way too impractical otherwise).

In general the game lacks directions telling you how it works, but none of it is for immersion or realism: the game makes it very clear with how recipes and research table works, that it is just a game."

12464,AMAZIN
12465,"The game seems fun and interesting, but once you stop having to constantly search for food/water and wood/plastic you realize there's nothing more to do other than wait literal hours for extremely boring ""lore"" notes and decorate your raft if you give a shit about that. Nothing poses a threat to you once you learn how to easily avoid taking any damage from animals. It took 4 years to get the game to this state and it still feels like an unfinished and unpolished game lmao

They forced the game to be online-only in the 1.0 update because they realized how boring the game is"

12470,"Almost good, played quite a lot up until v 1.0
Sadly, poor design choices leave me disappointed. What started as an exploration/puzzle survival game ended up with some heavy fighting. It wouldn't be a problem if not for unity, which can't handle that kind of gameplay properly. Add to that a stupid save system, and you have a recipe for an ""almost good"" game."

12476,"Fun concept based on 3 things:
1. surviving on raft
2. evading or killing sharks who stalk you and love to eat wood
3. fishing for garbage to build things on your floating home

Some complaints:
1. hunger and thirst go down a bit too fast for my liking, feels like there's not even time to walk 100 paces before I have to mash a coconut or melon in my face again
2. islands are too sparse (feels like there's not much to do) and you can't pick up rocks and stuff on the ground unless you and the thing you're trying to pick up is fully submerged - and why can't I cut more trees? the islands would feel more compelling if there was more to do other than swim around it collecting ore
3. feels like you spent a lot more time floating and have to collect a lot of stuff before you can progress so it feels a bit grindy 
4. seagulls are assholes  

Still, fun game, recommend on sale. It is early yet, so maybe there's more that I haven't uncovered."

12479,its been a lot of fun with my friends and my boyfriend. It's very engaging and keeps you on your toes.
12480,"Very fun game for those Survival/building fanatics (like me). Won't spoil anything, but your on a raft floating endlessly through water. You'll find some islands with a few random materials (food/wood/etc).

There's a bit of a learning curve, but it's not steep.

Foundational support needs some reworking. I build columns/beams and sometimes it doesn't recognize the support so I'll have this weird hole or a bunch of random columns standing in my room. Even though it's supported on ALL sides/corners...."
12481,Chill and Fun
12482,"If you have the right people to play this with, its the best game ever.
If you have the wrong friends, worst game."
12483,"One of the most charming survival and co-op games I have played in a long time. The co-op functions fantastically, the world is easy to understand and the crafting has some depth but isn't too cumbersome. The enemies can be a little tough if you are playing solo without some decent gear, everything is tailored for a multiplayer experience. The story is a little short but well scripted and the story locations are all hand crafted to excellent attention to detail. Build the raft of your dreams."

12489,"only 20hrs in but its been a great experience so far, must-own for anyone who loves crafting survival, can be played alone but its better with friends"
12490,Sh1ty experience
12491,"So, the tl;dr before I get into my review is that the game is worth playing, I had a hard time putting it down for seventy hours, I loved building my raft and the overall art direction is great. However, I feel that as an actual overall experience my opinion is mixed at best.

Pros:
- The build system is fantastic, probably one of the better ones I've ever used hands down. There's tons of interesting things to decorate with and the aesthetic is well crafted.
- Collecting resources isn't an insanely irritating grind, once you get a decent collection system set up the resources will mostly collect themselves barring swimming in the reefs which is actually pretty fun and you don't need to do it constantly you get a lot of good resources from the story areas.
- The characters are really diverse and interesting, and I like that you follow them through the story.
- The world design and world building is cool, I love the art direction, every area felt unique and I was always excited to see the next one.

Cons
- For some reason if your boat is moving slowly trash stops spawning, the game doesn't tell you what's happening and at first I thought it was a mechanic and was telling me to be more self-sufficient before realizing that the wind had changed, but it's an issue because you need resources to eat and get water in the early game. At the least, there should be some kind of prompt to let me know what's happening.
- I switched my game to peaceful within an hour because a lot of the mechanics to make your survival feel more desperate are actually just incredibly irritating. I found it almost impossible to focus on the parts of the game I wanted to play because I was too busy hitting the shark for the zillionth time because he comes Every Five Minutes, or the stupid birds, it just felt like I was babysitting every last thing on my ship. I like the idea of there being environmental challenges, but they've been implemented in such a way that it's mostly just an annoyance.
- Why is the sprint so slow. It truly annoyed me for seventy hours it never stopped annoying me.
- The tonal change from building your raft and exploring random islands to the story areas is incredibly jarring for multiple reasons. For one, it feels like an entirely different game, you go from resource management survival to,,, mediocre puzzles in claustrophobic spaces filled with creatures that are often jump scaring you???? Even in Peaceful I found going through the story areas to be stressful and frustrating as the puzzles aren't intuitive and being trapped in the dark with rats is like, the opposite of a good time. Now scary games are fine, except that the other ninety percent of this game isn't scary so going in blind it was a surprise I did Not enjoy. Two, the story areas just don't feel like they had enough player testing or iterating, at some point in every area I had to google what to do because the level design was confusing and there weren't great cues for what I was even trying to DO in them, and I always had a moment at the end where I'd just pause in confusion before realizing ""oh that was the ending, im done here"". I suspect the reason it feels so weird is that the game was probably originally designed around the raft mechanic, so the story probably feels tacked on because,, it was.
- The puzzles need their own point because genuinely everything about them annoyed me. They were somehow always the same set of elements but also insanely confusing and involved So Much Backtracking given that you walk so slowly and there's like five different timed mechanics running out like all the time. I'd get partially through and realize I needed to eat and drink, I'd have to go back to my raft because my light died again, my oxygen bottle would break, the flippers wore out, I'd be trying to figure out a laser mechanic and my hazard suit which was Also Timed For Some Reason would ALSO RUN OUT. There would be yet another weird, mutated creature hiding around a corner to scare the shit out of me when I just wanted to put a stupid key in some stupid door that took me thirty minutes to find because it was stashed in a random corner I had to google to find. It felt like the puzzles were mostly just put there to drag out play time and make the story areas feel like they had more substance than they actually did. If they weren't going to put quality time into making good puzzles I would've rather just not had them.
- After a while the randomly spawning islands got repetitive, more variation in the islands would've been great, and would've tied in better with the core mechanic instead of it feeling weirdly divorced from the story I think, which did have a lot of cool variety.

Overall, it sounds incredibly negative because the parts I didn't enjoy I REALLY didn't enjoy, but the parts I liked I really loved or I wouldn't have finished the game, so take my critique with a grain of salt I still had a lot of fun."

""In version 1.0, we blocked players who were not connected to an internet connection from playing."". They blocked people from playing a SINGLE PLAYER game from playing if they weren't online with an internet connection. Now I don't know about anyone else, but that is just asinine. I understand this game has online elements such as multiplayer, but that is just silly. And while they did reverse that choice, I still find it highly silly that this is even an issue with this game. They claim the reasoning is it caused bugs and issues, which sounds like a complete load."

12519,This game is lots of fun especially with friends. The story is interesting and the gameplay feels great. Some of the rafts that can be created are just phenomenal. It's a gorgeous game.

12527,"Cannot recommend this game because of two issues I have:
1. The 1.0 update forced the game to be online-only; You literally cannot play the game in offline mode.
2. The game is not balance for single player and always need a teammate I don't have and I really want to play this single."

12529,"Amazing game. Waited for it to release to 1.0 and cant be more thrilled with the end result. 

PROs:
Survival experience is rewarding and you can feel the sense of progression as you advance and build your raft
Co-op play through has been flawless, with no bugs or issues
Building and crafting is simple, yet very satisfying
Each new location brings a little part to the story that doesnt take away from the overall experience or remove you from the idea that you are still just floating on a raft.
25hours+ and still loving the simple things like collecting planks or stopping at islands
Game runs SMOOTH on just about any updated system
Although the graphics arent spectacular, the sunsets and sunrises are sometimes breathtaking
I am not someone who usually spends time making my survival experience look good with decorations and design, but its so simple in Raft that I have spent plenty time just making my raft look that little bit better

Cons:
Mod support would be incredible for more re-playability

Conclusion:
This game is a MUST if you are looking for a game to play with a friend. I cant say how to solo experience is, but I assume pretty much just as good. An amazing game that I would love everyone to try!"

12531,"Another survival game with the gimmick of being stuck on a raft, with a special shark who hates everything human built stalking you. After a good chunk of playing it in different stages of EA, I got bored and ultimately gave up after dying to the damn bird dropping rocks, twice in the span of a few minutes. FIghting a warthog was okay, but getting bombarded by the bird and instagibbed the very second after I respawned on my raft on other side of the island made me lose my bow and all the arrows, as well as nearly every other non common resource and my motivation to continue this bare bones survival with artificial difficulty that serves perfectly well as an ADHD test."
12532,"Remember......




First you go to the 0 floor and only then you go to the 2nd."
12533,simple and fun
12534,"TLDR: This game is good for your mental health.

Big up for Raft. If you want to just float around, chilling on the ocean and building up your boat, doing some decorating, cooking, fishing, eating a whole watermelon - it's got you. But when you're feeling up to it, you can dive down into colourful reefs, stab the shark, get angry at some birds and start uncovering the main plot. I haven't gotten all that far into said main plot just yet, but if all this game did was offer me a boat and the endless ocean, I'd still be recommending it.

NGL, I'm one depressed sea-hag right now, and Raft has been helping me escape into a calmer space. 
11/10, will redesign my whole boat from scratch again."

12547,Great enjoyable and full game!
12548,good product
12549,Superbe jeu entre amis
12550,"Really fun game. My friends and I got this game during one of those dry spells -- looking for a fun COOP game for the group. Background, we're FPS shooter (Battlefield, Ghost Recon, etc), RTS, and RPG players, so this is a bit of a leap for us. Very quickly we got sucked in learning how to survive and now completing some 65 hours on the game with the recent ""Final Chapter"" patch. We have not run into any real bugs, no game ending balancing issues, etc unlike recent releases. My friends and I could go on for hours in silence just working away in our areas (building, cooking, foraging, repairing, etc). The game style is also sufficiently ""cartoony"" but believable. I think if I were to complain about anything, its more so waiting for the next update and/or wondering how long the devs will support this game. I'm please to see its now in full release!"
12551,"very good game

12552,good game
12553,fun
12554,fortnite balls
12555,make a pool thing you can place on your boat. I want to swim without needing to kill a shark.
12556,good game. do recommend this game but its better with friends
12557,"It's a fun game, The areas you go to look nice and the ability to build out the raft your own way is probably the best part of it. I strongly suggest you play this with a friend, mainly because it's a challenge to do everything (maintaining food, water, building out your raft, etc) by yourself. It's also just makes it a much more funny experience with people"
12558,10/10 love this game so good would 100%  reccomend
12559,add sex please
12560,"What a great game, after playing it for over a year and it now being finished, I can say this was without a question a great game to relax with friends and play, and enjoy the environmental story telling."
12561,AMAZING AND GOES SO DEEP YOULL NEVER GET BORED
12562,makes me want to watch henatai
12563,Tedious the game.
12564,"I quite like this game.  I do wish there were more game options, such as being able to adjust how much time it takes for the shark to come back after being killed and how much tools degrade with use.  Character customisation would also be pretty nice.

Overall it's a fun game, but it still feels like it's in early access.  The most glaring issue is that the first floor of the raft is almost constantly under water, regardless of its size.  It's incredibly annoying visually.  Whatever engine they used for this game really wasn't made for this kind of game."
12565,"After collecting resources and progressing through the story for a dozen hours, making a breakthrough to a new story island, seeing all sorts of new materials, creatures, scenery, when you really just want to embrace the nature of Raft and explore, you encounter a bear. 

The bear is easy to kill, barely even hurt you, and you get some good loot! You walk 15 feet down the path and find another bear but this one one-shots you from full HP without any warning wiping a few hours worth of materials out instantly, forcing you to leave the island behind to get more resources before coming back and repeating the whole process. This game can suck my left nut.



Edit: After re-reading my review, I realize I come off as salty and one-dimensional in my complaints. The game has a small list of problems that I'm disappointed to see are still in the game upon full release. 

First, the technical problems. Everything is centered around your original 2x2 raft. If you get stuck on an island, you cannot even build a new raft, the game is not coded to be able to handle you creating a new raft so they don't even give you the option to do so. If you expand your original 2x2 raft into a 40x40, I hope you did so in every direction because resources spawn around the original 2x2. If you expanded purely to the right, you will see all of your loot passing you on the left. Sharks, the recurring enemy in this game, will only stay within a certain range of your original 2x2 raft. If you swim far enough away, suddenly the oceans are dead. If you are far enough away from your raft, like on an island as it sailed away, things will start to despawn, including the island you are standing on.

Alongside this, inventory management is abysmal, its not always clear where resources come from (wool from llamas but not sheep?), and the lack of multiplayer scaling actually makes this game annoying to play with four people. There's just not enough resources to spread that thin.

The game is solid, its high review rate reflects that, but I am very disappointed to see very obvious mistakes in the design of this game still reach full release."
12566,"i just like the asthetic and the feeling when your alone on a Saturday night and you are just in the middle of the ocean, when the music kicks in, the feeling that go's down my spine in that moment is something you can't get from just any game. This game legit makes me feel calm and like there's some peace to world.
But those are my favorite moments, there are still times when you make progress in the game or beat a boss that feel really successful. One thing to note is this game has never bean particularly challenging. Everything you do feels less fulfilling because it's not hard, but i don't mind this, as at the end of the day I still really enjoy this game, and believe that it can be fun to all old, young, casual gamers, competitive gamers, exc. It has some spot for everyone, although it clearly is targeted at a more casual audience this game is still really enjoyable. But idk this is just coming from some 13 year old that doesn't get much sun light. I would still recommend buying it just to see how you feel about it."
12567,e
12568,Good Game Yes Yes Yes
12569,good
12570,When i first got it i did not expect to like it this much after playing it and getting deep into the game story. im hoping there would be more updates for more stories.
12571,"The game itself is a lot of fun - however there are a few performance issues. In my opinion, the game is not as optimised as it should be, and takes up far more resources than you'd expect from a game of this kind.

Also, if you find the game boring - try play it with friends! imo it's a far better experience with others."
12572,Bussin on guru game
12573,"We know where we are, We know who we are, who we are"
12574,This is a game about being stuck in the ocean just like Tom Hanks except the volleyball reproduced and grew into Pablo and Tyrone. It was very fun time and I'd recommend it to all shark lovers. Very fun for the friends and family to prep them for swim class
12575,"Absolutely wonderful game. Play it with friends, play it solo, no matter what it is fun."
12576,good game was fun
12577,raft

12579,"i love this game
"
12580,Very nice good stuff for me and my freinds we like very much yes
12581,you should buy it
12582,This game is surprisingly amazing
12583,"This is honestly one of the best base building games i've ever played. I feel the devs, every step of of the way asked ""But is it fun?"" whenever they are about to add something. 

Place a wall, floor or object.. it just works. There is zero reason any other base builder should have issues with their main feature if this game exists. I can build and entire skyscraper on a moving ocean and not have to worry about wear and tear, weight or if the ground is straight enough. 

Once you get certain things, all the hazards go away. Reinforce your raft, shark doesn't eat it anymore. Get a special scarecrow, seagulls just don't eat your crops anymore. The game just wants you to have fun."
12584,My friend kicked me for breaking a wood plank under his feet casting him into the ocean and won't allow me back in.
12585,so much fun!!!
12586,best fishing game
12587,4/5
12588,yes. very good game. build big raft. no! shark eat raft. ooo... island. Island good. Game good. Build big raft. sail. Build anchor. stop at island. make bed. sleepy time in bed. get up in morning. purify ocean water. stab shark so they don't eat raft anymore! expand raft...
12589,bruce :)
12590,shark haha
12591,fuck your deads??
12592,"Fun for <$20. I'd say the game would be overpriced at $25, though. It doesn't do any one thing overly well but doesn't do anything poorly either. Combat and the Scrap Hook take some learning, but it's not an overly difficult game. Puzzles are pretty tough sometimes, but that's the hook of the game really. I didn't find myself falling in love with the building or farming system, and Rafts begin to feel awkward once they get too big. 

The co-op exists, but isn't really a feature of the game. The modding community is small but vital to making this title more playable. I found myself piling on the mods trying to make parts of the game less punishing. I also was recommended to play the game on easy due to food/water requirements, and that was solid advice.

The games fault comes in its desire to be a challenging game instead of a fun, puzzle solving, open world mystery. Thankfully you can fix this with some light-medium modding."
12593,good game mm yes
12594,good game
12595,"Meh. Collect stuff, fight off a shark, collect stuff, build stuff, then get killed by birds with rocks, lose stuff. Repeat."
12596,"Stranded with friends, would be stranded again!"
12597,"10/10

It has no water

I hate games with water"
12598,"POKE THE SHARK
F*** THE BIRDS
GET WOOD"
12599,Raft is my favorite game I love being stranded in the middle of the ocean with my good friends and also the shark I guess
12600,"Very enjoyable game! Very minor spoilers ahead (technique spoilers, not story spoilers).

The survival element is implemented well, though I might use one of the easier modes after my first play through as feeding yourself can get a bit grindy. Food does NOT go bad though so at least there's that! Also note that if you die, you lose all items you carry. This caused me quite a bit of annoyance when trying to learn how to fight bears which are far from your spawn point. After using a ton of time and resources and dying maaaaany times, I ended up looking it up online which I dislike doing.

Combat is very simple (click to stab) but challenging, as each foe has it's own attack rhythm that you'll need to learn to take them out and not die yourself. You can't outrun any foes, so don't try.

The story elements are interesting and drive you forward to the next encounter. 

Many quality of life mods exist out there, but I was too lazy to implement them. I almost did go hunt down a mod due to the odd inexplicable disintegration of the swim fins and the breathing tank. (You swim with them and therefore they... waste away into nothingness in less than an in-game day... In what universe does that happen?) You need a TON of seaweed to craft a bunch of those two items if you want to complete Varuna Point without guides. 

[b] TLDR: Good game! Very enjoyable minus a few frustrations. If you love survival games, the annoyances likely won't bother you. However, if you're like me and don't like losing your progress, use a mod or two. [/b]"
12601,"Yes. Just, yes."
12602,"I just can't recommend this game, because after so many years, performances are still really, really bad, I never managed to have stable 60fps even in the lowest stettings"
12603,it suck
12604,good
12605,really fun with lots to do
12606,floating on a boat in the middle of the ocean is fun

12610,"weird out of nowhere kinda disappointing ending, but Raft is really"
12611,"Very satisfying survival crafter that has the benefit of letting you bring your base with you as you explore. Environment is gorgeous, resource gathering is fun, and the carnivorous fauna keeps you on your toes."
12612,Game rất hay
12613,eno fo ym etirovaf lavivrus emag!
12614,Really fun game at first. It can get a little boring after a while but with a couple buddies you can still have a good time. Would recommend this game to people who like survival games.
12615,"I know I only gave it the half hour but I just couldn't get hooked to bother doing more. The game is only ""OK"" that's the best I'll give it. I knew being stuck on a raft was gonna be somewhat slow and boring at first but turned out to be twice as bad in my opinion."
12616,"Game is slow moving and can get repetitive. But if you stick with it, it gets better!"

So, overall the game is a fairly great game. You can play it solo or with others. Game mechanics are easy to master and get used to. At points you can just veg out fishing or doing other things on your raft until the tool you're using breaks and the sound snaps you back or the shark snaps you back cause he now munching on some foundation and needs that fiber in his diet.

The story. I like the rework. The voice acting was a wonderful touch to it and it flowed okay until you hit the midway point of Tangaroa. Then it starts to flounder. Varuna Point you get the perspective of a person that mentions some people  from the other islands in passing. You hit Temperance which would look like it'd have lore hidden all over the place but only find notes in the main 'areas' (seriously not only that but not needing some sort of cold protection like how we have the armor? ) then you hit Utopia and it just falls apart. Olof is a crazed military man. Crazed military man always have backup plans. When he backed up to the broken window and fell, I was halfway expecting to see he wasn't there, the key was laying there and he was on a raft hightailing it out of there and it'd then become a chase of Detto telling you about some coordinates and a final showdown at like some military base Olof decided to hide out in. There are still room for more tabs on the journal so maybe there's gonna be dlc, who knows.
As such, the boss fight in Varuna Point. GLORIOUS. I enjoyed puzzling it out thinking maybe I need the shark to ram a barrel or chomp on one (it did that little mouthy thing and my zelda brain went dodongo, feed bombs) only to realize how the pillars looked and letting him do the justice with that.
Alpha? Hatred. After having us puzzle our way through soo much only to get met with 'just hit it with a stick until it dies?' Honestly was a waste, specially with the build up of Alpha (Detto mentions that hyena way back in Caravan Town!) in the notes. We've had to brain all through the game to get to that point. It kinda felt insulting to have this as the final in my opinion.
On to the new items. The only ones I built were the juicer and the windmill. I only used the juicer once and used the windmill the most. I still think the tediousness of grinding for titanium is horrid and honestly with the fact you don't need them to beat the game sort of falls into not worth the effort.
While the island vendors are a nice touch, for a solo play, I wouldn't bother with them specially if you are doing hard mode. Would have been great to be able to sell the 'heads' for bait instead of them just being biofuel fodder as well alas to each their own.
Overall, it's an okay fun game. Potential game to 100% yet I don't see much replay value unless something like DLC is added."
12622,Nice and relaxing
12623,its like terraria without the terraria
12624,A unique concept for a survival game
12625,"Grind-core data collections game at its finest. That aside, I actually don't even like the game at all, even if they weren't attempting to keep my solo game online (and give me the full game for that without bugs) so they could scour my data for profits. And since crafting/survival is my favorite genre of game I can safely say that even without the data scrubbing and resale it's easily the worst one in my collection by far."
12626,Still new to the game but so far the game is fun. The game play it's self does justice to the setting. Good game!
12627,for people who want a great survival experience please get this game. its tons of fun and its addicting to those who do survival games.
12628,"This game is really fun! It's a bit laggy for me, but I do not care. So pretty much, this is one of the best sandbox games I've  played!"

12674,"Haven't been this disappointed in a long time. 

With friends it's okay to play, but the ""final chapter"" is just annoying and disappointing on a different level... or maybe Raft is simply not a game for me. I don't know man"
12675,"I have thalassophobia

10/10 will get left behind and drown again"
12676,"The major theme in the game Raft is the theory of natural selection, the idea that variation in species occurs at random, and only those that are beneficial to the earth remain in the species. The idea of natural selection within Raft is an extremely slow process that occurs over a long period of time and is better described as a series of sesquipedalian events. I have called this principle, by which each slight variation, if useful, is preserved, by the terms of Natural Selection. Furthermore, the developers seem to think that, while useless variations can occur in organisms, natural selection only passes variation on to future generations that are useful, however, I disagree. Natural selection is chance because nothing can be done to influence it. The natural evolution of species takes place in nature and is completely random toward where and when it will happen. Things such as competition, environment, and population size are contributing factors to natural selection. Another characteristic of natural selection is the ruthlessness of its process. This is seen in the shark that constantly attacks your raft in the game for no apparent reason. A species with different variants may have one of the variants completely wiped out due to inefficiencies within a particular variant. Natural selection doesn't have sympathy for creatures that are weak and haven't evolved to utilize their surroundings. Creatures that are not fit, being they cannot effectively reproduce will not survive. Therefore the shark in Raft is rather unrealistic, however, I still found enjoyment in this rural phenomenon of a game."

12682,"Its a great game with friends, I got it for me and gifted a copy to my friend who had wish listed it! Lots of designabilty, its basicly a sandbox game!"
12683,"Overall, the game makes for a solid survival title, definitely worth owning. Twitch and Youtube streamers helped to bring Raft the much-needed attention and critical acclaim since its release. From the thrilling storyline and gameplay that captures the player’s attention, Raft gifts its players gameplay that they will not forget anytime soon. With all of the existing and emerging survival games in the market, Raft stands out as a unique and genuine experience."

12710,"Like many games it has its issues, it's very challenging in single player, and there are some issues in multiplayer involving the hook tool getting stuck in the horizon line and not being able to pick up items as well as the shark attacking through the raft and water glitching through visually. Other then that it's a great game. It illustrates the struggles of being stranded on a raft well."

12727,I never thought being stranded in the middle of the ocean would be such a fun expereince. It might seem tedios at first but starts to become really fun once you get an understanding of this game
12728,yes
12729,cool !
12730,"I have a lot of fun on this game and would recommend getting it, downside that I hope has been fixed since last time I played would be when my raft would go underwater for a few seconds and sometimes I would get bit by the shark because of that so hopefully that has been fixed if that's a bug or it might just be I'm dumb and that's something that happens if you're raft is too wide. I can confirm I have a habit of making more space than I need making it so I have a lot of wasted space and just end up having a very wide raft. Those curious it would be a 16 x 16 in how wide and I would only end up using 7 or 8 spaces. Anyway, now that the story is done I'm going to give it another go and try making the best raft I can and not leave unused space. What has definitely helped me is seeing those with those mega rafts like the Catamaraft video and the TARDIS raft video, definitely gave me ideas on new rafts to make and how to use space I didn't know what to do with previously and finally how to not be a idiot in my room design and how bad it was. So, thank you for the ideas and I would really recommend the game for those who haven't played and hope you'll have as much fun as I did and about to have.

Btw some tips would definitely be nice to make it look more pleasing so please don't hold back and feel free to call me an idiot if my raft going under was a me thing and not a bug because knowing if I'm being dumb and it not the games fault would be nice. To anyone reading this far, sorry for the long read but thank you anyway and hope everyone reading this has a nice day"

12744,"VERY GOOD GAME
"
12745,"This game was entirely unfun. Resource costs are too high and right from the get go it feels like a complete grindfest. I played on normal difficulty and was out of food by the end of the first day; consuming a potato , four watermelons and three trees worth of coconuts and mangoes. With no food left on the island and a dwindling health bar my only option was to kill the shark. This proved to be impossible within the amount of hunger I had left, and the shark seemed to tank my spear hits indefinitely. My last spear broke and I had no more planks and no way of getting any without leaving the island which I had yet to even loot around because of the big dumb shark (A big dumb shark that apparently has infinite respawns? killing that thing over and over to loot stone for 3 minutes sounds mind-numbingly boring). I have no idea why my character has such a voracious appetite? Is it part of the story? does he suffer from an intestinal worm? perhaps an entire colony of them? The game feels poorly refined and if it wasn't for steam refund I would be pretty annoyed at wasting money on it."

12752,"Survival on a raft in the middle of the endless ocean.

You survive in a terrible plane crash and now you are out of civilization. Around the endless ocean, exhausting sun and hungry sharks. There is only one thing left for you - to survive at any cost.

To do this, you need to collect resources, improve the raft and build your shelter right on the raft. Remember that thirst and hunger are not the only dangers. Make sure the hungry shark doesn't destroy your raft!

12797,Meow???
12798,"""I am a 45 yo father, probably one of the oldest people playing this game. I am a single farther to my Son, who is 14 now. My son got this game for Christmas from his uncle, so we installed it on his computer and he started playing. By the end of the week he had 24 hours on this game. This was horrible for me, as it was already hard for me to find ways to spend time with my son, as he is always out with his friends or just, watching YouTube. So i decided to make a Steam account and get this game to see if I could maybe play alongside him. loaded into the game, made my character and world and started playing but I was stuck on what you where supposed to do. I asked my Son for help and he hosted a game for me to join. loved it as it was the best time had spent with my Son since my wife had died. This game has ever since brought me and my son closer again and now we actually spend time together outside the house together as well. This game reminded me that there's fun to be had in everything, and it has brought both me and my Son many happy memories.""


This guy is a phony! a big fat phony!"
12799,"I brought this game like an hour ago,and guess what,got stuck in connecting screen for one hour and cant even join server,any loading screen enjoyer would be recommended."
12800,Really fun if you can stick with a game.
12801,too much RNG for steady progression leading to very boring stretches playing whack-a-mole keeping the basic raft together
12802,"Other than the steam page soiling like... The whole game in its screenshots...
The game is alright.

It's a grind and after awhile you get real tired of the shark.
At some point it's just irritating to deal with when your ""raft"" is so large it's almost inconvenient to repair.

And by sharks, unless something has changed all they mean is ""beware of the infinitely respawning shark""

I will play the release/ update version, but it will likely be the last time."

I've played 6 hours at this point SOLO and I'm sick of sailing and dragging wood to my boat. The islands I've been on don't have a lot of wood. Then it's back to the open sea being pestered by a respawning shark that won't stay dead haha

I can't say I'd recommend this game but It would be better with a thumbs up than down IMO."

Depending on how you play the game. If you rush for the story and solo play, would require minimal grinding to self sustain and get materials for structures/equipments to progress to story location. If you focus more on surviving and building, grinding would need more time. And if you play with many friends, grinding is essential as the resources may be limited on every island and in the sea. Thus you would need to grind a lot resources in order to sustain a community.

Though it is not consider cheap as compared to some games, but the gameplay makes the money worth it.

One bug I have encountered in Co-op with friends is the raft doesn't move even when engines were sufficient and moving. Anchor was raised. Though problem was fixed after the host restart the game.

Overall a very decent game. -1 mark for more improvements. The story line is short but content in my opinion especially when co-op with a community of friends. Would be awesome if there are more story to it.

12865,Make sure you have a *lot* of spare time
12866,"Tried this 3 years ago and refunded after less than an hour. Saw it for sale on full release and purchased to give it another go.

This is STILL a terrible game. Grindy, glitchy, with NO onboarding for new players. I wish I hadn't tried to give it a second chance. I enjoy survival games, not ""you must drink every 18 minutes"" ""oh, you aren't <20 thirst? Guess you only need half the refreshment"" ""this game tries to force multiplayer"" ""why are you trying to read the menus, you should read a guide to learn how to play before you install"" bullshit that is this trashfire."
12867,"fun with friends
"
12868,"I have a lot of hours in this game and I think it's pretty fun. If you're looking for a challenging, survival type of game, this isn't it. This is a more relaxed, crafting and building with a little bit of exploring and some enemies that aren't very hard to deal with. I find this game more fun to play with another person or more people. The rats (lurkers) used to be faster and more aggressive which really surprised you and im disappointed that they made them a bit slower and took that edge away. The jump scare you got from them I thought was fun but now that is gone."
12869,This survival game so good!!!
12870,best game its amogus sussy
12871,kami riley g hidal ruined this gaming experience for me and now i am suicidal
12872,A bit of exploring and a bit of puzzle solving :D
12873,good game
12874,"Incredibly boring. Has quick early game progression, then there's a MASSIVE wall that halts progression. And that's when progression becomes based on luck. Presumably it gets better at some point, but going through the incredibly slow and boring mid-game is not worth it.

Also you can't pause it, Even when playing single player. That's dumb."
12875,"Overall a really fun survival game with many twists and turns to make for a good experience. Having followed this game for the last five years, I do think the finale and endgame were quite dissapointing. This makes  the game a good time, but not one I find myself reinstalling for a long time, if ever."

12877,One of the best co-op games for couples <3
12878,I do not like how this game portrays dark skinned people
12879,Really unique survival crafting game that breaks the formula enough to be interesting. Really fun co-op and since you're both sharing the same (initially) tiny raft its very collaborative.
12880,perfect

12882,yes

12885,"I got Raft on a whim and was literally instantly addicted to it, after finishing up the game pretty much I'm sitting at about 53 hours played. Really recommend this one as I've just played this in single-player, and playing with friends is surely equivalent if not even better in its hilarity."

12892,boring
12893,shark kept eating my ass. would play again
12894,"Great game, bought it and immediately spent all day on the game. Its a very grindy game in some parts. But that's why its fun. All my time was consumed until I didn't realize what time it was. I heavily suggest this game to many people."
12895,Great game
12896,"像我这种垃圾佬狂喜
可以在35%的程度上说这是漂流版MC，剩下的65%就是游戏画风还有其他的东西不一样了"
12897,Great multiplayer. One of my little boy's favorite games to play online with me. We've had some good times with this one.
12898," - Have you ever seen ""JAWS"" and thought to yourself: ""I bet it'd be pretty cool to be in that situation, except without guns and without a metal boat?""
 - Have you ever heard of the plight of plastic pollution in the ocean and sought an argument in which humanity could *only* survive if we polluted even harder?
 - Have you ever wanted a violent compulsion to commit genocide on birdkind?
 - Have you ever wanted to steal all the wood that your friends needed for fuel just so you could build a nice bookshelf nook on the second floor?
 - Have you ever decided to use even go want to look more like?

If you answered ""Yes"" to any of these questions: Congratulations! Raft is the game for you.

It's worth the price, sale or no. There's a bunch of content right now and it's cozy AF."

---{ Difficulty }---
☐ Just press 'W'
☐ Easy
☑ Easy to learn / Hard to master
☐ Significant brain usage
☐ Difficult
☐ Dark Souls
It was hard to choose between easy to learn/hard to master and actual brain usage just because the learning curve in the beginning is a bit steep. There's no tutorial or guidance so figuring out what you need to do in the beginning can be a bit intensive (and you will die... a lot...) unless you get into the community and ask questions/look for tips. Once I got into the community and figured out how the game worked it was like ""oh I'm dumb. How did I not notice this?"" cause its actually really simple but not necessarily intuitive. Oh, and build a spear and extra hook as soon as you can... like earlier than you think you'll need one. thank me later.

---{ Grind }---
☐ Nothing to grind
☐ Only if u care about leaderboards/ranks
☑ Isn't necessary to progress
☐ Average grind level
☐ Too much grind
☐ You'll need a second life for grinding
Ok, so there's literally NO grind to complete the story. If you just go story island to story island and make the minimum pit stops in between you can complete the whole story without a drop of real grind. However, if you want to take your time and build a really cool raft and really get into the crafting and building aspects of the game (which is my favorite part) then you will need to grind for resources. The minimum is there to survive and complete the story, but any extras you're gonna need to grind for. That said, the grind is actually pretty enjoyable. Gathering resources can actually be pretty relaxing so even though its grind, its enjoyable grind.

---{ Story }---
☐ No Story
☐ Some lore
☐ Average
☐ Good
☑ Lovely
☐ It'll replace your life
Great story and the story islands are super interesting and fun to explore. Being able to go back to story islands and they respawn resources so you get to explore again is also a nice little feature. Granted, the stuff is in the same place but what the stuff is changes.

---{ Game Time }---
☐ Long enough for a cup of coffee
☐ Short
☐ Average
☐ Long
☑ To infinity and beyond
If you just wanna rush through the story, speed runners do it in about 2-3 hours. But, if you like to just build and build and explore the time is limitless. I'm close to 500 hours and the bulk is on a single save. Even when the story is over, you can keep on playing as long as you want which is great. Then there's creative mode which lets you just build - no supplies or grind needed. If you like building, its really limitless.

---{ Price }---
☐ It's free!
☑ Worth the price
☐ If it's on sale
☐ If u have some spare money left
☐ Not recommended
☐ You could also just burn your money
Honestly, the dev's could charge more and I'd still say worth the price. Its early access but definitely doesn't feel like early access. 100% worth the price, no steam sale needed.

---{ Bugs }---
☐ Never heard of
☐ Minor bugs
☑ Can get annoying
☐ ARK: Survival Evolved
☐ The game itself is a big terrarium for bugs
Some bugs can be annoying (like on occasion you might get stuck on a charging hog - that's probably the most annoying) but there aren't any major major bugs and the dev team does a great job when a bug comes up at trying to fix it and address it. Then there are some bugs (like the floating floor trick) that started as bugs but now its become so widely used that people don't even want it fixed (for the most recent update people literally said please don't fix this bug). So yes, some annoying ones but they don't really take away from the game so don't let those couple of glitches scare you off!

Overall I give this game an 8/10 just because of the few glitches that can be annoying and because of the learning curve with no tutorial or instructions. The community has been great at stepping in and trying to guide new players though, so if you buy be sure and check out the community page and/or the raft discord if you have any trouble. Once you get the hang of it, the fun is pretty limitless between just working on a main save and creative mode and then even speed running if you're into that. There's also a very active mod community so you'll find a lot of stuff to do. Absolutely a worthwhile buy!!

12900,Lots of fun. Very addicting. Decent story. AND CO OP!
12901,I really like this game. I like the backstory and the crafting aspect as well. Relaxing music and the rolling waves is very zen. Try it you'll like it.
12902,raft
12903,fun
12904,UMMMMM ocean PLZZZZZZZZZZZZ
12905,I have spent way too much time on this boat and I don't regret it.
12906,holly smokes
12907,Love this game. I got it so my GF and I could play together. She is not a gamer but this game was easy for her to pick up and thrive in. We ended up playing for 12 hours straight on her day off and we both look forward to completing the story. She has been inspired by this genre of open world survival games and she has found a few to try after we beat this game. I recommend this game for parents to play with children and couples who might need a good impression into gaming.
12908,"very nice game. 
good graphics and game play."
12909,"I picked up Diamond, Candy and Cinnamon on an island because the open water can get a little lonely. They are nice to look at (just don’t let Ralph catch you staring) and provide for the boat in more ways than one. 

For example Ralph provides milk and the girls, which are llamas, you can sheer. That’s right, you can have animals live on your raft! What? You thought I was talking about strippers and their pimp? 

Get your minds out of the gutters and play some raft..."
12910,YES
12911,Awesome game! Really fun and addicting!
12912,YES!
12913,"its just so much fun to explore, gather, and create with your friends. The end game is def worth it!"
12914,"the sharks name is boaije. period.

also i banged ur mom (●'◡'●)"
12915,sucks
12916,nice game xD
12917,the game was fun but the new update made it so laggy that you basically cant do anything without telporting around or the game freezing
12918,pretty good
12919,raft
12920,What a very good game its a fun and entertaining game for everyone to play i recommend for people trying to find something that's fun and has fun things with updates that add cool stuff.
12921,good
12922,it is very fun to play with other friends and it's very fun to pass time and just grind
12923,"this is the best game i have ever played
"
12924,its really good and fun
12925,it goooood
12926,"game is acc pretty decent and ok to play when ur bored af thats why i cant give it a negative review however, that ending was wrote but a fucking 4 year old i mean come on man really just end the game like that so people will stop asking the devs to carry on the story big Ls"
12927,"very fun with friends< graphics are good, sound effects can be alittle much sometimes but all around a really good time and lots of fun to be had by all!"
12928,"Got stuck for a very frustrating couple of hours because the anchor was not explained very well and virtually invisible after deployment. I thought I had deployed the anchor when I really had set it down to be deployed and just gotten stuck on the island at just the right angle. I did not actually deploy the anchor until I was trying to leave, when I thought I was actually removing it to leave. You can imagine my frustration when I was about to delete the save and start over, when a friend offered to take a look. Shortly before he joined the game, I found the section of anchor hidden just out of view on the edge of my raft that I was supposed to detach.

Other than that annoyance, everything about the game has been fairly entertaining."
12929,"Great game, learnt the basics in early access, now starting again on the full release and can't wait to see what 
Brucie and friends have in store!  Much Fun!"
12930,"What makes it fun for ME is that its hard to collect resources and trying to survive in the game. I learned how to play this and have fun, even by myself so y'all should enjoy."
12931,"Best way to experience this game is by not looking up guides or 'best beginner raft' videos.
Playing alone is a bit of a grind but once you get past a certain point you can easily keep yourself fed and have enough resources. Multiplayer should be the only way you play. Having even just one friend to play with is very rewarding in the sense that you now have twice the amount of speed when gathering resources and upgrading your raft. Finding out how  the game works together is always more fun than doing it alone. So make sure to at least try the coop.
All in all it's a good survival game with an interesting plot. 
Sandbox mode can be fun too as you can test out builds and learn how to make certain shapes.
To me it's a 7/10 and i haven't even reached end game yet. Might come back to this when i finish it."
12932,goods
12933,Its pretty good you don't need a good pc
12934,"Much better than the early access now that it's in full release. wish I could turn off the wet vision effect, though, since it is downright fatal when playing at a lower framerate. Though the solution is probably a higher framerate :p 

Fantastic set of mechanics and very creative. Highly recommend playing with friends over playing alone."

12942,"It's really good, the story that came with the release, although interesting, seems a bit poor compared to how well the open ""world"" survival craft gameplaly is delivered"
12943,fuck bruce and especially fuck bane. other than those two fucking idiots id say the game is pretty fantasticsea and fun for the whole shiver!
12944,this game is really fun!!!! :D
12945,"Just a quick downvote to so-called ""released"" game. Deverlopers decide it's a time to remove ""Early Access"", I decide to try this game and..

- No tutorials, you are just dropped in the middle of the ocean on a 4 block raft floating through some debris to a first isle accompanied by a shark... even Minecraft had kind of tutorial/quest to easy your start... this game offers absolutely nothing to beginners like me.. I need to again google and google.

- No tooltips. No settings are explained. No crafting stations are explained. No way to unbind a key. I don't know how purifier works, I can't figure out what to do with recipes (and I build research thingie)... Sure it's all my fault, because I am a stupid person who play the game without watching few hours of lets play videos (sarcasm).

- Bugs. A LOT OF BUGS. Starting from credits window which upon opening is scrolled into a middle and finishing the raft floating through the isle, The game may pause when opening menu or may not (I couldn't figure out how pause is supposed to work). The game can't even remember setting ""no friends can join"" when loading world. It freezes few times when playing with settings as well..

- Poor optimization. I set everything on minimum, but fps is just floating so terribly high when simply rotating camera around: 60 (vsync) and then drops to 40.. Why??? GPU is at 100% no matter of settings, what this game is doing???

- The survival aspects are just terrible. I tried easy and still game is too fast paced for my taste. The hunger/thirst meters are going way to fast down. The whopping 25 slot inventory become full way too quick and despite I ignored certain loot it was full pretty quick. The basic required staff will occupy roughly 1/3 of available space. And I didn't even had resources to craft very first storage...

- The enemies.. The always following you shark, which I can't kill and as I read it will anyway respawn.. Shark make exploration aspect of the game very poor on higher difficulty. On easy I just ignore it completely (lets talk about balance?).

- The raft will gets slowly eaten.. Every 10 or so minute one piece will gone. So you need that much to compensate by building it. And to build you need plastic. Good luck with stopping gathering precious plastic for a minute or so...

Sure the game was in early access for 5 years and maybe it's too long. If it was released in a current state without early access I wouldn't complain. I'd give developers a time and chance to fix it (you know the ""No Man's Sky story""?). But if game suddenly become 1.0 while polishing and QoL-ing is far far until the end, then the reason is very simple - money. The studio running out of money and they already (more likely long time ago) started working on another title. Means this game will not get fixed and will stay a shame for a studio as ""Medieval Enginieers"", as ""Planet's Explorers"", as many others EA games.

... We should stop buying EA games. Too much scams and disappointing. Too much excuses ""oh looks, the game is EA, why blaming it, just wait"". And then ""7 years to die"" titles around with outdated engines or devs, who just gave up and want to move on..."
12946,"If a survival-crafting game isn't something special and/or unique, I won't touch it. Titles such as Subnautica, Valheim, and V Rising have easily won me over with their unique takes on a genre that is normally saturated with objectives that are repetitive and mundane. With that being said, I can now add another game to my list: Raft. Want a digested version of what you can expect from Raft? Take Waterworld starring Kevin Costner (awesome movie btw), take out a majority of the gritty violence, throw in some cute graphics, and toss the island exploration of Wind Waker into the mix. That, in a nutshell, sums up what you can expect from Raft. This is a game that's all about discovery, and while you can most certainty enjoy the adventure solo, it's hard to truly enjoy what Raft has to offer unless you're with a group."
12947,VEry nice. A lot of water. so much water. amazing 10/10
12948,"This is an overall good, semi peaceful co-op game. My husband and I have played this for a few years now, and overall I really haven't had tweak recommendations or anything. It's pretty good as it is, and this new update made it 10x better."

12958,friggen rock and roll game get all stoned up with some buds and friggen get that raft ah goin!
12959,very good game
12960,"Absolute garbage game. One of the worst I've ever played. You'd have to be some form of an animal to enjoy the shark that attacks you 100ms after falling into the water and swims up on the shore and through islands to attack the player.

The developers must suffer from brain damage to think the game play in Raft is anything but total dog shit."
12961,Great game

12969,"One of my favorite games to play with friends. We can always hop on, start a new game, and play for hours. Screw the shark tho"
12970,buy it bajeet
12971,"This is great, I get to be homeless AND die to a shark every second! !"
12972,This game is incredibly fun with a group and as you continue on it just gets even more fun as people start doing their own things. Honestly can't say the same about solo because that's not for the faint of heart but hey give that a shot if you want. If you're looking for a relaxing time I recommend at least 3 people with one who keeps people on track otherwise you're likely going to die...a lot
12973,"Pretty addictive. You can get lost for hours out there collecting, building, and crafting new things."
12974,sucks
12975,"Raft is a great, late night kind of game.  You've had a hard day and just want to chill with some friends so you hop on Raft and quickly progress through the plentiful amounts of content.  There is quite a bit of customization and the ""survival"" aspects are just there for more depth.  You don't really have to think too much about food or water unless you want to up the difficulty."
12976,Could be amazing if they made a challenge mode
12977,good game fun with friends not so fun alone
12978,"Very fun exploration/base building game. SUPER fun with friends, the more the merrier.

Also f**k seagulls >:("

12991,"to get the best experience out of this game you should play with your friends. really cute game i enjoyed it alot. 

some stuff in this game does not make any sence ( like any other game ) but its forgivble. 

i would totaly recommend playing it if you are looking for an adventure, team game play and builder."
12992,"good
"
12993,"100% yes, best survival game i've ever played, and on top of that, best indie game i've ever played
The wait for the final chapter was worth it, amazing puzzles, great ambiance, soundtrack same as always but also perfect
the story was not that complex or deep, but it doesn't matter, all the details in the world are well done and the endgame is so gratifying
i especially love things that make me cry with emotion, and this game was one of those things
recommend playing with a friend, playing alone might be a little boring depending on your will to play long exploration games"

13008,"Very enjoyable game, can be relaxing at times.

Note: When first starting out, the game can prove to be somewhat difficult, so I HIGHLY recommend looking up a guide to help. I honestly regret not looking up a guide within my first few hours of playing.

Good game, whatsoever!"

13017,shark shark
13018,"I would definitely recommend this game for the multiplayer element. But after 16 hours I'm not sure if it plays like I would expect a released game to play. The animations/graphics are quite poor, some mechanics are still buggy and janky and the hunger/thirst rates are ridiculously high for 'normal' difficulty. It would make sense to have slow degradation rates, but the need for far better food to stay fuller for longer. The shark is a funny mechanic and makes for a lot of laughs on multiplayer, but it's screwed how overpowered it is. Constant attacks when you're swimming, and attacks on the boat, mean you're constantly having to drop what you're doing just to get it away. Killing it doesn't have a long enough respawn gap either.

So overall, it's fun and there's a lot to do, but it seems to be much better played in a group than alone. I hope the devs keep working on it to get it to a level Subnautica is at, where everything is really nice and polished."
13019,"pretty good game good atmosphere however only bad thing is that it aint to good without friends it seems bland without other people other wise pretty good
"
13020,"É bem ruim, ter q ficar cuidando de 50 coisas, e ao mesmo tempo explorar complexos gigantes(principalmente os dos final do jogo) é uma experiencia bem desagradavel 

Tem muitas mecânicas, tipo cuidar das plantas, explorar, não morrer de fome, não morrer de sede, cuidar do combustivél, e tudo isso ao MESMO TEMPO. Eu pessoalmente achei uma experiencia  bem miserável"
13021,Yeas
13022,"Very chill, relaxing building/survival game. Building up a ship from a single square is satisfying. The exploration of the ""dungeons"" is interesting, as each one plays like a kind of puzzle. And honestly, just drifting along, building my raft is very calming.

Only major problem is combat. It's completely awful. Most of the time, enemies are more annoying to fight than fun, and weapon attacks are so stiff and slow. It's not that I wish they didn't add it, but I wish it had a bit more time. Thankfully, it's a fairly small amount of the game."
13023,"Raft is a very fun game to play with idiotic friends.
You can either be productive or just float around, collecting some loot and building stuff."
13024,kumalala
13025,best 24 hrs of my life
13026,Good Game
13027,"I think it's absolutely epic as a survival game. I definitely recommend. It's slightly hard to play when you're by yourself, but it is manageable. It's how I've been playing and I'm having a blast! I'm still learning a lot but it's so much fun. I do wish that when the dolphins were around that the shark would temporarily skedaddle though. I'm almost positive that dolphins beat up sharks on occasion in real life."
13028,such a sussy little game
13029,great game ending sucks
13030,Great game to play with friends and such a fun take on survival games! Discovering islands and exploring them is one of my favorite experiences.
13031,aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa
13032,"Quite fun to build up the raft, and play with different designs, and most of the progress is strait forward. However, following the story is the only way to unlock most of the blueprints, and difficulty level doesn't effect the time between attacks unless it's set to peaceful.

There is a lot to do at the start if you go single player, but becomes quite manageable one you have some basics set up."
13033,"Raft: 
Incredible update after incredible update. 
Been playing this game for a little over 4 year and every time there is a new update me and my friends would hop on, fresh world and redo everything again + all the new story timelines. Completed the game as a whole now and such a great story! Shame there may not be any more huge updates to look forward to, but hopefully will be nice to see some smaller things added in the future. Massive thumbs up, would recommend to anyone. 11/10! 
"
13034,Just finished the game with a buddy of mine. Loved it. Definitely worth playing. Although it sucks that its the last chapter and you get all these cool items and you know the game is over. Makes playing it after kinda pointless. GG Worth the money alone for the story and adventure.
13035,Just buy it. You wont regret it.
13036,ni

13038,"Pros:
Fun and satisfying base building
Good music
Relaxing once you don't have to freak out about the shark
Fishing is easy and automatic
Slick UI that's not hard on the eyes
You can fall what looks like 40 feet without breaking your legs or taking any damage
Cons:
Wind current is SO strong that even a comical amount of engines or sails will be overpowered by the current in most situations
Water and food drain too quickly
Not for people who dislike grinding in games
Enemies are a little clunky"

13040,"Me and the shark have beef... so I killed it and showed it to its brother that showed up 5 minutes later and now I have beef with the whole shark population 
10/10 would go to war with sharks again"
13041,perfect
13042,gitu deh
13043,FUNNN
13044,"Game is very weird, even on normal difficulty your character needs to eat every 2 seconds even after eating a whole coconut/watermelon. The game has a shark which will just eat your boat even if you are not even on it just cause. 

If you want a good survival game I would highly recommend the forest instead."
13045,"this game, though its bugs and abysmal update schedule, is just so relaxing and fun and just a great way to pass time. With the freedom to build anything on your raft there is something for everyone from the story driven to the creative type."
13046,i suck with mouse and key brode but the controlls are great
13047,"Love the game, specially playing with friends."
13048,Give it native controller support... for the love of God!
13049,This games is just fun
13050,"This game is broken trash, should never have left beta. Your guy is starving every 2 minutes unless you play on easy mode, it feel clunky and stiff, and the sharks is a T-1000. Sometimes you just cannot throw your hook unless you die. My friend had to kill himself to solve some issues. 

Better off playing Ark or Conan or the forest or any other survival game with a raft. 

Gameplay 4/10
Visuals 5/10 
Sound 7/10

13054,"What a great game. With the Final Chapter! update we now have an end. A rather good one at that. Most of the story is resolved (the big stuff at least) with a few little things to leave east room for DLC. Having played since the game first came to steam it never gets old playing this game. Build your raft and make it home.  Fight Bruce that raft eating jerk. Game does have mod support as well. there are some really good ones to. If you like survival games (this one is rather chill for a survival) or like building a cool base, then you will love this game."
13055,Very fun survival game
13056,it is fun but i cant kill the shark
13057,"This game is awsome because:
1. Is multyplayer so you can play it with your friends
2. The story is very intresting
3. The gameplay is nice
I recommend this game for every player searching for adventure and a cool story"
13058,"I loved this game. Really did. It was fun especially with friends and could be pretty easy going. A nice game to relax and just have fun while surviving. However, 1.0 has completely made this game unplayable. Being forced to be online is annoying but I can deal with it. What makes this unplayable is the game turning computers into furnaces. I have an RTX2070, i7-9700k, 48gb ram, 750w corsair power supply with 3 strong fans, multiple vents for air, and liquid cooling. This game, for whatever reason since this update, overheated my PC and forced it to shut down. My friends also complained of the game melting their PCs as well and we didn't even play for very long. I cannot recommend this game until this is fixed. Never had an issue before. Beat chapter 2 previously with no problems but 1.0 has done something wrong. Lowering settings also didn't fix this issue, PC continued to overheat. Not even Elden Ring heated up my PC as much as this little game did."
13059,"So, is this ""finished game"" in the room with us?"
13060,"Difficult and frustrating for all of the wrong reasons. It's a constant grind just to break even with the extreme attrition you are up against. Tools wear out quickly, you get hungry and thirsty quickly, and the whole thing is designed to be played co-op. It's weird and buggy, and the premise is bizarre. Every hostile animal has it out for you, and only you, and your raft. You are at war with every living creature on Earth, and they are allied against you. There is no chance that you are not being attacked. You don't have a moment of respite. Birds are eating your food, sharks are attacking your raft, and will come for you if you get in the water. Land animals want to kill you. And your tools and weapons wear out after just a few uses. The balance is just awful. If you die, you lose 2/3 of your shit and respawn with very little health. If you die again you are just robbed blind. If you lose the last piece of your raft, you are screwed. You can't start another one, but it doesn't end the game, but the game is basically over. It just lets you figure out on your own that you're screwed. Nothing is really documented. There's no introduction or guidance to get you started.

I tried really hard to like this game, but it's just shitty. It's shitty and exhausting. I'm tired of reeling in little wooden planks with a plastic or metal hook that only works a few times.

They even disabled offline play for a while when it was released, then they decided that they would magnanimously allow people who purchased the game to play it offline if they want, after thinking about it for a while. I can tell right away that I don't like the people who made this game, so I basically don't have any hope that they're going to turn this into anything I'm going to like."

13087,"0,01hr refund"
13088,"Doesn't explain how to do anything.  If you like figuring out things for yourself, it looks like there's a lot to enjoy.  There isn't even a hint of a tutorial aside from your journal telling you don't get eaten by sharks."
13089,"Looking for a realistic survival game with free sandbox gameplay? - Then this game is probably NOT for you.
But it can still be a fun and interesting game, especially with friends.
EDIT: Never mind, this game design sucks. Normal/Easy mode is too simple but in Hard mode it's game over if you're playing solo. I'm fine with losing my inventory and such but blocking off all save states and no chance to revive at all if solo? Just why? Unfortunately, it took me too long to die in Hard mode so I can't get a steam refund. This is not about difficulty (Hard mode is not that difficult - but one of the glitches might get you eventually, like being killed by a bird under water), it's about lacking options and being locked out of your game in solo.

My old review:

Let me start with the bad stuff: The world design and resources very unrealistic. The same goes for the gameplay (you can't create a second raft, you are bound to your raft, you can't build on islands and if you lose your raft it's game over). There are questionable design decision (the waves on the beach will have the shark fly around or resources becoming unable to be collected - this seems weak for a v1.0 game). Especially in the early game your raft can get stuck on islands which is frustrating. The islands are (as far as I have seen) not generated randomly and become repetitive. They spawn/despawn periodically in your way.

The good stuff: It's fun if seen as a resource-collection and (raft) building game, especially with friends. The exploration is fun if you're ok with staying on the track the game wants you to go."
13090,nice
13091,endless creativity and time killer
13092,"Extremely slow game. It's imbalanced and tedious to play. Might be oka to play with others, but a waste of time to play solo."
13093,"Main quest areas are too huge and it sucks having to hold W for such a long time. It's even worse when you don't go to the intended area first, so you eventually have to retrace your steps making it take even longer. That's too tedious for me.

[spoiler] I missed the first door on vasagatan and spent a lot of time back and forth until I found it, completed it quickly after though.
Balboa Island is too huge, I don't have enough materials for the amount of weapons I need because of the bears. Ended up dying and can't be bothered to continue. [/spoiler]
"
13094,Good
13095,"Look, I haven't even got into the plot and I have spent days of my actual life on this game. I love it. I love chilling out and floating around and building my raft up. I'm looking forward to where the plot will take me when I actually get around to it.

If you want a chill survival crafting game then this'll do you well. There's a shark to poke off the raft and you'll probably end up running away from a lot of boars, but I appreciate that when I get bored of floating I can explore an island, and when I get bored of islands I can go back to floating.

I haven't tried the multiplayer yet but that's because I don't trust my husband (he has a knack in games like this for getting me killed and losing my stuff, lol). It seems like it would be pretty fun with friends."
13096,"Pros: I love the options for customizing my raft and there is plenty to see and do. This game can really scratch that survival/exploration itch! Overall I enjoyed most of the experience and don't regret my time with the game.

Cons: Inventory management is a serious chore. The last third of the game seems to lose sight of what Raft does best. The focus shifts to more combat (boss battles) and jumping, neither of which I cared for. The last location in particular has some extremely tedious fights and jumping sections that have made me bounce off the game a couple times already."

As of right now, there are still performance issues the larger you build the raft, and movement is a little janky at time. Other than that, with the new items and storyline added in Chapter 3, the Raft experience is one I would recommend."
13155,"It's finally finished and it's great, definitely one of my favorite survival games out there where you can easily lose track of time and cruise around the open sea that the game offers you.
Great gameplay, pretty good story and cool ending. Worth picking up now that the game has been officially launched. I look forward to seeing what Redbeet Interactive make next!"

13165,"This Game is all about torturing Animals. (*)

First you Start by impaling a Shark.
Followed by shooting Seaguls and 'Screecher'-birds with Bow and Arrow.
Killing Puffer- and Anglerfish while diving, tackle Warthogs, Ice- or Honeybears, Rats and Pigs while you are going on Land.
You have to capture local Wildlife like Turkeys, Llamas and Goats to cage them up and get some Artisan goods.
You capture Bees and put them into Glassjars -Forcing them later to produce Honey on your Raft.-
Also you can affect local underwater wildlife with Lights to scare off Jellyfish from there resting places.
You can track down a big 'Mamabear' who is sitting peacefully in front of her Cave.

You display slain Prey by beheading the Bodys, hang them on Trophyboards or wear the stuffed Versions as a Headpiece.
You display a full Body of a huge Hammershark on a Device to present your dominance in this World.

For your own survival you have to eat Oceanfish after grilling it or put them into Soup.
You can get Fame with the Trading Company when you Fish for rare Species and Sell them for some Tokens.
Even a lot Achievements are based on killing most of the Animals.

[u] But the most important thing to notice: [/u]
You have to defend yourself by killing the many trained Hyenas of a Guy who constantly threatens the Local Townspeople.
He only get 'imprisoned' after you defeated him, without giving him a scratch!
(The Cage he gets imprisoned is not even locked, so he will escape easily.)

Conclusion:
To progress in this Game you have to kill, scare away or lock up hundreds of animals and do absolutely 'NO' Harm to Humans.

- 10/10 Best Game.

13178,"One of these games, that after all these years in EA you get the feel of ""Well, seems like they just wanted to finish it finally without making it good"". 
Weird mechanics, bad hit boxes, input delay of doom. And on top of it they converted it in some kind of bad plattform jump and run game. 
Not sure whats up with the voice acting either, sometimes it sounds like people with bad accent reading a weird script without emotions, sometimes it just sounds like a crazy AI talking, the Humor feels shallow and forced but that may be a personal taste. The Story is somewhat okayish, but nothing special. 
They should have focused on the scavanging and survival part, and (a common point of survival games) why the heck the protagonist has to eat like 5 whole sharks a day?! The food consumption is crazy. I can somewhat understand the water need, but food...even on easy mode, it's just weird.... (yes i know, well prepared food lasts longer)
It might be easier with a group, but alone you spend a lot of time just micro managing everything.
And last but not least, as a personal matter, a point that really annoys me...
Who the heck had the idea of making that stupid windmill jump and run in Utopia... yeah, I'm honest, I'm very bad at jump and run games, but i tried this windmill stuff in 1st person and got pushed off so many times... so i switched to 3rd person, and...they push you of even if they don't hit you, they just have some kind of crazy hit box that pushes you without even touching you.

Conclusion:
If you are looking for a ""post apocalyptic"" waterworld like game, with focus on scavanging and survival, and some nice raft building, well... don't buy it. 
If you are looking for some Super Mario Plattformer and want to have fun with friends, some easy survival mechanics (easy if you have fun at micro management) and a lot of ocean cleaning, well, this one is the right game for you!"

My only bug-bear is there needs to be some balancing of the food/water bar as it would be nice to be able to explore story islands without having to pack what feels like a inventory full of food and water, even the higher level meals and drinks still don't really cut being able to fully enjoy island exploration. 

Still despite that very fun, very creative and easily a game you'll hear yourself say 'Just one more island before I go'"
13192,super good best 24.9 hours of my life
13193,"I love this type of game, and I really enjoyed its predecessor from Axolot, Scrap Mechanic, so I had high hopes for Raft. But I have to say that I'm feeling somewhat disappointed here.

The whole experience feels underdeveloped and one-dimensional. The main threat in the ocean besides food and drink is a murderously aggressive shark — really? That gets old real fast. Okay, there are a few other deadly fish in the water, but c'mon guys, be a little more creative maybe... the ocean is full of terrors, not just monstrous sealife.

I also think the sailing and boat mechanics could be so much more interesting, considering this is a boat-based survival game. The physics of wind and water are pretty primitive; for example, apparently there's no center of mass or drag here, you just point your sail in a direction and the entire raft moves along that vector, no matter where on the boat the sail resides.

I was also stunned by the fact that you only have the ONE raft and can't build another one. Oh, you hopped onto an island to collect some pineapples and your raft floated away into the great blue? Too fucking bad, this run is over, time to commit suicide so you can respawn on the raft. Is it just me or is that a bit ridiculous? You're telling me this wayfaring carpenter can build a sail and a clock from scrap wood and hairpins, but placing the foundation of a new raft is IMPOSSIBLE?

It's all a bit more fun with other people in multiplayer, but overall this game gets a big MEH rating from me."
13194,
13195,"I like this game because it has a sense of suspense when the shark isn't there, the survival mechanics, but what I don't like that the fact that all of the worlds I have made, I get stuck on an island and I can't get any materials. The materials would stop in place as soon as I hit an island. I get stranded on a small island every time I make a world. This game is really good and I like it but the getting stranded on small islands is annoying."
13196,Good game pretty fun and grindy!
13197,Cel mia forta joc survival!
13198,"WTH did I just play.... Repetitive boss fights, empty islands, and porn acting from all characters. Mediocre / 10"
13199,louie played it with me
13200,bad
13201,Shark pussy got me acting unwise 😏
13202,w
13203,yes
13204,that's it?
13205,wood water then more wood and more water
13206,"shark scary , not safe for me"
13207,"As someone who never really played the game in its early stages , i can say for now with my at this point 69 *cough* hours of playtime with some friends that the game is pretty nice , its a bit tough to feed a bigger group of people but otherwise the game is pretty fun when it comes to building and the story ! i can recommend the game if your looking for a survival game with some friends :) The story islands are fun to explore , both the character items and building items are well looking :) ! go and get it !"
13208,"It's a good game. Having played through it again since playing it in early access they've added a fair bit. The floating base idea is great and you can visually see your progression. I will warn though that this is the grindiest survival game I know of. You must do a lot of swimming because you need about 8000 calories a day and those calories take forever to catch and cook. The shark is a constant annoyance and basically serves to just keep you on the raft and slow down progress. I also don't get enjoyment out of the constant decay of equipment or the sky high recipe costs. 

So overall it's enjoyable but it's VERY grindy and could be a great game if they balanced some things or gave players sliders to decide how much time they want to waste but these complaints have been around since early access so I wouldn't count on it.

edit: I'm changing this to a thumbs down after getting past where I ended in early access. The constant food grind is still terrible. I'm encountering regular gameplay bugs. Want animals? Better have them on the second story or they just disappear. Want to setup the radar? Hope you have a couple extra chests of wood to guess and check the requirements for placement in relationship to the radar. Want your engine to work? Hope you have less than 100 tiles and it doesn't bug out and stop accepting planks. Manage to kill a goat? The body just disappears before your eyes like you imagined the whole thing just like the one npc I've met so far. 

They decided to lean into combat and parkour which were probably the worst parts of the game previously. You used to be excited to go to islands and now they have birds constantly dropping stones on your head and a warthog who tries to kill you constantly like the shark. I killed the same rat with the jump attack run at you loop over 15 times at one of the story locations while going through one of the most boring linear collection quests I can remember in recent time. The game is just a mess, unfun, and should still be early access. The further I get into it the less fun it becomes with the only somewhat redeaming quality being the raft base building."
13209,"Amazing game, incredible fun with friends.
I'd love to see steam workshop for mods in the future for sure."
13210,YES. RAFT is Reatardedly Fun
13211,excellent danny devito simulator
13212,Endless hours of fun
13213,"Это игра просто прекрасна со стороны строителя, но моменты нудного сбора порой раздражают, но по большей части, пока ты фармишь (именно на этапе титана и электроприборов) находишь различные декорации или те самые маски (В самой игре узнаете). Сюжет в игре, конечно, не самый мощный, но как вариант интересной истории сойдет. Строительство в игре не самое богатое, но в нем есть главная изюминка а именно декор благодаря нему ваша коробка превратиться в прекрасный и уютный дом, в котором будет очень приятно просто плыть по течению, отвлекаясь только попить водички или пожарить очередную часть акулы 
--(English Google Translate)---
This game is simply beautiful from the side of the builder, but the moments of tedious gathering are sometimes annoying, but for the most part, while you are farming (precisely at the stage of titanium and electrical appliances), you find various decorations or those same masks (you will find out in the game itself). The plot in the game, of course, is not the most powerful, but as a variant of an interesting story it will do. The construction in the game is not the richest, but it has the main highlight, namely the decor, thanks to it your box will turn into a beautiful and comfortable home, in which it will be very pleasant to just go with the flow, being distracted only by drinking some water or frying another part of the shark"
13214,Nice Long time
13215,"Solo on hard is alot of fun. Every want to play out your fantasy from the movie WaterWorld, then this is the game for you.
So happy they have voice lines for the notes, great touch."
13216,good game
13217,"The first game was a multiplayer and the four hours we played flew by, this game can be played endlessly if you want or follow the story line and complete the goals if that's what you want instead."
13218,Fun game
13219,"A few Friends and I bought the Game together and have bee on it for two whole nights, its fair to say we love the experience"
13220,Raft provides an enjoyable game concept I have not seen in any game before.

13222,Great game to play with the significant other.
13223,the gameplay is amazing and the story so far is amazing as well great game so far!
13224,YES
13225,i recommend this game for 10-12 year old kids that like survival an to explore
13226,"Don't forget to include a good friend and just get lost in the peaceful, yet devastating Deep blue ocean. A very chill and relaxing game. Played 5 straight hours non stop and it soothed my soul. FYI make a spear as fast as possible and be prepared to defend your ocean trash raft!!! *CRUNCH!*    P.S. Thank God world pollution hasn't stopped!"
13227,i hate olof's big hyena so 2/10 for the game
13228,It really is a incredible game to play. Maybe a little pricy but lotssssss of fun.
13229,One of the best games and really good story line
13230,"Fun games to play with friends, i like it."
13231,This game is fun as fuck. me and the lads like to play it while getting sloshed which makes the game incredibly funny. Day 1 went as follows: Spawn on 2x2 raft see shark get a shit ton of wood and plastic make raft large experience true fear when shark murders friend. save friend from the depths of the sea. make bed sleep. a few hours into the next morning we starved to death. 96/100 only thing i didnt like was when we got animals during rough seas they clipped out of the pen and were never to be seen again :( rip BradyJr the Baadest mf to ever goat

13253,"This game scratches every itch. Platforming, puzzles, sandbox building, exploration, open ocean/deep ocean fears, boss fights. 10/10 game and hopefully they add dlcs later."
13254,good game but the ending is disappointing and boring ugh
13255,very fun 10/10 would recommend
13256,i have played this game with a group of 4 from its conception. the game has come so far and it is such a good time with a group of people
13257,"Nice little game. Once you get to the story quest, it gets very fun. A bit repetitive but easy to progress."
13258,"Got hooked by the premise and the hint of a story in the in-game notebook. But the game falls flat in the first hour. There's no tutorial, which is part of the enigmatic appeal of some survival games, but given how easy it is to softlock yourself the game desperately needs one. Resources only spawn in a radius around your raft, meaning if you lose the thing you have no way to collect items and progress. You can't build a new raft either, only extend an existing one, so if the shark gobbles your raft up you are once again out of luck. I wouldn't half-mind these choices if they were communicated in-game through a tutorial or additional end-states. But they're not, and so they come across as bugs more than they do features."
13259,Very relaxing music and very zen building/resource collection. Added story mode adds a very fun element to it.
13260,A fresh and enjoyable take on the survival/crafting genre.
13261,i stabbed my friend
13262,Very fun. A great take on the survival game genera.
13263,Wish I could forget everything and experience it again
13264,"I've given this game about 3 playthroughs now, and I can't recommend it enough. I tend to hop from one game to another very quickly, but I could easily chill and spend a couple of hours playing this game. The building is simple but lets you build some really neat looking bases, Brutus is annoying but serves his purpose as a constant danger. The story content is simple but at the same time will push you to think a ~little,~ but just enough to where you're never stumped. Most of the time.

I played majorly with friends, so I can't attest to the single player experience. But if you and your buddies are looking for a good new co-op game, I promise this will be a fun play."
13265,
13266,Very addicting
13267,"At almost 100hrs in Raft I've been following the game pretty much since release, the team have blown themselves out of the water (heh) with this update, so much new content and so much more fun. With a simple and easy to grasp gameplay loop it's kept me entertained for HOURS! I would 100% recommend this to anybody who wants a relaxing survival experience both alone or with friends!"
13268,"game is very fun, i dont think about my decisions when sacrificing my friends for the shark. 
"
13269,shark  no raft  no inventory   island   so bored
13270,Great game to play when you want to turn your brain off and focus on something other than the real world. Easy learning curve with a great crafting system to go with it.
13271,"Fun game, just wish there was not only more to do but more types of marine life too see."
13272,"I honestly expected this game to be just another ocean survival game, however it now one of my favorite games of all time and I would highly recommend it to all my friends."
13273,My friend was getting clay when a fish blew him up. A terrorist fish. 10/10

13275,"I just started playing this game with a group of my friends and I absolutely adore it so far. It reminds me of the tranquility of Stardew Valley mixed with the need for survival like in Rust (but not as aggressive, obviously).

13295,Bruce is a bastard but the sea galls are worse. 10/10 would recommend.
13296,good game
13297,"I would fully Recommend this game; I started this game during the very early days, when there was just you, a raft and an invincible shark, surviving on an empty sea. 

This game has come a long way since then and it has been a joy to experience and just chill out to really, for me it brings me a melancholy feeling of just drifting alone and fighting for survival in a vast unending ocean, wondering what I will come across along the way and if I'll ever see another soul. That's one of the core components I've loved about this game, of course, the story and the further puzzles and exploration that come later on add to it immensely.

Thank you so much to the Developers you have done incredible work with this game!"

Overall 9/10 it doesn't get much better from here when it comes to games like these. :)"

13328,You cannot use items while sitting in a chair. Fishing takes no skill and you just press a button and it ends up in your inventory (no reeling or fighting the fish).
13329,"good story nice
"
13330,Good game but chapter 3 had no effort put into it with a garbage ending. How are you going to give all these useful blueprints at the end of the game when they could've been so useful earlier.
13331,"Honestly, the vast scale of the game and the different ways to see new locations and possibilities to upgrade your raft, is a vast experience you need to see. This game is amazing to play with a friend/friends, its one of the co-op games you want to experience. Highly recommend, super fun."
13332,its really fun kinda like the forest
13333,"Great game, even better with QoL mods. Technological progression beyond a certain point is tied to visiting islands and story points of interest. Shark is incredibly annoying initially but becomes a non-factor once you have enough fishing and foundations. Incredible evolution from a project that started so long ago and without a doubt, an early access success story."
13334,Sehr Toll!

The storyline is extremely interesting and different from other games. Every update gets better and better! Now that I have completed it, I'm even more happy that it continues to let you play the same world after finishing all the missions. The puzzles are challenging, yet fun to do. 100% reccomend if you like survival games with a great storyline!!!"
13346,a lot of fun to play. Have nit played with any friends yet but i would be even more fun
13347,good
13348,MARRY ME ALPHAQWERTY!!!!
13349,Playing co-op with a group of friends is a great time. A game you could play with your feet up. Progressing and personalising your raft is very satisfying.
13350,"good
"
13351,"Easy to learn Survival game, that at times seems chaotic, and at other times seem like not much is happening. Which I kind of like. It's different from other survival games because you're basically stuck on a raft and you got to scavenge from it in order to expand and survive. It's not just easy to explore bigger islands in the beginning which I like, because it gives you a goal to work toward. 

It's a more slow burn Survival game, and while simple, it's entertaining and a different take on the normal survival games where you can just go out and explore quickly. I do like it, but not sure if I would need more content and stuff in the long run. (But then again I haven't really started the game properly yet, I'm still just surviving, and haven't been able to explore so much. So maybe there's more to look forward to!)

But so far, I think it's good."

13368,Great time for friends. I've been waiting for full release and now that its here i highly recommend giving it a play. The creators added in some voice acting for a lot of the notes and really bumped up the quality of the story with the addition. A lot of quality of life additions as well. I give it a 9/10.
13369,"i wanted this game for a long time since early beta, 10/10 recommend to anyone who loves to chill"
13370,so basically theres this shark i call it karen but theres another name witch u can find out urself and theres actually a story to the game but im pretty sure like half the people who play the game have no idea about the story so yeah definitely buy this game its insane
13371,"really good, top quality barrel hooking"

13384,"Okay, so a bit of background: i haven't played the story part at all. But i have played the main game, and in my opinion it is very good.  The game is in a cool and interesting place, and has levels of fear of losing you stuff if you get eaten, or starve to death.  Sometimes it does get frustrating and you wanna rage quit (I've done that because of getting stuck on Islands), but over all it's a very good game.  Sometimes there are times where I get bored of the constant searching for supplies, but that's when you get your friend in a world with you and it makes it 10 times better! That's the best part of it I think.   Over all a cool game. very interesting.  worth the money for what you get. :D"
13385,Fun co op game.
13386,"I really wanted to play this game, but I can't do FPS.  The 3rd person option did not seem very fluid.  Also, lack of controller support made it very hard to play.  If you are a K&M player who does not get motion sickness from FPS, this looks to be a really fun game!"

I bought this game thinking it was going to be expansive but it ended up just ending after 30 hrs of play time. the ending was dogshit and felt super underwhelming. like ""hey, you beat the game, now go farm titanium for hours and stop at several different islands or pay a ridiculously overpriced 3 trash cubes for some"". This game was fun but now there's no point to it, also why tf do vending machines only sell cosmetics. The game is fun but not worth the price tag. also dev team if you're reading this hire a bigger team and make better updates ik y'all have the fucking money to because judging by this update y'all didn't put a whole lot of money into it anyway."

Playing this with one of my best friends has been my favorite gaming experience of the year, HANDS DOWN. I recommend this to anyone who enjoys the survival game genre!"
13414,"The game is great as something to play with or without friends, its great. 
if your the type of person that loves Survival games, thisll be great for you.
no real bug issues, and even if there are the game constantly gets updated, might slow down to just bug fixes for a while with the final chapter being released, but youll enjoy it anyways.

great and easy to join multiplayer, (friends have to have a copy of the game to play) and the only limiting thing in multiplayer is internet connection, but thats a pretty normal issue to have. ive  played multiple games alone and with friends, and I still keep coming back.

100% recommend, get it for you and a friend."

13426,Great Game
13427,yes but you need a very good pc to get a good experience
13428,"its a lot of fun to play with friends i really enjoy it
"
13429,"It's finally finished and it's great, one of my favorite survival games. I wish there was more to do post game. Something like, you unlock a map item and the world stops being procedurally generated, so you can go around and officially map it. That'd give a reason to keep playing for a while after the story is finished. It'd also be neat if this mechanic let you pick an island to build a permanent home on, too. Alas, I doubt this fantasy will come to pass. Still, when my only complaint is ""I wish I could play it forever"", I think it's a pretty good game."
13430,I can’t believe I just found out the shark’s name is Bruce. Epic
13431,"What a fantastic game.
I play every single chapter update and finally the story come to THE END.
I continue my final chapter journey with my 2020 Raft.
I will never forget every inch of my journey.

Thank you dev for an awesome game and experience.
Here for Utopia and all the scout out there"
13432,"its very fun and creative
"
13433,very fun
13434,"Its a AMAZING game But I did have a glitch. So I explored some of the new snow world and tried going back to my raft but it was gone bc ig I forgot to anchor down so I went to a pre save and all the stuff I had in my inventory from before the pre save I still had so I doubled my food and kept all the stuff from the snow world I had gotten and I might be able to go back and get it all again. Hope this helps!

Edit: I did go back and yes I was able to get all the stuff again."
13435,good drowning simulator
13436,"I've played the game from the start of early access and can only say I've loved every minute of it. 

The atmosphere and enviroments just compell me fully and it has only gotten better over time!

10/10!"
13437,"I honestly expected more, over 2 years of development for Chapter 3 and is that all we get? It's definitely coming from my library now.

The first 2 chapters were nice and fun, but I was looking forward to the final chapter the most and was disappointed."
13438,nice game
13439,boat
13440,fun co op to play with your partner
13441,"Great gameplay, nice story and alright ending. Worth picking up now that the game has been finished. I look forward to seeing what Redbeet Interactive make next. Maybe even a sequel to Raft on a ice biome with skies/sleds."
13442,The game is full of bugs...sigh
13443,yah
13444,"Love this game, it allows for a lot of creativity through building. The islands are all different that you can find and explore and seem to be procedurally generated so that each play through is unique. There's a ton of tools to discover and research, lots of potential threats to encounter like sharks, wild boar, giant birds that chuck rocks at you, seagulls that eat your crops every 2 seconds. But this all makes for a nice challenge and a super fun game, whether alone or with friends. Definitely recommend."
13445,"fun game
"
13446,A fun twist on the crafting survival formula. Can sink many hours in the game building your raft or can blitz out the story in a few days. Worth the 20$ either way.
13447,"Yes
"
13448,Its so fun to play and AO is a tiny baby midget with a blue tongue
13449,"Played this game with my wife and many other friends,
- Very Enjoyable Experience
- Bunch of stuff to do !"
13450,Mumma Bear
13451,i lOVE how this game doesnt have boobies. BUT! Its got a bird dropping stones at your head and a shark eating yo arse.  'dislike that it doesnt have no boobies though!' smh ):
13452,Its fun to play with friends. I love survival games. The story is really nice too! I love the puzzles in this game!
13453,Fuck screechers they can die in hell and stay there
13454,"Great for casual play. Fun with friends. Fun alone.

Can fish in this game for days.

10/10 Highly recommended."
13455,Best game ever made! Please continue to make content even after this final chapter! :D
13456,I enjoy the discovery and relaxing nature of the survival. Though the shark can be annoying lol. Building up from a tiny raft to what ever your imagination dictates.
13457,it
13458,"This game is incredibly fun! I really enjoy unlocking all of the recipes and finding the numerous islands and abandoned rafts all over the ocean. Progressing isn't super challenging but there are some points where I find myself struggling to make it to the next day.
Multiplayer is great too! Of course the normal multiplayer related challenges arise - having to make 2 of everything, less space for the both of you, etc. - but I find it a whole lot more fun than singleplayer, especially when I get knocked down and need some assistance without having to lose 2/3 of my inventory.
My favorite part of the game by far is the building aspect. I feel that I can be so creative in what I make and the feeling that nothing is permanent makes my builds feel that much more special."
13459,Need more chapters :(
13460,"Its good 
"
13461,"Very fun and long, a bit complicated at times so I had to watch some walkthroughs but overall would 100% recommend."
13462,good
13463,"Amazing game, one of my favorites."
13464,Fun
13465,If i had a dollar every time the shark bites my raft i would buy steam
13466,yes
13467,"Ett riktigt roligt spel, speciellt med vänner!"
13468,"Super Fun Game. Lots of stuff to do and build, a little confusing at first but once it clicks its great."
13469,Really fun with friends!
13470,It's a great game but i personally couldn't bring myself to enjoy it solo.
13471,"I bought this game ages ago and finally its not ""alpha beta gamma"" version BUT it still not worth time and money.
#1 - Full of bugs
#2 -  Servers not working stably, sometimes it's unreal to connect to your teammate
#3 - Game play for few hours
Good idea, BUT bad final version"
13472,"Super
"
13473,"Good game, a little challenging in the beginning but I recommend playing with Friends"
13474,"fun game to play with friends, requires that you be strategic together, resourceful and creative. i have spent long nights playing this game and it never wears me out :D"
13475,"sexy game
"
13476,"Terrible game overall very repetitive don't waste your time with chapter 3 especially, lazy developers no effort put in. 
Reply with your opinion im curious"

13498,Very good game
13499,nice game and chill gameplay
13500,g
13501,"A fun but not perfect game.

The game starts pretty slow and if you are playing solo can be a bit frustrating trying to get started. The story is meh but passable.

Positives:
-Building mechanic is fun with a lot of customization
-Once you get established with collection nets it becomes fun
-Sailing is fun
-Story has some interesting events and unique feeling locations

Negatives:
-Pacing is a bit off. Starts super slow. Traveling from story point to story point or island to island can become dull by the end.
-I feel balance is a bit off in some places. The amount of wood you go through seems a bit much in early game. I don't like how everything wears out and wears out quickly. That is more annoying than anything.
-The world is nice and somewhat alive but with all of the large open spaces it does feel dead at times. Not sure how to fix that.
-Not much replayability
-I feel the game could use a bit more help with understanding resource sources. For example, I beat the game without wool or bees. Even with the bug net I couldn't seem to capture the swarms and just thought there was another way of doing it.

Overall I would recommend Raft for someone looking for a fun game but not expecting the next Subnautica. This game does a lot of things well enough but doesn't really excel in any one area. If the developer chooses to make a sequel I would hope some of the negatives would be addressed.

"
13502,i like the story
13503,Bruce
13504,"raft is fun water game dont drown idiot
"
13505,awesome game
13506,"The shark won't stop... and it can't stop...
For you have dishonored their family!"
13507,"A very slow paced and boring game even with friends. There is totally 0 instructions on how to play or what to do and a shark that eats your raft every few minutes as if I have murdered his family or something. Not even sure how this game got ""Overwhelmingly positive"" on its launch day. Overall, do not recommend the game even if you really like survival games and have a lot of time to burn on a mundane and repetitive game."
13508,yes
13509,I love this game
13510,fun survival game. some qol features need a bit of work but overall a good experience
13511,best game ever
13512,Great concept
13513,Love dropping wet brick on the boat
13514,"With the recent release of Raft 1.0 the game went from great to amazing. Raft is both relaxing and exciting. You can build, you can adventure, you can fight. With a friend or two this game can easily give you hours and hours of good fun, but even for solo players the athmosphere this game creates is something else."
13515,great game
13516,"This game is honestly just not that great. It starts cute with you strugleing to get food and drink, improve your raft and discovering a few things. Than really quickly you start to figure out the game doesn't have more to offer than it gave you in the beginning except that you can do the same stuff in a slightly different way.
Than there is combat, which is probably the worst. It is not difficult necessarily since every one of them basically requires you to run in a direction to prevent being hit and hit after they attack.  The enemies have a large amount of health requiring you to do the same boring combat for a long time and breaking your weapons you then need to craft again and again.
The exploring of the islands is mostly walking and being annoyed by the next enemy you are going to have to spend the next 3 minutes killing. 
The best part is probably being on the raft expanding it slowly, but as already stated after the first few hours you can do everything you need to and new stuff is usually a slightly better but much more expensive way of doing the same thing. Making progress not feel really useful"
13517,cool
13518,The shark tastes good
13519,"good game to play with friends

13531,i get bitten by gura
13532,"All this time in early access and now full release and they STILL haven't balanced the absolutely ridiculous food and water consumption rate, or even given you an option to adjust it.

Easy difficulty is FAR too easy, and anything above easy has absolutely ridiculous food and water drain which means you spend 70% of the playtime searching for food."
13533,A piece of wood on water. Nice
13534,"chill game, great to team up with a mate and work thru together.  just watch out for the annoying sharks.  easy to learn the crafting for items and inventory."
13535,shark
13536,Really Fun game if you are not playing alone
13537,"Soundtrack is magnificent!

Can also wear animal heads"
13538,gud
13539,super fun multiplayer game fun to chill too
13540,SHARK!!!
13541,"Ok hi I just want to say in a few words my opinion on this game.
Raft is the best game in the world I have played so far I plow it full I love it so much and I want it to have many more updates it is a game so invested and fun really wow I love it so much and it has very great potential Good luck to you"
13542,very good game.  The concept is cool. Hours of fun
13543,Amazing survival game. Perfect graphics. Great storyline. Would definitely recommend!
13544,gud
13545,"It's basically Minecraft on water with environmentalist undertones.

Very addictive game."

13557,Very fun survival. Finally coming back to it after I heard about its full release and I am very excited!
13558,good
13559,"Pro: Best raft building game, enemies with unique attacks, excellent survival and adventure game 
Con: Severe off-line bugs that are not being fixed. I have significant connection drops and cannot recommend any game that can't be played off-line, especially one that used to play perfect off-line"
13560,very sexy game
13561,good game
13562,"My favorite part is when the main character says ""It's rafting time"" then rafts all over the sharks. Truly A rafterpiece and I can understand why it sold a raftillion copies."
13563,"It's a really good game and it would be even better if there was more then just 1 shark, like variants like hammerheads, megalodon (1%) spawn chance, whale shark etc!"
13564,cool game .. but full of glitchs .!!
13565,FUN
13566,Hotel building simulator
13567,Awesome and very time consuming game if you let it be.  I love the build side of it so have not done the missions too much
13568,good
13569,i cold play this for the rest of my life
13570,"Good stuff
"
13571,"Fun game, better with friends. Solo is harder, especially with the psycho shark.
Peaceful can be fun if you just want to float around looting things."
13572,W
13573,it good
13574,"Been really enjoying the game up until 1.0, 

It's a pretty game, can be quiet relaxing, if you have people to play with it's a good chill game, BUT!!!

The devs assume you have friends, if you don't, then good luck playing the game on any difficulty but Easy, 

Solo difficulty options is like this, 
""Story Mode""
 ""Easy""
 ""Hard (you lose 2/3 of your inventory and/or damage your items to 1 use left)""
 ""hardcore ( [b] we want to remind you, you have no friends [/b] )""

Your character can hold 400x their body weight but you run  very slowly this gets annoying exploring some of the mid game areas,

The immersion of being alone is ruined Very fast by the addition of a trading post, with music and lights found on the first medium sized island you come across so 20 mins into the game, (you can't actually use said trading post till mid/late game)

i could rant all day, but i can't be bothered, enjoy the troll positive reviews, 

Worth the price? sure! got friends? sure!
"
13575,i dont like hyena
13576,Good if you like adventure and grinding
13577,very good game to play with friends and to have fun and is a really good survival game no doubt!!

13584,shark
13585,i love this game i hope i can play with a friend soon
13586,"really good, shud get"
13587,If you like the forest you might like this game. It has the same open world adventure. When you start out it might be boring but when you exspand your raft more and more it becomes fun. There are also a few islands with puzzels you can go to that are part of the story.
13588,"It's genuinely just too irritating to play. I spent like 5-10 minutes rowing towards a giant island in the distance, using all my materials, frantically crafting new paddles as they wore out, only to have it disappear right before I reached it. My experience has been full of moments like this where you're just annoyingly grinding but to no avail. It's just not for me. It's almost poetic that I am throwing in the towel 2.1 hrs in, making me unable to get a refund aha. I guess I'll play in the sandbox mode for a while to get my money's worth."
13589,Awesome Story and Building game should check it out if thats your thing
13590,best game
13591,"Really liked the genuine survival aspect of the game. However it is fairly difficult to craft sustainable items and you end up just collecting to survive and not progressing. The hostile creatures also make it very difficult to gather the one or two valuable items on a massive island.
"
13592,Raft.
13593,"With life going on, I get a lot of stress from work. This game was what I was looking for. Relaxing, fun to play with friends and I can get off whenever I want. I hope the devs will keep making more contents for this game. I am more than happy to pay extra for DLC or contents. 

Would play/10"
13594,Recommend listening to Wicked Game while sailing
13595,"10/10, rhino shark gave me PTSD"
13596,no
13597,there are cool places you can go. This is also a game i will find myself playing again
13598,Shark Pog
13599,"So I was very hopeful for Raft. It had been in beta for a millennia and the one update with the city was really cool. Seems like Raft developers were told they had to release ""or else"" because this last island is stupid, lacks any significant content, and is just boring. There's like two oil rig platforms or something?

Also it broke all the mods which made this game playable. You run at the speed of a geriatric.

Yeah, the developers definitely want nothing more to do with this game and to get on with their lives."
13600,"Let me preface with the fact that myself and my group of about 7 friends found this game just after the Pandemic hit us in early 2020. It was the escape we all desperately wanted and needed. The game is engaging and so much fun. We've spent hours and hours building up our party-house boat, collecting resources, battling Bruce. Now that the game is up and running in full, we are back at it again. There are even more of us now. We love the funky sense of community it gives us as we rediscover story beats and plot points of the game. If you are looking for a a fun time, pick this one up. All ten of us would highly recommend it. Happy Rafting!!"
13601,Love it
13602,THIS GAME SUCKS!!!!!!!!!
13603,mean shark cool gam e :)

13633,its fun with friends
13634,yeh
13635,Its good with friends
13636,I love the different destinations that they provide to keep the game interesting. The shark provides the foreboding feeling of something going wrong while trying to maintain your hunger and thirst. It's a great game to play with friends and tests to see if you can truly survive if left stranded on a raft.
13637,yes
13638,I love Barbra
13639,Absolutely LOVE this survival game. The husband and are I supper excited that the final chapter is out so we can continue our adventure. :D
13640,Most relaxing adventure survival game ever. The only game i have where grinding is enjoyable and peaceful until the stupid shark starts eating your raft
13641,the game is not just based on one task. epic journeys that can be adventured with friends!
13642,Raft is a fantastic casual co-op game.  I play with my daughters and we have a blast. I recommend not looking up any spoilers and just discovering the game.  It gets deeper and deeper.  Its great.
13643,good game I like irt
13644,10/10 would be bit in the arse by sharks again
13645,Gud raft game. shark bad.
13646,"Raft is a great game to play when you are bored. I'd recommend to press ""t"" once you start out, as it opens the tutorial book. However, it doesn't have much about things later in the game, so you should also check YouTube and Google for help. Also, bring a friend. It takes up more resources to keep the both of you alive, but it makes the game so much more worth it.
I love this game and the new update, and I wish it were more popular."
13647,I WON THE GAME!!!!!!!
13648,"In 1995, Chuck Noland, a systems analyst executive, travels the world resolving productivity problems at FedEx depots. He lives with his girlfriend, Kelly Frears, in Memphis, Tennessee. During a family Christmas dinner, Chuck is summoned to resolve a work problem in Malaysia. The FedEx cargo plane he is on gets caught in a storm and crashes into the Pacific Ocean. Chuck is the only survivor and escapes with an inflatable life raft. The next day, he washes up on an uninhabited island.

Over the next few days, several FedEx packages wash ashore, as well as the corpse of one of the FedEx pilots, whom Chuck buries. Chuck tries to signal a passing ship and escape in the damaged life raft, but the incoming surf tosses him onto a coral reef, injuring his leg. He is able to find sufficient food, water, and shelter. Chuck opens most of the FedEx packages, finding several useful items, but does not open a package with a pair of golden angel wings painted on it. While attempting to start a fire, Chuck cuts his hand. He furiously throws several objects from the packages, including a Wilson Sporting Goods volleyball, leaving a bloodstained imprint. After calming down, Chuck draws a face into the smeared blood, names the ball Wilson, and begins talking to it. He continues to talk to it regularly during the rest of his time on the island.

Four years later in 1999, a long-haired and a bearded Chuck has moved into a cave. After a large section from a portable toilet enclosure washes up on the island, he builds a raft, using the plastic as a sail. Chuck successfully launches the raft that he has stocked with water and the unopened FedEx package. Chuck and the raft survive a storm, but afterward, Wilson falls off the raft and floats away. Chuck awakens and futilely attempts to rescue Wilson but is left to grieve over his loss. Soon after, he is rescued by a passing container ship.

Upon returning to civilization, Chuck learns that he was declared dead by his family and friends. Later, a spruced-up and a clean-shaven Chuck returned to a hero’s welcome home party at the FedEx Headquarters in Memphis. Kelly has since married and has a daughter. Chuck goes to Kelly's house and reunites with her. They are both still in love with each other, but both know that Kelly cannot abandon her family. On a rainy night, she gives Chuck his old Jeep, and they part ways. Chuck drives to Texas to return the unopened FedEx package to its sender. Finding no one home, he leaves the package at the door with a note saying that the package saved his life. He departs in his truck (where he has bought another Wilson volleyball and put it in the passenger seat) and stops at a remote crossroads. A woman in a pickup truck stops and gives information about where each road leads. As she drives away, Chuck notices an angel wing painted on the tailgate of her truck, identical to the one on the parcel. He looks down each road, trying to decide which way to go. In the end, Chuck then stares down the road the woman took and smiles.

13649,This game is really inclusive and a fun game to play with others.. I have been playing this game for a month
13650,"Game is really well made and can lose track of hours just playing really fun game, now its all done and has a good story line"
13651,"I started the game and began looking for sustainable food and water sources, just like I do in every survival game. Unfortunately, Raft gives the player absolutely no guidance whatsoever in this regard, which, when combined with the game's procedural level generation, led to me starving to death almost immediately. And frequently.

During one of my lives, I managed to build a small planter plot, but for some inexplicable reason, the developers decided that not only can you NOT put a planter pot on an island (standing there with my finger pointing at nothing, for minutes at a time with no prompt or help text at all), but also that the small planter cannot hold seeds for much of the food I found. So I scrounged for a seed of the right size, found and planted a potato seed, waited an irrationally long time to harvest it, ate the new potato, and was rewarded with ZERO seeds afterward.

With no other resources in sight, and my hunger meter always on empty, I felt I had no choice but to uninstall. Terrible first time user experience."

13672,kill Grace (aka) the shark
13673,"This is a great game for the first few hours. Collecting resources and trying to survive on the open ocean is a great concept and was one of the only games we played as a family but the ending is what destroys this game. *spoilers ahead*

The ending was not worth the time and was anticlimactic for all of the overly tough parkour and the seemingly unwinnable boss fights in a game that was not designed for combat by any means. We found it hard to kill the rhino shark and that was in peaceful because the rhino shark yeets you that far from the bubbles that you die and that's not even counting the damage from the initial impact! Most of the fight was spent figuring out what to do but ended up looking it up on the internet. We also began chapter 3 from a save that was at the end of chapter 2, so we had no characters unlocked. This point is minor but I don't want to sail from the Utopia to the radio tower then to bear island just for playable characters! I would recommend starting from scratch if you already have a saved game. The final chapter also seems rushed with a last minute addition of an antagonist and a bs story line in the Utopia where Olof has 100s of hyenas... I just didn't understand it at all...

I loved this game at the very start but began to dislike it the more I played. If you want survival, this is the game for you but if you want an in depth story that is a blast to play through, don't buy it.

And also the grind for titanium is a pain in the ass."

13688,"100% dev team ruined this game with the final chapter.   The puzzles arent that difficult, but they put some serious idiotic parkour sections in, just to troll the players.  What's worse, if you stumble into the final boss fight unprepared, because you didn't realize it was the final boss fight, EVERY WORLD BACKUP SAVE YOU HAVE, GET OVERWRITTEN AND LOADS YOU RIGHT BACK INTO THE BOSS FIGHT UNPREPARED!.   THIS HAS RUINED MY MAIN GAME AND WASTED HOURS OF MY TIME.  FUCK THIS GAME!"

13759,"(SMALL SPOILER ABOUT ENDING) 
Would I recommend this game? Yes and no. If you're looking for something casual and not as interested in following a story to the end, it is a fantastic game. I have spent countless hours throughout the years and i love it. 
If you're looking for a story with an ending that makes you feel like you accomplished something, I would not recommend. 

This has been one of my go to games for years. I started when there was just a raft and a hook. 
Every update and chapter was this exciting adventure. All this lead up and promise from previous chapters that a well thought out ending was in the works. Finally a real hope for humanity to survive this world! Maybe all that I have done to prep and build was to help humanity thrive. Use all these skills that I have acquired to better this utopia in some way.   
The pictures of new tools were refreshing! There aren't that many options in the game and now that they're adding more combat, it made sense that they would add more options for damage. Unfortunately, after beating the final boss of the game, you get to make the new weapons and tools. What now? Go to islands to collect the same stuff all over again? for what point? I made this new sword and killed the same shark that I have killed a thousand times. What else am I supposed to do with it? You spend all this time getting to the end to save utopia (a small raft). All for the npcs to tell you that they're unhappy and disappointed. That is exactly how I felt."
13760,A ton of fun! I definitely recommend playing with friends as it makes it way better. My only problem is how short the story is. I hope the story will continue on a rolling basis.
13761,it good

13770,"This game.

Alright so to preface this: 
I myself played raft all the way back when it was on itch io. That was before it released here. I then played it a bit but took a huge break after each chapter. Now that the last chapter is out, me and two of my friends speedran through it.

44 ingame days until the end. around 18 hours (While knowing what to do and doing it fast).

I did not regret a single second. I did not regret a single cent paid for this. This game, made by a small studio, is great. There is no other word to describe it. A good story, good concept, good execution.

Nothing else to say really. Get it, it's only 20€.

And have fun with this game."

but the thing with this game is just slow paced. Mostly of the time you gotta be going on your boat and waiting to see what happens. The first island that I found I left my boat and it just left me behind ""I UNDERSTAND THE CURRENT JUST TOOK MY BOAT"" but I could not play because the items just spawns close to a boat. I had to leave and start the game over. 
This game for me is a 5/10 and I requested a refund because is just not my taste."

13840,This game is an exiting survival game with all sorts of fun features.
13841,"Fun crafting and building. There is a slight learning curve. I had to delete my first two worlds because I randomly got stuck on an island before I could build a paddle, but once i got things going and figured out the crafting system it is a lot of fun. Graphics are acceptable, but don't stand out by any means. My main complaint is that the game is very unforgiving early on, and thirst and hunger bars drain way too fast throughout the game. Even when you have an ample supply of food, you will frequently have to stop what you are doing just to eat and drink.

My Score: 8.5/10

Tips: You need to be able to sustain your character (food water) and move your raft (paddle, sail) as soon as possible. Wood is fuel for many things. The shark is constantly attacking you as well, so you will need a weapon.

Build a spear first. Apply it to an inventory slot with a left hand number (1-4). When the shark starts eating your raft poke him with the spear until he goes away. Eventually he will die and you can harvest the meat, but he will respawn soon after. Second Item you should build is the hammer. This lets you repair your raft and build more components. Your grapple is your lifeline. It also wears down very fast. you can minimize wear/damage by leaving your rope out and timing it so you grab multiple items on the way in. By the time you build your spear and hammer though, your grapple will likely have significant damage. For this reason I recommend making a backup grapple third and a backup spear fourth and then make a stone hatchet. If you want to get off your raft (to explore an island) make sure you have an anchor, or your raft will float away and the only way to get back is to die and lose 2/3 inventory. Make a water purifier as soon as you can, and then a cooking pot. From here you probably need some storage containers. At this point collection nets are very useful. you can build them into your raft bottom (they don't have to be on the edge). I recommend an X or T pattern so your raft will capture anything it floats over in any direction. I don't know if these tips are meta, but this is what worked for me."

13843,"if you are alone its eh but if you get around 3-4 people its really fun . Also 5+ people is kinda too much , especially if you are all talking in the same place"
13844,YESSIRRRR
13845,"just an amazing game, peaceful, thrilling, exciting and just overall, fun!"
13846,halo
13847,OMG GOOD
13848,"Very fun, I bought right before official 1.0 release, and they really have added a LOT. I'm 30 hours in, and I'm guessing just finishing the story could take 10-20x this long (300-600 hours depending how you play).
I imagine you could put in many more hours going through all the items and building a ""cool"" raft, not just one for survival.. Just speed running maybe you could do in less than 300 hours, and depending how much you look up as opposed to find out yourself...
The multiplayer is so fun, and I'm pretty early on but I'm loving it."

13851,good game
13852,fix the server please
13853,fun if you have friends

13855,A well designed building game in the first few chapters becomes a miserably designed combat and parkour game in the final chapter.
13856,"Overhyped, Overpadded, time wasting Garbage"
13857,buy it.
13858,This game good solid 10/10
13859,........................
13860,"Great game, I'm excited to return to the game for the final chapter update."
13861,"good game sometimes calm sometimes scary just the right mix of these 2.
"
13862,"Love to play this with my best friend, it really makes you work as a team and there's always something to do!"
13863,cool but many bugs
13864,"good game, me like"
13865,"Good game, started from my chapter 2 save. glad they finished the story, added so much stuff, Achivments werent to hard, one of the few games that i enjoyed and may replay"
13866,gud gaym
13867,i like it with a Yes and a no
13868,gud
13869,Great game for survival just lacks of many things and still lots of bugs like regarding to the characters
13870,BEST GAME I HAVE EVER PLAYED #HIGHLYRECOMMEND  #WORTHDYINGFOR
13871,"Nice game, challenge 
"
13872,Today I learned that a sharks favourite food is wood.
13873,Never been so happy to see trash
13874,"amazing game , masterfully crafted 10/10 recommended if you have a friend to play with"
13875,look at the purple rv house at the bottom of the third picture on steam :)
13876,If you like survival and base building you will LOVE this.
13877,We named the shark a certain race and and now we constantly say we hate that race :)
13878,Very cool game
13879,"I love the game and always find it fun, there is some annoying things though, like the amount you have to eat even on easy. I don't know who can eat an entire water melon and then still have to eat 3 fish just to be full for a few hours. It would be great if they can add more control for settings on how you play the game. I would like the option to turn my hunger rate down and how frequently a new shark spawns, other than that i love the game and can play it for hours."
13880,love raft
13881,GG
13882,Excellent for bonding with your step son.
13883,It's a fun game. A little frustrating at times. But overall pretty good
13884,Love this game. I prefer playing it with a friend though.
13885,very nice game!
13886,top game
13887,gameplay
13888,I bought this since it look rather nice.  I should have read that I would be relegated to keyboard controls with no controller support.  Wish I could refund it.  Awkward controls and very clunky compared to beautiful games like subnautica.
13889,"Unable to retrieve items from corpse on death, unless you start the game in easy mode. For that reason alone I can't recommend this game."
13890,good.
13891,Has everything the game claims to have. You even start on said Raft.

13898,"great game

13899,slow to start but once you figure things out its a blast
13900,i lost my goat
13901,"great game... fuck sharks, birds, and bears though, its on sight with them bitches
"
13902,"Personally, the gameplay isn't bad.  What gets to me, is to advance in getting decent tech you have to advance the story line.  I am totally in tune with that, until it gets to the point.  The point where it become the go to the 2nd floor, to go to the 4th floor, to go to the 3rd floor, to go to the 1st floor, to go to the fifth floor, go back to the 2nd floor.. .you get the jist.  Honestly though,  The game is solid.  The errors and bugs are minimal if at all.  My biggest issue is if you want anything resembling a decent raft, you'r stuck with hours of extremely convoluted puzzles, in the dark, all over creation, that are just at least in my opinion just too long winded for their impact.  Otherwise, I would actually STRONGLY suggest this game
"
13903,Maganda lalo na with friends ^_^
13904,good
13905,nice game
13906,"My friend and I went through an entire playthrough of the game just to buy more dream catchers!!

13922,"I liked the game concept, however there is alot of very wild idea's about crafting that really removes me from the emmersion, like using sea-weed to make motherboards, but my #1 grip is that if i'm saving my game ""constantly"" and i die I CANNOT go back ANY save. that should be a players option, or why even have a ""save"" choice in the game"

13929,fuck this game
13930,"Fun, chill, enjoyable"
13931,"Used to be a really good game, until they broke it with the 1.0 update. Now it won't even load. It crashes on the loading assets screen. Seems to be a fair few people with this problem too. Waste of money. Avoid until they decide to fix this issue."
13932,i hate the shark
13933,"The game is fun at times an the story is great but it is a torture to get to see all of it. When you die you lose 2/3 of your inventory. This feels worse than when you lost your full inventory because it is like the devs saying ""We hear that you don't like to lose your inventory but we don't really care. Go tell your friends to buy the game."" Why couldn't you do what every other game has done and drop the items where you die?"
13934,cool
13935,This is my calm feel good game. Its relaxing and fun and I enjoy the puzzels and survival aspect but I also love that they put so much into the story
13936,10/10 a ton of fun with friends
13937,"Reminds me a lot of Wind Waker, running into new islands and figuring out their secret.

Feel like the food/thirst system, while neat, is a little demanding on normal difficulty and I imagine higher. I recommend playing on easy, so you can give more attention to raft building and exploring than running around trying to keep your bars full.

But there's a lot of personality in this game, and a lot to love."

13939,Nice shark tits
13940,"- loots gigantic piece of plastic from the sea
- gives just 1 plastic
- craft a mini cup to have a sip of water

progressing in this game is way to long.
4/10
"
13941,Very cool gayme
13942,"The game puts stuff for me to interact with on islands but then it also puts birds there that drop rocks on me and even though I respawn 2 feet from where I died, my inventory is just lost forever."
13943,"Very fun, especially in co-op."
13944,"GG EZ
"
13945,very fun game
13946,"great game with friends
"
13947,"I was hoping on full release this game would be better then what I played in 2018, the hunger and resource system in this game are still the same and still as poorly designed for ""normal difficulty"", eating an entire melon gives you 10% of your hunger back which last about 30 seconds I expect like myself most people just drowned themselves through the game"
13948,"This game is pretty mediocre i'd say but i'm a complete stranger who's opinion doesn't really matter,but if you take this into consideration I think this game is good not $20 good but still good, you can get some good laughs out of this game but it wont last for the longest. Eventually this game gets repetitive and kind of boring even though there are frequent updates. After a while of playing i was getting really bad headaches and didn't really feel good because of the constant swaying of the water. Overall I say this game is good but if you want it, get it during a sale so you don't completely waste you'r money."
13949,e
13950,A blast
13951,i had to fart
13952,Fun to play just needs more frequent updates.

13955,Fun game with friends
13956,Yeah its pretty freakin dank ig
13957,"I played so long that I lost track of time and I had work the next morning. 8.5/10, it has some bugs."
13958,"Ok....so..... somehow this ended up being literally one of the best games I've ever played. 

Don't let the ""kiddy"" graphics and ambiance lead you astray - this game is very much for adults as well. 

The story line was brief and spread-out, but somehow more than enough to satisfy the requisites to be a real adventure game. 

The crafting system quickly becomes ultra complex, with like a hundred different items to make and use, and the basebuilding is not only intuitive, well thought out, and quick - but also.......it's a FREAKIN BOAT. There's simply no limit to what you build and how you build it...plus it floats. Genius! 

These guys hit the nail on the head."
13959,"its fun, play it"
13960,super
13961,yup.
13962,very addicting game it doesnt seem like much at the start but as you progress you get more invested in your progression and the lore of the characters and it becomes more enjoyable over time :D
13963,Good
13964,vc
13965,"good game, but the hunt aspect in this game ( hit point, aim ) is a little bit glitchy, that makes the hunt and killing animal not doable."
13966,it's relaxing.
13967,GOOD
13968,RAFT!!!
13969,good stuff
13970,james the touched me so i give thumbs down and a police report
13971,The idea and concept of this game is better than the reality. It's extremely buggy and the core game play is full of holes.
13972,"Seeing that Raft Update pop up on my Steam news has been the highlight of my year.
Granted it hasn't been a very good year, but this is definitely the best part!

I'm comin' for ya Brucey. We have a score to settle."

You loose 2/3rds of the stuff you had to salvage when fall into the water and the shark eats you.  Second go I see an island I jump off and swim for it not knowing that there is no way to make another raft even if you are able to collect enough resources to make one, no way to place an table for research on the island, cant place a sleeping bag or anyway to cook.  what a load of crap game this was, fastest refund request i have ever made."

13996,"Very fun to play with multiple people, but I can see it being pretty difficult playing by yourself."
13997,"I don't like Jeff. He nibbles on my foot after I specifically told him not to. He stared into my eyes and told me he wouldn't do it again, and five seconds later, he tore off my foot. Now I am one foot down, in a whole lot of pain, but at least I got the seaweed. It was worth it."
13998,It is very fun and it is almost a sandbox game where you can do anything you want to your raft and overall it is a great game but I don't recommend it to players who have a laggy computer because raft is a big game.
13999,Good

14012,"Raft is a hell of a lot of fun. If you like survival games like Don't Starve, you get a lot of the same resource management. If you're more of a Minecraft person, there's plenty of building to keep anyone satisfied. The storyline felt like it could use the most work, but the latest update gave it an overhaul that fixed any issues I had. I think this is a great game, for whatever difficulty you prefer."
14013,"Really good at the beginning but in the mid game it becomes very difficult and annoying to die to all living creatures, land, ocean, and sky. It also doesn't help that tools are flimsy, most items you create WILL break and have SHORT lifespans, creating this stressful grind for materials that may not be available to you, especially when you are on one of the massive plot islands.

Overall really good game, but has incredible balancing issues."

14017,IUYGVY
14018,Raft is amazing and has lots of stuff to do I highly recommend this game if you like helping the ocean and getting juicy loot. very poggerz champerz
14019,so fun to play with others
14020,"So.... Me and my friend just finished the final chapter of raft and let me tell you. I don't know if we are missing something but i kinda feel disappointed in this update, i get that there are new characters to unlock and we haven't unlocked them all yet, but still i feel disappointed, because it literally the last update they will release so I was expecting more 😕 Is it just me that feels that way or other people do too? Other than that the game is very fun to play."
14021,good game
14022,its fun
14023,"Raft was a nice relaxed game with lite survival elements that had a fair sense of progression.  AT some point the development shifted away from the raft building and survival, and became a large island exploration game with awful combat and way too much useless space and flora.  The early to mid game balance is now somewhat unforgiving and frustrating.

The 1.0 release got the game to the finish line in terms of story and progression, but much of the early and mid game are very unbalanced and unfun now.
If you aren't turned off by the relentless attacks of animals you did not provoke, cannot avoid, and cannot deal with early on, you might stick around long enough to see some of the interesting content.  Considering that by default dying makes you lose 2/3 of your hard-earned inventory... which can sometimes put you into a death spiral,,, I would be surprised if people new to Raft even bothered to see beyond it.

Redbeet; now that the end has come, please go back and iron out the rest.
So many things need attention to make this game feel alive and complete.  Story and crafting items are just bricks in the wall.. but if the mortar holding them in place is weak or just plain absent, it's all for nothing.

Raft has potential.  It had charm and enough systems to keep you mucking about.  But Raft's potential hasn't been realized in my opinion because seemingly simple things are just unbalanced, frustrating, or disappointing.
In some stages of Early Access I would have recommended giving Raft a try.  But as 1.0 approached, and now with final release... the game is not the same and I cannot recommend it for what it has become."
14024,Fun but Trama is there
14025,chapter 3 is disappointing..
14026,It is ok.
14027,"9/10! As of the newest Update (the Final Chapter) my friend and I cooped the whole game from start to finish. The flow was much improved, the voice acting great, and the length was good too!  Impressed with the new content over all, and only gripe being we werent too sure on how to get enough  [spoiler] titanium to make the high end machines. We assumed it was something to do with the metal detector, but as soon as we made it, the small islands just stopped spawning. Also, giving us the titanium weapons and tools at the very end of the game was a bit anti-climactic. [/spoiler]. Coming back to this game after a year and a half was very much worth it. Highly recommend if you are looking for a fun coop game to have some laughs with your friends."
14028,I started Playing this game from the beginning. Really enjoyed playing with friends. about to start the Finals chapter.
14029,more realistic minecraft on water.
14030,relaxing game
14031,cool game
14032,FUN
14033,I really like Raft I'd recommend this game for people that like shark and survival games just remember to make sure the shark doesn't eat you!
14034,"I played ARK with a wooden raft base traveling around and expanding my living space in time while having time to gather every source and grind something from the deep ocean. And that wasn't the games main idea at all. 

Than I discovered RAFT realizing they inspired from all of the similar survival games and add some mechanics 
and an ok story to it but it's actually just a little part of my adventure from another game's 600+hours of gametime."
14035,nice water
14036,"Absolutely terrible game, tried to play local multiplayer several years ago, lag was unplayable. Tried again on full release, still awful. Game is unplayable in multiplayer."
14037,full peen ahead lads
14038,Verry fun to play and is funner to play with multiple people. it can be complicated at some times you you learn as you go along
14039,For a complete game it has so many bugs and flaws.  Great concept and worth to buy on sale if you are bored.
14040,good game
14041,"This game is utterly amazing. Everthing is relitivly simple and just fun. the game contains alot of advneture and it is kinda like hiking  a big nice mountain, you never know when you reach the topp/end and you always get overhelmed over how much more there is left to d0!.

14056,There is absolutely no way that the developers spent 5 years making 3 more islands. They promised more content than the first two chapters combined and they did NOT deliver. Terrible ending also.
14057,"What an addicting game! So easy to lose track of time as you try to survive and build the best raft out there. Haven't even got to the ""story"" mode yet and am still having a blast"

14063,"No thoughts; Head Empty, Happy Boat Game > Greater than any therapy I've gotten in life.  11/10 Would recommend time and time again!"
14064,A bit challenging in the beginning but once you get going it just gets better and better.
14065,.
14066,good game :)
14067,Awesome game
14068,"Every time I buy this game, i am amazed that steam keeps letting me refund it. Always get into the mood for a good survival game, and it always seems like it'd scratch the itch. But Then you realize, that even with friends. After 4 hours you still haven't accomplished anything and it makes you sad. 

Do not recommend unless you plan on spending a few days getting to the ""fun"" part"
14069,"I love this game, but how are you gonna introduce a surf board to the players, and NOT let the players ride it :("
14070,"I think this game is good defenly i havent tryed to finish the game but i have joined 1 of my freinds world and then saw his progress it was fantastic i havent seen anything like so im gonna play with him soon and 1 of his freinds its gonna be great
"
14071,"Smooth and exciting game play for those who enjoy story driven survival games. The multiplayer is also great fun and easy to use.
Worth playing if you have time on your hands."
14072,y e s
14073,nice
14074,Fun Game
14075,yea its good 10/10
14076,Raft is a great game if you hade someone to play with because it gets pretty lonely if you play by yourself but its a really good game no doubt about it
14077,"great, but it takes a decently long time to progress. It is both calming and somewhat stressful at the same time. I would recommend this to people who have 3 or 4 hours to kill at the end of their day."
14078,very gud very niiiice very gud very nice
14079,"What an awesome game. Would be cool if the shark got bigger as the you progress and breached out of the water onto the deck, breaking chunks off."
14080,"Raft is personally a really good game, I love everything about it I’d have to say the most satisfying thing in it is the music. I usually play after I get back home from work tired. The music is very relaxing I hope they never change anything about it. It somehow is very similar to Minecraft, but at the same time completely different. I have played many survival games and none such as this incredible watery experience of a game. It is very immersive and has lots of unique details which sets itself apart from other game but overall, people who wants a survival game should download this ASAP! 10/10"
14081,you build a raft very nice
14082,"I love this game
"
14083,"Game has Llama,
me raise Llama,
me happy,
Llama drowns,
Llama gone,
me sad."
14084,sharks are the worse animal in the world  :)
14085,I like this game
14086,"There are 2 effective places to stab a shark, its mouth and its $hu$$y"
14087,new update when?
14088,play by yourself if ur bored or play with friends and have fun
14089,"Such a fun game, the story is great and if you really think about it, you can see how much work they put into just the story alone. I love everything about this game, play this game with friends though. Trust me it makes the experience a whole lot better. There are so many things to do and the new update just added so many new things, I started an entire new story with a friend just to see everything that changed. Please get this game if you have people to play it with and have been thinking about it. It's awesome."
14090,Really fun game.
14091,I liked the game until the final chapter came out a lot. It is charming and calming. But as I reached the junp and run at the last chapter it ruined the game for me. Unable to master it I now cant finish the story I think.
14092,fishy go brrrrr
14093,
14094,"Fantastic job to the Devs, the game has been a awesome experience and incredibly fun to play. My wife and I played the full game from start to finish, and its been a blast."
14095,"dog shit puzzle and boss fights
"
14096,cool
14097,yes
14098,"Great concept and execution. A wonderful mysterious tour of the ocean, complete with homicidal sharks and other critters. Best enjoyed with friends 10/10"
14099,really cool
14100,It's weird and still a little buggy but it is one of the purest resource-gathering-into-base-building concepts out there.
14101,"I've put a bunch of hours into this game, played with friends a lot and I can safely say this is the one game I know for sure I can recommend to people who want to give Survival Crafting games a shot. It's well optimized, runs amazingly smoothly, looks stylized but isn't aping other games and is just good, relaxing fun (if you can fight the shark...). One of the best Survival Crafters I've played and at $20 you're getting your money's worth and far [i]far[/i] more."
14102,YUMMY
14103,
14104,yeeeeeeeeeee cuz
14105,very edicting
14106,Fun
14107,I LOVE THIS GAME BECAUSE IT IS SO CREATIVE WOOH HOOO
14108,one of the greatest.... its def top tier game
14109,"this game is ass. like realy ass, not worth a single penny"
14110,game had a raft in it and i like
14111,u
14112,This game made my dad come back
14113,I'm really bad at this game
14114,"I enjoy yelling at my friends for not refilling the water, when secretly I was the culprit.  Bruce is the best pet shark I have ever had. 10/10 would clean plastic out of the ocean again."
14115,"Not the deepest game out there but playing solo provides a tranquil experience while still offering some  excitement due to the shark (and other things that will kill you).  Playing with friends is where the real fun is.  The addition of extra people collecting materials and performing simultaneous tasks like cooking, fishing, poking the shark, etc which will help in building bigger more elaborate rafts.  The story is kinda neat and there's tasks on the islands you need to complete to progress.  Overall, the game is engaging for a decent amount of time and makes for a great party game for friends spread out all over.  The only downside about playing with friends is one of you needs to host as there's no server so make sure the person hosting has a good internet connection and will be available to play when the majority is."
14116,love this game it is simple it can be played by yourself and still be fun
14117,Very good game yes :) Mucho grande explore
14118,"Been here since 2018...I don't even know how many times I've completed this game from start to finish. But now that the story's done, it's still just as fun if not more fun than before."
14119,nice
14120,shak atac bot
14121,The Shark hate me
14122,"best game ever
"
14123,"Its calming, relaxing and enjoyable, though i wish there would be more content and raft customization. 

Overall, would recommend other people playing this, though, it's more of a co-op game and it takes very long to play alone."
14124,just keep swimming
14125,it is one of the best survival games i have ever played
14126,Build a boat. set sail. laugh with a friend. its fun. Played since it was in beta
14127,YES
14128,one of my favorite games that i have played with my friends and it would be funny if they did raft in vr lol
14129,this game is the best! you can play with your friends and try to survive. there is also creative mode. i highly recomend you this game
14130,וחםםמינחנ
14131,gud gam
14132,"Raft, if you love puzzle, adventure, and a great storyline this is a great game for you. Raft will put your wits and mind to the test. With over 65 hours of Raft I love this game and have played it since it first came out and with the finally chapter just coming out it is the best time to join raft and explore all that awaits. Raft combines puzzle solving, adventure, combat, and a endless ocean with no end in site. All of those components really make the game stand out for most others and really challenge you. And if you just want to explore try easy, peaceful, or creative. Raft also provides a great story line, so if you love story games this is by far one of the best out there. And one finally thing please watch out for Bruce the shark, he does not want hugs he only wants your face!"
14133,kinda glitchy and a little grindy but pretty cool game
14134,so addictive
14135,it was a very create idea to play this. had a great shark time playing :}
14136,"As much as we liked the game, I cannot recommend it purely because it has the STUPIEST Auto Saving feature EVER build in a computer game.
It supposed to save backups every ten minutes, but if you die, those backups are COMPLETELY USELESS; you still getting load back where you were dead!
After 262 hours of play we just lost our only save file because of this STUPID mechanism.
Just save yourselves and avoid the frustration and STAY AWAY FROM THIS STUPID GAME!
"
14137,"played this game before, had to uninstall it for a time now coming back to it as it's a fun game"
14138,watch  out for da Sharks
14139,"amazing game, 10/10"
14140,Raft is honestly the best game I have ever played.
14141,Game sucks. Game is EXTREMELY counter intuitive. I had ti go the internet WAY too many times just ti figure out how to do the simplest things. I'm done.
14142,cool open world survival with the twist of being stuck in the ocean. Great story / story locations as well!
14143,I am god
14144,good
14145,yes/no
14146,very good game i recommend
14147,FUN
14148,you cant get burned out by playing it because there is so much to do in the game
14149,"Bought this game on EA release, to this day it has been neglected just to be officially released so they can officially abandon ship. Absolute horrible game, you stand on a raft and collect trash, to then go to 3 different locations.

Total story time: 3.5 hours (going normal speed)
You can waste your time collecting more trash just to make a fancy boat that has absolutely no difference in gameplay.. You just wasted hours making a boat for nothing.

In conclusion: I still feel scammed over $20 after all these years."
14150,Decent but would be great if there is more content.
14151,"This game is awesome for if your bored or if you want to play a game with your friends! The game is fun and there is so much creativity you can craft! There are so many items, blocks, and machines in this game! I would recommend this game for everyone!"
14152,Pretty slow and boring in my opinion. Feels very repetitive and grindy. Like.. It was fun for 2 hours maybe and that's about it.
14153,大多数游戏新手村在开头，raft的”新手村“在结尾。哪怕到了最后，你拥有了大家庭，也不要忘记自己辛苦建造的筏子，还有那条永远相伴的鲨鱼。
14154,"This is a fantastic game that just keeps getting better and better with every update! My friends and I have been playing this game on and off for years!
10/10 would highly recommend, even with some minor bugs that the dev team is working out"
14155,.
14156,Subnautica but on top of the water if you could bring your base with you.
14157,"Reminds us of just how much thrash can be found in the ocean... oh and lots of ""bruno's"" haha"
14158,nice
14159,"Has a great modding community. Base game is a bit lacking storywise, but it delivers nonetheless. I really enjoyed my time on the raft. If you like survival adventure games, you won't be disappointed."

14165,Extremely fun and occasionally challenging co-op game. Big recommend

14167,Good.
14168,I guess pollution is good cause because in this game its your best resource.
14169,"One of the chilliest and friendliest survivals out there, pretty fun and relaxed with friends."

Solo is also super doable and easy to manage, it's a lot more relaxing. 
Verdict: welllll worth the price, very addicting but in a relaxing way."

14180,Fun when you have got the smelter
14181,"Very fun so far, but a slight problem with the update on Temperance where when player 2 rides the snowmobile behind player 1, if they get off they fall through the floor to the water below. luckily the problem is temporary but hopefully it can be fixed"
14182,its good really good i would pay like 60 for this
14183,"great gameplay, great graphics, great performance, recommended"
14184,"Love to play this game with the bois.
My only issue is that you can't play Hard on single player. Well, it will let you, but without the option to respawn what's the point?"
14185,"pretty good

14187,It's fun accept it takes a lot of storage

14190,"As long as the FOV is limited to 90° it's a ""no"". I'm rather sensitive to motion sickness, and the constantly moving floor (=ocean) is giving me nausea."
14191,Great

14193,good game and fun
14194,good game played the story and it was fun there were some bugs and glitch's that made it hard to play sometimes but that's okay good game overall

14202,It's a fun relaxing game!

14204,Fun but my duo is stinky
14205,Raft is a very good game it reminds me of subnautica and sea of theives and i like the ocean:)
14206,OK
14207,"Super fun game to play with friends, you can build a community raft or even try to survive with just one buddy. Favorite part by far is killing bruce, and the added story line gives you an extra purpose beyond just making an awesome raft."
14208,ok
14209,Love the game! I recommend it to any survival game fanatic like me.
14210,"Kepala Hiu, Mania Mantab.. Mancing!!!"

14212,"Play with my BF and have just started all over again for the update. Can take it at you own pace or speed run it, Love this game."
14213,"Really cool game.
Havent played the new update tho."
14214,not worth the 2 year wait.
14215,i dont want to describe it
14216,Good Game
14217,Glad it finally Released from early access~ loving the game~
14218,"This is one of my favorite games to play with my husband. We each like very different games. My husband likes fast paced, action, progression games, where I like slower, survival, with heavy base build sort of games. It's so hard to find games to play together where we both enjoy. The biggest appeal for me is that as we travel and move forward in game and story, I can keep my base (raft) with me at all times. While my husband can keep moving forward and not feel frustrated by me slowing him down, yet we are still together.

tldr: if want to play with other people that like different games than you do, this is a great in between with something for everyone to enjoy."
14219,furry
14220,"I would recommend it and I'm too lazy to write a proper review. 

Buy it, don't buy it, I'm not a financial advisor or your mother."
14221,get friends and this game good otherwise its complete trash
14222,"tbh this game is just ok. Im glad i played and 'beat' it but i dont think i would ever play it again. I also dont think id play this game without my friends, although alek keep fucking with me and messing shit up. Most of the locations are pretty cool, you just have to be prepared with plenty of water and food. My biggest complaint is that you start to unlock all of the most advanced stuff towards the very end however they aren't required at all to progress the story. Because of this my friends and I simply ignored all late game gear. overall 6.5/10."
14223,"yes

"
14224,DOESNT SUCK DI CK
14225,Honestly i had to refund this product not only i got spawn trapped by a shark therefore making it impossible for me to even escape game got pretty boring fast.
14226,"I started playing this in early access, when only the first chapter was done and I’m so happy it has had its full release now! 

It’s a great game, great to play alone or with friends, the amazing chaos when you have 7 people on a tiny raft is hilarious!

It’s a well made game, even in EA it never had many bugs and the devs are always very fast at fixing the few that were.

It’s a raft building, survival game, great story and both relaxing and exiting. I really really recommend it!"
14227,"i hate that fucking shark
10/10"
14228,"10/10, will continue to play with my wife until the end of time"
14229,"We came a long way to reached our current raft - the time and energy spent on this, only to have our friendship ended halfway through the story. 

Nonetheless, still recommended for solo/friends."
14230,"This was probably one of the most boring games I have ever played in my entire life. You stand on a raft and throw a hook that breaks every three minutes at sticks that just happen to be floating by, to build more raft, that an asshole shark just comes over to destroy every five minutes."
14231,An awesome game with good graphics and a stunning story
14232,"Intensive survival, like it very much so far!"
14233,sharl
14234,W game buy it right now
14235,Jumping over a shark is realistic
14236,DUH
14237,great survival game
14238,"Game no longer works with recent update. I attempt to load a world, only for it to consume 6 GB of ram and filling it all up. The new update looks really promising, the game just will not load."
14239,"very fun hard to put down, and its even better with friends, but it is very buggy"
14240,The chillest game to attack me with a shark.
14241,A very relaxing experience
14242,Fun game
14243,e
14244,"While the survival aspects might be harsh and force you to get 20k calories every 12 hours, the story is great and well though our."
14245,yes.
14246,"this game was so good , if you enjoy crafting and building stuff this game might suitable for you"
14247,AWESOME
14248,"A bit of a drag in singleplayer as it's difficult to manage everything the game asks of you, but one of the finest multiplayer experiences ive ever had

long live the S.S. Sega Playstation"
14249,e
14250,GG
14251,"This is a really fun game! I have played it a great deal and am excited about the newest (and alas, last!) chapter. My advice for new players is that if you find the shark too frustrating, the best thing to do is to play on peaceful. There is no shame in letting the shark be your friend!"
14252,
14253,Stupid Bruce
14254,Been working on a mod called RAFT WARS  pvp   build weapons and break the enemy and salvage the wrecks of others
14255,i
14256,Got this game during early access and it was pretty fun. The team behind the game has put in a good amount of effort and fleshed the game out and v1.0 has been great. My final criteria is that I get 1hr/$1 spent on this game and I have achieved that plus some at time of review. Would highly recommend.
14257,GOOD
14258,"aMAZing, honestly didn't expect so much goodness when got this game. YOu can easily spend hours with your friends advancing your raft and following the story line islands. Seagull is best food :D"
14259,"Raft is a amazing game. the graphics are beautiful and never get old. the game play is always fun and (depending on your play style) doesn't require much grinding. the progression and story is very interesting. but most of all, the soundtrack. no other game has had such an amazing sound track. the music in this game is more than phenomenal and is probably the only game where i have the music volume all the way up. if you are even slightly considering buying this game. buy it now."
14260,"Sorry guys, the constant eating and drinking required in this game sucks all the fun out an otherwise amazing game.  Yeah, I realize it becomes easy to gather food and water as you progress but even then, eating and drinking consume such a large part of this game that it becomes incredibly tedious and boring.  Not sure why the devs did this and I am really confused why it is still an issue in 1.0.  Damn... you've got a good thing here that is spoiled with this mechanic."
14261,we need more games like this
14262,good
14263,FUN
14264,This game is great to play with friends
14265,A promising games that simply needs to have more content added to it and have a more fleshed out gameplay loop - especially towards the end of the game.
14266,"Have been playing this game pretty nonstop for the past few days and I love it so far! Great for people who (in survival-crafting games) love building bases, but hate to leave the cool base they made to actually... play the game. The base comes with you! It's a fun game, and I like that it lets you progress through the story at your own pace. I like the method of discovering the story, too; putting together what happened based on scraps of evidence and environmental clues is a lot more engaging than getting lore dumped on you.
The game also looks surprisingly good on even the fastest graphics settings, and runs at a solid 60 fps (with occasional stutters, but none too annoying) on my XPS laptop. Older games with simpler graphics run worse, so this is a pleasant surprise. The game does tend to lag when loading in large islands, which while helpful as a cheesy strategy to detect large islands if you're busy, is a little jarring. It doesn't affect playability in any way though, and honestly might just be my computer.

IDK if devs read the reviews, but that being said I find there are a few places where the game seems unpolished or could do with some quality-of-life/accessibility improvements:

- Better inventory management. Something like Stardew's ""transfer all to chest"" would be nice. Being able to sort the inventory the same way we can sort chests would also be a huge improvement.
- More feedback--feedback for different actions is kind of inconsistent; you can clearly tell from any distance if the grill is still running, but it's impossible to tell if a smelter is running unless it's facing you. The sound is pretty quiet, too, and blends in if you have several running at once. Maybe have smoke rising from the top, or have it glow a little?
- SOUND CAPTIONS. I personally have auditory processing disorder & having to turn up my game audio all the way to tell when things are happening is unpleasant. I assume for players who are Deaf or hard-of-hearing it's even worse, since sound cues are such an important part of the game.  Minecraft has a similar feature. There's already accessibility features in the game like the seasickness mode, which I really appreciate, so I hope they continue with that.
- The hitboxes for things are weird. The sail especially is annoying to operate-- if you're clipped into it, you can't open/rotate it, so you have to stand back and keep adjusting your position until you hit it perfectly. I also think that the whole anchor should be interactable to raise/lower, not just the tiny hitbox of the handle. And it would be nice if we could pick up items through leaves. I don't like having to just give up on an item that dropped on the ground when it's perfectly visible, but the bush is blocking me from picking it up for some reason.

Some of these are more nitpicky, and devs might not even read the reviews. I also don't want to sound too negative. These are all small things, and overall I'm really enjoying the game. 1.0 literally just came out two days ago, so I'm sure they'll be continuing to work on bugs and small stuff like this. And if you are reading this, hi! Thanks for making this game :)"
14267,"I haven't played much so far but it is a fun game with friends, but there is a lot of glitches but it just got full released so i was expect it to be a little buggy. also sometimes when you start a game your raft can get completely beach and you can't move because you don't have a paddle, but its a good game and i have fun playing it"
14268,"Minecraft 
But make it WET"
14269,I like the updates and new content as well as the new recipes and equipment. Dislike that previous recipes were removed rather than just added onto
14270,MMMMMMM DADDY.....
14271,big fat poopy
14272,"Only rating it up because it has a ""peaceful"" mode. All other modes/difficulties are pretty much rendered unplayable due to incessant shark/seagull attacks."
14273,good version of sea of thieves
14274,Shark
14275,tis fun with rafting with friends. I love the build aspect of the game though. Gotta collect all the trash from the sea. Stay away from the shark. he is a mean one.
14276,Great game
14277,"I played for an hour and refunded.  I couldn't figure out what I was doing at all, and the whole time was spend stressed and annoyed.  Maybe there is more of a game here, but I couldn't get to it.  I played on normal difficulty.  Yes, I know there are easier difficulties, but the game isn't hard.  It's just annoying and repetitive.

Summary - The game is a confusing mess of disjointed ideas that don't work well together and aren't fun.

Pros:
- Art direction is pretty good.  Not amazing, but does what it needs to do.
- Unique premise.

Cons:
- Zero instructions or tutorial on anything.  The game just dumps you on a raft and asks you to figure out everything by trial and error.  I could never figure out how to use the research bench.  I might have been able to figure it out except for...
- Everything requires constant monitoring and clicking.  Everything requires constant refilling of resources.  You can't ever store much anywhere, so most of your time is spend gathering the resources and running in circles clicking on all your stations to refill them.  I barely had time to even look at the crafting menu because I was dying of hunger or thirst, the shark was taking a bite out of my raft, or the bird was eating my crops.
- Everything degrades with use.  Tools have to be re-crafted a lot.  It's another resource and time sink in a game that has too much of that already.  Again, I felt like I was only able to keep myself alive, much less get anywhere.
- Every item and station has a different interface.  Sometimes stations have hotpoints that you have to click on to do something.  Sometimes you have to have a particular item in your hand and then click, other times the game automatically takes something out of your inventory.  Why does the water purifier take planks out of my inventory to fuel it but doesn't take the cup of salt water unless it is in my hand?  Sometimes stations have a menu that opens, none of which are consistent or have any labels.  Buttons have no tooltips or indicators about why some are active and some are not.
- Items have no descriptions.  How much food does a raw potato vs. a cooked potato fill?  As far as I could tell, the difference was negligible, but I don't really have any idea.  Which kind of fish is bigger and better to cook?  No idea, since even the icon is only the fish head.  What kind of fluid is currently in my cup?  How long does something take to cook?  
- Why would I bother building walls or really anything other than a flat raft with stations randomly strewn across it?  What is the point of a bed?  Day and night don't seem to make any difference and there is no sunburn.  It doesn't get dark.  There is no weather.  I don't get tired.
- Why is the shark eating my raft?  I get attacking me when I get in the water, but sharks don't eat wood.  Is this trying to be Jaws?  It's a pretty small and unmotivated shark for that.  Taking out a square of my raft every five minutes is hardly really trying.  Doesn't it have anything better to do that follow my raft around forever?  Did I murder its family before the game started or something?"

14293,"This game is [b][u]NOT[/u][/b] balanced for single player. You lose 2/3 of your inventory every time you have to re-spawn, but you don't if you get revived. Guess what you can't do solo? Get revived. You're forced to re-spawn and lose inventory, and it can literally cripple you if you're low on resources and the 2/3 wipe eats your tools. It is BEYOND a stupid mechanic when you select single player and it was a clear oversight by the developers, or they intended solo players to experience extreme tedium mixed with unforgiving difficulty if you mess up."

14313,"cool game, uhh, i guess i like it a little bit."
14314,"TLDR : very slow paced survival game with massive downtimes between ''good'' parts


first of all,  Love Survival games , i grew up with them but this one is ..... Different 

It is a very chill game where you survive on water and expand your boat house base thing, and you need to have a lot of free time to enjoy it enough. it somehow feels like a mobile game but in first person and on PC with extra steps

It has no random events going around you to keep you hooked During those looong minutes on the water with your boat, no weather that messes you up , the waves do get big somtimes but it dosent damage your boat or fill it up to keep you busy to keep your base floating. No big monster attacking you out of no where. the only thing happening around you is the same shark following you 24/7 monching off parts of your boats and u have to chase him away with a shitty spear that takes 3 hits , so if you are late a few seconds he takes a chunk off your base no matter what.

outside of that , you just grab random crumbles of stuff floating on the water around you with a hook to craft some tools and decorations until you land on a minor island that might have 3 fruits and a tree. but from time to time you will find a little bigger island with 3 mobs on it , bird, boar wich are trying to kill you and a chill goat. there might be 1 chest on there that gives you metal parts and hinges. wich you will already have 15 of if u hooked the said crumbles on the water.

that was my experience for the 2 hours ive played it and if you are like me and a game dosent have a great start to make you hooked and dont have that much free time like i said earlier , i would suggest to look for another game with more survival mechanics than waiting around on your boat.
"
14315,it is good game about water
14316,This game was very cool you should try it

14336,"this gmae is awesome, very fun, and intriguing. my friend and i have spent a good 20 hours on the game completing it. and were very excited for the new chapter 3"
14337,Raft
14338,"So I woke up on this raft with no stuff, a hook, and a shark circling my raft waiting for my inevitable doom. I trawled scraps that I could out of the water to strap onto my raft and make a rudimentary fishing pole and cooking fire. The shark attacked, physically removing a chunk of my only means of safety before descending back into the icy depths below. I knew it was lurking, waiting for me to baste in the sun and get too tired to run. I cobbled together the debris I found into more raft to build myself a buffer between myself and a toothy demise.

Then I built a 2 story floating fortress.

The part with the alien spaceship is weird though.

Seven thumbs up

So the very last level of this game has a bunch of mario bros platformer bullshit for no reason whatsoever. It is glitchy as the collision doesn't work like any reasonable person would expect and infuriating in a not fun way.

The entire rest of the game has not has platformer crap. Why in the hell would you add it for 1.0?"

14351,"I've had this game from the start of early access and it's really become an amazingly fun survival game for me. Whether solo or with friends the game is challenging enough that I don't get bored, while also being fun, and allowing my to scavenge and build a wide range of neat weapons, tools, gear, and supplies. I'd highly recommend this game to anyone looking for a great survival game. Super fun to play with a friend."
14352,"Game is too repetitive in tasks for collecting goods without a clear mission goal. Then, you finish all of the main game material sooooo quickly, there is nothing else to do but wait for another game update. Islands are too far apart. Navigating without any star systems or gps that doesn't require hours of collecting goods and completing missions to find. Raft customizations and decor is superb, but is there a point to it? Does it enhance the game to have a raft that looks like a riverboat?? NO! Because it doesn't mean shit WHEN THERE IS NOTHING TO DO BECAUSE YOU BEAT THE GAME!!!!!!"

With no anti-cheat (as there is no competitive elements) and no micro-transactions, it just shows what quality gaming should look like. The game devs took long to complete the final chapter, but it was absolutely worth it. Definitely one of the best gaming experiences I've had in recent years."

Better yet, make Raft 2 in Unreal engine, not Unity. Unity is really holding games like these back, same happened with Subnautica - could be amazing, but engine limitations and difficulties only allowed for less than amazing game."

14447,"This game should not have left early access the way it is.

Feels very buggy and unpolished, and the core gameplay loop is made up from a handful of extremely tedious tasks, which other reviewers have detailed far more clearly than I feel like bothering to. Honestly, it makes it feel like you can't even relax for a second or leave the computer while your friend keeps playing.
On top of this the progression (not story but actual gameplay) is 100% limited behind grinding. No leveling, no talents, no perks, no exp, just endlessly collecting sea rubbish.

If you like in-depth complex gameplay and feeling like your skills are being challenged, this is not for you.

If you like building huge crazy ship cities, this is for you, but specifically in creative mode.

As far as gameplay depth goes I would equate this more to something like Farmville than other survival games like Rust, 7 Days To Die, Zomboid, The Forest, etc.

I would have found out I would not like this game if I had read some of the more detailed critical reviews, but I just saw ""overwhelmingly positive"" and clicked buy. I can only hope at least one person will see this and be saved $20 and can have a decent dinner instead."

You're on a tiny raft, collect trash from the ocean and build it out into a swimming paradise. There's many blueprints and ressources, as well as islands to visit. And of course there's your friend, THE SHARK, who is constantly out and about to take a little (or large) chomp out of you.

14514,"Dear Rafters from Steam, I am writing this review with an insane smile. The reason of my smiling is the oh so fast and strong Shark who keeps following me and my strong smelling scent that is coming right from under my arsehole. As I swam for my life, I sharted a strong smelling stream of diarrhea out of my arse. I quickly found out I had to be faster but I just couldn't keep up with his fast rotating sperm powered jizz fountaining penile destructer. As his penis rotated his way into my arsehole. As I cried while swimming to my boat knowing I couldn't comprehend the pain my arsehole was going through I stopped. I stopped swimming because I just couldn't take it anymore of the pain. I took my adrenaline and just snorted the liquid into my penis, instantly I didn't feel the pain anymore and I swam as fast as I could. Finally I arrived at my boat and just cried while the diarrhea farted out of my untightened arsehole. There I am, but I'll never be as tight as I used to be.... Overall great game I advice you guyz to buy the it. Beware of the shark...."
14515,good
14516,"This game is genuinely really fun!
It has an interesting story and enjoyable mechanics. If you love survival games you're going to love Raft!
Even though it lacks replay value it more than makes up for it by letting you free to do whatever you want.
The recent update adds hours more content to enjoy and makes you want to replay the entire game from the beginning. Can't recommend this game enough!

14524,"This game centers around a unique series of gameplay mechanics that seem so cool and unique at first but after a few hours you realize why this hasn't been attempted before. It is one of the most boring experiences I have ever had with a game even playing with friends wasn't enough to keep me from actually falling asleep at times. The game tries to keep you engaged by making your food and water meters deplete quickly so that you have to always be fishing, gathering materials, building, and repeating or die. It's a babysitting game with nice set dressing. I'd recommend trying it as it's clearly someone's game but if you don't like the gameplay experience of the first hour to two hours, don't bother playing it because the entire game is that gameplay experience."

This is one of my favorite games. It allows for as much or little creativity as you want, has an enjoyable resource management system, and storyline that keeps you exploring. I'd give it 5 stars for game play, 4 for some really annoying bugs midgame you wont notice unless you play offline. There's no internet available where I live and I've had to make a few special trips into town just to get past them. Far warning."

14587,"I've played a fair number of survival games, and my favorites, in general, are the ones that succeed in using a gimmick or hook to set them apart. Raft's gimmick is, of course, the raft lol, and despite initial doubts that a game primarily about surviving on a scrap boat could be interesting, I quite enjoy it so far. Raft conveys the feeling of being stranded at sea just well enough to lend credibility to the setting, learning to navigate your endless ocean drifting is an interesting experience, the shark is a d*ck, and anchoring off to salvage island materials is a great way to break up the monotony, with islands spawning just often enough to prevent actual monotony.

Good game. Haven't done co-op yet, but I can't imagine it wouldn't just get better with co-op."

14685,"UPDATED (6/28):

7/10. It's MOSTLY good. I've had mostly a very good time playing raft. I've played it A LOT. But there are some serious frustrations in the mix. Rare but serious. It's like eating a delicious cake that has a couple of rocks inside. It's 99% cake though!!! But when you bite into those rocks... it's easy to forget that for a moment. Know what I mean?

When it comes to the basic survival and raft gameplay, that's where most of the enjoyment is. It's nice floating around the ocean, fishing stuff out of the water, adding to your raft, stopping at islands to explore. This sense of building a better and better raft while exploring and adventure on the open sea is the part that's really fantastic. The story islands add a fun bit of extra exploration that reminds me a lot of finding the islands in Subnautica. It completely changes the experience and adds some excitement to the adventure. Not only that, but Raft does a good job of making every one of these story islands feel very different by giving each one it's own sorta gimmick or gameplay element. 

Here are my 6 basic demerits:

1) The game requires an internet connection to play. If your internet goes out, you can't play. Even if you're playing solo and aren't allowing other players to join. There is absolutely no reason why an internet connection should be needed in that case, but sorry, Raft doesn't understand the concept of single player, even though it purports to offer it, and insists on being an MMO whether it's necessary or not. More on this as we go down.

2) The combat really sucks. Usually this isn't an issue when it's simple fights like bears and rats, but there are fights in the game that are excruciatingly annoying. Partly what I mean by that is that the combat is just kind of janky. Enemies and their attacks clip through walls. Enemy attacks are either insanely telegraphed and slow and very easy to dodge or else not telegraphed at all and so unlikely to avoid that you might as well just tank the hit. But I also partly mean it's not balanced well for solo players in general. Certain enemies, and especially some boss encounters, seem to really assume there are at least two people--one to distract the enemy and another to do X while it's distracted. If you're a solo player... THAT PRESENTS KIND OF A PROBLEM. But there are other balance issues as well. If you're playing on Hard mode for example, you literally cannot revive unless you have a friend with you. At all. I remind you that this game purports to offer single player. 

3) Some of the puzzles in the story segments are incredibly tiresome. For the most part, the puzzling and problem solving is pretty good, but there are a few places (especially as you get toward the final chapters) where the puzzles are so boring (How would you like to just do math for 60 minutes? Does that sound fun? You're right. It's not.) or require you to waste so much time backtracking to find some number written on some wall somewhere ten minutes away that I wouldn't blame you for just looking up the solution to save yourself a lot of time.

4) The final chapter has a god awful platforming segment. Not only is astoundingly annoying, but they even make you do it twice just to be d**ks, I guess.

5) The rock-dropping birds are annoying bulls*** of the highest degree. The jankiness that allows them to drop rocks through ceilings or through water doesn't help. These birds need nerfed.

6) And this is my biggest complaint, which I've already touched on: They designed and balanced the game around the assumption that you would be playing it with friends. You CAN play this game solo, but it's one of those games where, when you play it solo, the game often reminds you that, yikes, actually, you're supposed to have a friend. Don't you have any? Big oof. 

So it's really mixed. The basic idea of raft is REALLY good and satisfying, and stopping on unique story islands to go on little side adventures IS a great addition. But... a lot of the above stuff is really annoying.

I loved the original prototype I played on Itch.io years ago (a single player experience I might add) so I couldn't wait to get in and play, and a lot of the best ideas are still in here. I still love rafting on the ocean, collecting materials with the hook, fighting off the shark, slowly turning a single square of dirty plywood into a luxury houseboat.

But now that they decided Raft is mostly for co-op players, the balance of the survival elements and the damage you take and various encounters are all just stacked against solo players. Especially if you're playing on Normal. It's POSSIBLE to do Normal mode as a solo player, but you're gonna have a real annoying time.

For example, even the survival elements on Normal mode assume two players. If there are two or more players, then you can divide tasks, right? One person steers and collects materials while another person cooks and forges, right? With that kind of teamwork, you can really stockpile A LOT of food. Which means that the hunger and thirst deplete at a rate that assumes you have a team, and therefore sufficient food, and therefore also enough time to do things other than just stand around cooking. On normal mode you need to eat two entire pigs and drink 10 gallons of water every five minutes. You just have to be inhaling food at every moment, like a kirby gif on loop. Can you do this solo? Yes. Technically. But it's tedious and sisyphean, and it just gets worse during segment when you have to leave the raft (and your food stores) for loooong stretches of time.


It really seems like Normal is balanced with the assumption that you have a friend with you that can split the tasks and the labor and the time investment and the damage spread and the everything. If you're a solo player and you're having trouble on ""Normal"", I would argue that the problem isn't that you're a p***y who can't handle ""Normal"". The problem is that raft assumes you are playing with multiple people and doesn't make that clear. ""Normal"" mode and higher is really ""co-op"" mode. It's annoying to put the game on Easy, but if you're playing solo and want to have an actually enjoyable experience, I would really recommend it. Some parts still aren't made for you and will be exceptionally annoying even on easy, but for the most part, you will actually be able to have an enjoyable time.

Like its original prototype, Raft is a wonderful and addicting concept. Adding an adventure to the mix just makes it that much more fun. A little bit of jankiness, some very annoying or tedious sections in some of the story beats, and being just kinda unfriendly to solo players, mechanically and rhetorically, spoils things a bit."
14686,"I've been playing this game for the past 3 years and enjoyed every inch of the game. Listing out very useful points to keep note if someone's a beginner.

SHARK (BRUCE) - Bad (Destroys foundation while we are out exploring)
Bear - Bad (He attacked me without me being aware)
Clucker - Good (Gives egg which helps with the boo-boo)
Goat - Good (Gives Milk which helps with hunger)
Llama - Very Good (Gives wool which helps in crafting leather)
Seagull - Bad (Hogs crops when we aren't there ;( . Good(They give drumsticks which are tasty))
Bee Swarm - Bad (They give boo-boo)
Lurker - Bad (pounce attack)
Screecher - Bad (Very aggressive and kill me when AFK -_-) Also there is a white Screecher xBewarex
Warthog - Bad (They charge and smash you)
Mudhog - Bad (Warthog's brother *-*)
Poison Puffer - Bad (They pollute the environment)

14694,raft
14695,"Fun. Can be played in a semi relaxed manor.  Food, thirst and shark attacks will keep you on your toes.  Wish the tools would not degrade as fast but it is somewhat manageable.  Crafting players will need to slowly build up in multiplayer so not to run out of resources for basic needs.  Cooking and building is a core mechanic in the game.  Some may wish there was an option on automating cooking.  I feel in single player its a distraction when traveling but in multiplayer it seems to be more of who can get stuck doing it nearly full time.
      Multiplayer is fun.  Forces more team building and game world is tied to a single raft.  So players cannot just split off and build their own.  So do not leave anyone behind when leaving an island because it will eventually disappear when the raft gets far enough.
      Puzzles and platforming are interesting.  Story beats are thought out.  One thing I would change is to have a larger starting platform for multiplayer.  Maybe a 4 x 4 square for eight players instead of the 2 x 2 square.
      (as of this review Game release 1.0 Update)   Shark respawn rate seems to be around two minutes in single player.   Seems to much faster in multiplayer for some reason."

As with most survival games, learning how to collect/process resources is a big learning curve and a big part of the ""progress"" felt, so I recommend you dont get carried through the game or you will miss the true sense of accomplishment."

Go nuts building your ""raft"".
"
14762,"Great game.

After watching Evan and Katelyn play this on YouTube I wanted to give it a try, knowing full well that I would play it different.
They play it in multiplayer coop as a team. Playing solo is my preferred way.

The thing that made it worth playing was the fact that it actually has a story!
I was expecting it to just be all crafting, but it is more than just that.

Here a tip:
if you lost your raft, such as by falling off it and watching as it sails off into the distance, or starve, or drawn, or get eaten by Bruce, just die and respawn.
Simple as that.
Your items are still in your inventory. I just kept on gathering materials until it was respawn time.
This for me made it less annoying than some games when you get killed, and meant I could just get back in and carry on."
14763,"wish there was more enemy variety, and they were less op with dodge frames, main thing I want is the ability to make new rafts that can dock on to your raft.  So I can anchor and then explore rather than coming close to land in a giant raft.

Stuck due to not being able to jump up or across to an area for the first blue location

Turns out i don't like the idea of a raft being your home, hate that the world isn't consistent and is constantly loading in, hate that the wind isn't dynamic.  Tired of games where resource management gets to the point you need like 10 furnaces, instead give us better versions of the machines if we need that resource still..."

14765,"I've finished the story.I bought this game in 2020,now has 2022,but I think the 68 yuan spent very worth!
There are still some bugs that need to be fixed.
This game gives me a different experience.
I also hope that the AXOLOT team will continue to work on Scrap Mechanic in the future.
I like the raft.

14774,when ever i try to start the game it continues to say missing executable no mater what i do and i cant contact the devs for help either.
14775,so good

14814,"A wonderful game that my wife and I enjoy playing together! It is fun, and on Easy it's the right amount of ""needy"" (water, food, etc) that it's fun while still providing a challenge! My wife enjoys nearly every part of this game, which is tough to say for many games! 10/10 recommend, for unos and duos, or more!"
14815,"This game is collecting Info on you!

I want to know what people are smoking if they think this game is relaxing. Maybe if you play creative.
The game gets much easier the more crap you collect, but at the start, prepare for frustration. 

No tutorial to ease you in. 
A whole lot of jank. Clipping issues are every where. Fell though the center of my raft on choppy waters.
Shark going through islands,rocks,etc. Lose your crap on death. Or better yet My Raft got stuck under and island for too long and I starved.... Oh and you go through food and water like you have a wasting disease.
The constant shark crap gets old with in minutes. Yeah I know about the darn bait. The only reprieve you get from this thing is to kill it. Or it gets stuck some where. Or kill it 20 times. Easy food, by the way. Every enemy is a chore. I can't enjoy this game even in the slightest.

This game just wastes your time.
No offline mode. That's nice, I can't pause. Got a phone call? Save Quit... Need to use the bathroom, Save and quit. 
Some one at the door? You got it. Save and freaking quit!!!

Great if you are plating with friends, They can watch over you.... But if you have a Life? This game is not designed with that in mind. If the Dev's Won't respect my time. I have none for them."

14825,Fix the game before you bring it out of early access. Game is still riddled with bugs and needs some serious improvement.
14826,"animals get lost all the time, even when fully boxed in by multiple layers of walls


rain is a physical nightmare, it rains through buildings, underwater and in all other places it should not.

food looks discusting, when you cook a meal, you get the head of the fish on the plate instead of the fish meat itself,   have the developers ever eaten food?
a drink with beetjuice gets half a beet on top of the glass,  have the developers ever eaten food?


titatnium tools are unlocked after the game is finished? whats even the point?

so, after utopia, what now?


i did not rush that much, made a big multilayer ship, and still only an 22 hour game.

14839,"While I am happy that the devs fixed the inability to play offline, I still question why their game may have 'bugs' for playing offline.

Barring that, I will say this is one of the best survival games out there;  The upgrades you get for following the main story are paced well, and there's plenty of time you can spend just idly going from island to island."

14871,"I enjoy world building. Valheim has been my game of choice for about a year now, and recently my friends suggested I try Raft. I love the options to play on many different levels so I can ease myself into more complex situations and can kind of grow with the game. Playing with friends is a lot of fun, and playing solo on Peaceful is incredibly relaxing.

Today has been a DAY, but thanks to a couple hours on my Raft, I had the energy to get through it, clean my kitchen, make a delicious dinner, and pour love and attention back into  my family.

As a side note, I have incredible anxiety around water. I can't swim and just the idea of drowning or a shark (or anything, honestly) in the water is terrifying to me. I thought for sure I'd have to stop playing right away, but instead I'm finding myself getting more comfortable each time I play."
14872,Nothing beats kamikazeing Bruce every time he passes nearby the boat
14873,yes
14874,"This game is definitely one of the best ocean survival games I have ever played.
It is the perfect mix between all of my favourite genres.

I love this game so much, and I think anyone could enjoy this too."
14875,.
14876,your on a raft
14877,"I downloaded this game a while back and have tracked the progression of what seemed to be a very promising game. I enjoy the relaxing nature of most of the gameplay with the odd bits of spice thrown in from the in game hazards. The exploration is good and the random islands is a good touch, keeps things fresh. Overall, I have always enjoyed this game as its very enjoyable.

HOWEVER; with the release of 1.0, the devs have made the confusing decision to force online only play with no offline mode available. 

Update; Hotfix 1.3 added offline capability again. Therefore; I'm happy to wholeheartedly recommend this game."
14878,I constantly enjoy this game. a thing i would suggest though is the ability to move the inventory so i could read the description of items when the crafting menu is in the way.
14879,i'm a pirate
14880,Lots and lots of organizing and exploring. Therapeutic music and environmental atmospheric feeling. Very well made and fun to play! I appreciate that the graphics don't need to be on a different level in order to experience a fun world and story.

The choice to play without enemies (well, without enemies that attack) is fantastic and lets you play this as just a cozy exploration sim. Very relaxing soundtrack and the exploration is top tier. Crafting isn't complicated and there are a ton of things to find."

14906,"It's insanely grindy. Possibly the most tedious such game. But it lacks the flexibility and options the other games have. The hunger/thirst rate is INSANE, The amount of ressources you gain and need together with the  incredibly tedious individual processing (grill, smelter, water) and the tool durabiity on top make this a absolute micromanagement busywork smulator. 

And it's either that or plain creative mode. Still no custom difficulty/grind sliders like Ark and others similar games.  With a few mods  fixing the balance and de-tediuousifying the gameplay somewhat, without having to use plain creative mode, the game is then more playable (i.e. somewhat less grindy) . 
The actual game is quite cool, looks very good and runs well.

Mods:""stat modifier""(hunger/thirst), ""hand gathering"" (quick no-hook pickup under water) and ""full-recycling""(dismantle=all ressources back).

Btw i'm not sure how to feel about the automatic shops all over the big islands now. It's convenient against the above issues but also feels kinda  out of place and maybe ruins the whole post apocalypse loneliness vibe of the game.   They are convenient but make no sense in the setting."
14907,good game
14908,This game was the best 9 hours for the final part. The game has been the best than any other crafting game so far. Sad that this is the last chapter of the game hopefully they will make a number two. Only thing I wish we had was a repair bench instead of using materials over and over again. The game was great from start to finish. Thank you to all of the developers who took the time to make a great game!

14914,"There is no tutorial so you are completely lost in the game. Boat was stuck against an island, died of thirst...these are just a few of the simplest things to die from because there is no tutorial of any kind."
14915,It's fairly well designed. The game loop is fun and we are at our 5th world already.
14916,I love the physics and the gameplay about this game but latley after i got the latest 1.0 update for the ending it wont load at all like i can open it and choose the world i wanna go into but it doesnt ever load and eventually the screen just goes black and it slows my computer down alot
14917,e
14918,"Muito bom, só achei o jogo meio pesado, poderia ser um pouco mais otimizado. Fora isso, as mecânicas são muito boas e é legal de jogar"

Also notable: 
You can shove any edible thing you find on your adventures into yourself without getting morbidly obese (#jealous)."

14949,fun game yes :)
14950,"Buyer beware! There Is NO good reason for this game to be always online, Especially when THEY themselves said it would NOT need an online connection to play! The only reasons I can think a company like this would make their game always online is to harvest your data, and sell it to skim some more profits off the top, and doing so with the 1.0 launch screams ""I'm taking the money, and running"". DON'T BUY THIS GAME! It IS malware that will drain your data, and if you are in a country with a limit on how much data you can stream a month (like I am) it makes it impossible to keep the game running without worrying that you will run out your data limit while playing! I LOVED playing this game while it was in early access as it was a beautiful world with fun game mechanics, and an interesting story, but now that they have pulled this I can NEVER trust this publisher or developer again. Buyer Beware."
14951,If you like multiplayer with your friends and a good time of silly antics. This game is definitely it. Might have little bugs here and there but i personally haven't really had any. Game Dev's are GREAT and this game is a must try 10/10.

14970,"Do you think games like Ark and Rust are too grindy? You will spend longer gathering the supplies for making an item in this game, then the time you use said item.  I think this is to pad out the playtime because it is so boring and empty. Buy this game on sale, do not pay full price because this is just a shell of a game even with 1.0 out."
14971,"Game is pretty meh, It feels like a bare-bones version of the forest. If you like exploration and intense situations this game is not for you. If you like spending 15 minutes while waiting to drift to an island for some sand then consider this game. It gets more fun with friends but still felt like it lacked the initial motivation to play. Building can be a little fun but resource collection is extremely boring as you just wait and throw a hook at each individual copy pasted log that drifts by and eventually get a couple of nets set up so you can afk waiting for the same 6 islands to gather some required items for the story.

tl;dr The game feels boring, has a lackluster story, and the gameplay does not make up for it. Does not feel high quality in any way."

Thank you Redbeet Interactive, love you guys, gals and whom/whatever else you have in your team =)"
14979,this game is fun and if you really loved the movie cast away like me then this is a really fun game with all the islands and adventures and little secrets

14981,"I  have changed this review from negative to positive.

The developers have reinstated offline play, with a warning that you are offline and there may be problems / bugs because of this.

Now it means you should still be able to play Raft on your way to work, or without an internet connection elsewhere.
 

Glad the devs are listening. More power to them."

14998,"As a basebuilder and exploration game, it is fine. As a survival game, it fails on step one. The goal in any survival game essentially comes down to bar management, you try your best to keep all bars high, and sometimes have to sacrifice some of one bar to fill the other. The motivation to explore, build and take risks, comes in the pursuit of keeping those bars filled. However, this game offers many easy, quickly granted and replicable ways of keeping those bars filed indefinitely. With little to no challenge in keeping those methods up. As a result, you do not feel adequately compelled to pursue opportunities or improve your station, and consequently, to continue playing.

TLDR: Too easy to survive. Felt no need to expand or explore."

15001,its amazing
15002,"A fun survival game with an actual story! *gasp*

I have been playing this with two friends and we all feel like they have nailed the resource management side of things. You are always looking over how much food/water/crafting materials you have to survive and progress. Add a well told story through notes you find and environmental storytelling and this title rises above alot of other survival games in my opinion. 

Also, that fucking shark. <3"
15003,"The game at its core is fun but the animals are the glitchiest possible creatures ever. Sharks clip through land, bores scale up rocks and teleport at you, and the birds overhead dropping rocks on your head are impossible to dodge. god forbid if you get your raft stuck on one micro meter of island terrain and all your hard work is thrown out the window"
15004,"I am in love with Raft. Though sometimes a bit unclear, once you get the hang of the story you get sucked in. Me and my boyfriend love playing it, him working on the survival on the raft and fighting the shark and me continuing the story and scouring the islands. I would not recommend the game for single player, but that's simply because it's so much fun doing it together."

Fortnite Battle Royale sets itself apart by trading the traditional, bland military simulation vibe with vivid colors and an outstanding, freeform building system that’s unlike anything else in competitive multiplayer games.As its name suggests, Fortnite Battle Royale fits so neatly into the battle royale genre that blew up last year that the basic description sounds as standard as you can get: Up to 100 players are dropped onto a large but constantly shrinking map with the goal of gathering weapons and gear to become the last person or team left standing. But if you look just a little closer, it can’t be mistaken for any other game because the vehicle you’re skydiving out of is, inexplicably, a flying party bus – a nice change of pace from a drab military plane – and the place you land is a giant, beautifully colorful island, instead of a realistic landscape, surrounded by a violent storm.
Thankfully, unlike other battle royale games, like PlayerUnknown’s Battlegrounds, where an unlucky circle could leave getting out of the encroaching circle almost impossible, Fortnite’s map is at least small enough (relative to PUBG’s) that even if you have to run across the entire island to get to the safety of the randomly centered eye of the storm you run very little risk of being killed by the collapsing border.
On the island are several large and totally unique cities, each with their own style of structures — a quaint suburb of houses, a giant office district filled with skyscrapers, or a retail area with an outdoor mall. Each city is full of vibrant colors, and the map as a whole has hundreds of buildings with randomly spawning loot in the form of guns, explosives, and healing items.
Wait, Which Fortnite Is This? Developed by Epic Games, Fortnite was originally conceived as a third-person, co-op, survival game where teams of players could mine resources and build structures to hold off hordes of undead enemies. That version, now a standalone game called Fortnite
Fortnite Battle Royale’s inventory management is, thankfully, simple by design. You get just five slots, so you’re forced to balance your arsenal of guns with your need for healing or explosives to deal with enemy structures. It’s a neat limiting factor that forced me to keep a mental shopping list of exactly what I was on the lookout for as I ran across the island, and to resist the urge to pick up anything else. With such specific needs in mind, every chest came with the thrill of hoping it would reveal the weapons I wanted most. Fortnite gives you plenty of ways to mix and match weapons, so even if that chest doesn’t come up with the exact item you want, you’ll never feel powerless in a fight.
Once you do find the weapons you’re looking for, most fights in Fortnite go about the same way: You start with one shot from a slow-firing heavy weapon like a sniper rifle or pump shotgun in hopes of ending the fight before it really started, then (if needed) switch over to a faster assault rifle or tactical shotgun to carry out the rest of the battle. While it’s far from the only way to play, this combination seems to be the preferred method for almost every player and provides the foundation of almost every fight in Fortnite.
It’s a chaotic and fun system that makes fights a little more complicated.
It’s a lightning-fast system where fights can end in the blink of an eye with just one slight miss. This makes for a stark contrast from other battle royale games like PlayerUnknown’s Battlegrounds, which is filled with long, tense standoffs where sustained accuracy often matters more than a single well placed shot. It’s a chaotic and fun system that makes fights a little more complicated than simply aiming at your opponent and firing, but after a few hours with Fortnite I started to get the shoot-and-switch rhythm down and fights started to become almost automatic.
It’s the stuff around the shooting that helps Fortnite differentiate itself from every other battle royale game and shows off what truly makes it special: The building.
Carrying over the building system from Save the World is a brilliant choice that sets Battle Royale apart not just from other battle royale games, but most competitive multiplayer games in general. Just about everything that isn’t the ground can be mined for wood, stone, or steel, which can be used to create walls, stairs, and floors anywhere on the map (so long as some part of the structure touches the ground). It’s a massive system with so many possibilities that, at first blush, it can be daunting to try to figure out how to build the massive structures that others around you have created. But that’s one of the best things about Fortnite: It always keeps things simple.
That’s one of the best things about Fortnite: It always keeps things simple.
With just three primary tiles – floors, walls, and stairs – the building toolset may seem limited, but it’s got everything you really need. Whether it was building a staircase up to that hard-to-reach loot chest or quickly laying down an impromptu piece of cover to protect from an attacking enemy, I found I always had the tools I needed for the job at hand, and I could swap to the piece I needed without missing a beat. In fact, that swapping is so easy that one of my favorite moves is placing one platform and jumping off of it, then switch to another type in mid-air and place it before I land. That trick allows you to scale vertical walls or go straight up a mountain. While this may sound like an impressive feat of dexterity, Fortnite makes it so simple that almost anyone can pull it off – and they do, making it one of the most common tricks to getting around the island.
The first time I really understood how Fortnite’s building and shooting played into one another came in the middle of a fight in Retail Row, one of the map’s many cities. Another player and I were sheepishly taking shots at one another from behind single walls we had built. After I ran out of ammo in my assault rifle, I was forced to turn to my shotgun – a weapon I had largely disregarded up until this point. With the few resources I had left, I built stairs over my opponent’s wall, jumped off, flipped around, and shotgunned him. Looking back, it was as routine a play as it gets, but it was an absolute revelation for me at the time. Suddenly, everything made sense, and I realized that Fortnite Battle Royale is more about building than it is about shooting.
While the little things you can use it for may seem obvious – like building stairs to get to the roof of a building, or making a wall to block an enemy’s shots – the system also gives you room to think outside the box. You could build around a downed teammate that you can’t help yet, or create a decoy fort to lure enemies into an ambush while you wait behind a tree. The system even provides some elegant solutions to getting caught outside the trademark random circles of the battle royale genre: If you find yourself on the wrong side of a lake or chasm, no problem – just make your own bridge to the other side.
One player lured me into his elaborate fortress of hallways in hopes of forcing me toward his waiting shotgun at the end of the maze.
Thanks to the building system’s simple but robust design, you can throw structures together in a way that suits your style. While some people love high towers that stretch into the sky, I like to keep things at a lower altitude, giving me more room to bounce between my platforms and the ground. One player I faced lured me into his elaborate fortress of hallways, with doors that led to nothing, all in hopes of forcing me toward his waiting shotgun at the end of the maze.

15094,"I've played through this game several times now, and am very excited for the final chapter. I can't recommend it enough. It's a very chill, stress free game. Unless you play on hard, then Bruce is a total jerk."
15095,Excellente!
15096,"This has to be on of the best survival games I have ever played! It's a shame that it isn't that well known. I haven't even started the story yet and I already love the game. For the price of the game, the speed at which it runs and how well bug fixes are rolled out as well as a lot of content it's extraordinary!

The only thing I would say about the game is that it does require you to take some time to learn the basics of the game and how to retain your water and food levels. It can be tricky at first but if you continue on past that point you can really build some amazing things. The discord is also a great place to ask questions which I'm sure you'll have to ask at some point. https://discord.gg/raft  

Overall it is an amazing game I would recommend this to anyone of any age!"
15097,"I very much enjoy this game! A genuinely nice survival game with a surprisingly good, and dark, story! The game is playable alone but is even more fun with friends, you can also find mates to play with in the official discord server!"
15098,yes

15108,best game
15109,ddA
15110,Raft is a very fun game! I've had it since it released on steam (literally the exact day) and it's always been a great game. Definitely recommend it!
15111,"I LOVE EVERYHTING
"
15112,Awesome Gane
15113,Great game about rafts.
15114,Great game
15115,"Damn the wait for the final chapter was definitely worth it. honestly my favorite game of the past few years to come out. 10/10 well done devs.

that aside the only time i find myself being bored with this game is very early in the beginning. At this stage if you know what you are doing its just a waiting game for resources. BUT if you are new to the game the slow pace and limited tools make it an intuitive sort of tutorial that feels wonderful to work your way through.

The insane amount of time you spend in the word exploring all of the islands and building/expanding your raft always feels like a breeze."
15116,"Learn how to build a hook, use it to fish planks, use the planks to distill water and build a fishing rod from them, use the fishing rod to catch fish, cook the fish using your planks, need more planks, fish more planks, drink more water, eat more food cooked by using planks, fish more planks, learn to build an axe from planks, use it to chop trees to get more planks, use the planks to cook more fish, fish more planks to repair your axe, all while your raft will be attacked by sharks which you can fend off by building a spear - from planks - then repairing the damaged sections - with planks - after that you will have time to fish more planks.

If raft taught me anything, it is that planks are life, not water. The world is indeed fueled by planks, so you better start fishing or you might end up as sharkbait.

10/10, would spend hours fishing for planks again"
15117,NERF SCREECHERS
15118,Build Raft. Shark breaks Raft. Kill Shark. Repair Raft. Discover island. Loot resources from Island. Find even more stuff underwater. POGGERS. Unbeknownst to you the Shark respawned. Have heart attack as Shark punks you. Kill shark. Also fuck them seagulls. Game is dope. Wasting an ungodly amount of resources reinforcing your raft foundation has caused me great pain. I'd do it again in a heartbeat.
15119,You want a game to relax with after a day of work? This is for you !
15120,nevim ale csko je lepse
15121,uhhh i like the uhhh fish
15122,absolutely amazing. no other words.
15123,"amazing game, especially with friends"
15124,"One of the few Chill Games what you can play here and there
Most fun is Building up your Raft with all the Stuff you can Explore"
15125,this game is absolutely fun when playing with friends. game is very fun
15126,One of the most boring survival crafting games I've had the non-enjoyment of playing.
15127,"isnt dicks, its tits"
15128,It's finally complete and it's awesome!
15129,One of my favorite games of all time. Love to play it alone or with friend. If you're into exploration resource games you are probably gonna like this.  <3
15130,"its so fun to play with friends

15131,a very good game try it!!
15132,fish
15133,"This game is mind blowing good fun with friends - not so much solo... You get lonely haha

Game has a great way of constantly adding new stuff to strive towards so you never end up in a situation where you feel like nothing is a challenge and there is nothing to do. The concept is incredible!!!

If you like survival, exploring and building - BUY BUY BUY!"
15134,DEAD BY DAYLIGHT REFERENCE???
15135,Your friendships will be tested when someone forgets to refill the purifier with sea water but will ultimately emerge stronger as you bond over your common hatred of sharks
15136,Lots and lots of water. +you get a shark hat when you kill it; chicken nuggets aswell

15143,thats nice multiplayer game next to the rust
15144,"shork

15145,Its such a fun game with friends and i recommend it to everyone that thinks their board
15146,"This is one of the best games ever, I started playing Raft in the early beta, before it was even launched on steam. Since then, it evolved into something much bigger and better than it even was before.

The Final Chapter is like the cherry on the cake. It rounds everything up and makes it the perfect game to play with friends.
"
15147,good game during the 2022 gaming drought
15148,Raft is a great game even if all of its potential was never fully realized. A beautiful world and engaging game play packaged with a story that is neither as engaging nor interesting. If a good survival builder game is what you are looking for then Raft is worth every penny. Very much looking forward to what Redbeet has in store for us next!
15149,Can catch a llama and call it Llama Del Rey. 10/10 game
15150,I love this game it is such a realistic game it is one of my most favorite games of all time
15151,"no tutorial, repetitive gameplay"
15152,raft is a SUPER FUN GAME BTW but i think it should cost like £18 but 20 is fine but good game
15153,"just a game which you can play until you die in real life. AWESOME gameplay, and with friends too, if you have any"
15154,"Take this no with a grain of salt. This game has a lot to offer and is generally enjoyable. Unfortunately the 1.0 release is nowhere near a full and complete game. In fact I would argue that the 1.0 release is WORSE than the early access. Shark teleports all over the place, objects glitch and fly, inventory management is still abysmal, the UI in general is just awful, and the ""hard mode"" is not actually hard... instead this game fell into the ""more hp baddies = hard"" trap. Some have complained about food and water in hard (understandable) but personally I hate more HP baddies. This does not change any actual difficulty; instead, this just makes the game more annoying. To make a game hard, one should add challenging factors, like say... fall damage? This would force the player to rethink how they originally played or built. making baddies have more hp means you stab more. Nothing actually changes.
I was really hoping to give this a solid thumbs up, but what we have here is someone who got bored over a year ago, got tired of reading suggestions, slapped the rest together and called it quits. 

Maybe wait for a sale or something."
15155,Just like all the other survival games this also suffers from grind and waiting also character gets hungry too quickly
15156,so much fun with other players

15182,"I am a 45 yo father, probably one of the oldest people playing this game. I am a single farther to my Son, who is 14 now. My son got this game for Christmas from his uncle, so we installed it on his computer and he started playing. By the end of the week he had 24 hours on this game. This was horrible for me, as it was already hard for me to find ways to spend time with my son, as he is always out with his friends or just, watching YouTube. So i decided to make a Steam account and get this game to see if I could maybe play alongside him. loaded into the game, made my character and world and started playing but I was stuck on what you where supposed to do. I asked my Son for help and he hosted a game for me to join. loved it as it was the best time had spent with my Son since my wife had died. This game has ever since brought me and my son closer again and now we actually spend time together outside the house together as well. This game reminded me that there's fun to be had in everything, and it has brought both me and my Son many happy memories."

"
15211,"fun but dam my pc dont like it

15212,bem bom
15213,"Fun to be had both solo and co-op but co-op is the best way to experience the game. There's a story to be explored as you progress and unlocking more items will get you further into that story.

In a nutshell you start on a small raft, build it to become a bigger raft. Add things to your raft to make eating and sleeping easier, and beat the crap out of that pesky shark to survive."
15214,"Great Game.. devs put honest work into the game. The honest work translates to ingame, as absolute dawgshit. literal garage game. bland environment. Nothing new with the bosses/enemies. same boss combo. I would recommend this game to certified retards which is mainly the steam community."
15215,I wish more game studios made game like this to chill with friends.
15216,Its so funny game
15217,highly addictive and fun to play co op
15218,Fun especially with friends
15219,I have killed the entirety of Bruce's family at least 7 times.
15220,Fun multiplayer with friends and a good challenge as single player
15221,"I keep coming back to play this game because it is relaxing, exciting, challenging and stimulating. It has a good story and great for solo play. I haven't much ventured into online play but it does have a fun coop.
Honestly one of the best games I have ever played. Sometimes it's great to come back to it and just cruise around on your raft!"
15222,"gud:)

15223,This looks like a good game but due to health problems i have not been able to play it much due to no native controller support.
15224,鲨鱼就算了，还有轰炸鸡。普通难度太难
15225,"raf
"
15226,"So raft is this game where you survive on a raft, and do things on a raft. the entire game is on a raft, besides the parts that are not on a raft. Overall, raft is a rafting game about rafts, and its a very good rafting game about rafts. I would highly recommend this game about rafts. Raft/10"
15227,"Didn't click for me. The fact that your raft is the center of gameplay area and if you lose your raft you're effectively perma-dead (can't build another one) seems very lazy. It would be entirely logical to be able to build another one if you're on an island, have the necessary tools and necessary materials. How did you build the initial raft in the first place? It’s lazy development, centering the play area around the initial raft and not being able to build another one. Many games have this mechanic implemented correctly.

Yeah, the game is called Raft and most stuff should revolve around it, I’m not arguing against it, but that’s not the point. Point is that you shouldn’t take unrealistic and illogical shortcuts to make the development easier.

And it’s not only that, there’s the mechanic that you collect most important materials only by drifting through the ocean and collecting stuff… what kind of an ocean is that in which every 5 seconds there’s a barrel to hook in, plastics everywhere, wood, leaves… it’s like an aftermath of a tsunami. You’re actually safer on the raft because in the open ocean you have all the necessary materials to survive, but when you’re exploring an island, you are actually less safe cause there’s no crucial materials needed to make tools, purifiers, cups, etc.

Then there’s – to avoid being bitten by a shark you jump (??) out of the water? And the shark only follows the raft, not you, and it instantly teleports to bite you the second you drop into the water. Seagulls penetrate closed rooms to get to your plants. Birds on an island throw rocks at you and kill you if you stay long enough?

It all seems very unrealistic. I know it’s a small 3-man development team so you can’t expect miracles, but this is too much for a positive review."

15251,"A game with brilliant mechanics that tests your wits and teaches you to prioritize what is necessary and things that keep you from getting where you need to go. It's captivating storyline is engaging and thrilling and leaves you questioning and wanting for more, yet it has an uncanny ability to bring out all manner of emotions within you, peace, calm, serenity, gratitude, fear, panic and even sadness. Definitely one of the gems amongst recent game releases and worth a playthrough."

15263,"I've been playing raft for around 4 years and still haven't stopped, imo I love raft, though some get bored after completing all the islands, I don't, I drift around and look around for places, searching for resources and getting new pets. This game is so pretty and relaxing, except for when that motherless, fatherless, friendless, unlikable shark comes over and bites your raft, I actually called him that when I was playing with my friend, the next day a bunch of whales/turtles/dolphins and etc came over to the shark for the first time, I was proven wrong I suppose.. I'm mainly only typing this because I'm waiting for it to update so I can play chapter 3, and because I love raft. It's currently at 1.27GB out of 1.36GB!! I'm gonna go eat some cheese, you should play raft."

15268,I love this game so much that I forgot to review it!  It's here the final part to the story and I can't wait to play it.  It's been a long journey building many rafts and swimming with Bruce my best and tasty buddy.  I find it relaxing and enjoy building from early stages of my raft to when I have just about everything I need on it.  It's definitely a game I would recommend to anyone that wants to lose themselves for a while on the sea.

15271,"One of my favorite survival games, and a great way to relax. Has a great building system if that's your thing. It also comes with complementary Bruce, so 10/10 game, would recommend for anyone."
15272,"look, this game is pretty rad, okay? It's chill. You get a bunch of friends, you pick up a bunch of flotsam and jetsam, you solve some mysteries and you poke at some sharks, and it's a good time. You'll like it, I promise."

15278,"Fun alone , but better with others"
15279,"Redbeet Interactive's debut game is a decently balanced survival game with straightforward co-op. The graphics are a bit primitive, but the gameplay loops are well refined: collect, defend, craft, eat, explore, expand, and adventure. The music is pleasant, but short, and the art style is pleasant but somewhat basic. 

There are sharks that will constantly force a player threat, so be prepared to defend yourself from shark attack frequently. Once however you reinforce your raft edge with steel, this looming doom mechanic is overcome. With that out of the way you can really start trekking out to islands and dealing with eagle and boar attacks. 

Overall a delight to play and fun to pick back up once in a while."
15280,"No :(

Unsatisfactory gameplay, storyline, rewards, and ending.

15282,this game sucks
15283,Amazingly atmospheric and addictive.
15284,good gaem
15285,very nice
15286,its a good game to play with friends and its really relaxing at times wouldnt recommend to people who are afraid of the sea or sharks lol
15287,One of the best early access games I've ever played. Also some of the most fun I've had with friends. Something about a multiplayer game that forces you all to live and work together on a tiny space makes for some great moments.
15288,it is cool
15289,not that interesting
15290,"I wanted to wait until the full version of the game was out before I reviewed it, and I'm happy I did! If you're into crafting games then Raft is fine enough, but the game really shines when you have a bunch of buddies working on the same raft! As of this final major update, the game has become pretty nice to look at, too. Plenty of flora and fauna under the sea to keep me impressed, even if a lot of the islands feel kind of same-y after maybe 2 hours spent in game. If you have some buddies who already have this game, or if you and the squad can all pick it up, then this game really shines."
15291,This game is very good
15292,I put an anchor down every time i went onto an island and my raft disappears.... this happened 3 times... I gave the game 3 chances and it failed... 8 hours of my day gone... what a fun mechanic... so realistic... the game is a wast of time still. Do not bother buying it. Version 1.0 means nothing. The game is still broken.

15295,"Now that Chapter 3 is finally out I guess it's time for a review. Game is great with friends, just don't plan for building a giant mansion or whatever or else it will be too addicting since everything is really pretty and if you aren't the host you'll be waiting for your friend to wake up and open the world since it's servers are hosted client side. Also Bruce loves to eat your ass so much you'll soon realise surviving is the least of your worries."

I've watched it grow every release. Seen them take player feedback to heart, and still keep their creativity going.
They've worked hard over the years, and it shows. 

This game is amazing. 

Whether you are playing solo, or with friends, you are in for an immersive experience with much to see and do.

Everything about this game feels great. The control, the environments, the constructing, combat, everything. I cannot think of anything that feels off in this game. 

I highly recommend getting this game. Now or at any time.
These amazing devs not only worked hard on this game for years, but they also lowered the price for a sale on release.
Get it! Get it now!"

15333,My friend bought this for me and another buddy to play. The three of us were super hyped. One day me and the third (the one that didn't buy me the game) played it for hours and hours. We ended up accidentally getting to the end at that time (this was before final chapter came out). Overall it's a good game and very addicting. 10/10 Def would bring a friend.

Peaceful story mode is great for playing with young kids who are just learning to play games, while normal is just hard enough for the slightly older crowd. Hard is a real challenge meant for those that have mastered survival on an unrelenting sea."

Overall fantastic game to play with friends, and 12/10 would recommend."

I haven't started a new game in quite awhile but it was really challenging to get off to a good start - but once you get established a bit and start developing your raft and gear, it really becomes fun to explore the world.

Now that they released the final update to get to version 1.0 - I really hope they still create some more updates or offer some additional DLC for it."

15372,"I enjoy the game-play. I enjoy focusing on making my raft better and better while finding out more about the individual parts of the world. It's fun to play with keep items on because it makes the shark much less scary. I'm not much of a hardcore gamer since I dislike being frustrated, so it's nice that the game has that option to make it a bit more casual for me."

It's been a long journey.
Great 1.0 update. lots of new stuff, especially the new rafter.

For a basic survival-crafting game, this is a great game to enjoy casually by yourself or with friends.
For people who seek challenge, there is almost no challenge in this game. so be warned.

Would be super great if they can implement dedicated server."
15402,goated game new update never thought it would happen now its making me cream my pants
15403,Fun game that twists the base-building theme by having the world literally revolve around your raft
15404,"Been sailing the seas for days now...... my only friend is the shark that keeps eating my raft every so often, hoping to make it to the other side one day soon! if my friend doesn't eat me first that is !!"
15405,Very chill game with friends especially. The game doesn't rush you to do any story mission islands or to engage with the story at all. The story is a very nice touch and keep you interested and to want to explore more. In my opinion a very nice game to own if you like survival games and has a big plus if you have the friends to play with. Recommend 10/10

15428,Honestly a very solid game. The story isnt terribly long but if you have friends it can be a lot of fun. playing alone isnt terrible but its a lot more fun with people.
15429,This game is trash until they add controller support. don't buy it until they do.

15458,"Calming (unless Bruce is targeting you every second), beautiful, self-paced game. Been waiting for the new update for awhile now and so glad I did. Haven't played it solo, only with two other people and there are plenty of things to do. Beware of Bruce, he will not leave you alone. Also, parkour."

15469,"Great game, never had any story progress, but had a cool base. so 11/10

1.0 update is tempting me, time to add some hours back into the game"
15470,This game has amazing graphics and an amazing story line. The fun doesnt end when the story does and allows you to mess around and have fun with it if you would like.
15471,"This game is pretty great, if you like the ocean, survival, games, and sharks, and dating this game is for you. It is a harrowing tale of a VERY persistent shark that is desperately trying to get with you but comes off as pushy from time to time. Enjoy beautiful reefs, an massive open world, and all the awkward sea life sexual advances you can stand. 10/10 would play again."
15472,"1.0 has caused a perpetual ""Disk Write Error"""

15476,Eh
15477,yes
15478,"I love this game and i recommend this for people who like sandbox survival and for people who love to build and create with the only limit being resources and your own imagination. I know, it sounds cringy but its true. I'm so excited for this new update because it adds so much more to the game and depth to the exploration. But, I started tearing up for real when i saw this new update because this game has so much meaning to me no matter how many hours i have on this game its near and dear to my heart. I will tear up every time i see someone bring this finale."
15479,hahahahahaha
15480,me like the funne shark
15481,FUCKING GREAT WHITE SHARK!!!!!!
15482,"I will never forget the experiences my friends and I had playing this game. We started a raft during the pandemic and it really helped us forget about the chaos going on in the real world, because we had so much going on in the game. 

We had 6 people load up to a new server for the first time, and having all of us on a 2x2 square in the middle of an apocalyptic ocean was priceless. 

The game starts off with survival challenges, but towards the mid game, it becomes more about the story that the game is trying to tell as you design and build a raft with your friends. Resource needs are fairly forgiving in this game, you can go about your own pace without fear of unavoidable failure. Almost every problem presented at the beginning of the game can be solved by the mid game within the crafting tree, and by late game your once 2x2 square becomes a seafaring vessel that rappers wish they could shoot a video on. Or just a jumbled mess of all your friends' stuff shoved in different coolers. 

14/10 highly recommend to all"
15483,"genuinely phenomenal game, not too much grind, yet it gives you enough things to do to keep you interested."
15484,is fun
15485,good
15486,"amazing game overall, havent played the latest update but am extremely excited to see what was added. thank you devs for creating such an amazing game. props goes out to you.

15500,"Very fun game,  Great with friends or solo.  Difficulty settings make it enjoyable for all ages/play types.  Late /end game (as of part 2) is like a more challenging Minecraft.  Part 3 is upcoming.  Devs for this game are super involved with the community and have patched and added things pretty regularly."

15511,Finally the last chapter
15512,"Fun, Bruce is awesome, rough to start off but after that the possibilities are quite nice. Still feels like room for more if they cared to as if you plow the story just right it's not hugely long."

15534,"Me and my boyfriend play this game together, it's an amazing co-op, survival game that hits a really nice balance between the needs and actual gameplay. With so many customization options for building your raft, not to mention a very well done story told through the world/environment and notes you find along the way. Would recommend this to any couple or some friends looking for a fun game to play together."
15535,"One of my favorite survival crafting games! It's very chill and calming, and the gathering is very cathartic."

15546,its ok with friends but kinda boring by yourself
15547,"Meh. Game is like a 4/10, only got it because a 'friend' begged me too. Yet when I suggest games to him he won't get them. Now that this 1.0 update came out (finally lol) he's asking to play it again, guess what my answer is going to be? It's a 2 way street, I scratch your back you scratch mine. Won't be playing the game again regardless of the new update, solo or duo with a 'friend'"
15548,"Cool game, HOWEVER it is nearly impossible to go through a chapter without watching a video, and if you dont watch a video your look at like 3-7 hours on one mission. W game L story (for the time it takes for a simple thing)"
15549,"God tier game, go play it."
15550,very good
15551,such a fun game

15555,"Such an amazing concept come to life! One of my all time favorites and such beautiful zen moments that help a old guy like me find some peace. Raft blows other survival craft games out of the water! ok that was bad, but seriously, play this game its super fun and a great sandbox :)"
15556,I'm scared of the ocean.

7. complete mission
8. wait 8 months to play the final part (today)
9. satisfaction (marky mark and the funky bunch)
10. would reccomend"
15564,I've played raft off and on since the game released. Ive enjoyed the love the devs have given the game and each update. While I will admit the game can take a bit to learn once you learn all of the mechanics its a very enjoyable game you can play either with your friends to mess around or on your own to test yourself.
15565,weeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee
15566,the hats are pretty cool
15567,ver gud
15568,so this game is a game right which means oh i should play this in my free time but end up playing it on fridays only so i say you should maybe not get the game unless you want to get it cause this game is more of a uhhhh hold on let me think.......... i forgot what i was going to say but anyways i say get the game cause its so bad that like you should get it its worth to get but dont buy it cause it sucks
15569,great game. cannot wait to try out the update
15570,its good
15571,Sometimes I like to fill a sock with watermelon and beat my cat with a washing machine
15572,shark kinda bad fr
15573,"This game is awesome! 

So much to discover and explore and all started from 4 small floating foundation as your boat.  Raft evolves so much for me, as you build your boat and discover new islands and crafting materials.  I was totally not expecting this great adventure this game turns out to be!"
15574,Well worth the money...the team really has put a good effort into this title and have delivered well.
15575,great games for fun.
15576,"Really, it's a good game. so realistic, i recommend playing it!"
15577,A very refreshing take on the Survival Crafting genre. I don't know what it is about it but floating the days away on your raft is super peaceful. Also the game is beautiful and runs very well. 9/10 game at least
15578,Kill bruce
15579,"This is fun with friends, especially if youre racist"
15580,the shark bit my as
15581,i enjoy this game overall a great game gets boring by yourself sometimes but with a friend its better love all the mechanics and even if its a tiny thing like for example you can hover your mouse over one of the items needed for crafting and if you have the right resources for that say rope u dont have  2 rope but u have 4 palm leaves in your inventory instead of going to make the rope you can just hover your mouse over the rope with whatever your trying to craft and you can craft it from there the shark following you around all the time makes the game more challenging and the scenery is beatiful the whale event scares me tho ask my friend lol anyway this game is a very fun enjoyable game with friends from what the game used to be to this makes it such a good game (ps pufferfish funny)
15582,This is a great game
15583,shark bite ooo haha
15584,its got a little somethin for everyone
15585,Fun game with friends
15586,This game absolutely NEEDS crossplay to truly reach it's full potential.

Please remember to be polite and follow the Rules and Guidelines."
15597,"i dont really like this game it is just bare and the start is very, and also I would normally recommend this game, but the 1.0 update forced the game to be online-only; You literally cannot play the game in offline mode.

Can't recommend this until this is addressed."

15599,"No controller support in 2022 for a game like this, especially after being in early access and receiving feedback from players who no doubt wanted it......shame on you!"

15622,Awesome game. Super excited to play the final chapter update. Anyone that's a survival crafting fan will love this game and spend too much time playing it solo and with friends.
15623,RAFT HAS TAKEN OVER MY FUCKING LIFE I FUCKING LOVE RAFT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
15624,subnautica: caveman edition
15625,"If your looking for a different type of survival sandbox game, you should give Raft a try. Get a few of your friends together or find some online players to play with and jump in. This game features a unique waterworld style of play, where you begin on a simple raft surrounded by ocean with a hook line used to gather resources. Survive the turbulent ocean waters, find islands, ships, and eventually full settlements while gathering resources to expand your raft. I will be rating the game on 5 criteria, Replay Value, Game Play, Sound Effects, Multiplayer, and Sandbox System.

Replay Value : 4/5 🎩 - Sandbox games are never single run type games, so making sure your game wants you to return is important. If the game is mostly a big grind with very few adventure or discovery features, then it get bland quickly. Raft has a good balance of early discovery and adventure system.

Game Play: 4/5 🎩 Is the game easy to play, smooth, and/or buggy? The game starts you off quickly and for those who have no experience playing sandbox games, it is quite easy to learn what to do. The game is also very smooth, combat is overall okay, but occasionally visual bugs and placement bugs do occur as in most sandbox type games. But they don't break the game in my personal experience.

Sound Effects: 3/5 🎩 The background music and ambient sounds are quite relaxing for the most part. But the animal sounds, water sounds, and event the default volume of most sounds can get annoying. I usually have my background sounds set around 20% and Game sounds around 50% personally.

Multiplayer: 4/5 🎩 Is the game easy to play online? Yes. Is it better to play with others? Yes. Is it necessary to do multiplayer? No. But the game does seem to want players to play together and makes resource gathering and exploring more fun.

Sandbox System: 3/5 🎩 - The unique aspect of building on the water is something interesting. There are land elements to the game, but for the first major part of the game, you live on the high seas. If you don't enjoy it right off the bat, it could be difficult to enjoy the game. But overall the sandbox system works well and the biggest issue I have is the building systems are quite basic and could have done more, but the game is still good.

Overall Score: 3.7/5 🎩 - I give this game a 3.5~4 total, the game is fun, good for a group of friends or for solo adventuring. You will definitely get your money's worth in play time with this game. I have played it for 20 hours or during the early access and will be jumping back into the game for the 1.0 release. If you get this game on any kind of sale it is also worth the value. 

So if you enjoyed this review be sure to give me a follow on my twitch channel at https://twitch.tv/Danadin where I do various video and board gaming content, along with miniature painting content. I will be doing more reviews on various games in the future! Join the Pally Den!  @Danadin484 (Instagram and Twitter) & @Danadin (Minds)"

15640,"Very chill with bursts of excitement battling sharks & exploring islands that you come across as you drift & scavenge & build yourself an upcycled boathouse.  Great for playing with friends, as the building shenanigans are endless, & very enjoyable to be played as a couple.  My SO & I have had lots of laughs constructing home bases in games & this one definitely delivers in that regard.  Feels like Waterworld."
15641,great game
15642,"being made the ship's bitch, my friends took all of the weapons and went on to explore the bowls of an abandoned ship, leaving me completely defenseless against the shark that was slowly chewing our once impressive cruiser, into a pathetic 8x2 piece of drift wood"
15643,G43AT GAME BUT FIX THE GODAM GRAPHICS
15644,"Can't recommend this game, there are better survival games out there, this one at least for me is just annoying, everything in the game just irks me. Its grindy, tedious and brings nothing new other than drifting on water, and if i wanted a water game id just rather play subnautical."
15645,
15646,"very goood game me like
"
15647,Good game and storyline. Some of the achivemts are very hard to get.
15648,good shit
15649,"A friend described this as ""a base-builder where you take your base with you, instead of gradually venturing further away from your base"" and that exactly sums up what is so unique and fun about Raft. It's great to play with friends, or alone. It has plenty of design elements for the creative types, and ample upgrade trees and toys for the engineers. Seasick mode is excellent if you don't like to ride the waves. There are game-play options for restricting the monsters, or you can learn how to deal with and minimize their impact. The plot locations are intriguing and really cool to come upon totally unaware of what to expect. It's really easy to follow and figure out what to do next with minimal wiki checking. The whole game fits and flows really well. I've enjoyed almost 100 hours of Raft at this point and with the last update, I am looking forward to a hefty amount more!"
15650,this game is flipping amazing especially when you have a heck of a fun time with friends. it was already great before chapter 3 and this just made it better. its so hecking awesome you have to buy it RIGHT NOW!!!!!!

15661,Game will make you lose your life for 3 weeks. Its ultra good and the content is great. It's better with at least 1 more person since the revive mechanic can come in clutch in the early hours. Concentrate on upgrading your first floor to plated floors so bruce can't break through them. Highly recommend.

15680,I bought this game years ago and still have a great time playing it with friends or by myself. Would strongly recommend to people who like survival/building games or just playing with friends.
15681,need more water
15682,"to much water
"
15683,There is a shark named Bruce.
15684,well my friends a boy scout so i beat it easily
15685,Very fun to play with friends and very exited for the new update the Final chapter i would definitely buy this game if another friend or person that you can play with!!! Definitely worth it for the money!
15686,good game

15695,really fun and cool
15696,"I like the type of ""do what you want"" game. Shark is a bit scary"
15697,W game
15698,"Super fun to play with friends. I have yet to play it solo although I think it would be rather relaxing to not have to worry about your friends neglecting the raft for a plastic bag only to be attacked by the shark when they would have been safe on the raft the whole time. 9/10 would recommend, even just for a time passer."
15699,its fun
15700,"I am a 45 yo father, probably one of the oldest people playing this game. I am a single farther to my Son, who is 14 now. My son got this game for Christmas, so we installed it on his computer and he started playing. By the end of the week he had 24 hours on this game. This was horrible for me, as it was already hard for me to find ways to spend time with my son, as he is always out with his friends or just, watching YouTube. So i decided to make a Steam account and get this game to see if I could maybe play alongside him. loaded into the game, made my character and world and started playing but I was stuck on what you where supposed to do. I asked my Son for help and he hosted a game for me to join. loved it as it was the best time had spent with my Son since my wife had died. This game has ever since brought me and my son closer again and now we actually spend time together outside the house together as well. This game reminded me that there's fun to be had in everything, and it has brought both me and my Son many happy memories"
15701,"This game is awesome to play with a friend or two.

My suggestion is to play it on Easy so you aren't constantly hosting a fish fry in between bouts of stabbing Bruce the shark in the face because he won't stop eating that tasty raft wood. In other words, the thirst and hunger meters are more fun on Easy because it gives you more time to focus on the other parts of the game. Go ahead, judge me."

15716,its a game
15717,i love poaching helpless animals and boats are quite cool.
15718,"as someone whos been here since the beginning, so proud of the progress that's been made over the years and really excited to play the full release and everything it has to offer.. raft is a tremendously fun game and has great replay value, every time a new chapter would be released my friends and i would start from scratch with a new raft design and try out all the new content and just have a good time... its almost bittersweet knowing the game is finished but im sure there is more to come and more fun to be had"

15728,Like eating potato chips.
15729,"was a good game until i got to the ch.3 story islands. 
now it sucks. 
I've been stuck not knowing where to go for more than a week in game on the crane island.

 i'm frustrated, and lost, and no walkthroughs are any help because of everyone who doesn't want spoilers are making it hard for people like me with learning disabilities to find out where to go or what to do. 
I WANTED AN ADVENTURING GAME, NOT A PUZZLE GAME."
15730,Playing this game is an absolute pleasure.
15731,idk if i have this game

15738,very very nice.
15739,best game ever
15740,w game no boobs tho
15741,Raft is a very fun progressive survival game and is my personal favorite even compared to Minecraft. It is amazing and is worth double its price. Keep playing and you'll find so many new things or look at them in Creative. So stoked to play the Final Chapter!
15742,dat shii good and shii yuh kno
15743,Do you know how you can get hungry from sheer boredom? This happened to me while playing the game.
15744,super cool
15745,"Honestly this is a great game and it really captures an ocean survival game thats on the water, you can fish and build rafts and they have so much creativity, its a shame that the 3rd chapter is the last update they will make, this game had alot more potential, but dont let that clog your decision because its a great game !"
15746,fdsfchdvh
15747,"ALERT, A GOOD GAME HAS LEFT EARLY ACCESS. BREAK OUT THE CHAMPAGNE.

If you somehow don't know what this game is, I recommend going into it blind. You can figure out most everything yourself and it'll be an absolutely lovely time. Be sure to grab a friend too, it helps mitigate the raft madness! It's absolutely worth $20, but if you can grab it on sale more power to you."
15748,"Been following this game since it came out on Itch.io forever ago and now the 1.0 is here!!!
Get it play it with your friend!!"
15749,R A F T.....nice
15750,"A hook, a small raft,  water, and floating debris. It begins so small, so quiet, and so simple. Eventually, element by element, the game blossoms into something much more and unexpected. Raft has received overwhelmingly positive reviews for a reason. Just buy the game and experience it for yourself."
15751,"This game is good, exept for the fact that it's really boring. All you do is collect materials and build your raft."
15752,Great Game a lot of fun. Playing co-op still challenging and fun
15753,"This game captures a lot of great parts for what it's trying to be and It's an early access done right. They had a vision for what they wanted the game to become, we got content,  a story and best of all a fun experience. There is both chill building and tense diving moments with exploration in-between. My only negative factor would be a single small glitch and an annoying enemy but otherwise a really great game.

Def a recommended for friends and solo. 8.5/10"

15792,"10/10 story, you have to travel to different locations on the endless ocean using a signal reciever and there are currently 8 locations and 3 chapters in the game with 2 secret islands/ rare islands.
10/10 gameplay, addictive, fun, you have to collect trash from the ocean to build your raft and any blueprints you unlock, there are 19 blueprints currently in the game and 6 playable characters (2 can be played from the start and the other 4 have to be unlocked in the story)
Recommend buying"

15809,This game is so fun! I disassociate for hours playing <3 ( that's how you know it's good lol). I love how you can stick to the main story line. or just do your own thing and both offer tons of great content. 10/10 for me!
15810,ziši
15811,"because 
I said so"
15812,"Everything about this game is bad. Main game play loop is boring and the story is so uninteresting it may as well not be there. The default move speed is a snails pace which becomes hell when you begin exploring the bigger islands, it doesn't give you enough resources which makes building feel tedious.  

I didn't even buy it and I want my money back. I played the entire game with my friend and the only reason I didn't give a negative review was to avoid hurting her feelings."
15813,"Great fun, with lots of little things to discover and cute achievements to gain."
15814,Very fun and addicting.
15815,tons of relaxing fun!
15816,A pretty cool game and fun. For people who love to chill and build a base and the story is quite good actually. Great co-op expeirence as well
15817,"its fine


(if you have friends)"
15818,your friends use as farm bots

"
15823,i am afraid of water
15824,"Best game to play alone or with friends, love it and love the story"
15825,"Raft is special, in my opinion the best co op game you can play"
15826,e
15827,"Raft is a wonderful, simple, and satisfying game. It's fun solo, but the real fun comes with playing in a group. The ability to decorate and build your own unique raft, boat, or for some incredibly creative 'yachts', is amazing. I had spent hours solo floating and building and was surprised to find a small story within the game. There's very few bugs I've found, but definitely not discouraging.

Playing with a group of friends is where the game really shines, you can always ask who has the last 3 scrap, find out who is the best shark hunter,  who likes to be the cook most, and who has the most unique architecture. 

Raft is a lot of fun. As someone who played in early access, I can't wait to dive into the new update. I hope the Final Chapter truly isn't the last, for this is a game you can always pick back up and have fun in over and over, deciding what direction to go  with your raft each time. Directional and decoratively."
15828,its good
15829,"Thanks, Bruce!"
15830,very good very nice
15831,very fun

15837,Apparently pollution is good for you in this game.
15838,10/10
15839,Blub blub raft good game. Me like
15840,"I run around on Apex most of the time. There's a lot of rapid fire and yelling and screaming and getting angry. 

So sometimes it's nice to just chill with a game.

Until that damn shark shows up..

This is a fantastic game, I've loved every second I've played it. If you enjoy light-survival games with cool building mechanics and a bit of mystery thrown in, do yourself a favor and check out Raft!"
15841,Yes
15842,i love this game so much fun with friends but i feel like the game has some really good potentials to have more and more story but it hasnt so in 28 hours i alreafy finished it

15847,"it is a survival game and there is so much stuff to do,  I think that it is complex for a game that's about surviving on a  raft in the middle of the ocean."

15849,"great creativity, you can build whatever you want. It's amazing"
15850,GOOD GAME
15851,Fun and easy game to relax and play.
15852,YAS THE UPDATE CAME OUT BITCHES LEZ GO--
15853,"BOAT!
"
15854,"I enjoy playing this when I get off work. the background music is calming and the constant need to do something keeps you engaged. The part I like the most is you do not have to commit a certain amount of time to it, you can play for 30 mins or you could play for 3 hrs and either time will not be a bad point or place to save game.
If there was any dislike it would be dying a lot at the start. I just decided to go easy mode for my first play through and will try the harder ones later ;o).
"
15855,"Raft is a very good game. From its humble beginnings as the indie game who dreamed, to a very popular open world game, it really gives you the feel that the creators put lots of effort when crafting this game, now more than ever thanks to the new update. I highly recommend anyone with some free time gets this game; its fun, relaxing, and lots of good fun with all your friends! :)"
15856,"This game is wonderful, and the trophies are actually a good challenge, and I love the Flow of the story along with the progression ... 10/10 -God of Chaos"

Recommend 11/10"
15858,"There's a bit of a learning curve but it's a lot of fun once you figure it out.  EA did very little hand holding, so it can be a bit of a rough start.  Hopefully 1.0 gives a bit more guidance, but very much looking forward to all the added content."

15870,Bro one of the best Co op games i played
15871,"Amazing game with a very side campaign. I was blown away by how interesting the campaign was. However, the campaign was quite short which left us a little bored after completion. The only motivation we have as of right now is to upgrade our raft so that we could attempt the next level in the campaign once it releases. 
The only downside would be how glitchy the water is for me."
15872,finally out of early access. the wait was very much worth it.
15873,new update so good i did a handstand
15874,"[h1] Save gone after the Final Chapter release [/h1]

After 1.0 update, my save broke to the point that there's nothing except few stairs and floors. I cannot spawn into world with issue of ""connecting to the host"" even though I'm playing in world no one can join. All the 100+ hrs of farming gone - animals, materials, chests full of materials food, equipment any many more.
All the collections are gone as well as quest progress. Considering amount of time I have spent preparing for this final chapter destroyed any fun I have had with the game.

15941,"This game is very addicting, however I will say that replayability is very low. Once you complete the story, there's no point in playing again unless you want to build your raft differently. All locations and the progression through the story line is the same - playing the game twice will not necessarily warrant two different playing experiences."

It was hard to choose between easy to learn/hard to master and actual brain usage just because the learning curve in the beginning is a bit steep. There's no tutorial or guidance so figuring out what you need to do in the beginning can be a bit intensive (and you will die... a lot...) unless you get into the community and ask questions/look for tips. Once I got into the community and figured out how the game worked it was like ""oh I'm dumb. How did I not notice this?"" cause its actually really simple but not necessarily intuitive. Oh, and build a spear and extra hook as soon as you can... like earlier than you think you'll need one. thank me later.

---{ Grind }---
☐ Nothing to grind
☐ Only if u care about leaderboards/ranks
☑ Isn't necessary to progress
☐ Average grind level
☐ Too much grind
☐ You'll need a second life for grinding
Ok, so there's literally NO grind to complete the story. If you just go story island to story island and make the minimum pit stops in between you can complete the whole story without a drop of real grind. However, if you want to take your time and build a really cool raft and really get into the crafting and building aspects of the game (which is my favorite part) then you will need to grind for resources. The minimum is there to survive and complete the story, but any extras you're gonna need to grind for. That said, the grind is actually pretty enjoyable. Gathering resources can actually be pretty relaxing so even though its grind, its enjoyable grind.

☐ It'll replace your life
Great story and the story islands are super interesting and fun to explore. Being able to go back to story islands and they respawn resources so you get to explore again is also a nice little feature. Granted, the stuff is in the same place but what the stuff is changes. 

---{ Game Time }---
☐ Long enough for a cup of coffee
☐ Short
☐ Average
☐ Long
☑ To infinity and beyond
If you just wanna rush through the story, speed runners do it in about 2-3 hours. But, if you like to just build and build and explore the time is limitless. I'm close to 500 hours and the bulk is on a single save. Even when the story is over, you can keep on playing as long as you want which is great. Then there's creative mode which lets you just build - no supplies or grind needed. If you like building, its really limitless.

---{ Price }---
☐ It's free!
☑ Worth the price
☐ If it's on sale
☐ If u have some spare money left
☐ Not recommended
☐ You could also just burn your money
Honestly, the dev's could charge more and I'd still say worth the price. Its early access but definitely doesn't feel like early access. 100% worth the price, no steam sale needed.

---{ Bugs }---
☐ Never heard of
☐ Minor bugs
☑ Can get annoying
☐ ARK: Survival Evolved
☐ The game itself is a big terrarium for bugs
Some bugs can be annoying (like on occasion you might get stuck on a charging hog - that's probably the most annoying) but there aren't any major major bugs and the dev team does a great job when a bug comes up at trying to fix it and address it. Then there are some bugs (like the floating floor trick) that started as bugs but now its become so widely used that people don't even want it fixed (for the most recent update people literally said please don't fix this bug). So yes, some annoying ones but they don't really take away from the game so don't let those couple of glitches scare you off!

---{ ? / 10 }---

☐ 10

Overall I give this game an 8/10 just because of the few glitches that can be annoying and because of the learning curve with no tutorial or instructions. The community has been great at stepping in and trying to guide new players though, so if you buy be sure and check out the community page and/or the raft discord if you have any trouble. Once you get the hang of it, the fun is pretty limitless between just working on a main save and creative mode and then even speed running if you're into that. There's also a very active mod community so you'll find a lot of stuff to do. Absolutely a worthwhile buy!!

15952,"This game has been a great  deal of joy for myself. Played 122 hours of it and not one moment has been spent wondering what to do next. This game keeps on giving you more and more to do so its endless fun for someone like myself whos enjoys to survive in a dangerous world. This is an easier game for new people who want to start on survivor games. 10 outta 10 stars hand down

15956,"Other than a few minor glitches and birds dropping rocks that curve down and home in on your head , this game is great. Lots of things to do , islands to discover and explore and a raft to build. Definitely worth the price, just hoping this game goes next level and gets the attention and updates it deserves."

15978,"Watched and was gifted the game to play with some of my friends, the game is a must play if you enjoy survival games. Raft reinvents the idea of a strategic survival game with multiple new challenges in a new setting and has an interesting story to follow along the way. 10/10 would recommend to a friend or anyone who wants either a great single player or co-op experience."

15993,Hunger and thirst system makes this game painful to play. You'll be spending more time trying to not die from either one than doing anything remotely fun.
15994,"A relaxing (when you play on that setting) ride on the open seas with mysteries to explore, calming music, and materials to dive for and collect. Your raft can be as luxurious or simple as you'd like, but don't let it go because your raft is your home and the ocean is endlessly vast."
15995,nice relaxing until bruce or the birds attack but fun none the less. can't wait for the end of the game update!
15996,"This game is very open world and free, also you can focus on the storyline which rewards with new items to unlock. I recommend getting this game with friends but its still fun by yourself."
15997,NEW CHAPOTER JUST DROPPED GREAT GAME DEF RECOMEND
15998,"1. Start the game with your friends 
2. gets hungry and thirsty in game 
3. yelling at your friends for taking all the food 
4. dies of thirst and hunger and screams more 
5. becomes friends again
6. someone kill all the animals 
7. screaming at the one who killed all the animals 
8. gets new animals 
9. threatens anyone who comes near the animals 
10. finish the game"

16010,just a fantastic game thats perfect to play with your friends. theirs always a good mood in raft
16011,"very good, very nice"
16012,Shark ate my raft.. so I ate him back. 10/10
16013,fun
16014,"Make a cup, poke the shark, find a muffler, poke the shark, eat a whole watermelon, poke the shark, fish for barrels, poke the shark. Raft is a hidden GEM of a game. I remember when the radio tower was the only non-island location you could visit and the mystery and excitement finding it for the first time with my friend was such an amazing experience. Playing solo is relaxing but with friends this game is a 10/10. You can entirely go your own pace which is nice for a dumb dumb like me. It's simple at first but you can definitely put over 100 hours in a save. Today the Final Chapter comes out which is supposed to overhaul the story, add new playable characters, new items, new locations etc. I'll update after playing the new changes! :)"
16015,"I adore this game.

For me this is an excellent game which soothes my soul.
The gameplay keeps you mentally busy, while the background music is very chill.
Theres a storyline.. Which is at least something :p But honestly it doesn't need much :)

So, yeh, survive hunger and thirst. Battle the shark, progress in building your raft and things evolve from there.

I've done a new run every time there's new content and loved it.

Worth every dime, for the hours you can sink into this game."
16016,Great survival game. I was happy to pick it up with the release of 1.0.

Tonight when he gets off work, we will be back on our grind with the new update! Let's just say, my mom is excited cause she gets the living room to herself again. XD"

It also scratches the end game itch with new content and a story that helps you delve deeper into more advanced survival and base building.

16096,"Raft is a rather unassuming game when you first get started. I thought of just another survival build game, but the story, the items, and the pride you develop for your raft sets this game over the top. I LOVE it, I've played it both solo and with friends. With friends is better, but only because friends are best."

16120,"I Love it
"
16121,Ever since I was 9 I watched videos of raft and thought it was so cool! I never wanted anything else so badly. I only had an Xbox one S so my hopes of ever getting raft crashed and burned. 5 years later I started watching raft videos again and I saw how much it has changed! I eventually bought a gaming PC and my first game I bought was Raft. I had never been so happy to finally experience it! It was well worth 20 bucks and I thoroughly suggest if you are reading this to get raft! This game has given me so many good memories that will surely stay in my heart.

16171,"By playing Raft I get the same relaxing feeling like playing Minecraft. The calm gameplay with ambiente music makes me feel good. 
Expanding the raft is really fun, there are already so much decorative elements to make cozy cabin and the exploring aspect of the game makes keeps me playing on and on, from island to island. There is definitely a satisfying factor to loot in this game."
16172,"This game offers plenty of options to play the way you want. You can play a peaceful mode which is so relaxing, just spending hours listening to the chill music, building your raft, exploring new islands. Or you can crank it up to battle for your life fighting sharks, boars, bears, seagulls, exploding fish and the simple threat of thirst and hunger. Play by yourself for some quiet private time or play with friends for some crazy laughs. I truly love this game and keep returning to it each time a new chapter is released. I'll start a new game when the final chapter is released so I can take the journey from start to finish on one raft. Can't wait!"
16173,When I first saw it it it did not look good but when I played it I could not stop with the game and its story.

16180,fun
16181,"Always been a fan of survival games that rely on organisational skills whilst providing a wide range of cosmetics and freedom of design. The hunt for civilisation through exploring different biomes and discovering materials and needed equipment makes the journey so much more enjoyable, mysterious and exciting for a casual gamer who is usually afraid of taking that first step and going forward. This game has also really helped me in getting over my fear of sharks and the deep dark depths, when it comes to games that is. It is a great game to play with friends, especially when watching them fumble with survival basics and tackling the shark issue."
16182,Cool
16183,it cool and fun
16184,very good game if you play it with friendrs

16297, Calming and nice
16298,"I have loved this game since my husband first got me to play it. It is a survival game with a story but mostly on you navigating this mostly water world with islands and other destinations. I love the idea of building your own functional raft that you can take anywhere. I also love the discoveries you find on this game whether it be notes or little nuggets of story or new things to build for your raft. With the tools I am given, I feel I can do whatever I want. There are some dangers if you play on higher levels or mostly peaceful if you play on lower ones. Totally a fun game with or without friends. 
Most things or bugs in this game have been fixed since first playing it. I have spent 400 hours on this game. Totally the game for me, someone that loves playing video games, a little ocd, anxious and just wants a game to escape to when needing to wind down or shut off my overthinking."
16299,"vey fun. pls downloads and play with me, i dont have frens"

I have seen it grow and get better over time and it's nice to see it finish."
16304,boat go swoosh swoosh
16305,"After the announcement of the last part its time to write my comment.. I finished the game both alone and with friends both at peaceful and in normal mode. I crafted and built and i explored.. both feelings were fulfilling. I found that game awesome before and now that i saw what its going to be added i think it reached its final form and what form that is. Beautiful scenery in colorful cartoonish designs with a scent of realism. The feeling that you are lost in the sea is strong especialy in the beggining and slowly you realise theres more to this universe as the story unflods...(mild teaser/spoil). It gers more interesting with more crafting options and animals/beings and with different terrains. The gameplay of a floating base, practicly however you want it to be, its  amazing. The game in my opinion is not fairly characterized as early access as it is complete with unnoticable bugs and a nice story mode (that can be turned into sandbox if you feel like it and build whatever u want). I strongly recommend to play alone or in duo; maximum three players is okay if you jast want to see the story, but if you want to sit back and relax (with the beautiful music and sunsets), craft and build, three might be a cost to communication and coordination. Other than that the game runs smoothly and its really worth your time and money. I bought it for 15 euros and now it costs 20 euros.. worth every cent!"

16316,"Only played for a short time so far but I found this game very entertaining in that time. The whole base-building idea is very nice, and it is very satisfying to progress through the game. The graphics and performance are good, bugs are relatively rare and progression isn't too slow."
16317,"Really fun game, so many things to do and when you think you've done everything you bumb into an island or something. Its really fun definitely recommend"
16318,Awesome game. It's easily one of my favourites. It can be both relaxing and exciting.
16319,Generally a good game to either play with friends to either just have a good time or to grind and spend ages to complete. Rlly good for when ur bored too :)
16320,Good game
16321,"It is an amazing game and I very much recommend it. Do not try to run it on anything weak though as it will lag, even at low graphics. If you have a medium strength computer (I do) it will run beautifully on max graphics, which are beautiful. The combination of adventure, survival, building, and combat makes it one of my favourite games. Overall I highly recommend it and also recommend joining the Raft Discord as it has an amazing community and they post teasers and update notifications."
16322,yes
16323,this a great game
16324,kill shark
16325,Very fun
16326,This is a great well made game that has a great balance between real life and fake stuff. For example drinking water underwater. It would be very annoying if I ran out of water because I could drink if im underwater.
16327,it gud
16328,This is a really fun game for beginners i recommend peaceful and when you beat the game you go up a difficulty or you could play in creative and build something huge or an idea you have.
16329,game is full of griefing bug abusers that join your PRIVATE lobby and destroy your raft
16330,"Have small hours on this game due to my computer blowing up, But i enjoyed every min of this game and im coming back to it! This game is very well done and the updates are fantastic! It's grindy but worth it! Have not had issues with this game! Please get it you wont regret it.

Came back to this game, its sooooo good, once you start being able to automate stuff it gets better. Grindy but well done."

16343,"i replayed it a bunch of time, it's one of my favourite games."
16344,"Best survival game so far, the shark attacking you 24/7 is a bit annoying tho, could use some variations like piranhas or jelly fish stings to make the levels difficult"

i absolutely loved this game, mods great fun, but soon it just broke, the frames just suddenly became 3, even after restarting and reinstalling so many times, clearing my worlds, basically just removing everything about it. i don't know if its my computer or a bug, but i just can't even play.
still reccomend it tho"

16369,"I like this game, I personally think this is way better with friends."
16370,This game is the best example of what Early Access should be.
16371,"Its an interesting idea, but is pretty boring to play. While most base building games have you exploring the world, you'll spend most of your time in Raft simply looking at the ocean collecting random bits of crap that happen to float by you. And in that ceaseless deluge of flotsam, you will find planks, fronds, and bits of plastic which you will use to build a larger raft. 
Unfortunately that's pretty much the entire game in a nutshell. Ocasionally you'll flloat aimlessly to some tiny island where you can chop down a tree and collect a few flowers and some fruit. Then its back onto the Raft to collect more floating debris. 

What I will say for the game is that the building element is nicely done, even if its pretty rudimentary in design. Your raft can turn into a true ship, with multiple decks that basically auto-hauls trash out of the sea for you. But this is more like a sea-cleanup simulation than an actual game. Massive floatillas are only interesting if there is actual warfare, but that's not really a part of the gameplay here.

16383,good game very fun
16384,I love this game! It's so much fun especially when you play with other people! I wish there were more decorative items (But there's already a lot. I just like customizing my raft) The graphics can get a little wonky but if you play everything at the lowest setting it works better (at least for me) I really like the way the game works and it's great group game for you and your friends!
16385,VERY TASTIE
16386,very fun and edicting toooooooooooooooooooo
16387,"It's a great game, although it really shines in multiplayer. It has nice graphics, the systems/mechanics of items and objects are good, and the story, although a little cut-and-dry, is pretty cool. Unless you have the equivalent of a potato PC, it runs pretty well, even when (this happens to me a lot) some 10 collection nets are all full. If you're looking for some casual single/multi-player survival fun, this is the perfect game for you!

One thing to keep in mind though - Once you've done almost everything you can do and have completed all the story- until the devs release Chapter 3 (edit: YES ITS OUT NOW)- there isn't much to do unless you bring a friend. Have fun!"
16388,This game is really fun and if you like singal player games or multiplayer games that are fun this is the game for you. You can play alone or get some friends to join the raft and inbrase in the storey line and jest have fun.
16389,It is what it looks like. Simple and nice game to play with friends.

Also a shame that they dont sell the OST because its soothing and calming. Really good game and one of my favorites to play with friends.

16404,Honestly really great game. Had a blast playing with friends so far completing the main campaign with an intriguing story and fun game mechanics. Hyped for chapter 3!
16405,"I bought this game 5 minutes after it released (I also played the original itch.io version), back when it didn't have a story. Because of that I didn't have a real reason to play it for too long. Coming back to the game now feels so weird. It has come a long way from the fun time waster that it was originally. Wholeheartedly recommend!"
16406,good
16407,"I am writing this after 83 hours of time play, and well, if you want to enjoy a cruise and pack, it can be a good choice.
You can start building a unique boat for yourself with your friends and build it as you like and travel the different islands one by one.
Of course, in the meantime, you have to deal with creatures that try to harm you, the main of which may be a shark, it may be easy to kill, but it can definitely ruin the boat if you are not careful !!
You can progress over time and find easier ways to travel between islands, from sails to boat and radar engines, etc., each of which can make things easier for you.
But you should not forget that you were playing a survival game and you should also be aware of water and food.
A game full of things that can create a good experience with your friends or even just you, so do not doubt to experience it!"

16441,very good :D
16442,"I really enjoy the mellow music and scenery whilst waiting for an island, its nice to dissolve yourself into the sea and forget the normal world. The game progresses quite quickly if you know what your doing, but its exciting with the small challenges involving the pigeons, screecher and shortages in items if going slower. The storyline is amazing and overall very interesting, especially when your able to travel to and see what amazing works the previous survivors had made, along with the harsh story itsself. Although it might take a bit to get to an island, there's a lot to do on the raft over time. You can start fishing, building and discovering different ways to decorate. I highly recommend this game to others, especially if your into scenery, story-involved games, creative building and water :) even if your afraid of the sea- like me! I cant wait to see the future progression of this game, its already got so much."

16470,"I remember when I played raft a couple years ago with my friends. The game is very time consuming when you first start out a raft, but the more you keep expanding, the less you have to struggle. It only takes close to maybe 5+ hours to get up to a decent sized raft with the proper materials. It can take less depending on how fast you get through the game. There is also lots of hooking for wood, plastics, and stuff. The game is not to hard to figure out. 

Worth the try if you like slow paced survival games and building stuff."

The difficulty is adjustable, wich is great for me, Gotta go, I wanna play again ;) and again..."
16487,I would recommend this game I think because it's a game I highly recommend to anyone who would want to play this game. How I know its a good game is because I recommend it to anyone. It's actually greatly fun I would recommend. 10/10 would recommend shoutouts to my buddy joseph

I'm so glad i had bought it shortly after because it has always been one of my favorite games hands down. I had been going through some stuff and it just felt nice to hear that calming music and enjoy a nice relax-full game that's challenging but in its own way. its defiantly one of those games whoever plays it will get nostalgia from it when they grow up."
16504,GOOD GAME

16510,very god shark bite tho + you can eat him
16511,Good game
16512,"reminds me of that one scene in titanic where the titanic hits the iceberg except theres no iceberg but instead theres some sharks that try to break the titanic (really in this case its more like a raft, hence the name of the game) but its also like if titanic was just that one scene like 50 times in a row and in one of those scenes theres one part of a guy hanging a fish up on a wall"
16513,good
16514,Very fun with friends
16515,best game ever
16516,"Very good!

Got it gifted for my birthday!"
16517,"I thought this game would be super boring and easy. its the opposite. It's probably one of the most fun games I've played. (A total of 6 hours already and i got it like 2 days ago) Me and my friend LOVE this game, but we don't even have many things. (If you want your game to be more fun name your shark Bessy and just go in a country accent yelling ""BESSY IS BITING THE DANG BOAT!"") In conclusion, just get it bro."

16546,"Soooo good!The story of it is that it was all land. . . THEN!. . . A huge flood came. Hills turned into islands and the land became water. . . now so many creatures are living down there. . . you just have to explore. Your start off stranted, starting to make it homy, with a grill, small purifier and a. . . uncomftorbale bed. But the player in the game doesn't react to it. The more you play, the more you get, the more you explore, the more good loot you get. Have fun exploring rafters! (the finale update is here!) Thanks a lot! ^w^ ^^ :3 ;3 'w' 'W' ""w"" ""W"""

16573,"Not a game for 2022!

Bought it when there were only 1 or 2 parts to the story and ""finished"" it. 
Came back after years. 3h hours in, me and brother died and lost all inventory. There is no body, no loot sack, no drops, nothing. All gone.... Uninstall.

Game is the same as when it was released on early access (4 years ago). All the jenkiness and terrible combat mechanics are there but, it got worst cuz they added new enemies.

So for 4 (FOUR!!!!!!) years all you guys did was develop more cosmetics and uninteresting/lazy story? F* off.

The building mechanics are so nice and you have a built in""crafting table"" in your inventory which is extraordinarily convenient. There's a lot you can do in this game and I feel like I've only scratched the surface, I can tell there's lots of hours to be put into this game. Overall very fun, good mechanics, can be played solo or multiplayer highly recommend"

16669,"I am a 45 yo father, probably one of the oldest people playing this game. I am a single farther to my Son, who is 14 now. My son got this game for Christmas from his uncle, so we installed it on his computer and he started playing. By the end of the week he had 24 hours on this game. This was horrible for me, as it was already hard for me to find ways to spend time with my son, as he is always out with his friends or just, watching YouTube. So i decided to make a Steam account and get this game to see if I could maybe play alongside him. loaded into the game, made my character and world and started playing but I was stuck on what you where supposed to do. I asked my Son for help and he hosted a game for me to join. loved it as it was the best time had spent with my Son since my wife had died. This game has ever since brought me and my son closer again and now we actually spend time together outside the house together as well. This game reminded me that there's fun to be had in everything, and it has brought both me and my Son many happy memories."
16670,"i'm kinda conflicted on whether or not i like this game or not. 50% of the time i'm having fun with a friend while doing some fishing but the other 50% i'm extremely bored because i don't want to have to go on a damn island to get resources

my biggest problem is basically just that i hate going on the islands, they're not fun and they look extremely bland, but they're a key part of the game. i like just chilling on my raft and fishing. i like the setting of the ocean more. 

the reason i gave it a no, is because the question is ""Do you recommend this game?"" and if a friend asked me, ""should i buy raft?"" i would probably say no."

16724,"An ocean survival building game, where a shark is always hunting you, and your always on or by a raft. There are some animals, and many items. This game is getting good updates still, and I would say right now its worth a try. Just make sure to not leave your raft, because if you cant find it you will get lost and die, as whenever your raft leaves the radius islands or such that you may be on, will disappear. Overall its a solid game."

"
16744,"I cannot recommend this game enough omg. It was on my wishlist forever and I finally bought it Saturday because I needed something new to play and clocked 27 hours over the weekend. Safe to say it sucks you in!

Pros:
- Raft building is fun with a lot of customization within the limitations of the current parts available.
- Exploring the world is exciting and I LOVE being able to both explore islands and reefs.
- The graphics are amazing and game mechanics really simple.
- I played 13 hrs before realizing I hadn't actually triggered the campaign yet, googled how to do that, then played another 5 hours before I was like ""ok let's see this story"". It's really easy to just float around and gather items and craft them without a care in the world! (On peaceful mode anyway)
- The storyline is really compelling and also makes you think about how bad things could get if we don't get a handle on the climate crisis hahahahahahahahahahaaaaaaaaaaaaa D':

Cons:
- The game has been out for 4 years and the story is still not fully released. Really glad I bought it now when Ch. 3 is coming out soon rather than a year ago.
- There is ZERO tutorial. You are literally and figuratively thrown to the shark(s). I recommend starting on Peaceful mode and learning the proverbial ropes before even attempting Easy or above. 
- There's no prologue or anything to indicate this is a post-apocalyptic Earth, you just have a notebook with an extremely vague letter from your sister and a photo, you only grasp that it's Earth when you embark on the campaign.

Would be nice to haves:
- A prologue that has a tutorial for the game- this could be really short, mostly a cutscene, and then the raft could be broken up by Bruce and you float away from your family. Idk, either way it would be a good intro to the game and make it that much more compelling. I would actually have been invested in the storyline if that happened vs. spending 20 hrs exploring on my own lol
- A better way to produce/harvest/collect items, especially plastic and wood. Both are used a LOT and it would be helpful to work up to some sort of processing machine or something that spits out more of these materials.
- MORE CONTENT PLS. I've been reading that Ch.3 will be the last one and tbh that makes me really sad. I love this game so much now and I hope that we get more content in some way! Maybe DLCs or some such thing. 
- Would be cool to have a couple islands that have survivor communities that we can navigate to and trade for money or goods (don't tell me if I just haven't gotten to this yet NO SPOILERS lol) 

Anyway, buy this game!! You won't be sorry you did! :D"

16751,"The game starts you off with just a small raft, in the middle of an ocean. To progress, you have to collect the floating material from the ocean, meanwhile expanding your raft, crafting better tools, and researching new equipment in order to find new items, areas, and islands. But you aren't the only survivor.

[b]Gameplay[/b]
The gameplay style of Raft is unique. I really enjoyed that you can build a ""floating house"" in a sandbox building style, personally, I would say similar to Rust. To do more comparing, I would say this is the opposite of Subnautica, where you actually spend more time on land and above the water rather than below the water. Because the raft building is sandbox-like, you can choose whether you'll make it simple, space-efficient, fancy, or a mix of all.
Most of the materials you get in the early game will be collected from the ocean. However, to move on in the game, you have to explore new islands which in the early game will be dependent on your luck of finding any. As you proceed on the game, you will slowly start getting faster on these islands, and later find bigger ones too. These islands offer you new loot which is required to collect to make your game easier and faster.
My only complaint is that the progress you make in the early game is really, really slow. Collecting material for various tools and equipment takes a long time when the tools you already have are not that great and your raft's movement speed is really slow to access new islands and more material on the ocean. And when you get started, you really get started. At a certain point of the game, progress will be really fast and you'll easily complete the story quickly.

[b]Graphics, performance, bugs[/b]
The game has beautiful and colorful graphics and textures, somewhat cartoonish and wacky. I played my game in high graphical settings, and it had no issues running at 144 FPS. Surprisingly, the game doesn't really have bugs, and even then most bugs are graphical errors that apparently are tied to how waves work (sharks ""flying"" on the water when the water surface is below the normal, and bodies moving below to the ground along with waves). Some other bugs are tied to animals' AI, which can be both, useful and annoying at certain times.

[b]Story[/b]
There is barely any story in the early game, but you'll get your first clue when you obtain your first blueprint. Shortly, the story is all about finding the past of other survivors, visiting the areas they were living in, learning what they were doing, what went wrong, and what happened to them. The story is definitely in a dystopian future, where sea levels have risen to the point that big cities are drowning and people must live in the middle of nowhere. The story definitely added gameplay value to this game, and it was something that went smoothly throughout the whole gameplay. As this review was written, we're still waiting for chapter 3 which is meant to add more story.
Proceeding on the story is important gameplay-wise too, as blueprints received from these story areas obtain you new recipes for better gear and tools.

The game was great in my opinion. It was something that I enjoyed playing throughout the game and watching videos about. The game has a multiplayer option too. I struggled to find anyone to play with, but as I looked to the official Raft Discord server, they included a channel where you can find players to play with. The game also offers you different difficulties and gamemodes. The game is 20€, which I could argue about being too high as I did not find full value of in my current playtime. Therefore I might suggest you buying this during the sale, especially when the game is still being in early access. If you like exploration with a touch of sandbox and multiplayer, I strongly suggest you getting this. I would rate this game 8/10. Excited for chapter 3 and what it brings us."
16752,"Definitely worth the $20, husband and I bought it as something we can play together, and it is honestly more fun than most games we're played."
16753,great game
16754,Good stuff.
16755,l
16756,"This is a pretty decent survival game with building/crafting mechanics. Surviving can be difficult at first because you really have to focus on food and water first while also trying to expand your raft to make room for everything you'll need to survive. Eventually, it does get much easier and I really enjoy how chill the game becomes the further you progress. 
The game also does a decent job giving you places and reasons to explore as well as rewarding you for progressing the story, even though the story isn't immediately presented to you in an obvious manner. You do need to build the research table asap and research everything you can, as soon as you can, and the game definitely doesn't tell you that. Otherwise, I didn't find myself looking at the wiki a bunch or watching videos on the game to try and figure out what I was supposed to be doing.
The story is fairly short right now. However, each stage/location of the story is pretty interesting as far as lore, and level design. Each level can definitely take some time to complete, especially on your first playthrough, so it's not like you'll just blaze through all the content in just a few hours and have nothing left to do.
The only drawbacks are gathering materials can be tedious at times, and I definitely feel the hunger and thirst mechanics are ridiculous. No one should ever have to eat or drink that much, that frequently, to just survive. It does get a bit easier once you have the ability to make proper meals but even then it's still bad enough that it interferes with my enjoyment of the game. Otherwise it's a pretty good game, for a reasonable price."
16757,good game when you play with friends.
16758,damn shark
16759,I LOVE BRUCE!
16760,"Raft is an endless sandbox that I never get tired of. Every new update, I get reinvigorated to play for another 20 hours at least. I love playing this game with my friends and have dragged as many people as I could into playing it with me. I hope that everyone is able to give this game a try, because it's brought me so so SO much fun!"
16761,"Game is a little slow, takes a ton of time to progress, but once you get somewhere it feels good. The sharks suck ass though because they kind of eat your ship, and plus it’s really hard to get materials and stuff to rebuild it early game

Kind of got bored and demotivated after I died and my ship got eaten. But it’s still a good game

5/10"
16762,"Relaxing, new update makes  it so u can build ships that don't look like a penis"
16763,"Fun with friends.
It's easy to start and hard to be a master
Build a house and turn the house into a castle and kill the shark at least 50 times
Highly recommend"
16764,"Game is really fun, it has it's issues and if your playing on a laptop you are going to have to have good settings (game) and at least 50 gb of ram. By yourself its ok but with friends it can be even more fun but it can be crazy"
16765,"I purchased this game before it was even a real game, back in the early demo days. I have sunk so much time and I am simply waiting for this final chapter to come out! I'm very excited for it and I have been holding onto my review for when that day finally happens, but I have decided to write this now. It's 13 June 22 and I frigging LOVE this game! It has a lot of great balance and movement, the art style it's in is so cute and calming when you're enjoying it! Bruce is, of course, pretty terrifying (I'm also pretty certain they made him BIGGER)!
If I had any complaints, it is that I've been waiting 5 years for the full release of this game (but also, considering how long it can take to build a game, I'm not super surprised and not all that upset), and that when you do get knocked out, any items you had on you are simply gone. I do wish that they would do something like make everything pop out of you like a pinata, especially since they use little boxes for stuff you've personally dropped out of your inventory. As of right now, it all just vanishes and if you had it, it's gone now.
Creative mode is fun but you don't get to go anywhere, which I do wish you could do. Go places and explore without worry for health or food, still catch animals, collect stuff, whatever, it'd be fun.
Easy mode is pretty easy, Bruce doesn't hit as hard and you don't loose your stuff, and you don't have to eat as frequently, though I do wish Bruce was gone for longer moments, lol.
Normal mode is more difficult alone than you'd think, and it took me a while to get a game going where, now, if I die, and loose everything in my pockets, it's not going to be so devastating.
Hard Mode, I haven't really played it. I'm here for a good time, not a hard time, lol. But I do want to play a round of Hard with some friends and see how that goes.
Overall, very good, I'm really looking forward to the update! I'll update you again after it's been released! <3
8/10 So much good, a little that needs to be fixed, and I've had to wait a long time for Chapter 3! But it's coming!"
16766,it very fun you do die a lot aand i dint like how you lose your loot after deth

16781,This game is amazing. If this game will be kept alive with new updates regularly then it’ll evolve into a masterpiece - more than it already is.
16782,"This new update was not worth the wait at all and i would have rather it just not come out, new POI are very boring, the stuff that you get for upgrades are good for what? the story is done and you are just coasting now yahoooo nothing better no reason to play, the voice acting who cares, this feels like a cash grab and its literally a free update sooooo i guess play if you wanna be disappointed. update 1/10 garbage content, not worth the wait like i said."
16783,this is good but that shark its scared me
16784,"I've enjoyed over 700 hours in this game, and can say that if it gets old, start a new game, try a different difficulty, design new rafts, set new goals. It doesn't stop being fun!"

16792,"Absolutely loving this game is not enough to fully describe how much I actually LOVE this game. I haven't been so hooked on a game I've been playing on my own for a very long time (can be played single or in co op). I've just finished the story after 145+ hrs of game play (doesn't actually take that long to complete the story) and now happy to just float around seeking out more decorations for my raft until chapter 3 comes out.

Only thing I would say is a down side is when you're taking down a wall and have completely forgotten about the storage box hanging on its other side and it gets completely destroyed and all its rare content that I can no longer get (at least until chapter 3) disappears, I just wanted to ball up and cry. I thought my only saving grace was to exit the game and restart from last saved check point (which was 6 hours prior), but after rebooting the game up, I realised my banana and strawberry seeds were forever gone *Insert loud crying sounds here*.

Aside from all that, this game has been amazing.

Eagerly waiting for Chapter 3,

Your biggest fan."
16793,Great game really fun
16794,"this is a awesome game it has great quality and has endless fun
"
16795,my hate for screechers is immeasurable
16796,"I'll avoid the long review and just say why I like this game so much... 

Take any base building game. The creativeness. The leveling up, unlocking, and such and make you main (and only base) go with you everywhere!

Contrast with: 
Valhiem - this base is just the base to get the main material from this area until I'm ready to haul it to my real base.
Minecraft - You see this base? Pretty cool, but I'm out of resources here and it is too annoying to relocate. So I'll make a mini base here after some portals, and eventually I'll forget about my big base.

But Raft... it always goes with you. Everywhere. Your chest area? Always with you. Your animals, farms, trees, yep, always with you. 

There is a light story element, which would be way cooler if there was more islands of significance more often. With the final chapter coming out very soon, can't wait to finish out the story and drift forever...

Is it worth it? Yeah."

I hate having to vote no but, the game seems to be dead.  January 2022 was the last message board update and the most ""recent"" update was even earlier than that and simply added painting your walls and what not.  Shame because there is a super fun game present and left me wanting so much more :("

16846,"PREFACE: Don't read this review. Play the game, and do it with at least 1 other person. This is the best way to experience it, IMO.

--------------------

Having previously played the prototype, I thought I knew what to expect from this game; a sandbox survival simulator that takes place on a raft.

I boot it up and invite my friend onto my raft. I lag and hop onto an island and nearly get killed by a wild boar.

Months later, with a new computer, I boot it up and invite my girlfriend to join me. We're both total noobs and we love sandbox games, so I figured it'd be fun!

We start off collecting things around us, placing nets, expanding, the whole shabang. We land on the occasional island, then find a monster of an island with a little watery enclave to enter through. Then we get killed by a wild boar. Cool!

We screw around a bit, then, hey what's this radar thing? And there's another raft in the distance, and—oh. Oh holy sh**. Oh, M.S.Y. Giraffe (that's what we called our raft), we're really in it now.

I don't want to spoil anything. I recommend going into this game blind, alongside a friend or partner. This game, for all its issues, will leave your jaw dropped. It is gorgeous and unique and clever and goddammit we're out of planks again.

Maybe my paintbrush doesn't always work, maybe in the high tide I can clip into an island, maybe sometimes the shark doesn't actually give any damage. This game is still early access, but it's so damn promising and alluring already. You're in awe of the complex structures shown off elsewhere and next thing you know you've built a greenhouse. Each progression in the game is natural and fascinating, whatever form it takes. Even if that progression is anOTHER F***ING SEAGULL JEEZ GET AWAY FROM MY CROPS—

Er. Yeah. It's a good game. Play it, and always remember to collect more planks than you think you need."
16847,Great game for 10 and up.

TLDR: I will die in three (3) days.

16858,yes
16859,IIT IS FUN
16860,"awesome game really fun 



"
16861,Raft is a very grinding game but so enjoyable and really fun to play alone and with friends. The best part is that  its so adventures and your never done there is always more to do and explore the world of Raft. I would highly recommend this game.
16862,"Fun game play and requires attention and thinking ahead. Also helps with good management skills. Do wish updates would come out sooner, but every time they do they are worth it. Would like to see some shark prevention blocks, like spikes or something than dissuade the shark for a short time."

16883,This game is amazing. It's a fun survival based game similar to Minecraft but on an infinite ocean. Overall I give this 7.5 on the story and 9.5 on the gameplay. Great game.

16890,vedy good... quite lone doh
16891,Surviving on the seas is the easy part. Convincing your friends which chests to put their items in is the hard part.
16892,"good game bro
"
16893,building/survival game is an awesome little (not so little )  way to spend the afternoon  the only draw back is the inability ti design your own character ....other than that it's am awesome little (not so little )  game
16894,WATCH OUT FOR CARL THE SHARK
16895,"First of all let me say that the concept of this game is wonderful and visually it is beautiful, but add me to the camp of people who desperately WANTED to like this game. I think with added controller support - and there is none - would make this game much more enjoyable. I have played many games with a keyboard and mouse, but this one just seems counter-intuitive. Switching between items and tools quickly is essential and while there are hot keys for doing this, both of my hands are usually engaged otherwise. So you can use the mouse wheel to the same effect, but this is clumsy and poorly executed. 

Now as far as game mechanics, there seems to be a lot of wasted opportunity. The shark, [spoiler]the major enemy when you start the game, is programmed to attack you every five minutes.[/spoiler] When you START YOU ARE GIVEN A FOUR SQUARE RAFT, A HOOK, AND NO TUTORIAL.[spoiler] The first shark attack comes five minutes in - before you have learned how to play, or how to build tools and weapons to defend yourself. This means you are likely to lose at least one or two squares of your raft pretty quickly. The shark destroys your raft.[/spoiler] Wood is a prime commodity, especially at the beginning, so constantly losing it to repairing parts of the boat you already spent resources to build is very defeating. There are beautiful islands to explore, but there isn't really anything of use on them until you are far enough along in the game to need to worry about the aesthetic of your craft, assuming you keep the shark from eating it long enough to build something worthwhile. 

Overall, this game was frustrating and disappointing. I loved games like Stranded Deep, Green Hell, Windbound, etc; all games that lead me here, but this was sadly disappointing."
16896,good game
16897,"Nice and fun game, if you have friends :P"
16898,"An amazing game and I cant wait to see what happens to it in the future


edit: Version 1 is out now and it is even better than before"
16899,Haven't gotten to the first island 10/10
16900,Very fun survival game with good underlaying story elements.
16901,I'm trying to build a raft. But I'm dummy thicc. And the clap of my asscheeks keeps alerting the sharks.
16902,GOOD YES
16903,very good game would reccomend
16904,"hay una balsa en el medio del mar que un indigena ocupa de forma ilegal, la balsa malvinas hay q defender (?"
16905,"DO NOT BUY. 
Another early access game where the developers took the money and ran."
16906,nice game
16907,"it good

16908,Great with friends
16909,Good Drink👍
16910,"Really cool survival game. Lots of fun, lots to do. Want to farm - you can do that. Want a killer kitchen? Make one. Want to kill sharks and eat shark steaks? You can do that too."
16911,love it very relaxing
16912,"Early Access game that hasn't had an update in over a year...extremely disappointing to be honest.

Every single time I buy early access I get burned by devs jumping ship before the game is release ready. It seems like this might end the same way.

Hope I am wrong because it has potential but damn, it isn't looking good."
16913,"theres water in the game

you need the game to live"
16914,fun

16916,smells like salt water
16917,cool
16918,Waiting for ep3~
16919,Failed the first time so I restarted. So far it has been fun playing this game. Collecting all the Items is a task but it feels rewarding when you do craft that one thing you can't fucking get.
16920,"Love this game, I can chill with all my friends and play at our own pace, Has a great lore but it doesn't happen too quickly so people can join at different stages"
16921,"This game is off to a great start! Here are my personal pros, cons, and things I'd like to see.

Pros: I love the concept in general, I love games that take their time and don't rush you from one point to another and where you can just sit back and breathe and appreciate the design sometimes, and games that encourage you to be creative and design things yourself. 

The way you start seeing what happened to the world through clippings and stories that would be easy to overlook in a lot of cases, and are realistically placed and feel very human is great! It really feels like you're just a person who happened to survive when it hit the fan and now you're trying to pick up what pieces you can to make it through. 

It is very satisfying to kill the shark.

Cons: In third person view, the way your character runs is *WEIRD* and honestly made me feel motionsick, even with the motionsickness mode activated. They don't so much run as wobble like a drunk goose. 

The roofing system is a pain. It seems like to actually cover a large area, you have to keep building the roof further and further upward - the flat roof pieces won't hold each other up and must be supported by the tall slanted ones - meaning you have to figure out a way to keep building upwards if you want to cover a large space and have your raft roof insanely high. A way to have a lower roof structure without the need of using flooring supported by more and more columns would be nice so you can have much flatter, lower roofs covering a wide space if you like.

Speaking of flooring, the constant need for columns to support every two squares makes the floorspace much more limited and crowded. It'd be nice if you could put maybe four support beams or walls on the edges, and have the floor squares supported by each other, or maybe even have a system of crossbeams going between the vertical beams to hold the floors up for larger spaces. Even in smaller rooms I have been unable to create fully floored ceilings with a room above without placing a support column in the middle, which just invades the space and makes it harder to arrange furniture. 

Islands with unique items (such as shipwreck island) should appear on your radar, I think, preferably with a uniquely colored dot rather than the standard green, perhaps red to make it different from the quest spots, or a slightly darker green so it's not PAINFULLY obvious but noticeable that it's an important place to visit. 

I'd like more frequent decoration package drops, and a way of preventing repeated items. It took me FOREVER to get a sofa package when I'd already gotten six shark dinner recipes and the same chair four times. 

Maybe getting more seeds from harvesting plants, or getting seeds when consuming fruits? 
The sprinklers don't cover a very large area, and the pipes for them take up a lot of space and can be difficult to arrange in a useful way, especially if you have to have the sprinkler pointing a certain way (you cannot rotate the sprinkler head, just the main body apparently) to work.

The scarecrows often don't work, I've had gulls take out my plants while the scarecrows are still intact several times. 

Having a roof doesn't seem to stop rain, or sometimes those birds that drop rocks on you. 

Things I would like to see: 

More animals and variations on animals! Maybe the ability to breed for unique colors? 

More fruits/vegetables/trees to grow, and more recipes using such! GIMME SOME TOMATOES! 

Finding canned food, whether by fishing or in barrels or crates or whatnot, could be neat and open up a lot of new recipes, and they'd have both food and water content. 

A little more character customization would be nice, like making and dyeing clothes with wool and the flowers. 

Bowls being re-usable after being used for soup or whatnot. It's not like you're eating the clay bowl along with the meal, right? .....Are you? Please don't do that. Clay can be a good facemask or something but they are for external use ONLY. 

Maybe a companion animal that can accompany you places, help with hunting or gathering items? Like a parrot that can help reach things on high ledges or slow down those birds that drop rocks on you so they're easier to shoot, a dog that can help find and dig up treasures and help with hunting, maybe a cat that sometimes snatches fish out of the water or can help keep seagulls away from your crops, things like that. You'd benefit greatly from having a companion but you'd also need to feed and care for them much like the other tamed animals to keep them healthy - they wouldn't DIE (preferably) if they were left unfed, but maybe wouldn't help you with things. If not a dog, maybe a small pig? A lot of islands have native pig species and pigs are very smart and have fantastic senses of smell stronger than that of a dog, which is why they were used for truffle hunting (and still are sometimes, though most truffle hunters prefer dogs now because the dogs won't eat the truffles they find) so they could be good for helping find treasures! 

I haven't really encountered any weather I'd consider stormy. When the big waves scenario happens, it'd be cool if there was heavier rain, more lightning and thunder effects to make it more of a real at sea storm.

CRABS. That is all. 

An anchor control that you can easily use from where you set up your wheel and the engine controls would be nice, so you don't have to run down from wherever you've got your controls to set it. 

I think it'd be funny if you could have a little aquarium with a betta or something on it. Bettas are freshwater fish so maybe you'd find one in a freshwater puddle on an island? Just being on the ocean surrounded by fish but this *one* fish is SPECIAL DARNIT. Not in a bowl or vase, though, those SUCK.  A proper rectangular tank, maybe with it's own stand, or a few variations of tank you can move your fish to. 

The ability to salvage stuff you find on islands or on the main islands would be cool, like taking a bed you find from the cruise ship or other furniture or art off the walls. 

Overall the game is really good so far and I've been enjoying the heck out of it, and I'm really happy I found it through Press Start to Laugh's videos (which are snort your drink through your nose funny, by the way! He and his wife owe me a new keyboard.) and I look forward to seeing how it develops!"
16922,bird targetted my friend it was very sad bro that bird had it out for him rip brozo.
16923,"no question it's an amazing game. I'm sure you've seen a video of someone playing this game, and it's as fun as it looks! it's simply an amazing game."
16924,"Can't really recommend it at this point. Feels far too grindy compared to other survival games like Grounded and The Forest. Durability of equipment too low, crafting in general requires too many materials, and gathering constantly feels repetitive, like you're going back for more of the same stuff you've already gathered tons of.

I suggest adding support for mods and stuff to be able to tweak those values, or adding some modifiers in the game itself or something.

Otherwise, I enjoyed the game a lot before I got burnt out from the grind."
16925,i the best i  would  recommend it tooo aalll  of  you  players
16926,Fun
16927,Its very fun with friends if you want to make it hard play by your self over all very good game
16928,"Awesome survival game, loved every second of the 30 hours I have in this game. So much to do and there is a lot of freedom with what you can build and lots of different mechanics in the game as well. Also has a bit of story and driving factors to make you progress. 10/10 game"
16929,"super fun just not at first, died a lot in the beginning
"
16930,its good
16931,it is good survival and story
16932,It has good graphics and fun gameplay but i think it needs to allow you to explore in creative

16938,"It is a very interesting game, with great story and lore."
16939,Fun game but don't ever have a power outage while playing it because you'll never get it to launch again...
16940,I made a Bran :)
16941,From the time that i have played raft i can tell it is a good survival game but better on multiplayer than on singleplayer.
16942,"it's good
"
16943,really catchy and great storyline
16944,yes
16945,oh the misery
16946,"Needs more than just a bit optimization.
The performance is so utterly bad, especially in multiplayer, that the game is practically unplayable at times. When just floating on the sea the performance is alright, around 40fps. But when I get close to big islands it drops down to about 20fps in singleplayer and about 8 in multiplayer. With big story islands like Varuna Point it's even worse. Here it drops down to about 2-3 fps in both single and multiplayer. Wouldn't call that playable. The performance wasn't particularly good before the 1.0 update but the full release worsened it quite a bit from about 40fps on big and story islands (in singleplayer as well as multiplayer) before.

16954,"This game has truly taught me the very important lesson that this could be our world if we don't do something about climate change. So to prepare I always throw my trash into the ocean so that I will have enough materials to survive on my raft.

16979,It's a fun game and passes time quick!!!
16980,its fun to play with people
16981,"I've been playing for many hours with my friends and I think it's the perfect team building game to play. Me and my friends have spent hours building homes in creative and easy, collecting all the materials, etc. If you're looking at this review right now, you should get it! Both creative and easy (survival) are so much fun and the devs of this game have made it so much fun."
16982,E
16983,1 of the best survival multiplayer games.
16984,"Playing in relaxed mode and it's extremely zen and calming. Really a great game. Only problem was to figure out some things how to do them and such, like research or finding clay. I'm sure there are tutorials somewhere online or whatever, but I like to play games with as little outside help as possible."
16985,"Right out the gate, I will say that I have really enjoyed this game every time I've played. 

That being said, the multiplayer gameplay is kind of busted. While playing with my husband, almost every time we played on his raft, I would open a chest and it would glitch, making it so that we had to fully log off because it made the glitched chest inaccessible and made it to where I could not open any other chests. 

We also had a goat just disappear from inside a corral, and we never did find out what happened to it. 

This game is really fun, just beware, it's a little buggy."
16986,"The soundtrack for this game is simply beyond words. It gives me the feeling of a deep loneliness and isolation, like there is nothing and no one out there. It makes me feel like it is up to me to make my own decisions in the empty wasteland. If I screw up, that's the end. No going back, no redoing what's been done. And yet, there is a deep tranquility in the music, assuring me that I would make it, if only I surrendered to the water's will. 

The music is simply astounding, and breathtakingly beautiful. The soundtrack alone is worth the price.

Oh, and the gameplay's okay."
16987,"It's a very calming game to play with your games. What's unique about it is that you can't just stand still and afk, you have to keep moving."
16988,amazing.
16989,"Early Access for more than 4 years and not alot of new content and improvement. According to the frequency of game updates, the devs are very sloppy and/or not interested in this game anymore. Not recommended for now. Sorry."
16990,"yes
"
16991,"Good game, amazing concept, shit ending"
16992,It is a fun game with good story line and missiones
16993,good game
16994,yes very fun game
16995,"This game is really fun, my brother and I have been having a blast with it. My only complaint is the shark. I think the idea of a shark is fun--but this shark never leaves! It's constantly there which makes it really difficult to enjoy exploring and collecting. I know there is a peaceful mode that makes it so the sharks and boars aren't a threat--but I still want some threat, just not CONSTANT. Other than the shark and a few bugs though, this game is super fun and I can't wait to keep playing it."
16996,"THIS GAME IS AMAZING
"
16997,wda
16998,fun
16999,this has reignited the relationship with me and my father
17000,there's a boat
17001,EVRYTHING
17002,Early access means the game is in a playable state with a decent amount of content. I did everything the game offered in 30 hours. Updates are still being launched and selling someone a game that has almost no content or build options is basically selling someone something that you didn't do yet and you seem to have no intention of finishing. I feel very disinclined to buy another game from these developers.
17003,Good game i reccomend if you like sharks
17004,Super chill and relaxing game. 100% recommend. shark can be annoying. if you play single player you have to select no one can join to be able to pause. Items vanish if you die singleplayer if you arent on easy mode which can be annoying. got my first set of metal gear and died before i even got to use it. Kinda wish shark had a longer respawn timer so you could kill and chill for a day or 2 game time without being harassed.
17005,Most underrated game on earth
17006,BOOD
17007,Shark ate my boat so I killed shark. Tbh pretty good.
17008,ITS GOOD.
17009,"Very funny, but if you are scared of deep waters be careful"
17010,Can play for hours without noticing. Balances all the best parts of survival games w/ chill combat (for the most part). Probably my fave of the genre.
17011,One of my fvorate games to play with my wife and our friends. I can not wait to see what you guys come up with next.
17012,Not a great game. Do not love the style or survival mechanics. Can wait to see it fleshed out.
17013,"Great Game, Love the style, and survival mechanics. Can't wait to see it fleshed out."

17035,"This game is very addicting and very good. The amount of customization available is surprising, and you modify your raft as much as you want. The storyline is excellent, and it takes a decent amount of time to complete, even in multiplayer. Although a great game in graphics can have many bugs in actual game play, and raft is no exception. Sometimes, items fall through the raft, mobs glitch including the shark, and I and my friend even found a game-breaking glitch that allows you to get infinite structures that you can use. (Sofas, beds, hammocks, and more game-breaking ones like biofuel refiners.) Even though these glitches are bad, they don't ruin this game. Easy 5/5 for me."
17036,"It's a really relaxing survival game with a storyline. Although it's not 100% complete, it doesn't really matter as traversing though the infinite ocean, after you've finished the storyline, doesn't get repetitive :)"

17068,"overall very fun, pretty relaxing game

only thing that gets on my nerves is Bessie the Shark
Yes i named her...
Yes she hunts way to often
Yes she has a million hit points
Yes she is the only consistent company in the game (when you are a solo player)

Jokes aside... i like the shark mechanic. But i find Bessie really frustrating. I play on easy so im never worried about Bessie biting too hard, BUT the fact that bessie never leaves is kinda frustrating. It slows down gameplay drastically, specially for new players.
i recommend that Bessie be another Island boss, in such that Bessie only spawns every X amount for each island visited (scaling with difficulty) and also spawns if a player spends too much time in water, again scaling with difficulty. I also feel strongly that if you kill Bessie (RIP) there be a longer cooldown tell Bessie 2.0 respawns. Its a little absurd and frustrating to take the time to make shark bait to carefully kill BB just to have another one spawn in less than two minutes.

As well as that, and i dont have as much as an issue with this because it keeps the game fun, but, Island bosses are TANKY. It makes the engagements fun but really annoying if they are resource intensive I.E Bows & arrows, Spears, ECT... 

Overall, Id rate the game 4 out of 5 Bessies.
And will be recommending to friends"

17092,"This game is an invigorating experience of what life on a raft in a dystopian universe is like. Unfortunately, that means it is boring as hell. It is the same type of and therefore vastly inferior to games like Minecraft Subnautica that actually either have content or receive constant updates. The lack of content shows and hopefully the last chapter will address that but as you can see I have as of writing 3 hours on the game and I have completed it. Your money would be better spent gambling because then at least you can blame an addiction as to why you waste money."

The arrows fire too slowly and you can never lead your target or understand where the arrow is going to go.....that blasted bird always has the upper hand. Archery was obviously a huge oversight and the arrow speed needs to be improved to match the speed of the enemy you are firing it at."

17154,"It's laggy on some computers, but a lot of fun!"
17155,"I don't normally purchase or play titles in Early Access, especially titles in that status for 4+ years. The exception to the rule here came from a friend who wanted to play a co-op survival game that was new to all of us. In this particular case, friends > principles. ;-)

Survival-lite with a distinct aesthetic and neat water graphics. Possibly more aggravating than amusing in single player, it was more entertaining than challenging for three players. At this stage of development, the mystique seems to wear off ~4-ish hours in. That's not to say it's boring or tedious after said interval, only that if you'll have discovered most (possibly all) of the macro-levels of engagement. More world-building (such as you could have in a survival game) would have helped, as would additional forms of danger while at sea (e.g., rough seas being able to damage the raft or push people into the water). I appreciate that not every player may want such an escalation of danger, but at least presenting options for such an approach could go a long way toward maintaining a real sense of (haha) immersion. 

At this stage of development, ""Raft"" is a 'recommend' for whenever it makes 'release'-level status, at least for those seeking a non-demanding co-op survival game that will keep them interested for a few hours. There are plenty of ways for the game to grow, e.g., include more levels of challenge, develop the world, offer strengths and weaknesses for different characters, etc, and I hope Redbeet Interactive opts to include or lean in on some of these options. Should they do so, ""Raft"" would be an easy recommend to everyone looking for a good co-op experience.

17167,"~ Brief Review ~
1) Do not recommend solo-play, multiplayer HIGHLY recommended. 
2) Graphics are cute and colorful, though I have a potato PC and it struggles to keep up even on the lowest graphics.
3) Game feels empty if you don't have a companion to keep you company.
4) G o a t s .
5) Soundtrack can be calming, even when death is on your doorstep.
6) Recommended for people who can tolerate dying insensibly.
7) Is relatively grindy, but its a survival game, so that's expected. ( Feels rewarding in Raft, though. )

~ Extended Review ~

   Bought this game for me and my husband-- we both really enjoy multiplayer survival games, and Raft definitely falls under that category. If you're playing multiplayer, the game feels way more fun than it actually is, purely due to the company. If you're looking for a game that can satisfy a solo players boredom, you're looking in the wrong place. I played 2 hours by myself, and the other 5 with my husband. In comparison, the 2 hours spent alone felt redundant and INCREDIBLY tedious-- materials were a lot harder to gather, expanding your Raft takes significantly longer, and the game feels noticeably empty without another player. Honestly makes the game feel stressful when you're desperately trying to collect materials and advance the plot. 

   On the flip side of that, now for the slightly better news, playing multiplayer is beyond entertaining. The 5 hours I had spent on multiplayer went by way too fast, and I really enjoyed the game once it felt like it was possible to make significant progress. A lot of aspects of Raft would feel awfully dull without the addition of a companion, but with a friend things go a lot easier and Raft actually feels like a fun time. 

   Honestly, the game itself doesn't really have any jaw-dropping characteristics, but it is neat for a period of time. You get to explore and loot islands, start from ground zero and make a personalized home on the waves, and have fun while literally dying trying to get a single mango off an island. The game also has hunger, thirst, natural predators, progress based crafting, SUBTLE plot, and small little surprises every now and then."

17174,"Fun game to play with friends, I am excited for them to add more of the story line."
17175,"This game should not be in early access! Not because its done poorly but the opposite, Its in good shape. This developer could say I'm done not make another change and it is better than many released games I've played lately. You wouldn't feel like you wasted money on this game as its just receiving polish, adds, and flavor."
17176,"It seems like you'll be waiting endlessly for a conclusion to this game. Maybe in 5 years I'll give this a recommend. Let's see, it's 6/5/22 and their last announcement related to development was 1/13/22 which was some stills and scratch drawings. Loved this game initially playing with my buds, but sadly we'll be waiting forever.

It's like the dev team jumped ship only we consumers were the ones the shark went after.

I've been playing with my fiancee and I think we finally got a good raft going as we sail the open seas (or drift in the direction the current is taking us). Bruce the 24th is not nice but we took care of his grandfathers before him no problem. Our llama's Larry, Lana, and Reginald seem to be doing fine and not getting sea sick as I thought I would imagine. Billy our black goat keeps them company. We have yet to find a chicken to join our army of animals."
17211,"After watching several videos of this game, a friend and I decided to get it and try to play together. The difficulty levels are very balanced-- No matter what amount of challenge you're looking for, you'll find it. It's also fun to play both solo and multiplayer, though on the bigger islands you'll be glad if you have a buddy who has your back. Now if I could just hire an organizer for my storage..."

17260,"Exactly what a chill, stable, good quality game can and should be. Better/ controller support would be appreciated, but it works without just takes more time to setup."
17261,amazing game to play with friends.
17262,very cool
17263,good
17264,Liking the game so far. My sister and I played for 6 hours. No real complaints.

17273,"I like the concept and execution of the idea - although i haven't gotten to the end, the game is very fun. Singleplayer provides a harder experience with it also being more difficult to get enough resources. Multiplayer provides a easier experience as in-water gathering is easier - one player can distract the shark and the other gets resources. However, i do not like how grindy it is - especially with plastic as after you get an axe then planks become trivial. Overall, this game is great! I would definitely recommend buying it."
17274,very fun game especcially with friends
17275,"fun. especially with friends.
and very relaxing. even has a more easy mode if you just want to focuse on your raft building."
17276,"Got gifted this by a friend so I could play with them, had a blast... and then steam took it away from me because why not... so great game, not so great time."
17277,relaxing game with other people
17278,Super fun solo or with friends. I feel like the inventory and crafting menus need a little bit of work but they are currently usable. The devs are working on big changes (chapter 3) and I'm eagerly waiting for it!

17288,"It's fun, but stressful when you're playing alone or in normal mode. If you die, you won't get your things back (in that mode). When playing with other people, it's easier and more entertaining! Especially in easy mode, where you're belongings stay even if you die. There is peaceful mode if you want to enjoy the experience without predators, and creative if you don't want to work for things, but easy mode is my favorite! Totally recommend."

17300,fuck that dumbass shark
17301,"The game mechanics themselves are pretty fun, and the story feels fresh when you figure out how to solve the little puzzles and whatnot. There is going to be a story overhaul in the next update so we'll see how it goes. I'm looking forward to seeing the changes. 

This game isn't super intense and if you play it with the goal of blowing through the story I think you'll miss out on a lot of the charm it has. Sit back and enjoy a fruit compote, watch the whales swim by, yell at Bruce maybe."

You will repeat the same thing everytime: find a new island, get boring stuff and if you are lucky you might find something that will build something different.

17319,it's ok ig
17320,"A very fun water-based survival game. It'll definitely keep you busy for hours on end as you build up your raft while maintaining your survival setup and following the game's storyline. I highly recommend you play it with a group of friends, though. The game is kind of built around having a crew to manage your raft, and it's pretty cool how they do that. But you'll have plenty of fun playing it solo as well. If you can get some friends to play with you, though, it'll be a blast."

17366,"Been playing this since the Early Access and got all the way to the end with some friends. Honestly, I wouldn't have paid for this. It's boring, repetitive, and an overall grind--- not even the fun type of grind either, but just an aimless one. The 'content' update was just a quick way for them to get this game off their hands--- the boss fights were pretty lame and over too fast to even be called 'bosses'. Endgame puzzles were nothing more than fetch quests from one end of the island to the other. The voice lines weren't even really necessary either, just something that seemed tacked on to make it look like there was more to the update than there was. We all waited more than a year for an hour worth of mediocre game play.

In short, if you want a meaningless grind floating around on the ocean waiting for the same copy pasta island, go ahead and get this game. Otherwise, go spend your $$ on something that has more to offer."

17385,"Have someone to play with? Then get this game.

You begin on a tiny raft and must collect pieces of scrap from the ocean, all while you while hold back a shark from biting off pieces of your ship (or you). This isn't the only issue, because you're starting to feel thirsty and hungry. In order to live you must expand your raft and stave off the unforgiving seas and show her you're not going down without a fight. Build a garden, fish, collect from islands, after a while you become self-sustainable, but not without hardship. 

There are numerous missions you can follow in this game. When you setup an antenna array, you'll be able to find secret locations that offer amazing exploration and goodies which you wouldn't find otherwise. These are some truly unique adventures, and I admittedly (and sadly) went through them rather quick. Explore huge islands, collect bees, fight bears, navigate your way through the dark corridors of shipwrecks while staying close to your shipmate for safety. Very few survival games offer such a memorable experience. The devs have said they plan to release more which I'm thrilled to hear about.

You're high up on the steering tower and you're on course towards the next destination of your journey. The engines below churn as you propel forward into the vast, unknown sea. The soundtrack begins and fills that emptiness. The soundtrack is perfect for this game.

There are only a few minor grievances I have with this game. 
- The food system is not good. I should not be eating that much in a day. Sorry, it gets really tiresome and annoying. Water is good however, because people need a lot of water especially under the hot sun.
- Death is kind of dumb in normal difficulty. Why doesn't my stuff remain there where I died? Especially since I had a backpack.
- The shark should have an random respawn time. It would make it less predictable, and you wold have to take your chances on whether you have time to go off your raft.

Overall, great game. Highly recommend."
17386,i love raft
17387,its a very fun game ive been wanting to play it for a while

I have played many more survival games that have been a lot more fun even with the grind."

[h1]About the game.[/h1]

Raft is a game where ""relaxing"" is taking to a whole new level. The game is soo relaxing, it will be even boring or you may even get tired of it and could nap away. You start up on a small raft with a single hook. You are throwing the hook to the scattered items on the ocean and from there you are expanding your raft.

A shark will attack your raft from time to time and while in the early game he can be problematic, mid to late game he is becoming more of an annoyance than being a problem. You are able to kill the shark and grab his meat which you can cook to get a nice boost of food and you are able to grab the stuff on the ocean without harm until he does respawn back.
In the early game your raft will be blown with the wind and you can grab goodies on your way. If you have made an anchor you could use this anchor to stop your raft which can be useful if you are bypassing nearby islands to explore. Islands are somewhat random and if you are unlucky to be on an island, you will have to wait until you will bypass a new island.

This could be problematic as well as you may not have resources for an anchor, the island is too dangerous to reach or the raft is not close enough to be worth the trip. Furthermore some islands have nothing of useful and you will be wasting more time than getting a gain out of it.
Roughly said, you will bypass an island every 15-30 minutes and if you have nothing to do(lack of resources).. well i do hope you will enjoy your stay until you have found a new island. So the game is more of a waiting game than a survival game in my opinion.

As you do progress you will be discovering parts and revealing more of the story, step by step, bits by bits. The world design or on islands is pretty dull for the most part and doesn't feel alive at all. Granted it make sense as you are on an island but it's really boring to watch and look around.

While i do love survival games.. this game doesn't have any survival things.. True you do need to drink and eat from time to time, catch and eat fish (bleh), chop wood, expand and upgrade things.. it just doesn't click with me in the survival terms.
The game is truly enjoyable to have some solo-time and play the game without thinking too much about it.. but this game may be more enjoyable to play with friends or not... it could be even easier or de/increasing the boredom.

Combat damage against the shark or other enemies are pretty much a preset.. I mean.. If you are hitting them in the head or body, the damage will be the same. Easy example is with the bow and arrow, if you are shooting an arrow which is not even fully loaded and it just flops instantly down onto the ground and it does hit an enemy.

The damage will be the same as a fully loaded shot. You will only do more damage if you are using better arrows or weapons. Killing enemies with a ""floppy"" arrow is a lot quicker than a fully loaded one but you may put yourself in danger since you have to be in melee range.

The (creative) building system in this game is somewhat limited and not because of the raft size but more of the constant support of structures. In order to have a second floor you will need support from the floor below and while normal buildings can be put anywhere you do want, construction items does not. Walls and pillars can only be placed around a wooden floor (raft) piece, in a strict line and roofs can be placed on top of it. While it is a good idea and make your buildings easy without too much of a hazzle. The roof can't hang too much without needing support from below which usually is a pillar. It does make sense as you are on a raft but it will hinder your movement on the raft with the amount of pillars. The freedom of building isn't there compared to ""The forest"" or 7 days to die. but it honestly looks nicer than in ""The forest"" especially for OCD / perfectionist builders.

[h1]Other things.[/h1]

The game is a 50/50 in my opinion. It is nice, relaxing and the game gets more interesting (in some way) the longer you play and progress but you are combatting a lot against idle time or waiting time. Especially in the early game. The amount of ""dead"" time in this game makes the game in my eyes very uninteresting and i do get bored at times while playing this game. This game is definitely kid friendly as there is ""practically"" no blood and is a good family game in the end. It may not be a good solo game and it could be fun if you play with friends to fill up the dead time together and speed up the game progress. 

The only reason i am playing this game is because i want to know how the story goes and how it does end, but i am currently on Day 113 and 89 hours into the game, i am on my third quest island at the moment and honestly.. i will be very happy to be done with this game and play something else instead.

-------------------

I Give this game a 6/10"
17411,"As a rule I avoid early access games, especially ones in early access for 4 years.

However, I was bored and wanted a solo survival with crafting and decided to get it on sale. 
Great game, the reason for early access is the story is not completed, it will be out this summer.
Had lots of fun, built a decent raft, finished the story as is and waiting for the last part to come out.
Off to other games but will keep installed until I can finish it."
17412,"an amazing game, lots of fun with friends."
17413,You on a raft and shit
17414,"I LOVE this game! I actually have closer to 100 hours played on my husband's account and I could play it forever! If you like resource management and survival games, this one's great. Just make sure that you activate the motion sickness mode if you get motion sick at all, otherwise you won't be able to play for very long."
17415,You have to craft a bowl each time you want to eat soup. Solid logic.
17416,shark scares me
17417,build a boat for treasure
17418,Buy this game during the summer and play in the morning with a friend its the best thing in gaming holy shit I love doing that I can't wait to do that again this summer I recommend it 10/10

17420,yes
17421,nice

17432,"I love this game! Its fun, the graphics are great and the adventure becomes even better when you play with friends.
You can play this game for hours just upgrading your raft, killing sharks and exploring islands.
If you're looking for an easygoing, cooperative and fun game to pass the time - this is a game for you!
I can't wait for the next update so I can continue the adventure and progress in the fun and intriguing story."
17433,"This is kind of chill game... not all the time but ye... I like it...   :]
And I'm hyped for next story update or just an update that add stuff.

17439,good
17440,This game has caused me to develop a hatred towards birds
17441,Fun game. PS: F#$k that shark lol
17442,"Good game, just a shame the content updates are taking so long to get released."
17443,"I don't get the hype. It's a buggy, shallow, unfinished mess. It's like an unfinished school project of unfunny choices, ridiculous developer decisions and ugly models. 

Everything sucks. The garbage hook is made with DARPA level technology to ensure that catching floating plastic is both boring and frustrating at once! What feat of gamery! 

The shark has no chill and literally attacks you the SECOND you hit water, which you need to do for stones in early game. Yaay. No one thought this through.

Everything looks cheap, the building system is so un-intuitive and stupid that it is simply not fun.

17449,"My biggest ""complaint' for Raft is that it doesn't have controller support (yet, hopefully). I prefer to game with a controller cause it's comfortable in my hands and Raft should easily translate to controller. I say that because I love Raft so much but after a short period of time, my hand goes numb from M&K. I was about to immediately write this game off because I played on regular mode and it was just so overwhelming and the shark destroyed my raft (I was panicking the whole time). I gave it another shot on peaceful mode and fell in love. It does make the game easier (possibly too easy) but there's still resource management involved (including eating/drinking). I know it's still early access but it feels full (although I'm really starting to go through the story...which I didn't even realize existed lol) and I can't wait for more additions though I've only barely scratched the surface. I really like Ark and I love using the raft as a mobile base but Ark's raft building system is very limited which is what drew me to Raft. If Raft had dinosaurs, I'd be head over heels lol. I know I had some minor ""complaints""/suggestions (besides controller support) but I struggle to think of them as all I can think of is how awesome Raft is!!!!!!"

17458,so fun
17459,Its a good overall game I think. Its fun to craft and its the best to play with friends
17460,Slow start and overall gameplay flow made me refund the game. Perhaps if it ever fully releases and leaves early access I might give it another try.
17461,this game is soo fun all it needs is a little bit realistic stuff thats all! [very good game i recommend this to other players]
17462,"The concept is really good to me but the raft physics needs to be more realistic. For example:
-It never sinks no matter how much weight is put on a single foundation.
-It never breaks in any case other than being chewed up by sharks.
It takes away the vulnerability factor. 
I built a whole mansion on a single foundation :D
Things float through my raft even in an enclosed space, the roof doesn't stop rain to fall through and water flows through the walls and foundations.
These things really spoil it for me. It gets boring so quickly.
I know it's still in early access but the physics needs to be fixed for the game to feel like as it intends to."
17463,Its so much fun!
17464,"me and my friend got into an argument about the scarecrow. we named him stanley and i was getting angry that stanly was getting constanly beatin up by the birds. so i said move him. but he said the main point of the scare crow was the crops. and i said.""Yeah but stanly is going to constanly get beaten up."""

17474,"Closer to actual work than a game, id honestly rather do my real job than play this anymore. All you do is micromanage the same stuff for the entire game, every step of progress is well earned but its not fun to earn anything. Raft makes every effort to artificially delay and destroy the players progress. Its not balanced for singleplayer and feels like an endless chore list, you will constantly be running around like a madman interacting with the same items, refilling the same workstations, building the same items, for the entire game. it never changes or becomes automated enough to make a real difference. You will collect the same basic resources with the same exact method from start to finish, you will keep crafting the same items to do the same tasks over an over. Even when you get upgrades they still require micro-management and still consume resources over time. Each gameplay mechanic is designed to not only use up some kind of resource or breakable tool, but also keeps you from doing other tasks, preventing you from multitasking. I could list reasons I hate this ""game"" for the next hour but I'm nearly done with the main problems. This was exhausting to play, it demands so much mental energy at every moment.  

Raft pretty demanding on your PC too, near some of the large islands im maxing out a 3080. Its not like the water physics are that great they often don't interact with the raft at all and look terrible at times. The water is odd in some other ways too, during gameplay the seas can become pretty choppy and the raft will move along with the waves. The problem here is that the players water level doesn't change. You can be say 3 feet under a wave unable to swim up because the game THINKS your at the surface, the actual water level doesn't change. This creates more issues when trying to board the raft in choppy water, your getting attacked but the game is preventing me from climbing on my raft because its just poorly programmed.  The movement overall feels awkward and floaty. jumping isn't high enough and you cant grab on the side of the raft so you'll often bounce up in down 5 times before the game decides your allowed back on the raft. The wildlife only serves to impede the player and only presents a threat because you loose 2/3rds of your resources on death. You cant go pick em back up, they get deleted from the game. It also cuts the durability of all tools it doesn't delete in half, usually leaving you with fuck all to worth with. Its just one middle finger after another with this POS excuse for a game. It's a beautiful game to watch but playing solo is exhausting, frustrating, tedious, repetitive. I could go on but I wont, but I could."
17475,"I love this game so much, me and my friend have been playing for a while now and we haven't gotten bored at all. I would definitly recommend this to everyone out this. Its a great game and theres so much to do. In some games u adventually beat it in like a hour or two but this game this a lot to do. You can build your raft and make it better and even explore. There is also a story time which I wont tell about because that would ruin it! I hope you get this game and try it for your self!"

In short, much of what I talk about in earlier versions of the review hold true, however now that the final chapter is released and I've reached the endgame it's time to talk about the 'complete' game such as it is.

Building mechanics have been hugely improved with the inclusion of horizontal supports which allow you to build so very much more with whatever you can imagine.

Sadly, there are three aspects that just don't work at all about this game and because they are linked to progression I can't really recommend the game at full price. First up is the movement system. The devs have included so much annoying platforming that the clunky, imprecise, and unresponsive control system actively stands in the way. A friend who bought the game hated the platforming aspects so much that they gave up on the game entirely. The shame of this is that without the platforming you just cannot progress. I powered through the sections, but they are undoubtedly the lowlights of the game. The system just wasn't designed very well for this. Perhaps a future bigfix will address this, but until it is, the game actively suffers as a result.

Secondly, the boss fights and puzzles. Mostly straightforward when you have solved them, but they're not the most friendly to players who aren't buying into this game for the story or platforming. What I mean by that, is that some players will just want to build out their raft and will skip through all the notes. They will maybe collect them but won't necessarily read them. They're more interested in the blueprints. For those players this is a 'one route' type of game. There is just one route to complete the story, so it expects players to play a certain way. 

Finally, I really wish all game devs would learn not to hide really useful things behind the final boss. Having the titanium tools, and the electronic zipline hidden so late into the game it felt very much 'oh okay, well that's anti-climactic'. Had those blueprints been something cool like a faster engine, or something that would further incentivise building out your raft that might have been better. It's minor gripe though.

In addition to these still stand all my prior thoughts. The building aspect is great. The flexibility of the building is great. Sadly, with so long given to development, the game just feels unpolished. That's a great shame, because there is a real gem here.

---=== The Original Review ===---

I played a version of Raft around about five years ago now before the story stuff started to appear....back on itch.io

Even in Early Access, this is actually a good game. Though I will be clear, if Early Access lasts more than a year for a AAA or three for an indie, I don't cut the game any slack for being in Early Access.  So read my criticisms knowing that.

--== What Works Well ==--

BUILDING & DECORATING
The building of the raft is awesome. Absolutely wonderful. I have managed to build whatever I can imagine and that is something I absolutely adore about a game like this. It wasn't too long before my raft looked more like a ship. So, if you like base building survival games this is a great game to check out for a reasonable price.

PROGRESSION & RESEARCH
I love the idea of having to visit different locations in order to make progress. Researching all the different items you can pick up is as simple as plugging an item in. No tedious wait timers, the limiting factor is that you might sacrifice a valuable item to make progress. It just works well. Visiting new islands initially makes the game feel quite large and helps to feel like you're moving forward. The only downside is how small the world feels when you've seen the same island for what feels like the 10th time around.

SURVIVAL
A lot of survival games make the process of survival an annoyance rather than a resource balancing exercise. Being able to eat while walking makes a massive difference and is a good quality of life thing,

SOCIAL/ONLINE
Being able to simply, quickly and easily join a game with my sister to work together is an advert for how to do co-op building games properly. It's easy and intuitive. The vast majority of the hours put into the game are with other people and I have thoroughly enjoyed it.


--== What Doesn't Work Well ==--

PLATFORMING & MOVEMENT
The story locations require a LOT of platforming. For game that has been built largely around the building aspect it seems very odd that there is a LOT of fiddly platforming. The game engine just doesn't feel built for such movement. There needs to be a much better movement and control system to justify the rather long and tedious platforming areas (Caravan Town for example). Cynical though it makes me, it feels like the developers had an idea for a different game and instead of making a different game rolled it into this one to save money and resources. If progress wasn't locked behind odd platforming areas this wouldn't be an issue.

SMALL WORLD
Once you've got engines for your raft the world begins to feel extremely small. By that point you've probably seen most of the island types many times over which makes the world feel tiny and boring. If the game hadn't been in development for over five years at this point, this would be forgiveable, but with so much extra being added to the game over the last few years it's long past time to add in a greater variety of island types.


--== Is it worth buying? ==--

Yes. If you like building survival games, Raft is well worth the £20. There's an evolving story, and a really good base building mechanic. The co-op mode is utterly entertaining and actually feels like the way the game is meant to be played. Assuming that the devs actually finish off the story, there's still more to come. Given how long it's been in Early Access though, there's always a big red flag. There is a complete game hiding here with very little extra work however, which is why I do recommend it."

17521,fun
17522,"It's fun.  We had fun, but it's short and doesn't have a great tutorial.  I think it's dev-abandoned though.  I swore I would never do early access again, and here I am complaining about not getting a full product...again."
17523,"this is a great game i love solo play but its even better with a few buds killing time chatting away.......   Great replay value as none of my play thru have been the same 
"
17524,"Nice visual, made in a cartoon style. The gameplay is not too varied, but rather measured, throughout the game you will find new items that expand your possibilities for exploring the game world.

17562,Definitely worth it. Somewhere in between chillout fishing and constant survival
17563,Really fun game for what you do. I didn't think just sitting on a raft and collecting flotsam and jetsam as you floated by would be fun. I was wrong! Unlocking new items as you discover/learn new materials is a blast. And there are so many ways to build your raft and play the game.

17576,"TL:DR Terrific game. could use a few improvements but one of the best co-op survival games out there!

Raft is a very enjoyable game, especially with friends. I like it even more than i expected to. Here are some thoughts.

Pros:
-Beautiful handcrafted islands to explore.
-Great story with awesome locations that just get better and better.
-Some of the most fun base building and customization/decoration i have experienced.
-Neat cooking system with ""interactive"" recipes.

Cons:
-Weapon/item wear and hunger/thirst deplete too quickly and are too gimmicky.
-Regular islands are cool but the small number repeats quickly and gets a bit boring.
-Not enough danger. Enemies are far too easily cheesed)
-Camera glitches through ceiling when in third person.
-Some glitches on multiplayer requiring exiting and re-joining (relatively uncommon).

Additions i'd love:
-Make items last longer and add a repair station (slightly expensive but cheaper than making anew).
-Small 1-2 person lifeboat/raft docks for exploration (can anchor main ship and let players explore inlets).
-Add new threats and improve enemy AI (enabling some of them to climb or jump along with running or hiding if they cannot attack you would make combat far more dangerous and satisfying).
-Add randomly generated islands (would add replay value and make exploring more exciting for all!).

Conclusion:
Get it! :D"

17704,Good Survival Game
17705,"Indeed, it is a fun game but keep in mind of the ""Early Access"" label, because it is indeed an unfinished game (no hate, there is plenty of room for updates and growth.)

Combat feels weird and jank. Screechers (the rock-dropping bird) for example will clip through rocks like it's nothing. You can't even cancel drawing a bow. Friendly Fire activated doesn't seem to really work.

However, it is a fun and engaging survival game. It isn't boring and there's a lot of room and liberties given to you."

17713,"Good game, amazing survival aspect with a good amount of difficulty, but little exploitable mechanics, only one or two bugs and a really good storyline based on what little you have in the beginning. Good job, people!"
17714,get it frosty
17715,"Only have 40 hours currently but will definitely be spending more on it, i have finished the current story progression that is available and have thoroughly enjoyed it. the freedom of creativity in this game is great and it has amazing potential, with the 3rd chapter coming very soon."
17716,this game is for dumbasses
17717,Such a relaxing game!

17725,"A Little rough to start, But don't let that turn you away. I was frustrated in the beginning as nothing is explained and I died over and over again. but that's part of being stuck on a raft.... I was late to the party but this game is fantastic, I don't want to spoil... but every time you reach a ""special destination"" there are fun but relatively easy puzzles, exciting places to explore and it really brings your mind off of floating around grabbing resources. I would highly recommend this game!"

17727,good plant. love finding plastic and wood. :)
17728,fish
17729,"This game is great! You explore the world and find islands, all while collecting resources and expanding your raft. You can fight pufferfish, sharks, hogs, etc. and it is great fun! I would recommend playing with a friend, as it adds to the experience. There are also story islands that you will come to, and you get to explore them. This game really is worth the $20!"
17730,Solid game to play with friends and without them has a lot of things to do even in early access

17732,Very fun and entertaining. i sugest playing with a friend
17733,"You can paint the raft, many different colors."
17734,Its not letting me in rocket league
17735,it good and fun for friends to play and mess around on with a  good campaign
17736,"I tend to like gathering/building games. Raft scratches that itch well.
Story line really dragged in the beginning until I got my feet under me. After the first continuation of the story (trying not to spoil here) it's picked up. Hope the pace continues. :)"
17737,great game
17738,Very cool game where your in the ocean and on a raft.
17739,raft
17740,"its still bugey but buuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuut  some bugs are good
"
17741,"This game is honestly addicting, and it is so much fun with friends. I would recommend playing with friends, as it can be a little boring solo, but never the less, it is still a great game and I cannot wait for Chapter 3."
17742,i love this game it would be better if i head friends tho
17743,"While not that deep, it's still fun to design and build a raft of your own. It's trivially easy to progress through the story after the first chapter so if there was more of a challenge like more interesting puzzles then it would feel like a much more fleshed out game. Still fun to sail around with friends and craft."
17744,"Love the survival-craft at sea vibe, can't wait for future updates!"
17745,"This game is only playable with friends, but honestly that makes it just that much more fun. I just wish that either single player mode was a bit easier, or just didn't exist at all."
17746, goog ggod game
17747,"ye.
"
17748,"It is good game yes
"
17749,I love duping items.
17750,"Played on easy and enjoyed the laid back feel of this game on this mode.  Story is a little light at the moment but there is more on the way.  Highly suggest if you are looking for something light and relaxing.  Pick up and put down at a moments notice.  Multi player works well.  Combat is a little wonky, carcass pick up is also needing to be improved, and hook is glitchy sometimes on multi player.  These issues can be worked around with little effort thou."
17751,This is probably the best multiplayer game I have ever played. It is also super fun solo.
17752,"very good open world survival game its really fun!
"
17753,Great game but they need to add sex.
17754,our chicken is dead
17755,This is good stuff
17756,Fantastic game fun to play with buddies not the greatest game alone but still fun
17757,"This game is a lot of fun if you play as intended. The building possibilities seem endless, and I love slowly turning my 4x4 raft into a comfortable home with lots of amenities. It's also a very chill experience once you figure out the basics of staying alive.

There is a lot of ""grindiness"" to the game, and there are certain quality control elements that allow for pretty extreme game-breaking--no doubt a product of the small team of devs with limited opportunities for dedicated software testing. See Let's Game it Out's third installment of this game for an example of the severity of game-breaking opportunities.

I'll add that, having beaten the game already, I use a modded install for all future playthroughs, simply for the opportunity to spawn the blueprints for the titanium tools. I think they should be available during the story component of the game.

17759,Repetative
17760,imagine if there was no bruce ;-;
17761,i named the shark Cronker
17762,"a great game for hanging out with your friends and amazing for building, collecting and hunting to survive, a 10/10 from me for design, the limitless amounts of players able to join, endless creativity and alot of fun for all"
17763,but no updat a
17764,i dont want to!
17765,Bruce
17766,fun game should play

Kill the Shark (Bruce) for good.
"
17774,10 of 10 fun survival game alone but more fun with friends
17775,"I recommend playing with friends, it's still fun without them but it's very stressful and you're constantly having to do something. A very good survival game."
17776,good fun and pretty easy
17777,"very fun with friends
"
17778,Pog
17779,Really fun game! Just waiting on Chapter 3!
17780,"I love this game, when you really get into it, it's super fun and I don't get bored"
17781,"Really fun i enjoy how calm it can be, but I do also love how crazy and chaotic it is :)"
17782,cool
17783,"Almost two years since an actual update. This game is unfinished and the devs have practically abandoned the game. Very sad to see such a promising project left in the dust.

edit: game finished"
17784,I love this game it has so much crafting and building in it and alot of adventure to work through the story line! I enjoyed watching Markiplier play it on his own and when he played it with Bob and Wade. I love all the updated features that they added to it. I got this as a gift from my boyfriend and it was worth the money he spent on it so we can both play it together and with friends. Im currently trying to grt more people to play it because of how much i enjoy plaaying this with family and friends. Great i rate it 10 stars!!!!
17785,"great fun, but even better with friends"
17786,Nice game
17787,"great game whach out for the shark
"
17788,"Fun game play, with friends its even better."
17789,fun
17790,"this is a great game and I've had a lot fun with my friends on this game. Its very easy to connect with friends as well. I love the renovation update as well because now i can make my rafts more like home. The game if definitely worth the money considering how much you can put into it. I got the game for 22 dollars and I've put in more then 100 hours into the game. The graphics are just perfect like not too simple but not to complicated either. I also love the lore of the game its fun to try and figure out even though its not finished. The game isn't that hard too, its difficult but its not so bad where I don't wanna play it however not too easy that it gets boring fast. There's always something to do (expect for like the very end) and its over all enjoyable. None of my rafts have ever looked the same because its maybe I'm playing with a different friend or I have a different idea for my raft. i like that even though its a survival game which can usually have the same idea for every game this one makes it more unique and interesting. Its over all just fun and I couldn't ask for a better game."
17791,8/10 would wear shark as helmet again
17792,This is a good game to play with friends!
17793,"fun game, especially if you play with some friends. Can't wait to see what's next for Raft."

"
17869,"super chill even when you're with your friends or by yourself, great game"
17870,"fun very fun
"
17871,"10/10 :)

Edit: 1.0 release is incredible! I could not recommend this game enough. 
In a group or with friends, you can't go wrong."
17872,"Raft is a very, VERY, slow paced game, almost to a fault. As stated in the title you build a raft, and work to survive on a large ocean. This game can be described in one simple word: [b] Boring. [/b] Not only is the gameplay entirely too slow, but graphics arn't all there either. If this game looked nearly as good as something like subnautica i'd probably brush aside the rough gameplay. Raft also tows the line on what an ""Early access"" game is. Released almost 4 years ago, and having made tons of money, Raft is still an early access game, and IT SHOWS. You'd think after all that time and money the game would be... well... fun.

Theres better games out there than Raft. Maybe check back when its fully released. 2/10"
17873,"Shark? Yes. 
Dying 100s of times to a boar and bird? Also yes."
17874,YES
17875,"I was craving a good survival game that wasn't too horror-focused (which, don't get me wrong, is awesome, but The Forest left me slightly traumatized), and this game REALLY scratched the itch. Excellent hunger and thirst system, and just enough of a challenge for it to be interesting, but not a grueling grind.

There's a few different difficulty levels, making it accessible to even the most casual to the most hardcore players. I'm fairly casual, so I can't speak to the harder levels, but I've played creative, peaceful, easy, and normal, and each one has been great. Normal provides challenging mob combat, but it's not too rough for a casual player like myself, and easy is the same without inventory loss on death, which I really appreciate. I've ultimately played the most on peaceful, just because the ocean freaks me the heck out and I like to be able to swim around without getting chomped by Bruce!

Raft building is awesome - not too much of a grind for materials, easy snapping pieces, and lots of room for creativity. I love that you can make your raft both functional and beautiful, as there are tons of decor options, including painting. Playing around on creative is a lot of fun.

The story has been really intriguing so far. I haven't discovered all there is to offer, but what I have found has me itching for more. Again, uncovering new parts of the story is a fun challenge without being too difficult or grindy.

Overall, I'm super impressed with this game and can't wait to see what the upcoming final chapter has to offer!"
17876,"since it's early access, there's not much to do after you reach ""the end"" but it's a chill game to play with friends or solo. i personally like to play with my friends so i can abandon them on an island by accident though. i wish there were more furniture pieces or more decor options but so far, it's great and worth the money.

also, i hate the goddamn shark. everything else is chill."
17877,good!
17878,Fun
17879,Awesome game to play with friends!

17884,"Raft Character Selection =  A male dude. Or another male dude. 

Raft gameplay = The water is lava. 

EA Update Schedule = Non-existant

No thanks.

How to fix? 

Give us a female character model. Two of them. 

If you kill the shark, the shark stays dead. 

Update your game."
17885,"so i did finish the game and i find some of the core mechanics interesting enough. but after awhile every challenge either becomes meaningless or it remains annoying. 
the shark at the beginning of the game that eats your raft, meaningless after you armor your raft, and once you have a bow you can shoot it before it attacks you and it circles around for another go.
the more important tools break after a couple uses. i was able to build a large raft with 15 tree pots, i cant cut all of them down twice before the metal hatchet breaks. this is annoying. cant use the shears more than a couple times before they break. tools break way to quickly.
the recycler is annoying because it can take dozens of the simpler smaller items to fill it up and you have to put them in one by one. this takes forever. after awhile you will be replacing nearly every machine you have and just throw them overboard because you cant recycle them. 
depending upon what you put it in you will have to replace/recharge batteries very often running back and forth between the chargers and the machines. depending on how you build your boat this can be very annoying. there is a system for water to be provided to sprinklers automatically why cant we build wires between machines to keep everything charged. have enough copper laying around for it. 
if you are trying to build a large ship you will run out of wood very often. again annoying. i have chests of plastic that has little or no use outside of recycling. would be nice to be able to use it to build some walls floor or whatever.
the number 1 thing thats annoying is this game was designed for multiplayer first. i dont play with people so am stuck with losing my entire inventory when i die. why it doesnt just drop on the ground i dont know, guess it made too much sense."

17933,"It really just shines as being an adventure and there's just a little bit of magic in figuring out what you're doing and figuring out how to progress and making breakthroughs in technology and even though the early game can be frustrating, it is supremely satisfying to make it to the end game when you truly started from nothing and probable had to restart and rebuild multiple times."
17934,i like eating shark
17935,"The Fire Spirit card is unlocked from the P.E.K.K.A.'s Playhouse (Arena 4). It spawns a very fast, area damage, short-ranged Fire Spirit with low hitpoints and moderate damage. It resembles a small chunk of flaming coal. Fire Spirit launches itself at its target when attacking, destroying itself on impact. It is the same as those spawned by the Furnace. A Fire Spirit card costs 1 Elixir to deploy.

Strategy
The Fire Spirit's area damage is very useful against swarms of weak, small troops like Goblins, Spear Goblins or Minions. However, due to its relatively low health, placing it next to these units will result in it dying before it can attack. Placing the Fire Spirit at a distance allows it to safely deploy.
Against the Mother Witch, you want to place it close to her instead, so that it is killed as part of its attack instead of being killed by the Mother Witch, otherwise she will spawn a Cursed Hog from it.
If timed correctly, a Fire Spirit can damage all the Lava Pups just as they explode from the Lava Hound, defeating them.
Due to this splash, an effective strategy is to pair it with troops that deal high single hit damage but are easily stopped by the small troops mentioned, such as the Mini P.E.K.K.A. and Prince.
The Fire Spirit will connect to a Princess Tower provided it is equivalently leveled. Although it can easily be stopped, its cheap cost often lures out cheap spells and can cause opponents to over-commit Elixir-wise with their defenders. If used at the start of a match, it can also act as a way to tell what deck your opponent is using based on the card that they use to stop the Fire Spirit.
Fire Spirit can compliment pushes effectively due to its good cost-to-damage ratio and fast movement speed. For example, if the player is pushing with a P.E.K.K.A. and Fire Spirit behind and the opponent drops Minions to counter for example, the Fire Spirit drops the health of said units to be finished off by a Zap or cheap ranged units to protect the P.E.K.K.A, letting her continue towards the tower without taking extra damage.
It is most effective with fast moving troops like the Hog Rider, as they will not collide with each other as much during an attack.
A Hog Rider and Fire Spirit combo can make short work of Cannons.
The player can use units to soak it up. For example, the Skeletons or another spirit result in a neutral Elixir trade.
For more Fire Spirit value, a Furnace costs 4 Elixir and can spawn up to 7 Fire Spirits, giving the player almost twice as many Fire Spirits for their Elixir. It can allow for more consistent chip damage to Crown Towers and can bait spells due to its cost. However, the Fire Spirits do not spawn all at once, and its upfront cost is higher, so in a situation where the player needs quick area damage, the Furnace is much less versatile.
Occasionally, it is a good idea to combine the Fire Spirit with spells to defeat certain troops for a low Elixir cost. With a Zap, it can defeat anything up to Wall Breakers, with Arrows, it can defeat anything up to Skeleton Dragons, with Fireball, it can defeat anything up to a Night Witch, and with Lightning, it can defeat anything up to an Inferno Dragon. Use these combinations when you are lacking better counters for these troops or to get a good Elixir trade that would be granted compared to using two Spells.
Pairing the Fire Spirit with Electro Spirit is very effective, as they both cost 1 Elixir, which will only use a total of 2 Elixir. This combination can take out units such as Princess, Minions, Archers, Bomber, Firecracker and can even completely stop a Goblin Barrel with the help of the Princess Tower. This combo can help a lot of decks which try to bait The Log or Arrows, since the combo is very effective against swarms. It is also good on the offensive side, having more damage potential than The Log and can hit air. The player should make sure to deploy the Spirits a short distance from their targets to ensure they can finish deploying and attack successfully.
Although the Fire Spirit’s area damage radius is not enough to completely stop a tower-centered Goblin Barrel, there is still a way to counter the Goblin Barrel with Fire Spirit, although 2 of the Goblins will still get one hit on the tower (240 total damage at tournament standard). Place the Fire Spirit on the tile directly behind the tower, and if timed correctly, the Fire Spirit will push one of the goblins toward the tower, and it will one-shot all 3 goblins. This trick is very precise but can be pulled off consistently with practice. A tip for timing: Place the Fire Spirit at the exact moment when the Goblin Barrel is one tile above the river."
17936,Raft is a fun survival game where you go from a tiny raft to a cruise ship. I love advancing and making new discoveries. It is so satisfying to put a resource into the research table and have a million things pop up. It is overall a five-star game.

17965," I absolutely love this game.  It's a pretty easy to play game and the concept that you are living on a raft and you can't switch out is just cute.  This game reminds me of one of my favorite colony survival games called Flatsom, except of course this being a survival game, you build your own homes.  Definitely would recommend playing this game."
17966,one of best game
17967,Super enjoyable game.
17968,"Why do I keep going back to Raft? It's a very fun multiplayer experience. It's got a story that I can't stop digging into. The crafting system allows for interesting raft designs. The game has an atmospheric feel to it like not many other games. Most of all, I can binge it have a ton of fun, and come back to it later for more fun."
17969,"goed spel voor het bedrag het blijft steeds met nieuwe updates komen
"
17970,"I got a lot of bugs and when i played with friends I had even more bugs, couldn't play the game too much because of it

stuff like not being able to plant my beets and potatoes or even cook the fish I caught to get around it, had to restart a few times and i unlocked half the recipes, a good game concept but the gameplay lacks in content and the game isn't playable half the time.

would recommend but I would like to see fixes and updates in the future so for now I can't"

There IS planting involved but you mostly pick up trash to build your RAFT, which is quite funny. Still, i really enjoyed playing this with my partner and the background music is really calming. Definitely a must-buy if you wanna play relaxing games that involves building with your partner! ^^"

18069,"Eu sou um pai de 45 anos, provavelmente uma das pessoas mais velhas a jogar este jogo. Sou pai solteiro criando meu filho, que agora tem 14 anos. Meu filho ganhou este jogo no Natal de 2020 de seu tio, então o instalamos em seu computador e ele começou a jogar. Até o final da semana ele tinha 24 horas neste jogo. Isso foi horrível para mim, pois já era difícil encontrar maneiras de passar o tempo com meu filho, pois ele está sempre com os amigos ou apenas assistindo ao YouTube. Então eu decidi fazer uma conta no Steam e pegar esse jogo para ver se eu poderia jogar ao lado dele. Eu comprei o jogo, escolhi minha skin e mundo e comecei a jogar, mas eu estava preso no que você deveria fazer. Pedi ajuda ao meu filho e ele organizou um jogo para eu participar. Adorei, pois foi o melhor momento que passei com meu filho desde que minha esposa morreu. Desde então, esse jogo aproximou eu e meu filho novamente e agora passamos um tempo juntos fora de casa também. Este jogo me lembrou que há diversão em tudo, e trouxe muitas lembranças felizes para mim e meu filho."

18107,"Do not buy this game. The entire game can be laid out as follows: you reel in items from the sea. You then build upgrades to food, water, and resources. this takes about 2 ish hours if you're new. From that point on you sail to island completing various trivial tasks that do not accomplish anything other than coordinates that point you to another island so you can do it again. There is nothing interesting on these islands. The game is a scavenger hunt, and once you get the engines, you've essentially completed the game.(about 3hrs of content)

TL;DR :
This game has almost no content and is just a scavenger hunt where you get to wait 15 mins in between searching."

While I played with an without the shark tormenting me, I found the game to be a relaxing challenge that made me want to explore more and more with each new island. It's definitely got the ""Oooh piece of candy"" vibe to it which can easily get you lost. There is plenty to do and it will keep you occupied."

If you are into the whole buildy/harvesty/boaty game genre, this is one of the best.  Mechanics AND story are both very well done.  At any point you can just go off and do your own thing, sandbox style, then go back to the story at your own pace.  Like all survival games, once you figure out the mechanics it gets pretty easy, but never too easy.  If you aren't paying attention it can still bite you on the ass.  Absolutely worth a buy."

18139,"its a good survival game, and its fun to play it friends."
18140,if you get the right things this game is nonstop fun
18141,"bussy radius is 14
"
18142,I have enjoyed this game so much I can’t wait for more chapters to be added!
18143,"Great game! cheesy simple actions, deep game play for a basic game.
- BUT, The amount power usage is CRAZY!
- No off line mode... 
- 3rd person view does not work with most tools in the game so be prepared to switch back and forth a lot if you use it...
- creators got VERY  LAZY in all the last content > Massive empty islands with nothing to do or gather..."
18144,At first I thought it was a very small game with poor content but it appears to be a good game with great content. Almost perfect for playing with my girlfriend
18145,"I don't know how this has 93% overall positive, literally a game for kids, story sucks and isn't even difficult."
18146,New patch comming. Me happy.
18147,لعبه جميله الصراحه

18149,its fun
18150,"Love love love this game, and if you like survival games I would definitely recommend this one! A lot more fun if you play with a friend.. Just don't wear yourself out because there is not too much released yet. I played about 14 hours with a new player and we've pretty much completed both released chapters over the course of a week and now it is a waiting game until chapter 3 is out, which I'm sure we'll speed through. Super excited for more..!"
18151,nice game to play with friends

18155,"10/10 game! I don't think I've ever spent so much time on a game. I love that there is always something to do as long as you're dedicated to it, from building and making your raft better to discovering new islands and new equipment."

18163,i like this game
18164,good game. i love the full graphics on night
18165,Amazing! Finished the story content to date and now started on hard. One hour in and now we are fending off 3 sharks from our small 4x4 raft as we struggle to gain the supplies to survive. It is a blast!
18166,Bonding experience with my girlfriend. We love this game a lot.

18168,Bruce no one likes you anymore
18169,why can't the shark just be your friend?? what did you ever do to him?
18170,"Really fun game. There is so much to do, and even when you finish the main game, you can expand your raft and try building something amazing. It's a really open sandbox-style game."
18171,hog ridar
18172,A very fun and pretty game that you can easily express your imagination with a very interesting story to go along with it. Can't wait for Chapter 3

18178,good game
18179,it very fun
18180,give us chapter 3
18181,its fun  wish it had more choices of food  like other things u can get out of the sea like crabs lobsters octopus squid sea urchins shrimp and so on and it would be cool if we could set traps for food and get companions   and different drinks like tea from the flowers or whatever  and breeding animals would be cool  and bigger bag space but other than that its awesome and very addicting game
18182,fun
18183,"It's a really fun and calming game, defo a vibe. 100/10 :)"
18184,It's good. nothing more to say. 9/10

18202,This game is really fun Its kinda expinsive but it is worth the money because u can play with friends and its just fun
18203,fish
18204,Best Open-World survival game I`ve ever played so far. Suprisingly it`s even more fun if u play it alone. Some of the functions are then not available such as reviving but honestly even if u die a few time its just more motivation of searching for materials and crafting tools and stuff. 10/10 the music is fucking dope
18205,"i just like building my silly little raft in creative and then go into panic mode while playing co-op with my friend. i truly play survival games only to build, unless i'm playing in a group"
18206,raft deeznuts
18207,"would recommend  to play with a friend, and if you don't have friends then the shark is pretty friendly... sometimes"
18208,GJGJG
18209,good game i swear
18210,Beat the game maybe 16 hours in and hasn't been a chapter since 2020 the devs are more worried about skins then content what there was to play was fun for me its what there isn't to play. Don't waste your money until like 2030 maybe there will be a chapter update in the months to follow new years 2030.
18211,Good game :)
18212,"Raft is absolutely legendary at the time I am reviewing it. So I don't think I'll be adding anything to new to what's already out there. However I'll toss in my two cents why not. If you like games with resource gathering, food management, and crafting than this is the game for you! Set in an unending sea of garbage your goal is to collect as much resources and survive long enough to unravel the mysteries of the world. Build you raft however you see fit, mine is a multi-level condominium. My friend made a giant ship. The world is your oyster in how you decide to build your raft! The combat can be slightly difficult at times. Some mobs are pretty strong, but with the right strategies it's not frustratingly hard. Enjoy following the lore and exploring this addictive and compelling game!"
18213,Fun game to play with friends. It gets super easy as you go along as long as you build right. Will definitely come back for the updates.
18214,it is rediculously hard and the only problem is that the hook breaks
18215,"I can't get enough of this. I love the art, the story and even how you play the game. The music seems to match so well to the vibe of the game. I watched Markiplier play and I knew straight away that I would love this game."
18216,Started a playthrough by myself and lost two hours of progress because my raft clipped inside an island and never came out.

18223,good
18224,little grindy but if you get a good food source your set
18225,"Very good game, would recommend. 100%"
18226,"I built 2 massive rafts in survival and gathered more trash than the amount that exsists in the known universe,
i traveled through big islands with giant birds and bears,
i made 6 engines and plan on making more to reach light speed,
but like actually the lore in this game is epic and for being placed in flooded earth it has very nice enviroments 
including but not limited to, giant pine forest with bears, and an abandoned yacht, it has lore you can find through the notes found in the story islands and other things, within the ranger station on balboa you can find out people intended to eliminate africa, from what i can tell the ice caps have melted, i cant explain the strange birds but yeah, 10/10 you cant just live on an island"

18244,"Stupid game, I just arrived the big island with lots of bears, I can not take the blue berries that make the bears busy(it's bugged), I died by the bears three time lost everything of my items and materials, moreover I can not rejoin my world by the backup options because the save it overwrites above all backups. I DON'T KNOW WHAT IS THE BENEFIT OF BACKUP THEN!!!!!!

Now, every time I wanna play just get depressed when remember I don't have anything left and still did not discover the island"
18245,This game was really fun to play with friends. I could have played it non-stop if I didn't have to go to school and to sleep.
18246,"ver7 good

18250,"While i loved my time playing the game, i saw some really bad issues about it, the bad optimization leads to my computer catching fire every now and then, after 20-50 hours there is basically no replayability. the team needs to expand on the game and fix some bugs / optimize the game, otherwise great experience and if you liked the game, that's great! at least you had fun. i cherished the game while it lasted but i won't ever play it again except for multiplayer with friends maybe. 8/10 game 
5/10 size / replayability 6/10 too many bugs."
18251,"is kkr goeie je kan zieke speedboot maken maar die haai probeert steeds je kontje te bijten

18252,very fun to play once in a while
18253,i like this game due it noticing POLLUTION and also please stop polluting
18254,"very good but lost my game file, too easy to delete for stupid me"
18255,just wanna say that this is a great game and soooo easy to do
18256,"The beginning of this game can be a little punishing, especially if you are used to being hand held through games and tend to give up easily when facing resistance. If you like challenges and enjoy the satisfaction of overcoming harsh conditions, then you'll love this game.

It's not just the different levels of challenges that makes it interesting, there's also the exploration and the brilliant building mechanics mixed with immersion (despite the simplified graphics) that pulls you in and make you feel like a survivor in an apocalyptic setting.

The replayability is an important factor, especially for linear survival games. Starting the game on easy or normal and replay it alone on hard is probably the most common and rewarding way. The beginning of the game is less punishing since you have a better idea of what to do, but the rest of the game is still filled with enough risk that one wrong step will get you killed.

A nice part of this game, is that it's not finished yet. The game offers many hours of gaming in it's current state, but still has a lot coming in the future.
The story will get deeper and more complex"
18257,i built a 15 floor raft because i thought that the computer antenna had to be on higher ground
18258,yes

18260,COOL STORY
18261,You is to much of violent is this game but it ok I gess.
18262,Pretty cool survival game. There's a lot to do and is much better with multiplayer.
18263,"The number of positive reviews for this game is super suspicious. I've played a number of low effort, jank games and had fun with them... I've also played a number of boring games that aren't worth 5 minutes of your time, but at least have some polish.

This game is the worst of both. A jank, low effort slog with some of the worst gameplay I've ever experienced.

Do you want to hold your mouse button the throw a hook into the water... and then hold that same mouse button again the drag the hook back... with a wooden plank on it!!! Do you want to do this for hours on end??? Then this game is for you! Otherwise stay away.

The best part about my entire experience with this game was when valve refunded it anyway, even though I went over the 2 hour mark."
18264,my computer shidded
18265,Perfect game， just like me》
18266,"i can agree that this game gives me more thoughts of suicide, instead of happiness while playing the game."

18274,"this game so good
"
18275,"nice
"
18276,"Nice and relaxing game if you like base building / survival games with a good story, the couple annoying  things are the ladders can't place directly on the walls, the animals can partially penetrate the walls and the bio fuel refinery can't be connected via pipes to the bio fuel tank."
18277,"nice game
"
18278,a great survival/crafting game. i just wish the music played more
18279,I ONLY CLICKED YES TO TYPE THIS OUT. THE GAME IS AWFUL. THE 31 HOURS I PLAYED ARE JUST BECAUSE I WAS KIDNAPPED AND FORCED TO PLAY RAFT. WOULD NOT RECOMMEND.

18295,"I don't find this to be fun. Your character is too thirsty, and too hungry. The shark attacks far too often, the birds attack your crops too often, and even when you have a scarecrow. Basic equipment you need in order to keep things afloat like the spear are too expensive for how quickly they break. If you aren't collecting wood like a frothing fucking madman you'll run out and start loosing valuable pieces of your raft, which is going to cost more wood in the long run. I literally cant relax for one single moment in this game. It's a 100% uptime mad scramble juggling every single thing at once. no thx."

18300,"I hesitated to buy this game, but with so many recommendations, I had to give it a look. One thing that sold me on pushing the purchase button was the number of hours that gamers have spent on this game! Long term playability is key to deciding how much, if any, money should be spent. I am nearing 70 hours in on this game, and I haven't even scratched the surface of what this game has to offer. I could probably spend the next month playing non-stop, before I discovered all this game has to offer. Give it a look. You won't be disappointed!"

Looking forward to see what else they are going to add.  I would recommend if you like survival genre or  games like Ark, Conan, Valheim etc."
18314,it is a very fun game

18328,👍
18329,"spawn in a raft the end
"
18330,yes
18331,Insane game that  is worth the money.
18332,"For the most part Raft feels peaceful, relaxing and calm: you are adrift in a wide, almost endless ocean, collecting flotsam to expand your raft and build useful tools and machines. For the most part days are sunny and calm, with seaguls keeping you company, but occasionally the sea turns stormy and it feels like your raft might capsize at any moment.

You might find abandoned rafts floating alone in the ocean, with no hint about what might have happened to those who built them. Loot is good, though. There are islands as well: small ones provide valuable metals and food, bigger ones provide the same in larger quantities, and while there are animals for you to tame, there are also predators that you need to be wary of.

For the most part the game manages to keep the grind at minimum. You do need plenty of resources, but there are also plenty of resources to be had. This helps to keep the game experience relaxing and pleasant. The story is not overly complicated to follow, but there are some really frustrating points when you have to time your jumps exactly and if you miss, well, at best you have to retrace your steps and at worst you die - and when you die you lose everything you are carrying without possibility to retrieve any of it back. As I said, it can be frustrating at times, but even those moment have not spoiled the overall gaming experience for me as I find myself coming back to the game.

At the time of writing this the game is still in Early Access. I'd like to think that some of the elements that currently feel somewhat unbalanced will be fixed later.. My greatest annoyance is that It takes an unreasonable effort to kill various predators (and if you fail, you die and lose everything you carry). Having said that, I still recommend the game.

And Bruce? His a dick."
18333,enjoyable!

18341,"I love this game. Its awesome. but it has no sense of cardinal direction you will always sail slowly until you have engines. but tons of building options and no limits to how you build, except needing supports (duh)

18346,Pretty fun survival game with a interesting concept of antagonist. The building elements are really easy to work with and it's progression is good. The story is generally vauge but seems interesting and mysterious element to it. It's is pretty addictive when u have someone to play with everyday and it is a much more enriching experience.

18366,"I have played this game for awhile and I always love the challenge. Its great to play with your friends but you have to have basic pc game knowledge. Its a great concept. I wish that there were more characters you could play as and a way to either make more rafts or upgrade your ""raft"" to the point where it was a boat of some sort. Or make it so we can have a main raft and craft little kayaks and things. Also expand ocean exploration to different biomes similar to subnautica but more realistic."
18367,"got hit in the head with a rock overall good game

18371,"Even though this game isn't perfect, it's still a 10/10 experience for me. Yes it does need balancing and the story is not great but I just love this game so much and i can't stop playing even though I have every achievement and completed the game multiple times"
18372,Fun game...

18374,Good game
18375,"Thank you, Redbeet Interactive. Very cool!"
18376,very fun game
18377,"Easy way to escape, farm, build, and explore with self/friends."
18378,I really don't understand what people see in this game given its reviews. It's just so unfinished in every way. Not just in the early access way but in some way that everyone but me seems to appreciate? Unfinished like a box of broken crayons in only ugly colors maybe? That's not a good plaything to me though. If I want crayons I'd rather play Minecraft because it has rather nice crayons and a lot of other likeable traits too. If I want a survival game with a great story I'd rather play Green Hell or Subnautica (again).
18379,Wish there was a better save feature

18381,YES VERY GOOD

18392,Such an awesome game! Can't wait for the next chapter!
18393,"this game is really fun, especially with friends."
18394,"This is a really fun game is you want to build survival rafts and collect resources.  If you want a story driven game then this is probably not the game for you.  You can complete all of the story elements in under 2 hours and it's been a year and a half since the last story update. That being said it's a beautiful world and the initial exploration is genuinely fun and even a bit mysterious. Bugs I've encountered: Getting stuck several times, losing all my farm animals for no reason several times.  Had the animals when I saved and when I load the game again poof they are gone.  And it takes a fair bit of time to collect them. Also, my raft floods with every wave. Is it worth buying...I would say yes as long as you understand that you might never get a conclusion to the story and I have a hard time calling a game early access after 4 years."
18395,"great game for solo or multiplayer where you can feel the progress you made, and nice lore and story progress. but please fix the bug in tangaroa where you had to go online for using elevator or crane."
18396,THIS IS COOL GAME
18397,"If your gonna make a survival game at least think of some logic behind the range of the spear and hook, you literally have to be right next to an animal to hit it with a spear, and the bird that drops rocks on you needs to be 50% less accurate with the rocks and needs to fly 15% slower and also needs to pick up rocks near you so you have a chance to kill it{if you don't have a spear, or bow and arrow you cant kill it, boars needs to have a 15% slower attack rate with a slower charge recharge, and have you ever heard of crabs, i was generally surprised not to see them."
18398,"Perfect game if you like to get raped by a shark 24/7

8/10"
18399,if you have no friends to play with dont buy this.
18400,Boring
18401,it would be better for you to play with others so you don't lose much by taking turns being sacrificial pawns on the big islands and reefs but if your smart enough living solo isn't that hard just annoying but addicting
18402,fin gamo
18403,"This game taught me many things. Most importantly, ocean pollution is needed.

10/10"
18404,"Pros: 
The ocean effects are absolutely stunning, the most realistic wave effects I have ever seen.
Cons:
Literally everything else.
The game hasn't had a meaningful update in like 20 months at time of review (one tiny cosmetic update more than 6 months ago)
The game just drops you in the world with little to no guidance or explanation of mechanics.
The game is a buggy mess.

The mechanics weren't fun.  The bugs were game breaking.  I refunded after 41 minutes of play."

18420,so like there's the boat right and like what you like do is like build the boat and like try not to die right and then once you do that you beat the game and feel fulfilled and stuff and like chill
18421,"This is an excellent survival game that also has plenty of ways to use your creativity to build and decorate your raft. I recommend looking up gameplay videos and tips online when you first start, as there are not many instructions on how to get started and how to not die within the first twenty minutes of play. :D Once you have the hang of it, though, it is very fun!"
18422,"Yes, I love this game."

18456,good game it has shark i like shark
18457,"Early access for four years.  Company has been promising ""Chapter 3"" for close to two years and still hasn't delivered.  No dev updates for the last 5 months.  In the last update, they talked about all the things chapter 3 would bring, but STILL didn't give an ETA.  Feels like they are stringing existing and potential customers along to milk as much as they can out of ""early access"" without actually delivering a completed game.  If you're ok with a half baked game from what appears to be a half baked developer, then it's worth the price, I suppose.  Not recommended out of principle though."

18480,"This game has easily become my newest addiction. This survival game throws a huge twist, by being on water and land being so scarce. Mix that up with a variety of enemies, a vast amount of craftables, and some extra cute stuff added in?

18485,"This game is very fun and I highly recommend it. It is fun played with other people or alone. (It can be more fun with other people though) This game has a lot of parts to it, you can explore, build your raft, decorate, read the story, etc. I would recommend having a decent pc (you don't need a super good one though) for this game because otherwise it can be fairly laggy (I played on an old laptop and it was hard to play, keep in mind it was an old laptop though). There are huge islands that you can explore and get resources to go to more islands and improve your raft. This game has a ton customization options and you can make your raft as simple or as extravagant as you want. I got this game for free from a friend but I would be very willing to pay $20 to buy this game if I had to, I think it is a very fair price for such a big and amazing game. I am SUPER excited for future updates that will add so much more fun to the already great game. This game is an amazing game and it is one of my favorites. I hope my review helped you determine whether you want to buy it or not! It's an amazing game and I highly recommend it. Have a great day! :)"
18486,Amazing
18487,nice
18488,it's a fun survival game set in the ocean
18489,"In my opinion the game is very good at least in my 100 hours of experience, the story is short but it will be bigger around the next update at least what they said. The game is based on the boat where a shark is heading and from time to time destroying your boat, you have to survive and when you have a decent boat you will find several rare islands, cities and cute animals but that's not it you  can increase your boat as much as you want and the imagination is endless. There are several things to discover that will be difficult but people who like it games hard you can put difficult mode , which is rare to be able to finish the story. The community is great always helping others if they have discord of course. This game can be played online if you have steam friends who also have the game but it's rare for them to have it because the game costs money. the game is very cool and  never got tired of this game I highly recommend it but you may not like it because the game is more around the sea."

Novel concept and challenging to learn at times, even though once you understand the way things work in the game it is quite easy to figure out new stuff. 
The story is cool and the puzzles are done quite nicely, even though sometimes it can get quite difficult to navigate to the different points of the story.
Overall I am quite happy with the value vs. the money spent on buying this game.
I am hoping for an update with the next part of the story soon.

I see some people, even in story mode, build the most awesome designs of rafts. 
Can get very expensive in terms of resources, but there seems to be an endless stream of them :-)"

By yourself or with friends, your mission is to survive an epic oceanic adventure across a perilous sea! Gather debris to survive, expand your raft and be wary of the dangers of the ocean!

✔️ Atmosphere
✔️ Build system, rhythm, discovery and mysteries
✔️ Fun to play with friends
❌ Maybe the ""too big"" world but over time you start to realize that the islands are practically the same and start decorating where the loots are.

18540,"I don't usually enjoy resource-management games, but Raft has an ambiance that's serene and calming.  Especially considering the many dangers and tribulations the game throws at you, the game is relatively simple, easy to understand, and fun to play (both solo and multiplayer)."
18541,love it
18542,"As much as I like this game I have one HUGE gripe: there should be a way to change difficulty mid game. It's incredibly harsh in single player to have NO ability to get your inventory back after you die on normal even though with normal multiplayer you can. 
I had completely forgotten that was a thing until hours into the game. Lost so much stuff and also lost my desire to keep playing it now. 

In multiplayer it's not a big deal, buddy can come bring you back. In solo it should drop your gear where you die and you have to go back to get it, if you die a second time then it's gone gone. Something that makes it even SOMEWHAT even with how mutiplayer works in that regard. OR just let people change the difficulty from easy to normal or vise versa...

Apart from that, this game is a lot of fun and it's very satisfying to build up your raft and get awesome upgrades (until you lose them when you get killed by some stupid bird dropping rocks). 
I love the decorating update they added a while ago, that's one of the most fun parts of the game to me."

18547,"As the ACTUAL #1 RAFT player, this game is great and I highly recommend it."
18548,Its ok
18549,"Awesome game. Been on my wishlist for some time. I know there's some more story to come but other than that it plays like a complete game. Really feel Bruce is just understood. Playing solo and highly recommended. Would definitely be a blast with friends also, hopefully comes to XBOX when finished."
18550,its a fun game
18551,"if your afraid of the ocean, just no... but otherwise, veri epic. yes yes."
18552,yes fun
18553,Good porn
18554,"pros: It can be a great game to play with friends
         It has good mechanics
         It can be a fun game to play alone
         It has pretty good graphics
         It has good story
         It is a game I would come back to (And I usually don't come back to games)
         I think it has a good game concept

Cons: I can be buggy 
          It can be a bit annoying at times

Here's my rating of the game.... 
I think that this game is a very well made game, I think though, it could use a bit of fixing, because it can be a bit buggy. But other than that I think that the dev's are doing a wonderful job. So I think that the game could use a bit of bug fixes. Thank you, whoever is reading this, for taking your time to read my review."

18557,hi

18585,"A good sandbox with a surprisingly emotional storyline. Unfortunately it's unfinished currently but it should provide plenty of hours even in its current state, whether you only do the story, forsake it for the creative endeavours, or do a bit of both.

Looking forward to seeing if any of these characters are mentioned again Redbeet Interactive. The little astronaut will be waiting to be reunited with their creator."
18586,"ok folks.. 
honest review about Raft.
such a fun game if you like the idea of gathering stuff and craft something then build your raft into something cool (i just got managed getting a smelter and a paint mill so my raft is still meh). 
Def can be frustrating but the gameplay is much easier to play with a friend on normal mode especially. We just managed to get some stuff done and still more to go. There was a bug that all of sudden threw me out of my raft in the middle of the sea and lost the raft :/ .. Fortunately, I just started the game so not a big loss that I deleted the world cause I couldnt find where my raft was. lmao"
18587,i love killing my friends
18588,Good
18589,"I bought this game with some friends and it was alot of fun but after 10 hours we finnish the game. There hassent been a update since 24 july 2021 its nearly a year 

I would not recomendt because its 20€ and the gameplay its not long"
18590,"A great cooperative game. I like the soundtrack of the game, which can make people relax. gg"

18596,love everything
18597,"good
"
18598,"As far as dropping you into a new world with nothing but your wits and your curiosity, this game hits the bullseye. A must play with friends for the full co-op adventure experience."
18599,"i might've played this for about 9 hours straight in a single day, it was very worth it. i was just a little raft bitch against the world, it was swag. only downside was that after those 9 hours, i may have gotten seasick and it was unfortunate"
18600,"This game is a peaceful basebuilder with some great lore behind the surface. I honestly wasn't expecting this game to be this good, i just started because i saw lots of Youtubers playing it. Some controls are a bit funky, but that can be easily overlooked a little while into playing this game. Highly reccomend, i got sucked in and played for hours at a time."

18615,karen is racist
18616,Its super fun if you like adventure survival  games! Also if you like lore then you will definitely enjoy the different places which I will not say but its super fun and the raft is super customize-able with color and such. do recommend!

18620,"Pretty bare bones. A very short and mildly interesting story. Great concept though. Took me 3 hours to visit every island type and realize they're just copy and pasted, which is odd because the islands are so poorly designed that at first you'd think it was randomly generated. All the enemies can all be dominated simply by slowly manipulating W, A, S, D and then poking your foe with a spear. Easy difficulty is far too easy, but then normal is a great deal harder and involves a much higher level of tedium as you spend 30% of your in-game time managing your ever-deteriorating hunger and thirst. Updates are very few and far between and provide a dismal amount of content. Took me 5 hours to completely research all the non-story items in the tech tree. Took me 11 hours to complete the story and realize that there are other things that demand my attention and that I am falling behind my peers as I continue to waste valuable time on video games that I do not even enjoy."

18636,"I am playing single player, and what a great game.  The difficulty settings allow you to play a very casual crafting, survival exploration game.  The pace is a little slow, but I think it is meant to be that way.

It definitely is promoted as a multiplayer game, but playing single player is really fun as well, it all comes down to your preference.

"
18637,"SO MUCH FUN. I would recommend playing with a friend though, it's not that fun alone"
18638,most fun i've had in a while
18639,gargle

18660,raft
18661,its good
18662,"Very fun game to play with friends. The story I find pretty good as it kept me very interested in seeing the new locations every time, and piecing it all together. The game isn't too grindy or too hard so your main focus after a while is to just build up your raft and decorate which is good since the game has a lot of decorative options. Only issue I could say is that once you get your raft built up a lot, collecting enough wood to keep it going becomes very hard.

8/10"
18663,it's fun

This game is very fun, you can put your creativity to use, fishing, exploring islands, expanding your raft, it's all fun."

This game not only has a full story, but you can survive AND install mods! The game play's amazing, the story has greatly improved in the last update, the mods.... may have broken in the last update. But hey, the mods are being fixed pronto anyhow. I recommend this game with a strong 9.5/10! (With my opinion at least)"
18738,very nice multiplayer game! recommend  it especially for friends or couples.
18739,chapter 3 is amazing
18740,"This is a lonely game for single players, but if you have a couple of friends with you, you will have a great experience!"

18774,needs an update for more content rn. very good game
18775,"Whilst this is a nice game, it's relaxing, easy to play. It lacks objectives. 
It's nice that you can sail from island to island, stop and explore them and loot anything there. Sadly there are only a few different variants of islands, so if you go sailing for an hour and stop at each island, it feels like you are going around in circles as the islands are the same.
The hawks on the big islands are just annoying, even if you are running and they drop a rock on you from really high up, it still hits you perfectly as if it's a guided missile. 
The shark that is forever your friend glitches through the sea floor on the islands, so whilst you are grabbing loot off the floor the shark can just pop up from the ground and injure you. 
The game is nice and fun, but once you have built the base layer and armoured it, there is no challenge. Can build the boat up and up but what else do you do? I've build a huge boat, but didn't know what to do after that.
The objectives/story line are few in number, so once you have done them, built your boat up a bit, what is there to do? Nothing really.
It's a nice game, but it get's old fast sadly."
18776,It fun
18777,p good
18778,I love this game so much !!! So much fun. Developers are very friendly.
18779,"A survival craft game that has a very chill vibe to it that's perfect for just jumping into after a stressful day to unwind.  You can progress at your own pace, other than Bruce the shark following you, if you decide to go slow.  If you want to just island hop and gather supplies, that's OK.  If you want to spend some time fishing to stock up on food, that's OK.  Just kick your feet up and enjoy building your raft the way you want."
18780,love the peacefulness of this game
18781,"Very relaxing survival craft.  Shark is annoying.  There could be a better variety of threats on the open ocean to mix things up.  Overall, great game!"

18826,"Very fun survival game. Love it and very fun to mod in quality of life things to make the experience a bit more laid back as far as if you think you get hungry or thirsty too fast or if you think tools break too fast etc. You're able to tailor the survival experience for yourself through a very easy modding experience imo. It really isn't complicated.

The game play loop  and the ability to create a custom raft keeps me coming back for more. Definitely worth the buy."
18827,"love it 
"
18828,i very much like the open world gameplay but i dont like the bugs like there is this one bug that makes your character keep walking the way the front of your character is facing.

18830,"SOLO PLAYER REVIEW

Great game! Starts rather quickly as it just drops you in with little explanation. If you are used to survival games you can catch on pretty quick and understand the basics of what’s needed to keep all your statuses (food, water, ETC...) in check.

I have never had a chance to play Multiplayer mode as I don’t have gaming friends to play with. But with all the YouTube videos I have watched the balance of Multiplayer versus Solo is done quite well.

This is a great game for those preferring Solo gaming. The balance of difficulty between modes is not that harsh. My recommendation is that unless you are skilled at survival or this game in general solo players should stick to EASY mode as Normal does cause you to lose ALL your inventory if you die. You won’t have to restart at your last save but losing valuable items that DO NOT respawn or the game in some instances does not replace, I.E., that is no box left where you died, can be pretty disheartening to a solo player. (You must work pretty significantly to get some items back)

Otherwise, the challenge is still very balanced the enemies seem the same the challenge of resource gathering and building all seem generally equal. Only difference is you don’t have to worry so much about dying in Easy mode as you keep everything on you.

Overall, unlike other games such as “The Forest” or “Don’t Starve Together” you can definitely play this game as a Solo gamer and not have to sacrifice a lot of the actual game experience in order to enjoy it. No Handicaps Required!!

Gameplay = 10/10 Can’t wait for next update.

18831,It's a very chill game.

18844,"What a great start to a great game... 2 years ago! Like many of these Alpha games, progress seems to have stalled and the updates are but a trickle of what they once were. Promises on top of promises yet this is still a great game. I just cannot recommend it because I hate to support these endless alpha games that are never finished years after they have started. I would wait for this one to see if they ever finish it before supporting a game that is NEAR abandoned."
18845,this game is amzing i have only had it for week and played for 55 hours  i would recommend this to all my friends
18846,Shark Go Brrrrrrr

18878,"Great game with friends and alone. The developers care about the game and make sure every update is as good as it can be. Good story line and fun survival. The achievements system makes getting achievements really fun and you will NEVER be bored in this game because there is always something to do. If you have the money, GET IT!"
18879,great
18880,"it's a fun and addicting game, easy to burn lots of time on it"
18881,"You: ""Should I buy this ga-"" | Me: ""YES""
I have far too many words to express just how awesome this game is. Whatever flaws the game possesses or any in my ability to play the game, all of it simply pales in comparison to just how much fun you can get swept up in by the waves of it's virtual waters. You'll try the game out for a bit- THEN FOUR HOURS HAVE SUDDENLY SKIPPED BY. Even if the single player isn't for everyone, the shenanigans you can get into with friends, alone, is enough to warrant it's 20$ price tag. Food you can eat, animals you tame and kill, ruined locations to visit, or even sending the yes amount of sharks to hell.

Please get Raft. It's so much fun.
Excited for Chapter 3 too! <3"
18882,game was so much to get off to. Really enjoyed the amount of boob detail there was.
18883,W A T E R
18884,"Most relaxing life-or-death situation I've ever played. The soundtrack is great, the atmosphere is deceivingly soothing, and the gameplay is very addictive. I've built my home from trash and I'm now floating my way across the world, danger under every wave, loving every minute of it. If you enjoy survival sims, like Valheim or Space Engineers, I highly recommend Raft."

18895,Good game
18896,"This survival craft game provides hours of highly addictive entertainment, solo and when played with friends! Also shark (aka Bruce) is not your friend, defiantly food!"

18903,good
18904,"I am a 45 yo father, probably one of the oldest people playing this game. I am a single farther to my Son, who is 14 now. My son got this game for Christmas in 2021 from his uncle, so we installed it on his computer and he started playing. By the end of the week he had 24 hours on this game. This was horrible for me, as it was already hard for me to find ways to spend time with my son, as he is always out with his friends or just watching YouTube. So I decided to make a Steam account and get this game to see if I could maybe play alongside him. I loaded into the game, picked my character and world and started playing but I was stuck on what you where supposed to do. I asked my Son for help and he hosted a game for me to join. I loved it as it was the best time I had spent with my Son since my wife had died. This game has ever since brought me and my son closer again and now we actually spend time together outside the house together as well. This game reminded me that there's fun to be had in everything, and it has brought both me and my Son many happy memories."
18905,"yes
"
18906,shark
18907,"Great game for the cost! but there hasnt been a story or major update since what October 2020?
I recommend this game but its very incomplete. Something to play while you wait for other games to come out."
18908,when i was once a boy i once was a boy who dreamed me (as a boy) i was swimming iun the pool (like a boy) and is was basically on raft floating boy like and it was basically raft so i would so to be boy like of me i think this is a good game
18909,Yes
18910,I just wish I had a better computer so I could play with higher resolution.
18911,"Great game, It is extremely fun with friends, but slightly challenging at times, but good game overall."
18912,"Really fun to play with friends, very chill game. The story chapters provide an extra challenge to the game with the bigger islands you encounter along the way. Half the time me and my friends end up floating about listening to sea shanties whilst building our ever expanding raft! I look forward to future updates. Keep up the good work guys!"
18913,big boy bruce will gobble u up if ur not careful
18914,atheaix
18915,"Short game overall but I guess it's still in beta? Other than that I thought it was great open game. I don't want to sound like a buzzkill but I might suggest maybe put MORE space between major story-line islands? Ya know, stretch it out a bit like a true 'water-world' experience? I'm sorry, it ended to soon for me since I actually really enjoyed it, lol."
18916,"A games so wonderful that even my GF wants to play it with me. 
Music is amazing! And gameplay really calms the mind."
18917,The shark bites too much I need a restraining order. making dry brick is too hard cant get enough sand and clay but anyway the game is very fun and enjoyable.
18918,i like the build and game mechanics
18919,"There is a lot of fun to be had. That being said, don't rush to try to do the story content, have fun designing and building your raft. Once you start into the story, you'll burn through it pretty fast. Hopefully this chapter three that is taking so much longer than the other chapters really gives us more."
18920,"Amazing game, so much to do and when you figure out how things the game just expands"

18932,"This is going to be short and simple but I think it was a good game. But I also got really bored really quickly. It's fun for a bit but then you just start dozing off as you play the game like, ""what am I doing with my life right now."" I'm a bit mixed on it so I won't say anything more so if you want the game, you can get it but I'm also not recommending it to anyone either. If you really wan't to see a real review, I suggest you watch one on Youtube."
18933,This is an amazing game with or without friends. I recommend playing this game.
18934,water
18935,story line is shorter than pp
18936,i love it
18937,I would say that this game is great and I have had a great time playing with my friends and going on wild adventures on our raft but when you are looking to buy this game get other people to play it with you because its just not the full experience playing single player.

18964,"So far I love it! The tree mechanics are poo poo is the one of my biggest complaints, the other is material farming for certain stuff, but I am excited to just start on the lore. I love the decorating and cooking! Hopefully it expands!"

18966,add steam workshop
18967,"good game 
"
18968,yes
18969,fun
18970,"This is an addictive and fun game. I was able to play it with my son, which is rare for many modern games. Most are not designed to be entertaining for all ages. I applaud that aspect. I also applaud that this game is not centered around violence and foul language. I know I sound old saying that, which might be true. Too many games now lack a good story and most rate you on how many people you kill. It's nice to see something different."
18971,"i cant stop playing. totally addictive if you like survival genre.

great survival game with so many things to do and craft. lovely visual design. background music could be improved because sometimes the game gets too quiet. i play it solo because i like discovering and doing every task myself, but i once played with friends for a couple of hours and it was fun, so if you like co-op survival game, this game is recommended. even in its early access stage, it offers so much content and fun things to do and discover. it's not easy nor hard to play (not as challenging as green hell for sure) but a bit harder than subnautica imo because you lose health rather fast here. so far i have none to complain, but if i have to pick one thing i dislike is when you drop items from inventory they become this ugly boxes until they disappear. other than that, it is a great game. looking forward to the full release."
18972,"THE best game you can build boats in
"
18973,Its frustrating and fun
18974,Nice survival and Chill game!~!
18975,this game hurts to play
18976,"Initially I thumbed this game down due to it's very slow development progress. Mere weeks later, the devs finally finished the game. Fantastic! Time to alter my review...

Sadly I still can't recommend Raft. I was hoping that the finished game would mean controller support. Unfortunately, I was wrong.

As somebody who has long term complications from a back injury, sitting at a desk, using key/mouse is not a comfortable experience. In fact it's agony after an hour or so. 
So if I want to play, I'm forced to precariously balance my keyboard and mouse pad, in a recliner chair if I want to play. Far from ideal, and also not comfortable.

I just don't see why a fairly simple game cannot have native controller support? Those of us with injuries, disabilities, special needs would certainly appreciate it."
18977,"I'm bad at games in general so I've been mostly playing on ""easy"" and ""peaceful"" mode, and it's still very fun!"
18978,thirst and hunger... thirst and hunger
18979,raft on water very few ilands
18980,"Certainly not the best Survival game on Steam, but one does not have to be the best to be a good time."

18987,very nice!
18988,great game if u like cozy survivle
18989,"Raft is a shitty game with shitty content, and even shittier mods on their discord channels.

This game takes way to long for an update, the updates are always broken.. You should be able to break the raft into separate rafts by now, but you can't because trash won't spawn.. Once these developers learn how to treat people properly on a public chat, they may finally be able to get more players in their game.

You don't even have to break a rule before they ban you for something they don't like..

Astropipe is the worst moderator in human history and I will never recommend this game as long as this child is a moderator with this game.

Game is not that good to begin with, then you start banning people for nothing in discord.. I am not going to stand for this blatant breaking of my fundamental rights on a public discord chat."
18990,great game
18991,"Relatively chill time, fun to craft. Once you set up a good raft things can start to really flow. The one issue is we're still waiting on the next chapter... That kinda sucks. But it is what it is."
18992,Its Like The BEST GAME EVER OMG!!!!!
18993,Worth every penny this game is very fun! Would recommend would recommend to buy with Friends to have a blast together this game is breathtaking !!
18994,Played with my friends and it's the most fun we had in a while but the game was relatively short and we are just waiting for the next major update wait for the update and then buy the game
18995,"fhggggk,ijl;/.knb"
18996,wen update
18997,nice game
18998,raft. fun game. make raft.
18999,"This game is ok needs some work in terms of game progression throughout the game along. Visually are great, weapon damage is probably not the best with a whole spear and 2 hits to kill a boar along with how to get clay and such considering you have to make shark bait. I played this game when it was on another site free to play and just starting out"
19000,"This is why I try not to buy early access games. All too often they get put out to pasture FAR before completion. This game has been out for sale for 4 years now. Its fun, but very shallow. There's very little content. The content that has been added is all cosmetic junk for basics.  I am one of those people who believes cosmetic stuff is stupid. 
How about adding some items that actually have a point? Some stuff with stats? Purposes? Maybe even some mcguffins? 
And on top of all that, add some more GAME to this game. like I said its fun, but you can hit the wall of stuff to do in less than half a day."
19001,This game is very good and you dont need good pc
19002,"Personally, I don't find the story all too interesting. You can guess most of it from looking around for 10 seconds when you load in. But the game is very fun, has a clear upscale and at the end of the game is mainly about how cool you can make your raft look."
19003,"This game is fire, need chapter 3 tho"
19004,Very fun survival game.  Very tough getting started but it gets easier.
19005,is nice...
19006,"good game to kill time and relax, worth a buy if you like relaxing survival games. don`t really know what els to say"
19007,verry laggy still fun tho it sucks that when you try to jump onto the raft u go deeper in the water and killed by the shark
19008,"I love this game, all the challenging aspects are well implemented and not impossible to overcome. This game is paced well and stays exciting until the end. Good luck rafting if you pick up this gem!"

19023,"had some fun with friends, but yea.. still waiting for the story progression since we don't really care about decorating my raft."

19032,fun
19033,good exploratory content drip fed across hours of almost nothing that builds up to a story climax that is disappointing
19034,"Sensacional, que jogo que foi bem pago! Vale a grana investida jogando sozinho, com a galera aí vira climax."
19035,Really good game
19036,cool
19037,"Much water, kill shark, get head!"
19038,Great to play with my kids.
19039,Keeps me engaged for a long time. Really fun to play with friends. I usually don't like games in water but I am enjoying this one quite a bit.
19040,good
19041,Great Game!
19042,very fun with my cat because i had to eat her since i was at sea for 10 years please i cant get rid of the guilt someone end my suffering

19048,POTATO yeS
19049,friendly shark
19050,Super hard when just starting but once you get a handle on the game its a breeze. 80/100
19051,This game is very fun until your character gets hungry/thirsty and decides to walk at the same pace as a man who just got a vasectomy. Also finish the godamn story already
19052,GOOD GAME
19053,cool survival game
19054,"absolutely love this game! played through in both co-op and single player
love playing both for the story and for the raft building 
cant wait for future updates!"
19055,"fire
"
19056,"raft is a game ahead of this generation and i cant see us catching up anytime soon.

its ahead as you spawn on a raft then expand the raft and explore the islands full of wacky wild life, its truly a master piece and forever will have a place in my dark, corrupted, sad heart. Its a game you can play when you feel sad it doesn't make you feel better but it also doesn't make you feel worse and that's okay.

thank you, raft for changing my life for the better. xx <3"
19057,game
19058,"Its pretty good, i just wish you could recover your items after death and gather underwater resources without the 1000 health shark coming after you."
19059,yes
19060,fun
19061,:)
19062,"I LOVE this game! There's so much to do and so much to explore! i would most definitely recommend the game ""Raft"" to everyone on steam."
19063,its kool
19064,"Probably one of my favorite survival craft games out there, super excited for the new chapter. The start is slow and can be kinda punishing your first time going through it, but its not impossible. The Shark (which is your main threat) feels to aggressive imo but its not impossible to deal with. Getting to the part where you can start discovering the main islands makes you feel so accomplished. It's so nice and satisfying watching your raft turn from a rinky dink little plank into a floating house with automated farm and fuel going on. Some of the tools i feel could use more durability and armor seems rather hard to obtain. But overall i love this game and highly recommend it. It's even better when you have a group of friends to get on and play with all the time."
19065,Such an amazing story and game
19066,"jemsie I have to
"
19067,good gaem nice strategy and fun to play with friends :>
19068,pain
19069,sharky killy
19070,very gud me liek dis
19071,I played the original before it got to steam and it was innately fun but for some reason i had to return it for it was buggy here and there but from what i could tell is when all the bugs are out then i'll re-buy it. don't like having games sit in my library just holding a space reminding me it could be better don't need the stress.
19072,"good
"
19073,"this game is an extremely well polished grindfest that might appeal to people who want a ""feeding a man with a tapeworm"" simulator. your food and water bar go down so fast that cooking food will likely involve starving nearly to death several times up until you can make the grill, wherein you will be upgraded to *almost* starving to death. water is slightly better because you can store a bit more, which is a saving grace (but only after you get the upgraded water source).  after making a sustainable farm you have two choices: either run back to your ship over and over while exploring the larger islands, or waste a bunch of storage space having enough food to explore without dying. 

fishing is also, similarly, tedious grindy and annoying. one fishing rod takes a ton of materials and doesn't even give you enough fish to be worth the effort in the slightest. 

the shark attacking the raft isn't much of a big deal after you get a decent sized boat, although gathering wood before you have a bunch of catching nets (which need wood) is a monumentally grindy and annoying task. hooking stuff coming in is maybe supposed to make gathering driftwood and leaves more interesting? but it fails at that miserably because it takes no real skill and is, once again, just tedious and annoying. 
they also give you just as many leaves as they do wood, which is stupid because you use wood for way, way, more and I'm currently sitting on hundreds of leaves that I have no use for. 

it would make a lot more sense for wood to come in more frequently since you actually need it way more but if the developers were capable of that kind of forethought I wouldn't be leaving this review in the first place. 

what it comes down to, ultimately, is that nothing is as fun as it should be to carry a game where you have to repeat these actions basically every five minutes at best and every 30 seconds at worst. I wish I could understand why this game is so popular and beloved, but I don't and I probably never will. I just don't see the fun in minecraft where the hunger bar is more likely to kill you than the final boss. 
"
19074,Multiplayer was fun.
19075,"One of the best survival game I have played and this game has a small team. This game is so good, better than minecraft. Compared to minecraft I cant get board theirs always something to do. Highly recommend 10/10"
19076,"Once you understand the basics and the balancing act it takes in order to survive, the game becomes enjoyable. It is very frustrating, however, that you have to go to outside sources in order to even figure out how to move, how to pick things up, how to do pretty much anything. There is no help there within the game itself. Basic instructions or a tutorial at the beginning would be very helpful."
19077,"great game
"
19078,"I really like this game because it isn't too easy, but it isn't hard either. I also like how there is a storyline to it too."
19079,This game is really fun to play with friends but the shark is honestly A PAIN.
19080,yes but would be epic with VR support
19081,"J'ai fini le jeu en 4 heures, bien mais pas terrible, 5/10, pas mal mais pas ouf"
19082,VERY FUN
19083,blub blub
19084,Really enjoyed playing this game with my daughter. The only negative feedback i cam say is that this game could be even better if it had controller support
19085,a really fun game to play especially with friends
19086,ha ha shark goes brrrrrrrrrr

19094,"Great idea for a game since it enables you to build a shelter, but also explore freely !"
19095,FUN but has a bit of a price of 19.99$
19096,good
19097,cool game
19098,sharc fune
19099,This game is really fun. i really like it. it has story and more is coming soon cuz we only have chapter 2 rn with the renovation update you can even go crazy and build massive rafts! or even other things that you want to.
19100,yes
19101,"I would recommend this game to Minecraft lovers. Its a builders game, very ope ended. A survival game, builder game and exploration game. While players can make the decision for what they eat and live in. But are still bound to enemies, weather, and basic survival needs. The game is open to customize controls and even settings that make seasickness go away. Making it accessible for people who get motion sick very easily. Graphics are adjustable and are decent quality. There are many different places, biomes, creatures, and issues to explore and expand upon. On top of it all, theres hard, medium, easy, peaceful and creative modes. This game is addictive and I love it."
19102,!!!i love crab game and RAFT!!!
19103,pijo
19104,the game is kind of slow at the start but gets fun
19105,Is the best you can play multiplayer But the thing that i dont like at this game is that if a frend create a map you can`t join on the map if the frend is not in the map so pls update and i love this game
19106,"One of the best survival games there is out there, love that you can customize everything!"
19107,"I'm immensely disappointed with this game. I've had an eye on it for so long but really wanted it for the co-op. 
I purchased the game to play with a friend but the multiplayer is so broken its impossible to play together. Connection so poor and laggy and trouble shooting suggests downloading third party VPN app is the only fix we could find. 
If multiplayer is so poorly implemented that some people cannot play together without having to perform arduous work around's it shouldn't be in the game. If Dev's fix the online multiplayer i would change this review in a heart beat because the core game seems great."
19108,good game
19109,sj
19110,r
19111,im a lil addicted its so fun and kind of relaxing
19112,"The game starts on a small raft you will expand little by little. Basic research is done on a table. More advanced items are added through the discovery of blueprints. Most of the game is spent gathering raw materials and growing food. The story really starts once the radio and the engine become available, and food and water are produced on board.
The shark can be quite annoying because kelp and metal ore are found underwater.
The raft is the centre of the game, not the player.
Looking forward to chapter three."

19175,"After joining 3 of my buddies on a 4x4 square and toying with the mechanics I was instantly drawn in. I remain impressed by how the devs built such a simple but unique gameplay experience. I appreciate the allowance for freedom of expression in raft creation. A raft could be pure efficiency or excessive in design. The introduction of new Islands to explore/story elements felt like a building crescendo that left me waiting for more content. Play solo or with friends.

19188,"This game is really fun. Though I haven't played with friends, it was still a blast to try and survive. Truly a fun game that is great for anyone who is okay with a shark."
19189,"I have not played a lot at the time being, but this game has been both the most relaxing and the most harrowing experience I have ever had. I have split my time so far into playing with another person on Hard, and playing with another on peaceful.

 I have been attacked by sharks, built a cool house, been flung off my raft into the sky at alarming speeds, stabbed a shark in the head with a spear, been rammed by boar and lost all my inventory, put up 5 ""live laugh love"" signs, and had my raft slowly drift away from an island i was exploring by the wind, leaving me stranded.  This rollercoaster of emotions was worth it with how much fun this game is with friends and how fun it is to hear 2 people scream ""SHAAAARK"" into your ears.

Graphics are great, it'll run on a potato, it has everything you want from an open world survival game. Like Sea of Thieves with base building and without the toxic PvP.

I'm not so much into all the adventure as they are, so I cook, fish and keep up the smeltery as they bring stuff onto the boat. :) Good game, and fun for an older person like myself, as long as that dang shark stays away from me and I don't fall in the water! :)"

19224,"Raft is a first person survival game which can be played singleplayer or coop with friends. You start adrift in the middle of dystopian flooded world, where rising waters have left nothing behind but endless oceans full of junk floating about, and a few isolated islands.

You're hungry and thirsty and will quickly die, so you have to fish junk out of the water like wood and plastic and start building tools like water purifiers, cooking fires, fishing rods, so that you can survive. Slowly but surely you expand your raft adding a research table to research new tools and building materials. The research table allows you to unlock sails to control your movement, fishing nets to automatically catch junk for you, and eventually a radio antenna so you can scan the world around you and find islands to visit. Islands bring with them many new materials, plants, animals These new materials and tools allow you to continue to expand your raft, which you can design however you like, you can add new floors, walls, gardens with grass and fences to keep animals with you.

Once you're self sufficient and can locate islands you begin to follow a story. New unique places open up for you to sail to and visit, such as oil rigs, island towns, etc. Each new area has a series of puzzles to solve, enemies to kill and plot which is told through notes, as well as new blueprints and materials.

The game has a very nice sense of progression, the graphics are cartoon like, but have a good aesthetic which looks nice and runs well. The soundtrack has been well made and suits the game. It's not out of early access yet, there's still more content to add but with a casual play through I found myself getting to the end of the current content taking about 28 hours. Well worth purchasing at the current price and looking forward to future updates."
19225,"amazing, more fun with your homosexual friend"
19226,"goood fuck the shark
i like collect plastic for sea"
19227,"It's a fun game but there are two major issues. One is that the formula for the game seems to completely change once you start the story content. And then two, the story content hasn't been updated in almost two years (Oct 2020). So when you buy the game you gotta assume you'll get a little bit of fun out of it but the developers aren't going to wrap this one up probably at all."
19228,"great game , waiting for updates are both exciting and frustrating, i want to play more but after finishing everything it gets boring and I start from beginning"
19229,"very good!

19239,"This game is so fun and their are endless possibilities of what you can do to your raft, exploring Island, abandoned Rafts you can do so much and you can give yourself challenges after you finish the game once you can do it on other difficulties and maybe after you can do it competitively and try get the speed run world record . So over all i love this game and recommend it to all."
19240,Been having a lot of fun with this survival game :)
19241,"This is an amazingly immersive game. Like a good book, I stayed up late for several nights exploring the world and burning through the content.  It is a lot like the movie Waterworld, crossed with Subnautica and Minecraft, without all the mining.  I cant wait for the next update!  If you like crafting and building and sailing a boat, this is the game for you."

19277,Game is poggers
19278,"Raft is a fun game to play, the gigantic birds dropping stone on you are pretty annoying and MAMA bear but other than that good game. 
My favourite part is to kill the shark."
19279,I made a circle. I am happy with my circle.
19280,Raft is a buggy mess and it gets boring after 30 minutes.
19281,"fun survival game would recomend
"
19282,shark very bad not a nice guy idk y bruce so angry
19283,"Survival game and management of resources and exploration on a raft, with a main history that we follow.
Some tutorial is missing to get started with the controls.
I really liked the beginning (Chap 1 and beginning chap2). Discovering different things to craft, islands with various biomes.
The end of chapter 2 is less pleasant because there is a repetitive side, finding the same resources in the same places successively, even if history islands are always great.
I sincerly hope in chapter 3 we will return to some more wild places :)"
19284,good
19285,"needs more work
kinda boring/slow gameplay
unpolished and in permanent early access
ok fun for the price and depending on how in-depth you want survivalcraft games to be
fun enough"
19286,"boring, grindy, low quality - don't get how this shit sells so much
this and planet crafter are the 2 most overrated games on steam, fight me"
19287,Good time killer. Easy to play with friends. Make massive builds for no reason. Constant grind for materials.
19288,IT GOOD
19289,"good game, would recommend playing it"

19304,Good survival game
19305,"Probably the most unique survival game I've played to date. The gameplay is phenomenal with very little to zero bugs, and interesting story that makes you eagerly wait for the next chapter and a beautiful art-style. Building a raft may be off-putting for creative builders but you will be overwhelmed by the suff you can do here. 

As a fan of the classic movie ""Water World"" this is a dream come true.

And also, excellent devs <3"

19325,yep
19326,"Its so fun once you get the hang of it, I love it!"
19327,"It's hard to believe that Raft is still only Early Access, but I finally got around to playing this and I absolutely LOVE it. Something so serene yet so somber about sailing about the ocean, constructing your raft, fending off the sharks and what other creatures may come your way all in a world so wide and open, yet so quiet and lonely. There's a wonderful diverse world out there with some great stories to tell, and it's only going to get bigger with Chapter Three releasing in the near future! This is definitely one of my favorite games out there, and recommend it to just about anyone. Five Stars to you Axolot and Redbeet Interactive, I can't wait to see what you guys come up with in the future! Sail on!"
19328,I love this game so so so much it is the best ever that is all
19329,"Fun with friends, I assume. I don't have any."

19333,"A survival game, built different. Normally you spawn on an island, in a village or in a city, but in this game that topic is totally irrelevant which is nice to experience. Amazing game!"
19334,its fun
19335,"super good, must download"
19336,this is a very fun survival game to play with friends. I am already addicted to this game and cannot stop playing. I recommend you buy it

19355,"Pros:
Easy learning curve
Intuitive building system
Weather system was nice


Con:
Busy body grinding is repetitive
Some needed supplies come in late late game
Weather system was lacking in audio

Fun game, I felt like I could of done more. Waiting on Chapter 3."
19356,Great. Still in early access though for whatever reason
19357,This game is really fun because you can play with friends .You could also survive on a raft and you could do anything you want plus this game is free to play which is appreciated because you can buy yourself the win.Overall good game keep up the good work
19358,G
19359,best played with a mate. 10/10 cant wait till the update this year
19360,A bit grindy
19361,you can have a second floor on your raft or five if that suits you :)
19362,"Raft is an expansive game, I love it and my friends are always suprised at what I can cook up building wise. I've spent way too much time on this game, but I'll continue to do so. 
When ever I get the opportunity to I ask my friends to join, and am always telling the ones who don't have it to get it, because the more the merrier!"
19363,"Casual survival game, that still can feel challenging when playing on a hard setting.
There is a basic story, but mostly it is about having fun with friends and designing a cool raft.

The idea is simple; you drift around on your raft and fight animals and harvest resources to improve your raft and fend off a shark that has a taste for human flesh... and likes to bite your raft to smithereens.

I wished there was more content to the game and that there where random encounters with other sea creatures that attacked the raft than just the shark."
19364,"Very fun to play either solo/multiplayer, very recommended if yoiu wanted to play with friends or family."
19365,Boat was small once.. Now boat big... Boat is island..
19366,Good Stuff. Make Spear then water and farm first lol

19397,Good
19398,Raft is a heartwarming and interactive tale about what Filipinos go through every day
19399,love this game. can get annoying at certain times but mainly very fun
19400,maybe we live the average day of a floridian in 2050 when their state submerges underwater due to climate change
19401,Gud.
19402,yes
19403,"I love this game! It has everything you want in a survival game but what stands out to me is that there is actually a story. Too many games within this genre lack this element and you quickly run out of things to do after you learn all the crafting recipes and build a base. With Raft, however, your effort feels more purposeful. The chapters add a bit of a challenge but are still easy enough for relaxing gameplay and you can easily put the story aside to pursue other objectives- whether it's bobbing around in the ocean and expanding your raft or exploring the depths. I had a lot of fun decorating my raft before completing chapter 2 and am looking forward to the following chapters. This game is also easy to pick back up if you leave it alone for a while, chances are that you'll keep coming back to this game and will gradually expand your floating abode over the course of months and years."
19404,nice game
19405,good game
19406,Good.. if You have friends
19407,fun wiv friends
19408,very god game

19411,"If you are looking for an adventurous single player or a friendly multiplayer game, this is it. Raft is a lot of fun, I have been playing it with a group of three and it is a lot of fun. There are a lot of creative aspects to the game which I personally enjoy such as base building and object coloring, but there is also combat, and a great story line. My only complaint is they are not updating fast enough, so if you are on multiplayer you plow through the story line very quickly (however its not complete).  I highly recommend this game to anyone looking for a casual play style, and an interesting game mechanic."
19412,this game is very nice to play with friend online.
19413,.
19414,Yes
19415,raft
19416,"Very grindy, but is amazing with friends. ive only played on easy so far, but i HIGHLY recommend this game"
19417,good.
19418,based not cringe shut up fokoe
19419,"A really cool open-world ocean based sailing game. I thinks it is worth playing but could use a lot of tweaking from the developers. Take for example If you're looking to build some elaborate ship like I did you might have to work around the ""snap"" construction as opposed to custom placement. It's only the minute things like that that may take away slightly from the player experience. Overall great concept and great game."
19420,"Good game, kill shark, win."
19421,"I drowned my little brother

Then I turned on my computer to play some raft."
19422,yes
19423,"I loved almost everything about this game, great to play with friends, a new adventure, and I love sandbox games. Only complaint is how quickly your hunger goes down and how cooked potatoes do basically nothing for it. Ever had a cooked potato? It's filling! So why do you get almost no hunger from it?"
19424,It's creative
19425,Fun
19426,"Raft is a great game with amazing story and poop lol hahas funny lol xd Poo LOL1!!   !

"
19436,I Like this but after the story finishes the game gets kinda boring alone.
19437,"Fun, yet challenging game that can easily be picked up and put down for quick play times.
Once you figure out how everything works, its still hard, but is becomes easier (until the shark eats your raft)."
19438,THE GAME IS VERY GOOD SOMETIMES YOU CAN LOSE TRACK I WOULD SAY BETTER THE MOST OPEN WORLD\ADVENTURE GAMES.
19439,"I absolutely love this game... but they need to add more updates. It has been stale or me for some time now because there is not nothing more to do with the story. Great game, fun with friends. Very good to look at. Just needs the updates."

19461,"Bought Raft three days ago and spend almost 1/3 of the past time in game. Absolutly worth it's price and especially if you're playing with friends, you won't be bored."
19462,This game is a fun raft experience with a storyline of... Carl-Bason (Just Kidding). Start off simple with a small raft to a giant pardice raft. At least check this game out on youtube and if you like it get it.
19463,"The game has been out for 4+ years and still has no controller support; devs ""want"" to add it, but have made zero effort to do so."

19471,"This game is utter butt cheeks. I should've expected much from a $20 game. This game is 4 years old with little to nothing to show for it. No content, very buggy, oh and NO tutorial! You literally have to navigate this game through trial and error or just looking up stuff online. The devs took their money and left this game in the toilet. Wouldn't recommend this game to anyone. Save your money guys."
19472,"Thought I was encountering a bug but turns out getting randomly teleported into the ocean is part of the game which is not explained at all, like everything else in this game. Could not even enjoy the game because I was too busy trying to understand how to get off my feet with no tutorial while constantly being harassed by sharks, food meter, and hunger meter."
19473,Balls
19474,"If u have no friends, u go insane"
19475,"it a really great game that is 3x as much fun when playing with a friend, the upgrades and islands and survial is great!"
19476,good fun brrrrrrrrrrrrrr
19477,I love how the game portrays space and where you need to put the antennas to get to the other islands. also i love how you are free to build whatever you want
19478,"first of all, the complete absence of sex scenes was appalling and along with the repetitive disappointing game-play, my impressions of raft where and still very repugnant."

Great game, good job!"
19498,This is a very neat game. It's Really Fun To Play In a Creative World Or Test Your Luck In a Survival World Or You Can Play With Your Friends Too! So I Would Reccomend It.
19499,This game is very self paced. If you want to take your time and explore you can or if you want to start finding the key islands you can. You can build your raft however you want with tons of customizing plans. Super fun and never ending.

19510,VERY GOOD GAME TO HURRY TO COCK
19511,"I have recently delved deep into the open world survival base building genre of games, and this one is the perfect addition. 
Simplistic in nature since it starts you off on a one wooden foundation and lets you explore whichever way you want. This feeling of freedom is quickly dispersed when you realise you're all alone (unless you're playing co-op) and theres a nasty predator trying to get to you through your raft. The way this game made it possible to advance while still being stuck onto your raft is creative and fun. I have spent around 15 hours upgrading and expanding my raft with full creative freedom, and I cannot wait to explore even more of this already big pile of content. The game has a perfect mixture of laid back and intense elements, I cannot wait to spend more time sailing the sea and would recommend this game to anyone who would love to drift away and explore"
19512,This game is really fun and there are different areas you can find that will suprise you

19523,"9 hours of actual gameplay
The rest goes to floating in the vast ocean."
19524,"Bad first impression;

Full of bugs, random teleporting around the world, loading into empty world/saves and tools that break and makes the player/controls unresponsive. A little too early access.

The concept is very cool, however, and I might revisit the game when it releases. Refunded it for now."
19525,funy
19526,so much fun when I go on trips I miss it
19527,it is good

19530,"Although a fun game played solo, I would recommend playing with at least 1 or 2 friends for a great experience. Levelling up items and getting new materials and items to make tasks easier is very self-satisfying and the dangerous challenge of getting those things makes it all the worth while. Overall, the game-play is calm, funny and has just the right amount of tension to keep a player worried about supplies or the shark; it is also fairly addicting if you don't watch the time. 10/10 would recommend for anyone looking for a break from ordinary survival games and something with fun mixed in. (Hot tip, clay and sand will get you far towards the beginning)."

19533,"Nice to play together, nice environment. A bit stressful sometimes."

19541,I would 100% recommend for other players. This game is just amazing. Such a great way to spend with friends having a laugh and a thrilling time. The quality of this game is astonishing.. All of the textures are just amazing! And I even use the lowest settings cause my PC is caput :D. 100% worth the money and your while. Hop on in for lots of fun times :)
19542,"For sure this game is good, 10/10. Way more fun with friends, Im a base, survival guy so this is great. I do wish that it was on other platforms like, Xbox, PlayStation, etc. Other than that, overall a very good game."

19560,I love Raft. It didn't start out that way. I starved. I dehydrated. I was killed by boar. I was killed by rock-birds. I was eaten by shark. I drowned. I lost my inventory repeatedly. I rage quit. Then I tried Easy mode instead of normal or hard and that made all the difference. I was able to keep my inventory if I died. Riding the waves became a calming experience. Exploring the islands was fun and interesting. Building and decorating my raft was a joy. Exploring the major locations was exciting. I was able to build my skills and learn the game on Easy mode. I can't wait for Chapter 3!

The game itself is where you have to grind forever but i think if you play it with friends you can get alot of stuff going.

19590,Very well thought survival game with interesting story. The gameplay is very simple and easy to control. I found it very relaxing to play. You also can play it with friends. A very recommended game for chilling and vibing.
19591,stab shark with stick
19592,Mix it with Witch It and you get Sea Of Thieves.
19593,"I am addicted to survival/crafting games and Raft has quickly became my favorite!

Pros
*** This game is beautiful. The color and details are simply stunning. I really felt like I was on a raft in the middle of the ocean.
*** The ability to organize everything with the storage boxes kept my brain happy. 
*** With the paint mill, the raft is easily customizable. My raft is purple with pink beams and blue machines :)
*** The different modes allow you to take a break from the killer shark and just chill out on the raft if you need a break from being torn limb-from-limb.
***Crafting was easy to figure out and the research table shows you what to collect to open more recipes.

Cons:
*** There are only 2 character options, but in first person you don't see your character anyway.       
*** Story progression is slow and there are really no hints. If you are the type of gamer that likes quests that hold your hand, you won't find that in Raft. It's up to you to figure it out.
*** The dangerous animals are very hard to kill. If your not up for a challenge, you may not want to play normal or above because you will die and lose your inventory over and over again. 

Overall, this game has everything a survival game should have. There is suspense, heart-pounding action, and the chance for some peaceful ocean views.

19595,"Raft is a very fun game when you have friends to play with but its not so fun when you only play alone.
its a 8/10 when playing with friends and 3/10 when playing alone."
19596,"This is more of the same, gather materials, eat, drink and repeat. The gameplay gets repetitive way too fast, i like the flow of the game but after an hour I just couldn't see myself playing another game like this again."
19597,"Its a very good survival game, shark is a bit annoying but its a good challenge for an overall relaxed game"

19599,"good game good story 9/10 i wish they develop the game faster can't wait to see until the end. hopefully they put online coop which more 100 people on server and each people can make own raft. have guilds, bases and fight on the sea like pirates. this is very great to me specially im a lonely player i have no friends playing this kind of game. so hopefully i can make friends"

19615,the game is fun to play solo and mutiplayer it is a little anoying when the raft got stuck but all and all it is a great game
19616,i love playing raft because it limits my resources just enough that i have to be smart about what i make but it doesn't hinder my creativity in the slightest
19617,very cool
19618,needs more water
19619,fUN
19620,FUN FOR THE WHOLE FAMILY
19621,"This raft was soo rafty. I died a lot, I cried some, I made friends and lost friends. We didnt complete the full experience yet but we are determined to do so. Its really nice that I dont get charged for every update but that being said I would gladly pay for the next update to be done. We named our Shark Sally didn't realise it should have been Bruce.... ALSO would love for a cat to be added. Thank you."
19622,played it with my ex and actually beat the game. Overall its a really fun engaging game with few bugs and i would definitely recommend it to those who enjoy survival games
19623,a
19624,love this game its super fun and enjoying even with freinds and i can run it on my none gaming laptop (on lowest quality)
19625,awg
19626,I love it so much you can build any tipe of boat
19627,"This game is very fun and entertaining, it can be survival or creative. In survival you build your raft to survive and get blueprints and visit islands and more. In creative you have unlimited resources and can build whatever you want. I HIGHLY recommend."
19628,delicious shark meat mmmmm
19629,Some parts about this game make it less good than other survival games I play (solo) but it is still very addictive and although I'm not too far along I would definitely recommend it to people who like this genera. Not a combat focused game... or is it? I still don't know at all but it's fun and there is plenty of danger. Quite a grind just to keep your hunger and thirst down so don't think you'll be leisurely sitting around. What at first seemed like weaker elements of the game soon became a driving force to keep you on your toes and on the move. I like the pace of the game even if it is a little grueling at first. I bet it would be a little easier in multiplayer. My biggest fear is that once I play through the majority of the content that there won't be any reason to play it again. I hope I'm wrong about that though. I'll update my review once I know although I doubt anyone will ever read it.
19630,The story is good. But after you finish the story you just to the same tasks over and over again.
19631,THE HIT GAME RAFT is easily the greatest game I’ve ever played. Aimlessly drifting around the ocean with friends is a 10/10 experience and encourages deep conversations about circumcision.
19632,"boat
"
19633,Boring and tedious.
19634,"Эта игра - какая-то шутка.
В игре,которая основана на путешествиях на плоту - совершенно не реализована механика паруса.На одном маленьком парусе что плот в 10 блоков,что в 1000 плывет одинаково.Более того,ставить более одного паруса бессмысленно.Скорости это не даёт.Браво.Даже в Донт старве,игре,в которой плот явно не на первом плане - механика паруса реализирована лучше.Больше парусов - больше скорости.
Один мотор может вытянуть до 100 блоков.При чем эти блоки - только пол.Мотору всё равно,если я построю 99 полов и целую крепость на них.Он вытянет,игнорируя какой либо вес других построек.Бред.
Дальность прорисовки,а особенно бинокль - какой-то троллинг.В ИГРЕ ПЕРСОНАЖ КАКОГО ТО ЧЁРТА ВИДИТ ДАЛЬШЕ И ЛУЧШЕ ПЕРИФЕРИЙНЫМ ЗРЕНИЕМ.Прямо перед вами остров.Но вы его не видите.Не хватает дальности прорисовки.Поворачиваетесь боком - видите.Ну,думаешь,сделаю бинокль,буду высматривать острова БИНОКЛЕМ.Делаешь его - А ОН ВООБЩЕ НИЧЕГО НЕ ДАЕТ.Ну то есть дальности прорисовки вообще никакой.Зачем нужен бинокль?
Зачем нужен пластик и пальмовые листы?Кроме начала конечно же.Построив основание плота,для которого нужен пластик,пластик становится практически бесполезен и тратить его в больших кол-вах некуда.Тоже самое и с пальмовыми листами.Их особенно много.Что пластика,что листов я уже викинул наверное тысячи.Так же бесполезны и гнезда чаек с их перьями.Стрелы лутаются с трупов.Если хотя бы иногда засаживать огород под открытым небом - уже с избытком этих перьев.А гнезда дают перья..Смысл этих гнезд только в том,чтобы убивать самому чаек туда прилетающих для мяса.
Оптимизация мусор.Говорить больше нечего.
Игра откровенно сырая и очень простая.В ней делать нечего.Почему в этой игре почти за 2 года так отвратно реализована механика парусов и почему еще нет какого-нибудь топ-паруса за 100-500 канатов мне тоже не понятно.И не понятно,почему нет большого применения пластику,листам и перьям уже с середины игры-лэйта.При учете конечно же что ловушки уже построил.Если так посмотреть - смогу рекомендовать игру не раньше апдейта двадцатого.А пока что игра сыра,неоптимизированна и непродуманна.

Спустя более полугода перепрошел игру.Когда игру уже знаешь она проходится еще быстрее и становится еще больше очевидно насколько в игре мало контента.Игра проходится за день,максимум два.Продуктивность создателя - глава раз в год.Реального времени эта глава займет максимум час-два игры.На данный момент вышел реновейшн апдейт.Можно пожалуйста сделать глубины в геймплее и игровых механиках,а не в декорациях?Ну,видимо нет.
Как и сказал,видимо игра станет играбельной не раньше 20 апдейта,а судя по активности разработчиков это не раньше чем лет через 5.
КОНТЕНТА НЕТ,ДЕЛАТЬ НЕЧЕГО."
19635,very fun if you want to explore and have a adventure and story game. Also fun as a survival game. And with the new renovation update its fun to build and decorate your raft too.
19636,Its fun :(
19637,"game good, a bit tedious, needs more updates, closest game to minecraft and teraria (chill game with building and crafting)"
19638,"Been stranded in a raft since 6 years, no bob and no vagene, all i can do is look up the sky and the wish, i just wanted friends....."
19639,"This game is really fun and with friends even better. The crafting system is one of the better one's I've seen, pve can be hard but you learn how to work around it and make it easier. Most importantly have fun play the game you want to play it building is very simple and easy to figure out."
19640,"Great storyline and easy to play and have fun along with friends. Do not enjoy it as much playing alone. The game however is very well designed, open world and with many tasks and features."
19641,0/10 no water
19642,it good and it fun to play with friends
19643,"I forget when or where I got this game, but It's alright I guess. 
Quite unpolished. Sound design sucks. 

Still, a decent game I guess. Kind of expected a bit more of the pioneer of this genre though."
19644,Very fun and calming but can be very stressful. The start of every run is different and always keeps you on your toes. I play this all the time in my free time.
19645,yaaaaaaaaaaaaaaas
19646,👍
19647,delicious game i eated the shark
19648,"sure

19649,"Great survival game with a chill atmosphere. i love the artstyle and the litle things like how peacefull mode doesn't just dissable combat, but instead makes engaging with it up to the player. cant wait to see what the developers will add next."
19650,Very good base base building and a very chilled vibe

19653,the story of this game is really deep
19654,Been playing with some friends and it's definitely a game to play with people and not alone.
19655,"Just NO.

Got it on sale didn't play it till it was past the return date, would have returned.

If you like survivors I guess this one is what ever."

19660,"Very peaceful and chill game. Definitely recommend playing with others. Main story was as fun as just working on your raft. Can't wait for future expansions in the story. Game also very robust (had no crashes so far). 

Minor bugs that need to be fixed like the Toggle Sprint option gets reset every time you log out."
19661,"This game is very inaccurate, not enough plastic in the ocean."
19662,"Wonderful survival crafting game, particularly with friends.  Only a few story islands so far, but more coming hopefully soon!  I'd recommend picking it up!"

19710,IT GOOD
19711,I was playing raft with some close friends and all of a sudden I fell through the map and it literally messed everything up. we would open chests and they would forever be on our screen. we left to come back thinking it would fix it but all of our worlds are completely gone. any progress we had everything is completely gone. it is a fun relaxing game but one glitch for us made us loose absolutely everything.

19725,my balls hurt after playing this game and i used to play with my baby boy but hes left me for better things :( so i recommend playing this game with massive balls and a good friend.
19726,"Very addicting - and much more fun with at least one other friend! ONE CAVEAT: The hunger and thirst bars are insanely annoying on ""Normal"" mode, which is the only reason we are using ""Easy"" mode. It's an unrealistic amount of food you go through on ""Normal"" lol. Easy is way more accurate, IMO. We had to compromise, losing the difficulty of fighting certain creatures (easier now), but it was well worth it to not be constantly in a panic to eat a feast every 5 minutes. We couldn't do literally anything else other than fish, cook, chop trees, purify water - basically no time to actually enjoy the game."
19727,repetitive gameplay and if you die at the start you mainly won't survive.
19728,lag for multiplayer
19729,It is a really fun game and i would really recommend it
19730,it is a very fun game to play with friends
19731,I would say this game is better if you have others to play it with you however if you play it solo. Like I have tried to it might not be as enjoyable for you. I found that out after playing it just for over a hour but by the time I found out it wasn't for me. My time to try to get my money back was to late so it's just collecting dust in my steam folder of unplayed games.
19732,This is a fun game but there are some glitches for example the shark (Karen) wouldn't spawn until i went to an island I would turn around and my raft was gone when it was anchored down.
19733,is gud

"
19773,"if you have friends that you would like to debate with over the stupidest things like, who killed the shark, who gets to reel in the barrel floating out in the water, or even how your rft should look, its a really fun game."

19787,i love this game its really fun to play.
19788,"Absolutely amazing game!

I love the progression and items you and your friends can strive to build as well as expanding your raft.

The story islands are interesting and I like that the only AI on them are enemies. I feel this works best as if there were AI people that you could talk to it would remove that feeling of independent progression and survival.

Knowing that you or you and your friends are the only humanoids on this flooded world really interests me. It is such a relaxing and fun game!

Can't wait for the next chapter!!"
19789,It's COol

19827,"I would recommend this to people that enjoy games like minecraft, Exploring games, and survival."
19828,good
19829,very good very nice
19830,"I absolutely recommend this game.

I HATE the ocean and ocean related games, however the feel of this game and the exploration you can do makes this game more tranquil than I first thought. 

In my experience you can play this game alone, however it makes exploring certain islands difficult if you're not equipped for them. I personally love playing with friends as it makes the game a bit more enjoyable and funny when exploring. 

The decoration options for your raft are really nice, you can make it personalized and cute or functional for you and friends..or both!"
19831,raft gud
19832,good game +1
19833,good
19834,all i feel like saying is that it is a survivle game where you stuck out in the sea being relentlessly hunted my a shark
19835,This game is incredible cant wait for chapter 3!
19836,THIS IS THE BEST GSME EVER
19837,I like it

19842,great game
19843,"Played this with friends, it's how I'm reviewing it.


***EDIT***
We've finally completed all the chapters and completed a ton of goals and achievements - still a crap ton to go, do, and see.
Highly recommended even with it's flaws.
*************

Such a chill, fun and entertaining game. Myself, along with my spouse and two friends loaded up and started our adventure. We've laughed, screamed and worked together in great ways.

Takes a bit of time to figure out the best ways to do certain things, but once you get a motion going, it's quite interesting. Our raft has grown and is almost self-sustaining. We have key roles that everyone does while sailing, and other roles we take on when exploring land masses.

I can't wait to see what else the game brings, the mechanics, the creatures, adventures and even lore. It's all fantastic so far and kudos to the Dev(s).

Very much recommended if you want a nice relaxing adventure."
19844,yes
19845,it is good
19846,payed the amount wont let me in the game
19847,gud game
19848,its a really fun game especially when you are with your freinds the story line is just grat i rate it 10/10

19869,games fun so far i like the plot
19870,"once you die you are basically fucked, there is no way to get your stuff back and its basically like starting fresh. Making you spend another 2 hours getting all your stuff back just to die again. I do not recommend, the sharks are so annoying and have way to much health."
19871,its a really good game.
19872,"-
"
19873,"This game cured me of covid, hunger and sleep at the same time. 

Though in all seriousness it did get me through a rough patch and I've been absolutely addicted to it. If you're an explorer type gamer always chasing that next island just in case it has something interesting on it then this is for you. I've just been playing on peaceful mode drifting about with my pet shark, but in the brief time on normal mode it can be an intense survival challenge if that's what you're into. 

There's even a creative mode if you just want to build a floating castle, though yes if you need a long and strong narrative (or a tutorial... I just got dumped in the middle of the sea with literally nothing) you wont get that here. It's more a make your own story and see what's going on in the background lore as you go type of game. It's a well polished if simple gem with lots of little surprising details, definitely worth the price. Cant wait to see where it goes."
19874,fun
19875,"Great game, has those cartoony graphics I love that are similar to Sea of Thieves. Addictive style game with an above average story-line. Only down side to this game are the crazy amount of bugs. However, the game IS in Beta and they warn you of the bugs, and to be honest, nearly none of them are game breaking just an inconvenience.

19876,"very dumb but very fun

19880,HUAAAAGH
19881,its fun and its easy to learn the controls
19882,bruce >:(
19883,"Well... first game, went to first island. was gonna start a farm with my singular potato. i pressed tab to craft a hammer, and suddenly, there was only ocean and the night sky.
I crafted a hammer to at least make a raft: nothing
I drank salt water to quench some thirst: nothing
seeing my end, without a shark to end it faster, i built a campfire so that i could at-least point into the horizon as a last hurrah.

this is probably just the game tutorial letting me know life is pain and you grow from pain to learn for next run, and honor those that risked their lives before you."
19884,its fun
19885,very very fun
19886,this game is heat bro
19887,"Fun base building with some story, adventure and puzzles.  What's not to like."

19889,i have a fear of the ocean
19890,amazing game fun to play and open world exploration
19891,"I can't express how good the story mode is on this game! Fun with friends, can design the raft however you want, and if you like puzzles this is a great game because there are a lot of puzzles and mysterious endings. Can't wait till they had more to the story mode soon."

19931,fun with friends :D
19932,The Rennovation Update is great until Bruce takes a bite out of your boat 10/10 game
19933,"Shorty Short: Recommended with a bit of caution. Its a fun game for survival enthusiasts who also like chill. Great with a friend/s, sometimes a bit lonely as a soloist. Careful if you have motion sickness, turn that on in the settings so the rocking waves don't get ya. Needs serious optimization as it runs too hard even on higher end computers (important note written further below). Tips on how to start/difficulty further below too.

This game wears its heart on its sleeve. It is as you see it, lost at sea with minor guidance and a hook in hand with an angy shark trying to eat your boat. STOP EATING THE BOAT, BRUCE! Anyway, I find myself more amused by yelling at the only real friend you have in the game, a cranky shark, than anything else. The raft building can be fun at times though, especially if you have some whacky ideas. 

The exploration is a bit hit or miss, as the combat controls feel a little sluggish and things can hurt you pretty good. You'll find yourself battling your own hunger/thirst meter more so then anything else in game. The game is charming and is impressive for such a small dev team and they truly love their game as they've poured a lot of QoL changes, more content and more decorative things to amuse players with. There is a story you will follow and progress through, leading to some of the most useful equipment for your raft. The story is alright, you get a sense of what has happened and what people were trying to do to avert/avoid the crisis, as well as just survive after it. It seems they've been working on improving it and it shows in the latest update a bit.

IMPORTANT NOTE: I would like to point out this game has some serious optimization issues. I would make sure your video card is limited to 60fps or so with this one as the physics engine could really use more tweaking. Unity can always be a bit of a hog, but Raft is a special case as you can even see in discussion topics. Raft can run my old graphics card harder than a modded Fallout 4 game with a lightweight enb, just sayin'. AND it seems to be even worse for higher-end systems, so thats a thing thats weird to say. So that is my hope to the devs; I love the game and have a lot more hours into it than on Steam, but please.. please please work on that optimization soon. I know content is important, but so is not melting down computers.

Little tips for people wanting to check it out:

If you go it alone- I recommend playing on easy as its a lot more manageable for your first couple of times playing, The shark can be your biggest obstacle or even smacking into an island and getting stuck WITHOUT a paddle or means to make one.. I personally usually play on Easy or Normal depending on my mood for solo games. You don't lose items on you if you die so its not such a chore if you do.

With more experience as a Solo player, Normal mode is a nice challenge for those who would like the game to keep them on their toes even more. For the most part it just means the shark attacks more frequently and your hunger/thirst go down a bit quicker.. which can be annoying to manage early game and can easily end your run without it. You also lose anything on you when you die and have to respawn (in multiplayer a friend can drag you to bed so you don't lose items.. solo, well.. no friend, much loss.)

For Multiplayer, I'd recommend Normal for starters and then eventually Hard if you really want it annoying. Babysitting the hunger/thirst stats more than anything else can get old after several, several hours of doing it, but the game feels too easy otherwise with 3 or more players if ""easy"" is something you don't like, that is."

Pls stop hitting me with rocks it hurts.

                           -Me :)

Edit: 2.5 hours, still worth it.  Early game is kinda slow and boring, just picking stuff up from the water. But once you get further into the game you get a stable supply of food and water (Just 2 water purifiers and 1 grill, fishing never fails to get the food) you can actually start to build up your raft and explore. :) Good job devs!

    Edit: 6.4 hours.....

19982,Would recommend
19983,I very well enjoyed playing this game
19984,i like it
19985,"Took 30 hours to from brand new player to finishing all the story content and building my own nice big floating home.

There is a good wiki, but you can complete the game without using it.

Quite a nice base building game, bright colours, some pretty randomly generated islands, and some designed story islands.

You start gaining resources slowly, but that increases as you improve your raft, gives a nice sense of progression.

A shark will attack your raft, but once you learn to armour plate your edges then the game gets a lot more relaxing.

It's not the best base building game, but I enjoyed my time with it."

20017,"I have been playing Raft since its beta
This is one of my favourite family games. i play it regularly with my 9 year old daughter and my wife. The best part is that it develops a strong sense of teamwork, and unlike other survival games restricts you to a specific area.
The story is intriguing and involved. It is relaxing, and yet intense.
IT is a polished game that is still being maintained and expanded upon... worth the price, and wroth the time."

20040,"The start is great, everything after Vasagatan makes me bored out of my mind"
20041,good game to play with friends and relax
20042,this game is about strategy on how you conserve your hunger/thirst :) its very fun
20043,"this is very addictive and veryu time consumming and helps when your bored and have a lot of time please play if you have it i have played over 73 hours

20051,"Very fun to play with friends and it is a good sandbox experience.

20052,"its a great game to play with friends, but not by yourself, that's just my opinion though."
20053,"just amazing, no words"
20054,Amazing game Highly reccomend
20055,"Didn't think I would like it, I mean a Raft game!? Now I'm totally in love with the game:)"
20056,i became god
20057,i think raft is a bit boring when you play alone however when you play with somebody it is very fun
20058,long raft go scoop
20059,Fun to play with friends ^^
20060,poggers game go brrrrr
20061,
20062,"Really enjoyable game! There's a large story to the game, islands to find, animals to collect, resources to collect, and more! You can rarely get hats from mobs which are nice to collect. I love building, which can get a little boring after a while, but all the islands with animals to collect and loot to dig up really makes up for it!"
20063,fire asf... it does not look like much but it is so fun
20064,"I like the concept of the game. 

I am really hooked on the game. It's fun specially when you play it with friends.

A lot of things to do. We have no time to be idle. Story is nice and mini puzzles are fun to solve. 

Character Customization is my only recommendation. Other than that Game is Solid 10'10
"
20065,good game get game
20066,boat
20067,"You cannot stay still for even a single second in this game. My raft got stuck in an island and i couldn't do anything. If i tried to get items, i'd die. If i swam to the items, the shark would kill me. If managed to somehow dodge around the shark or have RNG not make him attack me as much, i'd get a few things and then go back to my raft. I'd then stand on top of the raft, trying to store my things in the box - and then instantly die due to a bird i think? Something. Either the shark clipped through the raft to kill me or a bird killed me somehow. I'd just randomly die. I now have to restart just to do something. Because there was nothing i could have done. I tried to make a paddle yes but i could never do it because if i somehow miraculously got plastic i'd just get sniped by god himself when storing it or crafting a paddle. This isn't difficult it's just dumb."
20068,"TLDR: So fun! Very, very polished for an early access game. A bit grindy, but if you like a bit of a challenge, it's for you.

The story is great, locations are engaging, building is creative. Kind of hard to get going but once you understand what is important, it's easy to master. I usually die a few time at the very beginning of a new run, but once I get established I can survive hundreds of days. TRYING to wait patiently for the new update to play again....... :-P Dev team is always updating, or posting about updates. I'm always weary of early access games, but this is SO polished. Good graphics, no crashing. Definitely grindy, but that's a game I like *cough* I have at least a thousand hours across Minecraft Bedrock and Java *couch*I would 100% recommend this."
20069,Its Amazing
20070,Really fun with friends but can get boring alone. It is easy to get the hang of and really lets you explore the world around you.

20091,great game
20092,This game is good
20093,"When this first came out it was really fun for me. At the time I was playing with my boyfriend so I do recommend playing with at least 1 friend more will be way more fun. Granted the game now is full of newer content and that's a super plus. 
I enjoy playing with MODS as I find it feels more like mine-craft in a way. The exploring has always been a HUGE fun factor for me. In any type of game I play I am always that one who wanders off to explore and potentially die, but worth it.
The Graphics are cute and easy to understand. The HUD is acceptable although could use some work.
I personally would love to see a bit more vibrant colours and sharper edges. Personal preference.
The flow of the mechanics is smooth. Glitches. Yes. LoL! Vanishing Raft...it happened. 
I think this game is better if played without feeling like it is a serious game to ""Win"" just enjoy it for what it is, fun goofy, and better with friends. Speaking of...I gotta make more friends who want to play this with me now! 
Goal: to play with Max amount of people for a session. Also I want to build a super Raft! with a Hippo Pond!"
20094,good
20095,"good game long story linr
"
20096,"The game is a lot of grinding, especially on single player, if you can I would recommend playing with at least 1-2 friends, company and extra help.  It's a long process getting things going but like said with friends it makes the game more fun and takes away from that constant rush feeling. Tip for playing, food and water go down quick, and food is really bad with more people, make sure you at least get a better purifier, saves planks and you can do more at once, always refill it, keep planks well stocked, and overall have fun from there, keep small fish, you'll want it for bait later."

20120,yap GET NOW!!!!!
20121,"Very fun game, short story hoping to be updated soon. Reccomend"
20122,"I really want to like this game, but I don't. The idea of survival, and building up your own ship sounds awesome, but the experience of it is boring. 

The interface is terrible. It feels like an old game in all the wrong ways. Combat is rudimentary, and hit detection is unreliable. 

One of the later game elements is capturing animals. You'll put lots of resources into capturing a single animal, but sometimes animals that you've put lots of time into, named and cared for will simply disappear, despite fencing and placing them in safe places. 

It requires too much out-of-game research to figure out how the game wants you to play it, rather than being intuitive, or having helpful in-game tips. I may give it a bit more time and update my review if things improve, but so far, it seems like a skunk of a game."
20123,VERY FUN TO PLAY WITH FRENDS BUT ONCE YOUVE FULLLY FINISHED IT YOUR DONE
20124,That shark bit my heenie

20135,good game :)
20136,i played this and me and my friend wanna play together so shes ganna save for it so we can play together. i suggest so I say you can play alone but also with friends.
20137,I very well recommend this since its one of my favorite survival sim and if you like semi intense games with mystery and the permit of being able to have animals on your raft.
20138,"I used to not be able to play this game when I initially bought it because I would get motion sickness but since the game has incorporated motion sickness, FOV and third-person capabilities, it's allowed me to play it without getting sick and I hope it's done the same for people who have the same difficulty I do playing first-person games!

The game is fairly smooth and well-thought out as I enjoy games that require building and crafting. The game is fairly easy, relaxing and you don't need to focus on it much, easily making it one of the best co-op games I've played. The developers seem to have more to offer and cannot wait to see what will be released next!"
20139,Very nice sounds and all game
20140,"Love this game, so fun with friends and there's so much to do :) it runs a lot smoother with lower graphic rendering but I'm sure the high quality is beautiful if you've got the setup. It doesn't make the game any less enjoyable either way. Highly recommend!"

20177,so halal mode
20178,"Fun survival game to play with friends. The soundtrack is so relaxing and I cannot wait for it to be a fully fleshed out game. We hit the end of the story content available to us at the time in the game, it only took around 20-25 hours, but it's an interesting world to learn the story of through exploration. 

One unfortunate problem to overcome is that the larger you make the raft, the more likely it is to have parts of it submerged due to waves. We started building up a new top deck above the base deck to counter this, as it's weird to be in your raft then underwater due to a wave. Basically once your raft gets too long, the physics get weird. Of course IDK if you were ever intended to make a cruise liner out of sea garbage haha.

Unlike Minecraft or Valheim, or other survival games with creative building mechanics, you are a little limited in building by the wave issue, and that you only have your one raft vs expanding to new bases or building up and out for as far as you want. I think it would be neat if the devs added a mechanic to tie separate rafts together so they all interacted with the physics of the waves individually, or maybe even made a ""home island"" patch someday to be a bit of an endgame, where you build on land but still use the raft to gather materials. 

That suggestion aside, this is absolutely worth buying. It's just the type of game that makes you smile, AND you can enjoy it with friends. I would expect an easy 25 hours of entertainment, likely to expand over the course of development."

20189,yes
20190,This game is not too bad. This game is way more fun with a friend or 2 but even solo is fun. The eventual raft upgrades you reach and new updates comming every so often its a great way to spend your time.

a word of warning though: if you have a ryzen 5000 CPU your temps will go through the roof almost instantly upon loading the game. i really really hope the devs sort this out, it's not a demanding game at all and it shouldn't be happening. if you are having overheating issues, try switching your power profile to ""power saving"" in your windows settings while you are playing the game. this fixed my issue instantly without any hit to the game quality."

20233,Raft is an incredible chill and relaxing little survival game. perfect to play while watching something else or just chilling. so fun to just drift through the ocean slowly unlocking and discovering better technology for your raft/ boat. also the story and slowly discovering all the islands and points of interest is very fun! cant wait to see more from this game in future updates

20256,This is the greatest ocean exploration of All Time. This game is great and even better with friends. There's a big grind if you make it one or you can get by quickly. Sadly there are only a small amount of story islands to explore but it's still in development. Can't wait for more chapters. 10/10 would play again!

20273,"Have really enjoyed getting to play this game with my partner in an LDR. Is a fun challenge getting used to the mechanics of the game and whilst not overly complex there's enough elements to keep you playing. The story locations are ok with some interesting puzzles however if it weren't for the new unlocks I'm not sure how much I would bother with them. Although my Girlfriend who enjoys lore quite enjoyed some of the notes.
Would definately recommend picking this game up and I feel that at this price you'd be stupid not to."
20274,"Over all this is one of the BEST survivor games I have played. There is a a lot of content and the idea of building a raft from ocean trash is fantastic. The game play can require some help if you go down and need to be revived, other than that you can play solo with no issues. There are secrets in this game and only playing it will show you them. They do keep releasing story line, so stay tuned for more game content. 10/10 on this game."
20275,one of my all time favorites but i play on laptop and you need to mess with the graphics in setting to even make this game playable but its 100000000 percent worth it in all a awesome game

20301,"Raft is an unfinished game. The game consists of a 4x4 platform, with which you hook items in the never-ending ocean to expand your ""raft"" and find new islands and explore the 1/4th of a story it features. In it's current state, the game is unfinished, and offers little-to-none gameplay other than building. It is full of bugs, the graphics are not extremely good, and overall the game looks unfinished, and probably shouldn't have been released. On the other hand, it doesn't seem like the developers do much to update it anyways, so maybe they thought that it would be a good idea to release an unfinished project and charge 20$ for it? 
There is some gameplay, though, and it is possible to play lightheartedly with some friends, but don't expect anything special or over the top from this game."

2. Warning anyone who is not to old make just a heads up that when you get to a few parts of the games lore/storyline/when you get the radio signal thing, is that there are some very hideous cameolian rat lizard things called lurkers that are kinda scary when you first start seeing them so i would say after all the games quite good when your not in a dark area in a building and the music i quite i would say the game is 9/10"

20380,"I love Raft, it's an amazing game, with plenty to do.
Some pro's: for me the motion sickness setting + changing FOV is a true blessing, as I get motion sick in a lot of other games (such as Minecraft). Personally, I love when games give you freedom to do what you want + a storyline to keep everything structured. 
Con: This might be just me, but playing solo killing certain enemies, especially the screecher, is quite difficult. Would also love a bit more character customization possibilities (though I think this might be in the works). Once you finished the chapters, there is less to keep you going, but then again it is only 20euro and the game is still in development.

Overall, I suggest this game to everyone and I'm looking forward to the next chapter!!"

20386,One of the best game i've played with my Girlfriend can't wait for the 2 other maps  but its taking forever !
20387,"In terms of gameplay, its smooth and good. In terms of fun... not much fun (for me anyways), it’s a really stale game with nothing to really entice you. I got it back when it first came out, refunded it, then got it again on sale and still not worth. es there is more things to do and content but story is not done, and nothing really is exciting. Fine for some relaxation. Creator mode would benefit the game if the added one."

20399,"This game is amazing!

PROS:
-  This game has an AMAZING soundtrack. I'd compare it to the minecraft soundtrack in quality, and nostalgia. 
-  This game has great graphics. I have a potato for a PC(I don't even have a GPU), and at the lowest graphics settings possible, I can still run this at 60 fps AND the game still beautiful. 
-  There's no limit. You can make and do whatever you want.
-   The story line is awesome. Without spoiling anything, the story line gives you something to reach for, and a way to progress in the game. If I am ever feeling bored, I can always do something story line related. 
-   It's just fun, there's an endless amount of things you can do, and I never feel bored. There's always something new to do on the raft. 

CONS:
-  At times, when loading something very large, the game will start to lag, but if you have a decent PC, you'll be fine. 
-  It may be difficult to progress without using the Raft Wiki. Now,  this isn't a bad thing, I use it all the time, but if you're someone who would consider this ""cheating"" you MIGHT have a hard time. Emphasis on ""might"", I'm sure if you tried hard enough you could get every achievement in the game without ever looking at the Wiki.

Overall, this game is great. It has a  great soundtrack, great story line, great graphics(even at low levels), and is always entertaining."

20436,even for playing the game for a short amount of time it is so amazing!
20437,"I love this game, the only downside is that is it not as fun playing alone as it is with friends."
20438,"I have a lot of hours in this game. I usually play a lot of city builder games and the sims, however from time to time I find a good sandbox game I enjoy. This is 100% one of those games. For a game that is early access and unfinished, It's fantastic. The development is slow but honestly even with the story mode unfinished, I still enjoy every minute I play of the game. 

I've been playing since before the cruise ship was added and it was just the first part of the story, and this game has came a long way since then. I appreciate that the developers have taken the time to listen to feedback, especially about adding a motion sickness mode since I get sick super easily. 

The game does have it's ""quirks"", most of them are just the seagulls. If you enjoy just having a game to take your time in, this game will be for you. There isn't a clock, there isn't a rush for you to get to the end of the game. You just relax and enjoy the ocean and collect trash and from time to time get murdered by a shark. 

My only real gripe is I wish when you died your items would get stored into a container or something for you to pick them up. Currently if you are a single mode player the only way to not lose your stuff if you die is to play on easy or have someone else join your world and revive you."
20439,Super relaxing to explore in peaceful mode.
20440,"Raft comes at a very reasonable price, and as a result of that, I bought it expecting something perhaps a little dull. I was pleasantly surprised with Raft and so far have really enjoyed playing it together with my friends.

Between the abandoned rafts and islands we have had plenty to explore, and plenty to do with customizing and even painting and decorating our raft.

Fishing has provided us with items such as boots which we have used as plant pots and scattered nicely over our raft. We each have our own room and have actually made a very homely raft, which has been great to let our creativity flow.

Although I can see that unless there are more updates soon, the game could become pretty stale quickly, I definitely see this as a game that will be great to come back to and play following updates."

20463,"This is the first steam game I have ever gotten, and I must say it is worth buying. 

While it is a relatively simple open world survival game, it is very fun, especially with multiplayer. it is a bit slow to start up a good world in survival, but after that point it's smooth sailing (no pun intended). 

A major thing to praise about this game is that despite the fact most of it takes place in water, the land gameplay isn't as frustating as... a certain expansion that turned into a full-on sequel halfway through development that I have also reviewed. [spoiler]Ok, Subnautica Below Zero is complete garbage. STOP F**KING PRAISING THAT GAME, THE LAND GAMEPLAY IS SO BAD, AND IT WASTES SO MUCH TIME. For a game called SUBNAUTICA, which quite literally means BELOW WATER, HALF OF IT TAKES PLACE ON LAND. HOW IS THERE A FANBASE?! In this game, the land gameplay is essential, BUT IN BELOW ZERO, YOU CAN COMPLETELY SKIP AN ENTIRE PORTION OF THE DISJOINTED STORY AND PLAY IN THE WATER. Also, WHY IS THE MAP SO SMALL?!? The fact that there is land everywhere and the map is so f**king small just gets rid of the mystery factor of not knowing where you are or where to go, BUT HERE, LETS ADD F**KING ISLANDS EVERYWHERE BECAUSE THAT'S """"""""""GOOD"""""""""" GAME DESIGN!!!! Yeah there are islands here, but that is part of the survival! The islands that appear serve as a resource cache, and once again, are essential to the gameplay and story. THE FACT THAT THERE ARE ISLANDS EVERYWHERE IN BELOW ZERO, HOWEVER, NOT ONLY DOESN'T FIT THE TONE OF THE GAME, BUT THEY HAVE NO RESOURCES WHATSOEVER!!!! F**K BELOW ZERO, F**K ROBIN AYOU, F**K TRIVALVES, AND SHADOW LEVIATHANS CAN LICK MY NUTS!!![/spoiler]

Overall, Raft is a fun survival game that definitely deserves a playthrough. 8/10"

i've ACTUALLY got itto work, and i've been going sun up till sun down lol, it's actually a great game, there is a caveat to this however, i would like to advise, if you get motion/sea sickness, then this game will definitely not be for you, as there is high waves, and i have to admit, i freak out a little bit when the waves go over my head, mainly because i have beeen in drowning accidents over the years ( i nearly drowned twice). as for the game itself, i would recommend watching a lets play, on YT. im recommending this, as a survival fan, and building."

20495,"The game is enjoyable and definitely more doable with friends.  You need to ensure your team is doing their assigned tasks and keeping the wee little shark and other critters at bay.
There are a number of minor glitches that can be irksome but overall have not found any that are truly game breaking.
Story line could do with development, however if story line is not something you are worried about and want a change in the standard survival genre then Raft scratches the itch."

20503,"its a good game single player but your progress will be a lot slower and you have to be much more cautious of danger. multiplayer is really fun tho, you don't have to worry abt losing your world if you die bc you'll have someone to revive you and you can gather more materials and expand faster. The game mechanics are good and if you don't like what a key is set to you can change it in settings. over all its a good game, i just think its better with friends."

20521,"Recommended, but barely.  If you keep a small raft, the game is fine, it's more a slice of life game than a survival game once you've got your ""sea legs"" under you.  

However, the game engine runs on a single processor core, causing severe limitations in frame rate, as it also doesn't use the GPU for anything.  This causes some pretty amazingly low FPS with a larger raft, and can get bad enough that raft either has to be scaled back (due to unability at 4 fps - it's playable at 6 to 8 fps).

As a note - these FPS counts are with the following specs:
Processor	Intel i9-9980XE CPU @ 3.00GHz, 3000 Mhz, 18 Core(s), 36 Logical Processor(s)
 (RAM)	64.0 GB
RTX 3090

It just won't matter.  Everything just run off of 1 core, and leaves the rest of your systems to sit around and do nothing while your frames die."

20529,"I really like this game.

✅️ easy grind 
✅️ no force story following mode.
✅️ multiple difficulties
✅️ no limit to team, if your internet and pc can hold, you cam build as big raft and can have as much friends you want.
✅️ (un)official mods. These are functions added by players them self and developers are not against it.
✅️ cheap for the genre.
✅️ can run even in 10 years old pc.


❎️ even if minimum requirement is potato low, recommended specs is a little high.
❎️ no multiplayer mode even. Only stream friends can join you and only when you are online.

20536,"A blast to play solo and even more fun and productive to play with friends. That shark is crazy though and is 100% tethered to you all the time no matter what which is the only issue I've found with this game. The second your toe touches the water it snaps to your location even if it was nowhere in sight so for solo players I'd recommend playing on easy so at least you don't lose everything you have when you die because you will die, A lot!"

20546,fun with friends and a fun open sandbox game
20547,"I do not recomend this game for single player use. It is very hard to gather resources, water, and food. Also the shark can and will destroy parts of your raft that you worked hard on. For example: I had just created the simple water purifier and 1 raft day later the shark destroyed it. If you are going to play this game then you should play it with another person, you will need someone to help gather materials and fight off shark attaks."

20573,"Do you want to die? Like, a lot? Well, Raft is for you. Raft was given to me by my good friend and fellow Youtuber Santinetic. He asked if we wanted to make a collab video together, and even without the filming we still enjoyed the game a whole lot. The story and building aspects of this game are killer, and the world is so expertly generated that you are bound to progress wherever you go. And the co-op experience is even better, because with friends you can worry less about dying and more about cooperating with two other idiots. This game is great, I would highly recommend."

20600,Amazing game! If you play slow and stoned you can get 30-40 hours out of the in game story.
20601,Shittest game ever spent years making food for there not to be any actual plot point
20602,"a very fun game for your spare time. The story is fun to follow/decipher, the only real drawback is the slow pace of releases. The developers take a very long time to release new chapters. Building the raft is fun but gets boring after a while without advancing to new chapters. overall an 8/10, it just needs more meat on its bones."
20603,its fun and cool  bitch
20604,Oh my gosh! This is so cute and so much fun
20605,It's fun
20606,Absolutely love this game. I have bought it for a few friends XD
20607,best
20608,very good you can explore and build
20609,"One of the things I love most about this game is that you can play it exactly how you want.
If you want to get to the story islands as quickly as possible, you can, if you want to build a unique raft, tend to your needs, your animals and/or your garden, and chill on the ocean, you can. Want to read the story notes or not? They're interesting but not necessary to enjoy the game. It's all up to you.

My favourite part is that the game gently nudges you in the right direction without explicitly telling you what to do or when to do it. There are a couple of small puzzles and a linear progression of the story, but mostly you're just freely running around doing what you feel like and discovering things. If you ever feel stuck or wondering how to progress, you've probably just unlocked a new thing that you didn't pay proper attention to.

I also really like that the universe unfolds by little scraps and hints rather than a completely cohesive story. It feels much more fitting to find bread crumbs, notes, letters, diaries and other remnants along the way that give just enough insight into the world and the characters that used to live in a given location to piece together what happened and add some flavour and personality. They've said that they will be rewriting things in the future, so this wonderful aspect may change into a more traditional straight-forward story, but I really hope not, it would be such a shame.

If you're very efficient-minded and only interested in exploring new locations, you can spend about a week's worth of evenings playing through the current game for the first time, and you may not want to replay it.

If you like to build, gather and collect, you can spend hundreds of hours.

It can be a little difficult to survive in the beginning when you're new and don't know what you're doing, but that makes for a fun and well-balanced challenge. Later on it quickly becomes a mostly relaxing game, where your basic needs are easily managed and you can choose to seek out a little danger, depending on your tastes.

The visual style is fun though a little too lacking in detail. Things are just a tad too blurry up close, but the design of the makeshift items you can make is humorous. Don't look into the cold, dead eyes of the otherwise cute animals.

The music is awesome and the split-second long sunsets are super pretty.

The developers seem committed and you get the impression that the game is a well-loved project, although updates are unfortunately very slow to come out, it's clearly a game made by people who love games.

The price is fair for the amount of content you get, especially with more chapters in the works.

It's nice that there are different difficulty settings, but I would prefer a few toggle options instead or in addition. For instance the risk of spawning extra sharks is a fun challenge but only available on hardmode, where if you die, you can't revive on your own - bad news for a solo player. The infamously annoying seagulls you can only get a break from on peaceful mode, but that also removes a whole chunk of other gameplay. Only easymode lets you keep your inventory if you die, and so on. A few mix 'n' match options would be nice.

Mods pick up most of the slack but there are some fixes that should really be part of the main game instead.

One big con is that the later story islands seem to have been inflated to appear bigger, that is to say, you will be seeing the same few decorations many, many times, encountering lots of big empty facades you can't actually enter or interact with, and looting the same cupboards repeatedly. There's still plenty of things to love about them, but it does seems a little hollow. 

There are also a good amount of things that you would logically want to grab (tools, food, decorations) but you can't interact with any of it at all. A screwdriver? Gimme. A SAW for someone trying to survive by tying planks and plastic together? I would not walk past that. Cute lil' cactus? Yes please. Cheap old plastic chair? Doesn't sound too shabby, actually. Obviously we can't expect the world, but I would have loved to at least be able to grab some of these and place them on my raft. Would make for really nice little hidden gems or even fun mini-games.

The lack of variety in enemies and minor locations is similarly a little bit disappointing, but it's mostly because it's really a nice game that leaves you wanting more.

While I hope we get lots more content, there is already enough to warrant at least one very fun play through, possibly several if you get ""hooked"".

I'm eagerly awaiting chapter 3!"
20610,"It's a great experience, a very unique game and a fun freeworld style game. I enjoy the way this game put being stranded in the ocean and put it's own twist on it with the backstory and everything leading up to beating the game."

20637,"i love water
"
20638,"If your looking for a simple yet challenging survival game then I highly recommend this one,"
20639,"The controls, crafting, and gameplay loop are simple and easy to understand while also containing enough depth and customization to be interesting. The story is decent enough to engage with, which is more than I can say for most games. It's a relaxing and rewarding experience. Solid.

It's also unfinished and not going to be finished. Once you feel like you're done with what the game has to offer don't stick around and wait for the game to update. That's a trap. Just completely forget about it. If you randomly remember it three years down the line maybe there'll be one update, and this game as it stands will need several to be considered ""finished enough."" The updates feel like the difference between one Minecraft snapshot and the very next Minecraft snapshot, except they take years instead of weeks.

But it's fun. It's worth the asking price."

20768,"This is a fantastic game! Its a very relaxed experience with some action scattered about. This is definitely a good game to play with a friend or two but i found the experience more enjoyable by playing solo. If you like exploration/crafting/base building then this should definitely be on your radar. The only issue is that the game is still in early access which means there are parts of the story line that haven't been finished. However that doesn't take away from what content is there, just means you'll have to come back for the updates. Overall i think this is an easy 7-8/10"

New content releasing is very slowly at the moment, so not much to discover once you've completed the two chapters and have every piece of machinery built on your raft along with full decor. A lot of room is left for improvement and It's one of those games that with enough support and budget, it could be played endlessly without you ever getting bored.

20829,"Well, just you, the sea and that basterd shark Bruce. Endless drifting over sea fishing up all the trash and build you own raft. If you like crafting and surviving games, this one is good enough, only mostly on the sea. Shark will NEVER give up on you and keeps you company by stalking and munching pieces away from your raft, not to mention seaguls have an appetite for your precious flowers and crops. But all is manageable if you just stay alert. Investigate places and islands to keep track of your progress and keep upgrading and expanding your raft. 

This game is endless and I hope that the next update is worth the long waiting.

Oh yeah, Bruce says hi.


Edited after the BIG update.
It's finally here! New adventures awaits you. More stuff added, more tricks and obstacles and many more things to keep you busy. Thank you developers!"

20860,Raft is a great game... worth the 20 bucks and now the storyline is complete you all can relax in the game... my review 69 out of 10 game (im joking but im not)
20861,loving every second of Raft!!!  My husband wishes he never bought me this gaming laptop   :D
20862,"Raft is a great game with a good amount to unlock and explore. Just as I thought my friends and I were reaching the end of the game, new islands and destinations were found. I love the notes left behind and how it alludes to future game play possibilities. The crafting is easy to understand, yet has a decent amount of items to work up to. Playing this with three friends at a LAN party was the best decision. It is a blast competing for barrels and teaming up to keep our raft afloat! If you want something fun, relaxing, and team building, I would suggest this game. The only negative this game had was a glitch about 15 minutes in starting a new world. The game put me out with no raft in the middle of the ocean at night and I had to restart the world, but I have had no problems since!"

20882,Raft is a good game if you like survival.
20883,This is an amazing survival experience if you enjoy being stranded in the ocean. Being one of my favorite go-to survival games take part in constructing a raft any size you want to conquer the ocean. If you haven't gave this amazing title a play-through I highly recommend you give it a try.

I play on the setting where wildlife does not attack since I want a more peaceful experience.  I am not fond of sharks chewing on my rear when i'm scavenging for materials.  lol  Raft is a very colorful game and a lot of fun to play.  I recommend getting the radar set up asap and find all the blueprints to really make your experience more fun.  I'm not going to spoil anything, but make your way through the story in the beginning.  :)  I am looking forward to future expansions now as I have completed the story up to this point and found the main blueprints.  It's really cool how you can build your raft however you want to make it your own.  Now go get the game already! lol"

I play it with a friend, because playing it alone is boring, and once we start, we can't turn it off. We just can't.
It doesn't matter that we've played the game about five times from start to finish. We just can't get enough... even if we'd like the third chapter to come out soon, we can wait because it's worth it.

Edit: The new characters are great, as are all the minor changes in the old chapters, and the third chapter is absolutely amazing. Veruna point is kinda scary, but otherwise it's awesome chapter. We're just sad it's the last one."

Game starts off great, and they promise tons of hype and content and we get a garbage final chapter. wait 1 year for it and i have no desire to complete this buggy glitch crap puzzle filled of a final chapter. temperence is boring and not well made, utopia is a pos, and finally you forgot this entire game was about building rafts not doing lame puzzles on crappy islands you just tossed together,
done with you redbeet, really bothers me your puzzles are so lame and bad i DO NOT WANT TO FINISH THIS GAME I WAITED YEARS FOR"
21009,amazing
21010,"here is what i think about raft and if you should play it. So first it has alot of story and it is cool that it does. second is that it has this shark that constantly follows you around but it tries to kill you, it will bite your raft and destroy it. And still it is a VERY VERY FUN GAME."
21011, fuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuun
21012,A great water survival game! Do not play if you have thalassophobia tho.
21013,"It's way better when playing with friends, since playing alone gets pretty overwhelming, but overall it's really fun. It's refreshingly simple - the only bars you need to watch are food, water, and health - and there's a ton to do and see. After playing for over 10 hours we're still finding new resources and getting excited over new recipes (we just got the monstera recipe!). We're slowly upgrading our raft, locking down our necessities and starting to build luxuries. The home-designer element is pretty optional, but there's a huge variety of stuff to build. I'm told there's an end state somewhere along the line, but we're having so much fun that we're not really worried about it. I think the only thing I could really nitpick is that item placement is sometimes a little funky, and there's no indication in the crafting menu of how BIG something is. This was really only an issue when we built a proper anchor, but it'd be nice to know."

21029,"Alright i""ve played a fair bit of raft and gotten decent progress to big islands and shit all I gotta really say about this game is 
its not for everybody But I did see the appeal eventually of making new weapons I did find the combat abit lacking even with the new enemies you encounter on the ships and big islands it was neat at first but dimmed really fast it was a bit disappointing I thought when I got progressed on this game I'd wanna play it even more but it kinda just felt like sucha  pain in the dick one thing i'd reccomend is making a dipshit eazy mode were u can play creative so its not just cancer repairing and also the food and hunger feature I never really like these kinda meters but it feels like im just always drinking and eating and it reminds me to much of real life and that kinda blows dick so ya 6/10"

21120,"I spent a lot of time in this game and I'm ready to share my opinion with you.
Pros - Very large world and gameplay with many crafts, animals and mechanics. Yes, but is very scarce and few of islands, but what I liked is that there are not ordinary buildings in the middle of the ocean, I do not want to name them so as not to spoil the game for you.
Minusi- There are many bugs with water and animals, but personally it seems to me that the bug with a raft and water is similar to what can happen in real life, a bug with the construction of furniture or a raft times simply did not protect what I was building and just wasted resources and button go in and delete the ""world"" next to each other.
From me- I liked that the authors of the games showed what happens to the ocean when we throw garbage at it."

21157,"Wanted to buy this game for so long with a friend, We finally did and have had a great time already!"
21158,love
21159,Honestly for the price it's a great game. Lazy dev for not updating the chapter because it's a pretty small game. You could spend some time after the story by building a crazy raft and making it look cool but after a few hours of gameplay you get pretty bored and do nothing but wait for a big update with a new chapter. The graphics are great and lots of pc's can run it with out a problem also it's pretty fun to mod the game on a new save game. The support for this is great and makes the game better. 9/10 only missing point is the lazy dev. but a good priced game.

21215,"$20 for essential a waiting simulator. You sit and wait as your boat drifts around and eventually get resources for tools whoch break fairly quickly after you get them. Hunger and thirst seem to drain instantly no matter what I do (Even cooking pot foods don't provide a good buffer). Shark, bear, and lurker enemies seem to have massive range and hit behind them while my spear weapons seem to have absolutely no range at all. Overall boring game and not worth the money in my opinion. Much better games for the price as well, especially in the early access, crafting, survival genre."
21216,"Very fun to play with friends. Even if you never follow the main story, it's really fun just surviving and learning to build new things etc."
21217,Building a raft on your own is a very slow but serene experience. I definitely prefer playing co-op for actual progression in the game. It's a neat way to pass the time and I look forward to seeing more story!
21218,"I really enjoyed the early stages of raft. Cruising along and slowly building your boat bigger and better with drifting junk that you find along the way. It was great. Building better and better navigation to find bigger islands and then getting little pieces of story peppered in. *chef's kiss*

What I didn't enjoy about Raft was the almost clockwork attacks from a shark that would bite on your raft, and seagulls that try to take your crops. The shark aggressively blasting past a neat mechanic to keep you from swimming around too much, by being guaranteed to attack every 5 minutes and completely ruin the serenity of sailing and building.

And what I HATED about Raft, was hitting a story island and having the game go ""THIS AREA IS NOT COMPLETE COME BACK LATER."" Why put that in? Why point out that the game is unfinished in such a horrific way?! As soon as we hit that area, my coop buddy and I stopped playing, because we knew there was no more for us... and now watching the story get slowly updated in dribs and drabs we just can't bring ourselves to run into another one of those. It KILLED the game for us.

Do I recommend Raft? Kinda...once the story is completed. But I wouldn't play it again."
21219,Addictive in the best possible way. Love this game!

21231,"fun not gunna lie, especially with friends"
21232,"Short version:
Yes. If you like survival crafting, this game is a must.

Long version:
For my money, one of the best survival crafting games available. The look and feel, the music, the plot, all of it has this relaxing vibe – not boring, there’s plenty to do – but the chill atmosphere is a break from all the games packed full of jump scares, musical flourishes, loud bangs, and hordes of gnashing teeth. Now, granted, Bruce the shark wants to eat you, but keeping him from chewing on the boat and dealing with him in the water is fairly straightforward. The magic in this title is the sense of advancement and accomplishment as you find and research new items, build your way up the tech tree, and craft gear. Putting it all on a boat means you can choose how much space you want to manage (making your boat bigger is easy), but it also means more territory to protect from Bruce.

As you float across the ocean, you’ll manage your workstations and do your crafting. When you spot something on the horizon, you can steer toward it and drop an anchor to explore. Or you can ignore it. You’ll pass by a neverending parade of small islands that offer a handful of goodies, but as the game progresses you’re pointed to new and larger locations with new enemies, new objects to research, and new recipes for gear. As of this writing there are half a dozen major stops that will require you to be fully outfitted and prepared for extended exploration. The story is interesting but nothing amazing – enough to keep you moving forward – and multiplayer allows you to share your chill adventure with a buddy, although you can solo all the content if you choose to.

Fun, mostly chill, and friend-friendly, a great title for a lazy weekend and a bottle of wine.

21239,"THIS IS A FUN GAME! Raft is a crafting survival game at heart but unlike a lot of these games it's easy to pick up and always feels very rewarding to upgrade your raft with the new items you'll constantly find. You'll start off small scavenging the oceans for scrap with a hook on a rope but soon your raft will grow into a giant mobile home on the water with 6 engines and three floors. Upgrading your raft gives you the expanded ability to sail against the wind and find different locations on dry land that were previously inaccessible. The sense of reward and excitement is tangible when you discover a new outpost or massive island that appears in the far distant mist slowly getting bigger and bigger as you sail towards. Each area contains hints in the form of pages of notes that provide clues and coordinates to the next location. Raft successfully spices up the crafting formula by placing base components underwater and on varied landscapes with huge mountain tops and deep forests to explore. Some of the level design was genuinely smart requiring platforming prowess and in many cases vertical thinking to find the exit with just the right amount of difficulty. I played most of the game co-op with my son which worked perfectly and really gave us some awesome memories. We had a great time exploring the various islands and preparing for the next location by crafting new weapons, fishing to store food, and boiling water. By the end of the Early Access content we were pros at prep and exploration. The survival mechanics are not overly needy like a lot of these games tend to be and I felt playing on the normal difficulty was fine. The Game play arc is very intuitive and rewards the player constantly. You always keep searching for that next item that will let you upgrade and find the next island. I found it similar to the Subnautica formula but even more accessible. However I do have a few criticisms. You'll kill the shark about 100 times by the end.  After the first few hours the constant need to rebuild the raft because he takes a bite out of it every 10 minutes gets old. The graphics are also overly simplistic so don't expect cyberpunk level visuals. The game was fantastic fun right up until the moment the story content ends which felt like it was way too soon. I understand it's early access but the game has been there for a few years now and we're just seeing cosmetic updates to crafting. You can definitely get lost in the building aspect but that will only satisfy for so long. The potential for greatness is here but there needs to be more meaningful story driven content with new islands and locations soon. Hoping the Dev's don't let this game die in early access because it really is a lot of fun and definitely worth your time. I'll definitely be back when they finish it!"

21274,"Overall a great game, the content available currently is genuinely interesting and it is quite fun to just mess around with friends and design a raft. 

However,
after 4 years, it seems *very* little of the game has been touched. We had a hotfix as well as some new items added, but with all the delays, and little to no information about chapter 3, my friends and I have lost a bit of hope. I am not a developer, or anything even close, so I cannot speak from a POV from anyone other than someone that has been waiting and excited. At the very best we can just hope Chapter 3 is a MASSIVE update that was worth the wait, however I am not holding my breathe.

While I do certainly recommend the game, please be aware that at this time, within a couple hours you will be at a standstill. We are unsure when more content will come."

21290,"I've been playing and loving Raft ever since the first chapter. It's one of those early access games that are enjoyable and worth the buy - regular updates, interactive and responsive discord, soothing yet thrilling adventures at sea with a twist of challenges and there's always something new to look forward to with each update. Multiplayer is hilarious chaos, solo is wonderfully immersive, and the story line is entertaining. The music is incredibly relaxing which makes for great little jumpscares."

21293,i like the game
21294,Its ok not the best overrated as fuk but its not bad
21295,"Very fun wish i had friends to play this with though :(
"
21296,Funny and entertaining
21297,fun  multiplayer
21298,I really like this game :D  8/10 because not finished yet.  waiting for chapter 3 to come out :)
21299,there is no dog to pet
21300,it is so fun to just grind i vibe with the good music to its not to hared or stressful i reel recumind the game for new steam users
21301,good
21302,"Fun to kill shark
"
21303,nuts
21304,Its very good. I play with a friend and we enjoy it both. I like the shark we also named it Karen. I like the gameplay and its very adventurers. We have big ship with 5 engines. Pretty bad im saying hahaha. Took us a long but we made the adventure. We are never going to finish the game its fun exploring big and small islands on the way.
21305,good concept poor execution
21306,"good game, very rafty"
21307,amazing and beautiful
21308,good
21309,shark
21310,we love jörg.
21311,"I highly recommend this game. I’m absolutely terrible at it but it is still so fun, especially when playing it with friends. I’ve had hours of laughter and it’s brought my friends and I together after we had moved away."
21312,11/10 :)
21313,"Having a blast so far. It can get a little stressful at first managing food and water, especially with multiple people but once you get over that hump, exploring islands and underwater gets tons easier. Can't wait to keep playing more!"
21314,Very fun and cool
21315,The best game
21316,good game
21317,it is cool
21318,Shark go nom.
21319,Fun with the homies
21320,"water good, splash splash"
21321,It a good game!
21322,"Good and relaxing game, but after finishing what exists for plot there's nothing compelling to keep you playing. I would love to see a Chapter 3 get released finally and maybe some new world interactions to increase the playability beyond just the regular story line. I would like to recommend the game because what it does, it does well- I don't recommend it because I feel that a 4 year development is really dragging on for the amount of content available. I understand that it is only a $20 dollar game but it has so much potential that I think hasn't been fully tapped into."
21323,Shark is big
21324,"This game is really big and very fun, you can explore a lot of islands and I find that extremely cool!"
21325,Just a chill game to relax and craft on!
21326,raft
21327,shark eat big floatie
21328,Great game to play with mates! Looking forward to the next expansion!
21329,"Solved world hunger!!!!!!!!!!
Honestly never knew you could go to sleep and be fully hydrated and fed afterwards. Africa rejoice! And you know what... Mr Beast would be proud of the amount of garbage I picked up. You basically clean up trash and put it in a Amazon box. F** the shark with a weird fetish for corners. The do have a few graphical glitches but all is forgiven because you can point, makes the game Hella FUN! 10/10 IGN 10/10 TEAMSEAS 10/10 Lily!"
21330,"Raft is a fun game to play with friends, I got it for me and an online friend so we had another game to play in off-time. I also sometimes play single-player for fun sometimes so I can understand the game more, but anyway. If you want to play something when you're bored, Raft is a good way to go. (P.S. totally name your sharks, it makes it more entertaining!)"
21331,fun
21332,very easy to be stupid
21333,good game
21334,BEST GAME EVER.....
21335,"Very enjoyable game.

I didn't expect it to be this good.

Really loving it so far. Building my raft and exploring the islands is a lot of fun."
21336,Mmmm Garbage in the ocean
21337,If you like Rust or Minecraft this is kind of a mix between the two. You start off small but end up as big as you like.
21338,s
21339,"Funny storyline, scary monsters, realistic food and drink audio and video."
21340,very fun to play with family
21341,Fun story based multiplayer game with has a decent price
21342,Shark
21343,fun :)
21344,"Very fun and interesting storyline, much more fun to play with friends."
21345,nice

[h1]I really dig the game concept of Raft. Chillin' on a raft in the middle of the ocean with different locations to visit. The content of the game is decent but could be more. After exploring all the necessary locations for the story it got boring. I would also suggest to bring one or two friends along your journey to spice things up.   [/h1]"
21348,uhh... theres a shark! @play this game! #its really fun!

21359,the game is helping other to improve their imagination
21360,"Every update a friend of mine and i are hopping on the game again even if it is a small update like the animal update or big islands update before chapter one. we just start a new world and just play it untill there is no more content left. even when we finish, we gear our self up and just have fun. The Next update is going to be an insane time again!(Chapter 3) it would be so fun again because the last one we already played 3 times to 100%. I just want to start a new raft, chill and have fun playing again with a new update, just like ,,the old days''"

21368,"Nice game play. Little bit routine sometimes, but really fun to play with friends"
21369,Great game to play with friends. Be prepared to wait for content updates though.
21370,This game is essentially the can from Half-Life 2. Pick it up and put it in the trash where it belongs.
21371,i Agree

21377,difficult at first but great when you get the hang of things. great fun with a couple of friends and makes it a bit easier
21378,good
21379,"If you've never gone fishing in IRL, grab a cold one and pop this baby in with some close buds and budlights (or whatever you fancy drinking). This does the job pretty well... the shark acts like a fish on a hook when fishing IRL. When that sucker bites, you're gonna have to put down that beer and run over to fight that damn fish. Thats fishing."

21401,9/10 the game is great but the shark attacking the raft constantly gets a bit annoying.
21402,its just really fun
21403,cool
21404,Who wanna play im tryna play again
21405,I want to play in the shower
21406,"This game will give you motion sickness, but only if you play whilst driving. 
Just crashed my car, ran a red light lol.
Anyone know where fixes Steam Decks, hmu.
 I literally can't take my eyes off it. Addictive, like crack
 MUST install.... *(if you're not the driver)*"
21407,"Solid Basebuilding/exploration game.  Breezy soundtrack and vibrant graphics keep you interested and progression is fun, easy to understand and deep.  Crafting is decent and building you raft is completely open ended.  Great replay-ability to see how crazy you can make your raft.  The story is interesting and can be quite challenging if you aren't prepared."
21408,Good game
21409,"game is boring
"
21410,Pretty good. Was fun playing together with a friend.
21411,
21412,sex on beach
21413,"The survival meters drain too quickly and with all the constant minimalistic resource gathering you have to do it just gets anxiety inducing. It's the kind of survival game where your gear is always deteriorating so you have to constantly gather more resources to make up for the ones lost and over time it just gets tiring as progress feels slow.

Also, when you want sand you have to find specific deposits around islands but you can't just heave a bunch into your bucket from the literal beach you're standing on. And in order to craft a furnace you need 7 bricks, 1 to research and 6 to craft, each requires 2 sand and 2 clay, so that means 14 sand and 14 clay that you have to find in small deposits around an island while having to fish a bunch of fish to craft shark bait to keep it off your back.

And that right there is why I decided to stop playing. This recipe is bullcrap. The design logic behind the resource gathering is bullcrap. The amount of resources you need to gather (especially the fish for shark bait to keep it off you while try to desperately find these sand and clay deposits around an island) is bullcrap.

And so before I can advance any further in the game I have to suffer through absolute bullcrap. And you know what? I'm not gonna. Cause it's bullcrap. 

Horrible design.

If by magic a dev where to read this review: Make any sand and clay (land, dirt) gatherable, not just specific deposits around the water around the island."
21414,good soup
21415,its a very very fun game a recommend this game too people who like survival multyplayer story line games but i have been jump scared by the rats on the yacht but still over all a very good game

21451,"This is pretty much Stranded Deep but not as good. It is extremely grindy as a solo game. Haven't played with friends, so I can't vouch for that. A lot of the mechanics and build requirements make no sense. Somehow you can build a clock with random floating debris? The controls are hella clunky too. Nevertheless, I do get some enjoyment out of it, primarily since it is like Stranded Deep (which I enjoyed). Building your raft is fun, but it takes forever to get the materials to make it into something nice. I am about ten hours into the game and pretty much nothing has happened... I recommend this only because it is like Stranded Deep, but it needs a lot of work..."
21452,"Loved the new additions to the game in recent updates, and building rafts with my friends is crazy fun, 10/10 would recommend (especially for multiplayer)"

8/10"
21462,It's aight
21463,"Fun with friends, fun by yourself, what more?

Raft is that type of game that stays in your mind before you sleep.  Makes you wanna wake up early to play and sends you on an adventure right away.  The amount of content you can milk from Raft is up to how imaginative you are.  If you aren't that type of person to build a lot, fine, there's still a decent story that's still being progressed.  As with all building Open World Survival Craft Games, that sense of personal progression is there.  

Multiplayer mode just enhances it with friends helping you, funny moments you can experience with every interaction.

If you didn't already buy Raft, or aren't able to, figure out a way.  Theres always something you can do to solve your problems.

If you didn't get anything else from this review, at least know my thought.

Overwhelmingly Positive."

21477,yes. RAFT
21478,"Tired of buggy betas, hectic shooter/MMO/wildlife-whatever games that just make you sweat and stumble from one glitch into the next? Look no further. Raft is the game for you. It's chill, it runs well and has an actually intriguing story (although that last part takes a bit to realize). The visuals, although granted not to everyone's taste, are fitting perfectly. It's just fun to play. My recommendation: Try it out and don't rush it, take your time and explore."

21548,"Bought this game early COVID to play with my best friend as we didn't have anyway of hanging out in person due to restrictions. I played a lot of the game but felt as if I wasn't really getting anywhere after over 50 hours of game play. It could be that I didn't really put too much into progressing in a quick enough time span though. I ended up dropping the game because my friends didn't want to play it anymore for that lack of progress and never went back. That being said, if you're one to focus on technology quickly instead of survival (the sharks get unbelievably annoying after a while and if you're not constantly looking for or getting food, it's not ideal to play alone), you might have done a lot better than we did. I'm sure late game play would have been a lot better as long as you've got others to play with. I'd recommend it for those willing to get far quickly before things get too tedious and with friends to keep things interesting."

I'm always eager to play and waiting for the new chapters. If I get asked what game I wanted to play I always put raft in my top spot!"

21561,Saw Noahj456 play it once on stream and I got hooked after I played it for about 6 hrs on the first day. It has some issues but the survival aspect and the crafting is very addictive. I have not progressed far in the story because I've been gathering resources and trying to squeeze all that I can get from each location. 10/10 would recommend.
21562,way more fun the mincraft and rolblox no lie. just wish there was PVP
21563,Super fun with friends
21564,"A great game! There is a lot to explore, always something new to do to survive or progress in the story-it keeps you busy. It is much easier and more fun to play multiplayer than by yourself. Had a small glitch with painting to personalize the raft sometimes but with a restart it was always fixed. Great survival game. Would recommend to others to play in a group!"

21574,"Worth buying.
Can be played casually as a solo player or with friends.
Friends can simply join you on worlds you were playing as a solo player.

Difficulty: Can be played casually creative, casual PvE or go a little bit into more tough stuff.

The Devs seem to care a lot about community input which can be rare to find.
They are active in taking feedback. I back the Developers of this game. 
Trust me, if they did me dirty I'd be singing a different tune."

21617,Great game. Love all the mechanics but it can be hectic at times to try to balance progress in the game with basic survival.
21618,"IF you want to hear your friends bitch about being hungry and thirsty for hours on end, buy this game.
Worth the $20 my friend spent on this game for me."
21619,"This game is good but it takes sooo long to progress. 
The thirst and hunger bars deplete really fast and it feels as if most of your time is spent on getting freshwater and food. And because they deplete so fast, you need to be constantly collecting wood so that gets used up ridiculously fast as well.  
It gets annoying just doing that over and over and over. 
After a certain point, I just stopped playing because it got too tedious."

21663,"The graphics and aesthetic are bright, colorful, and simply gorgeous!  The game play can be relaxing at times, and tense at others!  When I really want to unwind and relax, I like to play in peaceful mode.  When I want more of a challenge, I'll play in the other modes.  For replay-ability, it's similar to Minecraft.  Once you know all the story beats, the gameplay becomes more about designing and building bigger, better, or more creative rafts.  (Creative mode is great for planning out your raft, so you don't waste time/resources.)  The only thing I don't like about this game is the frequency of shark attacks and re-spawns.  (Yeah, I know there are ways to avoid them...but I still wish I had more time.)  In short, I absolutely love this game, and I'm very excited for the release of chapter 3!!"

21665,"Get a friend to play this game with you, its much more enjoyable! :)"
21666,"If you are looking for a relaxing experience to do with friends, this game is great for that. There are moments of tension, but for the most part, Raft is a game where you spend the majority of your time farming for materials, upgrading and building your raft, and occasionally fighting a shark.

In some ways, the game does appear unfinished, with the story sharply cutting off at a certain point. However, the developers are great about continuing to update the game, and keeping its playerbase up to date about upcoming additions."

Absolutely fantastic game for crafting, gathering, building, sandbox, farming and animal simulation, exploration, casual, relaxing, and an interesting story that is done pretty well (though could be expanded upon)."

21714,"We were trying to find a new multiplayer game that was casual, and thought about this… decided to buy it… and we’ve played it for 2 straight days 😂

One of the biggest things that bothered me at the start about this game actually turned out to be its biggest credit, which is the complete lack of a tutorial . Why? Well, it dumps you in the middle of the sea on a raft and you need to figure absolutely everything out for yourself , which has probably accounted for at least 8 hours of gameplay alone!

If it had been hand holding it actually would have lost most of its charm!

There’s nothing I can fault about it. It’s now my top casual multiplayer game 👍"

21730,"Simple game with an entertaining loop and large story worlds. Fun with friends and decent playtime and adventuring. 

Some features (E.G. titanium ore, fuel pipes, etc. aren't quite fleshed out and some mechanics feel a bit jank, but you don't really have to look up too much. the game is actually pretty intuitive but is just missing some features. Development is sort of slow.


6/10"
21731,nice game
21732,awesome
21733,Good
21734,GG
21735,"it was amazing
"
21736,"TL;DR - Interesting the first few hours but gets really repetitive and boring after even if you follow the story. Enemies are real damage sponges, but 'gib you really quickly.

The nice plus is you can play this game with others even if they have high latency connections. Gameplay is mainly collecting resources to modify your raft to follow the path for the story.

On the side you get to visit a few islands and are constantly eating shark meat as the shark shows up non-stop throughout the game, which is a worry at first, but then a nuisance and waste of time later on.

Combat is messed up as besides the enemies being damage sponges, they have broken pathing mechanics and will detect you from way too far away, or magically warp/teleport to hit you even if you try to grab cover. The enemies are a worry at first when you just have a pointy stick, but after you get iron spears and rock arrows it's pretty much can you kill them without them glitching out.

Food and water become a non-issue later on, especially after you have several chests full of shark meat and multiple water evaporators. The hunger and thirst mechanics though are really annoying and probably need a tweak to how often you need to manage it as it just starts to get really tedious as you get further into the story and artificially inflates the difficulty.

There's a good amount of non-story raft customization, you can change colors, add furniture, and there are wall and floor parts to design buildings. There is no automation outside of the collection of flotsam by nets on your raft that pick up items in your line of travel.

While it may be completely playable, there's just too much that makes this game more of a hassle than an enjoyment to play, even with friends, which is why I am not giving this game a recommendation."

It's a good game, it really is. It's enjoyable.
But the lack of actual features and glitches makes it extremely hard to enjoy for long periods.
There is a very linear path in the game, it will be the same almost every time you play. The waves make it impossible to grab items at times they go straight through the hook. The waves frequently look extremely buggy and islands feel like they are extremely lacking. 
The story is decent but doesn't drag me in at all, and for sure wasn't worth $20
For 4 years of progress on steam, It doesn't really show."
21752,this game is amazing and is great to play with friends!
21753,"At first the game can seem a little slow in progress, however once you get to a certain point within it, a story will occur and definitely convinces you to play it more."
21754,loads of fun
21755,"such a fun game to play with friends. alone it's nice to grind for a little bit and figure stuff out, but the game really shines when you have people to do with it. exploring all the islands, figuring out how to advance, it's just all so fun. i probably like it a lot more than other people but seriously, this is the most fun i've had playing a game in a while."

21768,"What can i say about this game other than it is like no other game out there. I would recommend this game for anyone who likes survival games, but wants a change of scenery from the land based survival  like ""The Forest"". If you are unsure you would like it, just download it already!

(Also you do need pretty decent specs, as i found out when i originally downloaded the game on my 6 year old laptop, which by the way, ran on 2GB of RAM)

I remember the good old days when there was no chapter 1, story line or lore, and you would just float across the ocean on your collection of driftwood you would call your ""Home"". Chapter 1 was a welcoming sight, and i remember freaking out when mama bear would attack me for no reason. Chapter 2 was incredibly fun, especially launching the toy rocket (unfortunately i couldn't find explosive powder and had to result to the wiki to find it).

Honestly this game is just insane. If you haven't already downloaded this game, do it now. And worst comes to worst, you can always ask steam for a refund."
21769,"LOVE LOVE LOVE this game! So much stuff to do and build, different difficulty levels, co-op fun, etc. It has some flaws, as most games do, but it is well worth the full asking price in my opinion."

21781,"In my opinion, this game is only fun with friends. The game get's pretty boring at some points but having friends makes it better. There are a few problems though. At least in my experiences, the hit boxes in this game are absolute garbage. Sometimes it's impossible to pick stuff up even if my inventory is completely empty. Hitting some enemies dead in the head does no damage at all and your attacks just phase through. The story in my opinion is sort of a joke and kind of bland. The building in the game isn't as polished as it could be and a bunch of things just don't line up. Although that game is VERY far from perfect. It's still a ton of fun with friends. 7.25/10"

21797,very fun
21798,"This game is fun, exciting, and there's lots to do and explore. I can feel the waves call out to me as I sing along to the Moana soundtrack. The graphics and art style are gorgeous. Would totally recommend for people who like survival adventure games!"
21799,its a good game its just that it takes SOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO long to progress
21800,Raft has me hooked. no pun intended. i'm surprised this is early access
21801,"playing this game with a friend is fantastic. There is always something to do, and ideas to plan. Its the perfect bonding game. There is an amazing feeling in progressing; as your raft gets bigger and more complex."
21802,"amazing game, me and 4 others played for 12 hours straight without realizing how long it has been. super fun and worth it, exited for chapter 3!!!!!"

21833,"I do really like this game, its much better with people- especially funny people.

playing alone is great if you got time to kill and dont mind grinding a bit to get all the things you need. im not the smartest cookie :') so it took me like twice as long to get simple things but hey if i can do it then im sure anyone can. 

its a great game to stream, i got the most viewers playing this or minecraft so if you are a streamer and like this game then do play it! i ended up letting my viewers join and it was a lot of fun.

sf\ very good gamw"
21846,great game if you enjoy getting lost at sea!
21847,"WARNING: Avoid this game if you suffer from severe motion sickness.
Reason for Edit: Game has fully released.

A chill exploration game. While starting out can be a bit challenging, when you have sufficient resource to shark-proof your boat, it becomes a very chill game. Nice sound tracks too. However, expect to do some pakour/jump quest towards the end of the game. 

Pros:
 + Good soundtracks
 + Chill game play, good to de-stress with
 + Good for both solo & coop
 + Overall good/acceptable voice acting

Cons:
 - Building in this game can be a bit of a pain compared to other craft/survival games due to the way block detection/connection works. 
 - The waves/water physics in the game cost me alot of building mistakes.
 - Some occasional performance issues"
21848,"As more story content is created, the game becomes more and more interesting. The puzzles are fun in peaceful mode. The difficulty of Raft is in the Hard setting... Sharks man.
SHARKS!!! The sharks will ruin your day and make you rage so hard. Fun game so far, and generally enjoyable for the amount of playtime there is available so far in March 2022. I recommend playing this game, it is pretty fun."
21849,Very fun! It's like Minecraft but more fun. It's worth the money!!! :)
21850,nice

21858,hard but  fun
21859,"Play with friends, this is amazing. Maybe change your resolution if it's lagging, but the visuals are beautiful, the gameplay is extremely fun and the difficulty is perfect for a casual multiplayer survival."
21860,"Great game, really immersive fun. Not for everyone, I would say. 
Building from the ground up is what makes it truly great, though. It's a fantastic sense of adventure and scraping everything together as you go. 
I love all the content and how wide the world seems, while still being manageable. Can't wait for more."
21861,its kinda fun :/

21891,game
21892,it a good gane
21893,"this game is actually faairly accurate. i lived through the horrors of being lost at sea. i was on a cruise once with my parents and i accidentally sliopped on some ice and peeled there skin off, exposing the skinwalkers that lie beneath the beautiful faces of my once family. after that i was a bit paranoid. a small child walked up to me and asked me if i was ok, then recited my full name and birthdate, as his eyes became matterless voids containing nothing but the emptiness of space. i grabbed my 9mm and shot him in the eye while screaming ""عيون الفراغ تدعوني."" i pulled out what was left of his brain and shoved it into the engine of the boat, which kiiiinda started a chain reactiom which led to the boat sinking. the captain was screaming at me the wholetime but all i could focus on was the ants crawling under his skin. i grabbed my giant bowie knife and skinned him alive while he shrieked a deafening scream, which was the sound of a million souls being freed from the chains that bind them. fornttieet gOd OUT!!!11!!!"
21894,"I is amazing how well it is made. I was expecting a much more boing game but I was wrong. This is the game for you if you like minecraft, story lines, and subnautica."

21932,"This game is the potatoes without the meat. Games like this are the main reason why I stay away from Indie games. Raft is a good idea that dies off extremely fast. As a result, the game isn't worth the price of admission. If you can't get this at a discount, put your cash elsewhere. You can finish the game in about 2 hours, and after that, there are boring biomes or creative mode to create a boat to sail to various islands. Building a Raft can be fun; however, that dies off quickly due to the islands being about as dull as Joe Bidens STOU. Combat is something left to be desired. You get a boring spear and bow to fight against bland enemies. The enemies are only 7 in total and uninspiring. It's a complete yawnfest. The last story island was a real disappointment. You have this awesome-looking city and inside of it is a complete and utter borefest waiting for you. It's lifeless, quiet, and dead. What's the point in putting effort into something if all your going to do is get through it and leave? In all, Raft seems rushed, unfinished, and more could have been put into it. If you are thinking about buying this, don't. Save your money and purchase gas instead."
21933,"Good game and enjoyable in a aspect on not actually having to do the story mode (even though I did), only conserns is that the game is super short, completed it in 8 hours (No previous experience with the game), would love to see more especially in the ending as its just a bit tedious and not really enjoyable at the end, but a great CO-OP survival game."
21934,I really like most of the game but the part I hated the most was the way death works and the shark because the only when you die you cannot get you items back unless you are playing online and it is a main part of the game to go underwater and get resources but then the shark comes and kills you the only way to avoid this is to kill the shark which takes a while or make shark bait and that also takes time because you have to get specific fish otherwise this game is fun and I really like it
21935,Very nice game. Extremely interested in the story line and look forward to seeing what happens next!
21936,Very Noce
21937,"It's a fun, simple game. but its also very challenging."
21938,This game is amazing! Exploring the ocean and finding huge islands is a lot of fun and I fine myself playing for hours at a time. This game is really grindy with resources but once you get the item you wanted it makes it all worth it. I've had a blast with this game and I recommend it to all.

The story is amazing and is very deep. its not a game you would complete once and never play again. As there is so much more you can do after completion. The updates are always huge. I definitely would recommend

21986,An extremely fun and original twist on the survival genre. Great for the co-op players!
21987,"this game is short, but sweet. and even when you run out of chapters, you can just play it like an endless survival. you can also go to story islands after you beat them.

in short: you should definitely play. I've played over 24 hours and i never felt bored. not for a second.
truly, a work of art"
21988,REALLY GOOD
21989,yes.
21990,FUN:)
21991,"raft is a really good game i love it and they should maybe add more pets, I love it!"
21992,Yes
21993,"For some time I have owned this game, played it off an on since I bought it. but with the addition of a story mode a bit ago, I have gotten a lot more interested. I recently took another look into the game. I even got into it playing with my wife. I am not one to play MP games as well.
now lets get into the depth of this game.
what are the pros and cons of this game.

Cons. 
1: No character customization. ( for now )
2. Building system and the need for a post every 2 blocks.
3. Repeated islands. ( i know they working on new islands )
4. Islands with obvious missing decoration ( not sure if being worked on or not )
5. Hunger/thirst system degrade to fast
6. Tools degrade to fast
7. Animals clipping thru landmass/building. ( common issue with most video games )
8. When you kill boars or most any animals except sea creature's ( shark ), they can ragdoll underground or shoot off into space. and keep ragdolling even when sitting still. which causes issues with trying to harvest them when they don't shoot off half a mile away or under the map. i lose half my boar kills due to them disappearing underground or shooting off half a mile away. this is my biggest issue with the game atm.
9. Lose everything on death, with no option to try and recover your items.

Pros.

1. its a building game. I love building games.
2. go at your own pace. no need to rush the story line.
3. I love survival games, this defiantly scratches that itch.
4. haphazard painting system really fits in with building with what you got feel.
5. many different start difficulty options
6. the kill system, which is frustrating and rather funny at the same time.
7. a rare time I will say this is fun with friends.

over all I do really enjoy the game. I have only crashed once since as of this post. while my wife has crashed several times, but that's mostly due to her laptop being 11 years old.
game is good on lower spec computers and laptops as well.
I normally play on easy setting after doing a lot on normal setting. but I hate losing all my stuff when I die. so on easy. I still get the survival mode with chance of death, but I don't lose what's in my inventory. I recommend this mode if you don't want to deal with losing your inventory each time you die.

a side part, achievement's.
normally I do not actively go after achievement's. I just play the game and if I get them, then I get them. this time, as I play with my wife, we both work to get them. which makes it rather fun."
21994,fun
21995,"I have 140 hrs on record. My laptop is the crappiest thing out there as of 3/8/22. Even if you have a Laptop from 2011 that refuses to accept windows updates until 9 tries (like me) this game is playable.

Sometimes I lag and struggle with the game randomly closing without warning like if I move too fast however most builder games like this that I enjoy are 100% worse. I adore builder, strategy, survival games like raft. The issue is finding one that runs halfway decent. I do wish there were more outfits for characters and a choice for lower settings for crappy lappy users though I will always recommend Raft as a more aesthetically pleasing game on Steam with a risk. I love the storyline My favorite chapter is Carvan Island I do wish their was more information on the notes with the zipline hooks though... There is one talking about never forgive us for what we've done above a zipline and I'd love to know what they did.. but I'm sure as development continues something might lead back to it."
21996,good
21997,"I just don't think it's fun, this is a game that you need to study to play to understand various recipes, I like my games to introduce intricacies later on, so that way when I already like the game fundamentally the complexities of various features don't piss me off. I'm sure a lot of people like games like that, I'm not one of them"
21998,"The game can be a bit laggy at times, other that, it's amazing!"
21999,Amazing game

22005,"well i got 511 hours as i write this so i'd say i like it. Its a great builder and mild survival game. 

the rafts you can make are glorious from small to large from tall to short. I spend hours just trying a new design theme. mm how tall can i build? yeah physics are not really a total thing here. the collecting of materials is satisfying the combat is not significant and once you know the patterns fairly easy (don't play hard is all i'm saying). I play mainly easy and relaxed (relaxed if you don't want to fight the beasts) if i want to tour the islands. normal if i want to pull my hair out fighting sharks, bears, boars and birds, dame you birds (i don't like the birds but hay nothings perfect). hard is well silly really i mean 2 sharks means loss of raft parts....as they both attack the raft at the same time what part will you save??? lol 

there is a mod community as well. 

oh did i say the devs are active and adding more content on a regular basis. 

great building fun with small challenges and islands to explore for riches, ok materials. 

Best $22 i spent on a game in a while. highly recommended. 

Ok for some help to people having trouble.
-don't play on hard unless you have friends even normal is iffy alone easy is more fun imo. 
-focus on gathering mats at first stay out of the water at first too. 
- make spear first, then hammer, then cup and the entry water maker and food cooker. make sure you dont put the first few items down on a corner base part as thats the highest  place sharks come to chomp on. why you make the spear first. 
-make 6-9 raft basses min to start, this gives you some eating room for the shark. and helps keep your items away form the shark as best as possible. 
-by now you should be getting close to or seeing small islands, next make a paddle so you and jam the raft against the island and let the current keep it there. this is until you have a sail and you can do that with the sail. don't bother with anchors yet. but make sure your raft is stable before you leave it. 
- so far the food you get out of the crates etc should be enough and the first fruits you get from the first islands will top you up health and drink wise. 
- don't bother with the shark bait, one shark is easy to kill. trick is to watch it coming at you and backing away from it poke it with the spear just as it opens its mouth, then as it passes poke it again. wait for it to return and repeat until dead. this will give you a shark head (save all animal heads for later making bio fuel). this is the easiest way to deal with the shark and get meat ( 4 per shark). i find if you kill the sharks your almost self suficent for food. 
- once shark is dead harvest everything you can underwater before the shark re-spawns, you want to focus on iron ore, copper ore, clay and sand ( very important to get the smelter as soon as you can) and a few rocks for axes. then seaweed(?) and the other items underwater. above water take all wood, food and items from crates, leave the floweres until much later when you have the storage space. 
-you may need a couple small storage boxes now. 
keep collecting items until you have enough to make the smelters assuming you've made the table for reasurching, note researching uses the item. 
once you get a smelter, melt iron ore and make nails. these will allow you to re-enforce your raft base parts to keep the shark from chomping it. this is a little time consuming but once done the shark wont attack your raft anymore. 
melt sand next for the larger water maker this will make 5 cups at a time and wont eat up wood. this will do you until closer to end game for water production
food can be grown too one small flower box will grow three potatoes or three radishes. these produce 6 edible or growable items. so you always get three to eat and three to grow the next batch. note  sea gulls will attack them so keep an eye on them until later. also note if your grow box is inside a building the seagulls wont bother it. 
well by now your on your way and can become self sufficient very easily and wont really have to worry about food or water again later you'll have better cooking methods to make even more food and water. 

enjoy.

22016,kapan update bang?
22017,"Very hard game to start by yourself.  Watch a bunch of starting videos on YouTube.  Even though SOD2 rules Reddit, the RAFT! category is highly watched.  Most questions I had have been answered in under an hour, and the longest was 8 hours because my question was so generic that people were telling me the wrong way.  Start out on Peaceful mode and not Creative because it is overwhelming on Creative.  If you want to play with me, send me a friend request.  At this point, I'm just 24 hours ahead of you (minus a trail version that I played 3 years ago)."

22037,fun to play with friends and just fun game to play by yourslef
22038,It was cool
22039,"The game as it currently is - is pretty enjoyable. I have been able to sink a good chunk of hours in and enjoy my time however I definitely think that this game is a little more enjoyable with people to play with. Playing solo is doable for sure but managing a larger raft by yourself can be a little painful. Creatively - this does allow you to build some pretty cool rafts - honestly the game discord has folks showing off their builds and they are all pretty impressive. The only thing that I think is a shame is the bigger your raft gets - the more laggy your game will be. Story line can be pretty quick (I know they are adding chapter 3) but overall good. 

Achievement hunters - I would definitely recommend going through the story line once and enjoying the game/learn what to do prior to hunting. You will earn almost all of them by doing so. After you are done your play through and start the ""grind"" the only knowledge I can share is that hooking any kind of items will count towards it. That includes items your raft mates might not want and have since thrown in the water. Hook everything and anything. The only other ""grind"" is hunting the screecher, which... you will figure out for yourself. Enjoy the game in the meantime!"
22040,"raft is love raft is life, even better with friends"

22058,"If you like building things, or just playing games that allow you to level up gear/housing, I highly recommend this game. You can play alone or with friends, and that teamwork allows for really great interaction. I really love this game."
22059,"Really like the raft, I've put a lot of hours into this and the main reason I rate it so much is because its very relaxing. If you've had a stressful day and want to play something chill to wind down, this is the game to play. The only thing i would say is that i wish there was a few more elements added to it - like more to do on islands, more furniture to unlock and more variations, more characters - or even better make your own character would be good! That said there is always room for more things to be added overtime and I know that this game still gets an update every now and again, so who's to say all those things wont be added eventually. All in all I love this game just purely for the fact that its entertaining and relaxing."
22060,good gam
22061,still not a fan so many bugs still.
22062,"Raft is an awesome game with good graphics, good story and a hilarious game with friends.

You have endless possibilities of building cool rafts and discovering new islands, capture animals, make awesome food and much more!

When you start getting a big raft is where the fun begins, visiting new islands and completing the story which is really fun

Scavenge debris on the water's surface, gather wood and metal from islands, turn your tiny floating platform into a floating home, and try to find some way off the endless blue sea, all while keeping the shark from chewing your boat away.

The soundtrack is breathtaking, the bugs are minimal, the graphics are phenomenal, and the memories in singleplayer and coop will last you a lifetime. This game is simply a ""Must Have"" for any survival game enthusiast. You won't regret giving it a try!"

22103,"I highly recommend this game! I know a lot of people complains about the lack of content but I genuinely don't mind waiting. They are a small team so it's understandable that it takes longer to produce!

On the other hand, I love the fact you can choose between many modes (creative, peaceful, easy, normal, hard). I've so far tried creative, peaceful and normal and really enjoyed each modes! Either solo or with friends, each of these modes are really fun to explore and go through!

I genuinely love the building side of raft, you can do things amazingly pretty, or very impressive (I saw people making actual pirate ships or a giant piano). On my side, I like the more cozy side of building and my majestic toilet on top of my raft so I can sit and watch the sun goes up while having my morning poop LOL

I also love the story part of raft and all the challenges that you find along the way. It has nice puzzle and I genuinely haven't been bored at all of the game! I really love the more laid back play style on peaceful where I don't have to worry that my ass get chomped every 2 seconds LOL It helps me focus more on the building while still being able to have the feeling of survival with the thirst and hunger with the story mode. I don't know, I quite like it a lot! I also get less frustrated since I often play the game after work to relax, not to stress myself out more by worrying about my crops or my raft getting chomped down hahaha although I think I prefer the normal mode when I am with my friends because I feel it's more enjoyable and more engaging that way!!

I'm quite excited for chapter 3! Let see what Redbeet got for us next!!"

22112,"A great game to play with friends! It's also possible to play solo, but I recommend doing it with someone. This game has a great world to explore, with a story to follow. Sadly, that story is pretty short and when you've completed it, there isn't much more to do, than to grind out more materials and prepare for new content, which is very rare. The environement is beautiful with tons of islands to explore. Raft is a pretty laid back survival game, which makes it easier to have fun and really explore the world and crafting system without having to think about food and water every few seconds."

22123,"Raft survival in a nutshell: You have to consume unreasonably massive amounts of food every 10 seconds while having to defend your raft from a shark, reliably following you over the entirety of the planet's oceans, simply respawning 2 minutes after being killed with 30 spear pokes, also keeping an eye out for seagulls trying to steal your crops, all while looting a few islands and rafts here and there if you are able to find some time for undisturbed progression."

You need to have stuff to Research the better stuff, so you work on obtaining, from various areas, different stuff to broaden what you can craft, so you can survive better.  You go in a little blind since you don't have a map of what you need to get the better stuff.  Comes with time in the game.  IMHO."

22208,"I think other people might like the game more, but for me personally, I despise having the health and water timers. I don't mind cooking for buffs, like in Valheim, but having two little shit timers ruining every other bit of the game is annoying as hell. 

Out having fun exploring a tiny island? Oop, didn't cook anything on my shit fire in the last three minutes, better cut FUN short so I can run back to cook shit that doesn't even matter in the game.

""But it's a survival game. You do realize you need food and water to surMRGLGLGLMFSONKIFKFN.""

Don't even bring realism up when discussing this game. You start off on 4 wooden planks that magically have 4 pontoons on the bottom of them as a raft, and along with that, you have a giant trash-made hook on a rope, that you sling out and magically acquire plastic bottles, palm leaves and planks of wood. 

AND, for some reason, even though they're THE PUPPIES OF THE SEA, sharks attack your shitty little pontoon raft every 3 seconds until you get the upgrades later. None of that is realistic, and sharks don't do that.

There is zero reason for the shit timers. You already got a shark eating your shit, you have to bait it away if you want to go under water. Good enough for a timer.

The islands are crap, and it's an exploration game. What, are they worried someone is going to just set up shop in one of the islands and just stay there? WHO CARES? It's an exploration game. People would get bored even in the robot city. There is fuck all to do on those islands, and the ocean (due to your raft) is cooler anyway.

And it's all ruined by an anti-fun timer waiting to slowly murder you if you don't build like 7 grills and just spam cook every other second. And that's on the easy difficulty, which I lowered it to to try to be less annoyed by the food timer.

There is a mode that gets rid of the hunger issues, creative mode, but I still want to gather stuff. I would even still cook just for the hell of it, but there's no point because creative mode gets rid of everything related to gathering and exploration. There are no islands, no resources to gather, basically a bunch of fucking nothing on a flat ocean that doesn't move, but hey. you can build a raft that takes up the entirety of the game. Woo fucking hoo. Open water, no islands, no gathering, no nothing, and you. Whoop-dee-doo.

I am going to see if there's a mod that fixes this, and even then I am leaving this review as-is since that's how the game came.

Not only are there the problems I've mentioned, but there's something else that annoys me specifically about this game, and really it sets the tone for all of these types of games: 

The water purification. You spend all this fucking time cooking water over a fire, and you get a single cup of water. Now keep in mind, this dumb fucking asshole you're playing sits there literally fishing out ENTIRE PLASTIC JUGS all fucking day, but because this game has ""realistic survival mechanics,"" PFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFT, your stupid ass character can't figure out to use the jug for water! It's adding insult to injury.

You could do what they're talking about in warmer weather using plastics only, but that requires only warm sunlight. And they use a cup as a collector because it takes forever for water to evaporate, condense, and then drip into a cup. You only do that if you have no fire, but do have clear plastics (or glass). If you are using fire to boil water, their stupid ass doesn't need a small fucking cup on either end. And you can't make the argument that ""well, that's all they have,"" because you end up making like ten of these fucking contraptions, it's absolutely asinine.

AND STILL not only that, these idiots don't even know how the shit works! They have the unit EXPOSED TO OPEN AIR ON THE OCEAN! Did no one else see the problem with the shit? Air blows away the steam! You would get almost nothing for your efforts, which is exactly what you get. It's the stupidest shit I've ever seen.

And mind you, I would ignore all of this moronic shit if I wasn't on a literal anti-fun timer! And unless you find a cyborg stomach in your travels, while you'll have a huge stack of food at some point (I could do that now, it's just too annoying), you STILL have to do that annoying cooking sometimes and stare at your stupid timers. I've seen later that you get nets that basically collect everything for you, but who cares? I would rather go around collecting shit than stare at a shit timer, and even worse cooking and purification tasks. They're so boring and pointless for a game where you're Minecrafting shit with floating trash to make a raft empire. It's ridiculous.

And another thing; your grill can only cook one thing at a time. What kind of stupid shit is that? It's a damn fire, you don't have to cook a single raw potato on a whole fire! So then you gotta build more of the shit if you don't want to spend 8 days cooking one potato at a time. And again, even if there's an improvement later, unless it's a Gordon Ramsey simulator added into the game, the need to cook and purify water in a boring way for a shit timer STILL ruins the fun of the game.

0/10 because it annoyed me."
22209,it is a awesome open world survival with many things and updates
22210,never updates trash game 🦧🦧🦧

22220,"i really want this game can anyone gift it to me
"
22221,great survival game
22222,"I usually like sharks, but not in this game."
22223,"As a survival crafting game this game delivers on that. My biggest complaint of this game is that there is not much to do. it really encourages you to find main objectives to get more recipes. But afterwards there isn't much to do. Things break super fast so there is always a need to gather materials but then the shark becomes sort of a bother. For the price I think its justified for the amount of stuff it has now but I'll wait for a few more updates before going back into the game. 

Also the giant rock throwing bird can absolutely do one."
22224,It is good fun with friends.
22225,"Very good and fun, has a great story and is amazing with friends. (also available to mod)"

22233,Good game with friends
22234,yummmmmm
22235,Super fun and interactive. It is a little grindy but it is totally worth it. The story is also a well written part!
22236,"I've found Raft to be a mostly calm experience, though I've only played through the campaign on Easy and Normal difficulties. I prefer to try building what I envision as fun projects, but with the world background of the campaign, so I've only dabbled in the sandbox mode a tiny bit. I also prefer the access to certain decorative items like the white & red screecher heads, which rules out playing the campaign on ""friendly"" mode but I like that there's the option to play through the campaign in a way that you don't have to worry about dying to anything but your own stupidity/drowning.
That said, the building system in the game is quite versatile for one that has set rules about which pieces can ""snap"" together, and I've found a lot of fun in the challenge of shaping things just right to have the end cosmetic effect that I'm trying to attain. In my many hundreds of hours logged so far, I've been able to build:
1) a giant floating, ejaculating penis
2) a squid
3) a giant hammerhead shark
4) a car
5) an actual, ""flying"" airplane on stilts
And I've done all of this in the vanilla game, without any mods.

I look forward to future updates, where I'll get to further decorate and modernize my floating homes!"
22237,AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
22238,I love morrowind
22239,I think that raft is a very amazing and adventourus game that i think most people would enjoy. I enjoy it so much that is upsets me that i finished it because i want that adventure that is so great about this game.
22240,good
22241,Fun Game To play with friends
22242,My friend is massive and wont play with me
22243,PLEASE GIVE ME CHAPTER 3 ALREADY
22244,"Very good game, entertaining :)"
22245,it is super fun
22246,this game is good
22247,"I have played this game for almost 30 hours now, and I fucking regret every damn second. I have killed bruce over 80 damn fucking times and its been the same. I honestly question if this is what god meant when he said ""eternal purgatory."" It hass been two years since chapter 2. The ending felt like someone shoved dog shit down my throat and put a sticky note on my forehead with the next coordinates that don't even exist yet. This game was released in 2018, its been almost 4 years, and they haven't released the ending to this game. I do not want to wither away and be 70 years old playing this game, just so I can find out how it fucking ends. I sincerely regret my purchase, and the time I spent playing this dogshit game."
22248,its fun
22249,"im writing this so i can be in a review video, HELLO!
"
22250,"If you are looking at this game and think it's really something you'll enjoy, you probably will. Fun from all sides. Building, surviving and planning. It's a game that captures relaxing and exciting at the same time. The graphics are well thought out and really aid to the feel of the game. You'll pay once to come back and feel like it's a whole new game. The game is epic scale without being overwhelming. If the game continues to develop the way it has this will be on of those titles that ends up in everyone's game library.

22255,This game is a wonderful sandbox game with so many different things to build/discover and a cool story line.
22256,Good Game
22257,this game is really good
22258,FY
22259,uuuuuuuuuhhh
22260,Not worth $20

22263,sick
22264,scawy shak
22265,;.;.;.
22266,Only few types of animals appear in this game
22267,"This is one of those rare games that is right for everyone. Hard mode is intense and challenging. Normal mode has a nice balance of challenging and tranquil. Easy and peaceful mode, with no aggressive AI, manages a great game loop that keeps you immersed and eager to learn more, build better, and travel further.

The devs are always working, improving, and updating. This is a deep game, but can be played in the “shallow end” for as long as you like. My partner’s 5 year old proved that true, building his own raft that resembled a stadium, and fishing to his heart’s content (in peaceful mode).

I would recommend this game to literally anyone."
22268,NICE GAME
22269,Good game I hate seagus i hate them i hate birds now all birds bad so annyoing birds
22270,"I enjoy murdering the shark over and over, wearing his head as a trophy."
22271,It is an okay game
22272,"The game is amazing, no doubt. I just have one question fpr RedBeet - why is it when you kill ''Mudhogs'' you don't get the kill for the achievment ''Expert Warthog Hunter'', even though Mudhog is also relates to the Hog family. What's the point of mudhogs if you kill them you will not be ''closer to the achievment. I hope you can review this and change."
22273,pretty good
22274,"A BIG HELL NO DONT BUY THIS GAME.  the dev team has been working on an update for more than a year and it has made little to no progress moving forward, i expect that by 2024 or 2025 they should have chapter 3 released and buggy as fuck until they fix those bugs a year later. 
IF you want a survival game on the ocean stay the fuck away from raft

22286,this game is amazing!
22287,"If you're like me and wished for a newer version of Sims Castaway without the tiresome bathing and socializing but still has all the food, then this is the game for you. Crafting new objects using found items, resource gathering, building your raft, and even some puzzle solving. While I'm waiting for the third chapter to come out, I've been wondering if a version could be done of this in space. Derelict spacecraft, surviving astronaut, has to gather supplies to fix various problems or make his life better. You could float around and anchor to asteroids, small moons, maybe even another piece of space junk."
22288,"this game is honestly just great and there is something for everyone whether it be story, creation, adventure raft has it all if you have 20 bucks and want to get a new game get raft its a great game and i promise you will have so much fun"

22294,this is a fun game if you really like adventure and survival games.
22295,Zen style survival. compared to many its alot more laid back. ALSO instead of running from base to resources and back. you and your base are mobile. so dont get stranded on an island. Fun. kinda difficult at times.
22296,never gonna give you up
22297,"fun game

22310,The game is fun but it can  be really hard progressing alone.
22311,Compared to stranded deep this game is a lot more developed. the graphics are not insane and the feel of the game is relaxing. if you play minecraft then you will like this game because it feels very similar to minecraft in a lot of things. the only things i don't like about this game is that items only stack to 20 and it takes up a lot of space in small storage chests very quickly. this game could stand to take a page from minecraft and increase the stacks to 64. i also don't like that the wind doesn't change directions at all untill you progress with the story. i want to take my time and do things slowly but can't.
22312,hi
22313,"my go-to looting sim, always <3"
22314,"Update:  The final chapter is finally here!  And WOW does it ever suck.  Aggravating bosses, badly designed puzzles, new stuff to craft that isn't worth crafting, and of course some new bugs.  A disappointing end to one of my favourite games.  


Also, the game is not playable on Steam Deck, despite the rating saying so.  It has performance issues and crashes regularly.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


Raft is the better, wetter Minecraft clone I didn't know I needed.  As the game opens, you're inexplicably stuck in the middle of an ocean on a floating wooden square.  It's a premise that's immediately engaging.  How do you survive?  Where will you go?  What happens when you get there?  And through it all, you're just sailing along, sometimes aimlessly, sometimes with a goal or destination in mind.  And as you travel, the endless junk you collect from the surrounding ocean fuels your journey and feeds your raft, as it grows in both size and complexity.  

This is where the similarities to Minecraft begin, but also end.  It's an endless, randomly-generated world you're sailing in, and the Minecraft interface is put to good use.  But Raft's world isn't a bunch of cubes, it's a beautifully stylish, lonely dystopia.  It's a sort of Cute Fallout, where everything is a ramshackle creation of junk, but also cozy and inviting.  It's a great-looking game.  There are beautiful sunrises and sunsets, and that emotional feeling when a new island appears just off in the distance never gets old.  

It's got its problems, true.  The combat is really lame.  It's about on par with Minecraft: you poke at the enemy and then try to move out of the way.  The enemies are tedious to fight and the hitboxes are a bit off, so it's always hard to tell when you're about to get whacked.  You can use a spear or a bow... and that's pretty much it.  But thankfully, combat isn't really the focus of the game.  

The bigger issue is probably the ridiculous crafting recipes and endless grinding for resources.  But I'd be lying if I said I didn't actually enjoy that.  Items break constantly, and your character is one of the hungriest in gaming.  So you're constantly looking for food to eat, water to drink, and crafting and re-crafting the same tools, weapons and gear over and over again.  

The recipes make little sense:  it takes tons of plastic bottles to make one functional plastic bottle.  A metal axe doesn't require metal.  You might have to chop down an entire tree to make one axe handle.  A pair of flippers requires seaweed but also requires vine goo, which is made from seaweed.  When you eat soup, the bowl disappears.  Some items are so expensive to make, they're barely worth using.  

It's annoying, but I got used to it.  The crafting recipes fuel the gameplay:  that constant desire to keep floating along.  You can't just stay in one place because you have everything you need.  You have to keep sailing, keep collecting, keep building.  It's shamelessly addictive, but I love it.  

But probably the most brilliant aspect of Raft is actually its pacing.  There's a vague three act structure to it, but all three acts are enjoyable in a different way.  In the first act, you're trying to catch enough junk to survive.  In the second act, you've established your ability to survive and you need to improve your technology enough to sail to a specific destination.  By the third act, your raft is a smoothly running machine and the locations you're visiting are now larger than ever.  Its pacing is not exactly slow, but it is deliberate.  You're not moving quickly, but you are always moving.  I'm not even going to spoil the various locations you can visit, because some of those are frankly brilliant.    

Honestly, once you get past - or rather, get used to - the grind, this is just a wonderful, engaging game.  I can't believe it's still not finished. I've played hundreds of hours but the developers are still promising new stuff to build and new locations to visit.  I hope they wrap it up to a satisfying conclusion, but I suspect I will keep playing even if they don't.  

I love this game so much. I hope you do too.  Thank you for reading this."

Update 28/07/22 - omg this game is absolutely amazing! The final update is the cherry on top! The extra characters make replaying the game for people who have had the game in beta so much fun. The story is so compelling. AND THE BOSS LEVELS?!? so cool!

22341,"Played thru the currently released chapter 2 and have to say it’s one of the best story/survival games I’ve seen in a while. Definitely a “play with friend” type of game full of adventure and funny times. As for the story it leaves you wondering what else happened, which is why I’m keep my eyes on the blog for future updates so my friend and I can swing back into our save and complete the new chapter. 10/10"

22354,"Raft is a pretty nice laid back survival crafting game.   It isn't the best I have played but it certainly is worth the price I paid for it.   I can see myself coming back to it, and plan on picking up my daughter a copy to coplay with her.   I have only put two hours in so far and still learning the ropes but for the most part it is straight forward enough that if you have played this sort of game before you should be able to pick it right up without any issues.

The graphics are simple, but nice.  Personally I like the art direction.  I have some survival/crafting games that go for realism which is great as well, but in the case of Raft it really fits the laid back mood.

During my two hours of playtime so far, I only had some bug, of course the game is still in EA so I can't complain.  The bug was that I was chopping down a tree on an island and poof I was suddenly in the ocean and nothing (savage or my raft or the island) was anywhere to be seen, just open waves and rain), even the shark didn't show up.    I just killed myself and respawned.

Over all I give the game I strong 8/10 so far.   It is certainly a fun and unique game in a genre that is crowded it is hard to be unique so you have to give it props there."
22355,"The updates have saved this game.  It is now has enough content and plot to satisfy my ""open world crafting"" needs.  Perhaps it's my getting older, but the music and tempo of the game have become increasingly appealing to me.  The ceiling is very high for this game and it one i'm happy to have in my library."
22356,"Raft is a game that showed me a few fears that I didn't know I had. The game has really pretty visuals and nice music. The actual gameplay isn't completely story-based and you can play for hundreds of hours without finishing the story, if you so choose. The combination of all the elements makes me really enjoy this game. I do very much recommend playing with friends, though... It makes the game so much more fun!"
22357,More fun with friends

22368,"One of the more fun coop survival games available on steam. Do yourself a favor and play the game without using the wiki or watching YouTube tutorials. It is way more fun and exciting for you and your merry band of idiots to fail to progress, get lost, and die to the shark than to have a perfectly efficient, min/maxed playthrough. The building mechanics feel ripped right out of Rust, which is not a bad thing! The surprisingly deep and macabre lore of the game leaves you constantly excited for what each chapter brings next. I look forward to whatever the devs do with the rest of the game."
22369,NO
22370,at first it felt so hard I felt like i couldn't play it. but making advancements made everything feel easier and smoother. its a satisfying challenge and a beautiful adventure.

22391,"Fun, relaxing game.

One of the best progression systems I have ever seen. It gently encourages you to experiment, and every bit of progress fundamentally changes the game. Minor example: once you have water bottles, It's hard to even remember thirst was once the biggest threat."
22392,"This is an amazing game, I have not been so enthralled with a survival game in a long time. The crafting is intuitive and the gameplay is phenomenal. It's hard to believe this is an early access game, I would 100% recommend."

22400,"At initial glance of other gamer's, I was hesitant to buy in fear that it would be too much for a single player to handle (prefer solo play). I...was...wrong!!! Once I played for a few hours, I was hooked :] I would imagine it is very entertaining to any hunter/gatherer player, so many things to collect and make! However, if you prefer more of the fighting type of adventure play, I would still say give it a chance. Because it keeps you going, on your toes, and rarely left with nothing to do."

22455,"so like I like to kill fishey in ocean type thing, its' fun when the shark go ARG!!!11 and then you go, NAh. and stab with spear, very good like when I went to the supermarket with my life and I was relaxing. I tripped on a bana peal. I realized life aint what you think, its bananas! then I fell down and download raft on stream. this is how I love games."
22456,"Quite good game for co-op.
Currently the game hold about 150 in game days (~50h) of content, unless you're a interior designer, in which case you might switch your tools to this :-)

22468,.
22469,It's a Good game but very grindy but it helps me to be calmed by playing this game its very relaxing
22470,"game = no poopoo
"
22471,love it when my raft disappear`s into an island
22472,this game is so good its even better with friends but i have none
22473,good try but key mechanics are klunky at best. chore of a game. not all bad but mediocre at best. not for me though.
22474,420/69 good game
22475,much good
22476,"is good
"
22477,"You've played for 28 hours
Would you recommend this game to other players?"
22478,"This game feels very repetative after a while. Mainly because there is like 8 different islands, This could be fixed simply by having more possible islands that spawn. Why not just make 40 potenential islands instead of 8 especially when its one of the main parts of the game."
22479,Fun
22480,"very fun when bored
"
22481,relaxing
22482,"Very relaxing but can be very adrenaline pumping if you fall of the raft! overall its a unique game with a boat load of creativity, trust me that was corny"
22483,Tons of fun with friends! The amount of laughs and bickering make it such a unique social experience all while being a laid-back and enjoyable survival game.
22484,"every time you want to play you have to restart steam which can be annoying, although the game itself is well made. Sometimes seeing where objects are to grab them can be difficult but it's not that much of a hassle. Overall, 9/10 rating."
22485,yes
22486,good
22487,hbox conned me into this 10 dollar purcahse i couldve put that away towards my robux fund
22488,lots of fun. lots of sharks.

22490,"This game is a fun time waster, if you just wanna hang out and have a relaxed time collecting stuff in the sea and building an ocean raft."
22491,i can sacrafice my friend to a shark
22492,shark go brrr
22493,good good very good
22494,"How is it? I did not move sail position I just put it up waited a short time and put it back down. I was moving toward the the first marker, then I put sail up to work around a small island. When I put the sail back down I was getting farther from island and no matter where I moved sail I could not get the raft to move closer to first marker. Before I put the sail up I was 561 from it now I am anchored 744 from it . My Raft is very large does that make it harder some how. I do not know how to get there, It seems impossible. Been doing nothing but trying to get there for last 8 or so hours??????????????????
I really enjoyed the game until this, but I guess I am done with it now :("
22495,"uh cool and epic. very grinde if you like those games, very fun"
22496,it's only fun to play with friends so I hope you have friends otherwise do not get this game.

22516,i love it but i cant find the reserch thing for the smelthery
22517,"Raft is a great game, even solo. But the game really shines in co-op. I've now played it with 2, 3 and 7 people, and all of the times were really fun! The time between updates are a bit too slow though, and there is only around ~15-20 hours of story content to play at the moment.

Recommended if you have someone to play with!"

22556,Good cooperative game
22557,"Fun

Like Minecraft  on water"
22558,Raft is a survival game where you collect resources and expand your raft as well as explore islands and be careful for the shark
22559,"Game như cái lồn ,Trash game , Steam is Garbage now I  going to Epicstore"
22560,i absolutely love this game
22561,"Our friend deceived us to jump out of the raft claiming he needed help, 2 seconds later we hear engines..

Rip us."
22562,very very very fun
22563,you can fight sharks and stuff and build boats so its pretty cool
22564,Its good
22565,good
22566,THIS game is awsome but i got stuck at vastgan or call it the boat

22578,let us move when in creative mode it is more fun. Or just make creative like the story and just let us go through the main campain while in creative mode. It is something I have always wanted
22579,best game ever
22580,fun worth a try
22581,This is a 4 year old game with one of the worst fighting mechanics I have ever seen. Movement by the player and animals is hilariously bad. I really do not understand how it reaches 94% approval rating with mechanics that boring and anger inducing.
22582,"Loved it, wish there was more"
22583,"u sail and you find island 
good"
22584,"It takes a while to get used to the mechanics, and there's very little in the way of a tutorial, but once you have the hang of it this game is a lot of fun. It gives you wide-ranging freedom when it comes to designing and customizing your floating home, which is honestly what I'm here for."
22585,"I was looking for an adventure game similar to the Subnautica series, so I gave this a try. I'm glad I did - while Raft does not have the beauty, humor or slick mechanics of Subnautica, it has a good story and interesting challenges to solve.

My main complaint is the graphics and interface are clunky and downright ugly in places. You hit letter E to interact with most things in this game. Be prepared to wear out your E key.

On the plus side, I enjoyed the challenges of sailing my raft, finding islands and structures to explore, crafting tools and just surviving in this watery world. There are some good puzzles with various ways to solve them."
22586,nice
22587,"ok
"
22588,i got a pilot hat
22589,fun with friends
22590,"This is a very fun action game. If people like games where you are stranded at sea, then you would like this game."

22596,"A nice chill game. perfekt to calmdown with after a stressfull day with work and kids 'n sh#t.
Its still an early access game and i'm excited for future updates of the game. Hope for some more enviromental things. Like a more warm feeling when you hiding in your shelter on a stormy night for an example, and more wildlife in the ocean and sh#t like that. Would be nice with more build options on the raft, even tho it already got a lot of possibilities. 
The game make you money worth, in my opinion."
22597,NICE GAME
22598,"Where do i start? Its a fantastic game! The music is just impeccable. The game play feels so smooth, Raft is one of those games where i can get lost just exploring the random islands whilst not continuing the story. I love it. Cant wait for chapter 3 with even more content!"

22650,Its really fun and kind of reminds me of minecraft a little because you can build basically anything you want in raft and there is a great story line that has you waiting anxiously for the next update.
22651,I boarded my raft and began cleaning the ocean.  Realized someone is creating this endless pollution.  Collected even more and built an empire out of garbage.  So MUCH FUN!

22675,"Somehow, its a horribly addictive, fun and relaxing game.
Yes you might starve to death, or get eaten by a shark... or a bear... or drown.

But there is something magical and meditative about sailing around on the ocean, alone.

Beautiful game."

22677,good
22678,"Quirky game that quickly loses it's charm, do not buy at 20$. The survival and hoarding aspect of the game is fun but after awhile it simply becomes a chore. A lot of the tools and items you use are consumed (like why the heck are you using up an entire bucket when you cook, but not when you just drink from the bucket???).

The ""main story line"" is very tiresome to complete and is not very engaging."

Mechanics are fun and a joy to learn, Bruce is annoying (in a good gameplay way, trust me), and once you figure out how to gather resources in abundance, this game became even more fun and a world of building opened up for me. Survival and combat is fun and amazingly well done, keep up the amazing work!"

22713,"i would recommend this to anyone that love survival game especially because its unique based on how you play it, the environment, the enemy and the story itself. this game still in early access so more potential in future update. overall good game"

22719,Fun to play alone or with friends :)
22720,Amazing game!
22721,"Let me make it clear for the people that are still thinking whether or not to get this game.
Straight off the bat, if you think this is a survival game. DONT BUY IT.
There is no surviving involved. Once you get past the learning curve(AKA learn how to get food and build) You will wonder. Whats next? The next is one of these 3 options:

1. You explore the endless ocean, only to find islands with the same resourses as before and make new items such as an upgraded spear
2. You start completing the story, but find out that its frustratingly boring and involves you just traveling to a spot, getting a thing and then going to another spot. You get bored and either complete the game. Or just leave it
3. Screw story and exploring right? You decide that Surviving is fun in this game. So 2 hours in the game you build a nice little raft with a kitchen and a garden. Whats next? Nothing. Getting water & food in this game is the easiest thing to do and isnt fun at all.

Summary

Exploration - 3/10
Story 3/10
Surviving - 1/10

If you like games that involve stories that just make you go from one place to another - buy it.
You wont stumble across ANYTHING new. Unless you place story mode. Which is boring.


But one good thing that is in this game is building the actual raft. It is actually fun to customize your raft."
22722,One of the best games I've ever played. 10/10
22723,its a fun survival game
22724,fun game to play with friends recommend playing on hard difficulty otherwise story line to quick
22725,"There is a raft.
You may survive or die, as you please.
10/10."
22726,"A good exploration/survival that is a must for the genre lovers. The multiplayer is fun, the story is enticing, and the constant updates are always bringing more to the flooded world. Would recommend for everyone to try it, and looking forward to seeing whats to come! Just watch out for them seagulls."
22727,This is the type of game you play when you want to relax and not have to think too much. The story is simple but compelling and I found myself at the end excited to see where they go next. If you enjoy the ocean in real life and you're a fan of survival games you'll enjoy this game.
22728,good game with friends
22729,The game is very fun. 10/10
22730,pretty fun if you have others that play this.

22748,alone pretty shit with friends pretty good
22749,"I love the game.  The graphics are excellent, simple, and playful.  The story is pretty complete.  There is always something to do in Raft (sometimes there is too much to do).  However, you don't even need to do the story to enjoy yourself.  Remember that this is still an early access game, and it is not complete.  Also, the first few days of the game are a constant fight for survival."

22771,"I highly recommend this game, it's cute, super addictive and easy to play when you get into it. I have been itching for a survival/ building type of game that wasn't Minecraft or Stardew, and I got my fix here.

The only 2 cons I found:

1) It gets repetitive after awhile, and the new content doesn't feel like it comes out fast enough. 
2) There is no controller support! I wanted to play with my gf who isn't a gamer but will occasionally try games with me if she can use a controller so I was a bit disappointed. 

Otherwise 10/10

22786,supiriiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiii
22787,"fun game, but one of the worst update schedules I've even seen for an ""Early Access Game"". The expectations are set by the price, not the size of the team, they absolutely owe it to the players to invest in the team. games like astroneer, grounded, craftopia, and other similarly priced games have released so much content in the time since raft's last major update. In two years all they can release is pretty walls and still call their game 'early access' is a big dump on the players.

chapter 3 amendment tldr: All the new content is on the islands, thought this was a game about rafting? Plus the titanium grind is the worst way I've seen collecting a material in a video game, its long, RNG, tedious and all for tiny amounts compared to what you need. Plus you've basically completed the game at the point you get all titanium recipes. Need to see titanium gathering changed, as well as preferred if chapter 3 included literally any new raft feature that isn't just an upgraded tool or component."

22789,this game is very fun to play with friends
22790,GOOD
22791,A more fun version of Minecraft but in the ocean.

22793,yes
22794,"Great game but I only recommend playing with friends. if you do play with friends it is very fun and a game you would want to grind, unfortunately there is not a whole lot to do after you do grind but still fun nonetheless."
22795,"Awesome game, I was so sad when it was over. 

Can't wait for more content to release!"
22796,You can throw your used car batteries in the ocean
22797,"Great Game , love the multiplayer , a little hard to get used to other than that an amazing game. The graphics and water physics are a little buggy tho."
22798,It was fun for the little bit of time that i played with my friend but was a little buggy too
22799,"I'd rather meet a real shark than meet this one once more. 

Since when did sharks stop earing humans and switched to wood?"
22800,I just have to yes on this. Listen here honey... This is a very fun story-driven game. It's multiplayer and can also be very addicting. The story in itself (tho I don't read a lot of the notes) is interesting. Can't wait to see where the story will take me and again I totally recommend this game.
22801,"Great game, some things are really annoying when playing by yourself, and i really recommend playing with friends"
22802,"supa high level tactic remember that yea?
"
22803,yasss queen
22804,sure
22805,"Great game. You have options to play different difficulties so there's a bit for everyone. Multiplayer is great with friends and shenanigans are soon to follow. Even once you find all POI in game, you can revisit them for more supplies. Building aspect is simple with premade items and simple block building style. Bring your imagination and have some fun turning a simple 4 square raft into a full blown ship!"
22806,good
22807,its hard at first but after that its so fun would definitely would recommend!
22808,IT IS A LOT OF FUN
22809,"Little difficult, difficulty level very similar to the Ark games, fun and once you really get going (which only took me and my dad a couple of hours) the materials are easy to grab and it's kinda like those games in creative mode with sharks and some other survivalist stuff. Not usually my sort of game, but it's close to some of the more cutesy story-survival games with the building aspect and ""research"" for new recipes so we gave it a try and I play it a lot more than my dad! Fun for both of us though cause we're both like at a similar skill level, which doesn't exactly happen because he's an avid programmer and game-player and can manage some of the bigger ones like Final Fantasy fairly easily, and I am only good at Stardew Valley and Garden Paws. Also, being able to keep the inventory when you die in the easier modes is very convenient because you respawn right on the raft, so you can still take short trips to the difficult places on islands or jump off to grab barrels and kind of take advantage of that when you're still not exactly handling the thirst and hunger stuff. :)"

Big review of the full version and the 3rd chapter, in the last paragraph
(this is my second acc for eng reviews)
To begin with, many people will not like ""Raft"" as a ""survival"" game, because its not another multiplayer endless grind game with a similar name (if you know what I mean😉), 
Raft - This is exactly the Story-driven survival game, yes, at the beginning you will have to farm a lot to develop the raft and your ""equipment"" with resources to a normal state, but after 10-15 hours, elements such as hunger/ thirst/firewood in the game become a pure ""formality"" , you start living a ""full"" life and upgrade technology for more speed, more damage, longer stamina, etc. And there is nothing wrong with that, since the plot locations in the game are made impressively. Let's stop a little, we must recall a funny detail that Raft generally began as a concept-game for YouTube, in the initial versions (2016) of the game itself had nothing to do, everyone was simply ""hooked"" by the uniqueness of such a survival concept, although, it is based on a banal idea, has been filmed many times in many films, however, no one has done such game before. 
Now I’ll tell you right away about the plot, and, in the final paragraph, about the new final 3-rd chapter, in particular, with minor spoilers. Everything is very simple, the apocalypse, the whole world was flooded, but there are rumors about a certain ""Utopia"", a city where the remnants of humanity could normally live in large enough numbers, and the main goal of our sea voyage is to find out this. I am addicted for such indie projects, with the authors ""enthusiasm"", it is felt that they tried to come up with new even more and more interesting settings that the player should discover, put their soul into it, in short) From the examples I can remember last year my 🥈TOP-2 game of the year - ""Embr"", this is also a small low-budget indie project, on release it had only a couple of locations and only the main mechanics core, but then the developers ""invested"" a bunch of content in the final version.
In general, in the Raft you will find a wide variety of story levels that you can only imagine in such a world, these are houses on rocks, and glaciers, and a floating city, and a flooded building, and a raft-city, it seems to me that it was simply impossible to come up with more, the game is perfect in this regard, although, again, do not forget that this is a very low-budget product, you will be forced to fight a lot with bears or similar aggressive creatures.. and, doing a lot of jumping, well, the first is with corny weak animations (like any other animations in similar projects).. and, 1-button combat, i.e. don't expect interesting battles here, ""just come, hit, run back, repeat"",
But with the second one, you will have to ""torment yourself for the idea"") The jumping sections themselves are always interesting, but jumping here is a nightmare, probably because of this, the game does not support the gamepad. It's all forgivable, but still minus of the game, and I should have warned. You will also have to solve puzzles that are quite good, moderately easy, moderately difficult. I also need to say about the notes, the plot in them is very weak, it`s very badly and incomprehensibly written, there is literally a text of 100 words, moreover, 10 names of different characters are crammed into it, about which it wasn’t written before, why?) Since the notes are so short and there are so few of them, make 2 characters for the whole game, but well write their storyline, but by chapter 2 it still gets better and notes at least from two locations for me personally to read it was quite exciting.
But even if you are not interested in the plot, the game will ""hook"" you in with an incredible atmosphere, the raft here.. as a hub.. to which you return between levels for food and supplies, which you need to develop not only at your own discretion, but also at the discretion of the others your friend-travelers,a fun co-op adventure that no other co-op game can offer yet,
❗Playing Raft alone is prohibited) By the way, max. players mabe even up to 8, and.. also Raft offers you
Craft, about which I don’t have much to say, there are even more raft building recipes than I was interested in building) New buildings are quite interesting to open, in this aspect the game is perfect, as well as with the visual of the game, the designs/picture are awesome, incredible, and stuff like that)

📍 And now, the most relevant, a small review of the final 3-rd chapter:
3 locations, 1-st is a little boring and poorly detailed, but good, beautiful, 2-nd is cool, gives a vehicle that you can ride, new cable pulling mechanics+new beautiful dangerous place for which you will be given special suits, 3-rd location is already very similar to one of the 2 chapters, but it still looks quite original, it will have more platforming and a new mechanic of dragging boxes with which you can climb on the roofs of buildings, there are puzzles on each location, with each level more and more difficult , but not too much, there will be 2 bosses, the first is good, the final is so-so. It takes about 7 hours, in principle, the same thrill as the second chapter, on the high level, except that this is the finale, and I want to cry😢.. well, we hope for some kind of dlc where you will need to create a new, completely different raft, because the maximum has already been ""squeezed"" out of these mechanics.
They could even come up with some kind of pvp spin-off, where rafters could fight each other, raid rafts, but all this risks becoming a donation garbage.

🏆 Raft😏 - A unique experience of atmospheric, ""chill"" travel with friends on a shared raft, with a budget but interesting plot.

22822,yEEt
22823,it is a good game to play and relax
22824,i play it a lot with my friends and do recommend. I love the idea of being stuck on a raft where you have to survive on what you have and what the islands and ocean give you.
22825,its kinda boring
22826,"I feel like the addition of character creation/customization would make this game a 10, I don't really like either of the character models. Other than that it's good fun!"
22827,njhjbhjbh
22828,"I very much love this game, I've still yet to beat it as I dump a week into it at a time and then stop near the endings lol.
One complaint I have though is the game randomly every fee minutes super tanks in frame rates, thankfully this game isnt super reliant on needing 60 fps but it does get annoying, especially the main plot areas, the ship absolutely tanks in frames"
22829,"I love this game! Sometimes I play because of an update, sometimes I play just because and no matter what I always enjoy my play through.... I JUST found out that putting metal (iron) upgrades on my raft cause the shark not to eat my boat. I am a hoarder in games and thought that if I used my precious metal that the shark would just eat it and I would constantly have to replace it, but this last play through I made a tiny-tall raft and I was swimming in iron so i figured ""Why Not"". T.T
I also LOVED the renovation update! My husband had to tolerate our cotton candy raft, getting all of the flowers from the islands and shooing those damn birds from my flower crops :D while I fished, cooked, chopped trees and updated all of our raft."
22830,"If you want to play a chill game with some friends or solo, raft is a great pick.
"
22831,very addictive
22832,"Nice gameplay, I would recommend this game to other players.
Pro : Many place to explore
Con : Too much water

22833,"Really fun in ALL difficulties!! I get stressed out when playing games. So I tend to play them on peaceful/easy. Often times easy/peaceful is really boring and I usually quit playing really quickly. Not with this game! Despite playing in peaceful this  game is still challenging, fun and there are so many things you can do and ways you can play. Definitely recommend!!"
22834,"the shark is friendly
"
22835,great
22836,"A perfect place to spend a few evenings. Playable both single and with friends.
Just don't expect too much of it: updates come pretty rarely, so you wouldn't get lost for too long."
22837,"One of the best survival games out there, with lots of things to do for an early access one.
-Highly customizable raft, you can make a whole ship or a floating city with enough time.
-Cool things to craft and discover to accelerate simple tasks like getting water or travelling.
-Feels great to play coop, get 2-4 friends and you'll not regret it.
-Decent story, makes you want to continue and wait for the next update. Every story location was incredible, the feeling when you see one of them from your raft as you get closer is just unique.
-There's also a few secrets that I enjoyed discovering.

Obviously there's a few things to improve like in every early access game. There are no more than 10 island variations so they become repetitive, there's no character customization, and some items functions need some polish, etc. But as I can see from dev blogs, most of these are being checked and improved soon."
22838,Great fun for the family to play together.
22839,"good to play with friends
or not"
22840,"This game...
     The very first few hours are filled with a little bit of wonder and alot of frustration. This is to be expected when dropped into a survival game with no guide whatsoever, but the challenge is what make the reward so great.
     I died so many times in the first 3-5 hours playing on Normal. Just when i thought i got the hang of it, Boom! A rock comes flying from the sky, or i'm impaled against the wall, or Bruce just got the better of me. Every time I died I restarted from the beginning, almost like hardcore but not quite there yet.
     34 hours in I'm not in the story yet, I've got two games where I'm just building up my ships and exploring. Why two games? Well one is for the tryhard in me, and the other one is when I've had a couple drinks.
     All in all, I HIGHLY RECOMMEND this game if you are fans of similar games such as Stranded Deep, Subnautica, Craftopia, Don't Starve, etc.



"
22841,"this game is so fun whit friends
"
22842,"Very fun game! Once you make actual story progress though it feels really short and stuff ends up being, not necessarily easy, but just simple and no real challenges come your way. The crafting system is pretty good, and its best with friends. Once you get stuff going on your raft its very satisfying. I don't recommend at full price at its current state of release - catch the sales. Once the next chapter, or more chapters come out, 100% definitely check it out."
22843,Insanely fun game!
22844,Very chill game with friends
22845,Bruce is mean
22846,We all float down here
22847,Great relaxing game by yourself or with friends. If you like crafting and coop as a break from the murder hobo games then this is for you.
22848,I bought this because of Let's Game It Out on youtube. Worth it
22849,Good
22850,Its aight
22851,"I love the crafting, the references to real world things (some serious, some humourous), the interesting story development, and the peaceful floating on the ocean (the soundtrack really helps make this kind of mesmerising)"

22864,"I enjoy the building aspect. However, the raft will not let me build anything from the hammer menu other than foundation. This includes walls, stairs, supports, etc."
22865,awesome sauce
22866,"In my opinion, it's okay. I hated playing solo, but if you're with friends it's a lot more fun, and easier! The sharks make me want to yeet myself off a bridge, I'll give the creators props to their updates though, they keep coming out with great content!"

22881,lets be honest here in raft your gonna die at least once but between the crafting and storyline it is a great game now go survive on a raft

22928,good agme
22929,"EDIT: I'm so proud of the developers for finishing this game. It's wonderful and I'm so excited to now be able to play all the way through, thank you.

--

PRO: All in all, I definitely recommend this game. It is a bit grindy at times, but aren't all survival games? It's very fun to play as a group, or solo if you enjoy a longer more laid back play style. I love this game. I played it years ago before it was on steam, and I've just recently had the time to come back to it. It's still a blast. 

CON: Things is though it's been in early release for four years now, and I personally am suspect as to whether or not it's going to be finished. I wish they would just write a script that explained the ending and stopped dragging the players along waiting for game play updates every few years. I love this game and supported the dev's in the beginning and I still do, but I think it's going to be years before this thing is done, not to be dramatic but it's been in some form or another of early release for literally half a decade. For context, when I started playing this game I was in high school, I've since finished my undergrad, and it's still not done."
22930,love this  game but 10x better with friends

22934,"Water. Water never waters...
The Waters watered water to water waters and water.
Water built water from its water for water and water.
Water shaped a Watered Water into a water water.
But water never waters.

In the 21st water, water was still watered over the water that could be watered. Only this time, the water of water were also its waters: Water and Water. For these waters, Water would invade water, the Water would annex Water, and the Water Water would water into watering, watering water-water, bent on watering the last remaining water on Water.

In 2077, the water of water water had come again. In two brief waters, most of the water was reduced to waters. And from the waters of water water, a new water would struggle to water.

A few were able to water the large waters. Your water was part of that water that entered water.

22950,Boat Go brrr
22951,"Hey there, I'm IOTA and I played this game! For a long time!
Raft is an extremely enjoyable and even relaxing experience, depending on the gameplay settings. At Hard it can be a gruelling challenge, while Creative mode offers an opportunity to design and experiment in a consequence-free space.
The majority of my playthrough has been on Easy mode - it still takes time and effort to work through the game and it is totally possible to starve/dehydrate to death or be killed by an animal, but the setbacks are less frequent and less severe. Normal is more difficult but still worthwhile as a solitary player. I only recommend Hard for players in groups or those specifically looking for a difficult voyage.
In my opinion,  if you are looking for a game that involves a fun crafting mechanic combined with a cool waterworld adventure this is a very good buy. 
Two important tips: 1. if you have any issues with motion sickness or dizziness, make sure to turn off the wave motion in the settings. 2. the game can only be paused if you select the option ""Nobody else can enter"" when you are loading the game."
22952,"Really enjoying this game, me and my husband have been playing it together and have found it to be challenging at times - shark is all i will say ha! 
The way the game has been developed always keeps you on your toes and always on the lookout. 
The building aspect is good, i have enjoyed the building element - but i'm not an amazing builder! 
We like the concept of unlocking things after you've researched things.
If you're looking for a game that -
1. You can play alone or with friends
2. Enjoy a challenge and learning as you go
3. Good graphics and interesting game play.
4. Has a story although you have to find out why you're on a raft!
5. Like to be attacked by sharks and scare off seagulls....

then you will enjoy this game!"

22992,"It's a good game, but once you've done everything it gets boring without a friend.

The gameplay is the same thing over and over with next to no variation.

Play through it once, and then do so with a friend, and then wait for a new content update. Rinse and repeat."
22993,love it
22994,This Game is pretty fun if you enjoy building but the missions you're supposed to do need a little more info.

23036,"Game has a nice concept, but poor design choices take most of the fun away. I'd recommend other similar games."
23037,your loot goes void when you die unless you play co-op and a friend can come save you. id liked if it had an option to go retrieve your stuff in single player but there isnt. other than that its very fun!

23044,"game is really relaxing and always has new surprises for you to explore, out of 5 stars ill rate 5 stars and a message to the raft  game creators - in creative mode, please put stuff in the oceans, make the game beatable, spawn items in the river, make the raft move and add islands back as i would like to see this update"
23045,so good i played it for 10 hours
23046,me n friends = kill sharks n lamas
23047,"Please consider my comment as first 2 hours preview, I haven't experienced everything yet but I do have early comment.

First thing first, there is no orientation to the game as far as I can see. No tutorials, no story lines etc. But checking the comments here on Steam, there should be a story. I didn't see it, I don't know where it is. Again, according to the comments I understand that you can also land on islands but I didn't know that as in my experience your are just thrown into the ocean.

There are some bugs, not annoying (yet) but needs to be fixed. The most common one was the hook glitch. Even though  there were no obstacles in front of me, sometimes the hook bounces back to my hand or it goes somewhere unrelated. It happened more during the storms.

Besides all the problems above, it looks lika a good casual survival to me. I did enjoy my limited time on it but absolutely looking forward for more."

23049,Nice *easy* game to play. The hard part is to convince your friends to not troll around the boat. Also if you get sea sick or dizzy idk if you should play it

23054,It was really fun with other players and by myself but once you start the missions it went by really fast. I think they need to add more to the story line to keep the game fun.

23065,great game! if you need a little bit of a challenge in your survival game. i just think it needs a bit of a tutorial.

23116,fun
23117,Quite good but after playing it for about 40mins you kinda get sick of waiting to get to an island and wait to get water or wait for food to cook
23118,"A relaxing game where survival is key lol. I thoroughly enjoy this game. The graphics are amazing. Gameplay is fantastic along with the UI. Overall, I give this game a 10/10."
23119,"Even though its most likely intended for kids, it still a fun game for the adult (gaming) sailor, glad my brother introduced me to it.
Been having lots of fun making my own custom raft, love the sailing aspect and exploration. 
Resource management is not too laborious and things can get automated which is a real nice feature.

Story wise its interesting however its done well enough to make you feel isolated as the story progresses, revealing
a dark undertone of the human impact on the environment. Highly recommend it, great game to play with friends.
At the moment it can be a little short, of course that's if you are replaying it. But it still has much replay-ability, a big bonus is that it has lots of cool content being added and devs are very active."

23132,"Raft is really addicting, my boyfriend got this for us to play on date night, and we check out the time at one point in time and it is like 2 AM and we had started playing during the day.  I really like the concept, and I really want to find out more about the game and how best to craft certain items, but it has an addicting nature to it.  When you first start out, enemies are a lot harder than when you progress and we haven't even touched the quests yet, but I look forward to playing many, many more hours of this!  One thing that I think would be really helpful is for us to craft a book to put all the recipes in so we don't have to store each individual one."
23133,Great game and loads of fun with friends!
23134,
23135,"In early access for 4 years now, the game is playable as it is but once you did the main story, there's not much more to do.
This is NOT a bad game but it lack of new content, also i expected more replayability, that's why i don't recommand it actually."
23136,Fun
23137,"Balanced. That is the word that comes to mind most. When you start there is some grind to survive. getting food and water for your character keeps you busy. once you progress, food and water become secondary or tertiary and you begin to discover all of the wonderful things about the game. Its not just floating around on a raft and hooking items out of the ocean. It really feels like a world. Empty, yet full, all at the same time."

The story locations are the strongest part in my opinion (so much so it actually gets a little disappointing when you catch up with the current implemented story), followed closely by some of the best base-building mechanics I've ever personally seen.  It's really intuitive and snappy, and there's a lot of potential for customization.  I'd really recommend playing this game with a friend or group, as that's where I had the most fun, but you do you!"

23262,"3 more hours to 400 hours spent on this game and so here are 3 things I've learnt about this game.
1. I am but a mere slave on the raft. 
2. apparently eating underwater is a thing now. 
3. using fireworks on the seagulls is the best part of completing chapter 2."

23267,"Fun survival type game, We started playing due to some youtubers we watch that are also starting to play. Did have one major glitch...

 My game glitched when a boar charged me and at the same time my spear broke, it had my screen shaking like the boar was hitting me but i couldnt do anything to stop. Couldnt even quit the game. finally my health dropped and I died.

23287,very fun and addicting
23288,good
23289,OH NO!!!! THERE IS A VERY SCARY SHARK IN THIS GAME!!!!!!
23290,"this game is a joy, i would easily recommend this to anyone(if my 300+ hours in the game didn't say enough). Firstly, the game looks fantastic and is able to run on most devices with medium graphics settings. however with the highest graphics settings it can be more demanding. You might encounter a couple glitches and bugs on your play through but the game is in early access at the time of writing this and i'm sure those will be fixed in the future. Now to get into the game play, its a blast. While repetitive at times, it is a delight to craft, build your raft, sail the open seas, etc. it is one of my most replayed games and it really never gets boring.

There are some negatives. For example, like i said earlier the game play can get a little repetitive. This is mainly when your collecting materials at the random islands and its ultimately rafts biggest weakness, but its really not a major issue. I cant really think of any other negative points other then the story, which is very confusing and isn't all that interesting, but its been confirmed by the devs its getting reworked 

Now for the games biggest positives, the multiplayer and the progression. About the multiplayer, Raft is a much better game with a friend. Splitting your tasks to maintain your raft with your friend makes the game much more enjoyable and its just really fun to build your raft together and just talk with each other while sailing to a new destination. Speaking of destinations, the progression in this game is amazing. It involves going to special islands that come out with each update(called chapters) that so far, in my opinion, have only gotten better and better. I cant say much more about the destinations without spoiling them so you'll just have to play them for yourself.

In conclusion, i love this game and i can go on and on on how great the game is. There are a couple things i haven't mentioned but that's because there's so much that's amazing about Raft. It's an easy 8/10 if your playing alone(in my opinion,) and a 10/10 in multiplayer(again, in my opinion, i enjoy games in multiplayer a lot more then single player) For a price of $20 it's definitely worth it however the game does go on sale every so often. 

this review will most likely get updated with each major update that comes out."
23291,it changed ma life
23292,person stuck on boat then shark likes human
23293,"it sooo coollk
"
23294,"The game is wonderful in the sense that you get to use your creativity and imagination building, while following the story-line.  I have played this game on desktops with only about 4GB Ram and desktops that had as high as 32GB Ram and either way, the performance is excellent.  My only warning:  You can build some pretty exquisite rafts however, I wouldn't build an ocean-liner.  I actually built one based off of the Titanic (132 squares long x 102 squares wide, 8 levels high [including the 3 level hull], 40 engines inside the hull) and this actually caused the game to lag horribly.  And yes, I was using the 32GB gaming desktop at the time.  Chapter 3 to RAFT will hopefully be released this year, so the game stays fresh, from a player perspective."
23295,"I would 100 percent recommend Raft (I mean just look at my play time, at the time of writing this review it is over 400 hours). Things to know,  the game can get a bit repetitive along with the occasional bug or glitch. For the most part Raft is good in terms of any major bugs or glitches so you won’t have to worry about that, and the game is able to run on most devices, I was playing with a laptop 1050 with an 8th gen i5 and I was getting a solid locked 60 fps at 1080p with everything on medium. However, Raft can be more of a demanding game if you put the settings to the max. For instance, I now have a laptop rtx 3060 along with a 7th gen 5000 series processor, and with everything at max along with playing at 2560x1600 (1440p) resolution, and I average about 75fps. If I lower the resolution to 1680x1050 I can get a locked 165 fps which is my monitor's refresh rate in the open ocean, but on the special chapter islands the performance usually drops to around 120-130 fps. The next big point to bring up about this game is the gameplay and the story. Personally I don’t follow the raft story, but that is because in order to do so you must collect notes on the story islands and read them. I have tried reading them in the past and they don’t make a ton of sense so in my opinion the story is one of the games weak points, but the Raft developers have already said that they are changing the writing of the notes and adding text to speech for them in the Chapter 3 update which they are currently developing and are expected to release in the coming months. The gameplay is where this game is definitely fun, but also has a flaw. You will be in the ocean gathering trash and making your raft bigger and being able to research more advanced things such as batteries, electric purifiers, sprinklers, etc. You will constantly drift by these small islands which house resources such as sand, clay, metal, copper, seaweed, etc, and harvest them. This is where the flaw comes in because while the loop is fun in the beginning, I at least found that by the end of the game I was kinda getting tired of the loop. However this is all reminded by the games biggest strengths, multiplayer and story islands. This game has fantastic multiplayer which works extremely well (assuming you have a stable internet connection). It is a lot more enjoyable to play with a friend because you are now with someone else and can split up whatever work you are doing in the game, or just have someone to talk to while you're waiting to go somewhere in the game. The game's other biggest strength is the story islands. They release story islands in updates called chapters which currently there are 2 chapters that are done and fully implemented in the game, while the 3rd chapter is currently in development and is presumed to be coming in the coming months at the time of writing in February. Chapter 1 and Chapter 2 have both brought two new story islands along with a plethora of new items to research and craft, with in my opinion each story island being amazing whether it looks really cool, it's fun to explore, or it has a unique idea for gameplay to solve the puzzles on the island. All of the story islands exhibit a lot of each of the traits I just mentioned and are all around amazing to explore and to complete. Overall I would recommend this game with a 8.5/10 if you are playing single player (If you like to play games by yourself then it would be a 10/10, I just prefer to play with other people), and if you are playing in multiplayer it would be a 10/10. Both ways I would still pay the $20 for the game (The game does go on sale quite frequently so if you are hesitant to buy it then I would wait for a sale).

23307,I painted the raft black :(

23309,Yes i do recomend this game. This game has alot of story in it lots of secrets Etc. This game has you stranded on a raft while you have to defend your self aginst  the shark. And when you visit certain islands you can encounter the bird that drops rocks on you. If you like story i reccomend this game there is notes and other things you can read. And not too mention you can mod this game as well. lots of fun too play!

23338,"I like raft of all the games I play.  The endless possibilities for creativity and paths, even within the framework of the game's primary story are a total blast."
23339,i love this game its really good
23340,This game is a unique survival game where you have to get materials on a raft instead of the regular style of survival games where you are on land and get materials the regular way. So if you want a twist on a survival game then this is the game for you. If not then I'd still recommend this because its fun either way.
23341,"Game is super addictive, and once you break the barrier of getting past the beginning, it becomes so much more addictive."

As a casual survival game, YES.
This game is very relaxing when you're sailing around on your raft, but can become slightly stressful with story missions, as you never know what you're going to need (unless you use walkthroughs of course :P)

23423,"OK, hear me out and don't listen to the bad reviews on this game at all. this game is an absolute masterpiece. i would recommend this to ANYONE, and i mean everyone. it is super fun to play with friends and is very family friendly. i am not that good at it and it doesn't matter you can select multiple types of game modes and difficulty's so you can progress along the way, but before you down load i would highly recommend watching some Youtube Videos and asking other people what they think of it.and if you do get it i would urge my friend to get it as well so you can try it out together. it has amazing graphics and audio and VERY soothing music. the visuals are like a million Stars just exploded, and there are very realistic night and day cycles. so if you are looking for a challenging game or just a game to chillax with, this is a great option, overall i rate this game a 13/10"
23424,this game is really fun
23425,everything
23426,"Very nice game.
It starts off slow, enjoyable, and relaxing. 
I've had the best time on peaceful without the shark MESSING WITH ME.
Overall there is continuous support from the developers and updates are added over time.
After a while it gets fun to manage your raft/boat and the story is interesting to go through.

Love collecting and hoarding in video games like Fallout, WoW, Skyrim, League (Loot Boxes), Minecraft, ect. 
Raft DEFINITELY fits that joy.

Still need to finish the story, but I'm happy to continue playing."

23428,Its Honestly a fun game to play just sit back relax and raft baby that's the name of the game its just a vibe to play. just put some music or even watch a video/show in the background and time just drifts past you like your on a RAFT....
23429,"Really enjoyable game to play either solo or with a group of friends! I've done all of the major quest islands thus far, very much looking forward to future updates. Super relaxing and a interesting lore to follow as well. Can't say enough good things about it!"

23434,day 1 : stranded on a plank fighting for the bare minimum to survive -> day 69 : nature provides when you hook with 'er *wink* *wink* -> day 911 : get rekt by a humongus bird that throws shit at ya on the size shape color 'n texture of rocks -> day 1.000 : you're better off painting the raft instead if the shark hadn't had that after-death grudge to rise once again and lunge at you and the bottomless stomach of a beaver. overally good with a lovely sense of karma is a beach you can swim into. And be grrrrrrrreedy ma friends if you have a death wish like the stoned pirate you are.
23435,This game is really fun and has a good discord server if you want help with the game. (The wiki is good too.) I'm still playing this so I haven't done the story line yet but it's really addictive :).

23442,"Raft is okay, at first... I've been playing it for over two or three years? It's okay. 

Until it begins to lag!! Which is VERY FRUSTRATING!!! I can barely walk, run, turn around move some items into a chest. This lag is RIDICULOUS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! I've done everything to try and fix it. I even changed the screen resolution. NOTHING. WORKED. It would be very enjoyable if the lag wasn't so bad. Oh well. It takes me a couple of minutes just to walk/run from one place to another. Also I would like to suggest 2 ideas.

1. The electric purifier should have a solar panel! It would be nice to never have to charge batteries for it!
2. I think there should be oranges, kiwi & dragon fruit on the islands. :)

Raft is fun, I am only not recommending it because of the lagging issue. :((((("
23443,"One of the best survival games in my opinion, best experience with friends and funny with A LOT of friends.
Playing as a duo or a squad is fun, playing with 5+ players is funny and cool because you have to build a huge raft which is a nice tough and suffering to do but is WORTH it when done.

23470,Once I sat back and played the game I loved it. Fun game play and a good story.
23471,"Amazing game, beautiful gameplay. Finished the game 2 times and I'm downloading for a 3rd time now."
23472,its funny play it now
23473,Right now with my new Ryzen 7 5800x CPU and x570 motherboard and a asus rog 240 aio only a few months old and I'm getting temps around 73c-81c... needs to be fixed

23483,"AMAZING GAME. The pacing, the story, the drama, the gameplay, it's all perfect. The balancing can be off sometimes like your HP just being deleted if there are 3 or more rebels around but that didn't deteriorate the experience at all. I loved every second of it."

23490,"Super fun game, whether you're by yourself or with friends. Only a few bugs here and there, but they've done a really good job at trying to be on top of all issues and resolve them. The gameplay is fun and engaging and the mysterious story of the world keeps you looking for islands. Very excited to see what's next for the game!"
23491,"Very cool survival game good to play with friends a bit like minecraft too but better 
"
23492,"Best game for chilling with the boys, wish I could play it for the first time again"
23493,"It have some bugs, but game is fun. Especially with frends"
23494,"The game in its current state is already pretty fun, I've fully explored almost all of the main locations already and I enjoyed it. The survival system can be a bit confusing since there isn't much of a tutorial to explain certain things you have to do. 

Highly recommend you play this with friends because if you're incapacitated you lose all of your items by respawning unless your teammate can bring you to a bed to be revived.

Overall i'd say get this game while its on sale, and i hope it'll remain as fun when more locations are added into the game and the story is continued"

23516,"Its pretty fun but honestly unless you're playing with someone its better to play creative and see what kinda crazy rafts you can come up with. That's not to say its not enjoyable but its definitely more fun playing with someone!
Sometimes the game bugs out but its kinda part of the charm. Except for when it gets wavy and it disrupts the hook use animation. The durability goes down yet you didnt get to use it at all which sucks.
Other than a couple bugs here and there, i love the game.

23530,"I'll admit this game is fun with friends but oh my god is it bad.

There is just SO much micromanaging in this game it's unbelievable.

• You have to eat every five minutes
• Drink every five minutes
• You need wood to eat and drink, so keep collecting wood, never stop
• You need to make tools that cost WAY too much resources, so again, keep collecting wood
• You know those tools you made? They break after ten minutes of use, so now you have to make another one
• You need to constantly repair the raft because sharks keep attacking it

This game is like Subnautica except it lacks all the fun, creativity, and it hates you."

23564,good
23565,Like the game the lore was good to much reading for my liking in the journal and i wish there would have been a boss fight or more dangerous encounters with things like maybe a deep sea creature (giant squid?) or something but it was fun loved the parcore and the puzzles lotta good depth things in place but a bit shallow in others like water for instance i had a bottle and every like 2 minuets i was drinking not enough time to actually turn your attention to the other things about the game without having to run back to your raft to get more water the food on the other hand was fine another thing is sea weed not enough of that to make it worth building a air tank and flippers they would break with in a few minutes maybe add adding a repair factor would help thatbut i beat the game cant say that for alot of other games great survival game over all but it could use some work

23572,good game
23573,"RAFT is an excellent entry into survival craft, but with a purpose / end goal! 

Where Raft really shines, is allowing you to either build and create, OR just playing through the story. You can do either, and it's only as challenging as you make it! 

When it comes to creativity, it has a certain charm, that pulls you in, you're not limited to building ""defensive"" structures, you can really create something that's cozy, and comfortable, while still being practical, without the need for snake-like walls, palisades, traps, and pitfalls, etc...

Now add friends! There's something to be said about the joy of playing with friends, laughing, and just watching ""Bruce"" eat greedy friends, carrying them back to safety, cramming food in their faces, etc...it's a blast whether you're just creating, or playing the story!"
23574,"Raft is a great survival title. 

This game follows the typical survival formula. There is a bounty of crafting options. An open ended story element present enough to for role-players but subdued enough to be ignored by sandboxeers. Immersive disaster elements keep you on your toes and yes you will eat about a dozen fish, radishes and potatoes a day just to stay alive.

The game is cleverly huge. The plotting system and open sea feel creates a sense of travel and space. I am not sure if there is a size cap to the rafts, but I've seen massive rafts the size of cities created by other players.

The controls are customizable fps style. I run the game on a mid-ranged laptop at max frame rates, very well optimized. I've only encountered a ""few stuck on map"" bugs on certain islands but the game has an unstuck feature built into the menu. Also a few respawning issues after death and raft float aways (Despawining) despite being anchored. Very rare though.

Game play is the normal survival chore fest plus exploration. The open sea is just the start. As the game progresses, the mindless drift turns into a navigational journey of quest locations. Each quest location is a pleasurable experience. The puzzles and rewards bring satisfaction despite being on the easier end and for the deep delver, harder earned secrets exist on each map.

As of 2/22 there are 5 maps with plans for a sixth. The current experience is worth the price for sure, but in the future, more maps, community mods and new mechanics will keep this already re-playable title replaying."

My only problem with the game is the required jumping on 2 of the story islands. I just don't have the keyboard dexterity for it. It had me frustrated for a while, trying and trying again. In the end I had to get creative to bypass the jumping."

If anything to improve feel like adding and end goal or objective (such as escaping being stuck at sea eventually) would add more drive to the game, but still a good game nonetheless"

Unfortunately, we were travelling from chapter to chapter so fast that we had no time to read any of the story notes until the very end of the game. We had absolutely no idea what we were actually looking for or what the game's backstory was.

23674,"This is a great game for playing with friends online. This is a survival game where you start off on a tiny raft with nothing but a hook to gather materials. You unlock recipes to build tools and expand your raft, get attacked by sharks, and explore islands. I really got into the cooking part in this game so if you love crafting survival games this one is for you."
23675,"Excellent game, minor bugs relating to water and the hook/fishing rod but besides that very well put together game. Scenery is amazing, and it's even more fun in multiplayer! There's so many goofy things you can do, so many places to discover, that if you're just staring at a hyper-realistic whale and a pod of dolphins, you'll miss another fantastic sight!"

23677,"I love this game so much and am just sitting here trying to fill the void until the next release.  I love the fact that there is a lot to do and there are complexities but it is also relaxed.  Collecting resources and building things is so rewarding, the islands and story are beautiful, and it's a great way to hang out with my sister for hours as we create a mega raft."

23680,"It's Minecraft on a raft. I'm currently playing it with my partner and it's so enthralling that we often play for ""half an hour"" from 9pm till 1am XD. 

There's a Shark that attacks your raft every now and then. It becomes an annoying pest eventually though. Shark Stew for days. I like building the raft into a mobile base for exploring Islands."
23681,M U H... MUH POTATOES
23682,Keeps you entertained for hours
23683,"I'm giving it a thumbs up but I will say that the modding scene makes this game so much more playable and a lot more fun. There are a lot of mechanics in the vanilla game that seemingly make the game drag on for much longer than it has to in hopes of making up for it's lack of content.
The game has been in early access for years, which is never really a good sign; the team look like they're working hard on the game, so any complaints I may have are quelled a bit.
I can't see myself playing long enough to get all of the achievements naturally, but at it's price point I'd say its a really fun time with a group of friends or a duo (not sure about solo)."
23684,"This game is legit! If you enjoy watching your hard work turn into a usable technology that you grow reliant on, this is a good game for you!   It starts as a slow grind, but stays fun! You will be island hopping, farming, hunting, building raft upgrades, and stabbing seagulls well into 40-50 hours of gameplay before you realize that the story line is actually super fun too!"
23685,"good game 
"
23686,"This game is honestly one of my most favorite games and I could honestly keep playing and playing it, it is a good game to calm down to if you play solo and when playing with friends it just makes it even more fun because you can have endless amounts of laughs."
23687,"It is awesome, every bit of gamplay was great. there was some bugs that did kill me but other than that it is awesome, it has a great story, great challage ect. allaround great game"
23688,"A scary but ultimately chilled game, drifting on the ocean current in a sunny blue sea."
23689,
23690,"A lot of building freedom, quite a bit to do and explore, the islands are well made but could use some more variety."
23691,"Huge survival game fan, this game has all the elements a game in this genre requires. The multiplayer portion is also super fun and easy to set up. The fact you do not need to buy a server and can just play with your various steam friends is added value. Look forward to all the updates!"

23710,"Keeps getting updates, great fun for ages and even when you feel you've done it all. BAM and update comes in."
23711,This game is a relaxing vacation for your brain. Float around the endless ocean collecting stuff while trying to survive. The still developing story keeps it interesting and gives you purpose (besides trying not to get eaten by your friend the shark). Great by yourself or multi-player with friends!
23712,"Raft is a relaxing, occasionally zen-like experience as you bob on the open ocean, collecting resources, crafting goodies, both practical and cosmetic, and expanding from a single tiny raft into a massive higgledy piggledy self sustaining ship, occasionally stabbing a shark in the face with a spear (he deserved it) or getting rocks thrown at you by a bird (you deserved it). The survival elements are fairly simple and I find them well-tuned, and islands have become more and more exciting to explore as the game development has progressed. There's even a storyline now which is pretty cool the first time you experience it. There's an excellent balance between the peaceful sea-faring and island exploring and occasionally battling. With the most recent story based updates the game has really expanded, although it's still unfinished and development seems very slow.

[h1]Bring a ""friend"" as shark bait[/h1]

The biggest benefit of Raft to me is the seamless co-op. Hosted on a local machine, your friends can drop in or out of your game effortlessly and help you. If you should want to let them progress without you, which I have done a few times, you can easily send them the file to load. It's not quite as good as it being persistently online, but it's easy enough. I played around 40 hours with my husband and a friend and we pulled together, assigning jobs and positions, working as a team to explore the ocean and the land, baiting the shark away from the others, tucking unconscious bodies into bed, you know, all the sorts of things friends do for each other.

[h1]Chest Wars[/h1]

However, I will warn you that your friendships will be sorely tested when it comes to storage. I cannot tell you how frustrating it was to sort every chest into specific categories, painstakingly labelled with signs, and then find that my husband had dropped wood into my seed box, or scuba gear into my food box. In the end I told him not to touch any of the boxes except the one with his name on it. It staved off divorce. I also got yelled at a few times for re-arranging the rooms, but really, these guys have no interior design skills! Look I'm type A okay, I need order on my boat, even in the apocalypse.

[h1]What's bad?[/h1]

The main drawback is that the development is slower than me running a marathon with ankle weights on. It's getting there, but no one knows when it'll pass the finish line and you're just hoping it doesn't have a heart attack en route. I'm patiently waiting, but I do wish the full experience was ready. It's come a long way from release, but I can't help but feel there's still a ways to go."

23719,"For those that are shitting on this game for "" lack of content "", "" repetitive collecting of resources "", "" not worth the $20 "" or "" tool durability sucks ""... Get over it, at least the creators of this game is putting more effort into fixing the bugs and trying to add more content at the same time(which costs MONEY), unlike some other games that devs don't give a shit about the bugs or content for players to explore and enjoy alone or with friends. 

Watch the trailers or YouTube Reviews on the game before buying to make sure you actually want to own it and play it.

23728,Very gamer just kinda need a lot of processing power compared to other games so yeah.
23729,"Rather than advance the game and make it better they've just increased the difficulty to excruciating levels. Solo play is boring, the resources required to survive is too high. 

Creative aside there's no end-game so even if you do manage to create some of the later stage equipment there's no story to progress, nothing to keep you playing. For the money I spent on this game there are games with much more content that are being updated as a passion project and doing their players a service. This is a hype game which probably saw some streamer popularity and made the devs rich .. why continue making content when they can reap the benefits from good reviews and virality. 

The concept was good but it's fun for a day or two and then there's really no point.

When people say it's 'fun with friends' What they really mean is their friends are fun and this is a small sandbox environment to experience together but as far as longevity of the title, don't expect your money to go far with this game. 

I could've played the 2 hours of steam time before refunding and still feel satisfied I'd experienced all it had to offer."

23759,"GOOOD

23760,Playing solo and losing all items on death kinda ruined my new playthrough i was doing. Not worth continuing and i cant recommend this game based on such a dumb mechanic. Cant even return to spot and loot what you dropped ? come on

23762,"It's not even finished and I feel like the amount of content in this game already is pretty strong. The hunger and thirst can be extremely tedious, but the fun of enduring this blue hell on a 2x2 raft is unmatched in the survival genre."
23763,"Having a shark trying to eat you raft/boat 24/7 is pretty poop. 
Besides that pretty fine game to grind your time of to i'd say so. ¯\_(ツ)_/¯"
23764,raft go brr
23765,"The general progression, exploration and survival aspects are super fun, especially in coop. Unfortunately, as of writing this review it's been 1.5 years since the last real content update. I understand it's a small indie team but that's just a too long period of time. An update to customize and paint your raft happend but that's just gimmicky and pointless regarding story and actual gameplay content. I hope the devs focus on the more exciting aspects of the game in the future and can pick up the pace in that regard!"
23766,"you are on a piece of wood, trying to survive?

then you got attacked by ""the"" shark... decided to get revenge.

finally you managed to kill it... realized it respawned :O

built a contraption to trick it ... it's mind got blown 

you invented shark meat farm."

23777,"Raft is an oceanic survival game developed by Swedish studio Redbeet Interactive and published by Axolot Games. Raft is a survival game set in the perilous ocean, where you start on a small raft with only 4 squares of wood and a hook rope in your hand. From there, you and your friends will gather resources find floating along and collect it in order to use and craft other objects with.

With a dry throat and an empty stomach, survival will not be easy. Apart from gathering ocean debris, you are also able to gather items from small and large islands, as well as scour the underwater reefs for materials. Whilst doing so, you will also have to deal with the never-ending threat of sharks, and other animals that want to kill you such as poisonous fish, bears and warthogs. Not all animals are dangerous though, and you also have the option of bringing on board some domesticated animals such as the Llama, Goats and Chickens.

When I first saw this game a couple of years ago during a free Steam weekend, I was thoroughly impressed as it was unique among the survival games. As you watch the hunger and thirst bars trickly down so quickly, you realise that as cute and cartoony this game looks, it will put you on your toes very quickly and you will be scrambling to find valuable items and start putting together some basic survival tools such as a grill and a water purifier. Soon you will be expanding the size of your raft using the wood and plastic that you find floating around, giving you more real estate to put more items such as crop plots for growing food, grass plots for feeding animals, and storage boxes to hold all of your inventory. 

One of the best things about this game is being able to play with your friends on the same raft. If you are happy to play single player, you do have the option of pausing the game, which gives you time to stop the hunger and thirst meters and let you do some out of game research such as working out how to kill certain enemies or build certain tools. In multiplayer though, you won’t have this luxury, so keep this in mind when starting up a multiplayer game. 

Even the developers of this indie game did not expect to see the success that it did. After featuring on some big Youtubers’ channels, the game has sold surprisingly well, and in May 2018 it launched in Steam early access with nearly 19,000 concurrent players! Although the number has dropped, it has consistently had a healthy player base and currently sports around 4,500 average concurrent players according to Steamcharts. The studio has since added more staff, expanding on its initial start from a group of University friends. The future of the game looks bright too, as they have recently started adding expansions called Chapters, which bring something extra to the table. The chapters are basically story based campaign missions, which introduce some to the players some lore, new items, new animals, and of course new challenges, such as parkour-based platform game elements. 

If you enjoy survival games that you the options of crafting, building, fighting and exploration, you will very likely enjoy this game, and considering it is mostly spent out in the ocean it is also unique among the others, it definitely does bring a unique setting to the table."
23778,really cool game in general like it alot
23779,"THIS GAME IS AWESOME!!! Quick note: I recommend playing this with a friend so it's faster and easier. Playing alone is fine, but it's kinda slower when exploring all the important points of the game. can't wait for chapter 3!! if you have read this after chapter 3 has came out, then I can't wait for the next chapter!!"
23780,This is good.
23781,I like it
23782,"After a long time, after a long support from the developers - the game is extremely transformed. Although, to be honest, there was not much hope. Most importantly, the updates continue to come, which means that the developers still want to support their game) Thank them for that) Because the game is really good!"
23783,Great game to play solo or Co-op!
23784,"This game is something else. With boring worldbuilding, and what can only be described as a dumpsterfire of a story, Raft puts little effort into its storytelling, leaving you with little more than notes to read to tie together loosely based narrations and plotlines. There is little thought put into making the story actually interesting, as the lore-locations are little more than a mish-mash of some characters we never see, having problems we as players can't relate to. 

Combat is a completely new can of worms in this game. With little in the way of weapon diversity, and no real way of damage indication, you're forced to pretty much brute-force your way through this games boring combat mechanic. With buggy hitboxes and awful enemy design, it leaves a lot to be desired. Most enemies come well stacked with leap attacks if you so happen to get far enough away from them, meaning that outrunning them is almost always impossible. And if two so happen to find you at the same time, you're as good as dead as kiting two bears at once is not a viable strat, with the only escape being to glitch yourself on a cliff and hope their pathfinding bugs out. There is nothing more to combat than kiting, and predicting enemy attacks as you step in for a white while they wind up their animation. There is little fun, there is no strategy, just mindless back and fourth until the enemy is dead.

The raft itself is a neat, modular mechanic, leaving much to be desired. With little in the ways of upgrading, it leaves you wondering why there aren't more options as you can fully deck out your raft in a few hours. 

This is a fun game to play with friends, but at this point, it's not a valid excuse for bad game-design, horrible storytelling, and a combat system that does not match the survival aspect. If you plan on playing with friends, get this game, but as a solo experience, it's not worth the money."

23804,"You should definitely buy this game (while on sale), I was skeptical of it at first thinking there isn't much it has too offer, and while that may be true at times, seeing as island layout can be copy and pasted, the game is very enjoyable and there is a lot of stuff to craft and use. There is a lot of grind, but its a fun grind, the type of grind that makes you lose track of time when playing with a friend."

23829,"Horrible game mechanics.

The durability of tools is insane. Every single tool destroys itself after only a few uses, so you have to constantly re-craft things. I only needed an hour or so in the game before realizing that situation was going to be unbearable in the long run. 

Same for food and water. Nothing you eat or drink provides very much, and then to double down on that problem the sustenance they provide runs out in a few minutes, so you're double screwed.

The shark is dumb. What kind of a shark attacks a boat?! A Steven Spielberg shark...

This has to be the worst survival/builder game I have ever played. Started a couple games on normal and in both of the starts promptly ended up with my raft stuck against an island. No paddles, or sails could free them. The only solution was to start over. 

Take note of just how little playtime any of the reviewers have on this game. Of even the positive reviews, clearly no one likes it very much; at least not enough to actually play it."

I've never seen such a unfinished and bad game like this (I know its in early acces but the game is now out 4 years and its still in early acces). I wasted my time so hard playing this shit. Buy it if you hate your life and want to waste your time. (btw i played it because my friend wanted it, so i had to)"

23850,very fun
23851,

23853,VERY GOOD GAME BUT NEED MORE UPDATE ASAP
23854,very good
23855,very fun to play with friends
23856,"Would really reccomend this game if you have friends to play with! it is fun alone but it gets boring really fast if you dont have anyone to play with. 
If you are okay with playing survival games alone I would buy it but if not, you should get your friends to buy it too so you have someone to play with. 
The shark is fucking annoying in the beginning btw."
23857,good game
23858,"All the makings of a great game, missing some really basic features and with some bad design decisions. 

Can't change the gamemode (difficulty) after starting without a mod. Sometimes I want a challenge, sometimes I want to be left in peace, and I don't want to start two different saves to do it. Let me play how I want.

No option to unstick your raft when it clips into something and gets stuck, the unstick button only works on the character. This has happened twice, and once I had to deconstruct basically my whole raft to get it to unclip from what it was stuck in.

The animals are just...irritating. Not challenging, not interesting, not fun. The shark is actually fairly well balanced, but the other animals are just a drag and make me want to shut the game off and go play something else.

It's not a bad game, but there are so many little niggles like this that I never end up playing for more than an hour at a time before something frustrates me and I go to play something better. And that's a shame. Because the concept is amazing."
23859,AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH
23860,"It's really fun when u have friends to play with, I recommend to play this with a beefy computer tho."
23861,I gotta raft
23862,Its not Valorant.
23863,"Raft is a very beautiful game, and you can have a better experience if played with a few friends. 
The music, grapichs and world grant you a peaceful moment during the day. 
The story behind the game is also very intriguing with notes to discover in each location. 
It's very simple to play and this semplicity add value to the relaxing part of the game, you will not have to struggle for a specific crafting or during exploration.
Overall i advice to play Raft, as i already said, with some friends to enjoy the game in the best way possible.

23887,"this game is amazing me and my dad play it together all day everyday i recomend this game to everyone in the world
"
23888,"Fun game, just i encountered a bug where the junk in the ocean just stopped spawning,. I looked it up and it says that for the loot to come back i need to head in the right direction. So I put up my sail and the loot camp back. Only problem was that I was heading away from the blue dot on my receiver. Now I cant play that world.

So I fixed itself, I just let the raft flow and I ended up getting close to my next location. Also I finished the game, its really fun can't wait for Chapter 3. 

Also one thing I would fix is make the put the notes somewhere more noticeable because I spend an extra hour trying to find one note in Carivan Town and I can't find one note in the final dome city monument.

Besides that one of the best games I have ever played"

23921,"It's a fun game, more so with friends. But you need a pretty good graphics card if you want it to look right, and a pretty good PC  in general. Unless you don't mind a little (or a lot) of lag. You can fix it mostly by running everything on low quality, but it's not the same. Still, if you have what it needs, it's pretty fun."
23922,its good
23923,i think that this is a good game because you start out with no clue then get realy good all kinds of story locations and the biulding is good to!
23924,yes very good game
23925,"I recently bought raft and I am currently playing it with 2 friends, I really like the survival genre and this game does it very well.  It is kind of hard to get started but once you get rolling it is a really fun game to play. If it is going to be your first time playing I recommend playing on peaceful mode until you get used to the mechanics of the game and the basics of surviving on the Ocean. 

  One helpful tip I have is always have an anchor crafted cause you never know when you might see an island or some other point of interest that you would want to stop at during the first part of the game. Also try to unlock medium crop plots as soon as you can because you can replant the potatoes and beets you get for a fairly reliable food supply to start out with.  Also if your raft drifts to far away from you the island you are on will despawn if that happens you can press the Escape key and use the unstuck button and it should teleport you back to your raft."

Although I know that saying sorry to those of you who are reading my comment will not change the fact that I fail miserably to write and speak perfect English, I am writing this as a way to deter a certain type of people who cannot stand poor English (Also known informally as ""Grammar Nazis"") from mocking me by posting unwanted and unnecessary comments detailing my every blunder. In my humble opinion, making grammatical errors should be perfectly acceptable as native speakers should not expect non-native speakers to be able to communicate in their second or third languages eloquently. If you are able to completely understand what the other person wrote, is there really a problem with what they've written? No, because the entire concept of communication is the exchange of information between other intelligent beings, which means that no matter how the exchange of information is made, as long as the information is accurately shared there is not a fundamental issue with their ability to communicate. To see it in another way, remember that someone who isn't fluent in English is fluent in another language. When you think about it this way, isn't it impressive for someone to speak a second language in any capacity? Having empathy and respect are qualities that are sorely missing for far too many people these days, especially on the internet.

That being said, I am aware that not all netizens who correct others are doing it to ridicule and shame. There are some who do so with the intent to help others improve and grow. However, displaying the failures of other people publicly will cause the person who is criticized to feel negative emotions such as shame and sadness due to the fact that their mistake has been made obvious which severely undermines the point they were trying to make in spite of their unfamiliarity with the English language. In most circumstances people are not looking for language help when they post anything online. Most people just want to enjoy themselves and have a good time on the internet which is why I would not encourage correcting other people regardless of your intentions. If you really do want to help others with their spelling or grammar, I would highly recommend you to help via messaging privately because not only will you not embarrass anyone, you can also go more in-depth with your explanation which I'm sure the other person will greatly appreciate if they want help, but I digress. I know that I've written a bit of an essay, but I hope I've made my points clear. Anyways, here is the comment I wanted to make:

cool game


(I received additional compensation for the review of this game)"
23944,good
23945,:)
23946,its game
23947,fun

23952,a lovely game
23953,relaxing
23954,good times with the homies
23955,"this game was fun at first, but then the multiplayer lag and bugs and everything else about this buggy ass game ruined my love for this game 1/5 stars"
23956,Seagulls are tasty.
23957,Interesting concept and fun. Can get cucked very easily from the start but that's the fun. Don't die.
23958,good game
23959,"Most relaxing game on steam, so chill to drift aroud and explore."
23960,"Only played for 8 hours and I couldnt stop pointing out all the little details that they thought of that sadly many gamedevs wouldnt do.. Seems like a fairly thought through game that feels nice to play, intuitive and fluent to play, not some clunky mess that is frustrating to operate.
Great game, very fun with friends (dont know about solo).

Highly recommending esp. for the price."
23961,"very gud game. *IF YOU HAD A FRIENDS"" That can carried you to play this game lol,  *emote batu"
23962,this game is cool if you like to be on a raft :)
23963,A Very Very good game to play with friend
23964,i like the physicks and the survival like its so cool playing with friends
23965,"you can build in creative mode without gathering surplies and dying 
"
23966,Great Game
23967,"FUN GAME WITH FRIENDS
"
23968,yes
23969,S'good
23970,Early access game still giving the best gameplay damn.. Loved how game updated throughout the years.
23971,Good game. If im being honest its only fun playing with friends so first you have to convince them to play and second make sure they actually know to play the game. When you get to the storyline it gets pretty interesting. but the best part of this game is getting to decorate the boat but in order to decorate you have to get materials so thats kinda annoying. overall good game (only with friends)
23972,my balls!!!!!
23973,it gud
23974,yes
23975,good
23976,"Best game yet, hope they put some effort to ScrapMechanic too"

23985,"gas

23986,e
23987,Not worth it. needs work. Boring. Using a hook to grab building supplies is terrible. Couldn't stay on to even try the first island. The hook is annoying to use. I spent $13 on it. I'm going to try to return it.
23988,only downside is you cant f*ck other players
23989,really fun an challenging
23990,get gud scub
23991,yes mhm raft
23992,i like it it tackes you on a anvecher you have to find stoff theat hellp you servie
23993,fun with friends
23994,poggers
23995,this game is asome thank you for creating this game
23996,very gud
23997,Its a good game but I cant play with my friend who pirated it which is dumb.
23998,"It very relaxing, but tedious."
23999,"Great game, I love floating around just building my raft while f***ing up the shark. only thing I will say is, wood is used for absolutely everything, so you may gather a lot of it, but its never enough. I also find that there isn't enough plastic for the amount you use it.

Overall great game, and I love spending hours at a time playing"
24000,"I highly recommend Raft.

Raft is a very fun game that is kind of short but that does not mean it's a bad game by any means it is one of the best games i have ever played!

I find the best part of this game in my opinion is playing with friends its much more fun"
24001,can't even swin for long without getting bit by a shark why even add water if you cannot go in it dumb.
24002,very gud game
24003,"Stupid fun with friends. How much you need to eat and drink needs to be adjusted significantly. Anxiously awaiting update 3 anyway
"
24004,really fun with freinds
24005,Amazing game.
24006,"Raft is a survival game, much like other where you find resources and build equipment, tools, and other useful contraptions. It is also possible to craft different furnitures and cosmetic items which do not provide much usefullness beside making your base look better. The game consists of sailing/drifting through the ocean while collecting resoruces and maintaining survival needs such as thirst and hunger. While sailing through the ocean you will meet different islands which hold different resources and purposes. 

The game is extremely fun to play even though it is still in early access, and provides tons of fun content to experience, especially with friends. This game being early access, it obviously has weak points, but non are game breaking, and are generally just missing QoL or other small stuff, which I am certain will be fixed by full release.

Have a nice trip, enjoy the ride and beware the mighty shark!"
24007,"I love this game! good grafics, great updates, etc. would definitly recommend!"
24008,iT IS A FUN ADVENTURE GAME
24009,I like everything about this game and I hope you make more like this one.
24010,relaxing but shark scary
24011,"For me this game is pure escapism. I've wanted a sailing game, like Sea of Thieves, but with unlimited sailing, which Raft gives me. There is the slight pressures of surviving, the need for food and water, etc. I love the crafting system, the way that you learn things feel very natural, unlike other survival games that gives you blueprints out of a book to meet the requirements, here, in Raft, it requires curiosity to unlock recipes for crafting.

There are slight annoyances. 
Edit... I found out that this game can be modded. It now is almost perfect. The devs just need to finish the game now.

TLDR, love the game. It's not perfect, but it's close to perfect."
24012,yeah
24013,Great Game
24014,I think this is my favorite survival game.
24015,"HDHEHEHEHEHHEHEEHG WQAAFRSDHBGKCM LSFDMG,JHNBCLKH,SEAZTDGBIOKUJH XBVMNC"
24016,"It is a fun game. At first it can be a bit annoying to gather resources while at the same time keeping up on food and water, but hey that's the fun in the game is its not super easy when you start off. Once you understand it though it really does become a fun game to play, you can literally just sit back and relax and grind out materials and have fun with friends. But there is much more I could say about the game but i gotta get back on and grind out materials. I have a very high opinion of this game and not really anything bad to say but i would highly recommend a play through with your friends!!!"
24017,cheeks
24018,boat
24019,I love swimming on my boat
24020,"nut up or shut up 
"
24021,muy bien. me gusta rafto mucha. raft es muy divertido con mis amigas. 10/10
24022,"Nice chill survival, more fun in co-op!"
24023,with your friends its relly good
24024,IT IS SO FUN BUT SOME PARTS ARE TRICKY ITS SO FUN IVE BEEN PALYING FOR 22 HOURS IT WAS SO FUN!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
24025,"yes it is a very good game
"
24026,i like it cuase you build and its fun
24027,MATTY CALLED OUR SHARK RETARDED RICHARD
24028,"Raft is really fun to play with friends, there is a lot to do just playing by yourself, there is a really fun creative menu and single-player. BUT its infinitely better with friends. I only have one problem with the game. There isn't a tutorial!! you just spawn on a raft with a fishing hook and nothing else. It dose not tell you what to do. no hints. no clues. no anything. I know some people like that kind of game but its really just frustrating not knowing what to do. So in raft there is somewhat of a story mode to it, so you might get a set of cords, you go to that place and you can learn how to make Jets or whatever. Really its the navigation that really bugs me. You don't really know what to do, your just given a computer later on in the game and you have to punch in a set of coordinates and use a radar to get there. That sounds simple but its so annoying to figure out. I just wish there was some sort of guild or help. Other than that its a really good game 8/10 would recommend"
24029,This game is a very fun game where you can just build freely and explore. I highly recommend this game to an ordinary person. I would play it 10 more times 10/10 Very Good!
24030,"good
"
24031,I LOVED RTHIS GAME
24032,really fun but once you beat the story line theres not much too do besides build up your raft but overall its very worth
24033,"i love it :)
"
24034,balls
24035,fun
24036,I am a casual gamer and this game is great for someone like me. I'll play this game for a long time!
24037,fun game and progression isnt too fast or too slow
24038,"it gud gam
"
24039,good game
24040,"At first look, this style of game seems boring to most but it's quite fun, addicting almost."
24041,"Enjoyable! I do recommend just playing without watching any tutorials, it's much more fun to figure the game out by yourself/ with friends :^)"
24042,generally cracked game. Best played with friends!!
24043,its fun
24044,very fun very nice
24045,PLZ PLAY VERY GOOG GAME!!!!!!!!!!!
24046,i like that i killed a shark by my self
24047,"One of the best story line games, they need to add some DLC's for story extension"
24048,cool game. i do wish there was more islands....
24049,"need more achievements
"
24050,"The is very fun but grindy, s o if you have time and patience then this is the game for you"
24051,Apenas gostei de jogar com amigos sem é muito chato!!!
24052,fun fun good
24053,Ho2.
24054,"it will teach you life lesons
"
24055,BOAT
24056,"went to this massive island with my friend, raft stranded away and we had to swim to islands, 10/10"
24057,"It's an enjoyable game with a lot of great aspects, mainly the freedom it gives you. The graphics are good, although for lower end computers it may be struggle, and I haven't found a single bug in my time playing. The story is a bit predictable, but enjoyable. Updates have taken a while to release, so it may be a bit boring in that in-between time, but the game is developed by a small team. Overall, a great game with lots to explore and a relatively enjoyable quest/story line."
24058,nice game
24059,gud
24060,"Best in multiplayer, but a really enjoyable game overall, even as single player. I can't wait for the next updates!"
24061,calming when not struggling to live pretty fun though cannot wait til theres alot more to it !
24062,very yes
24063,I liked the games focus on exploration but the speed of the raft can sometimes be frustrating
24064,"VERY GOOD GAME
"
24065,This is fun and addicting. free reign on how you can build your own raft and set up your base.
24066,"good game
"
24067,"Really fun! 

... surprisingly addictive"
24068,"This game is really good. Easily one on the best indies I've played. If you're considering whether or not to buy this, I can tell you please do. I don't think I've gotten more fun from any other $20 game I've ever played tbh."
24069,Excellent
24070,This is a wonderful pass time game.   I play this and become so relaxed!  It's one of my favorite games.
24071,sharko
24072,"НЕТ ДИМОН ОНА НЕ СДОХЛА ОНА НЕ СДОХЛА
"
24073,SO ADDICTING!
24074,"I love this game, if you like minecraft or dont starve together you will enjoy this game a million times more! love the mechanics and lore as well as the multiplay. Actually made it fun to be stranded in an ocean!"
24075,This game is super fun
24076,"You should change the shark mechanic. Jaws did enough to turn public opinion against sharks, why do you need them to instantly turn and home in on the player anytime they're in the water? Also, we're covering miles of sea but it's the same shark every time unless you kill it? That's not how sharks work...that's you being bad at a gameplay loop. It'd be better if there was more to the shark/human interaction. Your boars and birds are also lacking in substance...fix it."
24077,"When it went on sale for $10 It's a really fun peaceful game with a not bad story got 10.9 hrs currently and a lot still to go,probably wouldn't pay more than $25 but anything under is worth it if you enjoy games like this,Green Hell,Subnautica or Sea Of Thieves. The game is also still in ""early access"" so some new shit will probably be added. (Also Bruce the shark is a prick)"
24078,"Such a great Co-op survival game. Had to use Wiki a couple of times to understand some stuff but overall the game wasn't that hard to understand, I love how it was released on 2018 but still gets updates till now and I can't wait for chapter 3 to come out. If you were either a survival games fan or not you should really give this one a try."
24079,"the most fun you can have wet.
One of the greatest co-op experiences with friends. 
Building is fun, exploring is the core of the game, super chill vibes."
24080,Perfect casual survivor game!
24081,Not a sensitive person nor do i ever get nauseous but man 1 hour into this game and it got me good.
24082,haha hook [i]schloop[/i].
24083,GOOD GAME!
24084,hot sharks
24085,good game with friends

24105,Terrible game. The original free game was so much better. regret the money spent!
24106,"Super fun, and packed full of adventure. I recommend this game to others because it helps learn about the dangers in the wild, and ultimately how to survive in the wild."
24107,love the game
24108,so dope
24109,",
"
24110,"This games really rewarding and well designed. Sound, game-play, enemies, story, its great! But your friends are gonna get you killed, and that's okay, just don't give them any water bottles as punishment."
24111,"peaceful but also stressful, you have to constantly watch your hunger and thirst whilst making sure the shark doesn't eat your collection net. also if u go on an island you have to wait for your crops to fully grow or else mike and his other seagull friends would eat them. but when it is still water and you're on full thirst and hunger fishing. it is very relaxing :)"
24112,"My only problem for now is lack of long term play, but for its price you get a really good experience."
24113,Great game trust me please play this game haters get ou of here welcome to all the new players
24114,ok
24115,"This game is very relaxing and amazing to play with friends. If you don't like grinding games, this might not work out for you. It's fun to play by yourself it's just a lot of grinding. 

:)"

24132,Raft is a great game! It is so fun and I would buy it if I were you.
24133,"[h1]That's an amazing game with huge potential.[/h1] Even when I played this game for 120 hours, it did'n get bored, 'cause the game is multiplayer and if u don't have a friend who wanna play Raft, u can always find him in [url=https://discord.gg/raft] Raft's discord server[/url]. And it's cool that the Redbeet keep in touch with the players and periodically publish new dev blogs). This game has a great plot, but for me, it's one of the best sandboxes. So I'm still waiting for new updates and [b]chapter 3[/b]))."
24134,"very fun exept the annoying shark lol
"
24135,good game
24136,Can't join friends lobby glitch
24137,10/10 Can claim animals as my own and go swimming with them - also like there's an interesting story off in the corner and building mechanics are fun
24138,This game is so engaging especially with friends there's so many things to discover and build. Also being able to see the various sea creature is amazing.
24139,meh
24140,Overall it's a good game
24141,This game is BRILLIANT
24142,Bread!
24143,I like to play this with my bb
24144,Super Fun!
24145,fun
24146,"While the beginning of the game/learning period can be rough for single and two player runs can be touch, this game is addictive and fun. I've restarted my run of Raft about 3/4 times, just for the experience. This game, while still in development, proves that one can be lost in the experience and enjoy time and time again. With the new chapters being added, new lore, new items, new mechanics, and developing stories adds to the fun. As someone who loves to grind for supplies, I play this game to relax after a long overnight shift. Please take the time to enjoy and learn the game."
24147,Very fun getting attacked by a  huge ass bear
24148,"This game is really fun with friends.
10/10 would recomend"
24149,"good game

24150,got me closer to one of my friends and now we've been dating for 3 months. thank you for the enjoyable experience ;)))
24151,"great game 4/5

24152,Fuck cant open at all Game Crash
24153,CC
24154,Love the game so far...needs more content though!
24155,cool survival game
24156,"The game is great, no thanks to the f****** shark. Really excited for the sex update that someone in the reviews mentioned."
24157,"Really fun game, have yet to play with friends because it is hard to find people that play this game in my friend group, but still pretty relaxing to play solo"
24158,"I would recommend this game to other players.

Pros:
- Has a little story you can get into that introduces unique islands and moderate challenges.
- You can build, decorate and paint your raft any way you want. Make it big or small.
- Lots of things to grow and cook.
- It's a fun concept and can keep you busy for hours.
- Has lots of things to craft and a few nice things to find like a captain's hat.

Cons:
- The islands start to look the same after a while (not including the Story Islands which there aren't enough of in my opinion). Not enough variety in islands. Too much similarity. 
- You can't customize your character at all. For a game that allows so much freedom to decorate and customize your raft, having a pre-made character seems at odds with the spirit of the game.
- Story is too short. 
- The sea water goes over the raft too much. A raft would sink with that much water washing over it. Good thing you can build it into more a boat if you get creative.
- Tools/weapons/equipment break too quickly. Is everything made of marshmallow? Why do bowls disappear after one use?

Overall, I enjoy the game and am looking forward to updates. I just hope the development updates don't take too long."
24159,yes
24160,this game sucks price is not worth it
24161,Raft is a great game if you want to spend some quality time with a couple mates. Endgame can easily be reached within 2 hrs of ingame fun. My reccomendation is to spend the first couple hours on easy learning the game and then move to normal or hard if you feel you are ready. Good game 8/10.
24162,very funny game and creative
24163,"fun with friends (very fun)
"
24164,is good game
24165,hurt my toe :(
24166,Raft is fun. You should play it.  You might have fun.  I had fun. You could too.
24167,it gets pretty laggy and choppy but its mostly smooth
24168,"I love good survival games, but this one does not feel very well balanced around a single player experience. The resource costs of even early/mid game stuff is super high, and even expanding the raft itself is rather expensive.  Ultimately I think its a really fun premise that seems like it'd be fun to play with friends, but as a single player experience its extremely tedious and lacking."
24169,balls
24170,I PLAYED FOR 1 HOUR I HATED IT MY MOM CALLED ME AND I WASNT ABLE TO TURN OFF MY PC AND I CANT REFUND I DONT RECOMMEND
24171,"Love playing this game with my friend. 80 days in, and going strong, always something to do, and never gets stale. 10/10 would recommend."
24172,Its fun
24173,"Good Game, Like shark because murder."
24174,vary fun
24175,Fun to play + Grind = Raft
24176,Very nice

24178,it good

24180,it is a raft
24181,Grinded game for a full weekend with 2 friends and managed to finish the game was a bit bummed it was short but we are real gamers! Can't wait to see the next update :)
24182,"This is a great survival game. Good graphics, fun. The only problem I have with it, is that it is really hard to get somewhere in the game. It's worth the money."
24183,"This is a very good game, but there are a few things to note. There are some visual glitches, like the fishing rod. It glitches a lot when you reel back in, water some time glitches around and the sky sometimes flickers when you look directly up once in awhile, but these aren't game breaking bugs nor do they ruin the experience. But maybe there is one bug left that I found that needs to be fixed. Sometimes when you pause, the game does not pause, and the game still keeps moving even tho I hit ""pause"" in the game menu. Kind of annoying, but you can just save and leave the main menu and I guess it works. I also had a little trouble getting the game to have a decent fps as it was locked at 30 fps, but the issue had to do with the GPU, and it was an easy fix.  Aside from that, the game play is great! Hopefully there are more updates soon!"
24184,so much fun but really glitchy
24185,good game
24186,"Good game, well played, seagulls ate my woramallon"
24187,Good Story. Hilarious with friends. The shark hates you

24209,good gaem
24210,"Great game! Got a buddy to pick it up and having a lot of fun. Customization of the raft is great, challenge is scaleable, artwork is well done. In my first 30 hours, I only had one glitch with a box remaining open after closing out, then becoming inaccessible.  I was able to go to the main menu and come back in, fixing the problem. For an early access game, this one is incredibly well done. My only critique for this game would be either building some procedural generation of islands so you don't do the same island back to back or add a greater variety."
24211,fun with people ...
24212,its pretty fun
24213,yes

24229,"I started out playing this game on easy mode and it gave me some anxiety--the ocean is dark and deep, the shark has no mercy and smiles at you creepily, and if you fall into the water, it takes a moment to jump back up again onto your raft if you don't time it well. 

But then, I tried peaceful mode. Other than accidentally jumping into the water one time and landing face to face with the shark, it was much better. I could just build and build and build, and my raft is glorious. 

I will admit that jumping up to the top level of the radio tower was pretty challenging, and each of the locations presented a different 'issue' (e.g. scary, dark, easy to get lost in), but I am learning to handle this the Dark Souls-way. Just die and respawn.

I'm enjoying the game and I hope that the new locations will be released quickly. I hope that this game goes the Terraria-route, in the sense that it never really quite has to end."

24248,VERY FUN WITH FRIENDS
24249,"Very enjoyable. There are a few glitches like when you drop things and can't pick them back up and a few animals literally just freezing in place and becoming invulnerable but otherwise I quite enjoy the game. It's very free on the creativity, allows for multiplayer, and allows you to choose the difficulty so you can enjoy building survival without the murder creatures or you can go full hard mode and really try to live. Either way, I would recommend this game to others if you are looking for something with a bit of minecraft/sea of thieves kind of feel to it."

I bought a copy for my husband and I each to play together, we both have really enjoyed playing.  I find the music and water to be very soothing.  I was worried the game would feel like I am grinding out tasks, but I have NOT had that experience.  I enjoy the building and crafting side of things, and I am happy that I haven't had to look a lot of stuff up in this aspect."

24300,"[h1]7/10[/h1]

Without this game being finished yet, I have already had so much fun playing it. 31 hours of fun at this point in time. With that being said here's some improvements I would like to see:
[list]
[*]Some deeper tutorial as to how to do things. I found myself having to check the wiki all the time.
[*]A way to make seeds out of crops. Maybe simply crafting or maybe some kind of juicing machine that would give me seeds and a little bit of juice.
[*]Voice-over option for the notes. Too much text I didn't read and maybe should have. (This one is being worked on I believe, or at the very least text is being revised.)
[*]More building options. I would love to see glass windows that are double the size of the ones in game so that I can actually look out of the window from some distance.
[*]More clothing options and characters. When playing with multiple people it's a little confusing to have everyone look the same. (Also being worked on)
[*]In my personal opinion the waves get too high, my whole raft gets flooded (only visually) and I can't catch fish because the fishing line gets disconnected.
[*]Steam workshop would me much appreciated. People could make custom photos and furniture for the game."

"
24351,"Single-Player Experience: 4/10
Multi-Player Experience: 9.5/10

Trying the game in single-player, I found the experience to be very fun for about 2 hours. After that, everything feels extremely tedious. I never have enough time to do every task. I always have to choose a task at the detriment of not being able to do others.

In multiplayer, everyone does a different job. You don't have to juggle your hot bar because only one player needs smelting ingredients on their bar, another player with food ingredients, and so on. You end up with a surplus of food and resources and a lot more freedom to explore.

This is a tremendously great multiplayer game.

Music - 5/5

Graphics - 5/5
(Simple style but it works really well for this game)

User Interface - 5/5

Combat Mechanics - 3/5
(Simple combat system but it's somewhat enjoyable.)

Storyline - 5/5
(Only half way through the story so far but loving the journal and notes system.)

Resource Management - 3/5
(There is no auto-deposit, making it rather annoying to deposit resources into chests. Game wants to feel realistic though, I get that.)"
24352,"Unexpected plot line, at first I thought that it would just be a normal survival sandbox game like Minecraft, but was pleasantly surprised by humor, story, lore. and more.

24390,its very artistic and fun
24391,"Fun and relaxing... Even though you have to survive while being stranded in Oceanic conditions foraging for garbage along the currents of water you travel; not to mention having to fight off Shiela the shark every 5 to 10 minutes. Other then that it's completely relaxing... Did I mention the hostile wild life on deserted islands. And constantly starving because your person doesn't have the ability to be satiated by food or water for more then a few minutes at a time unless you cook random recipes later in the game play. By the time your are done your meager raft will be a full on cruise liner for one occupant and all of Noahs animals on your Ark. 

Hope you enjoy the vastness of the game and don't rush it, it's supposed to an adventure."

24401,"EDIT: The games OST is so good, I turn this review into positive, instead of leaving a negative butthurt one. Because even with the issues, it is worth the money, just for the OST, lol.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m2P5t8UZz6o

-Well, this games description and videos are very misleading.

Seems like a relaxíng survival, while in fact its more pressing than ark, conan, 7days to die, night of dead, icarus, green hell, stranded deep, and so on.

First, it lacks a stupidly basic pause function. No excuse for this, a mod was needed so escape menu does at least stop hunger and thirst.

Second, it has a very silly and forced rogue lite - ironman mode. Even games with zombies let you choose if you wanna drop loot on death. Not everybody can nolife this game.

The reason is simple, without forced ironman (no saves) and rogue lite mechanic (you dont even drop loot on death, you simply lose all inventory and hotbar, lol) the game would be trivial very fast, cause if you are not forced to start from scratch, in 5-10hh you can build enough so all the survival aspects are trivial.

So instead of a good and balanced learning and progression curve, they removed the ability to load a previous save, and force you to lose everything on death, to artificially lengthen the game.

Price is good at discount, content seems decent, but itsfar from a relaxing game. Remember, you cant even pause.

Save and exit to menu every time you do anything outside the game, dont even scratch your head, in 3s you can be dead and forced to start over."

24418,"Fun game to play with friends or alone, has cool crafting possibilities, interesting well thought out lore for my fellow lore lovers, a vibrant charming art style, and devs have been releasing consistent updates."
24419,"So, I really enjoyed this game...at first. I'm a big fan of survival games, I loved the fact it was a multiplayer, and I enjoyed the fact that it had a story to be followed. I played on Normal, the average style with my husband, who is also a fan of survival games. However, there are some MAJOR flaws in this game. Every noon and midnight the waves become so bad it's easier to just jump off the raft to gather supplies, because the waves make it impossible to hook anything at these times. The hunger and thirst meters fall incredibly rapidly, more so than any normal person would ever need to consume without physically rowing a raft (you can get the sail pretty early on and the wind always seems to blow in the direction you want to go which is nice). And you lose your entire inventory if all players are incapacitated, which is pretty easy to do if you stumble along an area you aren't ready for, i.e. a bear, acid pit, or the shark attack while scavenging. I would have been able to look past the crazy waves and ridiculous thirst and hunger, but the entire loss of inventory with no way of getting it back is just too much. Perhaps two people are just not enough, so if you have a group of three or more, and can look past the other flaws, get the game. I'll probably not touch the game again unless we can get a friend to play along.
EDIT: Found a friend and switched it to EASY mode like a Noob. Still agree with the above statements, I feel like I should be able to play a game on NORMAL. However, I can't, in good conscience, give it a NOT RECOMMENDED review seeing how many hours I've poured into the game. It has been fun, and the updated lore/plot is intriguing. EASY mode makes the thirst and hunger levels a reasonable challenge."

What I have issues with is how you can find an island that has over a hundred trees on it but only a handful are able to be chopped down for resources. Also the resource consumption for a standard fishing rod is too high as are a few other items. Playing on Normal causes overuse of food and water. You end up incapacitated way too fast."

24471,is fun
24472,Cool game that keeps getting added to.  Lots of fun especially when playing with other people. The controls/Picking up stuff and opening the inventory take a little bit of getting used to but after playing for a while you get used to it. Great Game over all.
24473,"NOTE: This is not my first time playing, but my first time in a long time

I had high hopes for this game, but they fell short. As somebody who plays most games alone, I found this game very boring and it has a lack of much to do by yourself. I have not tried to do so, but I am very sure you will enjoy this game with friends. 
Ill recommend this game only if you don't play solo"
24474,A pretty peaceful game and super fun to play with friends. So many things to do and craft.

24488,Nice
24489,"I'm very happy with the game. Building your Raft with various resources is the main point of interest for me and it is really great. There is a lot of stuff to research and unlock and if you follow the main story, it happens decently fast, so you can access everything (even if you probably can't craft high quantities yet) and plan and build everything relatively early and don't have to grind for like a dozen hours. The combat is simple but clear. Enemy and location variety is alright, although I expect more to come as the game progresses through early access. The music is just very nicely fitting overall. Really looking forward to future updates!"

24491,"good stuff, relaxing if you can get used to a shark constantly hovering over you. islands cool, interesting puzzles for the story good teamwork co-op game. harder solo"

24494,The game loop is a lot of fun and it is just a good time overall. Looking forward to future content

24505,Make it so you can egt tokens from scrap or anything because the game is boaring as shit if you cant get more
24506,"Raft good, more content please."
24507,This game is very relaxing and has a niche story with some puzzles. Great to play with friends.
24508,👍
24509,"There's something about collecting and organizing all of the trash in the ocean that speaks to me. Feels like conservation... Also, it's a fun romp with a good story and the devs are good about listening to what the players want. With each new update, they add mechanics that not only further the story but also improve the QOL for players."
24510,"love this game

24511,best game ever

24513,As a survival games fan I enjoyed every second of it. Waiting for the new episodes to come!
24514,The storyline additions are great!
24515,"this game is so addictive its unbelivable. The game is even more fun with friends, i highly reccomend this game if your thinking of getting it."
24516,cool
24517,this game is boring asf and i didnt get a refund so im mad
24518,"A very good game with friends.
I don't have any friends but had very much fun.
Recommend."
24519,"Honestly I don't get all the positive reviews. I understand that there is more to this game than I got to, but the pace is glacial, the stuff you can build is totally unimpressive, gathering resources is a really *miserable* grind, there are only a handful of enemies, the graphics are generally awful (I'm all ""Ultra"" on every setting)... Except for its premise this game has nothing to recommend it. For all my play sessions I felt like I was playing ""Adventure!"" on the Atari -- and that's not a compliment.

Maybe this is a development team of 2 to 4 people, in which case, it is a decent debut. But you can skip this, really."

24535,a shark ate my son and then bought me a beer
24536,I made a previous review about how slow and boring the game was and how the shark was more annoying then an actual issue but i played the game with a friend and i can most certainly say this game is extremely fun with people you enjoy being with i was played with 3 people including me and we each had jobs i was builder/resource guy one friend defended the base and got animals and the other made sure we were sailing the right way but you can just goof around and have some fun or maybe make a arena of death to fight your friends to death when you guys have a slight disagreement to decide what to do.
24537,Raft is a good game to play solo and with friends i suggest this game if you would like to have a calm experience with your friends. If not have fun (:

24541,"[h1]Information[/h1]
I am Mone. I enjoy open-world creative construction games, or sandbox, as Steam likes to call it.
[h1]Creativity[/h1]
I find this game to be very creative, and I mean this in two ways. First, the [b]developers[/b] were very creative for creating this game, and giving it such a story. And, in the sense that players can be so creative with how they play their game. With so many modes, and customization options, this is definitely great for creative people.
[h1]Design[/h1]
The design to this game is so wonderful. So much effort appears to be put in to the textures, I can't just help but be inspired by such greatness, I really hope that other games will go for the extra work to make textures flawless as well. I also love the UI and GUI. It's so matching to the theme, and it doesn't skip a beat on the clearness.
[h1]Mood & Feeling[/h1]
This game has a lonely feel to it. And it's so vast that I can't help but wonder how far it truly goes. I really like the moods that can be setup to give the user a more comfortable feel with all the designs they can make.
[h1]Overall Rating[/h1]
I have to admit that this game is absolutely amazing, I have so much built, and I feel as though I can expand to a great amazing city of some sort, but also this game just feels so comforting to be in.

The story is very intriguing though, they're slowly adding in the chapters so it's not all there yet, but I'm looking forwards to see where it goes.

Great game that I hate to play. 6/10.

Better with friends!"

24642,"Absolutely love this game. The story is interesting and they keep updating the content. Some people say there's nothing to do after you complete the story line, maybe for some people it is like that, but I keep building and decorating my raft from time to time. With friends it is more interesting of course, but I find it fun even playing it alone, just a little bit busier since you have to do everything by yourself. And yeah, the shark can be annoying. What I want most is more types of islands to visit. Overall it is good, still much room for development, and I believe they are working on that."

24649,"Raft is a rather peaceful, easy-to-learn, survival ocean world game with plenty of creative freedom. The story is told through notes you pick up throughout the 'story islands' and the visual appearance of the islands, while it is incomplete it is certainly interesting. The graphics are cartoonish, as well as the animations of the character and various animals in the game. They are aesthetically pleasing and quite relaxing. The game is quite a grind if you have a particular plan in mind. The animal AI in this game is basic and boring, for example, the shark will periodically attack your raft every 20 minutes or so. Also, the story updates need to release faster. But overall, this game is great, I enjoyed the main story very much and am now doing a 100% achievement run and I'm having a great time doing so. I highly recommend this game to everyone."
24650,"Good game, took about 40 houts to complete so that theres nothing new to discover. enjoyable with friends too.

24651,the game is great but i think they should a flying to creative mode because it is way harder to make cool bulids

24653,I've always liked survival games. Raft is one of the best ones out there that can be anything you want. Its as peaceful/slow/fast/chaotic as you want it to be. I would always recommend that people play this game.

24659,"The game is fun when played with friends. HOWEVER! After 4 fucking years of development, this still only has 2 chapters. WTF!!!!! You would think that a game that has been in development since 2018 would offer a story that lasted for more than 10 hours! Like WTF!!!! Am I crazy for feeling underwhelmed? Candy Crush on a mobile device offers more content than this game. Once again, great time with friends. However, at this point in time the overall lack of story content is undesirable and does not justify the purchase."

There ARE a few glitches here and there, but every game comes with such and I personally find it making the game funnier to play."

24681,"Solitude. This is Raft. It's just you and the shark. And the wood and the plastic and the metal and the barrels. You see, the real story of Raft is not a convoluted dystopian mess like the islands imply, but one of an ocean so unbelievably polluted that a single boy can build a MULTIPLE STORY, HOUSE SIZED, STRUCTURALLY INTACT RAFT using ONLY THE ITEMS HE FINDS FLOATING ON THE SURFACE OF THE OCEAN. What is up with the amount of trash? The shear quantity is astounding. At the very least, maybe Raft can convey a warning about climate change. Speaking of trash, Raft has islands. Cryptic unsolvable puzzles, infuriating enemies, clunky platforming, the islands have it all and not in a good way. If you have a friend to play with, this game is perfect. However, by yourself, all you get is solitude.

5/10"
24682,"another extremely good and fun survival game to enjoy with friends

but unlike alot of games this actually has tons of content for you to enjoy aswell, and they are planning on adding more in the future.

24775,"UPDATE:

Devs blocked offline play in 1.0 and I'm changing my review to a thumbs down.
Don't mess with your community, devs!!

***

I'm extremely torn about Raft. This review is for people considering picking it up but on the fence. I give it a tepid thumbs up.

At a basic level this just fails as a *survival game*. The enemies are stupid and *annoying* as hell. If you die on Normal mode you lose your inventory as a ""penalty"" and you cannot go and recover your things like most similar games.

Overall the design has significant flaws that seriously hurt the gameplay.

Tip: If you want a zen experience and like building things and discovering things, play on Peaceful.

On Easy and Normal mode this game gets a big fat thumbs down.


CONS:
The gameplay loop is very repetitive and can be very grindy.
The gameplay makes very little sense. The mechanics are stylized and non-realistic in the extreme. Why do I need to pound on the sea bottom for 5 seconds to gather *sand*
The world is empty except for a very small number of creatures. Why so few fish in the sea!?
The enemies are ridiculous and ANNOYING. The enemies do the exact same thing every single time on an exact schedule. The shark attacks your raft after some specific period of time. Your ability to fight him off is annoyingly limited.

PROS:
It's very pretty and the graphical design is great. The water is awesome.
The construction is fun.
The Peaceful mode is absolutely the winner. Survival modes are ridiculous.
Very zen-like on Peaceful."
24776,A fun relaxing game that is pretty charming. I've loved playing this just when I want to relax and wind down after a long day. The game play loop is a small bit grindy but relaxing overall which I think it plays to this game's strength.
24777,too much water
24778,Fun game to play with friends (if you have any). Looking forward to future updates.
24779,really fun with friends if u have any. if u like open world like subnautica id recommend it.
24780,very fun and kill shark very funny

24786,"I played this with some friends, but the friend with the lagiest wifi hosted the server so sometimes it didn't work very well and we couldn't host it because the world was on his laptop. If you want to buy it make sure to buy friends first (make sure they have good wifi) Check who has the best wifi and only play when everyone is online so you all get to play together and no-one gets left behind. Dikke vette peace!"

24811,EEEEEEEEEEEEEE
24812,"the bulk of the gameplay appears to be casting a hook into the ocean to obtain materials to make your raft larger. was kinda fun with buddies for a few hours but ultimately ends up short with boring core gameplay mechanics, the grind isn't enjoyable or fun and not even worth it because rewards are just ""oh you get to survive for a few more minutes lol have fun drfiting endlessly"" and then you find an island and theres literally nothing on it besides a singular pineapple or something wow so cool and fun. 

I wish i refunded before I hit the two hour mark"

24855,"This is a very well developed and well though out game. Every element within the game (story, characters, enemies, actions, etc) work seamlessly. There is not one object, texture or animation within the game where I thought ""this doesn't fit the genre/story of the game"" nor have I ever encountered any bugs. Definitely the best $20 I've spent on Steam so far. Super excited for Chapter 3. Kudos to the devs."
24856,good game
24857,"yep
goopd"
24858,I love it when the shark eats my ass
24859,I don't like this game because I am bad at it.
24860,"Awesome game. 11/10. Love the building flexibility and simplicity. I love that it allows for us to build a pirate ship lol.
Highly recommended if you want a casual game of adventure and survival with your friends!
There is a story element to it and it requires exploration point to point, which will keep you going.
especially hunting for those blueprints!
Personally i feel its quite balanced. 

Although I hope that the Devs add more build options. I know this game is intended for surface play but it'll be nice if the ocean was more defined and have more depth and design rather than an endless void. Maybe make certain areas where we can find ship wrecks in the ocean? get treasure and maps and stuff. 

But most importantly, add more animals and... MONSTERS(?) 
Like a giant lizard that lives on certain islands. 
A Garuda like from the indonesian lore.
Huge snake serpent.
KRAKEN maybe? in one of the portraits in-game, there is an octopus/kraken battling a ship(?) i forgot.
we thought that maybe it was a teaser for upcoming updates.

Patiently waiting for the new Chapter 3 and updates!!!!"

24875,Great mix of survival and creation/building game play. Sort of like MineCraft but with more realistic buildings and furniture (like the Sims). I love this game. Great way to pass the time.
24876,amazing to play with friends
24877,this game its just like a time waster i was playing for like five minutes and i ended up playing it for like four hours and its just like so much fun i definitely say like a 4.9 out of a 5 because it does have a little lag and a couple of glitches but yeah keep it up i'm excited for chapter three!!!

24905,GOOD GAME
24906,"If you haven't already got raft or ever played it then just do. It's not a game for one kind of person nor is it a game that's perfect but damn, it's one of the best games for such a price.
"
24907,"Honestly just a very enjoyable game to play with one or two friends.
The building mechanics might not be finished yet but it is very fun to just simply see your raft get bigger and bigger.
However, I still think the best part of the game is the story mode: one can [b] really [/b] get invested into it for roughly 10 hours (3 players). 
The game just overall has this great eerie atmosphere that perfectly fits the setting, while still being so ""calming"" at the same time?
10/10, even for an early access with plenty of bugs."
24908,"Good game

24917,it is a fun survival game which can be intense at time especially when your load on food and recources which is a good aspect to the game. there is also different difficulties for more and less experienced players. there is also a creative mode where you can design your raft while being able to craft any item in the game without the resources so you can build and decorate your raft freely
24918,This game is ASS
24919,you can kill sharks. Sharks are friedns not fod.
24920,very good
24921,Fun
24922,"often I hate to write reviews ,  but I enjoyed so much in this game so I feel like it is my mandatory to give it a good long review , because all the good time it gave me and still giving. 
Most of the people who bougt this game never regreat about this decision , and so do I.
I very like this game because of so much things that makes it unique.
The concept of living and evolve on rhapsode is good , but it will become boring , so they made it unique and added enemies to the game , and while you expend you rhapsode you need to complete diffrent missions and fight in diffrent enemies (shark and other monsters) that stops you. This game makes the best out of this concept , even if there are another with the same , this is the best.
In addition , the stylization of the game is very welcome and simple , which is one of the reasons why everyone in every age can play this game and enjoy.
The multiplayer addition is really good and be sure to play with others which makes the game good even if you finished it and you know what's going to be in the game , I don't have any friends that bought this game , but don't let this interrupt your decision , you can find a lot of people in the dis server of the game , and chat with them in the game chat , it sounds bad but it's really fun and good substitute.
There are so much other reasons but I'm getting tired , and probably you , from this review.
I hope my review helped you in your decision, cheers."
24923,this game is really fun to play with friends! i really recommend this game!
24924,i hate raft because the rock isnt a playable character and he aint playing with me
24925,Fun building game! Chapter 1 and 2 were both interesting in their lore. Looking forward to more
24926,Good with friends
24927,"Bad gameplay, bad graphics, 

Devs take a year to add like 5 small islands even though the game has sold millions 

Terrible optimisation 

Game has had like 4 years development it should be done

Only good element (friends needed)

think of it as a road trip building a home for you and your friends to explore the ocean to be able to seen new places together, that’s why I give it thumbs up as that side of the game is very engaging"
24928,Fun to play with friends and expand more and more
24929,Very fun game to play with friends or loved ones; my then girlfriend and i were obsessed. Thank you for the memories. <3
24930,"Honestly pretty fun game with friends, I really wish the Devs gets way more support than they do right now, because what they're having is genius"
24931,its fun

24934,good game
24935,"Super nostalgic for kids like me who played ""live on a raft"" games in the bath!"
24936,Nice chill game with a relaxing soundtrack better with friends especially because it is very grindy the graphics are really good for the art-style defiantly recommend a play
24937,the shark took everything from me
24938,"great game, the only thing is make sure that if you play multiplayer you have the person that has the best internet make the world or else it is super laggy."
24939,Love it super calming and fun

24954,ITS GREAT
24955,Chapter 3 is fun.
24956,"From the surface it seemed pretty basic, you have a raft, hook in items/stop at islands to farm stuff, rinse and repeat though there's actually a fair bit more to it as you'll discover when you play! Was pretty fun playing through with a friend, and am eagerly awaiting the next chapter!"
24957,it is good
24958,raft
24959,"big whale, im scared"
24960,"So far, this game is addicting. I had to put it on easy mode though at eventually because it felt like my hunger and thirst were affecting me super fast, interfering with getting used to the rest of the basics of the game. That was just my experience though. I've since upped the difficulty since I got used to it.  I guess that's generally how learning games goes :)"
24961,QUITE GOOD WITH MATES AND WELL THE STORY IS INVITING ENOUGH. worth full price and when the game fully comes out the game will be fantastic
24962,"This is a pretty fun game but I wish my character didn't have diabetes.

Having to down 15 pineapples before going on a 5 minute island walk is annoying."
24963,super coool and fun
24964,nice
24965,its a delightful game

24972,fun game
24973,best game ive ever played i swear to god
24974,"Needs a little teamwork, but definitely entertaining."
24975,A blast to play 2-4 player. Not the most fun to play by yourself with how often you go hungry and thirsty.
24976,Takes a bit of practice if you're new. But its a blast once you get going
24977,boat
24978,good game
24979,its a fun game where you can build what ever you want
24980,yo poggies water

24984,nice
24985,"you know, water, its cool."
24986,TO COOL
24987,"It has the best story to a game that i've actively tried to chase, what i mean by this is that i don't really care about lore but this games lore is really good and has made me want more of it overall such a game like this will make me play for years as long as updates come with lore updates."

24992,"If you like survival, exploring, crafting and base building,,,, This is the best game for you. I highly recommend this game for you :D"
24993,"Very addicting game, endless things to do. Plus time passes very quickly. Highly recommend."
24994,I've played through this game almost twice now. I love that I can just sail around and work on my boat and ignore the story if I want. Playing with others is one of the greatest aspects of the game actually. The story has depth and mystery and even a little bit of spookiness to it.  If nothing else come on and enjoy the views and the sunsets.
24995,wet
24996,"Great Game with Plenty to do, explore, and figure out!"

24998,good
24999,"Good survival game.  I would appreciate a few little  ""How-to"" notes in the journal."
25000,awesome game to play with the friends and family its a online multiplayer stor driven game but you can also go at your own speed and just avoid the story part and just build in creative mode

10/10 would die and restart again."

25023,It is kind of like minecraft but on the ocean and you are constantly moving in the water and there are islands. The only thing i think i would change about this game would be to make it longer in the storyline and harder to beat.
25024,raft? more like fart

25035,I enjoy playing it with my daughter :)

Hate the Seagulls of course.  (where are auto shotgun turrets when you need them!)

25041,"Quite a bit glitchy, on my second survival world there was a storm and I got to a land mass and at one point the raft glitched INTO the land mass and got stuck in a mountain other than that this game is pretty good."

25043,i like this game
25044,raft
25045,this game has so much to do that you will never find yourself bored and will instead find yourself listening to your favorite podcast and building your raft. Also to mention that this game has a loving discord server where you can play this game with anyone and it will be a blast!!!!!

"
25050,good with friends :)
25051,"Love the game, but cant play more than 15 min without feeling sea sick, even with the sea sick mode on. 
The water wasn't the problem, it was the  ""close 2 death effects""
Even on land i had a hard time not feelign sick. 

it would be nice if u could add a setting or something where the ""close 2 death effects"" is just som sound or blinking health bars <3"
25052,i make it my life misson to kill shark
25053,lol
25054,"LEMME JUST SAY IVE NEVER PLAYED A GAME FOR 24 HRS WITHIN 2 DAYS AFTER PURCHASING 100000% EVEN IN 2022 THIS GAME LIVES UP TO UR EXPECTATION! HIGHLY RECOMMEND! Great for new gamers, gamers who want a good time with friends or alone with your creativity! WORTH EVERY PENNY!!"
25055,"Plenty of glitches. Randomly dropping you underwater. Shark randomly attacking from nowhere. If you save underwater you just die upon reload. If you die you lose all your items possible, potentially softlocking and having you restart your entire save. Absolutely wonderful"

25060,its a good game
25061,i like pretending to be the shark and killing my friends with a spear while they arent looking 10/10 would gaslight them again
25062,VERY good just keep a clock next to you i played for 7 hours
25063,Very fun game tbh
25064,it's a lot more exciting than minecraft and a lot more chill than valheim. i like that your base is always with you (unless you forget to anchor it)
25065,Me and the boys liked pretending to be pirates so much that we all decided to buy this game. Let's just say that now our dream can become a reality in this game. 10/10. Also a very good game to play when you need to escape the wife.
25066,oh hell yeah
25067,Cool gayme
25068,"COOL, this game is awesome! i recommend Doing multiplayer though"
25069,"Overall, it's just a great game. It's packed with cool lore and story, and has awesome mechanics. There are so many more things I could mention to make this game great. If you're reading this getting this game is definitely not a waste of money. Plus, it's always getting updated. Great game. 8/10, would recommend. Is a bit grindy though, so if that's not your thing, then you probably shouldn't get this."

25071,LOVE IT
25072,fun
25073,can confirm this game takes place on a raft 10/10 can recomend
25074,"haha, i hate the shark"
25075,"[b]TLDR;[/b] What're you waiting for? Hop on your raft and poke some sharks!

One of my all-time favourite crafting survival games in the last year! 
Thank you devs for always giving updates on your game progress! Excited to see the next big update with new characters, an expansive new chapter for the main story, as well as taking the time to flesh out the content for us! My friends and I have completed the main story and all stocked for the next chapter. It'd be cool to have some sort of sidequests for once you finish the main storyline. Although we can sink plenty hours into fishing, gathering, chopping, building, etc., there is only so much see and do! This is still a game with lots of updates though, and you can see and feel all the love and hardwork put into it!"
25076,The game is super fun! The survival aspect and having to frantically run around to protect your raft makes the game very fun and makes you have to stay on your feet!
25077,f u n
25078,is good
25079,goood game
25080,"Skyblock on Water, with a Story/Campaign & a very commendable execution."
25081,"This game is fun alone, but far more better with friends."
25082,"I especially like the option to play on Peaceful mode, where predators don't attack, because sometimes I just want to relax after a long day and not deal with more stress.  The Creative mode is handy for learning what things can be crafted and what components are needed, it's useful for laying out a raft without having to gather the components because Creative mode provides all components, unlimited."
25083,"This remembers me of April 15, 1912"
25084,"a little hard at first, easier and way funner later on. Very original game play, good story, and honestly just fun overall.
8/10
can get a little repetitive"
25085,"This is an amazing game, and i can't say enough how fun it is to play to experience the world. If anyone is looking for someone to play with i'd be up for it"

25123,"It's a fun game to get into with friends, playing it solo however gets old very fast as it makes the game take so much longer to even just establish yourself. I'd give it a 6.5 it's alright but not something you would be playing for hundreds of hours."

"
25148,Even though it's a bit short there is still a lot of developement done and i don't get the feeling that it will stop anytime soon. I played to the current end maybe 2-3 times but haven't touched the game in a long time. I come back either for chapter 3 or if by chance a friend wants to play it. Still great game a lot of fun with friends but still quite possible alone. 10/10 can recommend.

25192,"I have really enjoyed this game way more then anticipated. I appreciate that the devs have settings for motion sickness (because yikes, after awhile it crept up on me, as well as having a setting where the shark won't bite. I did this because I find the game so peaceful. I have lost hours building my raft and customizing while being pleasantly surprised at the story unfolding. I normally don't like Early Access games but at this point, it really doesn't feel early access. Plus, the price is right."

25217,"This is a very cute game, I'm currently playing it with my 7 year old daughter. It is her first survival game and a great introduction to the genre. It's a nice slow pace (except for when the shark attacks the raft, then its a mad dash to get to it before it breaks one of our outer foundations. The shark will become a thing of the past once we have fully armoured the foundations, i wish we had discovered this before building such a large base!) the Vulture on the island is a bit of a pain on the first encounter, but once you have a bow and arrows you can kill it (along with the boar/bear) and it won't respawn on that island, which gives my daughter a chance to venture off  and do a bit of exploring. As a seasoned survival player  myself (Ark Rust, Conan, Atlas etc), it does get a little bit repetitive, but this isn't a hardcore pvp survival game, after the initial learning curve, it's a fun Sunday afternoon sail which can be enjoyed with younger members of the family or friends of any age. I would 100% recommend this game to anyone looking for a starter sea base survival game."
25218,"good game

25219,grate game i played the whole thing one thing to be aware of is at tangora the crane mini game cant reset so its eazyto get stuck  i had to use a glich to get in

25221,"Not sure how it happened, but I have logged 142 hours into this game that I bought for $10 and expected a simple time killer. It doesn't matter if you like survival, crafting, exploring, or simply the sound of ocean waves... this game has something for you. Would recommend 10/10."

"
25230,"Gameplay: Fun!
Graphics: Good, not at all demanding. ""Simple but effective""
Age: Older kids can play without worrying about darker subtext in the notes. 

This game reminds me a lot of Subnautica, but is a much simpler version of it, and on a raft. You can collect resources at the surface or dive near an island reef to get many more. Researching items unlocks new crafting recipes, allowing the player to expand and improve their raft and their own capabilities. It's novel, engaging and fun! 

The world is beautiful and engaging! It's a bit simplistic, so I often felt like I was aware that it was just a game and not a world in itself. 

Suggestions to the Devs: 
- Great work! This is a fantastic game! 
- A brief tutorial in the very beginning might be nice. I wasn't sure what to do. Perhaps tooltips would help, or more detailed descriptions on item recipes. 
- It feels kind of silly to only be able to dig for dirt, sand or clay at certain pre-defined locations. It also feels silly to require a shovel for dirt but a hook for clay and sand. I almost feel like a better approach would be to let the user dig by hand (very slowly) anywhere, but then the shovel lets them do it much faster. 
- It feels kind of silly that only certain trees can be cut down. Surely even larger trees would have useful branches! 
- ""Brunos Hammer"" and similar: should be ""Bruno's Hammer"": add the apostrophe to make it possessive.
- Wool seems hard to attain due to pufferfish being so rare. I'd like for there to be other ways of getting wool. Perhaps it could be obtained from crates or barrels. Perhaps better yet, the player could kill the wild critters and get some wool that way."

25234,"After seeing the news and updates that the devs have for the upcoming chapter 3 for Raft, I can say that Raft can still be an enjoyable experience to have with, either by yourself or with friends on both projects and objectives to make your time with your raft more manageable. However,
I still say that some faults to this are still present, such as the crafting part of the game for certain tools and equipment with no hints on having a chance to repair damaged items, rather than wasting resources to making a new one, low chances of harvesting tree seeds from palm and mango on both islands and on tree crops, no new ways of introducing new weapons to accomidate for ranged or melee weapons, more ways to increase farming for both plants and animals and mostly important I can say that is the worst idea for this game - adding a backpack feature for when you die in normal diffculty in the game for a chance to retrieve your items from the last spot you died in. This is perhaps the worst setting to the game as it makes it harder for players to get back everything that they have lost from dying, either by the shark or by some other means of game design (especially in late game where the stakes are high and your equipment is too valuable to lose). Other than that, this game is fairly decent to play and giuve it a try, just don't expect any monthly or weekly updates to make the game more easier and just focus on having fun in it."
25235,GOOD GAME HEH
25236,"sharcc attacc
"
25237,"Raft, so far is an incredible game. Little bugs, and the ones that are there can be fixed yourself very easily. The game has so much interesting lore and story, along with many items with many uses. The only thing I will criticise this game for however, is that some achievements take FOREVER to complete. A lot are ones you get from easter eggs, some with <1% chance of appearing, and some where you have to kill a certain amount of enemies is brutal. But if you don't focus on achievements and are considering buying the game, it's 100% worth it!"
25238,Its a great survival game but better if you bring firends
25239,"it is so fun and exeslit
"
25240,"I had high hopes for this game.  It seemed like such a creative concept and I love building stuff.  

I've played only an hour so far, but I honestly hate it.  There's no tutorial, and figuring out even the basic controls was so annoying and hard.  Collecting trash to build stuff is annoying and hard, the hook is really slow, even in easy mode I kept getting attacked by the shark and couldn't figure out how fighting worked.  No character customization at all.  I like the IDEA of this game, but so far, I really hate actually playing it."

25263,"Raft is a game where you are on a raft and you have to craft items and survive. It is about $20 and worth it. The only complaints I have is the fact that the hook doesn't go very far when you throw it unless you have your camera facing the sky, my raft got glitched inside the island shores sometimes, and If you go too far from your raft everything disappears. Also, one time I was near a ton of islands, but no trash/loot showed up when I needed plastic and other stuff. The game is very good though. I love how the creator made the blueprints for the reciever and antenna show up in the early game and also how they only show up in the barrels and crates. Also, for extra entertainment, you can name the shark by just saying your shark is named that in real life. My shark's name is Sasha. Anyways, the game is very fun and difficult."

25270,"Not great , not Bad, very shallow (pardon to pun) when the game first released much like sea of thieves but has added a decent amount of minor content over the years such as dolphins,whales and the like the like, doesn't really add to the game outside of appeareances but still nice to add to the sea life so ocean isn't quite as dead.
In summary a good game to catch on sale and play with friends, but it's a small game and runs out of content quickly."
25271,You gotta like survie in the ocean
25272,grate game an updates are coming with new quest an building
25273,A good game with friends
25274,fun
25275,"This game is an absolute blast. I've played quite a bit of it, most of which was with company and it's equally fun with or without friends. At least to me. 

I'm in love with the simplicity of everything. The UI as well as the graphics are simple, but not so simple as to take away from the quality of the game, and I quite like the music. It feels so...serene. 

Though I have a suggestion for future updates, and that's to give players a little more of a challenge. The shark becomes less of an obstacle and more of a hindrance after a while, no matter the difficulty. Why not add different types of challenges? Whales surfacing just a little too early and knocking the raft a little bit, or slapping its tail in front of the raft so that players get splashed, and maybe those occurrences can damage the raft or knock supplies off of it. I want to see more challenges going forward. 

But I'm not complaining. The way the game is now is already a lot of fun. Most definitely worth the full price."

25285,"I quit because of game-breaking bugs regarding mob spawning, as well as weird gameplay choices that forced me to install mods.

My inventory screen is overlapped by the crafting screen on every resolution I try (from 1600x900 to 2560x1080, full screen or windowed). This issue is immensely frustrating, has multiple posts about it online, and has never been fixed. 

My hook keeps glitching out and getting stuck mid-cast or being cancelled early. You can't harvest rocks with the hook if they are peeping out of the ocean or are on land, despite there clearly being areas in the game where they have been designed this way. 

I ran into a known and apparently common bug where no bears and no boss mobs spawned on a major island. I then proceeded to two more islands (which should reset the original island and potentially fix the bug), and on the third island I also spawned absolutely no mobs, which are required for game progression. I was so frustrated I quit the game at this point, but I will mention the other things I experienced.

Sometimes when you destroy a wall, you will get everything that was mounted on that wall back in your inventory (as intended), yet other times the mounted items will just disappear forever. Why? I save before I make any modification to my raft now because I'm so worried about items disappearing.

The Screecher mobs, big flying birds that drop rocks on your head, are so awful that I had to install a mod to remove them. They are incredibly hard to hit with a bow and arrow (expensive to make), have an immense amount of health, come back like every minute and prevent you from doing things outside while they're around, and their loot is terrible.

The shark respawn rate is far too quick. You kill the shark and it's back within three minutes. This is unrealistic and unfun. There is no mod I could find to change the respawn rate of the shark, so I just flat out had it removed too, which I didn't want to do.

Please give us Steam Workshop support so that we aren't forced to use a website for mods that has no way to filter mods and no comment section."
25286,It's a fun game. :)
25287,lidl game dont buy

25307,"I am not much of a gamer and rarely play multiplayer, so when I was constantly having to build more and more scarecrows and fight off sharks eating my raft I was quite frustrated because I just wanted to explore darn it! However, they have a peaceful mode now! Now even not-gamers like me playing all by themselves can have hours of fun exploring, building, and decorating without constantly having their food, flowers, and raft eaten.
So now if you want to trundle along island to island digging up buried treasure in a semi-automated 300 foundation raft with multiple floors and buildings, lots of animals, and a grassy forest on your roof to play music in while waiting for the next update like me, you can worry free! (Just remember to put your animals on the second floor or higher or you may have them glitch under the raft and swept away and lost forever when big waves hit. Still on the hunt for a replacement rare colored lama.)"

25310,I mean... it has the same effect as minecraft.  You get absorbed in building the next thing as you collect resources.  It's fun. Play it.
25311,Good game.
25312,This game is a great game to play especially if you like survival or building games as you can build a huge raft or a quaint little home on the seas while protecting it against the shark. You also need to grow your food or kill other animals to survive.

25317,Its really good

25362,I hate that shark
25363,"I genuinely wouldn't have thought ""Okay it's a survival game, but you're on a raft and there's a shark"" would be engaging on any level, but this game has a lovely mix of mechanics, character, and steady growth and discovery, and I've found that to be incredibly fun and engaging.

Once you've gotten past the immediate threat of starvation and you've gone on to tricking out your raft, the game really opens up into something with a great atmosphere, a pleasant aesthetic, and a story/lore that works a lot better than you'd expect.

Plus, there are few things quite as fun as messing around on a digital raft with your friends while playing Pokemon surfing music and wearing a boar's head as a hat.

Strongly recommended, especially if you've got friends with you."

                         Whoa. Hold on. Do you know what that 
                         thing can do to you?
 
                                     MAN3
                         Yeah, it'll grind your bones for it's 
                         bread.
 
               Shrek sneaks up behind them and laughs.

                                     SHREK
                         Yes, well, actually, that would be a 
                         giant. Now, ogres, oh they're much worse. 
                         They'll make a suit from your freshly 
                         peeled skin.
 
                                     MEN
                         No!

                                     SHREK
                         They'll shave your liver. Squeeze the 
                         jelly from your eyes! Actually, it's 
                         quite good on toast.
 
                                     MAN1
                         Back! Back, beast! Back! I warn ya! 
                         (waves the torch at Shrek.)
 
               Shrek calmly licks his fingers and extinguishes the torch. The 
               men shrink back away from him. Shrek roars very loudly and long 
               and his breath extinguishes all the remaining torches until the 
               men are in the dark.
 
                                     SHREK
                         This is the part where you run away. 
                         (The men scramble to get away. He laughs.) 
                         And stay out! (looks down and picks 
                         up a piece of paper. Reads.) ""Wanted. 
                         Fairy tale creatures.""(He sighs and 
                         throws the paper over his shoulder.)
 
                         
               THE NEXT DAY

               There is a line of fairy tale creatures. The head of the guard 
               sits at a table paying people for bringing the fairy tale creatures 
               to him. There are cages all around. Some of the people in line 
               are Peter Pan, who is carrying Tinkerbell in a cage, Gipetto 
               who's carrying Pinocchio, and a farmer who is carrying the three 
               little pigs.
 
                                     GUARD
                         All right. This one's full. Take it 
                         away! Move it along. Come on! Get up!
 
                         
                                     HEAD GUARD
                         Next!

                                     GUARD
                         (taking the witch's broom) Give me that! 
                         Your flying days are over. (breaks the 
                         broom in half)
 
                                     HEAD GUARD
                         That's 20 pieces of silver for the witch. 
                         Next!
 
                                     GUARD
                         Get up! Come on!

                                     HEAD GUARD
                         Twenty pieces.

                                     LITTLE BEAR
                         (crying) This cage is too small.

                                     DONKEY
                         Please, don't turn me in. I'll never 
                         be stubborn again. I can change. Please! 
                         Give me another chance!
 
                                     OLD WOMAN
                         Oh, shut up. (jerks his rope)

                                     DONKEY
                         Oh!

                                     HEAD GUARD
                         Next! What have you got?

                                     GIPETTO
                         This little wooden puppet.

                                     PINOCCHIO
                         I'm not a puppet. I'm a real boy. (his 
                         nose grows)
 
                                     HEAD GUARD
                         Five shillings for the possessed toy. 
                         Take it away.
 
                                     PINOCCHIO
                         Father, please! Don't let them do this! 
                         Help me!
 
               Gipetto takes the money and walks off. The old woman steps up 
               to the table.
 
                                     HEAD GUARD
                         Next! What have you got?

                                     OLD WOMAN
                         Well, I've got a talking donkey.

                                     HEAD GUARD
                         Right. Well, that's good for ten shillings, 
                         if you can prove it.
 
                                     OLD WOMAN
                         Oh, go ahead, little fella.

               Donkey just looks up at her.

                                     HEAD GUARD
                         Well?

                                     OLD WOMAN
                         Oh, oh, he's just...he's just a little 
                         nervous. He's really quite a chatterbox. 
                         Talk, you boneheaded dolt...
 
                                     HEAD GUARD
                         That's it. I've heard enough. Guards!
 
                         
                                     OLD WOMAN
                         No, no, he talks! He does. (pretends 
                         to be Donkey) I can talk. I love to 
                         talk. I'm the talkingest damn thing 
                         you ever saw.
 
                                     HEAD GUARD
                         Get her out of my sight.

                                     OLD WOMAN
                         No, no! I swear! Oh! He can talk!

               The guards grab the old woman and she struggles with them. One 
               of her legs flies out and kicks Tinkerbell out of Peter Pan's 
               hands, and her cage drops on Donkey's head. He gets sprinkled 
               with fairy dust and he's able to fly.
 
                                     DONKEY
                         Hey! I can fly!

                                     PETER PAN
                         He can fly!

                                     3 LITTLE PIGS
                         He can fly!

                                     HEAD GUARD
                         He can talk!

                                     DONKEY
                         Ha, ha! That's right, fool! Now I'm 
                         a flying, talking donkey. You might

25385,Nothing more terrifying than watching your friend fall into the water and swim frantically towards your raft which has three fully fueled engines blasting full speed across the ocean.

25388,"Fun game, just got into it but its fun"
25389,"very fun game, funner with friends. you can kill sharks and wear their heads. 10/10"
25390,"Constant busywork.  items deteriorate at a moderate pace, so you need to be thinking about materials to replace the tool you use to get materials, while gather materials to build the things to keep you alive.  Basically, a constant pain in the assets.  While new, and just starting, I don't see much enjoyment in the tenacity of constant need to be scrambling.  There is no peace, no moment to simply read, study, or learn the game.  Just.. go go go go go go go die go go go die go go go go die die go go go.. and you never really feel like you accomplished anything other than postpone death.  Kinda.. lame."
25391,"Pretty fun! I do recommend playing in multiplayer, so everything is a bit easier! It's also very nice that it's constantly updating, and you can decorate and make individual rooms!"

25444,"🏊🏼Raft🏊🏼
🧜🏾 Ocean survival where you live and build on a raft, exploring islands, the ocean, and gathering supplies
🚣🏾Very much a grinding game, storyline is still in development
🐬Challenging or more relaxing depending on the difficulty you choose
🧜🏾‍♂️Co-op, fun with friends 
🚣🏾Some bugs and world glitches, but the game can autosave every 10 minutes meaning if you run into trouble you have world backups.
🐬Beautiful graphics
🐳The game runs on lower spec pcs, even lower settings look nice still
🚣🏾Graphics really pretty
🚣🏾There is also a creative mode
🐳Has a hunter/gatherer aspect 
🧜🏾‍♂️Gave me Minecraft vibes, so if you like open world survival you will enjoy this game
🐳Seagulls are mfs
🐬🐬And the shark ate my ass like groceries🐬🐬


Edit: 75hrs in and still fun asf
Edit: 119 hours in, you can still have fun but iv gotten almost all the achievements and theres not much left to discover. Building your raft is the main objective after that. So for now, it's kinda like in Minecraft where you have everything you could possibly need. Not as enjoyable but still a great coop game. When they update I will add another edit :)"

25482,"The underlying ideas of this game (island hopping on a raft) have potential. I'm not sure this game can accomplish that, even once it has left early access.

Some things I can tie to polish & time; lack of any tutorialising, stilted & awkward combat, bugs (enemies kept clipping through terrain for one), repetitive environments (); all that can be improved with time, and will likely be by the end of early access.

Execution however is poor, as this game lacks the flexibility of OWSC games like minecraft; or the simple, solid systems & objectives of a game like subnautica. 

There is very little to do beyond expand your raft, then track down radio signals. Minute-to-minute gameplay is hampered by fast hunger/dehydration, a constantly aggressive enemy (fuck the sharks) and a fragile raft THAT CAN BE LOST (effectively a game over though the game doesnt treat it as such), and enemies I only managed to kill by taking advantage of bugs. Maybe my playing solo ""isnt the intended experience"", but what little fun I had was despite the game and not because of it."

25531,A very fun game that simulates life on a raft I would recommend playing with friends as alone it can get boring however online it is just chaotic as you and your fellow survivors slowly descend into madness from the constant rocking of the boat and the emptiness of the world around you. The joy you feel upon reaching an island after being lost at sea for hours is amazing and getting your feet on something that doesn't sway is very enjoyable. I would recommend this to anyone that wants a fun survival game or something casual to relax to.

25551,"Although I recommend it, I want to let others know that it is a slow start and might be a little challenging depending on your skill level for the first few hours. You don't get the dopamine hits until you really get into chapter 1 of the game. Then the progress is pretty steady and smooth. I also recommend playing with another person to speed things up in the begining. It can get boring at times and having someone with you really helps."
25552,Great fun with low stakes/stress. Great for bonding online with friends.
25553,"[h1] Best Addicting Experience [/h1]

After 25 hours of playing... I can surely say that this game is addicting. 
Having a background in Minecraft and the understanding of its mechanics does have its perks when playing Raft... However, i find that even knowing all that knowledge you don't really need to have much to get into this game. 
Raft is one of those games that you can dive in whenever. But, fair warning that you can get trapped in this game for 3 hours and still find more stuff to do! 

If you are a fan of survival games you will enjoy this game for its expansiveness and beauty. Massive islands to explore, hopping onto shipwrecks, fighting different Animals/creatures (especially the shark), and the freedom of building the ship anyway you want it!

[h1] My Critical Response [/h1]

1. Survival mechanics and exploration can be daunting yet rewarding
2. There are points in the game where the shark can glitch into the island making it easier to attack (not a deal breaker)
3. Getting a good start to the Raft is slow, and again daunting. However, overtime it will get easier. 
4. Don't set out in getting one item. Try to multitask in getting an array of items. 
5. The RNG (randomly generated) Crates and Barrels can be your best friend when stuck. 
6. If you are playing on a harder difficulty I highly recommend getting prepared and geared up for more frequent shark attacks.
7. Having a lot of storage and having the garbage is critical when you have an abundance of items. 
8. Dying is normal in survival games. However, unlike in minecraft, easier difficulties in Raft makes it so you don't lose your items. 

TLDR:

Just have fun!

25556,Got me a big ole raft
25557,This shark has a level of persistence and determination that I will never achieve. It's really quite admirable... I hate him.
25558,"It’s a good game, but pretty boring by yourself. Unless you enjoy playing by yourself, but if you play with your friends or literally anybody you see the game in a new way. I’m not going to explain anymore  as you guys should experience it by yourself with someone.

As for the price wait until a sale to buy. I just don’t think it worth $20 for a game that’s mainly enjoyable with other people."
25559,"Alot of fun with friends, However:

RNG. Slow paced gameplay. Not much to do. No trading cards. Only fun with friends.

25568,"Great game to play with friends, even better to relax to by yourself.  HOWEVER, the game is not finished and clearly reflects this with the lack of content updates as of recent.  After the big content creators boosted the sales they seemingly game up on adding anything else and moved onto their other games.  Unless they finish this game I cannot recommend it."

25582,"Game feels pretty bare bones in the state it currently is. The story doesn't have the plot completed and you just sail to a story island to the next and that's it. Exploring the story islands and solving the puzzles there is fun but once you catch up to the unfinished story as I have, there's nothing else to do. You can automate tasks such as refueling engines, purifying water, and watering crops but I feel that there's no point to doing that with no goal to achieve and no story to pursue once you have caught up to the story. 

Buy the game when it's complete or if it's really cheap at around $5. Not worth in it's incomplete state."

I ADORE multiplayer though, and would pick this game over a lot of other open world options because they have just done a really good job of making it fun. 

I would like to see a few more character creation options though. Even if it was just a couple more generic characters. Its hard when all your friends look the same! 

Solid 8/10 for sure"

Hope fully in the near future we can get some more wild life in the ocean it just feels empty most the time with just a shark being around 24/7. On side note would love to have had some character custimization. Other than that all the decreations that you can make for the raft is so cool and hope more will be added in the future after other important updates like etc. chapter 3

Raft is a great multiplayer minecraft esque game where you can explore the ocean, combat fun and unique animals all whilst slowly upgrading from tiny raft to full on mechanical boat. The gameplay is great, the progression is perfectly paced and the story is fun to follow along to. I highly recommend for anyone who wants to try something new!"

25608,"It's a decent game, but I feel like the company is more concerned with other activities like charity events etc than the game itself. Development is very slow and things to do are very lean. I promise you'll have fun with the game, but politically their heart seems to be in other things."
25609,The best game of it's kind out there imo. You can set the difficulty how you like and the graphics are really nice. Tons of fun if you like crafting and building with plenty of exploration too. It's the only early access game where I honestly thought it was worth more than I paid for it. I would warn people who have seizures from blinking lights though the oxygen meter in the game flashes in a way that I think may trigger those.
25610,"Laggiest game that I have ever played. For those who have a $5k computer set up, a perfect game. It seems fun but I can't even move without the frame rate being absolute garbage. Sacrificed frame rate for graphics. Very pretty game though. Wish I could actually play it lol."

25654,gudgame
25655,"Overall this game is pretty top notch.  

Pros:

Music when it plays is pretty relaxing.  Once you obtain the boombox and tapes, music gets even better.

The difficulty is really whatever you want it to be.  Beginner is super forgiving, where as scaling it up is extremely not.  Hope you have friends, because passing out in this game means anything you are carrying at that time is gone.  

Game looks extremely beautiful as well.  Yeah the animations of the animals is pretty meh, but don't let that distract you from how the world itself looks.  The characters and animals supposed to have these cartoonish features.  

Building is actually extremely fun.  Building various raft types is fun and the game is partially forgiving as well.  Most things give you 100% of the mats back, others at least half.  You can make sure pretty nice things in this game.  

Cons

There is basically zero info in terms of a tutorial.  You start off on a 4x4 raft and then best of luck.  It took basically 2 play throughs to really get the idea of how to setup.  

Playing solo is extremely tedious.  As someone that's played both a solo world and one with friends, I know you'll have a better time with friends.  Upgrading the boat, gathering resources, shooing those damn birds away will you give you more APM than any MOBA game out there.

The story is well over 4 years old.  I got lucky and bought this in 2021 and believe me, it was the right move.  Anyone that's played this since launch, you're the true heroes.  The chapters come out at a snails pace, and almost every time something new comes out, you may as well restart.  

Resources.  Remember how I said getting those is literally a primary function, well it is, and then get ready for the point where you think you have storage, you don't.  You think you have enough of one resource, you don't.  You think you have enough food, you don't.  Now eventually they are putting trading stations in the game, which may help this issue, but nothing is more frustrating than having 1000 rope and nothing to do with it.  

Old items - another semi issue I have.  I'd rather the starting item not be basically trash later.  It would have been better if a starting item then turns into the better item later, and then you just know how to make the upgraded version later.

Overall I'd give the game 7/10."

25664,"This game is a really fun game to play, especially with friends, the grinding and building are all really fun, but once you beat the story there's not much to do afterward. I have been waiting for a little over a year for them to release chapter 3 and still nothing, But overall it's a genuinely fun game"

25676,"I like Among Us. I REALLY like Among Us. Everytime I see someone, I yell ""SUS"" at the top of my lungs. Everyone avoids me because I KNOW they think that I'M sus. Everywhere I go in public, I wear a red shirt so everyone around me knows that I'm the red crewmate. I wear an Among Us branded hat, Among Us branded shoes, Among Us branded thigh highs, Among Us branded pants, etc. I wear the same clothing everyday. I jack off to Among Us porn every two hours. My friends have left me. They don't accept my lifestyle, so they are sus. My parents have disowned me, so they are sus. Nobody likes me, so they are sus. My sus wife took my son. Please help me everything has been taken from me. Please."

25685,"It may be a slow, mellow game but I found it quite enjoyable and relaxing."
25686,"Fun game with a variety of things to do and paths to focus down; whether combat is your thing, farming, or exploring, Raft does an excellent job of scratching the itch for adventure."
25687,"A wonderful time on the high seas!! One of the few game where you can fell the progress you're making, as you go from raft adrift; to a hearty vessel of the seas. A good way to spend an afternoon uncovering the secrets of the high seas solo or with a team online, one of the better multiplayer experiences I have had the pleasure of playing. 

-Great core game-play loop
-Gripping story
-Stable multiplayer
-Consistent updates, and a communicative Dev team

If you want to try a new style of survival game with a focus on man v.s. nature, I would greatly encourage you purchasing this game."

25725,This is a very fun game when everything else has become to toxic. Its simple but can be very complex with how you want to play it. I recommend this game to everyone I meet. I just really enjoy the simplicity of the game. I could play it for hours with no one but myself. This is a 10 out 10 for me.

Id love more tech and the ability to have ur raft on the main screen that would be cool 

also some inventory sorting would be cool bring on more updates im ready to sink at least another good 50 to 100 hours before restarting and doing it all over again"

25765,"Very fun, is difficult early on but it has a good learning curve to difficulty balance that makes gameplay fun and new and exciting as you improve your gear and raft."
25766,"It's an okay game in my opinion... Its a bit hard but it is fun at times. Other times it may be stressful when thirsty or hungry.
The shark tho. The shark well he... i promised i wouldn't tell his secret but...  He loves to eat wood."
25767,great way to spend countless hours of time instead of bonding with my child.
25768,"Raft is a fun survival game and is great if you want a game about building a raft, but it still made me feel incredibly nauseous and sea-sick despite turning on the sea-sickness mode. I don't get nauseous easily so I was very disappointed and surprised. Had to stop playing because no matter what I did, there were still waves - their sea-sickness setting was terrible and didn't help at all.

I understand its an ocean-based game and the ocean has waves, but I'm not prone to being sea-sick and I still managed to feel ill. It ruined the experience, so I can't recommend the game."
25769,ye
25770,good game cant wait for the update!!
25771,"Unique and amazing!!!!!


"
25772,"slow at start, but really fun when you start getting into building and gathering a bunch of resources.  Grows from survival to simulator"
25773,really chill and fun with friends 7/10. would be higher if not for lack of content

25779,good
25780,"So far I'm really enjoying playing this game with my cousin. It starts off slow and tedious when you're first building your raft and at the mercy of the waves and the wind, but it really gets it traction when you unlock the radar. The game is still early access so the devs may make the beginning a little bit better but still a good experience overall. I really recommend giving it a try with friends."
25781,good survival game and nice story line
25782,Good
25783,"If you wanna get lost more then you already are, get this game!"
25784,best game!!! wish the story was 50x longer
25785,Man a waterworld based survival game i mean i never seen anything like this before played a few hours and hell i recomend it 100%  10000/10 recomend.
25786,"e

25787,"I have liked the game from early on, but the renovation update has added so much customization, I can't help but play it repeatedly now. Really addictive and enjoyable. The story line always adds a great mystery to the game too- well made."

25789,Good Soup
25790,loving this game it's awesome to play and time really fly's while playing this game can't wait for the next chapter to come out this is going to be awesome thank you devs for making such an awesome game

25797,grate game well make fun to play with frends a a fresh brake from your normal game
25798,the time frame between chapter 2 to present and still waiting for 3 has changed my opinion on supporting this game. as a story based game we cant wait years for each chapter that may take a couple days to finish. the playthrough and more was very fun with my wife and we have been waiting way to long for new content to actually stay excited and emerced into this game. i barely remember the first playthrough at this point or what was going on in the sorry. game was fun but not anything ill support due to the lack of content and time it takes devs to produce
25799,ITS A GREAT GAME YOU SHOULD PLAY IT SOME TIME ALL THATS MISSING IS VR MODE
25800,d
25801,VERY VEEEERY slow
25802,Raft is a chill game where you can explore and expand your raft. If your bored than I recommend this game as it has over 72 hours of content.
25803,just a really fun game
25804,i had a dream that the shark ate my family it had me so enraged i ordered 8 500g bags of marshmallows. i opened the bags and recreated the monster inside of me it took awhile. but after i created my inner self i had a creature infront of me. i ate it and now i sleep peacefully.
25805,Very fun and adictive game
25806,its ok but hrd
25807,my most fav game ever!!
25808,a nice chill game game.  It is mostly resource gathering/building with occasional combat.  There is a story that you have to find once you have researched enough stuff.  Worth the price in my opinion.
25809,Replay value 10/10 and the game can be played in your own way. Anyone into survival based games I will strongly suggest this too you.
25810,Good.

25821,"Totally empty and repetitive gameplay to my taste. Plastic staff wears out in a few uses, no way to repair tools and even clay dish is dissolved on food consumption. The shark quickly becomes more of an annoyance then an enemy. No fun for me."
25822,"The game is simple build raft, shark attack. build bigger raft, shark attack. go to island, shark attack. go to bigger island, shark attack. go to bigger island and build bigger raft, shark attack finish the story so far and make bigger raft, shark attack."

25832,"A somewhat unique concept which is executed very well. It's not just about surviving, there is a story being told here about why the entire planet is an ocean and such."

25836,"Day 3478:
If anyone sees this, I am sorry. I have messed up and it is all my fault. Because of me millions will suffer. After steering my raft about 3000 miles east I am convinced that this is a dream. The end is near. Maybe it isn't a dream. The abyss draws closer. The void closes. It is drawing me closer, too.

25838,"the game has been out for 4 years and still is not fully released all its content. i had genuinely thought at this point it was complete but was let down. where the building is nice its still not enough to save such a glaring lack of content. example to get the largest form of cabinets you need to go to the second last location or last location to get the blueprint and then back track to other nearby islands in the hopes of getting the rare resource needed.... where the build customization is nice this game falls so hard on itself with lack of story, until the game is FULLY out with end and all i do not recommend buying this at full price. 

side note the graphics are a letdown. great for if you want optimization but setting everything to highest does nearly nothing when it comes to change."
25839,nice
25840,"Played it the first time and suddenly two hours disappeared. ""Woah... how did that happen?""

Died a few times at the beginning and found out there's an annoying save bug: saving doesn't work properly. You don't start with the life you had and if you ""surrender"" you lose all your items. They AREN'T DROPPED for you to pick up later.
That nearly made me quit the game, but the workaround is to backup your RGD_Users.rgd file. Then the game isn't so hardcore anymore.

Once that was discovered, the game became a time sink. There's so much to discover, so many ways to build a raft, and it nearly always feels like you're progressing. If you get stuck, a quick look at the wiki helps A LOT! There are many useful tips in there (timing is very important!).

For a game that doesn't have good graphics, it's such a drag on the graphics card. Setting to ""Fastest"" might not even be enough and you might have to reduce the resolution. The game is probably loading too many things at once or something and could be MUCH lighter on the graphics for what's it's doing.

The fact that I'm only about 40% through at 40h, able to play with friends in private and look forward to every session makes me say the game is all in all, recommendable."

25847,I recommend this game if you like a challenging survival game it has an amazing mechanics and if you want a peaceful game you can also make a peaceful one and have fun either way all I can say is I loved this game.

25852,"This is a very good game if you have the taste for it. It isn't a fast game, there is a lot of slow pased gameplay, and if you get your raft upgraded, you can honestly go AFK for quite a while. Raft is a game best played with friends, and the multiplayer is quite good. I enjoy playing it with a podcast, a video, or something else to enjoy. It's a reltively relaxing game unless you're diving, then it becomes a game as to how quickly you can either kill or juke the shark. 

It has a remarkably well made story for an open world sandbox with procediural generation.  The story isn't finished, but in it's current state, you can easily spent 20 to 30 hours up until you're out of new content, and then many more building weird shit for fun. I'd suggest getting it, it's a good time."
25853,its a good game
25854,Very good must try got it and love it
25855,"amazing, very boring when ur playing on ur own, very fun when ur playing with friends,"
25856,"  If you saw this game on youtube or any other format and thought the group of people playing this were having fun: you would probably be correct. The ""group"" of them are having a great time most likely. However if you choose to play this alone, or say have no friends so you have to, its no fun. My raft got stuck on the only island to appear multiple times even with a paddle, which put me in shit creek rather than in the ocean. The shark ate me, which made me sad. Ultimately this isnt a good game for lonely people who just wanted to build a pirate ship.

I definitely recommend this for other people to play this game isn't full done but its one of the best out there.

25876,"This game has a great concept and a great soundtrack.  What absolutely killed it for me is the enemy AI.  You will quickly come to know the familiar feeling of getting hit by things that you can't see.  Like, if you step foot on an island, no matter where the supposed ""boar"" is or bird that drops rocks on you incessantly until you die.  Yeah, I get that you can enhance your abilities and craft weapons and such.  That does not forgive boars that move at light speed and somehow are always able to sneak attack you.  It made learning this game an absolute burden.  I'll wait to see if they fix enemy AI.  If they do, I'll gladly update my review."

25921,"A deceptively deep game with a whole story built into it, and it's surprisingly fun even if you're playing by yourself. The only major downsides are the visuals aren't too great (though the water is pretty good) and you may need to play with the wiki open as some of the crafting for late-game stuff is a bit obtuse. For a **SPOILER** example, something as basic as wool or milk isn't as obvious as you may first think, as you need to physically capture a llama/goat which requires 2 other techs including crafting with an obscure material that you can only get from killing a very specific fish, preferably with a bow and arrow (3rd/4th tech if you include the arrows) then you have to know to smelt the material, which now requires a 5th tech for the smelting oven. There's probably other techs or materials required in there somewhere that I just honestly forgot. Oh and you need a 6th tech to make a grass patch to feed the animals, and you need to build a raft big enough to provide space for all of this.

Definitely a game that you'll get more out of the more time you put into it. Early game can be frustrating since you'll be working with so little and barely be able to keep yourself fed and watered, but by the end you'll be sailing a craft powered by honey and leftovers with more resources than you'll even know what to do with."

25939,"Alright so I from the amount of time I've played so far I've got a pretty good understanding of the game. I'm gonna break this down for those who are debating whether or not they should purchase with the good and the bad.

The good:

The crafting system is pretty nice and is not too hard to learn. Basic resources are pretty easy to come by. Researching new items is easy for the basic stuff, a little more challenging for the really good stuff. Decorations for your raft are plentiful and obtained very easily, I was really liking the way my raft was starting to feel like a home after a while. Islands and abandoned rafts are found often enough to keep it interesting and I'm intrigued to see what other kinds of exploration they'll add to the game.

The bad:

The shark is annoying af. Every five minutes you have to hope you notice where the shark is deciding to chomp on the foundation of your raft before it takes a block off of it. It seems to go for the outermost blocks, which isn't too bad because worst case scenario, you have to replace the one block it destroyed. Every five minutes though!? It is just aggravating to have to keep stopping what you're doing to deal with a shark you've already stabbed ten times with a spear. Then once you kill it, it respawns in three minutes and is right back on the job of being a major tool. I wish they would have made it every half hour maybe or just had the shark be a random event when returning to the raft from an island. I guess you could play on peaceful but that takes away from having to deal with the hostile creatures on the islands, which can also be annoying but hey, you decide to go on the islands and there has to be some kind of challenge. I really think they should consider changing the shark mechanics though. F U SHARK.

For now I would totally recommend this if you like building/crafting/exploring. I can't speak on the multiplayer as I haven't tried it yet. Maybe I'll update this when I do.

25945,"I love the game. There is so much to do. The game does a great job of feeling very real. When you first start out, there is a bit of stress. Building a raft, water always threatening you but very manageable, sharks if you are playing the harder version. Always on the hunt for food (especially in the very beginning) etc. and developing ways to become more productive with less effort etc. Learning as you go. 

Ocean garbage is your friend, in this game. Islands often have secrets to be found, and is a big supply source. So much room, in this game, to make it what ""you"" want it to be. Be as creative as you want, explore, test your boundaries, hunt, farm, decorate, problem solve (just like in real) etc. You will get as much or as little out of this game, as you put into it. Any questions I may have had, ""Discussions"" had the answer. You can play it casual, or with a lot of action. There are several choices, when you start the game.

I highly recommend ""Raft"", especially if you like survival games."
25946,Get wood boat. Make bigger. Keep make bigger. Too big. Make wider. Too wide cant go past island. Death.
25947,its a great game like subnatica and sea of theives
25948,"played this game with some femboy bozo, was banger af"
25949,rrllly good
25950,"holy crap this has been fun so far

i recommend learning to kill the shark as soon as possible. there should be info online how to do so, but the way I do it is [spoiler]to stand still in the water, looking at the shark, and then the second he starts opening his mouth, I back up and stab him with the spear. then you can get one or two more hits in as he retreats if you're quick. he's basically free food from then on, if you're regularly killing him before mining around the reefs around islands (which you should do, cheaper than shark bait)[/spoiler]"
25951,"A bit frustrating to learn but very fun gameplay. The story is great, extremely rewarding and fun to complete. A lowkey must buy even if just playing solo."
25952,This game has good graphics and has a lot of gameplay that you can do i recommend this game.
25953,Very good game. waiting for update :      )
25954,very fun game
25955,bad game
25956,This game is absolutely incredible. I'm rewriting this review just because of how much I love and enjoy it. I'm simply astounded by how much content this game has while still in Early Access.
25957,Very fun with friends!
25958,"Gets laggy in multiplayer, could use improvement. But overall still a nice game. if you get motion sickness, set a wide FOV and turn motion sickness mode on."
25959,Fun game. Challenging almost to the point of frustration but legitimately rewarding when you do well. Interesting lore and storyline as well as fun survival crafting gameplay.
25960,good game

25965,"This game is so much fun to play, it gives the player lots of freedom once you know what you are doing"
25966,wow
25967,zxcvxzcvzxczxczc
25968,fun and a great time killer
25969,"So much fun, I killed a shark then wore his head. Than I killed the sharks son and wore his head too! I went on to build a base.... than killed the shark again. Than I went to go play raft, its a pretty good game. Specially when you feed your friends to a shark!"
25970,FUN
25971,fun game hope for more story and also a fix to the lag exspecialy with mutiplayer
25972,"Only played the beta, by the time the rest came out i had lost interest"
25973,"Game is Fun, Though there are some game play elements that are missing imo.
some inventory improvements could be made and certain ai improvements aswell.
for example, Boar when starting to ""charge"" it will not stop until it reaches a certain length, a wall, or the water.
sometimes the limit of the boars Charge will go beyond length and just rush until it hits the target (you).
Overall Very enjoyable, highly recommended with friends over a solo playthrough."
25974,absolutely!
25975,"If u like survival games, this is the game for u"
25976,Pretty fun exploration game
25977,10\1000000
25978,DAMN SHARK BITE MY HAND OFF!!!
25979,good
25980,"Decided to try and play this game after watching Crypticfox, who streams games on Youtube, play it. He played it with his life long friend Nate Sheriff (if I am spelling his last name right). 
Thoroughly enjoying the game, and love watching them play. They are the funniest and goofiest pair of people when they play together."
25981,"I played (And streamed) this game with the awesome person who gifted me Raft. Although it triggers my thalassophobia (Did i spell that right?) along with other games like Subnautica and Black Mesa, it's a very fun game. I'll also say, singleplayer is so much more scary, because (obviously) you're by yourself, stranded on a tiny raft in the middle of the ocean. This is a game that i must 100%."
25982,"gud just like penguins in madagascar
"
25983,shark scary
25984,"Great game, that is all!"
25985,"relaxing, yet challenging enough! The more you know, the more you discover to learn.
"
25986,"Played coop.  10/10

Large gaps on update times and information though.  But when big updates do come out, they are good.  6/10

Id say itll be 2+ years likely to finish at this pace.  Wouldn't surprise me if it went closer to 5 years.

Story wise, its a bit short currently.  But the building and exploring makes up for it for now.

Will be back in 5 years.  Probably won't want another game from this company tho just for wait times alone.

"
25987,very cbt!!!!!!!!
25988,Its a super fun survival game. Its a little slow and so far its a bit difficult to fend off the shark without a bow once your raft starts growing. Its also a really nice multiplayer game :)
25989,"VERY FUN
"
25990,LOVE IT
25991,"This game feels like a 40 year marriage, you wake up not knowing whether things will go right or wrong. In this scenario, the shark would be a crazy ex wife trying to ruin all the good things you've built from the ground up. She is jealous. She is furious. If you ever thought you were safe on land, think again. If the angry boar doesn't kill you first, the bird who throws literal stones from above will. Yeah, you read that right. You get stoned. By a bird. If you survive all of that, congrats! The hunger and thirst will do what the others couldn't. All in all, you can't win."
25992,"fun and stressful like balls in mayo
"
25993,e
25994,"its a pretty good game, has some nice mechanics and unlockable decorations for your base and somewhat of a story. i would like to see some type of leveling system and the shark is absolutely overbearing when and food and water can be pretty difficult to get your hands on early on just to be aware of.

Another thing to note is when playing multiplayer (not sure if it's like this in singleplayer) if you die your team-mate MUST revive you or some of your belongings (i think 1/3 if your inventory i think) are destroyed, that means if your teammate dies in the process of reviving you, you're just messed up and you lose quite a bit of stuff. I think it would be better if it was revival OR you can lose your belongings and just have to go back and get them."
25995,"good stuff, play with friends. If you have none, you sad boy"
25996,I really recommend this game
25997,very good game you should play
25998,This game is fun if you want to play it with your friends or alone. It is foe sure worth the money. The story of this game is good. You can build what ever you want while the shark just eats your raft.
25999,"It’s rainbow six seige, what else is there to say."
26000,"its very cool!
"
26001,"ıf u play this game with ur friends ,ıts good ."

26007,Boating
26008,"You start on a four square raft.
After about 10 minutes of gathering the scrap you need from the water to craft another hook to gather more scrap you die of thirst and lose  your gathered items.
Over and over"
26009,Fun till you shit yourself from the megalodon
26010,Shark is my best friend
26011,good game
26012,yes
26013,"Great game, having fun playing it.

Waiting for more content to the game as ive completed it."
26014,"Super nice game to play with friend or alone, the story is also very pleasant.
An easy and nice crafting system for does who like to craft.
10/10"
26015,good game
26016,Very Pog
26017,Nothing more terrifying than falling into the water and swimming frantically towards your raft which has three fully fueled engines blasting full speed across the ocean
26018,very fun with friends
26019,Very good game
26020,Good fun rafting with my son and building crazy things
26021,"Man i can't believe i didn't played this game before, this is my 1st time and im absolutely obsessed with it now. i used to play it on mobile but it wasn't worth it cuz mobile version is a pay to play game. but man this one is so worth it, not only does not ask you for any money in game, but it is an actual full game too 10/10"
26022,GOOD GAME
26023,"fekf,ijejfmjemfmseiujfnumANWMUFIANWIFNwafn"
26024,this game is pretty well optimized fun and creative. recomended

26032,Peaceful reliably calms me down when I want to crrryyyyyy
26033,"This game is funny when play with friends and relax to creative anything in own ship :v  .But the price to buy this game its so expensive. So i had been waited it sale 50% :( to can buy this game. 
So the point i give to this game is only 6/10."
26034,its fun
26035,Gather Build Hunt Survive. Having a great time :)
26036,a game u can spend lots of time on
26037,"Very hard game, me and my friends friendship got tested, I don't think she loves me anymore:("
26038,"Raft is the best game to play with friends, so many things to explore!"
26039,fun w friends and cool building
26040,"it's a solid 3/10 game definitely would recommend to a friend that i hate

jk the game is pretty fun about 4/10 with 4/10 being the highest grade i could possibly give to a game"
26041,A fun craft survival game. Would definately recommend
26042,very good. very nice
26043,"Fun game to casually play with friends. Running solo would be boring though. Visually, the game is basic. But, this game is intended more for its survival game play and it runs smoothly."
26044,good game
26045,"Super fun and the decorations are everything I ever wished for in my life. I would die for this game, I would kill for this game."
26046,"minecraft but water and better. Theres a story for those that like to read and follow, or  just exploration and building an awesome raft for others. Just watch out for Bruce."
26047,good
26048,Minecraft on steroids
26049,best 20.00$
26050,"The main content of this game is eating and drinking, there's no interesting content to speak of and to make up for it the developers padded this game by forcing you to eat and drink every 10 minutes, every tool degrades after 5 minutes of use and your raft is torn apart every 5 minutes by a shark that follows you everywhere.

There's no real progression, you make your raft bigger, you make tools that degrade after 10 minutes instead of 5, you build up enough food and water storage so you don't have to be fishing and cooking every second and you can fight off the shark a little faster.

There's nothing cool to explore outside of story locations, the combat system is just mash mouse 1, base building is a mediocre as it gets, except your base floats, the whole gameplay loop is as follows:

Fish>Cook>eat -every 5 minutes
Purify water>Drink -every 5 minutes
Stab shark when he bites your boat-every 5 minutes
Throw hook at resources whenever you're not doing any of the above
Crash into an island and pick up rocks and flowers
Research and craft items that make you not die for a few minutes longer or to make your raft look pretty
Build radio antenna and travel to the set piece to get the coordinates to go the next set piece

Repeat.

It's a tedious slog that feels like a time-gated mobile game, there's way better survival games out there with much more interesting things to do."
26051,Good game and ideas but needs more content because getting to end game is very quick and after that there is not much to do other then hunt achievements. Over all id give it a 7/10 just because i played it co op and it made it much more enjoyable.

26072,"this game is not only fun but has great back story and a amazing story line... you build decorate and explore in this game, there are 5 islands up to season 2 that are the main islands or back story islands that you explore to get the back story and its so fun.... They update the game not often but when they do its big, more main islands, animals, decor, items ect.... I RLLY RECOMEND THIS GAME!!!! This is curently my favorite game and even if i beat all the islands you can always build and expand your raft and motorise it, theres always stuff to do...."
26073,"If u can send a ship flying in Kerbal Space Program, u can make a villa floating in Raft.
Co-op with friends is STRONGLY RECOMMENDED!"
26074,Great game play and may be difficult some times but is very good
26075,"gud
"
26076,"Its been so much fun playing this multiplayer. Because the design of the game is focused around the raft you're always with your friends, not halfway across some persistent world. There's a good mix of pragmatic survival work to be done and creative building / decorating to keep everyone interested. And discovering the game's story and islands together has been very rewarding. Build everything, don't look for spoilers, and remember to enjoy some relaxing nights soaking in those gorgeous moonlit waves."

26104,"I love love love this game. I can most definitely recommend you getting it, it’s cheap and there’s so much content and hours of gameplay. 
The game is constantly getting updated with new content and every time something new drops, it’s amazing. 
There’s barely any, if any bugs and it’s an amazing game to play with your friends. 
10/10 would recommend c:"

26106,"This is my third review ever on steam. 100 hours in a week is pretty self-explanatory. This game is a gem, and despite a few bugs, some clunkiness on combat, I never had such thrill and sense of achievement as in playing this game.

I started playing it in the Apocalypse Difficulty and had no regrets. Survived my first Month with over 2k+ zombies and I feel I barely scratched the surface with the game. Keep working on it devs, this might be one of the most immersive games I ever played.

All in all this is a great game, it can be a bit slow at times but provides a good challenge, the world is trying to kill you tho, so beware."
26127,it is a very fun game the you will engoy
26128,This is an awesome game that is only limited by your immagination.
26129,good game

"
26131,من أفضل العاب النجاة
26132,good
26133,fun besides the sharks
26134,"This game is amazing. Free roam, sandbox, and just constant events. It's always a thrill to play after a day of stress and work. Also if your a person who likes grinding, this game was made for you. What i'm trying to say is, it's a wonderful, pleasant, peaceful, and calming game. (if you get sea sick that might be a problem or if your afraid of oceans because the game is based off a raft in a ocean.)"
26135,this game is so zen. If I need 10 mins to chill I just hop in and float around and listen to the waves. Seriously the best mom game out there hahahaha.
26136,sure
26137,It is very entertaining though I would suggest playing with friends instead of by yourself.
26138,"poob
"
26139,good
26140,Very fun and relaxing game with so much areas to explore and lots of resources to survive. I have not tried with friends yet but i think it will be even better.

26144,"The game has taught me to always be grateful for what you, and to never waste anything, as you may never get it again. It has also taught me that teamwork will always make a better result than by yourself. it amazed me from how i went from being on a small 2x2 raft with nothing, to a week later having metal tools and a reliable food sorce with my friend, by all means pick up this game, and even the lore and story isnt even finished"
26145,Fun game good time sink kinda like Stranded Deep but cartoon
26146,Love it. a bit buggy
26147,"fun game with friends or by yourself. hours of enjoyment. though some game play aspects could be tweaked and added upon, i'd bet the developers are already aware and are hard at work with plenty more updates and content headed our way. excited to see how this game turns out!"

26149,old but good
26150,very cool and grindy
26151,"FUN

26152,the t in the name looks pretty nice
26153,Shark Wood yeah
26154,very creative and fun game if u dont have a pc but u have alaptop or xbox u can connect ur steam account and play it on geforce
26155,"games great and all, played allot but it has a FATAL flaw. if a boar rams you while your back is to a rock of wall, you will be stuck there to slowly die. you cannot access your inventory, you cannot access the menu, you cannot pause  or anything, just you, the boar goring you, and the sound of infinite hooves until you either starve to death or die of thirst. be wary of boars."
26156,"its actully a really fun game the detail is somewhat nice but this game should be played with friends not on your own 
or it might get boring after the first 10 hours of play 
over all i would reccomend this to people with friends
id rate it a 8.2/10
(gift from Ashley :))"
26157,good adventure game it tests your skills and is just overall fun
26158,There is a scary shark
26159,like it its fun try it:)

26161,"Fun crafting game, my only complaint is the hunger meter is pretty unreasonable."
26162,suuii
26163,good game
26164,"I want to preface this with  ""I love this game and am always looking out for new updates"" so the following won't feel like hate.
This game won't wow you with its clean movements, combat, or story. A lot of the movements feel sluggish, most enemies feel the same and need to be ""cheesed"" in order to be dealt with, and the story feels a bit hand wavy. This is keeping in mind that the game is in early access and only being mentioned because of how much potential and love I am already seeing in the game.  It's unique, it's fun with friends, the crafting is nice, more variety to islands arrives with each update, and it just feels like a wholesomely fun game. Highly recommended, even in early access."
26165,"GOOD GAME,me likee plees continue"
26166,Its a relaxing surviver game
26167,It's all fun and games until the shark eats your entire 2x2 raft and your stranded on an island
26168,
26169,Game is good very much
26170,"This game is so addicting, adventurous, and exciting. I definitely recommend this game to players that like open-world exploration games. But always keep a good eye out for a shark."
26171,this game iss sp good it makes mee want to live even tho i hate them mutated rats amd the receiver gtktiches out sometimes but nevertheless this game is heavenly i love the people the shark the boat i love it its so good i recommmend to my mom dad grandma grandpa all of them i think this gam needs an award for just amazing
26172,"I've had a ton of fun with this game. I love the constant work you have to put in, as well as how much you can customize your raft as you float along on the great blue ocean."

26180,lov it
26181,If you enjoy building and exploring this is a very fun game! Especially with a friend! 26 hours in and haven't beaten the game yet. It can get lonely on the open seas sometimes if you're playing solo.
26182,cool
26183,veru fun survival game!
26184,"good.

26185,Good survival game for both solo and coop gameplay
26186,i like evrything in this game is so fun
26187,"When i play this game, I recommend friends! Food and water become very dependent ur attention. When u are with a friend one can be fighting the shark off while you are making water and food. In single player, its hard initially but after u unlock metal things gets really easy! Recommend for fun and adventure, very easily addictive (requires friends)"
26188,"GG

26189,fun
26190,It was not fun. One dimensional game. I'm  sure its better late game but its not fun or worth it the first few hours in. Dont want to put in 30-40 hours in to eventually get to a good part. Only concept is just make sure you live! Not worth the $20 dollars maybe more like $5.
26191,Very interesting game
26192,"give it some time, it gets better and better"

26216,"This is a game that I saw a few years back after it was released and I immediately wanted to play it. Now that I finally can, I love it even more. I don't have a beefy PC, I am actually using a cheap-ish laptop that is just under the recommended specs to run this game but its still enjoyable.

The only thing I dislike about Raft is that the Creative mode is a little lacking in features."

i really didn't think i would find this all that fun because its just a raft in the middle of the ocean but somehow its still super fun to play.
pretty funny way i found out about the game too (let's game it out).
still learning how to build up my raft the right way and how to sort things out but even that's fun.
still pretty crazy that its not even 100% finished and im already really into the game."

26230,"Edit: with the 1.0 release story is now complete and I enjoyed it immensely.


Finished the current story content on co-op. Definitely a top survival-open world game. At the start you die a lot and get a bit hardship but as you play things get easier and easier then you go do story line which was so fun. There is still good amount to as to get the raft bigger and more cool looking with proper auto/self parts. Looking forward for more updates to come. Great job devs. If the game is on sale and you like open world-survival I think its a crime to not to play this game."
26231,nice
26232,I very fun game to play with friends. It's pretty good by yourself but a blast with others. I love the game
26233,"Single Player sucks, but fun with friends"
26234,"The game is very fun and runs smoothly. Thoroughly enjoy the quest line and the puzzle-like content structure.

One recommendation I have is that the game would greatly improve with the reworking of inventory/storage management. Would love to see an auto-sort feature for the backpack/storage as well as adding a custom stack slitting option instead of just half stack split.

If you're a fan of chill building and survival games, I definitely recommend picking up Raft."
26235,its a good game
26236,I like fishing
26237,"i've got de thalassophobia but playing with ma boi helped with the mental seizures:) Tho didn't realise story was over so spent extra 50 hours looking for more content sheesh.

also you can't jump in mid gameplay cuz u won't get the achievements;("

26255,"Raft is a incredibly peaceful and love filled survival game where everything including story progression, crafting, base-building, and survival elements in general all blend together seamlessly, I would highly recommend this game with a loved one or companion, tons of fun to be had!"
26256,gerat game
26257,The inclusion of the wet brick is phenomenal.
26258,"I really like this game because I can make different kinds of raft structure each play through. I just don't like the part were we needed to go deeper in the water. Made me hyperventilate and reminded me so much of the time when I was playing Subnautica. (Finished that game but with the cost of increasing my fear of large bodies of water) I also don't like the part were the water is going inside the raft to the point where the raft is completely underwater for a few seconds. It's scaryyyy

Anyways if possible, please re-check the assets like the display trees, and flowers on some islands because some of them are floating above the ground. There are also trees with no colliders. (players can pass through it) 

I also encountered some glitches during my multiplayer game play like the following
-Paint brush would be working but after a few minutes it would stop. The paint brush wouldn't show any preview and it won't allow me to paint. Restarting the game also doesn't help. I would just be lucky sometimes that the paint brush would mysteriously work. 
-There was a goat that I couldn't catch because it was walking in place. The net would just go pass through it as if the goat wasn't there. 
-Our raft was huge and I was in the center part of it when a huge wave swallowed the raft. I didn't move nor did I press anything but my character ended up under the raft and being attacked by the shark. 
-I open a storage box to get some items and when I closed it the box remained open. I couldn't open it again nor destroy it. It was stuck and we had to restart the game. On the 2nd restart of the game, the storage box was usable again. 
-When I place a chair/sofa near a wall and seat on it, I usually get stuck when between the wall and the chair when I made my character stand up. I would sometimes need to destroy the chair to be able to move again. Sometimes I would jump repeatedly until my character jitters to go on the other side of the wall. 

-This isn't a glitch but I'm not sure if it's just on my end or if I'm doing something wrong but I can't make the character sprint and then jump. When I hold shift and then space bar to jump, the character would end up ignoring the jump command. What I do instead is I hold down the shift key and when I'm about to jump I have to let go of the shift and then press space bar. Sometimes it would work but mostly it wouldn't. It makes it a little hard to go to some places and on my play through I ended up depending on my team mate to explore further on areas I couldn't jump on to. 

I hope in the later development of this game, players would be allowed to loot more items on islands. More items to build and decorations for the raft. Maybe players can interact with the dolphins, turtles, whales, and manta rays? More animals to capture, and plants to grow. 

You guys are doing great and I can't wait for more updates!



-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


Hi! I went back and play the game now that the final chapter is out. 

I now get how to sprint jump. I didn't notice that I can just press shift once and then it would automatically let my player sprint. 

We've encountered new bugs. Before the release of the final chapter, my boyfriend and I had a lot of animals on the raft. We added a fence around them so that they won't get away. The problem is that ever since the new update, our Cluckers have been escaping the fence. Sadly we lost 2 of them. So we trapped them in a room instead.

There was also this one bug where all of the items were displaying wrong numbers of total item. I picked up 20 wood, and the UI showed I had 350 on my inventory. 

By the way we also like the changes in the UI, especially when you go underwater. The timer is much noticeable now. We also like the newly added shop. We bought a lot of the items there. I was expecting for the wardrobe to allow players to change clothes not just the color and pattern of what they are currently wearing but it's good as it is. 

Also we wish that for the bowl and the glass used for the smoothies, would be permanent like the water bottle and cup. It's kinda weird that they can only be used once. Do they eat the container? Or throw it out on the ocean?"

26342,Fun game. Love to just sail around.
26343,It is a pog game for getting killed by sharks and build a boat. You can be women wich I find very epic and it even has ginourmous melons. Especially for kids it is very good for teaching the life on a stranded boat. But sadly it doesn't have drugs in the game.

- Open world
- Survival
- A good and interesting story
- Crafting
- Feeling of progression

I find it to be one of the best games I have played in the last few years, within the first hour of gameplay you'll be hooked!"
26354,legalzin
26355,good
26356,"It's an okay game, but I don't know if it is still needing more content or what the Devs are doing with it. 

You start out on a 2x2 raft with a hook, and nothing else. You have to survive despite a shark in the water that constantly harasses you, the lack of proper food and water readily available at first, There is a steep learning curve and a counter-intuitive research method. 

The lack of a true end goal is still a problem for this game, but I've seen some players create some pretty interesting rafts for their survival. Add to that the fact that, while slow, the Devs do appear to be actively working on this game, I'm hopeful for the future of this game. It is a bit buggy, with occasional crashes, but nothing consistent.

Overall, 7/10 recommended game if you're bored of Conan or Ark style survival.

Note: The Shark will bite you if you let it, don't do that."
26357,"Raft great fun playing with friends.

Its a cool idea about the chapters but was annoying when you play it a lot then there is nothing else to do. but me and my friends have a great time in this game, and can't wait for the next chapters. 

If you want a fun co op game to play get Raft you will not be disappointed. : )"
26358,Amazing survival game with a good challenge and interesting story
26359,"Pretty fun with another player if you cheese it! There are some death mechanics that we found to be pretty unfair, such as all items on your person disappear in the void when you die. Turning that feature off made the game much more manageable. 

The crafting was fun, though we did start to get bored with the repetitiveness. The over-arching story line helps it a lot with bringing an overall goal and destination in mind. Combat and animations could use some polish, but the crafting and building system are pretty on point, as the bread and butter of the whole game."
26360,good game
26361,"Absolutely love this game however just a few points

1.if you die on normal you lose everything in your inventory even if you die inches from your raft i think this is overly harsh you should be able to recover your loot some way
2 screechers(aka vulture/condors) are to strong either need to add a stamina bar and increase sprint speed to make it fair even running full pelt i get his 50% of the time also the boulders should collide with raft structures not go right through
3.more advancement stuff would be amazing like being able to smelt down 5 scrap into a metal ingot other than just ore

also wanting to recover your body is not wanting easy mode but if i lost all my tools that take hours to build up and i litteraly die next to my raft on the beach i should be able to walk and get it. 

But to the devs i cant wait to see what else is coming keep up the good work."
26362,hehehe shark head go brrrrrrrrr
26363,"This game is incredible, frustrating at times, confusing, but one thing I love is a normal non brilliant person can actually figure out almost all the puzzles in this game

26364,very fun and good with friends
26365,"After being stranded in the ocean for many a day, a great white shark begin to circle the tiny raft which held me just out of its reach. Days and days went by, and soon my raft had grown in size. The shark, ever persistent, continued. I formed a bond with the shark, having been the only living thing I had seen in my travels. I named him Bruce. Overall Bruce was a pretty cool dude. 5/5, mainly cause of Bruce"

26396,fun game
26397,good
26398,i have allways wanted a game wen you can build your own Raft! and in creative i have buildt a Mega Yacht
26399,pretty well
26400,"pretty good of a game but i cant be bothered to write a revow
"
26401,"Game is fun overall, just a little buggy at times (guess that's what you get with a $20 game). Isn't the most polished, but definitely a fun survival concept with seemingly endless customization possibilities for your raft. My main complaint with the game is how the raft often times floats through the islands you're trying to explore. So if you don't get your anchor down in time, the raft will glitch right through the base of the island and will continue floating through the other side as if it were on water the entire time. Very difficult to catch up to your raft that continues to flow THROUGH land when you become hungry and cannot sprint to it so you lose it and all your things on you since you're unable to recover your inventory when you die. Definitely some QoL improvements to be made but overall a decent game. 

3.5/5 Game"
26402,"Very fun
:)"
26403,thought it would jus be the boring raft game i remembered it being but this games story just unfolds in front of you and you explore new environments and overcome different obstacles. REALLY WORTH IT!!!! Cant wait for the new chapter.

"
26411,Pretty fun and love the customizing options! It can get pretty slow paced sometimes though
26412,"10/10, money well spent. Only gripe is while updates are great, it's vastly overshadowed by the time between them. The game relies on subsequent development which seems to take substantial time. If only starting a 'new game' meant getting to experience it for the first time all over again. Solo is relaxing, co-op is just downright fun. Given the delay between updates, this is one I definitely wish I could start over from the beginning.  I would be more than happy to pay for a full/non-early-access iterant if it meant that updates would be released more regularly."
26413,i made very big zipline. fun game.
26414,"Pretty impressed so far, and looking forward to seeing where they take the story.  I like being able to build my own raft and scavenge for survival.  I've always liked survival stories so being able to live one out in a game is the next best thing."
26415,preaty col i payed a lot and have a fun tim
26416,Its fun. Building i cool. It calming. Shark f's you up if you dont watch it. Great game.
26417,10/10 would bang this game again
26418,This game runs very poorly and may even break your computer. -1000/10
26419,i be playin raft
26420,"This game is a ton of fun, it can be super chill and its rewarding to play through.

Really, my issues with the game come from everything since I've completed the game. As with any survival game, they exist and thrive off regular content releases. At the time of writing this Update 13 was released about 7 months ago, and Update 12 was released 8 months prior to that. Update 11 was 8 months prior to that. The updates can be rather swiftly completed, and personally for me I feel like the amount of time I'm getting out of the updates versus how much time the devs spend on them aren't really making much sense.

I've been mostly disappointed with the progression of development for this game. We're coming up soon on it's 4th anniversary since release on steam and it's still in Early Access with absolutely no hope in sight for an actual 1.0 release.

Raft saw really massive success early on, an unexpected amount for the devs. Since then they haven't hired much and with a small 8 person team are still currently not actively hiring. As someone who bought the game early and has enjoyed it immensely. The last couple years of very slow updates and lack of content has left me kind of jaded towards the game which makes me sad.

All of that being said, if you purchase the game and play through what is available, you will have a great time and really enjoy yourself especially for the price you pay for the game. It's very good, and very fun. That being said, once you complete it, you can join me in the waiting area, hoping for more content for the rest of forever."

26478,Fun game
26479,This game is really fun! I played the entire campaign with a friend and we recently finished the game at 20+ hours. Granted two people means double the resources but it was worth it. I highly recommend this game if you and a friend are looking for something to play together for a while or even to play solo! We'll keep upgrading our raft and equipment in the mean time as we get excited for new content!
26480,worth it with the BOISS
26481,Extremely fun to do with friends or just a duo. Solo its less fun. But thats with most of the games. I would a 100% recommend this because you have a lot of things to discover and you have a fun adventure and not enough wood.

26498,"Played both solo and with friends. I can say that both experience is good. The only problem I have now is I don't have anything left to do after the last story island. In dire need of more content. Would still recommend this game. The experience was really good and I need more. 

In multiplayer I get this lag where I could not get the timing to hit the shark using a spear. I could do it with ease when playing solo but when I join my friend's game, the timing gets messed up because of lag I guess, not sure. [spoiler] Just use bow lol.  [/spoiler]"

26508,7.8/10 - Too much water.
26509,epic
26510,Yea i bet
26511,Fun
26512,"Ive played this game for over 700 hours. its decent overall, its not very hard with the way the metal reinforcements work, but in contrast to 50 sharks... i dunno i feel like its a wonky balance for players like me. its like i have to either bait the shark or if i kill it the game punishes me but i can get around it in ever increasing and more silly ass ways. Me and my brother are talking about doing a stream where we try to get as many sharks to spawn as possible. 

That mechanic is wacky imo, the sharks should really come and go and not just be wolves that circle you forever. i mean if you bait them and swim away thats one thing. if you are say bleeding in the water that would attract more sharks? that would makes sense. Just a few observations. If the devs are interested in chatting feel free to hit me up."
26513,"Awesome game, it gets a bit laggy with laptop but with fixing the settings its really managable! Great game :D"
26514,fun to play with friends and great along good to chill on.
26515,Shark
26516,"Pros: The adventure component of Raft is extremely addictive. For whatever reason, I want to unlock everything and expand what I can. I do like feeling like I have to always be going somewhere, otherwise it would be boring to be stationary - since resources are not ample and stationary. It is very easy to understand what to do next.

Cons: The combat mechanics are silly, the game is mostly gathering. The most you'll fight is the boar, which funnily enough I was able to glitch between the raft and the island so it was an easy kill. Using the bow and arrow is a bit inconvenient as well, but that's not the premise of the game in my understanding.

Indifferent: I have yet to mess with the creativity features outside of creative mode. They're nice, but hard to admire without the work in that mode.

Can't wait to see where this game goes."
26517,A fun survival game! A bit more easier/safer then other survival games
26518,best best worth much fun repeat more fun

26532,it is fun with frends
26533,Great game with amazing music it could use a bit more work on the sound design tho
26534,"like subnautica, except worse cause now you have to imagine the creatures swimming under you."

26589,"For a survival game, I found this one really easy to jump into and learn. It's simple to pick up and build at first and advances at a good pace. Like other survival games, it's easier with friends. Someone can build and organize your raft, another get and cook food, while another searches for supplies. It's also very relaxing at times to just be floating in game on a raft. Story progresses as you find information on islands and unlock locations to sail to."

26615,It is a fun game that includes survival. It is awesome that it is multiplayer and that materials are always able to be found and you can never fully run out of them.
26616,YES.
26617,Extremely buggy and multiplayer is almost unplayable.
26618,this game is fun i just wish you could change the difficulty of a save without having to start new
26619,fucking sucks
26620,Game is fun for the first few islands then the game becomes a walking sim with bars you must fill up with tools the break after using them for ten minutes. I feel like this is a good game for people that like Death Stranding sponsored by monster™
26621,"First few islands are cool, decent base game mechanics for a survival game. But its all fun and games until you get to caravan island. Either just dont go or uninstall at that point. Turns into a walking sim and the worst fetch quest I have ever seen."
26622,Good Game
26623,best game ever
26624,"fuck the shark

My thoughts? 
☑ Story line is fun as there are some creative puzzles on islands that are different from your normal spawn islands. Beyond the game play though, it can get a bit dry but hey, your imagination is limitless!
☑ Crafting is realistic and easy to learn.
☑ Graphics and sound is pretty good.
☐ Spawn for trash should align with the amount of foundations or resources used for the raft or else it will be a very loooong grind if you're planning to have a big build (like me)... :)
☐ More automation would be appreciated, but I think as new chapters get added, perhaps there will be. 
☐ Increasing the amount of collectables and/or decorations would make the game more hands-on with more variety.
☐ Increasing the wildlife that you can capture and/or hunt would also make the game more enjoyable instead of hunting and capturing the same animals.

A lot of these are me just being nit-picky..... and after spending countless hours playing this game, it's still 10/10 in my books and worth the grind when you get to see your amazing designs play out."
26630,"i love this game so MUCH 
you should play this"

26642,shark ate boaz
26643,love it
26644,Super game to play with friends!!
26645,"this is an awsome game.
in the game you are stuck on a raft
you have to servive on the junk you find in the ocean
find islands,
and follow a story
I wouldnt recomend it for new gamers because there is no tutorial
but otherwise its an amazing game
with good grafics"
26646,"while normal and hard mode can be very stressful for a single player, its a ton of fun for CoOp. creative is a ton of fun to experiment and create massive rafts. Easy mode is very relaxing once you get past the basics of survival. I would float for hours just gathering items in order to tweak and beautify my raft (which ended up looking more like a tugboat than anything.) 

 The vast empty ocean becomes calming, its a new escape and blank canvas of exploration, you strain to see new islands in the distance and coax your raft to head towards it hoping for food, wood, and resources to expand the raft

the shark can be quite irritating and respawns a little too quickly sometimes, the other hostile mobs are easy enough to deal with. im hoping with the next update you can get a few more weapons as well as add new tools and physics for the raft."
26647,This is a fun game to play either alone or with family and friends. I love the creative mode so that you can build whatever type of raft/vessel as you want and there are some animals included as well. I would recommend this game for anyone who has an explorer side to them.

26654,don't drink salt water and always have some plastic and planks with you. what would we ever do without ocean litter/garbage??? would make raft unplayable (/s)
26655,"I love this game! I is sooo fun! 1000% recommend
"
26656,I enjoy this game because you start out on a raft and then you get stuff floating in the ocean. I think that this game is trying to hint that there is too much pollution in the ocean and that we need to chasnge our ways. But I also think that it is trying to say that we should litter because then we let people who are floating in a raft gather resources to eventually become a tril;lionare.
26657,yes
26658,good game :)

26664,i love it so yah
26665,"Game doesn't let you build a new raft no matter what, wasn't aware of this, went onto a nearby island whilst my raft floated away thinking I could make a new one. Turns out the world is also stored local to your raft, so if you let it float away things will despawn, even if you're on an island it'll despawn after a few minutes.

Seems like this has several years left of development to be honest, such a simple feature of creating another raft just isn't supported."

- Water / Food depletes way too fast.
- Combat is wack
- Shark attacks the boat too often and eat the boat too fast. 
- Puzzles with key items that only spawn after a certain objective, so you have to search the whole island you JUST finished searching for the first part
- Anti-climatic ending (work in progress)"

26735,"Genuinely a lot of fun. If you have a few friends (not saying you cant play single player [its fun too] and a creative mind you will have a blast. Really like having developers that clearly care about the game + the community. It felt a bit shallow at first when it came out and now with all the new updates and things it is a full blown game. It is early access so I kind of expected it to be a bit half-baked, but it has definitely improved a lot. I'm just rambling. Go buy it!"

The island disappears after a couple of minutes and suddenly I'm floating doomed in the middle of the ocean. I then read online that this is an intended mechanic. It would be one thing if the game informed me beforehand that I couldn't abandon my raft, but it didn't. I'm not interested in investing a bunch of time in this game only to stumble on some other unintuitive game-ending mechanic. I'm also not interested in looking up spoilers online in order to play the game properly."

Atmosphere and art style are so dope, gameplay is smooth and responsive, quick and easy but has some cool intricacies. I would definitely recommend playing with a homie, just makes the experience way more enjoyable but regardless this game is great. Enjoying it a lot so far, will probably put another 15-30 hours in soon. Definitely worth the sale price."

This game is a bit of a cross of Minecraft in a Waterworld style world. The music makes this game calm and enjoyable to play. The gameplay is just enough to be sandbox while still providing some kind of goals and objectives to keep you moving towards some kind of goal.

Definitely worth a play."

26805,"I've been holding off reviewing this game since it has changed so much since day 1, but it has gone from a bare bones raft simulator to a pretty robust game so I figured now is as good a time as any.

If you are looking for a nice relaxing game where you can build your own floating vacation home then consider Raft, but if you are looking for a challenging survival game maybe take a pass on it.  

The difficulty and challenge disappears after the first half hour and soon you will have a totally self sufficient, indestructible boat.  The first few minutes can be tense when you are struggling to get food and water and to protect your tiny raft from shark attacks while on the verge of starvation, but that just doesn't last.   There are threats from hostile animals, but you can easily dodge or interrupt almost every attack, which makes the encounters more like time sinks and resource drains than a real challenge.  Sharks quickly go from your nemesis to an infinite food source, and before long you are tossing materials rather than hunting for them while gorging yourself of shark steaks and grilled seagull. 

All of that being said, it is a very nice relaxing way to unwind which is a big part of why I recommend it.

The game is also relatively bug free at this point which is something that really sets it apart from similar games."

Everything in this game is self explanatory and easy to progress in the story with simply doing what you've been doing since the start, aka collecting resources. Disclaimer though, the game is not completely finished as they keep adding to the story with ""specialized islands"" to the game but this shouldn't stop you from buying this. Has enough content to last about 20+ hours to reach the current ""end"" of the game and the game keeps receiving updates here and there (check their discord for more information). Definitely buy this game with your friends to have a good joy ride on your own raft."

26838,its good fun in my book
26839,GAY BATMAN MAKES ME PP HARD
26840, pretty good but repetetive if you are playing alone
26841,"yes, chop tree, raft, island, bird"
26842,"Slow to start, but, lots to do. The story islands are fun, different jump puzzles to do and items to find in order to increase the items you can create and decorate with. Also, blueprints to upgrade your boat, such as engines, water purifiers and more. There are also a lot of different sizes of resource islands to gather crafting items from. 
Would highly recommend"
26843,best game no cap not even trolling
26844,"good game fun game, piss my pants i saw shark and whale"
26845,"this game is so good with friends, this is is a masterpiece that is still in its work! i would recommend this to anyone that is browsing the store for any new games to pick up and have fun. the multiplayer is yet the funnest mode to play and interesting as you progress through the story, there is land marks and items you can get from killing or crafting stuff, though i do think the mechanics can be a little wacky and there are some glitches like placing a chest on a wall and them breaking the wall deletes the items but those can be fixed in later patches thanks for reading this and i would totally recommend this"

26879,This game is super fun and interesting and me and my friends have made a new world and we had a blast. I love the story in this game and I doesn't get boring at all. There are so many items to get and explore with. there are also so many ways you can make your raft having a resource gathering raft or a fancy mansion it is all up to you. i would give this game a 8.5/10 and would really recommend.

26904,really fun to play it seems id rec this to anyone who likes survival games kinda hard to keep up with engins and smelters very fun tho
26905,"I love playing this game with my wife. Probably won't play this game by myself too often though.

Multiplayer has terrible lag, despite having decent internet (200mbps download/6mbps upload), us sitting next to each other, and having computers exceeding the suggested specs. We had to set up a virtual LAN to get multiplayer to be playable.

The game starts out fairly difficult, you start with little resources and are 2 shark attacks from having your raft destroyed. The food items you find while floating on the open ocean aren't necessarily the best ones to be eating in early game which might make it feel grind-y in the beginning. You do have the resources to get better food. Crafting is king and understanding that is key to beating the learning curve, which holds true for all of the games I've played in this genre. 

I'm ~16hrs in and feel like we might have just entered into mid-game. Can't wait to see what's next!"
26906,amazing game
26907,EPOK
26908,"Very cool game to play with friends its funny it has very good mechanics and strocture of the entire map(game).
I like it the most because you have so much things to do like craft stuff, explore the map and you need to pay attention to the angry shark that will attack you and your base.

26931,
26932,"I haven't played in a while, but figured I'd write a review. Overall, it's really fun. I never finished since I got softlocked right before making it to the city thing. Good game though, I'm sure the bug that softlocked me has been fixed by now, and other than that the game was really smooth and overall worth it. I wasn't really expecting to enjoy it as much as I did."

26934,shark bad
26935,"I've lived a long, calm, and ordinary life. Once I went on a damn raft with a couple friends, my whole life changed. I've never been laughing my ass off so much when I see my friends screw around over stupid stuff. The puffer fish head gives me nightmares. The story leaves you asking more. I overall really enjoy this game. I love pushing people off the boat. This game rocks. Everyone should give this game a classic try if they have a friend has it. It's really good only on multiplayer though."
26936,good
26937,This game is very good with friends and solo too!
26938,I am so fucking pist man i spent money for absolutely nothing the minute i start the game its starts to glitch and when i try to look around its so fucking slow and not to mention the game crashed twice in a row! And just to be sure that it worked and it was just a minor glitch i waited until the next day . But here i am the game still glitchy as ever fuck u steam and the creators of raft!
26939,good game
26940,"What a great game. I have played a lot of different survival games like Ark, Atlas, 7 Days to Die and many others.. This is a very fun concept and its also simple at the same time. I am very excited to see what gets added later on in the game. For now I will continue to build my floating city!

26943,Tons of fun when with one other person or more! Love the game!
26944,"It's alright, certainly not the best survival game out there, kinda lame with the survival elements compared to a lot of other games (The Forest, Valheim, Don't Starve Together etc.), but it's fun with a friend if you want a less stressful chilly game with some cool building elements and stuff."

26948,It is the perfect game to play with friends or just play on your own. I havent gotten bored weith this game and when you start to be self sufficant its so good.

26953,no
26954,"This has to be one of my favourite games of all time, hands down. I have spent many hours drifting aimlessly building SHAMELESSLY large rafts while talking to Bruce, or exploring islands with my friends.

Normally when I review a game on steam that I enjoy, i just say 'It's very good, yes'. So if anything should convince you to buy this game, let it be the fact that I love this game so much I typed more than 4 words in the review box."
26955,very good :)
26956,good game
26957,yaaas
26958,"The game is fun but definitely needs some polishing. There are a few bugs that breaks the immersion that I hope to be fixed specially when using the hook. I don't find it enjoyable solo though, get some friends on your raft."
26959,"This is a great game indie survival game and the story is really interesting as well. Can't wait until they add more to it. If you are considering whether to buy it, just do it. It's a great game and well made."

26961,"(Hello everybody, my name is Sunny Lang and I uh
Created this cover of Green Day's ""Boulevard of Broken Dreams""
I call it ""I Walked to Burger King"")
I walked to Burger King
And then I walked back home from Burger King
Don't know where it goes
But I'm the only one and I walk alone
I forgot my car keys
At my minimum wage job at McDonalds
Just kidding I don't have a car
Fooled you again I actually have a car
I have a car, I have a car
(Did you hear that I had a car? I really have a car)
I have a car, and I have a-
I walk to Burger King for their Whopper
McDonalds has no good burgers
I forgot my car at my job
I forgot my car
(I really forgot my car at my job,
I can't believe I did that,
'Cause now I can't drive to Burger King and get myself a Whopper
Worst thing I've ever done, honestly)
I work at McDonalds
Serving burgers to fat people
(I honestly hate this job, I can't even sing this lyrically
I hate this job so much)
I always see a lot
Of fat people get stuck inside the door
When I try and help them
They just eat my hands and then I have no hands
I have no hands, and I have no hands
I wish I had some hands, and I wish I-
Didn't work at this stupid McDonalds
I wish the fat people would leave me alone
Just want Burger King it's all I ask for
I want a Whopper
(Honestly, we're almost at the end of the song,
And what I'm trying to get across is,
I don't like McDonalds, the fat people eat my arms)
I wish I had some hands to open the door
In go and get my Burger King
My body yearns for the taste of a Whopper
I just want some Burger King
(Honestly, I'm just tryna- I'm just-
I'm just tryna make you understand
That I want some Burger King,
Burger King is my favorite food, and I love it)
Why can't you understand that I want burgers
From Burger King 'cause they are really good
I just want a Whopper to satisfy me
I promise this is it"
26962,"I do not write reviews for video games, but this one is quite special. I have replayed this game a dozen times, and each time I revisit the cold depths of Raft's oceans, I feel a sense of revamped adventure that I can't describe, and no other game can pull out of me. Experience this game in its entirety, every nook a cranny has something beautiful within it.

-Shark can phase through islands to munch you or your pals
-Instructions for some endgame quests are really unclear and left us stumped for a while before we eventually just had to look up a guide
-Shark attack frequency is WAY too high
-Shark bait doesn't last long enough.  Let us make bait out of bigger fish or make it last longer.
-Dehydration/starvation sounds are EXTREMELY ANNOYING."
27000,"shark attack, i kill sharky warky"
27001,"First few runs of this game are fun, but its early game is super super boring. 
It has a great soundtrack, the late-game where you are just building a massive self sustaining raft is super enjoyable, but the early game (ESPECIALLY if you are playing with a friend or 2) are super super super tedious.

Not to mention completely losing runs to bugs is frustrating too (Like how the boars or whatever can do a 180 snap while charging up to 6 times from my experience, how touching a friend can cause them to get hit by the shark if the sharks under the raft, and many many more)

And there are some game breaking bugs that despite 4+ content updates have STILL not been patched.

If there more to do early game comes rather than just sitting around with a hook, and if some of these bugs are patched, ill likely change my review to positive, because it IS a good game, it just has a lot of issues that ruin it for me personally."
27002,Really fun to play with friends as it is chill yet fun.
27003,"This game is a great time, especially for the price. Most survival/craft games are either far too difficult and grinding, or way too easy, but Raft strikes a nice balance that kept me engaged for hours. I think the game's backstory and overall pacing gives it a unique identity, even when comparing it to more popular games like Subnautica or Rust. It was fun to speculate what happened leading up the game, and what we could discover next.

You spend most of the game just seeing where the waves take you, which means you're always on the move and finding something new. The process of building a raft is really fun because it's easy to imagine and create what YOU would want to live in if you were in that situation. After finishing the main quest up to the current update, I'm excited to see what may be coming next. 

I think this game would be fantastic to play on a larger server with lots of people. It's a game that's ripe with potential for role-play, which could easily lead to giant raft cities, fleets of rafts going to war, and so much more. I would also like to see more content outside of the main story line, as the game does lose of lot of its mystery and motivation after you go as far as you can. I wish that there was more to do on randomly generated islands, and that players had more variety in what they could build on their rafts (both practically and when it comes to decorations).  Despite this, I would say that this game is about an 8/10.

27013,very good
27014,Super fun
27015,Great game to play with a friend.
27016,Yes absolutely the building mechanics are fleshed out enough that you want to keep playing even when you reach the end of the game. You always unlock new gear which gives you new ways to upgrade your quality of life and become rich in a sense in things you need.
27017,fun
27018,This game is fun for two reasons. Its simple fun that you can take at your own pace and two. Its incredibly relaxing to just sit on a raft with calm music and fish out for food. This game can be played with friends which like most games makes it more fun but it is more chaotic and harder to keep 3 people alive as I have found. This game is a relaxing and fun experience for all.

27041,"Too slow for me. It takes to long to harvest things and my items degrade to quickly. I don't think flippers, oxygen tanks, and things like that should degrade at all. I barely get to use anything in the game before it breaks restarting the grind to make another one all over again.

The rats shouldn't respawn in the ship if I walk 15ft away. That's ridiculous. Got the engine but I think it's bugged out. It just baaaaarely rotates when switched on so I decided to move it to see if that was the problem but lost ALL my fuel when I moved it so I couldn't even use it! So I quit after that.

Crafting requires far to many resources for stuff in my opinion. I hate slowly moving from place to place to find things then quickly consume them to build something that just breaks in a few minutes of use. The shark is sooooo annoying. Killing it just respawns another one in a minute or so. I liked the threat at first but it got old really quickly. It's always there. I mean damn give me a damn break and let me have fun with the game. That's like if Subnautica had a Reaper just follow you the entire game. I wasn't even intimidated by it after a while. It's just a major annoyance and the only thing the shark serves is to slow you down even more. The core game play loop is to just lose all your materials to thirst, hunger, the stupid shark, killing enemies for menial rewards, and spending a lot of time replenishing. Stop giving me shark heads and boar heads after every kill. Damn that's annoying.

I played over 12 hours and never found out how to make a fucking backpack. Where do I get wool ffs?! I found the leather by killing a boar, killed an alpaca... Nope. Tried to sheer it... Nope. Never once saw a sheep if there is one. I can't even capture animals because I never found the gun powder. Maybe it was later in the game. But damn that's a dumb idea because you run out of space just on one supply crate. You can't even use things in your backpack so don't even bother setting up a hot bar because you'll be switching out items every few seconds to use them. You can't move chests either which sucks.

Building is a pain in the ass. The materials required to build is ridiculous. I grind for hours to get planks and plastic and use it in only about 5 minutes just making a wall around a small room. You can't move them once they are placed either. You have to destroy them and get half your materials back. EVERYTHING requires planks just about. I never have enough planks to build what I need. I have to grind for more planks all the damn time. Chopping trees is absolutely pointless. They give me maybe 5 planks and fill your inventory with crap I don't want and there are like 3-4 trees per island so wtf? My ax breaks quickly too.

I didn't bother growing anything. I thought growing fruit would be a good idea... Nope. The fruit doesn't even recover enough health to be worth it. Doesn't grow back either. Also harvesting doesn't always give seeds so I have to stop at yet another island to get seeds. I just started dropping them when I got them. Growing trees is probably the biggest waste of time. It's just like any tree. Chop it down to get wood and fruit. You can't harvest it and wait for new fruit. You have to chop the whole damn tree down you just spent 20 minutes waiting to grow to get 1 measly coconut that recovers a sliver of hunger and thirst.  Also it's not guaranteed to get seeds so don't waste your time.

The hunger mechanic sucks. It just sucks. My guy eats and entire shark and is STILL hungry after. Dude downs a shark, a cat fish, 20 potatoes, and about 12 steaks a day. I mean what the absolute fuck? Slow that down a bit. The water mechanic is much better balanced. I also love how often the fishing rods break... Even the metal ones.

I see this game was received well. At first I could see why. But I'm disappointed. I don't understand why this game has so many positive reviews. There is no game play here after 3 hours. I played to long to ask for a refund but I regret playing this for so long. Also the development is dead. Too much time is wasted gathering materials and almost everything is the game breaks after a few uses. Maybe if I could repair it before it broke to save one materials it would be better. More then likely I will never play it again. Just way to slow paced."
27042,good game and fun
27043,shark do be taking my wood

27094,"Contrary to what the game says, the multi-player/Co-op functionality isn't working. You can have multiple players in the game, but players other than the host CAN'T properly use their mouse buttons, or keyboard keys in-game."
27095,"Raft is a good time, hard to get going at first, but that makes it more rewarding when you get there. I wish you could collect items from your place of death on normal and hard. If you like survival games, definitely try this one."
27096,"This game at its heart tends to be really boring, If your looking to live on a raft in the middle of the ocean, you would not expect constant harassment by a shark. When you start there is no tutorial either so you have no idea how to get food or purify your water. All of which will help assist in your death multitudes of times. It takes some time also to realize that your materials like rope can be made from Leaves. The water movement is also very poor, your raft will never drift in more than one current. If you know oceans you should know how currents should work which this game does not even try to copy. Your raft will never go between two crosscurrents. Do not wast money on this game there are better titles than this that you can get for the same price as this game."
27097,I am addicted to this game and would 10/10 reccomend giving it a shot! just look out for ol Brucie

27115,"This game is fun for the average survival player, I love spending time building rafts and creating something while exploring the water filled world."
27116,"This is  great game, although i find it better to play with friends, 8/10"
27117,awful graphics and water physics but gameplay is fun and story not bad
27118,<3
27119,"It fails to bring something new to the classic open world survival genre, gets repetitive and tedious real quick."
27120,Fun game to play with your significant other!
27121,is like fortnite but like with shark and a boat
27122,Why update so long
27123,"As I drift through the ocean, allowing my raft to just collect debris used to build a bigger raft, I get a lot of time to think. Who am I? Where is my life going? I am the raft now. I go where the wind takes me. Also, sharks suck, dude. I just, like, wanna harvest some metal, dude. Chill.

It's a fun game. I'm having a good time. Better with friends."
27124,Much good. shark much evil always eat my bed. oh no seagulls. aaaaaaaaaaaaaasssssssssssssdfghjtresdfghgjmmnhbgvfcxsz muy buen. everttihng tasty mmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm :)
27125,"Might get boring as solo run, but really fun with friends.

Why negative review though? Game gets repetitive quite quickly.
The main driving force in playing this game is story, but it has a horrendous update gap.

So if you buy this game, have friends to play with you, and expect yourself to have a long hiatus after seeing the story."
27126,good kill shark and eat him name karen
27127,nice game
27128,love it
27129,7.8/10
27130,"Very good game to play with friends. Have some bugs, but it doesn't distract too much! 4/5*"
27131,good gme
27132,"Hm, this game still feels quite flat. It's not a bad game, just nothing exciting is going on in this game. It had quite an improvement over the years, when I first tried this game, but since then the core gameplay loop still is way more boring than it is in some other survival games. At least they implemented tons of decoration items, which some people may enjoy, but I personally can't get much excited for these. Visiting islands mostly feels the same so far, some flowers to collect, some trees to chop, some clay to dig, some animals to avoid or kill. Sometimes you will find containers, which is the highlight of the whole game.

Anyhow, I will still keep playing further, since I have no good alternatives right now to kill some time, but I highly doubt the final release will be something I would spent hundreds of hours into, like in some other survival games."
27133,"I may have only played this game for 1.5 hrs but I recommend it, it's really good my PC normally goes quite hot when I play it for a long period of time but I normally play it for intervals it's a great game and I recommend it to anyone with good enough PC specifications."
27134,very good... except for when a massive ass shark annihilates you

27145,good.
27146,"Raft is a fun game to play with friends. I personally don't like the shark, Bruce and I play on easy mode to avoid the annoyance of him but if you want more of a challenge leave him turned on. If you try to build too much on your raft you will have major performance issues. I love the build aspect and hope they add more build options in the future. It can grow tedious and boring after awhile of playing. I think the food and water status restrictions are too steep as you spend most of your time cooking and fishing. Over all i do love the game and the exploring islands aspect and hidden structures and cities make the game very appealing.  Definitely worth playing for low key relaxing game unless shark is on."
27147,yes

27182,fun asf but i need more updates
27183,"I'm sure this gets boring once you finish the story and finish major Raft upgrades, but that's a pretty lengthy process. The game is an interesting challenge, aesthetically pleasing, and really fun with friends. At this point in the updates, there's not much automation.  The game developers are attentive and do keep up with new content. Nice community"
27184,very fun and addicting but a bit of a grind but would reccomend
27185,"Incredibly fun (mostly) laid back game. Repetitive, in a good way, while also throwing in enough content so that you never feel bored. There is always something else to make, find, or explore. It adds just enough of a need for materials and survival needs that it keeps you on your toes with never a dull moment, but rarely feels like you're just farming for items as many survival games tend to become. Definitely better to play with friends though, as long as you get along well."

27197,"This game is seriously addictive. It's a combination of Minecraft and Breaths Edge. If you like those games, you should definitely try this one. It's exciting to play alone, but even more so with a friend or two. Try it out. It's worth the time and easy to learn. Watch out for that shark though. Its jump scared me more times than I can remember."

27219,I've played over 100 hours of this game and still have more to do! The Developers put out great updates often enough to keep things fresh and enjoyable. Raft is a really nice game to relax with or hop on with friends and goof off! As you keep playing you discover better ways to play and improve your raft as well as finding new features in general. The story that the games offers (but does not force you to follow) is really interesting and I'm looking forward to learning more about it in the next chapter release.
27220,very fun.

27241,"For months, I ignored this game, misjudging it as a cheap copy of Subnautica, but boy was I wrong. While Subnautica makes you go underwater, this keeps you on the surface!! The game keeps its Survival aspect very challenging, no thanks to that F*****G shark. It is a very fun game, takes sometime in getting used to. Once you get the mechanics, its ""easy sailing"" there after."

I started out on hard and actually worked myself downwards because how hard this game is I dont stream much and Id tell ya most streamers playing   this game are on easy. which brings me to the next my point I also am at that level. how is this game so real and fun.

27256,8/10
27257,"I like the game as it reminds me of Minecraft on a raft, the story line takes you through some fun places that work like a dungeon of sorts where you discover new items to craft, helpfull little hints on what to do or go next which gives you a good sense of progression.

Enjoyable in solo but its funnier with a friend.

Dont know how it works in a solo play, but with 2 players theres also a ""revive"" mechanic, in which a friend can go to your place of death to pick you up and get you to the nearest bed, so you can be revived, which also avoids loosing all the items you are carrying at the moment of your death.

8/10 at the moment of gameplay
"
27258,"Fuck this game, it is way too grindy, grind just for the sake of grind, you don't gain anything from it. Your character eats like a pig and drinks like an elephant. It is also really clunky. There is potential but it is wasted. Don't waste your time and money on this."

27292,"Progressing feels very rewarding, exploring and scavenging is fun but gets repetitive after a while, thankfully the emptiness is filled with chapters which upgrade your progress just enough to get you back to resource hunt again. Every chapter is unique and makes you want to go to the next one straight away. There are many ways to personalize your raft and make it feel like home. Get a friend or two, hop on and enjoy."

27314,"2022.7 Last edit:
The story is updated to the end, and... I think the ending is really lame. Classic antagonist, classic boss scene, classic ending scene, nothing really special or new. I always liked the earlier storytelling where you are the one exploring and putting every clue together, but the ending just falls back to a really mediocre story. One big big bad bad guy trying to change the world, and stopped ""just in time"" by our heroes who spent most of the time floating a raft on a sea in an apocalyptic world. Bravo, bravo.

New content update is also similar to the plot, good concept in the beginning but lame execution in late game updates. New non-cosmetic items require titanium everything, and do not do anything new apart from fulfilling the current job in a posh way. You like the grill using wood to burn? Good, take this electric-heating grill with batteries and larger capacity. Additional functions? Don't think about it. Plus, titanium can only be acquired through RNG mining, and you need to find many unexplored islands using a crap radar for that. So in conclusion, useless fancy things that can be totally ignored. 

Overall, the updates of this game reflects many similar indie games. Starting out with a cool concept, but gradually lost inspiration and direction when making it. It is lucky to see the 1.0 update of Raft, but I cannot say the long wait is worth it at all. The game is very likely reaching the end of major updates, so I maintain my stance that don't buy it if you seek long hours from it.


Original review:
TLDR: Don't buy it if you expect repeated runs for survival challenges; main motivations for playing this will be its story, which haven't been updated for more than a year.

Game is really fun for the first few 30 ish hours with friends, you will travel to different places to do main quests, see different islands with art styles and build new techs for your little raft. 

However, when the main questline is finished there isn't much to do. All you did is trying to expand your raft to survive so that you can explore the lore behind, but when you finished there isn't much challenge in terms of survival element and your raft lost direction to sail anywhere.

The devs are also rather slow on the updates. The last update about the quests is on Oct, 2020, which is a year and two months from now, and the next chapter is still nowhere to be seen. As a result, I would not recommend it if you want to grind out the survival element of it (because late game survival is brainless and boring). If you just want to have a few hours of fun with friends and move on, it is a good choice.

Leaving this a negative here just until the devs update the next chapter.

Edit:
People are mad at me because I leave a negative for a cheap early access game with 30 hours on record. Okay so here it goes:

1. I really want to leave a neutral here but there is no such thing on Steam. I ended up leave a negative so that people may see its flaws instead of seeing all the good sides of it.

2. Not many survival games are expensive. Consider Forest, Project Zomboid, The Long Dark, etc. You can easily get more hours from those for a similar price. Also, in my 30 hours I am always the host of the game so I go AFK a lot of the time and let my friends do the exploring.

3. Early access nowadays does not really mean anything, as anyone can easily slap an EA tag on the game and leave it in EA for years. Plus, I said in my review that I do not recommend it to players seeking to grind the survival element of it. It does not affect if you just want to buy it and have a few hours of fun."

There are some moments in the beginning that have you stumped as the game does not tell you too much of what to do but once you figure it out, it is very rewarding seeing hard work pay off."

27349,"I wanted to enjoy this game, and honestly gave it a good go, both solo and with friends. For the most part, it's a decent game, except for a few glaring issues that ruin the entire experience. First of all, the save on death feature is a joke. I died several times due to bugs or just weird no clip issues, and lost everything I had due to the devs rabid desire for, ""realism"" in a very unrealistic game. No loading back to when you last saved, (which must be done manually, no autosave) No. The game saves when you die, whether it's to a shark or your raft launching you into a mountain, and you lose your entire inventory. There is no way to get it back unless another player comes and rescues you, which completely ruins the point of a single player experience.

Also on the realism note, the food and water demands even on normal are *rediculous.* I wouldn't even mind if food an water was harder to get but lasted longer, because that would be infinitely preferable to having to CONSTANTLY eat and drink. I'm not even joking, the food and water loss rate is absolutely ludicrous, and you end up spending at least half your time just moving rapidly growing crops and watering them, then cooking the food to stay alive. If you're playing with multiple people, then someone is going to get saddled with doing literally nothing but feeding everyone else, and having an oh so fun time of being a potato farmer for many hours, and literally nothing else.

All in all, the game itself isn't too bad, but a few bad features ruin it in its entirety. A solid 5/10. As a big fan of survival and sandbox games, this one is just sub par."

27380,first save i accidently deleted lost three hours of my life that i'm not getting back left the game for like half a day then came back did a playthrough on easy and loved it relaxing taking care of you're raft and fishing this is really something you can just sit back and not worry about having to stress about managing storage all the time or lack of food it's easy in the best way possible just easy enough to make it feel like you are there and trying to make it out alive but not to easy to the point where it feels like you can just turn you're brain off while playing this is a really fun game overall i highly recommend
27381,"I bought the game played like an hour bored.
My gf told me she knows the game and we could play.
Told me it was gonna be fun, we will have fun.
Trying to catch some barrels i'm literally sniping the barrels, well let the fun begins.
She is getting agitated telling me ""you are way too good"" ""how the fuck did you get it"".
found and island accidently make a paddle.
she dropped off said she will be quick told me not to jump off.
paddle man starts to paddle like an autistic.
suddenly realize paddle is actually working.

27408,"it could be a great game, but i think it has some small but really important problems. 

a good game doesn't make players do repetitive tasks too many times. or at least it gives players a chance to automate those tasks. especially in crafting games, players should be able to craft something that automates those tasks, so that players can move on. for example collecting nets in this game are great. they give you an opportunity to automate the task of collecting garbage, which is normally boring after some time. 

but lets say you want to collect some clay underwater. first, you need to kill that shark. after you kill it (takes 5-10 mins) the new shark comes just after 3.5 minutes!! come on, devs! really?? you can collect just a little in that 3.5 minutes, then you need to do that about 10 times to get enough items to make a smelter. you also need to go find another island every 2 times, because the clay reserves deplete pretty fast. this whole collecting clay process needs to be WAY faster.  

also weapons and armor. it is really hard to make even the simplest armor in the game. and armors don't really help much. with the best armor set, you get something like 30 percent protection from damage. then why should we bother to make armor?  

weapons: there are basically 3 melee weapons with the damages 1, 2 and 3. and there is only one bow. the game needs more than this, come on. 

the game is still in early access. i would love to see this game getting better, i will gladly change my review if it does."
27409,in raft you eat shark shark not eat you
27410,"I'm a sucker for cartoon style games. 

If you enjoy Minecraft and some of the safer aspects of survival type games, you'll probably like this. It's a slow start and you'll need about 90 mins to really get up to speed and get in the flow but once you do it's ""minor grindy"" but not in any kind of bad way. It's another classic survival game that works best when you have 2 players as you get to work together and actually feel like you're working as a team. 

My wife is a hardcore FO76 player with over 1500 hours on that game ( I can't stand FO76! ) but she really liked the relaxed teamwork of The Raft and it was good for passing a rainy afternoon together, and for us to find a game we both agreed to co-op. I had played The Forrest previous and we got on OK but it was hard work even in easy mode, however The Raft was a much more sedate game. 

If you like the idea of survival games but find The Forest or RUST just way too much to handle, then you might enjoy this one due to the easy graphics style and the slightly more sedate gameplay. I put it on, put on the Solaris movie soundtrack and drifted about in a vast and empty ocean, pure bliss game play."

27412,Its fun

27414,amazing game best with friends. does take a lot of time to get things but it is fun while doing so. there is downsides like not having enough wood to make something and not being able to get wood.(speaking from experience) but all in all a great game!

27437,"I really enjoyed the survival aspect of this game, and was inspired to continue playing so that I could acquire the resources necessary to decorate (because we all know what is most important in life). HOWEVER, I did not expect for there to be a plot and the fact that there is one blew my mind and has given me a reason to continue playing as my friend and I work to uncover the mystery of the game. I hope there is more story to come!"

27466,"Well after some time the publisher has chosen to finish this game along with what very little of a plot, story, campaign whatever you want to call it which I will not spoil here but I will say does nothing to explain how you started on a 4 square raft with nothing in sight so no idea what community you were scouting for and has an ending that is so anticlimactic it was literally the worst ending they could have chosen possible. The zetans aliens in Fallout 3's DLC made waaaay more sense then the ending in this game.
Last thing I will say is the game started as an exploration/crafting experience which had some combat which you could even skip entirely by playing in peaceful mode, that is until the giant floating see-thru golf ball gets involved then the game loses everything it had been up to that point and becomes nothing more then obscure puzzles and combat.
So if you chose to go the peaceful route, your screwed, if you got the game for what it was before, crafting and exploring, your screwed, if you bought this game thinking its a combat game, your screwed and if you bought this game for puzzles, your screwed."

I do, however, wish there was a mode where you were in survival but had unlimited resources, since the creative mode doesn't allow you to actually play the game, just build what ever you want."

Will say that there is a quite a bit that the game doesn’t tell you outright so make sure you read item descriptions because there is a decent amount of information there.

27562,"haha funni raft go brrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr
"
27563,I LOVE IT!
27564,"This game was almost great. Almost. I enjoyed hooking things from my tiny raft, and I enjoyed building my raft out and watching it grow, all the while learning new things. That said, I like to play solo. I have an odd schedule, and I can't always play with other people. I shouldn't be punished for it. 

After the third time I died because of starving to death while soft-locked on a warthog's horns (no damage, but I can't escape or kill it), and being continually punished for that glitchy death by losing my entire inventory (since I like to play solo), I am compelled to downvote this. It's not ready - even ARK gives you the opportunity to recover your inventory after death. Make your game solo-friendly or fix the bugs that kill you for no reason. Until then, downvote."
27565,very good very fun whith freinds but i dont know what the lowest settings are so i put it to fastest settings very laggy but still fun when you pracrise
27566,"it's a nice game, there's a cool pet called Bruce and it's fun to play with him"

27569,"Okay it's very fun but for old PCs or laptops then you got to deal with A LOT of lag when others will be as smooth as a pancake and also the PvP does not work. but have fun with the game! PS if your looking at games by the same people who made this I like SM a little bit more do to it not being as not having that much lag. now have a good year! :)
"
27570,good
27571,very game and yes
27572,would buy again
27573,me and my friends bought the game a couple days ago i already have 20 hours of playtime this game is really fun to play with friends but its also fun in  single player and building in creative i recommend this game
27574,"Very simple not too confusing story line game.
The game doesn't feel too linear because of how much you can craft/do on your raft to improve.
Only downsides are probably the lack of customization for your character and repetitive chores you have to do ( getting water from filter, get passing items etc. ).
For anyone wondering you can play with as many people you want as long as your PC can host it and playing with friends just multiplicates the fun."
27575,"Still a bit rough around the edges, but the basic game play loop is very satisfying. Building is fun and straight forward and there are even a number of difficulty modes, so if you're more on the creative side and not big on survival elements you can tone those down. excited to see where the devs take this."
27576,"this is a good survival game, fun playing with friends"
27577,boat minecraft 20/10
27578,"I killed a shark, gave it to my friend, then I looted someones boat
Went home and bought Raft
Then I killed alot of animals
Then I downloaded raft"
27579,So far everything looks great easy UI and great system variations. The only hickup is the item respawn system after you die its sad to see to lose al those items.

27581,she good
27582,"very fun game, has the grinding experience yet it doesnt get annoying since you can always explore new things. Playing in  the gamemode peaceful gives you the experience of easier getting resources from the ocean and not having to worry about the shark, i personally often play on this gamemode since i always get so stressed otherwise. In general a pretty chill game :)"

27606,po
27607,A fun and simple game.
27608,yes
27609,"This game seems to have promise and I am writing this review after only about 2 hours of game play. There are a few things about this game that I do not like immediately. The food and water deplete too fast and even the cooked food which is supposed to give fill your bar more seems not to fill it enough. It feels like all I can do is worry about the food and water bars. As with a lot of survival games, inventory space is a concern and has to be managed well in order to survive. The stack size for items is too little at a measly 20. It also feels as if the items such as tools, wear out too fast. If you die in the game, you can respawn and will lose everything in your inventory (on your person). The issue I have with this feature is that you spawn with no hook and the only way to get materials to make another is to grab items as they float by close to your raft. BUT you start with half health and about one third food and water so chances are unless you socked some things away in storage containers, you'll die again from hunger or thirst before you can gather materials to make another hook. I see a lot of potential for the game and I do recommend this game for those of you who like survival games, but currently there are a lot of issues with game balancing that need to be fixed. I feel at the moment I'd only play the game with friends to allow for faster gathering and multitasking. Alone feels to overwhelming trying to watch food and water and shark. Forget even trying to explore under water by the islands or the islands themselves on my own."

27632,"Great mood, fun crafting and building-- I'm thoroughly enjoying this and I haven't even really begun the Chapters campaign!"
27633,wont let me refund
27634,Fun sanboxy type game. The story is actually pretty interesting and the building will drive you to push through it.
27635,.
27636,Its pretty fun. Its like sea of thieves and rust mixed. 100% recommend.
27637,"fun with friends. 

Update: With the final update finally released I can safely say that this game is a solid 8/10. It has an engaging enough story, interesting, if a bit shallow, survival aspects, and fun puzzles. This game as a whole is a great romp with friends. I will say that the complexity of the puzzles tends to ramp up in the later portions of the game, especially the pipe puzzle (if you know, you know)."

27644,"i was apart of the ""Raft Gang"" it going boring really fast, but its a fun sandbox"
27645,great game for just killing time and if you love discovering new items and always having to do something! you can ALWAYS be upgrading!
27646,GOOD KILL FISHE AND BUILD BOAT
27647,"played this awhile back, already loved it. My friend just got a PC so we jumped back on, new updates are amazing! Its almost like a whole new game. We will be putting a lot of hours on this winter for sure. I wish your basic food and water lasted a bit longer but I do know from my previous game once you cook recipes they do last quite long. I'll never give a game 10 out of 10 because anything can be improved but this is a solid 9 all day. If you like crafting and just having fun with friends, building this games amazing. The first hour is actually the hardest so don't get frustrated, ya might die a few times probably from thirst .
F.Y.I theres a lot more to the game than you might originally think. Keep researching new items and build them to really improve whats next.

One thing though DEVs, please add structured joists, beams so your beautiful rooms over  a few squares dont need pillars !"

A few minutes later, the resources around us despawned. We thought, “that’s weird” the following minutes ended up with the island despawning and us two having a heart attack. I have never left a game so quickly. Anyways, fun game."

The game is based on collecting resources from the ocean. there is no adventure, if you collect enough garbage from the ocean you may craft a chair but don't put it on the edge. sharks are eating plain wood and plastic."

27803,"I definitely would and do recommend this game to others, whether one plays alone or with friends, both are exceptionally enjoyable.

The ambiance is peaceful and when the music suddenly kicks in out of the blue, it's so satisfying and calming.

My only 'Cons' for this game are:
1. The game is time consuming and may be too slow paced for other's liking, plus the beginning can be tedious at first.
2. The controls for both Keyboard and Especially for Controller, are quite odd; I had to manually button map most of the controls for my controller due to how awkward and lacking the original controls were; there was literally no button to crouch.
3. There's a few bugs (Ex: Some settings don't save, so after every relaunch of the game you may have to toggle your settings again).

The game is definitely not perfect, but that's to be expected from most and most certainly from games that are still in development, the game is still very good all things considered.

Thanks for reading my review, I hope it was informative."
27804,"Created a gc called ""Raft Gang"". I died in game, and nobody else was with me. I called to them for help and not a minute later did they save me.

It's has nothing to do with survival to me, it's feels more like some weird type of casino when u just need some good luck with ingredients. I mean, don't get me wrong, i see a lot of potential in this game and all but... damn, i've never got so rough start (without any reason or sense) in any survival games before. I just don't feel the need to swim on this raft to boil some water and die while i want to craft a bucket to get this salt water.. etc... It's just not fun to me."

27837,the game is really good you have to wait alot which is kinda boring but it is also very hard maintaning all your resources keeping up with food well at least with alot of people and bosses are easy
27838,I love this game because of the thrilling adventure
27839,it is fun you are on a raft
27840,"its really good
"
27841,"Great for co-op, fun but grindy building mechanics, decent story, great for creativity."
27842,"This is one of those :neutral: reviews (wish Steam had that as an option)...

I don't want to say NO, because this game was a lot of fun to play with a friend.  However, the updates are beyond slow and the amount of content provided within them is pretty pathetic.

It's frustrating to see a game you know you would really like and sink a lot of hours into turn into this extremely slow development cycle where it's almost not worth keeping up with the game.  

When/if the next chapter (chapter 3?) gets released... I don't see any reason to return.  The amount of content simply won't justify it.  We need a LOT more stuff to make this game worth returning to."
27843,"Games pretty mid without friends. Alone its slow asf until you get started on the story, but its alright I guess."
27844,"its just a well made game and is a fun thing to do in your free time

27861," [h1] Okay, there is so much to say about this game, and all of those things are amazing.  [/h1]
Every game needs so many components to be said as a ""great game."" Raft has every single component and more. It is for people with simple, creative, wondrous, and all kinds of minds. Below are a few things that make Raft such a great game for anyone to play. 
[list]
    [*] Great graphics
    [*] Amazing, straight-forward plot line
    [*] Tons of options, settings, modes, and other customization options.
[/list]
That was my review so far of the game known as Raft. Check in soon for more amazing game updates!"
27862,Hook.
27863,this game too hard 8 hours and i can;t get antenna machine to work??
27864,"this game is an amazing survival expierience, it is definatly better played with friends (specifcally ones that have expierience playing the game) ."
27865,"Fun to play, I recommend playing with friends. You can build a house and then roleplay and marry them and have babies with them and divorce them and cry and commit suicide."
27866,the best game i have yet is really IS FUN I WILL RECOMEND YOU BUYING IT ITS AWESOME FOR YOUR SELF OR YOUR FRIENDS/FAMILY
27867,"Really fun and lots to do. The game is well made and worth the price. Only downside is a lack of story content, however that comes with time. I've finished the story and am replaying the game from scratch with friends. I'm keeping my eyes out for the next chapter release as what has been teased already is stuff to look forward to and open up raft once again. Worth buying and fun to play with friends."
27868,Amazing game <3

27870,good game fun
27871,my little brother loves this game so i will give it a positive review

27873,one of the best survival games ive played
27874,"I've played the first three chapters a couple different times because I very much enjoy that each experience is very different that the previous times.  I eagerly await chapter four and I'm sure I will be eagerly awaiting chapter five a few days after that.  The initial premise of the game is that you build a raft with the materials you acquire along your journey.  Additionally, there is a creative mode where you are supplied with endless amounts of materials and your imagination is set free to build anything you want. well, anything you can build with the supplied materials.  While waiting for the next chapter, I have utilized this feature as a great time waster,"
27875,"""I'm dying of thirst"" ""Does anyone have planks?"" ""WHO TOOK MY FOOD???"""
27876,"""This game has creativity and lots of creations and architectural designs, it's kind of like subnautica but way more fun with friends, this game is so much more fun to play with friends and would highly recommend."""
27877,i can fish.
27878,shark's kinda hot ngl (the bird's a whore tho)
27879,great game

27883," ver y la3eb game
"
27884,yes
27885,"Very fun to play with friends, however if you're just starting I recommend that you play on easy mode first so food isn't an issue. A good way to farm food is just to get a bow and kill the shark, or ""Bruce"" as he's been named by the developers. He drops 4 shark meat which is pretty good, and on easy mode he's easy to kill. It takes about 13 shots to kill him with stone arrows, but only 10 with metal arrows (again this is if you're killing him on easy mode). As he swims up to bite you, you can literally just let an arrow go and shoot him right in his mouth which not only stop his attack, but it'll also make him swim away by going underneath you. This gives you a brief opening to ready your bow and shoot him in the tail as he passes by you. Getting a fishing rod is a good way to stack up on food too, especially with a metal rod so you can get catfish and salmon."
27886,water
27887,it good its is
27888,its an alright game to take up a bit of time
27889,Love every minute of it !
27890,gud gam vry fun
27891,yes
27892,fun
27893,"Playing it with 2 friends on peaceful mode. 10/10 would recommend. Game is entertaining and provides a different experience depending the mode you choose and who you play it with.

13 hours in, we've focused on finding materials to build a nice raft (more of a boat at this point) and getting food. We've had plenty of opportunities to explore (and died a couple times due to ignoring our needs) and are ready to start the main story by going to Radio Tower."
27894,Bebebebebebebe boop
27895,"God I love this game, I rember when I was watching letsplays of raft when it was released and wanting it. played for around 4 hours yesterday w/ my friend and I can say that it was incredibly fun."
27896,you can slap your friends ass
27897,its good
27898,its a very good game to play with friends and also alone
27899,Its fun and is similar to Subnatica
27900,Y E S
27901,This game always makes me praying: Human!! throw more rubbish into the sea please!!
27902,"In Raft, often, do you craft
Sail across the sea with me, use my hook until i'm crook
Reel in some driftwood, kneel carefully when you grab it, as you should.
Plant a tree! Watch it grow with smelly glee
Stab a shark, then watch its eyes go dark.
Decorate with a mate! But do not postulate. 
Set sail! Like a pale old frail gail who graduated from yale and loves hay bales. 

Land ahoy! Ring the Bells! Sing with glee, sail away with me, and always remember: if it smells, it sells!"
27903,very fun to play with friends
27904,"I love this game, and if you could add like survivors on the abandoned rafts or on the large islands that would be amazing because singleplayer does get kinda lonely or you could always just add pets like wolfs or stary cats etc. but thank you for taking the time to read my comment. ;)"
27905,hehe hehe
27906,IT IS A GOOD GAME
27907,"lore bro, so much lore bro, no bro"

27912,"Survival and building, who could ask for more? I like that it's not overly stressful, the music is calm and relaxing."
27913,VERY GOOD BUT ITS ONLY FUN WITH MULTIPLAYER AND IT IS VERY FUN!!!
27914,Nice game but new new updates is super slow.
27915,Shak go nom
27916,This game basically makes Subnautica look like a big steaming pile of rubbish. This game is one of the best open world survival games ever. Big up the winter sale as I got this game for a whopping £10. Me and my friend love playing this game as it's therapeutic and we both love the ocean. I wish the shark could go away so we could swim like fish and see what's at the bottom of the ocean. I wish there were more animals in the sea like octopus and kelp and plankton and the beluga whale. Overall I give this game a 9/10 only because the birds keep dunking us with rocks which is rather unpleasant.
27917,"very good
"
27918,Such a great game. The art style is beautiful and story is mindblowingly good for a smaller game like this. The developers did a really good job on it and I am excited for the Chapter 3 update that is to hopefully come soon!
27919,it fun
27920,"If you care of your nerves, DON'T play this game in normal mode if you're a beginner. You need water.. but for that, you need a tool to make drinking water.. which requires a number of elements, which you'll only find into the water but the shark is waiting for you.. and food is quite hard to find, and you cannot cook.. so you die a lot, and you will lose everything which isn't in a box.. and then you get into a loop trying to find the stuff you need to survive and build boxes to avoid losing everything.. So playing in easy mode is the only way I've found to enjoy this game, leave Normal to the future if you really want to, once you're enough skilled to survive from day 0. Hard mode is nerve-racking, I mean this is a cool ""background"" game, hard is way, way too difficult as you'll not only lose everything, but you can't resurrect..  I've spent a ridiculous amount of time on this game now, and I think it's REALLY fun to play, I have a few points I would share if devs are reading this (most of these are sorted out via modding)
- When using the axe to destroy, all the item that are going to be removed should be highlighted (for example, if I'm targeting a pillar, also the platform it supports should be highlighted)
- Please give us a PAUSE working in multiplayer as well.
- The backpack is one of the most useful things given the limited slots we have without, but it's one of the last things we're able to build thanks to the research and the advanced materials (such as the wool) required. 
- Sleeping doesn't really do anything, raft isn't moving, food isn't cooking. The entire world is basically holding its breath until we get awake.
- The shark head should do something when you wear it, for example the shark might attack less frequently
- Cold/hot should have its own stats (as a bar), so that it makes sense building a shelter or wearing clothes
- Also strength should have its stat, at least in hard mode. For example swimming or walking doesn't affect the character at all. A bit like the oxygen bar.
- Roofs can't be built above pillars. It would be useful, ie at the end of a stair
- It would be great if one can build something small on the islands too, for example to sleep, drink or cook. I'm not really missing this as it would probably change the game's ""flavour"", but it would be useful on large islands.
- While working with the furnace, we should see when a plank is missing on cursor once the ingot is ready but is just missing a last plank: there's nothing showing it is missing, it just show ""X"" to take it so one could move it thinking it's empty
- A progress bar would be great while cooking or melting stuff
- Does the diary (T) have any use? I can see some object added, but it's not clear to me what's its purpose at the moment

After dropping graphics settings to a point that my pc could handle, (it's my trash hardware, nothing to do with the game.) we loaded into a shared world and began Gaming.  Despite having a slow start and a bit of an infuriating discussion on storage organization, we have managed to push through to the final island in the story (as of now) and we eagerly await the next installment of the story.  9/10 would play again."

28022,UU=====D
28023,Its's definitely a lot better as a co-op game to be honest. But it's a lot of fun and would recommend it. It reminds me a touch of building/creative games like Minecraft or subnautica but it's more narrow (i.e. no other worlds to explore) and has an overarching plot to follow (although it's still in development and coming out - only two chapters so far). But overall it's enjoyable.
28024,Started a new run recently and it just takes so hecking long to get stuff. like i just want to build in survival and play the story but it takes me 6 Hours to build a small raft and research a few things its just so annoying if you want to build something cool and enjoy the story.

28066,"Great game to play with friends or by yourself
"
28067,"Raft was gifted to me by a good friend, and honestly, that's the best way I could have discovered this game.
Both singleplayer and multiplayer are lots of fun. If you're familiar with Terraria or Minecraft, Raft follows the same basic methods of building and crafting, but employs the unique titular mechanic to make an experience all its own. If you enjoy either of those games, or ones like them, you'll like Raft.

In more detail: The primary goal is to survive on a small raft floating through a vast ocean, dotted with small islands. You have to deal with a shark which will constantly follow you and try to break your raft, and even if you stop on land for a while, you will need to keep moving around to get more resources, as the ocean is the only source of infinite resources in the game. With this in mind, Raft is ingenious in how it gets you engaged in the game and the cycle of gameplay; there's no true automation, which means you'll be constantly involved in the struggle to keep your raft from breaking and keep yourself fed. Not to say it's terribly hard - while I've only played in Easy mode so far, gaining resources is more fun than difficult. You can kill the shark and other enemies, but they will respawn after a short time. 
Raft does have a storyline, and I have not found it yet, but from what I understand, you're not supposed to follow it until you have a solid Raft constructed; one with enough food and resources to last you while you use the late-game items to navigate to the location of the story. Regardless, like Minecraft, you can definitely enjoy Raft even without that goal. If all you want to do is build a massive Raft mansion, there's nothing stopping you.
I haven't noticed any major glitches, and while sometimes joining worlds can prove a problem, the multiplayer is tons of fun as well. I've never had connection problems after the world was joined. The hook - the primary tool you'll be using throughout the game - will sometimes glitch a little when thrown, but it can be easily resolved by just flipping between two slots in your inventory and going back to it. With that in mind, it's a great experience and I'll probably be playing more of it in the future. 
TLDR: Great game with great mechanics. A bit rough around the edges, but core mechanics are ironclad and serve to be a great gaming experience alone or with friends."
28068,"nice
"
28069,Very fun would recommend

Really does fulfill the hunting and gathering aspect needed in my gaming life. The lore is pretty interesting as well.  :)"
28092,Played this with a friend while role playing as Jack and Rose from Titanic
28093,This is a really fun adveuntre game. You can play with your friends. The shark is annoying but soon he will be easy to kill.  The locations that you are sent are sick like a A place with ziplines a dome with robots with suits  and many more locations. I say buy this game because they will come with chapter 3 in the near futre

28096,its fun
28097,"SMOKERS!!!

Seriously though great game can't wait to see where it goes.
Finding packages with new decorations is great way to keep grabbing them barrels and making my raft cozy af.
Thriving while floating through a mystery that needs to be unravelled is just so nice and peaceful.
Even if that shark is making me paranoid. The worst creature in the game is the seagull!!"

28110,how is my character not morbidly obese with how much they need to eat
28111,"Spoiler Warning I am aware of early access 

This game is super fun up until after balboa island because by then (at least for me) you have the best stuff and there needs to be a faster progression than titanium because I had only found one peice of ore at the end of the game. plus i never ended up touching the bio fuel stuff because why would I .there is nothing very essential to get the reason I upgrade to the water wheals was because I did not want to deal with wind. a suggetion would be like make a machine that would ether essential or speed the process like the next location is very far away so you need a bio fuel engine to go fast enough or you need it because the shark got stronger after the island or something and make a consistent reason to get better stuff it encourges exploration and not just mindlessly going to the next location this review is just feedback I hope this will help the developers 

ps: i would like to add adio intead of reading this is a preferance because im lazy and i dont like reading"
28112,this game is so fun with freands not a lot alone and i was supprised how this game had a story and its so fun going through it there are a few glitches but is still really funn 8/10

28198,"TLDR: Short, repetitive, and boring.

Graphics:
It doesn't look bad at all, but everything looks the same. 

Storyline:
It's there, but it makes no sense. You travel between abandoned places and nothing is resolved by the end.

Price:
The price is horrible, should've been $5 max. Looking at other reviews, it looks like others would agree as most people have 8 to 10 hours of gameplay.

Difficulty:
Literally just collecting trash, not hard.

AI:
The only AI in the game just moves towards you. There is nothing impressive about it.

Cutscenes:
I don't think there was a single cutscene in the game,

Fun:
It's awesome first launching the game. You're presented with the world you've likely heard so much and watched so much about. Once you start playing, though, this awe wears off. You collect items, craft things to survive, and collect items. That's... it. I appreciate survival games, but there's nothing to this game and it's just so slow.

Sounds/Music:
Generic

Replayability:
Nope nope nope nope. I would never keep playing the survival mode, although I do occasionally hop into the sandbox mode to just mess around.

Controls:
There's nothing to complain about or praise. Just good.

Performance:
For some reason the game is extremely intensive, using more CPU and GPU with every single thing that you place down. Keep in mind I'm on an i7-7700 and GTX 1060 6gb.

Modding:
Not sure of any.

Selling Out:
The game comes whole, there are no additional purchases.

Similar Games:
Please just pick up something like Rust or Ark instead.

Bugs:
- Clipping models"

28226,good game epic play with friends twice the fun
28227,Love it
28228,I love spending 1 hour getting some materials than being eaten alive by a shark and having to restart everything. Best game ever.

28244,good
28245,noice
28246,no xbox or ps5 controls just keys  . really disappointed as was looking playing this but as disabled keysboard a little differcult to manage
28247,"I am still haunted by that one time I painted half of the raft an ugly pink color that did not match anything and my head hurt every single time I looked around. My friend was working hard during that time to make us advance in the game, but he did not expect us dying of nausea caused by the ugliest raft that ever roamed the ocean. RIP to all the fish still living with PTSD from what they have witnessed that day. I will forever carry my sins around."
28248,this game is very pog i would definitely recommend
28249,
28250,Really fun game to play with friends

28284,"This game is very nice, I enjoy playing it with my friends. However, there are some things that does bug me,
1, some of the animals like the shark or boar sometimes glitch through the map.
2. The some items are quite hard to make and sometimes it is hard to get resources.
One idea that would be nice is to allow stars in the night sky, I though it would be a good idea to navigate by the use of stars.
"
28285,its a very fun teamwork game you have to work together on surviving and collecting material to craft stuff. it is worth the money

28396,"1st try - Island on horizon, neat. Jump off, fell in a clearance between stones which teleported me onto empty ocean, no raft.
2nd try - Island on horizon, neat. Jump off, gather stuff. Turns out, you cannot start a new raft - old one floated away. My bad I guess.
3rd try - Island on horizon, neat. Managed to make a paddle to ""steer the raft"". Raft came ashore on a nice tiny beach. How will I get it off? No idea now but will figure it out later. Gather stuff, chop some trees. Shark came, bit off one side of raft and the whole thing vanished. At least I don't have to worry about getting it off the island.
All this within first 30-something minutes.
Maybe I should just pass by this damn island but if the very beginning of the game makes me restart a whole world after 10 minutes...I kinda don't feel like exploring more.
I understand the game is in Early Access but somehow until now I played plenty EA games and none made me restart whole world 3 times, maybe just my luck?
With that in mind - if I'm allowed to play, I'm allowed to comment and based on my experience: not worth it yet - refund."
28397,its fun but please make it in mac

28400,Really awesome game to play with friends. Minor bug and glitches hopefully the team can settle it. Otherwise really awesome game
28401,"Pretty enjoyable game, even though at first it seems it would get repetitive, it is not the case. All survival aspects blend well in the gameplay and the storyline just makes you wonder what is going on it that world.

The only downside i can see is that after you finish the storyline you have no real goal and the game loses its magic in a way. However still a great game to play solo / co-op."
28402,The game is a lot of fun and I am very much enjoying it my only complaint is my raft has got stuck on a island for what appears to be permanent thing other than that amazing game well worth the money.
28403,"literally- i love this game i would so play, i enjoyed it so much and the graphics are really good also. if you have a good pc depending on, you will lag if you dont have much of a good pc. if you do, i would so say play it!"
28404,It is very addicting and fun to play with friends.

28413,"Gramma Tala: In the beginning, there was only ocean until the mother island emerged: Te Fiti. Her heart held the greatest power ever known. It could create life itself. And Te Fiti shared it with the world. But in time, some begin to seek Te Fiti's heart. They believed that they could possess it, the great power of creation would be theirs. And one day, the most daring of them all voyaged across the vast ocean to take it. He was a Demigod of the wind and sea. He was a warrior. A trickster. A shapeshifter who could change form with the power of his magical fish hook. And his name was Maui. But without her heart, Te Fiti began to crumble, giving birth to a terrible darkness. Maui tried to escape, but was confronted by another who sought the heart: Te Kā, a demon of earth and fire. Maui was struck from the sky, never to be seen again. And his magical fish hook and the heart of Te Fiti, were lost to the sea. Where even now, 1000 years later, Te Kā and the demons of the deep still hunt for the heart, hiding in the darkness that will continue to spread, chasing away our fish, draining the life from island after island until every one of us is devoured by the bloodthirsty jaws of inescapable death! But one day, the heart will be found by someone who would journey beyond the reef, find Maui, deliver him across the great ocean to restore Te Fiti's heart and save us all.
Chief Tui: Thank you, Mother, that's enough.
Moana: Papa!
Chief Tui: No one goes outside the reef. We're safe here. There is no darkness. There are no monsters.
(Children screaming)
Chief Tui: There is nothing beyond that reef but storm and rough sea. As long as we stay on our very safe island, we'll be fine.
Gramma Tala: The legends are true. Someone will have to go.
Chief Tui: Mother, Motunui is paradise. Who would want to go anywhere else?
Chief Tui: Moana! Oh, there you are. Moana, what are you doing? You scared me.
Moana: Fun, I wants go back.
Chief Tui: I know, I know, but you don't go out there. It's dangerous. Moana, come on... Let's go back to the village. You are the next great chief of our people.
Sina: And you'll do wondrous things, my little minnow.
Chief Tui: Oh yes, but first, you must learn where you're meant to be.
Chief Tui: ♫ Moana, make way, make way / Moana, it's time you knew / The village of Motunui is all you need / The dancers are practicing / They dance to an ancient song / (Who needs a new song? This old one's all we need) / This tradition is our mission / And Moana, there's so much to do (Make way) / Don't trip on the taro root, that's all you need / We share everything we make (We make) / We joke and we weave our baskets (Aha!) / The fishermen come back from the sea ♫
Moana: ♫ I wanna see ♫
Chief Tui: ♫ Don't walk away / Moana, stay on the ground now / Our people will need a chief and there you are ♫
Chief Tui and Sina: ♫ There comes a day / When you're gonna look around / And realize happiness is where you are ♫
Chief Tui: ♫ Consider the coconut (the what?) / Consider its tree / We use each part of the coconut, that's all we need ♫
Sina: ♫ We make our nets from the fibers / The water's sweet inside / We use the leaves to build fires / We cook up the meat inside ♫
Chief Tui: ♫ Consider the coconuts / The trunks and the leaves / The island gives us what we need ♫
Moana: ♫ And no one leaves ♫
Chief Tui: ♫ That's right, we stay /We're safe and we're well provided / And when we look to the future / There you are / You'll be okay / In time you'll learn just as I did ♫
Chief Tui and Sina: ♫ You must find happiness right where you are ♫
Gramma Tala: ♫ I like to dance with the water / The undertow and the waves / The water is mischievous, ha! / I like how it misbehaves / The village may think I'm crazy / Or say that I drift too far / But once you know what you like, well, there you are /
You are your father's daughter / Stubbornness and pride / Mind what he says but remember / You may hear a voice inside / And if the voice starts to whisper / To follow the farthest star / Moana, that voice inside is who you are ♫
Moana: Dad! I was only looking at the boats. I wasn't gonna get on them.
Chief Tui: Come on. There's something I need to show you. I've wanted to bring you here from the moment you opened your eyes. This is a sacred place. The place of chiefs. There will come a time when you will stand on this peak and place a stone on this mountain. Like I did. Like my father did. And his father and every chief there has ever been. And on that day, when you place your stone, you will raise this whole island higher. You are the future of our people, Moana. They are not out there. They are right here. It's time to be who they need you to be.
Villagers: ♫ We make our nets from the fibers (We weave our nets from the fibers) / The water's sweet inside (And we'll taste the sweet inside) / We use the leaves to build fires (We sing these songs in our choir) / We cook up the meat inside (beat inside) ♫
Chief Tui: ♫ The village believes in us (Ha! That's right!) / The village believes (Ha!) / The island gives us what we need / And no one leaves ♫
Moana: ♫ So here I'll stay / My home, my people beside me / And when I think of tomorrow
Villagers: ♫ There we are ♫
Moana: ♫ I'll lead the way / I'll have my people to guide me / We'll build our future together ♫
Villagers: ♫ Where we are ♫
Moana: ♫ 'Cause every path leads you back to ♫
Villagers: ♫ Where you are ♫
Moana: ♫ You can find happiness right ♫
Villagers: ♫ Where you are / Where you are ♫
Villager: Every storm, this roof leaks no matter how many fronds I add.
Moana:Fixed! Not the fronds... Wind shifted the post. Mmm... That's good pork. Oh, I mean... No, I wasn't... What? They're calling me, so I gotta... Bye!
Moana: You're doing great.
Villager: Is he done yet?
Moana: So close.
Villager: I'm curious about that chicken eating the rock. He seems to lack the basic intelligence required for pretty much... everything. Should we maybe just... cook him?
Moana: Sometimes our strength lies beneath the surface. Far beneath... in... some cases. But I'm sure there's more to Heihei than meets the eye.
Villager: It's the harvest. This morning I was husking the coconuts and...
Moana: Well... We should clear the diseased trees. And we will start a new grove... there.
Villager: Thanks, Moana. She's doing great.
Chief Tui: This suits you.
Villager: Chief! There's something you need to see. Our traps in the east lagoon. They're pulling up less and less fish.
Moana: Then we'll rotate the fishing ground.
Villager: We have, there's no fish.
Moana: Oh... Then we'll fish far side of the island.
Villager: We tried.
Moana: The windward side?
Villager: And the leeward side. The shallows, the channel. We tried the whole lagoon. They're just... gone.
Villagers:
-What have you tried using for the bait?
-I don't use it as a bait.
Chief Tui: I will talk to the council. I'm sure we'll...
Moana: What if... we fished beyond the reef?
Chief Tui: No one goes beyond the reef.
Moana: I know. But if there are no fish in the lagoon...
Chief Tui: Moana...
Moana: And there's a whole ocean...
Chief Tui: We have one rule.
Moana: An old rule, when there were fish.
Chief Tui: A rule that keeps us safe!
Moana: But Dad!
Chief Tui: Instead of endangering our people so you can run right back to the water! Every time I think you're past this. No one goes beyond the reef!
Sina: Well, it's not like you said it in front of your dad... standing on a boat.
Moana: I didn't say ""go beyond the reef"" because I want to be on the ocean.
Sina: But you still do. He's hard on you, because...
Moana: Because he doesn't get me.
Sina: Because he was you. Drawn to the ocean. Down by the shore. He took a canoe, Moana. He crossed the reef and found an unforgiving sea. Waves like mountains. His best friend begged to be on that boat. He couldn't save him. He's hoping he can save you. Sometimes, who we wish we were, what we wish we can do is just not meant to be."

28430,"Raft throws you and your friends into an epic oceanic adventure! Alone or together, players battle to survive a perilous voyage across a vast sea! Gather debris, scavenge reefs and build your own floating home, but be wary of the man-eating sharks!

ABOUT THIS GAME
By yourself or with friends, your mission is to survive an epic oceanic adventure across
a perilous sea! Gather debris to survive, expand your raft and be wary of the dangers of
the ocean!

Trapped on a small raft with nothing but a hook made of old plastic, players awake on a vast,
blue ocean totally alone and with no land in sight! With a dry throat and an empty stomach,
survival will not be easy!

Raft throws you and your friends into an epic adventure out on the big open sea, with the
objective to stay alive, gather resources and build yourself a floating home worthy of
survival.

Resources are tough to come by at sea: Players will have to make sure to catch whatever debris floats by using their trusty hook and when possible, scavenge the reefs beneath the waves and the islands above.
However, thirst and hunger is not the only danger in the ocean… watch out for the man-
eating shark determined to end your voyage!


Features:
● Multiplayer! Survive by yourself or with friends in online co-op!
● Hook! Use your hook to catch debris floating by.
● Craft! Build survival equipment, weapons, crop plots and more to help you stay alive!
● Build! Expand your raft from a simple wreckage to a buoyant mansion.
● Research! Learn new things to craft in the research table.
● Navigate! Sail your raft towards new places!
● Dive! Drop anchor and explore the depths for more resources.
● Fight! Defend your raft from the dangers of the ocean.

28431,This game is fun and takes your eyes away from time.
28432,Buggy
28433,Surprisingly intense and addictive.
28434,"So now with the new Update its time for an update.
This game is fun, now that I played the questmissions. 
I like the graphics, and the little details in the animations. It's a fun game and worth the money and time.

Cons:
you can't pick up stones of the shore you have to be in the water to get the stone and its only possible with the one tool to get the stone.

the other thing that is super annoying. you only can hit animals with the weapon like wooden spear but not with the axe. I mean c'mon.

28488,ahah shark eat my bunghole
28489,"*THE GAME HAD POTENTIAL*
After being begged by my friends to get Raft because ""It would be so much fun"" I bought it. Hopped on the game and just was kinda disappointed by the lack of content that this game has. THE ENTIRE GAME is based upon being stuck in the MIDDLE OF THE OCEAN..............Idk why the devs just didn't let the creativity flow and add tons of marine life and cool stuff underwater. (By cool stuff underwater I don't mean the occasional sunken ship with just a crate in it.) They should have at least some different types of fish in the game or something every time you go underwater all you see is the same shark that never stops following your raft. The game gets old fast and you will soon find yourself bored floating with the current probably looking at your other monitor. EVEN WHEN I went to the story islands it was incredibly boring and underwhelming I didn't even want to explore. The story kinda sucks its written out on papers and notes for players to find on the unique islands. Like who wants to read an entire story? I bought a game not a book. Either way I feel like it could have been better and the game has been out for 3 years and I experienced the same gameplay I watched on youtube 3 years ago, So I'm not sure updates are gonna save this one."
28490,Update THE FUCKING GAME
28491,.
28492,Sadly this game is not like other survival games. Nothing is intuitive and there is no tutorial making it near impossible to figure out without looking it up. I really did not find it enjoyable and after about an hour it started making me feel sick which has never happened before. Disappointed more than anything else I was really looking forward to it.

28501,shark is crazy
28502,"Amazing game, fun with friends or alone."
28503,"It is very open-ended, with a loose storyline and things you can follow. There are many things to explore, and a lot of creative freedom when it comes to customizing your home. There is a lot of grinding involved, so you can hope to squeeze many hours in to the game. Bonus points if your playing with friends!"
28504,i mean its all right
28505,"As someone who has only played this game for five hours, I would say it is fun."
28506,it is gud game
28507,Love it can't wait for chapter 3
28508,"most fun ive had with my friends 10/10 would recommend

Tip: dont use most recorses at start just get what you absolutely need then when youve got maybe 2 stacks of wood and plastic then you can make stuff, and get a fishing rod :)"

28521,"Raft
Love the game and how it plays when it comes to being hunted down by a bloodthirsty shark! The adventure is amazing and progression of new and better tools and resources are done very well although wood is a bit too needy when it comes to fueling certain appliances."
28522,"this game teaches you how to survive on a raft that is all alone in the middle of the never ending depths of the ocean sea floor, it teaches you how to summon objects out of thin air and just point and it will be there somehow."
28523,float on da boat
28524,AMAZING
28525,well this game is amazing and you can explore it alot i really recommend you play raft you can make your own floating base like a house its full of aciton and peacefull mode you can really experience nature

but slowly getting there

maybe some day we are good enough to go to easy and keep the Shark off"
28555,great game to play with friends.
28556,I have no clue how to play it right but it is fun
28557,it is very good but be aware that you will need to drink and eat very often
28558,cool
28559,good game but no funny among us
28560,"An immensely fun and exploitative game. I have a fear of open water, but honestly, playing this game is so relaxing (so long as I play with someone else to do all the swimming parts xD)"

28568,good fun game
28569,"Very fun and cool, cant wait to see future updates. Would recommend if you enjoy The Forest, Minecraft, Skyblock, Terraria, and other survival games."
28570,"epic game, i cannot wait for new updates.

great way to spend time with the love of your life or your worst enemy"
28571,this game is amazing its a hard but such a experience  though.  its a great game i would highly recommed  this game for people who like survival games over all i love the game  the creators did a excellent  job with the game!
28572,"Stupidly fun. But if your friends drive you insane, you can always play by yourself. Save your sanity"
28573,simple game yet so entertaining especially with friends!
28574,"fun and grinding, i would say play with friends"
28575,"i love raft and playomg with afirneds so fun so fun
"
28576,I can confirm
28577,"Ive never seen a game that punishes you more for playing it than this one, eternal sharks that always show up to prevent you from getting resources underwater that are crucial to progression, constantly taking chunks out of your raft, killing the shark only stops it for about 5 minutes, there are better survival games for less money"
28578,"Really fun game especially with friends

28586,"It's fun by yourself, and amazing with friends."
28587,"Excellent resource management game concept. Mechanics are simple to learn and utilize. You can't go wrong with a shark for a villain, honestly. Between Bruce, the warthog and a bird who drops rocks on your head if you get too close--there is just enough jump scare potential to keep things interesting. I'm enjoying this immensely as a wind down game at the end of the day."
28588,plank on water is fun
28589,"A lot of fun with friends. I have lots of funny moments of friends jumping into the water to get supplies, only to die from the shark. Very butt clenching. 9.5/10."
28590,You can fish.
28591,f u n
28592,"+ Some of the best coop ever
+ My wife and I love this game, partly because it supports different but complementary playstyles: she loves building the raft and I love scrounging materials
+ Sailing is awesome and great for story and game mechanics. Why are there so few sailing games?
+ Having a mobile base is awesome
+ Fun to see the studio keep adding more content. It motivates us to start over yet again."
28593,"I like this game a lot, i can't even think of anything that i dislike about this game. definitely recommended (it's even better if you have people to play with)"
28594,Good

28602,"spent 38 hours with a liar person in this game. Don't play with liars, cowards and betrayers. Better would f***** away, than had gift me this"
28603,"Really fun. While the game does take a while to start to get interesting, it is a fun experience nonetheless. It is great to play with friends and also a great single player. If you are planning on getting this game I would wait for a sale because while it is a good game, it shouldn't be priced at $20."

28619,very slave like
28620,"Raft is by far one of my favourite games for late night and chill sessions, havoc may occur with friends on board, the shark may eat your friend, or you may ditch them all together. This game allows for a diverse experience to all players with a wonderful pacing and a variety of options for pacifist or try hard payers. You may not be able to go in there guns blazing, but a spear does just as well with practice."
28621,perfect game about surviving on raft and adventures recommend it. bad to creative mode you cant move your raft

28632,"new update pls,i waiting new update like a year"
28633,fun gaem
28634,"Horrible game if you like survival game. You are often times confined to your raft at long periods of time - the premise of the game of course - but are always lacking materials to build and inventory management is a chore. No room in chests and you cannot craft from them, so get ready to rearrange often.
The game saves when you die - awesome - you loose everything on you. I needed one leaf to make a rope for building a chest (which is one of the many many many spring cleanings you will have to do) and had a lot of loot on me after visiting an island. Went into the water to get the leaf and the shark bit me tree times in five seconds and I died. Respawn on raft loosing everything I had on me. No reason to reload, since the game, as mentioned, saves on death.
I wanted to like it, but I really dont. It's lackluster and way to rigid. The inventory management made me angry most of the time and the death where I lost everything was the final straw. Done with this."
28635,"it is a good sandbox style survival game... start with a 2x2 raft and go from there

28647,"Such a chill game, I love all the exploring and occasional murdering :)"

good things: creative, survival, crafting, and multiplayer.


bad things: no voice chat, survival can be annoying, and not much to do.


hope this helps"
28690,epoc gamees sot epoc can use raft epoc spooky shark
28691,only 3 chapters. no real goal. no real incentive to do anything. no resolution or objectives. its a fun game but very limited and very incomplete. to play after ch3 there is an update? that there is no prompt for? or incentive to buy? not worth buying now. once the game is developed then yea. the game is as basic as it gets :\ feels like too much time passes by for updates to come out and not really improve or add anything of value or anything new to make the game a little more interesting. it needs a lot of work.
28692,im confused and lost but cool game you can roleplay

28698,Wushi Really Likes this Game!
28699,Very cool game to play with friends or alone. There are different ways to play and decorate your raft.You can explore different islands while playing the Story or just gathering resources. There are still some bugs but they are not frequently so the game is still very enjoyable!
28700,"I have really enjoyed my time in this game, it's both fun and relaxing with a nice and slow progression system. I have completed the main storyline, build a giant sharkproff raft and will properly come back to it again, when there are new updates. Overall, very enjoyable."

I almost wish that the shark bait would work to attract the sharks on this mode though (for food), but it's not a big deal. I love the recent update with the additional sea animals, the giant whale (blue whale?) caught me off guard lol! I hope there could be an expansion or more updates for this game in the future. I highly recommend this to anyone who enjoys a good survival game with comprehensive survival mechanics with a story and eventual ending. This game is also great to play with friends!"

28734,"amazing game :), played with my friend and when encountering the ‘poison puffers’ together, I got a notice about it.

Me : ""DO NOT EAT THE SEA POTATOES.""
My friend: ""DEATH TO THE SEA POTATOES."" 

They did end up killing it, which is how we got our first accessory. They were really proud of it for some reason- I assume because they couldn’t actually see themselves.. because they looked like a lunch lady. [No offense to lunch ladies, they are angels.]"

I've only played this game in co-op and it is perfect that way, so much to explore and so much you can do with expanding your raft to make it bigger and better the only problem is once you complete the current story missions and build your raft how you like it and have all your resources there is nothing to do besides wait for the next update but other then the waiting for the next update this has been one of the best games there is"
28824,"A very fun game! there is so much to do and build, You figure your closing in then you unlock a bunch more lol it's just a real fun game Great job! Highly recommend and if it every comes out on console ill be there to support y'all too lol"
28825,"Hours of fun. Playing with friends is much better than alone, in my eyes, but a brilliant game all round."
28826,its fun
28827,"It's another one of those ""keep bars from going to zero with crafting"" kind of survival games you've seen done by the dozen.
With this game, the theme's you, a raft and an endless sea with a lot of scavenging and island trips to make your dinky pile of planks into a vessel that can actually travel without a Shark tearing chunks out of it every couple of minutes.

Like most games of this genre, it's best played with friends because by yourself, it's a slow trudge trying to build up resources and dying is a massive setback since you don't drop any of the items you are carrying. They all evaporate from your body the moment that happens.
So if you have a group of friends looking for a game that can pass the time for a bit while playing sea shanties, this is a good pick. But I genuinely don't recommend this as a solo experience, unless you use Creative mode and just build things."
28828,good
28829,Use the endless stream of pollution to build yourself a new home in a world where climate change has submerged almost all the land in water.  This might as well be a future sailing simulator!
28830,I enjoyed the story behind i think its really fun to play with friends and overall just thrilling
28831,I like Raft
28832,this is a very cool game i playd it for 24h+  and i would give it 10 out fo 10
28833,"good moist fun
"
28834,"I've been playing a lot of Raft since it came out, I love the aesthetic, the story is intriguing, and there are tricks to building your Raft to give it some interesting looks.

My main save struggles to run higher than 12 FPS despite graphic settings so hopefully they manage to find a way to optimize the game and I can enjoy that fully again, since the renovation update it looks a lot better.

Depending on what type of player you are this game can either have a lot of content or not as much, but it is Early Access, and it is one of those Early Access gems that plays really well, looks really good, and is a really nice experience. I love to drift in this game on my completed save and just evolve my Raft further and further.

Bring your friends for a couple of hours here and there for a nice experience of survival, exploration, and sometimes a bit of chaos if you want.

The devs keep in touch with the community and also allow direct suggestions to them via a form, they're a smaller studio though so I can imagine it takes a lot of time to get to them all :) But then there is also the mod community that has been innovative and bring out decent content as well.

Scoring this game in it's current state, based on player experience, general atmosphere, amount of content, and where it seems to be going:
7/10, I really love this game, but as mentioned, it doesn't necessarily have a lot of content in it, but it is still being updated a couple of times a year and is in active development, so with all that in mind, with more content I would give this game (as a guide to other consumers) a score of 8.5/10."
28835,Got this game for me and my friends and ITS SOOOO GOOOD

28845,no because i dont like the game personally games like that arent personally my choice of play it sounded fun but it wasnt if you played with your friends it got a little better but still kinda boring
28846,"This game has left me and my friend very exited
"
28847,"Given the chance, this game is a lot of fun. I gave up on it a few times before I finally decided to stick through it and gave it a solid shot. I'm mad at myself for not doing it sooner tbh. I don't know if it was the Chapter 2 update that did it for me but I quickly found myself in love with Raft. I spent about 40 hours exploring it and beating the current content and I'm pretty sad it ended where it did. I find myself going back to the store page at least once a month to see if theyve added another update so I can get my Raft fix again."

28859,"I can't get past the whole ""floats past and explores large islands that could easily sustain them/NOPE IM ONNA BOAT LOL"".
And frankly, I think a neverending army of sharks would have better things to do. Attack Atlantis or something."
28860,Very cool game. It's very fun game to play with friends. It's chill game where you don't have to stress at most of the time. It can get stressful in normal/hard mode with creatures (that kills) player have discovered. Easily best multiplayer game. Single player is also fun but it gets bored pretty quick.

I want more to be added to the story because I think the devs have a great way to continue the game. I would recommend this game, but if you hate cliffhangers then I wouldn't play."

28901,I had an old account with over 200 hours on this game and I loved it. I signed out once because I got a PC instead of an old laptop that could run it poorly at 40 fps with low graphics. I got it again but had to pay again. I don't want a refund. But what I am saying is I enjoyed it so much by my self for over 200 hours. I recommend 10/10 with future updates to come this could be a even better game

28953,"Started a new world five times, each time I managed to get into a stalemate where I don't have any resources to continue nor any way to get more resources. Then I gave up. Hope in its final state the game won't feel this hopeless."
28954,"Everything in this game feels like a bit of a chore and i do not know where the fun comes in. Exploration comes close but there is never really a pay off, building feels boring and collecting resources to do so just feels tedious.

Also playing it with the shark turned on only made the game more frustrating and infuriating. Buy Stranded Deep, it does everything in this game much better."
28955,Amazing game for friends or if you're just looking to kick back and listen to music. A+ Gang approved.

Hats off."

28999,"Great game with wonderful open world. You really spend hours & hours and feel like you want more. Relaxing adventure, that changes to the escapes and hiding from the animal enemies.
Design itself is amazing: the comfortable craft menu, enjoyful views, fun&attractive animal design (even the rats, I hate them, but they are cool as enemies models).

Minus: I am not happy with how the jumps work, I wish it would be easier for some exact parts where you can't get somewhere the other way."
29000,nice game
29001,super fun game alone or playing with a friend
29002,It's a really fun game to waste time in and is being expanded upon regularly. I highly recommend this game.

29020,great
29021,it if fun to play with friends and single player it is worth the subscription i would recoment
29022,Do not buy this game as a early release.. concept and gameplay is fine but story is unbelievably short and devs prioritize dumb asthetic updates over the actual gameplay.. its been well over a year since chapter 2 and they cant even give us a relative eta for chapter 3..  the story is so short its easily completed in a day .. not worth the money as the game sits even heavily on sale.
29023,WOW
29024,This game has been a very fun experience so far. One that keeps me going for hours. It has plenty of room for improvement with bug fixes and possible added content. Overall a great game that is really fun when playing with friends and can be fun and relaxing playing solo.
29025,"I am new to this type of game, and as a beginner its pretty easy to pick up.  I enjoy playing with my friends and I like that it has a creative mode for when I wanna just create by myself."

29031,very good game to play with friends and i find it really fun to build in creative with my friends
29032,i need the game to update with a third person perspective. Because the first person perspective is too dizzy for the player..pleseee.. thank!!!!
29033,"reallly fun late  game
"
29034,"I love adventure/survival games but this one is up there with Ark Survival, in fact, I think it tops my list.  I love the adventure aspect.  The building aspect enables you to be very creative.  The interface is very user friendly and I find the recipes to crafting aren't too cumbersome.  The crafting menu is very clear and easy to use.  The different aspects of the game once you get more established are fun from cooking to designing different areas on your raft to suit the various functions of the game, for instance, a kitchen, a smelting area, a bee hut, storage unit, bio fuel station, living quarters.  I just love every aspect of the game and as a mature player, I find it's quite manageable even  with my very bad parkour skills, I still managed to jump and maneuvre my way around the main story islands.  The killing of animals was also manageable once you find your grove and see that there are limits each predator have which make killing more manageable for the player without dying instantly.  Each of the story islands have there pros and cons, but my favourite so far was Caravan Island, what a great adventure from start to finish from deep see diving to the relentless flying predator (which I killed as a trophy).   I love this game and have been recommending it to friends and family.  I wish the story didn't ever have to end!  I would definitely recommend this game if you like Ark Survival or any survival adventure games.  This is more adventure and creativity over surviving compared to Ark as there  is far less defence which enables you to just chill out and get taken away from reality during your game play. 
 Great game and worth every minute spent playing!"
29035,"this game is excellent to play with friends, its just enjoyable"
29036,"hello
"
29037,Love it! The only negative is waiting so long for the next update.
29038,"This is a fun game. You research to find new recipes to build. You explore and find islands some for resources some for story and recipes for building. There is a shark, they call him Bruce, you may want to watch out for him a little bait may go a long way.

All and all a pretty great game I'd definitely recommend playing it."

29100,SOO COOL SHARK BE LIKE BRRRR BY BY RAFT HAHAHHAHAHA
29101,Really good
29102,Great game!
29103,This is the Way! 7 / 10.
29104,its fun
29105,"Just buy the game, you will not regret it, 

Full review:
https://youtu.be/x_jVbGWGvPY"
29106,"Fantastic ""Survival Game,"" with a lot of charm and character.  Do wish they push out the new expansion soon... Been in the dark for a while :("
29107,yes
29108,haha raft go brr
29109,Very fun for early access. Does a good job building on itself and making progression feel good.
29110,Fun game with friends. Bruce is a dick.
29111,"This game is a lot of fun if you like grinding and just a great dynamic game overall 10/10 recommend
"
29112,pem
29113,"is a fun game
"
29114,Although the start is a little shaky with everything going on; this game is still amazing. Haven't tried solo personally but the 2-4 players made for some very good laughs and fun. The story is pretty captivating and I'm looking forward to seeing Chapter 3 when it comes out.
29115,Awesome!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
29116,"Great game, excellent potential, just don't finish the story quickly still. you'll be out of things to do."
29117,This game is fun & peaceful(most times) games.
29118,v
29119,This game is so fun. 10/10 would recommend
29120,Be prepared to be extremely bored for 40 mins
29121,"Controls do NOT function properly.  NO tutorial.  COMPLETE WASTE OF TIME AND MONEY!!!!!
I WANT MY MONEY BACK!!!!!!!!!!"
29122,GOOD GAME
29123,"lose all inventory on death! Buggy game kills you at random, all of my time in this game was a complete waste. The story is pointless because after 8 hours I had no inventory and no way to get more. This product is a piece of garbage not just because of the bugs, The design decision to destroy your inventory is flat stupid and I wish I had my money back."
29124,POOP
29125,"This game is extremely boring. Very grindy food and water game loop, buggy gameplay resulting in occasional crashes. Poor UI makes doing basic things extremely frustrating - if you have something on your quickbar and use all of it up, it disappears and you will have to remake the quickbar entry again.

I regret buying this and wish I hadn't gone AFK for too long so that I couldn't get a refund."
29126,Awesome adventure free-world game!
29127,This is the buggiest game I have ever played. Devs have a LOT of work to do to make this game enjoyable. I regret my purchase.
29128,frrtgyseubhdngivjj
29129,Very nice and calming game. Certainly fun to play on your own on a calming day/night. Co-op is a thing and playing with your friends is either extremely fun or it can be the absolute worst experience of your life
29130,its good BUT FUCKING UPDATE WHEN???????
29131,its a very fun game to play with friends or family!
29132,It is a very good and fun i would recommend to anyone. The story is not 100% complete i am waiting on chapter 3 for the story
29133,"This is a thumbs-sideways for me as opposed to a thumbs-up.  The game is enjoyable and relaxing for what it is.  However, it needs more content to be a firm thumbs-up for me.  If the updates were more regular, I'd say ""hey, ignore the EA tag and jump right in!"", but honestly the extremely long time between patches is one step up from Abandonware.  

I don't regret buying the game, but I also wish I'd waited until it had left Early Access before plunking $20 down for it."
29134,انها
29135,Good gam
29136,"At first the game is a bit hard alone, and i do believe playing with friends would be more enjoyable, but after about an hour you get the hang of it and its pretty fun. I couldnt manage to have a raft bigger than 5 by 6 due to the shark ,but again playing with a friend would make it much easier."
29137,Good game
29138,asZ
29139,"Raft is great, it just lacks content. After you play for about 8 hours , you have fully upgraded your raft and seen everything and its just empty after that, no goal or even reason to keep playing. But the full 8+ hrs you play are full of insane fun especially with friends.

It is a bit sad that the only real enemy / thing in the sea is the shark, there whales and  turtle and dolphins but they dont do anything. Some new enemies in the water would make it feel better."
29140,"It is not a bad game. But other games do it better. 
Valheim is better at discovery. No Man's Sky is better at survival. And Satisfactory has better base building. 
I want to experience the adventure portrayed in the trailers, but this is a grind-to-play game, and I don't have the patience to sludge through boring grinding-mechanics to ""unlock"" the cool content."
29141,I was stuck on a raft with the bois and we named the shark Cian because he is the most annoying person ever and it really suited the shark. We first killed Cian 4 times and then I killed him in Real Life.
29142,its sooo fun like i am playing with my friend and you start with a tiny raft and u can make it big
29143,very good :) would recomend
29144,GG
29145,"This is a very amazing open-world survival game with such a simple concept that has been executed perfectly and with such a fantastic story. 
There is so much fun to be had with your friends or on your own i would highly recommend this game as it will leave you busy for hours.
With the newest update: Renovation update you can customize your raft with objects that could make it feel homely and custom to your own design.
And if you don't feel like playing the story or trying survival? Then just go into creative and build to your hearts content.
This game is hours of fun and it is worth the money paid for it.
"
29146,vali d raft go brrrrrrr
29147,"fakin rekin
"
29148,"There is a raft, you hook things, expand raft. Eat and drink more than any natural human being could. Enjoy fine dining by eating your watery nemesis. Don't think that's fun? Just bring a friend."
29149,walh it good game and i like it
29150,i liek
29151,"Fun crafting survival game with friends. Not much fun alone, another concern is that the game is not updated often. You will often find yourself and your friends reaching the end of the game as it is, and then joining the rest of us waiting for the next update. Still lots of fun, if you can get it on a sale and you got three other buddies to play with, go for it."
29152,"You'd find yourself confused when you play this game for the first time, but this game is really easy to understand the more you play it. You'd have to google things here and there thought to make it easier.

Really fun to play with friends, the game gets easier the more you play but it's still pretty challenging most of the time. 4/5"
29153,"i need friends
am all alone"
29154,Very fun.
29155,Great!
29156,fun game bruh

29161,e
29162,good
29163,"Fun game, although it takes them forever to release new content."
29164,good game i made a friend stop playing and refund the game because he could not figure out how to drink water and would not tell him 10/10 game would high recommend with friends
29165,Love the game

29167,yup

29177,Raft is essentially a survival simulation. You retrieve items to expand your boat and grow food to survive.

29188,"""That's the best pirate I've ever seen...""
It's a really decent game - fun mechanics, cheap, suitable for semi-potato PCs, easy to spend many hours on this game
GREAT value for money!"
29189,"Smooth gameplay, excellent coop, great UI, engaging enough story, and generally great game mechanics. In current early access stage, there are definitely more desired content such as more marine life, etc, but I give this a 5/5 even in its stage. Keep up the good work."
29190,good

29199,"Raft is one of my top picks for survival games. It's interesting new way of giving the player a limited play area to me is reminiscent of Minecraft skyblock. This game is a great way to blow an afternoon with your sister, and I'm sure I'll be playing it for years to come"

It's a really fun game, it's not completed when I'm writing this but if anyone likes world exploration, survival and a lil' bit of plot on the side I can recommend. I would only say that for some reason it has some issues with lagging on lowet settings but honestly who knows, might just be m."
29208,"Yes, very good game for anyone who enjoys minecraft. The recent update they made is amazing and for the price it is a very good game, I recommend trying it."

"
29219,Surprisingly captivating.
29220,its fun
29221,good game 👍
29222,"You start on a raft with little control over mobility then you slowly build up from sail then to engine as you follow the story. A very smooth transition that you can play on your own pace. This game also allows you to set difficulties and options to prevent you from getting overwhelmed. Overall, the idea is golden, the execution is near perfect, let's hope the small dev team can keep up with the updates."
29223,BARREL!
29224,"A simple survival game in the vein of Minecraft and Rust. Good atmosphere, art, and music. My friend and I haven't even touched the story because of how engrossing customizing and expanding your raft is. Great for killing time and hanging with friends. There are a few glitches that we've come across, but at worst they're annoying, never game-breaking. A sure recommendation for fans of survival games."
29225,"Both my son and I play this game. 
really Enjoyable especially creative mode

20th min: Realizes this was the best 20 min of my life"
29264,"awesome and eazy to play
"
29265,"   This game is interesting. There is a fun storyline and you never feel like there is an end even if you've got the perfect boat. Grinding is fun in this game to. There is a few bugs thought. One of wich is you can only once enter the top of Tangoroa (a story island).
   The game is cool the updates are slow, but very good!"
29266,"I love this game!
The build is so fun, and the storyline keeps giving you more and more.
Can't wait till the next episode."
29267,relaxing
29268,boat
29269,Decided to buy a copy for myself and a friend. Definitively an amazing/ hilarious journey. Only three hours in and it's been great.
29270,love this game
29271,This game has a lot of potential but its not ready to recommend to anyone unless you just like to farm endlessly to build your dream raft lol. The combat is an absolute joke. way to predictable and easy. The shark should be much larger and harder to kill. must of killed it well over 50times without ever dying. after putting in around 4k hours in RUST i can not bring myself to farm another damn tree or node or build any larger of a raft than what i need to obtain the gear and exact ammo i need to kill the what i need to. The game needs more content but the devs are horribly slow. i put in almost 50hrs and gave it a damn good try but after its all said and done im kind of sad i wasted so much time with this game. so many bugs. fell through the map on several occasions. luckily you just fall into the ocean and swim out of the island lol
29272,very good
29273,This game is pretty dang fun!
29274,This game is so much fun with friends
29275,its good there is lamas
29276,its very addictive
29277,hot garbage you should buy it
29278,"its a ""play when i get bored but stop playing when i get more bored"" type of game. all in all. good cookie"
29279,Hey you I be have for 60 H.
29280,amazing game probably the best game i have purchased!
29281,"Fun to play with friends, good story line. Wish they would add onto the story"
29282,this game is so fun to progress in with and without friends
29283,"Pretty good for an early access. Prepare to lose in simple ways a lot in the beginning while you're learning. Once you familiarize yourself, it's a lot more fun beyond the initial fun. Definitely better with a friend though.

The hook does bug at the moment sometimes. I assume because the waves go over the wood of the raft and the game thinks you're swimming momentarily. If that'd get fixed, then it'd be a lot better."
29284,"I love that you have control over how you would like to play the game.  I personally found the shark to be very annoying, but there's an option for players like me that just want a more chill experience.  You don't even have to do the missions if you don't feel like it.  I recommend looking up Markiplier's Youtube videos on this game, it's what sold it to me."
29285,shark
29286,Good game
29287,hehe
29288,good soup
29289,Very chill game. You can go at your own pace and create something you're proud of. I highly recommend playing this game in multiplayer.
29290,funaft
29291,Fun.
29292,"i can not close the game to play it
"
29293,It's not so easy game to finish. Gamer will need lot of patience and some part of luck. But the game will give you lot of fun :)
29294,fun
29295,Everything breaks too fast. There really is no free will in sailing. You only go in the direction the game wants you to so you cant return anywhere you were. You cant remove structure you have build without making an axe. If a wave hit your boat while building and it goes diagonal you are stuck with it till you farm another axe. I found this game extremely annoying and not fun at all like other survival games.
29296,"Grabbing debris with your hook is addicting as playing the dang claw games at the arcade. There's this little tingle of satisfaction that comes with collecting your prize. Being on a raft offers a nice twist for people who like to build and design. Your ever present and hungry escort, Bruce the shark, makes sure you're never really alone...or unharassed. The story line is far from finished however the existing story is quite enjoyable.  If open world survival craft is your thing, give this game a try."
29297,play game pls
29298,check my profile
29299,very nice game i like it
29300,"SO much fun!  In a team or solo, this is a solid return of fun for your money!

I originally wasn't that interested in it conceptually and only gave it a shot because my friends were.  I'm so glad I did.  I ended up powering through the story line solo because I wasn't patient enough for everyone else to log on!"
29301,it good. new updates would be nice tho
29302,Really really fun and interesting game but a big negative point is that you can only have 1 party leader who has to be on the server for the others to play.
29303,To summarize this game there are 3 things you will say: Shark! I need wood! I need plastic!
29304,"Its fun, you should buy."
29305,yes
29306,this is what happens when you don't care about global warming
29307,"Boleh tahan game ni, belajar hidup kat pulau hjahahaha tapi seronokkkk"
29308,BEST GAME
29309,Very fun and a good time waster. Ready and waiting for the next update
29310,Amazing very peaceful definetly would recommend
29311,"Nice game enjoy everything 
must be waiting chapter 3"
29312,Very relaxing game. Perfect for loot-hounds who enjoy hoarding items like rabid squirrels. Only negative thing so far is that my thalassophobia goes WEEWOO
29313,"NERD ASS SHARK

ONE THING THAT WAS A BIT STRANGE WAS I LOGGED OF AND WHEN I LOGGED BACK ON ALL OF MY STUFF WENT MISSING."
29328,"Very chill, very easy to just drift and survive and zone out for a few hours. A little repetitive but not in a bad way."
29329,yes
29330,This game is very fun if you like games with good LORE. It´s a game on it´s best in normal mode so that it is not really a game to try really hard for but it is in some way a challenge! I would recommend having a friend/family member play with you since it's a good way to have some laughs. 100% worth the money and the gameplay is one of the best!
29331,This game is much Fun!

the crafting in this game is just so realistic.

29362,wd
29363,alright
29364,pretty good
29365,"Raft feels like it is just barely held together by some crusty duct tape and glue sticks, begging and pleading for a higher power to put it out of its misery, and the experience is overflowing with bugs and general janky-ness/frustration. Many crucial mechanics are never explained or detailed, inventory management is a nightmare, simple tasks require more effort/time than they should, and you'll often be saying to yourself ""Why the hell does(n't) it work that way??"" Combat is a joke and the only things that pose a real threat are hunger and the  s h a r k.

With that said, it is my incredible (dis)pleasure to admit that Raft is one of the most enjoyable games in its entire genre. The concept is novel and the ability to relocate your entire base (the raft) creates interesting gameplay interactions I wasn't expecting. Story is nearly nonexistent but the quest environments themselves are very interesting and the recipes you obtain from them culminate in a stable feeling of progression. Building mechanics are solid and allow for the creation of some surprisingly cozy homes on the ocean.

Wary of early access but it seems like the game is fairly frequently updated by the devs and the content present already is worth it during a sale. Game is also much, much better with friends."
29366,great fun with friends but only down side i am afraid of oceans so the game makes me nervous but its still fun
29367,Fun asf lil short tho nice game to play wit ur friends
29368,it gud
29369,Its so  fun and you can make funny things with your friends if you have some lol
29370,Boring
29371,It's a good  game  I recommend.
29372,"The game itself is interesting however there few things that still need to be worked on. Example when you are anchored  on an island. The shark should not follow you to the island if water shallow  or  at least not attack u in very shallow water .  I was on a beach trying to pick some rocks on the beach. But i have to use a hook to pick a rock and have to soak in some waves that hits the shore in order to use a hook on a tiny pebble rock.Yet the stupid shark bit me in the shallow water where it could beach itself on the beach.Weird shark. Anyway, cant use the hook on the beach area where u cant soak yourself to get the rocks.  This  does not make sense.. You are on a beach you should be able to pick a tiny piece of pebble rock on the beach with bare hands not a hook. I know   Game still work in progress and has  lot of things need to be worked , tweaked and improved. I'm hoping they will add a function where you can pick beach rocks with bare hands, If Rock a little big, a choice should be added to break a rock with  stone axe or something. Or pick a big rocks to use  for anchoring . 

When you die you lose your stuff except ur raft. So you might wnat storage containers made   to keep important parts like seeds, blueprints, and precious material u might fine like metal ore or glass etc.

Would i recommend the game? I'm not sure. Maybe get it on discount to try and experiment and hope for improvement."

29385,so cool
29386,The primary gameplay loop of throwing out a hook and dragging stuff back to you gives me the same zen feeling I imagine those who enjoy fishing get throwing a line out on a lake. Great fun solo and even better with friends.
29387,This game saved me through the lockdown. After watching Markiplier play through this i knew it would be something i loved. I love the menial tasks of farming and creating elaborate storage systems and this game allowed me to have control over that. I used to live by the ocean and have always found it calming so to have a game where i could endlessly explore the oceans and farm coral reefs was magical. Eagerly awaiting the next chapter however i have MORE than enough to do on my raft and overhaul it ready to fill it with more animal and more wonders from the deep

29395,"No updates or dev blogs since June, game is dead."
29396,"I keep coming back to this game and enjoying it every time. It's relaxing, fun, and I am really looking forward to where the story and content goes next.

Adding to this review after another 100 hours played!

I still love and will keep coming back to Raft. ""The Final Chapter"" update has added so much more content, it has doubled the length of the game or more. There's even more to see, create, explore, and the story is really satisfying to discover.

Literally the only part that left me really frustrated is right near the end there's a series of platform jumps with rotating fan-like sails that you have to jump/duck/avoid and it took a long time to get past. It's tricky, hard to time it right, and if you fall off on the second half of the area there's no other ""checkpoint platform"" meaning you have to do the longest and hardest part of the area all in one go. And you have to do it all at least twice, once to retrieve an item to unlock a new area, and the second time to go back with a different item you got from the other area to progress to the last part. It wouldn't be so bad if there was a way to drop a ladder or stop the rotating parts after reaching the end point. But that's literally the only single little segment of the entire game that I found frustrating.

Massive congratulations and a huge thanks to everyone who worked on this game for making it so enjoyable an experience, and I really look forward to what you do next - whether it is more content for Raft, a sequel, or an entirely new project."
29397,more fun with friends
29398,Very enjoyable with others

29408,It was honestly a very fun experience and playing with my friends was even better
29409,"A chill, relaxing survival crafting game where most of your time is spent drifting around the sea on a raft collecting debris and sometimes finding islands containing bigger concentrations of resources. Has a currently incomplete story that's tied to progression, and updates have been slow.

Main negatives are that it's fairly grindy for progression due to needing so many materials to build out and improve the raft, combat being shallow, and the survival part in the late game feeling like just an inconvenience."
29410,One of the best multiplayer survival game that I've played. Bruce is the best character. I would die for him (and I have multiple times actually...)

29433,you can cook the bird that eats your crops 10/10 . and it tastes just like chicken .
29434,pretty fun
29435,"I am so hyped for this game's full release, I swear to god.

Now I've done a few playthroughs of the game (up to Balboa twice, then Tangaroa twice from a fresh raft) and oh boy is the game fun. It's relaxing, it's upbeat, the lore's interesting and subtle, the challenge is there? Yeah. In terms of survival games, not only is Raft drifting something new into the open-world survival genre, but it's doing it with a storm behind it.

I understand that the game isn't complex (build a fancy boat etc), but personally, there are two big things I'd love in the game:
1: co-op multiple Rafts. Once you build a raft, rather than breaking a whole chunk/having it magically drift along at the exact same rate as the main boat, allow for multiple on the same world. I don't know how complex it'd be to do, but I'd love a Sea of Thieves esc game setting. Either us PVE lovers would have a blast, accidentally finding one another and drifting along as a pack for awhile, or the PVP nutters would be up to their necks in stuff to do.

2: More lore, honestly. The basics are there, but I'd love some more. The game is giving me a slight Fallout-esc hint to it (probably the 70's vibe to the marketing on Tangaroa), and I'd love something like that to be honest. Perhaps NPC's to add to it, giving the game a bit more to explore in the future.

Overall though; not hard to run (A little taxing on max graphics as most games are), but fun is there to be had."
29436,This game is awesome! by far one of my favorite games to chill and pass time with. It can get difficult but its fun single player and even more fun with friends. :)
29437,"Raft ironically stems from an ocean of survival games here on steam. A lot are cheaply made and cash grabs but some are made with love, purpose and intent. Some subjective examples of good survival games are Ark, Subnautica, Valheim, The Forest, Green Hell and of course, Raft.

You start Raft on makeshift raft (shocker.) No goal or direction, only the looming threat of a shark who would like to snack on your body and your instinctive reaction to not let that happen. From there you begin fishing for supplies that are floating by like wood and plastic with the idea that you can use this stuff to craft survival essentials like water purifiers until you have built a big enough raft for you to survive comfortably at sea. 

There is a story in this game. It is an early access game and therefore still under construction, but from the available chapters I've played, I can say it's onto some interesting world building. The story is told on key islands scattered throughout the game and explained through notes you find. Notes explaining how the world ""ended"" and things that are presently happening. The islands also add a nice intermission from being at sea constantly and incorporate some puzzle solving elements that aren't always a quick fix.
I have played through the available story and as of right now, drifting around on my homely raft has become a little mundane and so I'm taking a break from this game until the next story update before it becomes tedious. 

What I love about raft is the unique blend of art and believability. Everything you craft looks like you crafted it with care as well as functionality but it also looks like something you could actually make with the required supplies. It isn't just random raw materials thrown together and suddenly you have something that looks like it just rolled off the assembly line. The finished product displays some flaws and that really adds authenticity, I feel.

This game is also so smooth and polished that I forgot it was actually in early access. Everything flows and looks so good you'd think it was a fully finished game which I think highlights the fact that smaller teams making something with heart is worth more than a mega corporation churning out half-baked titles for a quick buck. My only gripe would be the island enemies are very OP for someone under equipped or has no experience. A little tweaking there wouldn't hurt but that's really just a small issue.

I look forward to returning to this game and I definitely recommend it to anyone looking for a survival game with a unique gameplay element!"
29438,Was left very unsatisfied with the ending and the lack of things to do. No thank you. It's enjoyable through out but it's not worth full price or even discount price. Ending is a slap in the face with more content is coming. It's been out for 3 years. I'm sorry what?
29439,"very fun, very craft, very shark, very survive"
29440,fish yes
29441,"Raft = good, Bruce = bad"
29442,"RAFT is my top favorite survival game, and I am totally addicted to playing it! I love the challenge of staying alive, building my raft, and exploring the big islands to complete the story lines. I normally play on peaceful mode, which is my style and this is a perfect game for that."

29453,"THE GAME
"
29454,"Excellent game to play cooperatively!

The game doesn't explain much to you in the beginning, so you've kinda got to figure it out on the fly, and expect to learn by making mistakes (and being eaten by sharks). Somewhat buggy. First attempt at a coop game our raft disintegrated and the island we were on literally ceased to exist while we were in the middle of standing on it and we all were eaten. Second playthrough, some enemies (and me) clipped through the ground on several islands, and several times through the corner of the raft itself.

Despite the learning curve and few glitches, a game I would HIGHLY recommend to anyone that's a fan of resource management and exploration. Easy to learn new recipes for useful items on the research table, and a huge plethora of different recipes for decorations for the raft (you will collect MANY many of them while fishing for junk). Overall, a game I'm really looking forward to continuing to enjoy and get more of"

29461,"bruh, fantastic game, great crafting, exploration, and graphics"
29462,Fun game but i honestly wouldn't recommend it if you plan on playing solo unless you like a hardcore experience on a janky system. If you die you loose everything as a solo (no bag system like in other survival build games) and since the game has issues you'll probably die a bit.

29503,"The game has a fun and rewarding progression system in terms of crafting, but when you venture to gameplay outside of that bubble, it starts to have issues. Combat against the creatures that challenge you is stale and clunky at best, frustrating at worst. Furthermore, your survival within the combat side of the game increases with teamplay, but the problem arises where the more players you have, the less resources you can sustain. Without any significant updates to how combat works and actual incentives and/or changes for playing with others, I unfortunately cannot recommend this game."

29507,"There's a learning curve to start, and I found it unbelievably frustrating to try to sort out what the heck was going on, how to use the extremely limited tools I had, and how to start surviving.  Once that massive, massive, basic gate was crossed, the frustration dropped away and this game became a ton more fun.

It's crazy survival-fu starting you on a small grid of planks - fun and very stressful single player but a blast when you add friends who get what is going on, and as you figure out what tools you need and who needs to do what to stay alive, explore, prosper, and design your raft/boat, it becomes so much fun.  Highly recommend in spite of some very frustrating bugs.

BUGS: We've had land just freaking vanish under us and drop us into water nowhere near our raft.  We were able to at least get back to our raft through logout/login.  We've also had sharks clip through our boat (nothing got harmed other than the suspension of disbelief) but also lost our boat clipping through an island, to the point where we couldn't get back on it.  

Again, in spite of the bugs - and this is early access - my friend and I have had a blast playing this.  Great use of ~$15."
29508,"I like this game because it has a sandbox mode (called Creative mode), which means I can just build whatever I want and not worry about survival. I like games that let me relax and not worry about dying and my health dropping to 0."

29573,"It's pretty alright but if you have no friends and a not very good gpu then this game is probably not for you, I bought it and played for my friend for some time but my fps were 8-20 at the lowest settings. (I have 12 GB of ram and MX350 as a gpu) so I kind of don't recommend it."
29574,good game shit bugs die no loot on the ground  6/10

29578,"Raft is an amazing game, I'd recommend it 100%!
I bought Raft and another, similar but not to be named survival game, to play together with my boyfriend. We played the latter (not Raft) one for about 2 hours and we really tried to like it, but were completely disappointed. Usually I get addicted to games, where one can explore and craft pretty instantly, but that one just didn't do the trick. It had neither a great storyline, nor gerat mechanics and was a little buggy over all. And then we played Raft. And oh boy, Raft was everything the other game was not. I bought raft pretty much on impulse, so I didn't know what was awaiting me. At first I thought it was just cute and made with a lot of love and an eye for detail. I thought, the main goal was to float around, collect items and build your raft. Then we discovered the storyline and the game hit a whole other level. Even though the story line adds kind of a dark twist to the whole game, I really appreciate how it develops. The stories and hints are gloomy and grim sometimes, but they never lack humorous interjections. 
We currently only played the easiest setting, where one can explore freely without being troubled by sharks and creatures. I'm looking forward to start a second world with a little more fighting action. We are already very excited for future updates and story-chapters!"
29579,Really enjoyable game that balances survival and building elements really well and in an inventive way. The player can enjoy different difficulties as well as a creative mode where their building has no restrictions. There is a skeleton of a story as the player drifts through the ocean and comes across a variety of islands. The Islands contain resources and enemies that can further the players journey. It can be played alone or together and is especially fun with co-op. The only con Id imagine would be that it could eventually get a bit repetitive.
29580,Raft is a fun game for playing with your friends if you have any.
29581,very good game play
29582,"good

29583,mancing hiyuu
29584,This is a good game. It might be grindy but its good for me
29585,haha funny
29586,"I can not play with friends because network ping is very high, ping maybe up to 3000ms."
29587,"shark bit me bed, not nice"
29588,Do you like the thought of exploring the world but find you never stray too far from your base? Do you have a failing short-term memory and no sense of direction whatsoever? Then this is the game for you! Raft makes it so that you take your base with you wherever you go - and where you go largely does not matter! The story elements keep you from getting bored and the enemies are challenging until you learn how to deal with them. It's like Minecraft - except I am not constantly getting lost and losing my base forever!
29589,fla-mingo
29590,GOOD
29591,honestly this game is s.h.i.t the enemy's are garbage an the fact that you die an all you stuff just vanishes so you cant even go back to pick it up is stupid i understand not keeping is on death but the fact that you cant even go back for it makes no sense an some of the bodies just faze into the ground its okay with friends but playing solo its no where near fun just so much to worry about especially the water and food meter which deplete so fast an you get so little from food that it becomes a chore even after you eat cooked for you need to eat multiple time even the shark meat which is the most annoying food to get is also one of the better early foods just suck cause yeah they fill 1/4 of the bar you also eat to of the four you just got now running low an have to use the beets or potato which uncooked give you nothing unless you  wait till your character starves which honestly isn't a good place to leave you food bar
29592,It's a very nice game for playing with friends. I super recommend.
29593,"I got to beat a shark with a stick, I'm happy"
29594,"ok, this game is super fun with friends and only with friends, the mechanics and graphics are great, and most of the time there isnt any lag. a very calming peaceful game, to any players wanting to play coop this is a great game."
29595,after grinding and getting so far ahead in the game you'd expect some good or ATLEAST DECENT LORE as some sort of reward ... but no. All you do is loot and explore puzzling and annoying maps JUST TO LOOT MORE AND MORE WHILE YOU GET LOST AND CONFUSED ABOUT WHERE TO GO. The amount of grinding me and my friends did in this game only to be give such a god awful story mode is painful. Get this if you wanna torture yourself.
29596,Shark is friendly
29597,This is a very fun survival game. Love the multi-player feature. Cant wait to see the next chapter come.
29598,Loved The Main Story Of The Game!.
29599,I mean yeah why not it is very fun with friends but can be hard ok bye
29600,hell yes
29601,Not bad but confidently recommend to play with friends as solo can be found boring in specific times.
29602,ya its nice
29603,So much fun! Especially with friends! :)
29604,so fun

29622,"Fun game, but needs more to the story."
29623,"Great adventure and gameplay

29624,"Very fun Game!
If you have friends to play with it it can be so much fun!"
29625,"finished the game in 15 hours with a friend, at normal pace. 15 hours for 15 pounds? lasted us 3 days"
29626,If you like exploring... get this game. I am HOOKED... pun fully intended! It is just so interesting and can be chill or thrilling and hits a few emotions with the story line and just... Its amazing!
29627,The Sharks are Mean but other than that the games great :]
29628,i like raft's big rats
29629,Please make a version for other platforms
29630,"This game is amazing in every way, I will say if thou is playing on normal you may rage. Mods make it very funny."

29640,"Be careful!
Fell into the sea, they'll bite your ass off
You explore a big island, a boar hits you in the face from the bushes. From the sky, an overgrown rooster shat on you."
29641,"Absolutely love this game! I first got in to it with a couple friends to play every now and then but it soon became an addiction for me and i put probably about 50 hours in the game in about 10 days, if you are you looking for something casual to play with friends or simply just burn time this is the game for you. Simple mechanics mixed with small story give me major 2015 minecraft vibes for me."
29642,Super chill
29643,"For a game that's been early access for 2 years, the content released is not enough, basically crafted almost every essential stuff within a day. Hope dev will focus on in game progression instead of aesthetic like renovation update."
29644,very funny game i very like this game
29645,yes
29646,Honestly a pretty fun and chill game. I love it.
29647,Fun
29648,"Raft is a very peaceful, but yet shocking. Raft opens a new world for players. You can explore many different islands and find abandoned rafts for resources. Although it may be hard to find success, but Raft teaches you to never give up even if you're in a tough situation."
29649,Just another Early Access game that hasn't had an update in over a year.
29650,coo
29651,"So realistic, and fun! Highly recomended!"
29652,"To be honest, this is one the best early access games I’ve ever played. The soundtrack is so relaxing to the point I’ll often find myself drifting off to sleep. Then a few minutes later, I am either rudely awoken to the sound of a seagull destroying my scarecrow, or to Bruce, whom is once again eating my raft."
29653,fun

29670,"Fantastic game. I bought it on sale with a friend and at that point we had no idea what the game was like. No trailers watched, not anything. Played it for 26 hours so far and I'm having a blast. Fun, simple and addicting gameplay."
29671,"Raft je velmi jednoduchá, ale zábavná hra. Můžete jí hrát jak s kamarády, tak sami. 
Prakticky žijete na dřeveném raftu, kde si postupně stavíte další kousky vaší ""lodi"" či potřebné spotřebiče pro přežití. 
Pomalinku si sbíráte věci z moře, těžíte suroviny. Je možné, že hra po nějaké době omrzí, proto doporučuji hrát aspoň s jedním kamarádem. Hratelnost pěkná, obtížnost jednoduchá. 
Doporučuji, 9/10. ^^"

29673,Fun

29677,sexy
29678,good
29679,"Hello i've enjoyed the game very much its very intresting and fun to play, the only thing would be that it doesn't have normal servers like minecraft for example, instead only friends can join your game and only when you are in it. this is something that I would love to see switched to a more traditional server system as it would allow you to occasionally bump into other players which in my opinion would make this game epic! other than that I have no complaints, thanks for reading!!"
29680,It's a lot of fun to play on your own but it's more fun with friends
29681,"I like this game, have to be on a constant move but its enjoyable, what I don't like is that it takes a good bit of grinding for supplies. The shark is annoying at times but keeps you awake while on the ocean."
29682,pablo
29683,"i may have cumed over sharfk
why is my woman black
not a bad thing i love black women
i promise
my uncles ex wife was black"
29684,"The game is open world but with a story you can follow. You could play forever if you just play as an open world build game, but if you follow the story, the game is not very long but it is interesting. If you do a bit of both you could build an amazing ship from your starting raft and have a great time just doing that. I hope they add more content to it soon though."
29685,i love the survival and the danger
29686,suuiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiii
29687,"It's a fun game with unique mechanics of being on a raft, but you can still tell it's early access. They have been adding loads of content though! looking forward to the full game"
29688,Very good game for it only being in early acces.
29689,pog
29690,Nice game!
29691,So boring i have no idea how other people liked this shit

29698,"The game encourages you to explore land, but the game mechanics while on land are atrociously bad."
29699,a fresh take on the survival genre (no zombies lol)
29700,"This game can let me experience the pleasure of playing with my friends. It's really wonderful. But compared with playing alone, it is very monotonous. One person plays like a horror game, two people play is a happy game. I hope to update the game content in the later stage, so that I can live forever in the game world with my friends!"
29701,"insanely fun with friends, not fun alone so get at least a group of friends who are willing to play it consistently!"
29702,"Great game, brings new ideas to the gaming world that inspired other games. Very fun both multiplayer and singleplayer, multiplayer is better for advancing the game faster, and having fun with friends (or new friends you make from the discord server), singleplayer is a bit more grindy, but not as much, u'll always find something to do else rather than focusing on doing one long task, but still fun, and you get to explore everything yourself. Overall, game is 100% worth it, if ur not sure, play the demo on itch.io, still not sure, watch markiplier, best raft series I saw."
29703,the game that made you rage and laugh with your friends
29704,"it,s a pretty good game i like how it works it,s like minecraft but it,s on a raft i really RECOMEND THIS GAME."
29705,"Very enjoyable, though gets boring after a while if your friends don't talk much. So make sure you bring like hella talkative friends then you'll have a blast"
29706,Amazing game must buy
29707,Love it
29708,stop drop roll
29709,Just be patient if you want to enjoy this game.
29710,fun and relaxing like minecraft but differnet and looks different obv good game overall i would recommend
29711,"I love Raft! It's a laid back open ocean survival with a lovely art style, atmosphere and sound track. Resource collection, defending you and your raft from shark(s) and, of course, survival on the open sea. - You start on a simple small flat raft with a handmade plastic hook, from there it's up to you. Along the way you'll follow pieces of the plot leading you to story islands, giving you more bits of the lore (Yay, storyline!), blueprints to learn new craftables of all kinds (cooking, building, machinery) to update your raft, QoL and to help as you continue on your adventure. 

But don't let my use of the expression ""laid back"" fool you, with different difficulty modes - how laid back is completely up to you.

Some of the fun for me (and many in a rather large and growing Raft community) is building up my raft along the way; making it comfortable, livable and functional in a life alone (or with friends) on the ocean. 

The game is still in EA as I type this, but in all of my hours the worst bug I've personally come across is seagulls who don't understand the boundaries of walls/ceilings, but I know they're working on that... as they have any other bug. They seem like a very passionate dev team, a small team of 8 I believe it is, but a small passionate team that seems to be working hard to make Raft a great game. I have high hopes, and hours of entertainment that keep them there."

29736,"Raft is a very simple and fun game. I've been playing this with my GF and we've been having a blast. Communication is key, like in every other survival game. I would recommend focusing on gathering wood, plastic and palm leaves. Also try to gather and plant potatoes and beets."

29745,"These days, I'm not much of a gamer. No games seem to get me excited anymore or make me want to play for hours, but I can honestly say this is the best $20 I've ever spent. There's something so enjoyable and relaxing about building out your raft and learning how it all works. There's now something for me to look forward to after a long day of work, to come home and just play Raft for hours with the boys. I probably wouldn't play this game solo, but when you've got a crew of 3-5 where everyone has a job to do it's super fun!"
29746,This is a great learners game and I highley reccomend it to new players
29747,veri gud
29748,FANTAZTIC GAME
29749,"I really like this game. Played it with friends and had a good time. At the beginning it's quite hard to split resources among other players (like fresh water or food) but it still was fun.

Survival is dead simple, take care of food and water and you good to go.

I don't like main campaign. For me it's created to waste your time for searching and going back and forth. With food and water in mind you have to come back to raft couple a times.

Crafting is enjoyable and give you significant progress.

For me swimming was calm and give me a lot of fun."
29750,"[h1]Rating: 6/10[/h1]
I am playing this with my GF and it is perfect for relaxing and having fun. The music, although short fits well.

The development is rather slow. We bought this game early 2018. Since then, we are creating a new game from time to time to experience the added content. 
What has been added so far has been good and a pleasant surprise.
Definitely worth the full 14 Eur.


[b]Positive:[/b][list]
[*]Coop
[*]No bugs or crashes so far
[*]Decent music
[*]Relaxing gameplay
[*]Good building and raft customization
[*]Graphics, simplistic but looks good[/list]

[b]Negative:[/b][list]
[*]Slow development

Just be careful and don't ""accidentally"" leave your girlfriend on a small island while she is gathering way too many flowers."
29751,sheeeeeeeeeeeesh
29752,Maybe a bit repetitive after some time but would recommend to try out with friends.
29753,"Fun to play, steadily updating and absolutely full of love from the Devs. I cannot recommend this more! Alone the gameplay is a little slow going, the work feels lonely. However if you go into this just wanting to raft and chill out then your going to absolutely love it, collecting your materials and spotting islands is the meat of the game and very fun.  As long as your not rushing in then your gonna love it. 

Every single update is bringing out some amazing extra content to play, to build or enjoy!"
