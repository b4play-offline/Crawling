1,"     I enjoyed playing HL2: DM. A close friend of mine gifted me this game yesterday, and we played it for a few hours. The game was running great, as it was one of the fewest games I know that my computer can actually run. All in all, I enjoyed playing this game yesterday.
     Fast forward to now, I have been experiencing a black screen while the game loads. I restarted the program three times before I researched for solutions; however, none of the solutions worked, so I had to look for solutions myself. First, I tried running a compatibility troubleshooter; that did not work. Then, I tried reducing the color mode; that did not work either. Lastly, I tried running in 640 * 480; none of my solutions worked. I became discombobulated and eventually uninstalled the game.
     In summary, HL2: DM was a fantastic game I played; however, my experience of playing that game lasted one day before I recently experienced a black screen. There is no way I can solve the issue."
2,"Using the gravity gun in a multiplayer context is quite fun. However, this is an old game (from 2004) with a low population (peaks at around 200 concurrent players as of this writing).

Most players will find this in their library due to buying Half-Life 2: Episode One, the Valve Complete Pack, the Half-Life Complete bundle, or the Source Multiplayer Pack bundle. I had fun for the hour I played, though I'm not sure if I will revisit it."
3,Very fun game
4,it's good o\
5,you can't kill people with matches in this game so they dont cause death. false advertising 0/10
6,Takes me way back in my early gaming days when I was just a wee lad. Flicking toilets at each other and bantering with friends and randoms. Global match making and not supporting community servers killed online games.
7,Goooooooooooooooooooooooooooooood back in 2005 ;D
8,"swag
"
9,shit game
10,It makes me sad that no one plays this anymore.
11,Since I hate fps and online gaming it would have taken divine intervention or aliens snatching my body for me to like this game. This one is worse than most: long load times and demanding servers. No thank you.
12,why is this so addicting??
13,bwaaaaaa
14,"A classic, good for a simple unwinding, with gameplay that's both straightforward (shooting) and yet a bit quirky (physics and gravity gun encourage creativity)."
15,"It crashes lately and I dont know why :(
I am on linux 22.04"
16,Best Deathmatch Game! :)
17,the only multiplayer shooter you'll ever need
18,I killed somebody with a literal fucking toilet
19,this game be goofy as hell
20,Love this. Fuck you if you dont.
21,"Fast-paced, battle-royale-like gameplay with amazing weapons like the Gravity Gun, and expansive maps that you want to explore every part of. The most fun I've ever had in a game yet."
22,i was born before this game came out and its still good so go play it
23,i am going mentally insane
24,love it
25,Finally I can let go of my fear of getting a headcrab forcefully attached to my person
26,good game
27,still great fun all these years later.
28,Why is this so fun lol
29,Good old school HL2. Best way to kill some time.

51,I'm surprised it's still kinda active.
52,I player whit on server tops play no toing i say it game good whit it is players for agine on game half life 1 ? pvp... 563780006
53,"I guess its kind of fun to just run around a big map and kill other players with no other goal, but it just kind of gets boring after a few minutes. Also there aren't that many players on, but there will probably be a few decently full servers to join. You could probably have more fun doing the same thing in gmod."
54,lower the price so theres more players to kill
55,best fps game eva!
56,Pretty fun even in this day and age!
57,"Good old times ! 
old but still powerful memories!"
58,i couldnt find a match anywhere but I can use the gravity gun early so 10/10
59,This game is so motivational
60,very well made
61,No active vanilla servers. Could still be fun with friends though.
62,"I got this when the hl:a promotion was still up. To condense:
- Why the hell is it 5 dollars when it could have just ccame with hl2 similar to lost coast"
63,"Bad, i'm pretty sure i got a virus from it, joined a server, 2 seconds later killed by a Hacker, then called a dogshit baby in chat, don't play, all servers are like this."
64,"Very fun game to play with friends, especially with the ones that you want to smash a toilet into their head."
65,"The best way to describe this games gameplay would be.. TF2 deathmatch on methamphetamine.

Everything is chaotic and quick, every prop can be used as a weapon and about 10 deaths happen in the first 6 seconds of the game.
The in-game chat is either dead silent or is filled with people calling eachother boomers for playing this 18 year old game.

Bunnyhopping is possible in this game, also, ABH (accelerated back hopping) is usually disabled in most community servers.

There's usually at least 3-4 servers with at least 20 players.

And S.L.A.M mines are annoying as hell.

Edit: I also believe that this game should've been pre-packaged with half-life 2, like half-life 1 had its deathmatch mode in the main menu.
Or be made free-to-play, which is unlikely due to Valve not giving a crap about their older games."

113,"make hl2dm free to play valve, you might bring in some players :D"
114,yes
115,:(
116,"If you can manage to get a few friends in a server together, or you find a relatively populated server with low latency, it's definitely a lot of fun. The gravity gun adds so much flavor to the mindless shooting. When you manage to get a kill by flinging a toilet, a wall radiator, exploding barrel, grenade, etc., directly at someone's cranium at 100mph it is complete euphoria. It's a good nostalgia trip."

145,"I am a 45 yo father, probably one of the oldest people playing this game. I am a single farther to my Son, who is 14 now. My son got this game for Christmas from his uncle, so we installed it on his computer and he started playing. By the end of the week he had 24 hours on this game. This was horrible for me, as it was already hard for me to find ways to spend time with my son, as he is always out with his friends or just, watching YouTube. So i decided to make a Steam account and get this game to see if I could maybe play alongside him. loaded into the game, made my character and world and started playing but I was stuck on what you where supposed to do. I asked my Son for help and he hosted a game for me to join. loved it as it was the best time had spent with my Son since my wife had died. This game has ever since brought me and my son closer again and now we actually spend time together outside the house together as well. This game reminded me that there's fun to be had in everything, and it has brought both me and my Son many happy memories."

Timeless mechanics with a towering skill ceiling, plays great in 1v1 and full lobbies so as long as 1 other person is playing there's always potential for enjoyment.

Mandatory w/ every steam account as far as i'm concerned."
154,You can kill people with toilets. 10/10
155,the fact i can kill someone by flinging a toilet at them at 500mph already makes this infinitely better than CS:GO or Valorant ever wish they could be

It really doesn't differ much from the first Half-Life deathmatch aside from the graphics and weaponry. Oh and, rather than the 3 people that still play the first one this has 10x as many of a player base, so..30. I mean for a game this old I was pleasantly surprised to see active servers that are still receiving donations from kind folks who want to keep the Half-Life fire burning.

But of course in all honesty Garry's mod makes this game incredibly obsolete, as there is a server on there for probably anything you can imagine, meaning you can do what this game delivers and more. Although... murdering someone with a melon was incredibly satisfying."
264,"is very fun
"
265,"in short time i played this game, i joined a russian speaking server and got prop killed by a toilet"
266,Love it till this day
267,"GOOD GAME!
"
268,what i like from this game is that basically the game follows half-life 2 mechanics and transforms into a fps game deathmach.
269,"This game has brought together me and so many of my friends over the years. Though i did have to gift this game to them in order for them to get it cause they didn't want it at first, now me and my friends play it when ever we can!"
270,it was so good
271,better than every other half life game (they all suck)
272,garrys mod but not haunted
273,"Multiplayer with the Gravity Gun is a great idea in theory... but it doesn't work when the only servers playing official maps are far away from your location, making the gravity gun unusable due to lag, and with pay-to-win donator benefits. It comes for free with Half-Life 2 Episode 1, which is worth playing, so I wish there was a middle ""Informational"" rating that does not affect a game's score on Steam."
274,"Its a lot of fun, you can run it at old computer, and if you have some expirience with Hammer editor you can create your own maps. So perfect game in fact. I also like weapons."
275,Actually Fun
276,Best Shooter game of all time
277,Better than Gmod PVP
278,old game but is fun
279,boomer safari
280,Better than Counter-Strike: Deathmatch.
281,Party
282,this is the best game and if you dont think so you are wrong
283,"Good game, had many fun killing everyone with gravity gun and smg. Also, It was funny to hear some russian guys saying ""privet"" but if we speak about the gameplay itself, it could have been much better. If you'll ask me, should i buy this? The answer is: Yes, but only if in half-life complete pack or in other valve's packs."
284,"Throw toilets at people, have awesome battles and most important of all try to find a server. That's Half-Life 2 Deathmatch for you."
285,basiclly just cheap garrys mod.
286,fun but simpel

331,"I received it buying Half Life 2, so luckily I didn´t spent the original 4 bucks it costs in vain. The game is dead, since almost every game is empty or full of bots. I played 7 minutes and that was enough to teach me that Half Life isn´t meant to be played as a multiplayer. It´s better than HL: DS tho... but not because that it´s a good game"

354,"Really fun back in the day, still occasionally play. Talk about shooting up a dose of nostalgia. Great things can happen when developers make their multiplayer games open to modification. Co-op, RP servers, and such were always fun for 8 year old me. I appreciate when a game has modes you can just f*ck around on. Base death-match game mode is full of exciting moments. And flying toilets. The gravity gun is still the best weapon in any game I've played."
355,It's a good multiplayer shooter. 'Nuff said.
356,"i like hl2:dm

if you don't, 1v1 me in hl2:dm

hl2:dm roleplay servers are a weird part of our shared reality, they're like a worse version of gmod rp servers in every single way, but hl2:dm's rp servers are kinda quirky

but in all honesty, this game has no real playerbase anymore but it is nice to just download and play with friends for a lil while"

By and large, the interactivity is fine, (It's Half-Life 2 all things considered) the illustrations are alright, and the client count is utilitarian, however it's not difficult to see that it's waning.

By and large in late 2021, I'd say it's a 7/10 assuming you can track down a good measured entryway.
In the event that it's discounted and you're a fps/half-life fan, I'd say to try it out."
410,"So, lemme tell ya, this is the ""worst best"" game ever, i played for like 1 hour and i already know what type of game this is. literally empy servers. in some servers there are like 3 people playing deadmatch, in others there are 14 years old edgy kids talking in the voice chad and in some servers the admins just spends the whole day killing you for no particular reason. the gameplay is fun, i mean, its just hl2 weapons with some minors bugs; in this game there are a few bugs like characters randomly A posing and some weird weird  stuff. but if your interted there are some alive comunities (like COlD comunity) in the game doing some roleplay.
and of course sometimes you can find a deadmatch server or a team deadmatch and they are preatty funny.
I dont really know who plays it but meh. go for it if you want... at least its better than Deadmatch Classic."

424,"My experience with Half life 2 Death match was okay. There isn't much to do in this game as it only comes with a few maps and only comes with 2 game modes: Team death match and Free for all.  This game does contain modding support, so if you want to play with other custom map, go for it! Due to the lack of players, there is a bot mod called botrix. This game doesnt really have any progression in the game. You have to make them up and decide if this is really worth it. Honestly, i would get this game if it comes with a bundle, but that's it. :/"

430,6/10 hahaha ragdoll go burrrrr
431,"[h1]TL;DR[/h1]
Half-Life 2: Deathmatch is similar to Quake multiplayer but it is a less competitive game by nature. If you don't like how intense Quake multiplayer can be, HL2:DM may be to your liking instead.

Recommended!

[hr][/hr]

[h1]Main Review[/h1]

While HL2:DM shares many elements with other arena shooters, the biggest draw that sets it apart is the emphasis on weaponising physics with the Gravity Gun. Outside of interesting moment-to-moment gameplay due to the constant manipulation of props on any given map, it also gives the game a slapstick element to it makes the game very enjoyable, even when losing.

As for the negatives; the game was a rush job by Valve. There are a lot of small issues and omissions in the game that can be problematic, such as being able to easily distinguish between players in team modes, a lack of server-confirmed feedback due to the lack of hitsounds & hitmarkers, and an entourage of bugs that go from causing minor inconveniences (e.g. invisible weapons caused by players joining) to major gameplay issues (e.g. being stuck inside props on spawn, and the game client desyncing, causing phantom props that don't exist on the server and other players).

The good news, though, is that the community has filled for Valve's slack, and is still modding the game today, nearly 20 years later, with gameplay fixes and a plethora of custom maps and game modes.

Because of this, the game still has a population across the globe.

[h1]Conclusion[/h1]
Overall, once you find a server with your preferred game settings to hang out on, it's a good time. Recommended."
432,"Funny, speed, game! :D"
433,epic getting a toilet launched at your face and dying simulator
434,once got obliterated by a french guy
435,"It's okay, too simple though."
436,"Half-Life 2: Deathmatch is pretty simple, and I don't think that it really does a whole lot when it comes to innovation, but it's still pretty fun.
Overall, the gameplay is fine, (It's Half-Life 2 after all) the graphics are okay, and the user count is functional, but it's easy to see that it's dwindling.

Overall in late 2021, I'd say it's a 7/10 if you can find a decent-sized lobby.
If it's on sale and you're an fps/half-life fan, I'd say to give it a shot."
437,"its really great, even know.
the servers are full if youre lucky"

Half Life 2 Deathmatch throws all the HL2 weapons and throws you in an amazing selection of maps to fight in.
This game is the lovely old deathmatch styled games. You either kill, or be killed! No hiding like games nowdays. You are the man, the badass, the ♥♥♥♥. Skill is everything, not some weapon you need to buy for 5 dollars.
Half Life 2 Deathmatch takes the badassness to the next level. You get to throw toilet bowls at each other with the gravity gun and get to time frags like a boss.
Sadly, the fans of deathmatches aren't as popular as the past. So recommend this piece of badassery to your friends."
471,better than csgo
472,not fun after the first hour

Based on the information provided, can you guess what game this review is for? What's it about? What kind of game is it?

Point is, these reviews are completely interchangeable. I bet if you took this exact review, and copy and pasted it to every game in your library, you'd get the top review for half of the games you put it on, even if you didn't change the check marks to fit each individual game.

In my opinion, the Steam community should stop encouraging this format and instead downvote them all into oblivion. Maybe it's just me, and I guess it's not THAT big a deal, but for someone that puts at least some effort into the reviews they write, it is a little disheartening that the steam community prefers lazy checklists that ultimately don't say anything specific about the games in question. Plus I don't see how they could ever actually influence someone's decision to purchase a game or not when so little information is given.

Anyone agree or am I the only one that wants to read legitimately helpful reviews for games I might be interested in?"

475,"After release of Half-Life 2 there were not much of multiplayer shooters and for some years Half-Life 2 Deathmatch had its popularity. However, the later on most of players played Team Fortress 2 or Call of Duty 4 and as result I don't remember everyone talking about multiplayer of Half-Life 2 in the late 2000s... Still, many innovative elements of source engine of Half-Life 2 itself were shining also in its multiplayer, which makes it so cool. Especially the physics. The ability of lifting toilet bowl with gravity gun and sending it into your enemy killing him is priceless and also unic for Half-Life 2 Deathmatch."
476,funny gun go beeewwshshhhh and make filing cabinet go wheeeeeeeeeee
477,gg
478,It's aight
479,"LABOR OF LOVE!!

481,"Before I played this i had a big penis, two girlfriends and a lot of will to live. None of these things have changed, so I have no idea if this game is good."
482,very cpopol game i sell my penis for it
483,"I was called the n-word by a racist, GREAT GAME."
484,for lovers of halflaif series I recommend

486,The now-dead valve multiplayer game.
487,Hardest and funnest shooter-game ever made.
488,"Always fun to play, the low gravity or mouse maps are the best."
489,
490,A good game for some simple fun
491,Games still really fun even if the community is small and theres not alot of servers left but if you find one youll have a really fun time doing so not the best game in the world but not the worst (plus it was only made in 2 weeks) 7/10
492,"when I first met my 2 best friends of 7 years when I changed schools, this what we mostly played and still do occasionally to this day.

so many good memories"
493,I cannot recommend enough this game. Just pure fun mayhem.
494,timeless classic !!
495,"Russia should be banned from steam games, and they shouldn't play the games because they kill children and talk nasty about Ukraine. Please Valve, do something about this, they should be banned."
496,I always laughing when I kill some with a grenade and it is really good though
497,b o r i n g
498,"this is by far the worst game on the planet, i know the reviews says its ""good"" but its actually more shit then you would even imagine, nowadays this game is filled with hackers who put on fuckin godmode and call theirselfs ""gOoD"" if you wanna experience horror then launch this game and play it, i mean it isnt that bad the game used to be fair and square now the russians made the game bad and now its unplayable, do not buy this product its so bad please do not"

503,"This game is still kind of active from when I'm making this review. This is an easy game to get into. It's pretty straightforward. You know exactly what you're in for. If you want a game to waste an hour or two on, this is one of them. An hour goes by fast when you're playing this game."
504,it's half-life 2 but multiplayer
505,good
506,mediocre garbage.
507,Great nostalgic yet modern game.
508,(screams for 10 hours) Someone just b hop'ed to me and one shot me (IS THAT A THREAT)

516,good morning gordon 2: deathmatch
517,gaming
518,"It's literally hl2 but with a multiplayer/pvp mode lol, other than that its fun"
519,"Messing with the physics in this game was the selling point, more than the actual shooting. It used to be fun just hopping trough the map and headshoting people with the magnum or shotgun but now its just empty servers. That is the only reason I won't recommend it. No Singleplayer and no players to play multiplayer with, except if you have a few friends to mess around."
520,good game
521,it's like half life but people rage when you kill them
522,"Sono passati tanti anni da quando vidi la sorpresa della Valve dopo aver comprato half life 2 , l'aggiornamento di questo deathmatch. Dolce poesia.
Mi era rimasto da recensirlo e che dire ? Eravamo così entusiasti fra tutti della sorpresa. Ho passato diverso tempo on-line a giocare a questo titolo tirando vasi da cesso , ho giocato con i miei amici , ho giocato contro sconosciuti , ma devo dire una cosa , mai mi sarei sognato di giocare a HL2 in deathmatch !
Ora i giocatori sono andati da altre parti , nei mille videogame online che ormai dopo 20 anni sono su internet... ma c'è una cosa che ci accumuna tutti , il ricordo di quel giorno che Half life 2 diventò multiplayer !

Se volete provarlo e siete rimasti in 3 a non averlo provato , provatelo , perchè rimane un titolo che non invecchierà mai nemmeno tre 1000 anni. Basta un install, come ho fatto io e un PLAY.
(tra parentesi - viene ancora upgradato ... )"
523,Throw toilets at the alien race that crippled humanity in seven hours for an instant kill.
524,Great shooter if you just want to quick jump into the action. Multiplayer is still alive.
525,Half-Life 2: Deathmatch feels a little like Goldeneye with some Counter-Strike and a little bit of craziness. It is exactly what you would expect from playing a multiplayer version of Half-Life 2 and there is nothing wrong with that.
526,very good game worth 9.99 USD
527,"Servers can be high latency, but when you find a good one without it, it's fun to kick ass."
528,yes!
529,WAS ZUM FICK
530,It's K
531,"I mean I sorta like it, It just isn't that fun."
532,I don't think I've actually played it ever.    10/10
533,nice
534,about as source engine as you can get besides garry's mod
535,shit game
536,yes
537,it's half life but 2 but death match
538,"Fundamentally, there is very little to this game. It reminds all who play it of a time, a simple time. A time where battlepasses were nonexistant and screaming 10 year-olds could be muted at the push of a button. A time when developers weren't forced to ruin good games or drop support by greedy corperate. I've had a few steam accounts in my days playing this. Many friends i've had have come and gone. This all reminds me of the good old days, playing with friends on servers with a shitty little dell pc. 

This game aged fan-fucking-tastically well. I cannot recommend this game enough simply for the nostalgia it brings me and many others. 10/10"
539,Good Beans!
540,⠀
541,"It is Dead as it is, probably will be buried by the time you are reading this review. But it is still fun to play with friends or just bots."
542,"kinda munted
"
543,"Kinda dead these days, but still fun to play with friends or mess around with bots. I wouldn't recommend playing in servers, they're always loaded with custom content and a lot are roleplay-oriented, which is strange considering that Gmod has much more potential for roleplaying gamemodes and that this game literally has ""Deatmatch"" in its name. Oh, the default maps are pretty awesome too"
544,"It's old, the guns are either broken as heck or pea shooters, and half the time I don't even know what's going on.

Dang, I love this game."
545,"literally the most fun game ive ever played no exaggeration. i could play this game for hours and the fact that its only $5 makes it even better, this is the type of game i can play whatever mood im in."
546,30 minutes to load for it to be filled with wierd af stuff
547,Killing someone with a shit smeared toilet is always a delight!!
548,"Killed my friend with a toilet, shut game off, went to do something else."
549,"everything, a potato can run this game"
550,i just want to go back to 2007
551,"Childhood classic

563,"If you've played Half-Life 2, then you know know by now that the gravity gun is one of the coolest additions to recent video game weaponry. Using a superb physics model to their advantage, Valve created a weapon that can pick up any objects given physical properties and chuck them at an enemy. But when the sequel was finally released, many found themselves a little sad about the fact that they also couldn't huck pieces of trash, cabinets, sinks, and exploding barrels in the faces of friends and then merrily dance upon their battered corpse. Oh dear friends, now is the time to rejoice and begin practicing the dance of junky demise. Half-Life 2 Deathmatch has finally been released.

We realize that many of you have already played the game, but we also thought we might as well go ahead and write about it anyway, mostly because it gave us an excuse to jump in and play for a while. There were a lot of people clamoring for deathmatch since Half-Life 2 was released (including us), especially after getting a hold of that gravity gun. This release isn't going to turn the game on its head, but it sure is some good short term fun!

Along with the multiplayer code are two maps from the single player campaign reconstructed for multiplayer use. One takes advantage of City 17 (Overwatch) while the other brings players to battle it out inside a prison compound (Lockdown). While we haven't had extensive time on the maps, they seem well suited for the fast play style that deathmatch produces.

But as I've mentioned a couple of times now, the real draw of this particular deathmatch games is the ability to pick up junk and throw it at each other. It's hard to use any other weapons when there's so much debris sitting around just waiting to be used as death trash. It seems most people agree as a majority of users in each of the servers was toting some sort of item around. Chaos is probably the best word to describe the craziness."
564,A*
565,"Half-Life 2: Deathmatch attempts to translate the mechanics of Half-Life 2 into a multiplayer setting, creating a somewhat enjoyable arena shooter with lots of ways to defeat your foes. It can be very satisfying at times to break all your opponent's bones by launching physics objects at them, vaporize them using a Combine energy ball, outsmart them with a well-placed tripmine, or simply bludgeon them to death with a crowbar. Despite this seeming variety in gameplay, the game can feel quite basic in terms of mechanics and tactical options, creating an experience that feels perhaps too generic compared to its more modern contemporaries, especially with the lack of advanced movement tech (rocket jumping, bhopping) present in other, similar games. Half-Life 2's simple gunplay worked well in my opinion due to the purposefully-built level design and enemy encounters, but without most of that, Half-Life 2: Deathmatch feels more like a tacked-on multiplayer mode rather than a fully fledged game that stands on its own merits. The long tradition of Source Engine modding has allowed for lots of custom maps to be created, bringing some much needed spice to the gameplay, but unless you want to die repeatedly to people from across the map seconds after spawning, I would recommend staying away from many of the servers that host mostly custom content. Despite these issues, the game is still fun to play from time to time, which is what really counts, and can be a rewarding experience if you're able to get to the same skill level as the small, established playerbase.

7/10 - Worth trying if you get it in the Orange Box, not so much as a standalone game."
566,yea it gud
567,eat barrel nerd
568,so this is a really fun game and is worth every dollar :]
569,"Great fun with friends, but a lot of cheaters and shitty modded servers."
570,Good
571,"Serves are fun and the deathmatch rounds are super IN YOUR FACE and fast paced, still updated more than tf2 XD"
572,THIS IS SO MUCH FUCKING FUN HOLY CRAP
573,I have joined in the last 5 minutes of a match in some server and as soon as the match was over and Katy Perry music started playing I instantly closed the game and never touched it again.
574,"My homie LAMONT bought this for me and Its the best gift I've received.
Serves are fun and the deathmatch rounds are super IN YOUR FACE and fast paced 
Overall 10/10 
"
575,It's kinda cool
576,Total OG Classic! Still A Blast!
577,No life: 2nd in the series slayer
578,good for multiplayer
579,class and comfy and cool
580,If you can get a good voice chat conversation going while fragging each other it's a blast.
581,"Fight with trash like children of home country, with being on rout working factory."
582,"아직 게임을 구매할 능력이 없을 때, 무료배포판을 받아 재미있게 플레이한 게임.
지금은 대부분의 즐겜용 서버가 닫힌 상태이며,
pvp 대전용 맵인 Killbox만이 근근히 열려있는 상태다.
내가 플레이했던 때에는 낚시 맵이 흥행했다.
낚시바늘에 수박을 꽂고 물속에 던진 다음
낚시대를 흔들다보면 그 수박이 다른 물체로 바뀌는 원리였다.
하프라이프에서 맵을 따온 낚시 맵은 건전하게
헤드크랩이나 개미지옥 아주 희귀하게 무기상자 등이 나와서
평화롭게 낚시하고 있는 사람들을 학살하거나,
지뢰상자가 나와서 학살하려는 놈들에게서 자신을 방어하는 등
샌드박스 게임에서 흔히 볼 수 있는 난장판을 즐길 수 있었다.
근데 열대지방의 해변 맵에서는 DOA 캐릭터의 마네킹이 나오기도 했다.
피규어마냥 모으려는 놈과 그거 물속으로 날려버리려는 놈끼리
싸우는거 구경하는 것도 재밌었다.

리뷰 처음에도 말했듯이, 유저 수 자체가 크게 줄었기 때문에
 지금은 숨만 붙어있는 게임이다. 아직도 좋은 게임이지만은.
넥슨의 일랜시아나 어둠의전설 같은 게임이다.
그래도 무료이니까, 스팀에서 게임을 해보고 싶은데
돈이 없거나 하프라이프가 어떤 게임인지 경험해보고 싶은 학생들은
하프라이프 Lost Coast와 함께 이 게임을 한번 해보길 바람."
583,Good Battle
584,"Too many try hards, no updates, cheating is too easy and the servers suck with too many load times."
585,Steam will tell you I've only played this game for 3 hours. Don't believe them. I have played this game for millenia. its fgood game.
586,No thank you
587,gmod is better
588,"Well, it is pretty fun. It's what you'd expect, HL2 but online with a deathmatch mode. I like it, the servers have about 10 or 6 players. The community I met wasn't toxic, probably because I haven't played it much. I recommend it if you want to play HL2 online casually."
589,its good
590,6/10 I don't know what this is but it's more fun than GMOD RP servers.

605,"Its a good multi-player shooter game. Many modes and servers.
"
606,"I thought there would be no players but I found like 100+ players and 300+ servers. I enjoyed every minute of this game. 
 It would've be more populated if this game were not separated from hl2."
607,"Apparently, there are not much active servers anymore and in my opinion, the gameplay is too bland. Here's my advice: Play the original Half-Life deathmatch (the original GoldSrc one, not the Source version) or Garry's Mod instead."
608,"Well it's Half Life 2 Deathmach, nothing to much to be said, it's a great game and a fun experience. I do recommend it! :)"

620,its shit
621,"[h1]What I Dislike About It:[/h1]
[list]
[*] Lack of Innovation: No updates or gameplay that differs much, Nothing stopping the game from getting stale.
[*] Kind of a bummer that you can't play as any of the main characters in Half-Life 2.
[*] Many glitches and bugs that could probably be easily fixed by Valve.
[*] Some weapon animations are a little long and restrict weapon combos and make the combat a bit sluggish.
[*] The AUX power is not well suited for deathmatch and drains too quickly, bunny hopping is a great way to counter this but a game should not have to rely on a mechanical exploit.
[*] No bots support, even know bots will appear in the server browser for some reason.
[/list]
[h1]What I Love About It:[/h1]
[list]
[*] Half Life 2: Deathmatch is a very competitive game and is rich in its gameplay.
[*] The maps are easily iconic and memorable, with their colored lighting, layouts, and themes based on Half-Life 2's settings.
[*] The weapons are great for deathmatch all having a unique purpose in combat.
[*] The gravity gun absolutely steals the show with this ability to to be used as a tool and a weapon, Its effectiveness can all rely on your creativeness. You can shoot any physics prop at an enemy and it can also shoot props at and enemy that shot a prop back at you. You can grab weapons and health from a short distance and even carry them around the map if you are at full health or ammo.
[*] HL2DM has a great competitive and modding community
[*] The physics make the combat and gameplay unique, with most things being controlled by physics, your experiences could be new everytime
[/list]

And the most important feature of all:

[b]You can kill people with toilets![/b]

647,"really this would be a lot cooler if it was included in halflife 2, and im sure that would bolster its popularity as a niche silly multiplayer shooter. it vibes really hard of gmod, and id recommend that over this, but for how cheap it is on sales, there isnt much point in not getting it for a little bugger about every now and then. dont play on russian servers they are filled with nutjobs who have 2k hours and are literally completely cracked at the game"
648,classic shooter
649,"the servers nowadays are god-awful

and i cant play normally without some 12 year old using the explosives on me because they can't aim correctly"

655,H_L 2 Deathmatch is an engrossing game that relaxes my mind for an hour or more.
656,"Still highly playable, so of course i recommend it - although i personally prefer the weapons in HL1, so i think i have to get ""Black Mesa""... Better graphics is of course a nice bonus with BM, but IMO, even the graphics on HL1 is good enough to make it a strong competitor to HL2 (considering i prefer those weapons)."

672,lots of bug
673,"If you love half life and PVP games,
Play this I dare you.

So I got this from buying HL2 EP1 and found it in my library then I decided to taste it.
The weapons are completely from Half life 2 And There is 2 additional weapons only for this game, The Stun stick and And the umm, it's pretty much like a mine.
And no, it's not that  ""dead"" this game still have pretty enough people playing, There are 150 Players avg to play with.

The thing I only don't like is you need 10 shotgun shots at a really close range to drop them dead. So if you have a chance [b]Use a crowbar.[/b]
And the rest of the game is just very enjoyable.

708,Classic death match action from a classic game. Can't beat gravity gun kills.
709,"[h1]Why i buyed that beautiful game[/h1]
i will buy it, i played it when was free lmao

[h1]Why should you buy it[/h1]
it haves half life and deathmatch"
710,"Half-Life 2: Deathmatch is the multiplayer component of Half-Life 2. It's basically Counter Strike: Source but with a gravity gun.

The gameplay is very similar to other Source games such as Counter Strike: Source. As mentioned, the most significant change is the inclusion of the gravity gun that allows you to pick up and hurl items such as barrels.

The standard maps and player models are taken from the Half-Life 2 campaign. Sadly, there is no option to play as Gordon Freeman or the G-Man by default.

I don't really have too much to say about this because it is just so similar to Counter Strike: Source. This maybe more a game to mess around with rather than playing competitively due to the gravity gun allowing for some less traditional FPS action.

Gameplay: 7/10
Graphics: 7.5/10 (for the time)
Controls: 8/10
Replay Value: 6.5/10"

718,"Probably full of cheaters, such is the case with a lot of valves multiplayer games, must be a sales / marketing decision to do such a poor job of it. *slow claps*"
719,"Brainless furniture throwing, Half-Life is once again much better at solo games and moddable engines than multiplayer."
720,A great deathmatch game that lets you use the things from half life 2 against each other

722,"It's pretty good for an old game, it can keep me in front of the screen. Of course, it has many shortcomings, but the pleasure it gives to the game makes up for all the technical errors. There is no scenario in the game, you just shoot at what comes in front of you, weapons, location designs, and characters are compatible with the main story, which is better, but I guess the player will get bored after a while because the game always repeats itself."
723,"It comes with HL2:EP1 so at least try it


how is this so fucking good"

736,Good game.
737,great game for all time

I don't recommend this game because there are not many players and the only ones are tryhards that they are going to be mean with you.I wouldn't say do not buy it but it gets boring after playing it for a few hours , but i am not a person to stop you. This is a simple recommendation.But I would recommend to save your money."
747,amogus
748,"The game is very poorly balanced with the game's weapons being exactly the same as the ones found in hl2.  Explosives and crossbows are annoying because they instant kill.

Most of the servers suck and have very bizzaire plugins which make the game even more unplayable.

Pretty much every map sucks in some way and allow for annoying cheese strategy. 

Why do I recomend this game then? Because its fun, lol. If you like arena FPS and have some cash to burn this is not a awful way to spend your money."

And don't tell me ""oh its because the game's from 2004 because Gmod came out in 2006 and joining a friends game is way easier than trying to fucking join here nobody's any kind of help on Reddit or even the steam forums. its baffling how dick hard it is to just have some fun your your friends. they advertise this like you can play with your friends well, I FUCKING CANT!  if someone can tell me how to play with friends in a detailed and through way, ill change this rating but for now HELL NO."
764,it is really good but if you get into a server with too much tryhards to join that server
765,"This game is a hidden gem among the deep heart of steam's heart.
Half Life 2 Deathmatch throws all the HL2 weapons and throws you in an amazing selection of maps to fight in.
This game is the lovely old deathmatch styled games. You either kill, or be killed! No hiding like games nowdays. You are the man, the badass, the ♥♥♥♥. Skill is everything, not some weapon you need to buy for 5 dollars.
Half Life 2 Deathmatch takes the badassness to the next level. You get to throw toilet bowls at each other with the gravity gun and get to time frags like a boss.
Sadly, the fans of deathmatches aren't as popular as the past. So recommend this piece of badassery to your friends.
10/10 Can shoot toilet bowls"
766,YES
767,"This game is a amazing online game which expands the half life 2 secondary characters into a team fortress like enviroment. This game expands from the first deathmatch game with more maps and more playable characters, The game plays amazingly over all but I do have a issue. I feel like more of the main cast of half life 2 should have been in it like Gordon or Alyx. It honestly felt about weird seeing the main characters from the games not in it. Over all it is a solid 9/10. I hope valve make half life alyx deathmatch."

801,"Even though it's simple as hell it's just straight up really fun. I still feel like this should have been included in base Half-Life 2 however as a gamemode in the base game like it was in the first game. If there was a technical limitation not allowing them to put it in for whatever reason, then they should have at least made this free for owners of base Half-Life 2. Still fun as hell though and I really think the SLAM is a awesome addition that I think should have been included in the base game (the Stun Baton is not particularly useful however but I don't believe it's addition hurts the game in anyway regardless)"

811,"It's really, really good and underrated."
812,Good game to be sure but dislike (not all bots) the real nasty bots. Don't understand why they even play and seems like a legal way to cheat but play it just the same and you will like it.
813,"Half-Life 2: Deathmatch is a game very similar to something like Garry's Mod or CS: Source but it runs on the HL2 engine. It is a very dead game with around 20 active players at a given time. Because of this, the community is small and knit together. Everyone knows everyone. Definitely worth the money if you buy it along side HL2: E1. If you ever decide to give it a shot, try the Fusionhead Jazz Club server. Its the most active server with lots of players and lots of quality maps in rotation. Have fun!"
814,yes game
815,"This game has held up over the past 17 years and the community isn't that toxic, people still do play this game and people have done so much with it. The game even have RP servers. So play now before something like Half-Life: Alyx Deathmatch comes out."
816,"It's like Garry's Mod, minus the sandbox part.
While I like games like Team Fortress 2, Counter-Strike: Source, and Day of Defeat: Source, this game is truly the best to just relax and play, as there are no set objectives other than killing people.
10/10

820,"This game is really good! It's hard to find a classic deathmatch game anymore, and being Half-Life, you could carry your campaign experience over to this game too! I like the lack of microtransactions, this way I can play the game without the constant want of advantages/cosmetics that cost money. Definitely would recommend this game to anyone interested in deathmatch-type shooters."

844,"I just wanna start out on my old account i have over 3000+ hours on it from 07 to 11. To start off hl2dm has a very special place in my heart has it was a introductory to my PC gaming adventures back in late 2007 that's when steam had the classic green. UI layout. miss those days!! Anyways... I digress.

I remember the first map i played on it was dm_star_wars_v4 and i was absolutely astounded seeing a map that was completely custom. Being very young at the time the way I played half life 2 before was on the OG xbox and never had a PC. I became very addicted to hl2dm at the time.... I remember getting hooked on killbox servers and awesome coop servers like bouncyball which is still running today which is very impressive. and with those servers with the js_build maps were fun as hell to me back then. They always felt very unique to me.

Used to hangout on phoneburnia zombies servers all the time and my personal favorite map from them was z_tower i think it was called. It's very unfortunate this game isn't as popular as it used to be, it really is. it is still fun to hop on this game every now and then but I can't seem to get into this game like I used to. This game like i said is still fun to play it still holds up today but just isn't active as it used to be. You can find servers to play on with plenty of people, no shortage on that. 

Thinking back on the old days when it used to be so much fun to play on kind of feels depressing. I really wish I could go back and experience everything all over again. 2007-2011 were truly the funnest days on this game. But thanks to valve and all the updates to source this game won't ever feel the same. 

Thank you for all the fun fucking times. I truly mean it."
845,very cool but boomers sometimes ruin my fun
846,si
847,"I liked the game but I feel like the servers for it arent as main stream as back in the day
I would rather play the old deathmatch that was actually on the original Half Life"

852,"No players/bots = No reason to play.
If this was attached to the main game (like Opposing Force having its own DM/CTF mode) then maybe more people would remain active since HL2 is still a popular game today.

Simmilar to Dystopia, You're most likely only gonna get it if you need assets for Gmod."
853,"Good game, still active players on it."
854,Hl2 classic deathmatch like in old HL1 time.
855,"Custom server renamed the rocket launcher ""propelled cringe"" .

Very accurate."
856,"this is a good game


play on pirates cove"
857,this game was revolutionary in many ways
858,the title says it all. hellish russian servers.
859,very nice
860,yes
861,Not bad at all I must admit...
862,I only installed this for extra Garry's Mod maps. I would rather just play Half-Life 2.
863,Good
864,toothpick
865,e
866,It just crashed lmao
867,I liked this game. Great review.
868,it's half life 2 but deathmatch!
869,"You would need a group of friends you know to make this game fun.
I don't recommend buying the game and instead getting it with the Orange Box pack,
   1. Not a lot of servers with active people
   2. Making a server yourself for any source game does take a while
   3. Not a game you would play for long as it's small
Although, it is still good if you're lucky. Get a good server and a good amount of people and your set.
"
870,"Classic, fast paced, intense. I love it.  Grew up playing the Half-Life games and the dm modes."
871,game is pretty 1337.
872,When you find a server with a normal map it's fun
873,ok
874,I shot a toilet at 300MPH at someone and they fucking died
875,"It's a pretty good game. There are some neat gamemodes other than Deathmatch as well. Co-op puzzles, DarkRP gamemode (Very strange. I played it quite a bit in 2016 and 2017 and it was neat, but everybody on it was retarded and gave me Second Life vibes), decently well-scripted Sandbox, an old fishing gamemode I just tried and found somewhat interesting, but the server was empty so I got bored quickly."
876,Absolutely YES!
877,bet
878,"absolute garbage, would rather watch my only infant child choke on their own vomit than ever play again"
879,cool game
880,Was quite fun but it's kind of dead but you might find some servers with a few players or a ton of bots
881,"warning: it says free because it comes with half life 2 episode one

best multiplayer game!






valve plz add steamworks"
882,Not many people play it anymore but grabbing a toilet and throwing it at your friend at the speed of Mach 5 and watching them launch into the wall breaking every bone in their body will always be comical.
883,"Many Hours of ""Destroy your Life-Friends"".. :D"
884,if you can get a game going it classic deathmach fun
885,i dont play it much but its pretty good
886,is still alive to this day and age
887,"If you can find a server with people to play on, this game offers a fast-paced multiplayer arena fps. It's pure chaos and pure fun."
888,Poggers
889,It's a good game.
890,"Damn, this is pretty good!"
891,"Terrible addition to the Orange Box, unlike its older brother, Half-Life Deathmatch: Source, I do not recommend."
892,Really only good for exploring old abandoned servers.
893,"Many of us are familiar with such multiplayer online games like Counter-Strike. Now imagine the goodness of the Source engine and Half-Life 2 in such a multiplayer game and you have Half-Life 2: Deathmatch. When Half-Life 2 was first released, there was no multiplayer. This acts as its multiplayer, which was first bundled with Counter-Strike: Source,  this is an awesome game and definitely worth the value.

- Gameplay :

The premise of the game is simple: kill or be killed as the Rebels or the Combine. There are two game modes available, a free-for-all Deathmatch, or a team Deathmatch. It's sad that there are only two game modes, but the fast-paced killing will make you forget it anyway. There's a much different stratagem than Counter-Strike; while CS will emphasize standing still to increase your accuracy, it will get you quickly killed in Deathmatch, which emphasizes constant movement and continuous attack.

The official maps are all influenced by Half-Life 2 levels, ranging from a Combine experimentation lab to City 17. There are seven official maps to choose from, all very well made, as well as the myriad user-created maps to join. As such, there's plenty to see and try out in Deathmatch.



- Graphics and Sound : 

As can be expected, Half-Life 2: Deathmatch takes the amazing sound and graphics from the main game. The environments look fantastic, and if you do get a chance in between dodging cars and toilet bowls take a look around you. All the weapons sound amazing, like they did in Half-Life 2. After all, what would you expect from the Source engine?"
894,"Good ol' fun

Because its a 2004 treasure truly amazing with these sweaty ass 40 year old men playing SINCE THE DAY THIS GAME FUCKING CAME OUT. the end."

917,"Cool to check out since it comes with HL2. This wasn't my thing back in the day, but there are still (at time of writing this review) sometimes people in servers and they seem to be having a good time."
918,idk but the servers feel empty. It feels like you are walking normally at a ghost town.
919,Played it back in 05. Recently built a gaming PC and guess what game I downloaded first? YUP. Dominating!!!!
920,"I would give it a  YES, but it's not nearly as awesome as it was back in 2007 - 2009.
I played it alot, every single day / night on the account i had back then.
This game was given for free to anyone who had ATI / Nvidia graphics card
and there was an offer to redeem this game for free...
I think i spent like 3000 hrs of my lifetime on it..

This game was awesome with thousands of people playing on some
radnom coop or dm servers... too bad with it's updates, admins of the servers
and map modders have had given up on updating them... and then the GMod came in, 
then everybody swapped to it....

Other than that i am giving it a No.
Too bad... 3 / 10"

925,The only thing you'll find in this game are annoying fucking idiots who literally only play this game and think they're good when in fact they're not really good at any other game.
926,Go play HL1 Deathmatch
927,The best steam out game there is.
928,its lot fun and so cool like too play with some time
929,love this game . i started playing it when it first came out and i still play it
930,"One of the best multiplayer fighting games I've ever played. What makes it so special are the mechanics of the game itself, that are very fast-paced, hard but rewarding to master, original and - most importantly - very fun.
Just the gravity gun is an incredible tool in PvP that could either be used as an extra edge in fights thanks to its combo potential or as a proper weapon. There's also tons of stuff you can do and learn thanks to the Source Engine; such a shame this game is almost dead."
931,Good game!
932,its kinda funny

953,"I like how much the graphics have improved since I last played. It is easy to maneuver and change weapons. Once you get the hang of it, it's a blast. Just remember to always be moving and have fun."
954,good one
955,"Takes a nice spin on classic hl2 combat by pitting you against other players who are just as powerful as you are, very fun.

However unless you can find a server with people playing on it (and with low enough latency) or have a few friends to spare, then it's not too good as it relies on it's multiplayer, and there aren't usually that many people playing it.

If you want to get it, I'd recommend getting it on sale or with either the half life pack or valve pack (on sale of course)."
956,This one can get really fun especially with a group of friends.
957,fucking amazing m8
958,"sometimes annyoing , when you get the hang of it , its hella fun
"
959,"Janky broken piece of sh*t that's somehow still more fun that most modern shooters on account of bunnyhopping and twitch mechanics. In it's current state you'll mostly find roleplaying and low gravity servers with every weapon being an instant kill. But, if you can luck out and find a stock server running lockdown it's worth a quick revisit to stomp some noobs that can't bhop who will promptly ragequit. 9/10. I took a point off for source engine's atrocious hit registration and Valve updating the game to the orange box engine, effectively breaking movement. Still better than Overwatch."
960,really fun chaos when you find a server with people
961,i have no clue if anyone even plays this game anymore
962,just like half life 2 but you kill your friends its awesome i can challenge people
963,"morgan feeuman ge oshiter

964,"idk why, but my mouse dpi is incredibly high and only in this game. if i didnt have a logitech mouse with buttons to fix this, this would be unplayable."
965,easy
966,Bang pow boom
967,"Great graphics, enjoyable overall and I spent a reasonable amount of time on it on another steam account because it was good fun.

However, I am somewhat at a loss to explain why I was mostly number 1 in half-life multiplayer games for the 5 years after it was released and always in the top 5 but find myself struggling to get kills at all in this game online. It is still fun, but I just do not know if I am too old to compete or there is some kind of trick to it that I cannot deduce."
968,"classic half-life vibe, most relaxing game I ever played. Good community too, alot of custom maps that offer alot more to the game"
969,4/10 no
970,Great game.
971,Perfect office game.
972,I HAVE THE POOOOOOOWWWWWWWWWEEEERRRRRRRRRRRRRRR
973,It is a good game but is very old but thats ok
974,"A truly amazing game, you can have fun with friends, strangers, or make new friends. It's very fast paced and tons of different strategies to try against your opponents. Try to stay away from low-grav/high-kill servers because they're not as fun (for most), head over to SoCal #1, we've got a friendly community and would love to have new members.

This is an all around fun game for everyone who has the patience to learn the ins and outs of using the gravity guns and other weapons as well as the movement."
975,i killed someone with a computer would recommend

Not a bad game but it isn't worth purchasing on its own."

999,Best Game Ever. Nothing has ever come close.
1000,Absolute Classic and always a Blast . New or old to the games its always a blast . Run son older machines to which is great .
1001,boring
1002,A true master piece in multiplayer game with such a balance of a meta with props and guns that just stew into a perfect balance that can not go unnoticed. The way the props in and of themselves have such a unique balance and blend to them and how in depth the prop throwing mechanic as a whole is implemented is quite astounding. Between the more elegant and easier small props and the more tanky and bulky props that certainly can do damage on the map but are easier to grab and counter. The pristine and tight gun controls in the game can not be understated as well as each gun can be mastered in its own unique place in the sand box. The power positions on the maps are so smoothly crafted and well balanced so that its an advantage but not frustrating to fight. Truly a triumph in multiplayer games
1003,"Awesome game! There is a great RP server called ColdCommunity, highly recommend checking it out. Alot of really cool and chill ppl there!!"
1004,LItty
1005,"I am 27.

My ex-wife and I have a daughter together, and adopted our son together. They are now both 4 years old.

When we were going through our separation, I found myself lost and miserable. I was self destructive. I got so mad one day from everything spiraling out of my control that I punched some concrete in a moment of overwhelming emotion. That caused me to break my 5th metacarpal in my right hand... my working hand... my games hand.. the hand that I held and carried my children to bed with.. The hand I desperately needed to make sure I could continue to provide.

After learning of the severity of my self-inflicted damage, I was borderline suicidal. Keep in mind that just a few months before this, I was the happiest man with no history of depression or anxiety. I have never had fits of rage, or been one to break down and cry, but I was in a low spot that just really buried me from being able to see the light on the other side.

Having nothing better to do, I searched for a game I could play, ONE HANDED while I recovered. I somehow stumbled upon this game and read some of the reviews. I decided that it had to be worth a shot... I must admit, I didn't beat the game, or play nearly as long as some of you. In fact, I may have only played this game a day or two.. With that being said, after doing so, I had a new found joy and hope for life. I was able to put behind me the pain and suffering that had been cast over me. I was able to experience other peoples joy and happiness. I was able to see the fruits of my ""labor"". I relaxed for 5 fucking minutes to this music long enough to realize that I was going to be okay.

After coming to that realization, I turned the game off, and I went back to work. It hurt my hand like hell but I was motivated. I stopped feeling so damn sorry for myself, and I became the father I needed to be in that moment, not the weak boy I was behaving as.

Today, I am close friend with my kids mother. We don't fight, or argue, or say hurtful things to each other. We are parents, and friends.

I now have 3 kids. My third child is, wait for it, ALSO 4 YEARS OLD. The woman I am with was going through a very similar situation at the time of my own separation, and we just stumbled in to each others life unexpectedly. We have been in a relationship for a year now, and are very happy together.

Moral of the story, you never know what life holds in store for you, and if I would have given up when all the odds were stacked against me, I wouldn't be where I am today. This silly little game helped me realize that.

Thank you"
1006,good!
1007,I can recommend it!
1008,"It's all about mistrust, misdirection, and paranoia."
1009,Insane how a video game made a decade and a half ago can still be so fun. Definitely worth picking up and trying if you have a group of people to play it with.

1011,weird
1012,help
1013,"Its Real Legend, i playing this game from 2013 year and i like it, sometimes i crying 100/100"
1014,"It's quite decent and fun to play especially with friends. However, this game is not relevant to buy anymore and the servers are dead. The game is simple and it's based on the ""deathmatch"" game-mode as you would probably know from the game title. This game still gets a thumb up from me for its fun gameplay. Especially for it's time.

1070,"r/Bee Movie Script - Dialogue Transcript

  
According to all known laws
of aviation,

  
there is no way a bee
should be able to fly.

  
Its wings are too small to get
its fat little body off the ground.

  
The bee, of course, flies anyway

  
because bees don't care
what humans think is impossible.

  
Yellow, black. Yellow, black.
Yellow, black. Yellow, black.

  
Ooh, black and yellow!
Let's shake it up a little.

  
Barry! Breakfast is ready!

  
Ooming!

  
Hang on a second.

  
Hello?

  
- Barry?
- Adam?

  
- Oan you believe this is happening?
- I can't. I'll pick you up.

  
Looking sharp.

  
Use the stairs. Your father
paid good money for those.

  
Sorry. I'm excited.

  
Here's the graduate.
We're very proud of you, son.

  
A perfect report card, all B's.

  
Very proud.

  
Ma! I got a thing going here.

  
- You got lint on your fuzz.
- Ow! That's me!

  
- Wave to us! We'll be in row 118,000.
- Bye!

  
Barry, I told you,
stop flying in the house!

  
- Hey, Adam.
- Hey, Barry.

  
- Is that fuzz gel?
- A little. Special day, graduation.

  
Never thought I'd make it.

  
Three days grade school,
three days high school.

  
Those were awkward.

  
Three days college. I'm glad I took
a day and hitchhiked around the hive.

  
You did come back different.

  
- Hi, Barry.
- Artie, growing a mustache? Looks good.

  
- Hear about Frankie?
- Yeah.

  
- You going to the funeral?
- No, I'm not going.

  
Everybody knows,
sting someone, you die.

  
Don't waste it on a squirrel.
Such a hothead.

  
I guess he could have
just gotten out of the way.

  
I love this incorporating
an amusement park into our day.

  
That's why we don't need vacations.

  
Boy, quite a bit of pomp...
under the circumstances.

  
- Well, Adam, today we are men.
- We are!

  
- Bee-men.
- Amen!

  
Hallelujah!

  
Students, faculty, distinguished bees,

  
please welcome Dean Buzzwell.

  
Welcome, New Hive Oity
graduating class of...

  
...9:15.

  
That concludes our ceremonies.

  
And begins your career
at Honex Industries!

  
Will we pick ourjob today?

  
I heard it's just orientation.

  
Heads up! Here we go.

  
Keep your hands and antennas
inside the tram at all times.

  
- Wonder what it'll be like?
- A little scary.

  
Welcome to Honex,
a division of Honesco

  
and a part of the Hexagon Group.

  
This is it!

  
Wow.

  
Wow.

  
We know that you, as a bee,
have worked your whole life

  
to get to the point where you
can work for your whole life.

  
Honey begins when our valiant Pollen
Jocks bring the nectar to the hive.

  
Our top-secret formula

  
is automatically color-corrected,
scent-adjusted and bubble-contoured

  
into this soothing sweet syrup

  
with its distinctive
golden glow you know as...

  
Honey!

  
- That girl was hot.
- She's my cousin!

  
- She is?
- Yes, we're all cousins.

  
- Right. You're right.
- At Honex, we constantly strive

  
to improve every aspect
of bee existence.

  
These bees are stress-testing
a new helmet technology.

  
- What do you think he makes?
- Not enough.

  
Here we have our latest advancement,
the Krelman.

  
- What does that do?
- Oatches that little strand of honey

  
that hangs after you pour it.
Saves us millions.

  
Oan anyone work on the Krelman?

  
Of course. Most bee jobs are
small ones. But bees know

  
that every small job,
if it's done well, means a lot.

  
But choose carefully

  
because you'll stay in the job
you pick for the rest of your life.

  
The same job the rest of your life?
I didn't know that.

  
What's the difference?

  
You'll be happy to know that bees,
as a species, haven't had one day off

  
in 27 million years.

  
So you'll just work us to death?

  
We'll sure try.

  
Wow! That blew my mind!

  
""What's the difference?""
How can you say that?

  
"
1071,Fun game
1072,"Not relevant to buy anymore, dead game. Still gets a thumb up for its fun gameplay especially for its time."
1073,"it is WAY TOO MUCH FUN
for example: the ragdolls, the explosives combined with the ragdolls, killing people WITH A GRAVITY GUN and way more"
1074,It is fast paced.
1075,"somehow still good, only problem is that you have to find a good community server."
1076,favourite part is the fishing gamemode
1077,40 year old Belgian whore pub-stomping. That should say enough
1078,"you can throw toilets at people and actually kill them
10/10 would buy again"
1079,if you want a multiplayer experience look to gmod
1080,the best
1081,Great game.
1082,Most broken game I've ever played but by far one of the greatest. 10/10 would recommend and I'm wondering if we can posthumously nominate it for GOTY.
1083,Thumbs up if you still play this in 2020.
1084,great
1085,"Just classic deathmatch in HL2's combat system, simplistic and enjoyable, also easy to get used to while also having a masterable area"

1091,i dont know if im good at the game... was still fun tho ngl..
1092,"I hate this game because all of my friends are half-life 2 deathmatch tryhards.
Would recommend."
1093,i die a lot
1094,This game is very awesome!
1095,u can throw toilets at people what else do u need
1096,"Score: 7/10 - GOOD
Fun, simple, fast-paced multiplayer action that can be enjoyed as a quick diversion. I remember having lots of fun with HL2 Deathmatch when it was popular online in the mid 2000's. Many servers have custom maps which are automatically downloaded when you join, and some of those maps have features and artwork that make them distinctive and memorable. I just wish the rocketlauncher wasn't so ridiculously overpowered, and that there were more features like statistics, instant replay, and built-in customization options."
1097,h
1098,not so bueno
1099,"A very unique multiplayer experience. The rules of each individual server, and the nuances of movement, maps, and weapons make for a fun, chaotic experience that anyone can be good at."
1100,"good, but hard to find vanilla servers"
1101,"Really outdated. But the biggest problem is with this game using the worst mechanic from Half-Life 2, the combat."
1102,"Quite a fun game, at least for a few hours. The online community is surprisingly alive. I'd recommend hopping in for at least a match or two, just to see what it's like."
1103,good game gase it`s my 1 love games
1104,It's neat

1114,"I can dream about you
If I can't hold you tonight
I can dream about you
You know how to hold me just right"
1115,"This game is really boring no one plays it anymore and it sucks. My advice play Black Mesa, Half-Life 2, Half-Life 2 Ep1, Half-Life 2 Ep2. These are all great games but the online is bad. Half-Life is a great game to btw but is very stress inducing in my experience so go with Black Mesa it is a fantastic remake."
1116,"yaboiiiiiiiii
"
1117,"used to play this game all the time when i was younger but it for sure held a place in my heart as a classic way to play half life 2 story with friends or play custom maps people used to make all the time, for sure a gem hidden among great games and classic times ill never forget."
1118,10/10 crossbow op
1119,pure chaos and i love it

"
1128,Its really fun to play. Although official servers are no more but community servers are really amazing to play. Action here is really mind blowing (if more than 20 players join the server).
1129,Even through the years the game is still fun.
1130,fun - fun - fun

1132,"please REDUCE THE PRICE THIS GAME IS AWESOME

WE NEED MORE PLAYERS"
1133,revolver or melee no balls
1134,Just what you would expect :D
1135,"the game is amazing, half life 2 is a great game and this is just half life 2's gameplay but in a deathmatch mode, though the game is kinda dead."
1136,"fuck yeah
"
1137,its a very fun game for hl players
1138,this game is crazy i have 70 hours on another account and only 30 year old 14 year old steam account people play this and i often find myself questioning how come so many people play this game after 15 years but i realized it’s mostly weak garbage bots and they’re the only reason my kd is usually 102/5 so yeah this game is fire
1139,yes people are still playing this. yes it is still fun. i will headshot you with a magnum
1140,"It's fun, distracting, and no matter how long I play it, I never get better!"
1141,"
My brother plays this game, not me, I can't give a opinion on it, NA/10."
1142,yes
1143,great game!
1144,no
1145,"This game was my life in '06. Downloaded and made a Steam account just to play it. Many people might not agree, but I think it still holds up. Solid shooter to mess around with friends, and it's only $5.00. Or even cheaper if you buy the Valve bundle when it's on sale. Not much of a community anymore, but full servers aren't unheard of."
1146,"From the few rounds I played, I'd say it's pretty good.  But I'd rather play the campaign."
1147,"Recieved it for free when I got the orange box, pretty good multiplayer game."

1149,Very NIce!
1150,"I love when the tf2 community cries about not getting enough attention from valve when this game ""exists""

Needs some TLC"
1151,This game just wont die- At least one full lobby and a hand full of medium sized ones to this date
1152,love it
1153,"I mean, Half-Life?"
1154,"I love launching toilets at people who try to use the SMG at a range
"
1155,Still a classic. Am I not wrong?
1156,"Just like HLDS, filled with deadasses that uses aimbot.

No, dont buy it unless if you're going to have a pvp or something with a friend.

The graphics are nice.

Physics are nice too.

Idk man, never had a ''nostalgia'' connection with this game since i didnt knew it existed.

So, 7/10.

I dont know if i either should recommend it or if i shouldnt."
1157,"Um, I mean it's fine, I guess, but the lawlessness gets old. Servers are VAC protected, but don't seem to mind super disturbing verbal assault."
1158,"you have fun for a few minutes then get bored, its ok i guess"
1159,this game is super fun and i played for more than a hundred hours in it.
1160,its dead
1161,"It's less of a game and more Valve flexing that their physics prop code could be applied to a multiplayer setting. That said, it is a fun intense deathmatch game, and the physics objects add some interesting variations on standard shooter gameplay. If you have some friends handy and want to just jump into a game that pretty much everyone on steam probably owns, this isn't a bad pick. The reason you don't see more games like this is because neither Valve or anyone else can figure out how to keep players from jamming physics objects into moving doors or small corridors and creating broken or unbalanced defense points or just breaking the map."
1162,your a danm gucci
1163,Only good fps game
1164,"Murder with desks and the shitter, part 1."
1165,Aweosme game
1166,this game is no good the coding of the game is trash the jump makes you slow this game is 0/10 and they spawned me where the enemies are at this game is trash.

1168,"Tried for a few minutes, got back to CS again! Thanks for making this tho Valve!"
1169,"LOL, so easy game with easy enemies. i easy get 300 kills in full server by 40 mins"
1170,the best game to ever exist
1171,"Aged like a fine wine. Come on in, the water is... weird..."
1172,exciting game
1173,IT'S A GOOD GAME.
1174,"There's only 120 people playing this game at the time of writing, but it's not completely dead. There's an alive server every now and then, and it's a blast! Altough I feel that this game should be cheaper, even free because of it's age and playcount, but I think there's a bundle with Half-Life 2 and this game and some other Half-Lifes to get it cheaper.

The game is pretty old, and it's on the surface it's basically what it sounds like, but don't be fooled. Half-Life 2 gunplay, but very fast-paced and multiplayer. It's way more fun than it sounds! You can always use the good old SMG and Pistol, but the fun part is in finding random weapons scattered across a bunch of fun maps and using those, exploring every corner in the middle of a chaotic battle.

The shotgun is a great close-range and satisfying weapon, the Crossbow and Revolver are also very strong ""precise"" weapons, and the Pulse Rifle is a stronger SMG with a funny energy ball you can shoot. There's also an RPG, which can take out multiple guys in one shot but you can only have 3 missiles.

The most fun though is when you get to take out your Crowbar/Stunstick and bash powerless enemies in small rooms with it. The Crowbar is literally stronger than most weapons, if you know how to move around well. They shoot at you with their SMGs and Shotguns, but if they miss even one shot and you don't, they're dead. Crowbar OP.

You can also take out your Gravity Gun at any time and throw basically anything at your enemy. Be it a brick, or an explosive barrel. It's stronger than it sounds, and very fun.

All of this is in a very fast-paced deathmatch style, where everyone jumps around the map frantically with grenades almost everywhere. You may feel a bit discouraged to play if you're new, especially since most active players are long-time tryhards, but it's not hard if you play a bit. IMO, it's all in the movement, so if you're familiar with Source game movement, it should be good.

And remember, it's all for fun, there is no official competitive matchmaking or a level to keep track of!"
1175,lasagna
1176,Good old game...
1177,it's a good game
1178,its fun to see people get mad over this game
1179,Best game ever
1180,Cool concept. It definitively revolutionized deathmatch gameplay style. But it is not really fun to play to me. The game needs work to be better and could be better. Not giving out my idea for free though sorry valve you have enough money to pay me if you wanted to make it better. LOL :(  rating it a 1/10. Only giving a 1 for the concept.
1181,It's fun
1182,ncc
1183,its a good game but annoying and fustrating its not like other fps games you have to press 3 twice then click with left click to select the big rifle why cant i just press 3 twice why do i have to click that is so fustrating you have to be a good player because everyone will kill you there are only 10 australian servers they are all empty i have to play on other servers and i cant play good because i lag they are all high ping in the 200's
1184,"very pvp
much good"
1185,revolver + suit zoom = best weapon
1186,"Half-Life 2 Deathmatch is exactly what you'd expect. It's Half-Life 2, but the multiplayer component. And unsurprisingly, it plays exactly how you'd expect, too. It's really fun speeding around maps, headshotting enemies with your Magnum or sticking them to a wall with a crossbow... The best weapon is - hands-down - the rocket launcher. I think it's really fitting (but not at all surprising) to play as either the rebels or the Combine troopers in a fight to the death in some of Half-Life 2's iconic settings. But regrettably, there isn't much more to this game than that. Of course, it doesn't pretend to be anything it's not, as you'll be getting pretty much what you paid for. The sweetest thing about Half-Life 2 Deathmatch is that instead of being a standard shooting game, players can even mess around throwing random debris at their targets with the famous gravity gun!
The main reason I can't recommend this game is because it's simply outdated, and therefore, somewhat lacking. There are greener pastures; in this case, games like Team Fortress 2, Counter-Strike Global Offensive or even Left 4 Dead. And on the other hand, the lobbies are almost desolate. You'll still find some dedicated players here and there, but a lot of the games going on are bizarre mods or are filled with bots. This game can really only be considered play-worthy by proper Half-Life fans, such as myself. 
So the choice is up to you. At the end of the day it's good ol' Half-Life multiplayer in the Source engine - but I can assure you, unless you're playing this game in 2004, there's not much to see here."

Half Life 2 Deathmatch throws all the HL2 weapons and throws you in an amazing selection of maps to fight in.
This game is the lovely old deathmatch styled games. You either kill, or be killed! No hiding like games nowdays. You are the man, the badass, the ♥♥♥♥. Skill is everything, not some weapon you need to buy for 5 dollars.
Half Life 2 Deathmatch takes the badassness to the next level. You get to throw toilet bowls at each other with the gravity gun and get to time frags like a boss.
Sadly, the fans of deathmatches aren't as popular as the past. So recommend this piece of badassery to your friends.
10/10 Can shoot toilet bowls
"
1255,bad
1256,Pretty fun using all the HL2 assets for a DM game. Can get caught in a time vortex playing it for a decent amount of time.
1257,"Catch a grenade, throw it back!"
1258,This game is FUN!!! 10/10
1259,something about this game is just mind numbingly fun to hop on for 30 minutes to an hour and just play half life deathmatch. probably just nostalgic for me but i like community servers and the modifiers and tight community.
1260,its like you left a cum sock in a damp closet for 10 months it fucking grows into something incomprehensible by the human mind. I joined a server expecting to fight with like a smg or something but these motherfuckers found a way to use a aimbot to propkill what the fuck
1261,"[h1] DISCLAIMER: This is a first impressions review, and NOT a full review [/h1]

Half-Life 2 Deathmatch is a game developed and published by Valve

The game offers some nice graphics, although some ugly glitches here and there, it is pleasant all the same

Half-Life 2 Deathmath overall, however, is a fun game to play, and it does get boring if being played for a long time, but is a very good action game and to play in short bursts

[h1] RECOMMENDED :) [/h1]

1262,"I don't know why so much people hate this game. I like it. My favourite game mode is combine vs. resistance (team deathmatch). The movement feels great too. I needed to play the game at least for half an hour to get the feel of the game. 

For this low price, this game absolutely worth it. 10/10"

maybe that i just unlucky but i don't saw something interesting ¯\_(ツ)_/¯"
1277,the game just became laggy for me i dont know why
1278,"For what it is, it's a fun game. There's not much to it and it's supported by an extremely small, but dedicated, fanbase so you're more than likely not going to get into massive matches, but again it's fun for those that like multiplayer games."
1279,love the mods and game .
1280,I've loved this game for many years. It is an instant classic that is still played by thousands of people today and has been one of the more enjoyable FPS games still on the market today. It has a very pleasant player base and the servers are very unique amongst themselves. Give it a try!

1288,idk man this game is pretty cool bruh
1289,timeless classic
1290,"I love this game. It's quite fun, it is easy to play, it doesn't take much to run, and It is a classic. The only downside is that there are certain people who hack, cheat or exploit the game."
1291,"You can play with friends, that's deadmatch so cool. Half life 2 Deatmatch with half life graphics and players is so good. Very good game :D
"
1292,"For a small Deathmatch game for Half-Life 2, the community is one of the best I've played with."
1293,Still the most funny Deathmatch there is! I love all the strange weapons and stuff.

1296,"i love this game that you can be combine too . thanks for making this game :) i love all half life
but sad thats game not much popular :("
1297,good game
1298,"Probably the best game I have played in a while. The graphics are so realistic that I thought it was a real man running around a real-life area with a camera stuck to his head! The fight mechanics are so clean that every time I get a kill it feels so exhilarating!

10/10 would recommend as long as it is on sale."
1299,"Still just as fun as it was back in the day! In my opinion, the graphics stand up to any contemporary esports title. More hardcore FPS-fans will still find it challenging against experienced players :)"

GO GOD DAM ITTT AND BUY THIS AWSOME GAMEEEEEE!"
1304,"I would recommend bringing your friends also...This game is TOO underrated for a Valve multiplayer game, think about it, there are no Micro transactions, but there is no workshop at the same time, If you say this game used to be overrated at one point then something is wrong with you...

Pros-
Fun from time to time
No Loot boxes
play as rebels or combine
Get it before summer sale ends

Cons-
SUPER UNDERRATED!
People don't know what a good multiplayer game is anymore"
1305,"This was the game where I met most of my original STEAM friends all those years ago, alongside CS:S and DoD:S. One of the best online games with one of the best communities."

"
1308,"EDIT: If the fact that this game has more active players than GTA V dosn't tell you this game is good  well let me tell ya: This game has stood the test of time. <3

Original:
One of the best arena shooters there are.
Gravity gun with the source engines physics makes this great fun.
Get yourself some mates and have a go at this."

1311,This is just awsome!
1312,I liked how the game would give you the chance to play different types of mods.
1313,nicee!!
1314,"Classic DM, nothing more."
1315,"To be honest, Half-Life 2's weapons really aren't balanced for a particularly good deathmatch, and yet I've sunk hours into this game (Ignore the low hourcount, I played mostly before steam started tracking) becasue of the sheer variety of mods you find on servers. It's almost a sort of GMOD lite in that you never quite know what the map or gametype is going to be when you connect and it becomes sort of a cool hangout zone. Sometimes you get a co-op map or a werid obstacle course, or a wacky variety of characters and it's just fun to see what comes up.,"

1333,"everything was a nightmare!! I would get shot every 10 seconds, without even looking around. If you want the true multiplayer Half-Life 2 experience, it's called Garry's Mod (https://store.steampowered.com/app/4000/Garrys_Mod/)"
1334,good game
1335,gamer game gut new
1336,"[h1] Not all games from Valve are as good as they might seem at first glance[/h1]
Throughout their history, they have made several mistakes, releasing passing or poor-quality games. One of them is [b] Half-Life 2: Deathmatch [/b]. “But it's Half-Life,” the fans will say. So what ? The first sign was Half-Life: Source - a rather lazy and not needed remaster of the first Half-Life.
And with the release of [b] Half-Life 2 [/b], Deathmatch was added to this list.
So what is he like? In short, this is the same deathmatch, but with the number two and a gravity-gun in addition. Frankly, it’s already hard to forgive many things in HL2:Deathmatch that the first Deathmatch was forgiven due to the release date (1998 year after all). Judge for yourself - there are only 3 (!) unique maps made specifically for this game. All the rest are carefully transferred maps straight from Half-Life 2 with minor changes at best. For example, the dm_overwatch map was not changed from the word at all. Not only is it small for 32 players, it’s just simple spawn camping so common for this gamemode. It is very ""pleasant"" to receive a rocket from a grenade launcher at the time of spawn and understand that you can’t do anything in return. And so constantly during the match. Other maps are also badly made, because, suddenly, the idea of ​​transferring maps from the SP campaign even with minor changes is nonsense in terms of balance. In addition to the terrible maps in multiplayer, another problem is pop up - most weapons are simply objectively bad for killing against players. And this is not surprising - it was balanced to fight with AI enemies, and not people. Yes, there is a new weapon (a stunstick, S.L.A.M mines), but there is no sense on them.

In terms of servers (you cannot add bots offline), everything is pretty sad. Most of them are played by several players at best, all the rest are bots. Unfortunately, I didn’t come across a server with all the vanilla maps, so I cant say anything about other maps. Majority of servers are dm_lockdown \ overwatch \ runoff only, or custom ones, which are rarely any good at all.

There were no problems with the game on Win10.

[h1] tl;dr [/h1]
As a result, [b] Half-Life 2: Deathmatch [/b] is a very walk-through PvP game. There are only a few standard maps, and not all of them are played. The community of the game is small, mostly - veterans who have been playing this game for years. There are few newcomers, as well as servers with normal maps. Separately, taking the game makes no sense, as well as playing it. Its time is a long gone, however, like some other games from Valve (this is about you, [b] Counter-Strike: Source [/b])."
1337,i like it
1338,"Throw granade on the floor
Pick gravity gun
Pick granade up
Wait for beep beep beep

1357,fun game
1358,I like this. Gun go boom. 8/10.
1359,"More for the nostalgic players of Half-Life players I believe.

An older game with old graphics but with great physics.

Quite a big player base still with plenty of servers to play on with different game modes mainly DM but even some Role playing servers like Gmod.

Can be chaotic and fast paced and even frustrating at times.

I would recommend as a bundle or for a big fan of the HL series."
1360,I dont know if i recommend the game or if I dont. its counterpart Garry's Mod does Deathmatches better than this game. but I would like to think that any servers that are still up are filled with people who wanted to play. (im only recommending because I have to give a rating)
1361,This really all depends on if you have nice people on your server.
1362,"bot genocide is good for the soul
put on some music and its actually pretty damn fun, too"
1363,Fun servers but hard to find a game at times because so many servers are empty now a days.
1364,"If you like the combat of Half-Life 2 and just want to play PvP servers with less than 10 people, I recommend this game. Instead of RDM'ing on DarkRP servers in Garry's Mod, I play this because if you find the right people to play with, it can be a super fun game. It's great at doing what it does and I would definitely recommend this. The server idea where you can create and join other peoples' servers is a recurring theme, but it comes with so many possibilities, so I digress. If you want a fun game to mess around with and kill people; this is a great option because Garry's Mod is usually filled with so many rule-based games (RP) that this is so refreshing to play. Also, the cover-art of a player getting shot at whilst completing the ""flushed"" achievement from Half-Life 2 is the perfect description. Not only is there PvP, which is the main game mode, there are many other servers to play. However, the one flaw with this game thus far is it's old. Not many people play this game 24/7 and are only on at certain times, which is also a positive because it makes those moments of pure fun and chaos all the more tasty."
1365,grease
1366,"I love it! A great, fun minigame to play with friends."
1367,fuck this i cant even borrow it from by brother now it just says to purchase but its good still
1368,"I got bored and wandered around my library and decided to play this. It is really fun and it feels like a small,nice community"
1369,fun game very good clean fun!
1370,much more fun than cs go with less toxic players and less cheaters
1371,This game was awesome and crazy. It's so old though steam did not even keep track of playtime when it was out. The great source deathmatch games this gave spawn too. Cheers to the getto pc's we made just to play tf or dod.
1372,you might as well spend a couple hours on it dicking around with friends because i guarantee you got this game from the valve pack and just came here to see if it is worth playing.

1402,"This is by far my all time favorite multiplayer FPS. I clocked in hundreds of hours on a previous account as well. This was peak multiplayer gaming for me, and no other game has lived up to the experiences I had playing this. 

However, it is unfortunate that those days for this game have long passed... Most servers are dead. For me, most of my fondest memories come from playing with the same people on specific servers. I think it is the communities that I found in different servers that I miss the most, and what I haven't been able to find in any other modern game. With the servers now being mostly dead, it's hard to recommend this game to anyone now. I still open it up once in awhile to play it for nostalgia's sake, but there isn't any point in getting into this game now if you haven't already."

Graphics: 7/10 hl2 graphics but without the fancy episode 2 add-ons
Stability: 7/10 It runs as well as any other source game
Story: 7/10 this game takes place in the half life universe during the events around episode 1, an experimental combine drug was leaked into the breen water cans before the rebel uprising, it caused people to become extremely anarchist and bloodthirsty, the rebels you play as in this game are all a part of the rebellion that were drugged to shoot each other in small areas around the half life universe. Overall good story. 
Gameplay: 7/10 pretty fun
Music: 7/10 hl2 music

Overall: 7/10 they should have listened to the guy from the beginning of the game who told Gordon not to drink the water"

1446,noice i recom it
1447,"Good game, i would advise you get it if you enjoy Half-Life games"
1448,Don't buy this game. It's a waste of money. The servers are full of toxic idiots that get mad for zero reasons what so ever. It's awful and I regretted buying it in the 0.7 hours that I've played it. DO NOT BUY.
1449,it's nice
1450,I had a lot of fun in the one server that had people in it. There would be more people in the game if it came with half life 2 and you didnt have to pay 5 extra bucks for something that most people that own the game are the people who bought half life complete like myself. I've gone on the servers for half life 1 and they still have people on it that's becuase it came with the game and you didnt have to pay extra money to play multiplayer. Dont waste money on something that nobody else is playing go buy gmod people actually play and I'm sure you can find a deathmatch server out there
1451,"Overall, it's not bad but i do feel that there are better options for a general deathmatch experience, but if you are a fan of Half-Life then absolutely, do it.

PLUS: Not many people get the fact that THIS GAME IS INCLUDED FREE WITH ANY PURCHASE OF HALF-LIFE 2 EPISODE 1."
1452,Literally practice for PVP Sandbox in Garry's Mod
1453,"its not to expensife but its more funner then other more game!

i like it"
1454,good
1455,nice！
1456,It's ok
1457,sic gam
1458,"If you enjoy chaos, fun, russians, and 200+ FPS even with the weakest of computers, then you are at the right place."
1459,constant conflict get your frags here! get your fraaaaags here!
1460,mindless fun to shoot gmod admins in
1461,it like half life alex
1462,fun shooter. Good for all skill levels
1463,"Lots of fun being able to use gravity gun in multiplayer, lots of maps and great players. Check this game out if you haven't already!"
1464,"Play it, you Hoosier, you."
1465,my 1st steam game ever
1466,Everyone in this game is a dick head who is like 12 and dont understand how to not be a cunt
1467,fun time
1468,This game is surprisingly really fun. I would recommend it.
1469,fun
1470,pLAYED THIS FOR HOURS BROTHER
1471,"Old, but absolute PURE GOLD. 
You wont get a gaming community like this one! 
Though the game is old, who cares? Most people know Half Life but what could be better but playing in the world with some of the most interesting online players. Community is strong is Australia, USA and Europe. 
Though the game may go dead again sometimes, it always comes back with servers being filled up most nights with players across the globe."
1472,videogame
1473,"played it some, it's okay."
1474,The combine are not accurate to half Life. bad game.
1475,"Lets be honest here. Half Life 2: Deathmtach isn't good to today's standards. It doesn't work anymore.

If you join the game, your most likely gonna spend a good 10 seconds looking for a server with more than 1 person in it. but even if you do, its either a Russian server or another country server. I've had times where Lag can mess shots up, and it just feels like that HL2DM doesn't have the same feel as it did years ago. Its only gotten worse over time without the proper updates and moderation needed, yeah the VAC system exists but we dont know if its still being updated for games like HL2DM or other, because valve is focusing there VAC system on CSGO, which is understandable its a big game and all. but Half-Life 2: Deathmatch needs to have a dedicated Valve server to keep the game running without lag or etc."
1476,/
1477,SUCH AN AWESOME GAME !!   I recently got into this game as I am new to P.C. gaming and have only played half Life 2 on XboX~360 & XboX~one (many times over as it is one of the best games in the world) and since I just got a beefy P.C. I purchased the Half Life bundle and played this game first since I was very curious how a Half Life multiplayer game would be...  Well I am here to report that this game is just damn fun !!  it is straight to the point death match multiplayer that everyone can just jump into and start having fun.
1478,Classic game. Runs on a potato. Your friends have no excuse.
1479,"A fun, lighthearted mod for Half-Life 2 that doesn't take itself too seriously."
1480,good.
1481,yeah its ok
1482,je to dobra mp hra s prvky half life 2
1483,"Absolutely amazing game, it's a wonder this doesn't have a vibrant community to still support it"
1484,LOVE IT
1485,is good
1486,Gordan Freeman
1487,barely any players
1488,"very interesting game, i recommend to everyone"
1489,hi valve! I love this game but it got taken away! please i need help! i was told could have them can anybody help me please!?
1490,i thought this was some weird shitty half-life 2 spin off thingy but it pretty cool i guess
1491,10/10!
1492,"Very good! super fun! Not dead at all! One of if not the best half life game. All maps are good and tell a story through visual storytelling, like the overwatch commander voice or the blood and broken up door. Fun guns and dynamic gameplay alowing any physics prop to become weapon in multiplayer. Many custom modes maps models and much more! And it is the best part of half life, THE MUlTIPLAYER, Yea half life single player was always a side to the deathmatch, im not kidding its that good, but valve made a dumb mistake of focosing of half life really good but weakest part, UGH single player. Well at least you get coop maps."
1493,Still relevant
1494,Сначало было сложно потом начал привыкать
1495,this is the worst half life sequel
1496,this game is the ultimate online shooter
1497,Cool gane
1498,"Its still hella fun, but the scene of course got more competetive with only the core players remaining. This also means the gravity gun get used less, but you didnt use the tool in singleplayer combat either. Community maps and modes for this game are sparkling."
1499,Old but gold
1500,Best game ever!
1501,"legendary game, but old"
1502,"Still holds up, 15 years later."
1503,Do you like dying to Russian hackers?  Then step right up...
1504,This is just a pvp version of of Half Life 2 combat. Community is dead and anyone dedicated enough to play is probably a hacker or making a youtube video about it. It might be worth it to play with a bunch of friends but there are better games for that sort of thing. Still good because Half Life 2 is good.
1505,It's alright.
1506,Pure Win
1507,Meh....
1508,Just awesome with friends <3
1509,cant play anymore :(
1510,"Ah yes please, go grab the pulse rifle and then slaughter everyone in the server, then when I finally kill you, I will laugh and smile at your demise"
1511,the classic physics killbox game
1512,Great way to pass the time!
1513,nkmnkmnkbmnk mnkmnk mnkbmnk mnk mnk
1514,Still the best multiplayer game where you get to throw toilets at your friends to kill them.
1515,BRUH WHY CANT I PLAY IT WHY DO I HAVE TO PURCHASE IT TO PLAY
1516,"A decent game.
"
1517,i
1518,"golden game of the golden era, this game is what made fps great games, no cap on how good u can be, pros are excepctionally good, they are gods really, in modern times, only good players are playing, not so good for noobs, playable still, and very fun if u had played in the 2007-2009 years, you can quickly regain skill, game aimed for those FAST moving and fast aiming people, lots of mechanics, really the best fps i ever played, community is great."
1519,its ok
1520,Played it.Fun.but if you want to have the same taste as campaign half-life dont wast your money
1521,"Really good game, nothing bad to say, just half life 2 deathmatch!"
1522,much fun. wow
1523,Puzzle and coop is fun!
1524,"Best game ever ! Spent so much time on this game !
Would love to see HL3DM :)"
1525,yes pretty fun
1526,"It's a fairly uncomplicated run-and-gun game, lots of fun at LAN parties, etc."
1527,"man, back in the day I would spend hours on the puzzle servers. good times."
1528,"Most fun online shooter for me, hands down. Likely the only game in existence that lets you throw furniture in someone's face."
1529,TOP CLASIC GAME :)
1530,"Výborná hra pro ty kteří už dohráli Half-Life 1 i 2 a chtějí něco více multiplayerového. Je zde mnoho serverů ale moc lidí na nich není. Jestli chcete hrát tuto hru budete jí muset hrát s přáteli sám nenajdete nějaký server na kterém by bylo více lidí a normální ping.
Hra špatná není ale možná by to chtělo některé zbytečné servery odstranit protože na nich nikdo nehraje ale když hrajete se svými přáteli může to pro vás být perfektní hra. Hře dávám 7/10 a to z důvodu že většina serverů má obrovský ping a nikdo tam není také většinou potkáte lidi kteří to jen tryhardí a potom vás to donutí ragequitnout."
1531,"bitch
ass"
1532,Half-life 2: Deathmatch is great game to play with your friends and get to meet new player all over world to play with
1533,"y'all already know, this is Half-life for gods sake! play it!"
1534,Basically Half-Life Deathmatch Source but it's Half-Life 2 this time
1535,It's free and entertaining for a short period of time
1536,it's a lot of fun :D
1537,Best.
1538,Great fun with friends
1539,i like
1540,"This game is fun there are some mechanics that improves the game play
"
1541,it good game
1542,Great game
1543,"good game, i don't exactly play it often though"
1544,Very good game
1545,"Have you ever wanted to play Half-Life 2, but as a multiplayer team shooter instead? Well here it is. It's a different experience compared to Counter-Strike, since you've got your traditional Half-Life weapons instead, and you get to play with the Gravity Gun as a result. It's a fun experience, but there's nothing really here which hooked me. Half-Life 2 remains a singleplayer shooter in my heart, but it's nice to have the option to dick about in multiplayer as well.

*Obligatory toilet referance here*"
1546,one of my friends went afk so then i wanted to stop fighting my other friends so i can make a little base and take out the trash. also wish there were snarks
1547,ye
1548,"the normal game is better than it.
servers is awful , Game-play is horrible , Graphics as the normal game
Total points 4.5/10"

1553,pretty fun game to play during LAN party
1554,good game
1555,Amazing game :)
1556,one of the best deathmatch around !
1557,"Its an old FPS game almost as classic as Doom! People still create several new maps and mods even in 2020. The game still fun by all the phisic simulation it capeable. And a good to have hudreds of different severs active still these days! Don't be a Rito-ian rage kid (those sadly not even actual children) that only knows QWER buttons, aiming is not that hard! I would reccomend RTFS games as well, but this is not the review about them."
1558,nothing more satisfying than stuffing a radiator in someone's face.
1559,"Great maps, fun servers, hours of entertainment.   This game is old, but doesn't feel old.  decent graphics, configurable environments and fast game play...what's not to like."
1560,"Half-Life 2: Deathmatch is a gamers dream! If you ever wanted to simulate a never-ending battle between the Combine and the Rebellion, here is you game to do so. The source engine ensures that you get the Half-Life 2 experience you dreamed off and, in my opinion, if the combine and rebels fought like they do in this game, Half-Life 2 would have been waaaay more challenging.

Play this game, it deserves more attention."
1561,i hate fuck this game shit it is fucking awful i hate it so shittt do not buy!!!
1562,"Damn, what can I say about Half Life 2 Deathmatch? I will almost always enjoy the silly, stupid, fast-paced action of this game, even if it's pretty much the baseline, and has aged terribly, and no one's playing it."
1563,"Excellent game, even after all these years I keep coming back to it."
1564,i miss this game
1565,Best multiplayer game to exist in human history.
1566,HL1DM is wayyyyy better. Network code sux in this.
1567,I love to play this game in deathmatch
1568,ok

1584,heck. no gordon freeman but lots of fun
1585,"lllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllll
"
1586,"Some of the mods were great ,the hidden rooms not so much"
1587,"Really fun, gameplay is good, but deleting enemies with a radiator is the best."
1588,"In my ongoing and likely futile effort to write a Steam review for every game in my library (#276 out of 612)... it's time for Half Life 2: Deathmatch.

Half Life 2 is arguably the best single-player first person shooter of all time. This is the multiplayer component of that. Personally I'm not sure I really see the appeal, as much of what made Half Life 2 so compelling was inherent to its single-player nature. HL2 Deathmatch mostly functions as a multiplayer sandbox to play with the physics engine."
1589,It's a nice classic.
1590,good game to play on steam  have funn  you can donlode it on steam 10$
1591,"too many cheaters playing at ridiculous speeds - taking most of the frames so you don't stand a chance = Pointless playing - they have ruined a brilliant game!
"
1592,i cant dilate to this
1593,great
1594,"It's a classic. Funny and great fun. Shame that it is a bit un-loved by the devs. You have to connect to a LAN server through the console and it's not possible to change your skin from the default one. However none of that stops us from running round like crazies throwing fridges at each other.
"
1595,"Fast, very fast action, much better then tf2 actually, because there are not random crits in HL lol"
1596,This is one of my favorite valve games
1597,yummy
1598,i like it
1599,"Extremely hard to get kills if you don't play it that much, but even still, pretty fun to play."
1600,"This game is just wild. Even after all these years it still performs outstandingly. My laptop is literally a moldy rotten  potato and still runs this pretty decently. It bogs down on some custom maps and if there's a ton of bits and bodies flying around, to about 20 or so fps, but otherwise can still keep an amazing 60 fps despite it. Even with all the twitchy gunners that populate the servers still the only thing really holding you back should be your connection to your server. (And how much coke you did before hand.)

Recently I decided to switch to linux on my potato to test the waters and this is one of the games I wanted to try before hand. Overall it seems to perform better than before when I was running windows on the potato. Though most the Half-Life games are now supported natively it was nice to get a little test before I really decided to make the switch on other things.

So, if you're looking to shoot, blow up, or toss random things at your friends and family in a TDM style game and not really have to worry about hardware constraints this is the game you're looking for. Though be aware the player base is quite low anymore if you're looking to play just alone, but there's usually a few servers with quite a bit of people ready to duke it out with you."
1601,good game
1602,It is very good can be hard but good but it is a bit bloody.
1603,"game is fun
"
1604,nice
1605,i love the ragdoll efect on the dead guys
1606,"Simple game, take your time to learn the weapons and have some fun. Graphics are good enough even on a slow pc like mine, great reaction test ."
1607,it is a very fun multiplayer version of halflife 2
1608,gt
1609,:)
1610,would be incredibly fun if there were more than 2 players every 20 servers
1611,"Still a fun multiplayer fps, underrated"
1612,"[h1] Half-Life 2: Deathmatch [/h1] 

[b] Weird, Fun Multiplayer Mode For Half-Life 2 [/b] 

I thought this was going to be a dead game, or at least one with hackers and bots everywhere, but I was surprised to find a few somewhat populated deathmatch servers. Holy hell is this game crazy! I felt like a crackhead trying to nail every magnum snipe, shotgun blast, and baton wacking opportunity! This game is built like a classic arena FPS mode, except its using the engine from [b] Half-Life 2 [/b]. 

It is a little bit wonky, but it has its charm nearly two decades later! However, the number of players are limited, and the skill cap is very very high, so many new players will be turned away. I would [b] Recommend [/b] any hardcore arena FPS fan to give this game a shot. I don't know if I will put much more time into this game, but it was still a cool little shooter for the short time I played it!

[h2] Final Verdict: 6/10 (Above Average) [/h2]

1613,"I bought this thinking it wasnt going to be as good as HL1 multiplayer 
I was wrong Its gunplay is more solid and the action feels more fun and fluid.
I am putting this game in my top 5 multiplayer shooters of alltime."
1614,Awful
1615,"Fun, always wish there was more to it than same old deathmatch."
1616,"GAME BREAKER: Server side movement processing breaks the responsiveness of the gunplay. 

This can be close to non-extant, though if either the client or server side responsiveness or bandwidth starts to choke even a little bit, the game quickly becomes choppy and no one will be able to reliable hit anyone else. This becomes increasingly more likely as the player count rises above 8 or so. Also, major physics-affecting weapons such as explosion-inducing, often-spammed RPGs can cause the game to fully halt for a second.

In short, the complexity of Source Engine makes the game very tough for the server to run without choking. Allegedly the Orange Box engine modifications changed everything and killed the DM scene. I did enjoy the pre-OB engine in the HL2 demo.

RPG is very broken with multi-instakill potential. No other weapon can match its rate of elimination. Could be why almost no one is playing the game anymore. It's mostly bots playing now. Definitely not worth paying for this as it mostly just recycles the base HL2 assets.

Developer wiki quote about the movement processing by server:

""These time differences between server and client causes logical problems, becoming worse with increasing network latencies. In fast-paced action games, even a delay of a few milliseconds can cause a laggy gameplay feeling and make it hard to hit other players or interact with moving objects."""
1617,"Wonderful game, Just wish there is an in-game bot system that can also randomly select its own skins. I would also like to see more maps made for the game in the future."
1618,"i lve it

1619,fail
1620,honestly the best 1st person game ever.
1621,"Great game, I love it, it never gets old."

1623,fun

I wish this game have steam trading cards afyer they release hl alyx"
1625,"i have played a lot of hl2 games in the past, but this one is different from the others, you don't battle NPCs
you battle other players not NPCs it's also vary fun.

please tell my whats yall think as well.

goodbye! and have a safe and FANtastict day!"
1626,Truly a classic first person shooter.
1627,This is a great game for old school gamers. Good community of players who have never played Fortnite.
1628,this is my childhood so i had to buy it on my steam account
1629,Great People. OUTLAW's SERVER is the BEST. LIKE GOPHER's and FUSIONHEAD TOO!

1639,"If you love Half Life 2, you love this multiplayer mode too. You can fight with other players in PvP or play with them in Co-op, solving puzzles of course all in HL2 world."
1640,"If you are looking for PvP matches, this is the game for you. I do not recommend Garry's Mod PvP because you will risk getting banned by toxic admins for aimbotting. But here, the players here are chill and not much toxic stuffs happening in here."

1652,"[i]Half-Life 2: Deathmatch[/i] is an extremely superior sequel to the deathmatch of the previous title, although it isn't without its obvious issues.

There is a lot more freedom when it comes to variety of game types and the like that one can play in this incarnation when compared to what came before, and along with this version not being pretty much completely dead and barren besides a singular map, it really shows many more staying attributes than its predecessor. Although there are some hackers and the like out to ruin a good time, there are just as many great games with just dedicated players that want to enjoy this nostalgia trip instead, or experience for the first time decades later. The variety of weapons and better adaptation to more modern online multiplayer versus titles holds this together much better, causing a huge increase in overall enjoyment in comparison to the previous deathmatch, however, there are still some obvious issues with this dated experience.

Spawn points are easily one of the worst downfalls of playing this, as you will often be murdered by someone as soon as you spawn into the game, that or you will spawn right behind an enemy and earn a cheap kill because they have no idea you've just randomly respawned right there. Another problem that has more to do with modern enhancement rather than the quality is a lack of incentive boosters, such as unlocks, tracked levels and gained experience, and challenges to earn better rewards. Usually, you will only have standard deathmatch rules, that and some specific guidelines or handicaps depending on the lobby you are in. If these variety of maps didn't exist, many people would not be playing this release to this very day. Luckily, it doesn't find the same fate that the previous deathmatch did, and people are still having fun with it. Lag issues are something to watch out for, as even with a strong internet connection, I often found that some lobbies (either due to hackers or other player's connections) could lag extremely to the point that you can't play the game properly a majority of the time and often get slaughtered, and usually those who are cheating will make themselves invincible so that no matter how many times you shoot them, they never die, which can be a huge turn off when trying to play older multiplayer video games in general.

With all this being said, [i]Half-Life 2: Deathmatch[/i] is both a dated yet entertaining multiplayer experience that impresses just due to the fact of it being so playable almost two decades later, even with its shortcomings. This is the only deathmatch in the series one should play, as not only does the original pale in comparison, but the original is almost completely barren and on life support, so a [i]Half-Life[/i] fan may as well ignore it completely unless they hold some sort of curiosity and need to play it for themselves.

[b][RATING: 7.2/10][/b]"
1653,deathmatch is mostly a community of artist most of the places you play are made by some artist who also owns a server or that has downloaded a local artist free level for you guys to play which is expensive as all hell so you better appreciate it and by the way i can't draw for anything. but it is a great game.
1654,"Still has active servers, but for the price and todays standards you're better off getting Garry's Mod."
1655,Lol this game is dead
1656,HL2 is not so fun to play in deathmatch
1657,it was a fun experience
1658,GOAT

meet people from all over the world"
1660,"Very outdated just get Garry's mod or TF2 or Counter Strike instead,"
1661,"cock and balls

1676,fun
1677,great
1678,Although this game is old and not very popular now days. This game stands as one of the greatest childhood deathmatch communities. Unfortunately Half Life 2 Episode 3 never dropped and so the decline began.
1679,great game  and  great fun
1680,Wonderful game play. Half life but it's online and everyone is shooting at each other. Hones first person shooter skills better than any game I've played.
1681,"It's been my go to FPS game since 2007.  I play other modern FPS games, but I'll always come back to this game as long as the servers are up.  Shout out to Pirates cove and Fusionhead jazz club"
1682,everyone cheats
1683,"Kid's, this was our Garry's Mod back in the day."
1684,Always a pleasure to play this !
1685,super fun and easy to play
1686,Old but still amazing
1687,"Its a small game that runs on basically any computer nowadays.
Still active, can always find servers with players on it. The gravity gun makes for a great game mechanic.

Easily one of those games that you spin up for 15 minutes of fun and end up playing for several hours.

100% recommend, especially for the price."
1688,"my first time playing this i got a toilet to the face and told to eat shit, 10 years later i got told the same thing"
1689,oh yeah this game rocks!!!
1690,So.... I haven't played since 2016......It was fun back then
1691,May be old but still a blast.

1699,its annoying and no players
1700,"playerbase is still somewhat kicking, allowing for some good amount of fun to be had. from mild curiosity to massive amounts of fragging, gore, deaths, tears, and much [u] much[/u] more emotions to be felt."
1701,pure fun
1702,source engine deathmatch game
1703,please add a way to change fov in settings
1704,"If you ever want a game with friendly players and fast-paced gameplay, just go for this. This was the best game I have bought for myself. I always find myself coming back to this game, always the same server as well. I recommend playing on Pirate's Cove if you like to talk casually, and anywhere else if you wanna be a sweaty little pile of tryhard scum."
1705,its fun
1706,you shoot thing at dude
1707,i just played this for non-stop 3hours. It's fun!
1708,This is the pinacle of video games
1709,Very underrated
1710,"very fun 8/10, it gets really fun when your playing with 8 people and your just firing gun while jumping around, hitting barrels to blow up people next to it. I will come back for more so far these valve death match games have been awesome."
1711,Just starting to get the hang of it
1712,It takes tooo loong to load a match!!
1713,really catastrophic but still funnnn!!!

1725,funny
1726,epic
1727,its awesome!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
1728,Half-Life 2 DEATHMATCH is amazingly fun multiplayer experience its a great game to jump into when your bored although like many other old source games servers with many people are scarce
1729,"This game is quite underrated for what it is.
It's really fun to play even on servers where there's only 5 people (of course it's more fun and chaotic on servers with 12 people or more).
There's a pretty good amount of players playing this so you should be able to find a server which is quite alive at any time (mostly).
Try this game out if you haven't.
6/10"
1730,Its an unbalanced mess but it's fun
1731,"It is what it is, YOU are the shooter, others are playing  too, it's a blast   For over 15 years, it's a blast!  :o)"
1732,Yes!
1733,pretty fun
1734,Easy to plan and very entertaining
1735,i liek gaems
1736,Very confusing and there aren't that many people playing. There a definitely better source games to play Deathmatch in.
1737,yes good game i play this during my circumsicion

1756,Great game!

1758,i like    it.
1759,"fast paced fps for fun

but *definetly* wait for sale"
1760,"classic DM, what do you need to know.. grab a crowbar/gun/radiator/pissoir and get some kills!!!"
1761,"Game ain't dead yet suprisingly. I use to play PhoneBurnia back in the day this game had a lot more peeps. Most fun I ever had in this game. lot of trolling and dying, running away, basicly a zombie server. Since that server ain't on at all anymore. I just play the bouncy ball server which has been up for like 12 years. Just a zombie shooter and rank up server. pretty fun. It's good if you have a low end computer. some servers have people in in. litterly only 50 or less people are on this game since 2017 i noticed."
1762,Even though the player base is smaller than my pee pee and it's sometimes hard to find a server with many players it is still a good old-fashioned pick up and play shooter. good to screw around for like 20 minutes
1763,"Basically, it's shitty fun. Don't take anything seriously...just keep shooting. I do love it though."
1764,DECENT.
1765,God help! save me I'm stuck in hell mn
1766,"Good fish, it's good"
1767,"Half-Life 2: Deathmatch, as well as the entire Half-Life universe, will be forever a classic. Wish I knew more people that would play this game with me, but with all the new ones out there, yeah. Not that easy to compete."
1768,"DEAD. If you don't have friends then this game can be pretty boring, luckily I have a solution: http://rcbot.bots-united.com/"
1769,10/10
1770,This game is one of the funnest games ive played in a very long time! Also it uses elements from my favorite game! Half life 2! Definitely would recommend this amazing game if you love half life 2 and also love deathmatch games.
1771,"Though not as overwhelming as more modern games, it's a good play. Deathmatch sometimes mean you're playing against young have-nothing-else-to-do-in-their-life players so it's always a challenge."
1772,is meny cheters but is fun if you play whit friends

1802,Male_07 flings toilets at Male_04: The Game
1803,apart from the cheaters its good
1804,fun to play with bots
1805,"It's hard to find populated servers in Aus, which means quite a few matches devolve into a duel of gravity guns, b-hopping, and grenade launching. This turns into hilarious grief simulator for the opponent once you figure out grenade cooking & catching.  

That said; every once in a while when you join a server with a few players already on - this game and its mechanics absolutely shine through.  An excellent example of the old-school fast play FPS genre, with the added dimension of physics manipulation and fantastic maps. Controls are tight, weapons satisfying to use, and you wouldn't guess it's 15 years old. 

Grab it on sale cheap, and enjoy."
1806,"It's really fun throwing items at ppl with the gravity gun.

1807,thank you for an amazing 5+ years <3

1819,"Half-Life 2 Deathmatch, like Half-Life 1 Deathmatch, lacks content and players. However, the physics aspect of the game is still great. If you can overlook the problems with Half-Life 2 Deathmatch, then this is the game for you."
1820,FUCK YEAH
1821,"Dumb fun, that's all I can say, also I imported a very cursed spray."
1822,no
1823, мне очень нравиуа
1824,"This game is actually fantastic. It has some very unique and advanced movement techniques that are not seen in any other fps games. The gravity gun and how all the objects act in game is also pretty unique and works awesome. 

Not many people play this anymore but if you can find a game it is super fun and surprisingly well made for a free addon.
"
1825,fun
1826,most fun
1827,nice
1828,hurb
1829,10/10 Throw toilets at your friends!
1830,Still better than Call Of Duty
1831,Half Life 2 Muiltplayer is here
1832,"Based on Valve’s flagship Half-Life franchise, this little hidden gem of an add-on won’t actually require any pre-existing understanding of the series’ lore, although there is admittedly little chance of you coming across this in your Steam library without any prior experience with the exhilarating sci-fi adventures of Gordon Freeman and co.

In this purely multiplayer-focused experience, the player assumes control of either an unassuming Human Rebel or anonymous Combine Peacekeeper for a surprisingly fun time racing around ruined-industrial themed arenas taking potshots at your fellow player or AI bots with all the usual weaponry found in the base-game Half-Life 2. And forget the underwhelming gunplay in the main series’ two main instalments (there, I said it), because this is the first time the Half-Life arsenal as implemented in Valve’s Source Engine has really been given the chance to shine. 

Game runs well under practically any conditions, is up to Valve’s typical high standard. Looks good, sounds nice, controls and responds smoothly. Well worth a go, so you might as well install it and give HL2 Deathmatch a go, if enough new people do try it out, it might aid one of the game’s few flaws - it’s apparently so underground these days, that the servers could stand to pick up some new blood.

Recommended."
1833,would be good if people played
1834,"This is some good fun, especially if you start to destroy the server, throwing baths into peoples faces, launching nades, lot of good fun."
1835,"Some good old-fashioned deathmatch, but mine keeps jamming and tries to launch SteamVR.

Assuming it would work - it's probably best to play it after going through the singleplayer campaign (of Half-Life 2), then you can put your skills to the test. It's interesting to see the creativity of players using the gravity gun, although sadly it doesn't have much of a playerbase as it doesn't hold the same appeal as a game like Counter-Strike. Interestingly it got modded so much that it ended up looking like Garry's Mod with roleplay servers."
1836,just like the game
1837,"Wonderful game with low gravity, low friction and numerous custom maps and servers!  Many really cool people play this game...WHERE IS HL3?!!!!"
1838,"to me, this is awesome, especially the servers that have stuff cranked up all the way, which Pirates Cove is my favorite server...spawn killing is rough though, but this server is just to much fun to care"
1839,Good game for competition. FUN!!
1840,"Amazing!
Not enough servers though."
1841,Good game
1842,I LOVE THIS GAME. IM AN ACTIVE DEVELOPER. I PLAN TO REVIVE IT. AND BRING ITS BEAUTIFUL PEOPLE BACK
1843,"fun
"
1844,CoLDCommunity RP is the best server in this game
1845,*CLICK*Noice
1846,git gud
1847,"Bruh. No.

The servers have all but vanished and people just don't play it, because there are more better and active Valve MP games. Simple as that. Gmod Textures? Yeah, sure, but that's about it for me."
1848,it gud
1849,Very Fun
1850,Smack a fine gentleman with a toilet
1851,"
IT   SUCK"
1852,"I played this game for long hours on this and other accounts and been in love with long ago. It's one of the most amazing multiplayer games I've ever played.

Now that I'm coming back to play it, I find it confusing that the game still has a price tag on it. Shouldn't be free to play by now? (just like TF2) I would play it me and my friends a lot and im very sure many other gamers would as well if it was free to play."
1853,Great childhood game. sad to see it quite empty.
1854,Your life is not complete if you haven't killed someone with a toilet.
1855,"bunch of boomers but it fun
"
1856,"Excelente Juego, muy recomendable para maquinas de baja potencia!"
1857,"Great Game! I think this game has so many great things about it, but my only complaint is lag ( but this could just be the server I was playing on or my internet )"
1858,like snorting instant coffee in FPS form (in a good way)
1859,"I have my personal history with half life , when i was young i was spanish champion in deathmatch tournaments , hl1 and hl2 , so for me is the best videogame ever made!"
1860,It's a Pretty Good Multiplayer Game!
1861,The only game I can think of besides pirated CS 1.6 and Source servers where all the servers that are joinable are exclusively full of Russians.
1862,g
1863,The best ever Multiplayer Deathmatch game from VALVe ever!
1864,Just get this!!!
1865,"Bunny hop, gravity gun, reliable player base. What else would you want from a game? Time flies by."
1866,игра нормальная стоит ли того если честно незнаю игра всего на пару вечеров и все а так игра быстро наскучивает
1867,This Game is still good and i like it due to it have a lot of replay value
1868,This game fucking rocks!!
1869,"Step 1. Get friends
Step 2. Buy this game
Step 3. Have unlimited amount of fun!"
1870,"there is no limit for this game, 
you can aim while flying, you can play as you imagine"
1871,"Chaos Incarnate! Just as fun as when i was 15, more people need to play this game!"
1872,u can launch melons into your foes and kill them
1873,Very Good With Friends :)
1874,"Oh Hell-Yes!!  Been playing HL2 DM since it was 1st released.  It's a c*nt of a game, go deep and enjoy."
1875,it be a guud game
1876,"There are to many things I like about this game so I will just mention the bad as I am sure everyone will already know the positive, because I LOVE THIS GAME!

Finding servers that are the right match for you can be really hard sometimes, especially for me as I am not a fan of competitive shooters except this one of course. it is now getting harder and harder to find populated servers too as when I played yesterday there was only a single page of servers! which is a shame but its the hard truth as online games age there are less and less players around. hackers can be found on non vac secured servers which basically mean you cant play as mostly consist of cheaters which are no fun. 

I have so many good memories with this game way before me and bro bought our copy, playing it at a friends house for hours and hours over lan and internet!. HIGHLY RECOMMEND, always coming back for another game every once and a while!"
1877,"A riveting classic. Mental, brilliant!!"
1878,Pretty Decent!
1879,great
1880,Love it!
1881,HL2 Deathmatch does not get old!  Many mod variations available and a good SDK for you to build maps or make a variation of the game yourself.  I've been playing HL2 Deathmatch for about 15 years.  Great people online to play with and it's always a good time!
1882,A classic among classics! If you've never ran thru the trenches or hidden behind the walls of HL2: DM then you can't say your history of gaming is complete! From the many variables to choose from its your trigger happy finger and your quick wits that'll keep you alive in this world! HL2: DM is a must have for every 1st Person gamer.
1883,yes just yes
1884,mouse1
1885,Its ok not great
1886,yes
1887,BIG SAD NO ONE PLAYS THIS GAME

Check out the video here:
https://youtu.be/MHBc3ERxV0Y"
1894,games fun but dead
1895,A good oldschool fashion game where players can bhop alot & make tons of frags through 2004 - 2014! The bugs should of been fixed by now which is the gravity gun sounds & the crossbow!
1896,This is a excellent first person shooter.  I’ve been playing this for 10+ years now & it doesn’t get old.  Can’t beat the price either: $5.00.  ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️
1897,"one of the most overlooked games in valve's repertoire. while not nearly as popular as it was in 2005, the game is still alive nonetheless, with a few hundred people playing at a time. incredibly fun, with fast-paced gameplay baring much resemblance to unreal tournament."
1898,this was a really fun game to play with a few people
1899,yes
1900,You can kill someone with a toilet
1901,its a good game but its sad that it doesnt have much players anymore
1902,"This game was made by Valve who also operate Steam, which is unarguably the worst online video game distribution platform in the market."
1903,Dead game... it happen

Guy keeps dominating me
finally kill him
my life is contempt, i can finally rest

Leave the game
Go to bed

1911,HL2 but you throw toilets at your friends
1912,"really good arena shooter. Especially the pirate cove servers. Everything but the auto firing guns are 1 shots. For the base game, it's still god but i really hate the explosives and the gravity gun. But as long as pirate cove stands ima be a monster on those games. Really fun."
1913,"It's pretty fun, but there aren't that many good servers for the game as of now."
1914,This game is boring. Do not waste your time.
1915,this game is epic
1916,Robert sugi pula
1917,i miss all the cool servers where people would scream at me
1918,Sadly no server near me.
1919,"HL2DM is a very good game. It's fun and takes a lot of skill unlike others. A very big personal disadvantage that this game has is the insane learning curve. A beginner like me would get seriously fcked, and here is why. Where should I begin, the game has a small community now. There are like 300 people at best playing this game. 80% of them are dinosaurs who've been playing this game from the very start. And this game is 15. They have several thousands of hours of playtime, and they've mastered literally everything and know each cm of map. So if you are a beginner, catching up will be very difficult. Other than that, it's great."
1920,"Valve, make it free!"
1921,Love it!
1922,"I am truly amazed at how good Half-life 2: Deathmatch is. Unfortunately, the servers are not very populated at this point. However, i would prefer this game over CS:GO any day.

10/10."
1923,oof
1924,good
1925,"Deathmatch is more then Deathmatch games or team stuff it become into a gmod lite, it had many server with many game modes, like zombie just spawning and you going around just shooting, or RP were cop and citizen mess around, it was a good time, i miss tho days"
1926,good game however though the community is dead
1927,0/10

Try to learn nade-throwing with physcannon and good jump techniques beside your aim, than you have a lot of fun"
1931,"I am a veteran and played 52,134 hours of this game, very good"
1932,"i came back to see this so uh

This game is really good
only problem?

Team Deathmatch gets confusing when rebels names are in red."
1933,I swear the point of this game is to kill people with toilets.

1936,its alright
1937,its ok
1938,"Back in the day it was so nice, it's hard to come across anyone that's english nowadays."
1939,My buddy and I shot barrels at each other for an hour and half. Awesome fucking game.
1940,add grifball
1941,Nyaaa~~
1942,"Unlike all the other old valve multiplayer only games all the servers a dead. I cant recommend this one, sorry."
1943,"Completely empty, but still a fun experience.
Valve make Half-Life 3: Deathmatch already"
1944,"sadly multiplayer is almost dead.
but at it's prime the game was awesome"
1945,It's like cod team deathmatch except with half life 2 mechanics. Barely anybody plays so good luck finding a decent server.

1947,Can't say I played much of this.  You're betting off just playing the Half-Life 2 single player.
1948,its half life... of course its good
1949,"this game is still playable
im so happy"
1950,Lost every match until now. Not so fast and reactive as 14 years ago. 12/10 would recommend.
1951,"It's a mess. Server download times are like 15 minutes and it's not worth the wait. Full of angry russian kids. Maps suck. Everyone has huge health points, which makes it get dull real fast.


2/10"
1952,"I love this game. I grew up with it, and it's still my most favorite deathmatch game of all time. Really solid gameplay, satisfying physics, and really fun firefights. It's very well perfect. Sad that it's not as active as it used to be, but there are still players, like me."
1953,Wish you could create servers with bots. That way you don't have to join some random server with 2 other people that plays earrape mario death sounds everytime someone dies. At least it comes for free with Half-life 2: episode one.
1954,its aight
1955,thumbs up
1956,Valve please add multiplayer to this game.
1957,"its cheap and funny expecially if youre playin with friends
"
1958,"Updated review (25/2/2020)

The Game is rly fun,its community isnt rly Big but there are ppl still playing It

Another good thing of this is that you dont need to pay this Game,It comes with half Life 2"
1959,very fun to play in LAN
1960,peepeepoopoo flying toilet heehee
1961,"MET A MAN NAMED KOOLAID THAT DID A JOB OF RESIZING MY ASSHOLE, OTHER THEN THAT REALLY GOOD GAME"
1962,"In addition to having very few servers with more than five people playing at a time, you will spend 90% of your time downloading custom server files, and the rest of the time realizing that the servers you join, even though advertised as deathmatch, are playing some indescribable and unplayable version thereof in awful maps. This was a complete waste for something that could have been a lot of fun and provided countless hours of gameplay. If there was ever an actual game here, it has been long dead."
1963,good game but not so many player come often
1964,it fun but sometimes people dont exist
1965,okay
1966,Best game ever everyone should play at least 3000 hrs of this
1967,Good old times...^^
1968,Extremely fun game with friends
1969,Even More Fucking Chaotic. I Love It!
1970,The usual deathmatch servers are mostly empty but if you find a match with some players it can actually be pretty fun if you're in the mood for some deathmatch.
1971,"Legitimately fun and refreshing game to play for an hour or so now and then, assuming you can find a good server to play on."
1972,The addition of physics makes this game so special. My favorite is when a battle turns into an all out toilet chucking war.
1973,Really nice game!! Love it!
1974,roblox !!!
1975,"ONE of my CHILDHOOD GAMES
AMAZING"
1976,All physics kills use a toilet icon. Best game ever.
1977,"2 friends. 100+ hours. Half-Life 2 Deathmatch on a dedicated server.

I have no regrets.

1978,Pew pew
1979,nice

1989,This game is a gem. Mods keep it interesting.
1990,Dont forget to pick up new album kamikaze
1991,VERY GOOD
1992,really fun and wacky fps
1993,The game is fun
1994,it's ok i guess
1995,Nike
1996,Great game..
1997,"Unimaginably fun at LAN parties. If you want to kill time with friends, this is a great choice."
1998,"I used to play this all the time when I was younger on an old account I can't access anymore

The game is still going, but you're hard-pressed to find any vanilla Lockdown 24/7 servers anymore

Still a great game, catching an opponent's grenade with the Gravity Gun sending it right back at em is one of the most satisfying skills in any game to pull off"
1999,yeah ok buddy
2000,Half Life 2 Deathmatch is a lackluster mod for Half Life 2 that's just a normal deathmatch Game with Half Life 2 weapons and small maps but For 0.49$ It will last you a while but the normal price of 5.00$ it is not a great price for a Half Life 2 mod.    On sale you should probably pick it up but without the discount no
2001,Pretty cool
2002,"great game my favourite

best game"
2003,Hype ass game Hype ass graphics Hype as people No pussy poeple and no Scipt kiddies just guys who know how to have some good fuhn
2004,Over a decade ago I got this game for having purchased a GPU (both ATI and Nvidia customers could receive HL2DM). Probably one of the most solid basic deathmatch games available.
2005,Pretty good stuff right here. Old but still has players so it stands the test of time n all that.
2006,boneless Gmod
2007,nice!!
2008,best game circa 2010
2009,You should Play Half-Life 2: Deathmatch for co-op servers. These are always so much fun to play with friends.
2010,its fun
2011,"Good game to play with friends, good for assets to use for Garry's Mod as well."
2012,"I felt my previous review was uninformative, so I have revised it.

Hit registration and weapon balance suck. Headshots deal three times more damage. AR2 Orbs instantly kill players AND track them.
There are also many hi-kill servers with instant-kill weapons that may mislead newcomers to think that is representative of the game. Admittedly, those servers are a majority of North American servers. But for those who seek a competitive thrill, this game has a movement mechanic similar to quake. You can gain speed more easily, but your top speed is slower than quake. I prefer this movement because it gives it some usage during combat. 
One major tip that I have for newcomers is for you to join the official steam group chat for this game. People are willing to help if you ask for it.
A good video to learn Circle Jumping can be found by searching ""HL2DM Movement Ontivero""."
2013,awesome game it is cool
2014,Classic and timeless. Great gunplay and the physics models makes the action funny as well.
2015,rtygfdsgfds
2016,nice game
2017,"Game has given me over 10 years of love. Done almost everything there is to do in this game as far as pub play, competitive play, built and played mods such as capture the flag, pro mod, gungame mods, ran servers, installed server mods and plugins, created maps and more. There is so much this game has to offer, it is sad that the developers never gave it the time of day, but even without the support it still found a way to many peoples hearts."
2018,"Join the second coming

SaltierSquad's Deathmatch! Come join us!
162.248.92.39:27015"
2019,Good fun with friends
2020,"Fun, but it would probably be even more fun with friends."
2021,"Crazy fun and extremly funny with friends!
You'd be suprised that there are a few players playing and quite a few active servers!
Really recommend to get it with a friend, espcially at a sale when it costs less than a dollar!"
2022,"[b] Even for todays standards a unique multiplayer hit with stunning physics and special gameplay. A well designed fast deathmatch shooter. [/b]


+ stunning physics
+ graviton let every object become a projectile and stirs up the classic weapon arsenal

2023,"Servers are kinda dead which sucks, but a fun game to mess around with your friends in."
2024,Too bad it doesn't have much players playing anymore.
2025,hvh?
2026,its aaaaight
2027,"Played some matches, it's fun."
2028,lol it's fun
2029,Cool
2030,It's fast paced it's fun and it doesn't require a killer PC to run.
2031,"This is what you'd expect from a Half Life deathmatch game, but better because it's in the Source engine, instead of the Quake engine, like what I'm used to when it comes to deathmatch (mainly Quake 3 Arena). Some portions of the maps reminds me of areas from Half Life 2, like this one map with this building, that has RPG rockets, that reminds me a lot of that part from Half Life 2 where you have to kill the snipers for Barney."
2032,great deathmatch game
2033,js_
2034,"The game brings me back from my old days of playing half life, I have fun playing this game but it is glitchy beside can't choose your player model, their is a strong small community in the game and I am proud of that community."
2035,"Ah Half-Life 2...

I remember back when I was a kid that me and my group of friends would play either this or Source Deathmatch if ever we got together to play. While I don't think the original Deathmatch can let you play against bots if you wanted to go solo or your friends just can't play with you, HL2's Deathmatch at least let's you have that option if you took time to look up how to play against bots on your own.

On its own it is an undoubtedly very old game with a very old way of playing it (getting your friends together to play) and while I personally don't think it holds up in comparison to most games that have a similar style of gameplay (Team Fortress 2 is one such example), I believe it's an okay game if you have some spare time to go back to classic deathmatch games, whether playing against your friends or against bots if you wanted to do it solo. I wouldn't recommend this game unless you are one of those people with a group of friends looking for all sorts of multiplayer games to do together."
2036,It's fun
2037,"Jogo é engraçado e muito bom, half life é half life, uma pena que tem pouca gente atualmente jogando"
2038,SaltierSquad Deathmatch
2039,Still fun after all these years
2040,"Its still alive! This combined with singleplayer Half Life 2 are the games responsible for turning me into a full time pc gamer. While class mates were going on and on about cod on console, i was busy shooting toilets at peoples heads. I think i picked more wisely. (plus cod 4 wasnt that hard to run on pc and was better on it anyways but elitism aside...)

This is a steal for 62 cents cad (summer sale 2019) come join us!"
2041,"
Another one of Valve's games they left to unfortunately die."
2042,"How is this my most played game?!

it must be good then"
2043,RELEASE HALF-LIFE 3
2044,"Good game, nice graphics easy to play"
2045,Where is Gordon Freeman?
2046,"Help there's a man in my house he has a gun please SOMEONE CALL THE POLICE THIS ISN'T A JOKE HE'S TAKEN MY DOG HOSTAGE 
7/10
"
2047,Really a lot of fun for how old it is.
2048,"Death by flying toilet!

PROS: The superb controls of Half-Life 2 are brought over into the game.  The sounds of all the weapons still have that kick to them, especially the gravity gun.  The maps are designed for much smaller, tighter, and thrill based combat compared to the original.

CONS: It is just another deathmatch game, once again lacking some of the further refinements brought out in other Source based games, and especially those that have been continually updated and supported.

FINAL: The game is fun, and has it's shining moments when everyone is using the gravity gun.  The uniqueness of the gravity gun aside, it is a solid little distraction, but has little to offer in the long run.  Take a look if you'd like to see, if only to defeat an opponent with a flying toilet."
2049,"Again, it's a deathmatch game based off half-life 2.  This game use to be a lot of fun many years ago during all the hype, but has fizzled in recent years in my opinion.  I recommend this game, but don't expect anything to fantastic anymore.  If you play, have fun, good luck, and have a fantastic day!"
2050,amazing experience to have when bored.
2051,"Well what can you say.

It's a deathmatch version of Half Life 2

It's ok"
2052,fun game but dead which suckksss
2053,it be good

2060,"It's fun for a round or two, but that's it... The servers are also very lonely."
2061,"Play half life 2 with your friends and fight to the death!
"
2062,"At the time of this review, this game is 15 years old.. I got it along with CSS and DODS, and never really touched it. It is still very much alive and very very fun. The satisfaction of killing someone with a toilet, or having them die from an explosive barrel after you die is immense, and the HL2 weapons fit well in a multiplayer environment. I'm glad I decided to go back to this game and see what I missed (or didn't miss, since the game is still very active)"
2063,Even better?
2064,history
2065,":D
"
2066,No.  Just don't.  It's only fun if you have friends that play it because nobody does play it.
2067,"What a fucking game.

This game has such a special place in my heart. This was my first multiplayer shooter of all time. The memories I made while playing this make me feel like I've been alive for a thousand years."
2068,GOD TIER GAME. BETTER THAN ANY OTHER TEAM FIGHTING GAME ON THE INTERNET.
2069,fun
2070,"i have to play on another account because im vac banned but i never feel like playing it..

most of the servers are just low gravity and the shot gun can kill someone across the map with one hit. the weapon selection just feels stale after a few hours. i wouldent suggest playing in 2020."

2103,"This game is great, dumb fun! And that's all you can ask for in a DM. Don't let my playtime fool you, I have been playing this game monthly since 2005. The player count has shrunk considerably over the years but there's still some solid servers with enough people to make the matches as exciting as they ever were. This game is a time capsule of an era when online deathmatch games were like the wild west and driven almost exclusively by the community."
2104,"it's a damn shame so few people play this anymore, it's really really fun."
2105,"very  good tbvh worth the £4
"
2106,"Very Fast Paced Shooter!

I used to play this game back in 2012 ish or 2014ish but there was a server I spend at least 50 hr on, It had a wonderful community and all that..the game is still semi active during the time of this review..I love it."
2107,"Gr8 game m8, but it's lowkey dead. It's fun af.

2108,This game was my Halo 3 (as in I pissed away all of 2008 on it)
2109,"I like this game,not much players left..."
2110,i enjoyed this a lot with my vostro 1500
2111,I got this game over 11 years ago as a free game for registering steam with my Dark Messiah Might and Magic purchase and this free game ended up being better than DM! I can finally play this game appropiately at 1080p 144fps i'm still not great at it but it's fun none the less!

2122,wicked fun game good times.
2123,greatest game of all time

2125,really funny
2126,not that great
2127,"This game is dead. It was great 10 years ago, but now is dead. It was bright and shiny, full of skill like Quake...

2128,"This Half Life game (which i played long ago so i don't remember much, don't judge me if it has changed) has a pretty good community with a lot of servers with custom maps and weapons which made it really fun"
2129,This game is so fun and funny
2130,F.U.N !
2131,"Mortal Kombat Scorpion, Thumbs Up!!"

Unlike modern Live Service Online Games that depend only on one server."
2133,demo of gmod
2134,"Come enjoy the final days of this classic old school shooter.

Simple, honest and frustrating. 

Great game."
2135,this gaem is stupid
2136,Classic.
2137,"lots of old people play this game and they get mad when you kill them.......Joking aside if you can get some friends together this is a Great game that has aged well.  Because this game is lacking players and finding a good server is hard, even Day of Defeat (another forgotten Valve game, Plz Gaben for DOD-GO) has more players than this.  But i can still recommend this if you have friends and want a hour or 2 to waste."
2138,"This is a really good game. It gives you the basic understandings of shooters, such as teamwork, checking corners, and suppressing known enemy positions. I would definitely recommend this to a group of people who want to develop their communication skills with callouts and timings with pushes and other tactics."
2139,Surprisingly good
2140,"ever since i started playing hl2 i've always wanted a game like this. it's exactly what you'd expect, but 1000x better. i would honestly recommend this game to literally anyone who has played any fps game in the past. it's pretty fuCKIN amazing honestly! besides it's only 5 bucks just get it-"

2155,GOOD GAME BUT ALL PRO IS BULLY ME :(
2156,"I got this game by using a link that would give it to you for free that no longer works.

The skill ceiling in this game is unbelievable. Add in all the easy vanilla Source stuff like crouchjump, bhop, etc, and mix in total nerdout stuff like grenade cooking and magnum 2-taps. If you go on a higher skill level server be ready to have your ass handled to you by some guy shooting props and thowing perfectly timed nades at you while scoring 50-2 (sadly, not because he's cheating).

The weapons are a joke. What works well in a singleplayer game surprisingly does not translate into good online gunplay. Automatics are useless, shotgun is surprisingly underpowered, crossbow is nearly useless, and magnum rules over all. I do quite well in CS and TF2, and FPS skills I got there are not of much help.

The game support is also a sad situation. dm_runoff out of bound exploits that worked eight years ago still work fine. Anti-$ignorez measures can also be bypassed in a matter of minutes without cheats as they had been six years ago. I'm still glad however to see at least 300 people playing it on average.

The server situation is a mixed bag, You have your normal team deathmatch pubs that are actually okay, co-op servers that lag like hell since they are all located in Europe/Russia, roleplay servers, the existence of which puzzles me because gmod is far better suited for roleplay, and community free-for-alls which are ruled by the type of people who have to apologize for handing you your ass too hard.

I would reccomend getting this game only if:
* You have a time machine and can go back to the days when this game had used to be free
* Bought a Valve/HL pack and got this as a part of the deal
* Enjoy games so hard that they make Quake look like checkers

I'm not recommending this game not because it's bad or because the learning curve is steep - I'm not recommending it because there's no learning curve, but rather a brick wall that you hit."
2157,amazing game played years ago just re descovered and its amazing
2158,it is a yeet of a time
2159,Good game
2160,"i played it and didnt like it. 
nuh no nice.
1/10 stars.
bad game
















































































































lol just kidding it was epic you all got juked for 3 days lol hardy har har"
2161,😍
2162,not bad
2163,"A very laggy game,when i was playing with one of my friends,the server kept changing every 5 fucking seconds,and i dont believe that this game will get anymore updates since VALVe dont want to wake up from their money bed,i dont recommend this game."
2164,Good to see Half life Multiplayer more fun story is great now multiplayer good job Valve
2165,Its dead but so fun
2166,Classic.
2167,Game literally has 5 - 6 players and it's almost dead. Players get instant kills while being able to run around at moch 10000 speed and can shoot @ you while looking forwards. It's a waste of time and computer space.
2168,Best game of all time...
2169,i like shooting people
2170,10/10. Even in 2018
2171,"Similar to Half LIfe's multiplayer Deathmatch but set in Half Life 2. The gravity gun makes a great weapon to use on foes :)

"
2172,half life is great
2173,"[b]RIP HL2:DM[/b]

What was once a crowbar slinging, barrel flinging, melon fest is now a low-tick no-bunny-hop excersise in futility. Far surpassed in creativity by the likes of Gary's Mod, Minecraft and other, actually developed, properties, Half-Life 2: Deathmach has seen better days. Of course if you want to smash someone with a gravity gun there still isn't a more satisfying option. (Thanks Valve)"
2174,"The game may be seriously dead, but the few servers still active keep it alive enough to play it. Buy it on sale to get the most out of your purchase, because I don't think 5$ is worth a few hours of a FPS game relying on online play that might even have enough players to host a full lobby. On sale it can be as cheap as a dollar.
"
2175,"Half-Life 2: Deathmatch.. it's a really fun game to be honest.
My first server i joined was some sort of a coop server. I managed to meet some nice people there. Maps were really interesting and creative and overall, i can recommend HL2DM just because its on Source, and, a lot of things are possible in it. You just need to know how to do them. I really recommend the game itself as well. I bet it would have been even better if i brought my friends."
2176,3/10
2177,AWEsome!
2178,"Hello, it's 2018...Why is this game still so good????"
2179,i wish i could go back to the old days...it used to be so much damn fun
2180,old but gold.
2181,great game #longlivehalflife2deathmatch
2182,Probably the best multiplayer game I have ever played
2183,no
2184,asd
2185,"One of the most underrated games in history 
10/10"
2186,good game
2187,"Not the best game, in my opinion. Doesn't have much things to do rather just shooting with couple of same guns. Not many players out there either..."
2188,"The game may be seriously dead, but the servers that are still on it keep it alive in my book."
2189,"Can be a lot of fun to just shoot up big teams of bots. Unfortunately, the online community isn’t as vibrant now as it once was, so often times it’s hard to find a match with lots of people playing in it at once. Nice maps. Still fun."
2190,"Definitely in an odd spot between modern FPSs and classical shooters. Not much in the way of strategic thinking, so don't come in here thinking anything beyond Run. Shoot. Don't die. Definitely an exellent time waster, though there usually aren't many players and most of the servers are dark RP or something like that."
2191,"m,de encantooo111!!!!"
2192,it is ok I guess
2193,old days I wish I could go back in time.
2194,What the fuck even is this?
2195,"[h1] Retro Review[/h1] 
When i got this game back when it released i mostly only played modded servers, especially roleplay real life servers were my kind of thing. I always felt that the weapons the game offers are fun but not quite balanced for multiplayer.

[u] Gameplay[/u] 
To be honest there is not much to tell. As a multiplayer casual shooter it can be fun at times but the thing is that some weapons arent balanced really well. Most servers have either  some things disabled like the rocket launcher or the maps are free for all or casual deathmatch mess where half of the players are afk or barely playing.

There is a lot of players still there, steamcharts even says the average is almost 200 hundred playing. But the question is really why should you bother with this when there is garry´s mod out there that literally improves on most things i said and have better modded servers and a higher player count.

[u]Aesthetics [/u] 
Most of the maps are inspired by or directly taken out of the base game and have been altered slowly to be more like an arena map. In itself that isnt bad but there not even 10 maps and all of them are more or less small and not really that fitting in a game like this. They arent really designed in a way to enhance the gameplay of half-life.

[u]Conclusion/TL;DR [/u] 
When there is a better alternative on the market there is no point staying here and wasting your time. Garrys Mod doesnt have most of the issues like the boring maps or unbalanced gunplay. Move on if you really want a multiplayer shooter that has the gunplay of half life, or even more. "
2196,güzel
2197,"Great game, can play it for hundreds of hours and never get tired of it :)"
2198,"First time playing this game.

2203,"Just a Deathmatch Garrys Mod for Half-Life 2 Owners. TOSS A TOILET AT YOUR BUDS TODAY!

2204,Some weapons do feel a bit unbalanced but it is fun under the right situations. Definatly worth a try considering the price.

2230,Make HL2 Deathmatch Great Again
2231,has a good e-sports community
2232,"This might just be an afterthought for Half-Life 2, but it's a hell of a lot of fun when you get the right friends together."
2233,best games are on deadbox maps
2234,"Best FPS ever, in my heart forever"
2235,Way too generic and nothing like the original.
2236,"A great classic multi-player shooting game.  I just started playing it recently for the first time so I'm not that great yet, but it's loads of fun!"
2237,"I prefer Gmod
The servers are empty. the server mods are really bad
I do not really recommend"
2238,its good game
2239,Just Get Garry's Mod Instead
2240,niceeeeeeeeee
2241,Such a blast to run to play.
2242,j
2243,Its just half life 2 but you can play with others. Pretty fun for what it gives you but almost nobody plays it. Adds some new/cut wepons to the game and is overall really fun. If you can find someone to play it with.
2244,Quite derpy.
2245,"I would have liked this game around 10 years ago, but now its just people who scream and shout, so its lots of effort."
2246,"No server close to Indonesia. Ping 200. Players are very little, encountered only 5-6 of em, among all."
2247,awesomeness
2248,"A pretty good PvP game, it really is a fun game to get kills with decent weapons and gravity gun physics."
2249,My favourite deathmatch game.
2250,"This comes with Half-Life 2, so it's just a free addon. I don't recommend it because it is just tacked on, but it's free so it's just Steam library fluff."
2251,A really good game... but not many players.
2252,"99.9% of the servers are dead, the replayability is miniscule and even if you play with friends: Garry's Mod has what this has and more. Don't buy this under ANY circumstances!"
2253,The game's really fun. Some of the most fun I've had in gaming is screwing around in this game and CS Source GunGame servers.
2254,"I am sad not as many people are playing this anymore, love the gameplay."
2255,"Where to begin. 

Firstly, the graphics are terrible. I can't believe they want to charge 59.99 for such a terrible looking game. In 2018, we can do better. 

Second, the story. It's so boring. Yadda yadda yadda, Gordan Peeman this, Gordan Weeman that. 

Next, the gameplay. There is a stark lack of magic and wizards. 

I recommend playing the comparable yet vastly superior Citadel: Forged with Fire, a vastly superior game in every respect."
2256,"someone comment below, is this game still alive?

im too lazy to check lmfao"
2257,So i got this game for free when i got half life episode 2 or 1 and overall i think its a good game IMO tho i dont get why theres a RP server in a game like this
2258,"Ive always loved this, its my favourite deathmatch game. I wish they would update it with leaderboards and achievements etc."
2259,"Smash peoples faces in with toilets on the overplayed lockdown map on the most unpopular source engine game ever, what a joke, someone needs to revive this game or im just gonna stop playing it, also valve please fix ABHing, it would be good to be able to back pedal fast out of combat. 21/10 would play lockdown again"
2260,Very fun. Kinda weird to see HL2 as a multiplayer game.
2261,i dont like it
2262,"its fun, but no one plays it, and you can achieve the same thing in Gmod, and people actually play gmod, soooo...... play it if you got it free with hl2 but I wouldn't purchase it as a stand alone."
2263,"hl2 dm >>>>>>>> everything i think
Pros:
it has guns
Guns are funs
has that weird wall mine thing from hl1 that no one used but isn't in hl2

Cons: 

нет
also no players"
2264,Nice Game
2265,SNAS BOSS
2266,"Classic game but very dated now, only worth pence to be honest, still good to play."
2267,"Y e s. Sad that it's very far from popular - literally almost nobody plays it anymore, unfortunately. It's really good, and custom maps make it better. Despite HL2's stale gunplay and lack of weapon variety, among other things, HL2: Deathmatch is stupidly fun for some reason (willing to bet it's all thanks to the gravity gun).

It's great to play with friends who wanna play it wit'cha. The problem is the notion of a pub is practically nonexistent anymore for HL2:DM. It's only pretty much organized matches that make it last for however long it's supposed to be until people start leaving, now.

Basically, it's good. But you shouldn't buy it if you don't have any friends who also own it, nor friends who might own it but reveal zero interest in playing it with you.
Buy it if you have friends who reveal interest in it and wanna play it with you, totally worth it. It's fun as heck."
2268,no
2269,servers are empty
2270,"pretty fun but pretty fucking dead, valve pls fix"
2271,"Used to be good but it's mostly dead these days. Try one of the puzzle or coop servers on there. If you're not interested in that, don't bother with this game."
2272,OK but the ferst one was better. yet nobody plays number 1
2273,"Overview

Half-life 2: Deathmatch is a 3D multiplayer first-person shooter developed and released by Valve for the PC (via Steam) on November 30, 2004. Set in the Half-Life 2 universe, the game uses many of the original game's assets and pits players together in simple deathmatch.

In addition, the game includes a themed ""team deathmatch"" variant based on the factions in the game's story (the Combine forces against the human resistance).

Weapons

Most of the weapons from Half-Life 2 return in this game with the same functionality (including their respective alternate firing mechanisms). New to the series is a stun baton (the Stunstick) and a satchel charge (the S.L.A.M.).

-Gravity Gun - Formally known as the Zero Point Energy Field Manipulator, the Gravity Gun is the game's default weapon and is automatically given to all players. Players can use it to pick up and throw objects (including filing cabinets, toilets, and enemy grenades) at other players. Primary fire sends a blast that knocks objects in front of the player (including one that's picked up) while alternate fire attracts objects, picks them up, or sets down picked-up objects gently.

-Crowbar - A standard crowbar (Gordon Freeman's signature weapon in the Half-Life series) that is automatically given to all players in the Deathmatch mode and all Rebel players in Team Deathmatch mode.

-Stunstick - A standard stun baton that is automatically given to all Combine players in Team Deathmatch mode. Has a slower swing than the Crowbar, but deals almost double damage per hit.

-9mm Pistol - A standard fast-firing semi-automatic pistol that is given to all players. Despite being accurate, having a high ammo capacity, and having a fast firing speed, it deals significantly low damage (with the exception of headshots).

-SMG - A standard fast-firing MP7 sub-machine gun that is given to all players. Despite its low damage-per-shot, it has the highest rate-of-fire in the game and a high ammo capacity. Alternate fire tosses a small, but powerful impact grenade (which must be collected prior to firing, with a grenade capacity of 3) from the weapon.

-.357 Magnum - A powerful revolver that has a slow firing rate and very small ammo capacity. Can one-hit-kill on headshots.

-Pulse Rifle - Formally known as the Overwatch Standard Issue Pulse Rifle, the Pulse Rifle is a pulse-powered Combine assault rifle that deals more damage than the SMG (despite its lower ammo capacity and firing rate). Alternate fire fires a large Energy Ball (which must be collected prior to firing, with an ammo capacity of 3) that bounces off surfaces and vaporizes enemy players before exploding.

-Shotgun - A standard SPAS-12 pump-action shotgun that is powerful at short-to-medium range. Alternate fire has the weapon firing twice in quick succession.

-Crossbow - A powerful bolt-firing crossbow that is very effective in distant ranges, but is very hard to use (due to its very low ammo capacity, very slow reloading speed, and slow projectile speed of the bolt). Alternate fire toggles the weapon's scope, allowing players to zoom-in on their targets.

-Grenade - A standard (yet powerful) timed grenade that explodes several seconds after being thrown (via primary fire) or dropped (via alternate fire). Two grenades are given to all players as they spawn, with a maximum grenade capacity of 5.

-RPG - A very powerful rocket-propelled grenade launcher with a laser-guidance system (toggled with the alternate fire button) that allows players to steer the rocket towards the laser's destination. Has a maximum rocket capacity of 3.

-S.L.A.M. - A multi-purpose satchel charge (formally known as the Selectable Lightweight Attack Munition) that doubles as both a laser trip mine and a remotely-detonated explosive (which is detonated by the alternate fire button). Despite its lower blast radius than the other explosive weapons, it has the highest damage output. Has a maximum ammo capacity of 5."
2274,This game had a good concept. A deathmatch half life game is pretty cool. Definitely a change from half life where you could run a deathmatch server. Games pretty much dead as dirt nowadays.
2275,Yes
2276,Great!!!
2277,Half-Life 2 but it's quake iii arena.
2278,"In my personal opinion this Deathmatch is so difficult and frustrating - yet doable and addicting for its time. Best part is OPEN SERVERS and tons of players online everyday. I've made many friends playing this game, some which are now on my facebook - and I'm taking this time for a shoutout to (ØČĐ)™ WHOORAN2 AZ / USA ︻デ═一 | Best damn server host I've ever had the pleasure to share a clan with. It's been almost a decade bro, RIP 

This game came with all the fixins to make stuff yourself. Not only was there plenty of mods but the morale was just different. No one ever got upset when they died in-game because it was too hilarious with the advent of ragdoll physics. No fights or name calling. Sure you'll find that in someones server with a million rules, but not ours.  Half-Life 2 is legendary among nerds, and hwhaaaat among basic Randos. My old account had over 1k hours logged. Every day we would fight for rank in the custom user-made killbox servers which were globally popular - 


This is HL2DM it's still alive and kicking so try it out if you have rocks to handle it, however the optimization is also bad and people have terrible connections."
2279,you can kill someone with toilet 12/10
2280,terrible not fun
2281,Plays like a dream after all these years.
2282,"Disclaimer: Playtime is not accurate as I have not played the game since Steam added the playtime tracker

No I don't recommend this game because Valve has proven themselves to be a joke of a company that only cares about milking every last penny they possibly can out of their customers.

Why else is the only game that Valve has managed to get out the door lately a ♥♥♥♥ing cash-grab trading card game?

You're better off waiting for the ORIGINAL Duke Nukem Forever to get completed and then made into it's own trilogy of ""episodes"" because at this point in time it's got a hell of a lot better chance of seeing the light of day than anything from Valve with a 3 on it aside from a ♥♥♥♥ing Artifact Booster Pack Expansion Set #32

The day after Episode 2 was finished, Gaben wheeled his desk back over to his favorite project at Valve....

The SNACK TABLE"
2283,"I only used this for the RPG Servers and had a blast!

This is a basic 3D FPS but the style and model designs are really interesting and pleaseing to look at.

Sound engine can be come real immersive at points but sound real shallow during other times.

For only $5USD I say why not get this!
"
2284,A decent multiplayer game with Gmod I mean Half-Life 2. I love playing this game at school against my friends.
2285,awesome game!
2286,"Not a good game, it's too chaos"
2287,You can kill someone with a toilet 10/10
2288,dont buy it you literally get it for free with hl2
2289,The grav gun is actually really fun to use in a death match setting but I wouldn't have bought this if it didn't already come in the Valve Complete Pack.
2290,"Half-Life 2: Deathmatch is great.
But you need others to play with.
Gameplay 10/10 (Half-Life 2 but with player controlled foes.)
Graphics 10/10 (Its Half-Life 2.)
Maps 10/10 (Some maps are parts of actual HL2 chapters, some are new with different features, dm_runoff for instance has a room with some controls that slowly close two large doors trapping any other players outside the building, then the outside is ravaged with Headcrab Canisters. I like little features like this, they add more elements to the gameplay.)
Bugs 10/10 (None.)

You can get this if you want, it is good.
But there is a lack of players due to the age of this game, it is your choice if you want to get it. I got it in the Half-Life collection."
2291,pretty fun to mess around in.
2292,Best game in the world since 2004.
2293,"Using Half-Life 2's really powerful guns in a multiplayer environment is awesome! Some servers are changed a bit so you respawn immediately and this makes the game so fast, but not confusing, also too many servers use that Quake guy. Sadly, there aren't too many players left so I'd recommend only buying this if you buy it with Episode 1."

2304,better than fortnite
2305,"Gud game, should buy it."
2306,best game around .. been playing since day one
2307,hl2 with extra violence
2308,I actually really like this game. For shame that the servers are basically dead. I would love to be able to make my own server with bots and such to play with friends but i dont know how. Plus whats the point of creating a server youself with the in game option if its impossible to figure out how to get friends to join you and add bots?
2309,"great game, but a little bit of a cheater problem."
2310,there's like one server left and it's just got the same 5 russian guys yelling at eachother in it 24/7 i'm concerned for their health

2317,Really fun game

2319,Surprisingly fun when you can get other people to play it with you.
2320,"Super fun, but already dead in 2018. I can barely find servers with 10 players. Shame nobody plays it, it's really fun!"
2321,"Its so fun to throw toilets at people. We even made a shitty RP,  where toilet is my friend's wife and we protect it from rebels."
2322,you can use a toilet to kill someone
2323,"Although the community is almost dead, it is a really fun experience for only $5. There are many fun custom servers and maps to fling barrels on!"
2324,Yes
2325,10/10 would shoot toilets at friends again
2326,"Back in the day, this used to be my favourite online multiplayer game. Pity it's dead, would love to revive this locally"
2327,i cant find people to deathmatch with.
2328,Good Game! - [3/10]
2329,"Half-Life 2: Deathmatch
fast game with modern day graphics with easy controls that moves from location A to B to C and so on.

2331,"A fun little spin-off of Half-Life 2, in an arena shooter glory."
2332,too bad the multiplayer is dead but in the overall this game is sick
2333,"this is like the half life source deathmatch but the second version instead, just a multiplayer to the second game, and its as cool as the game. 8/10 would play play a dead game again"

2350,"Very amazing and very fun, if you have not played this game. You will enjoy it"
2351,"Just like Half-Life 1 Deathmatch, this game is great fun!
(When you buy this game in the pack with HL2 Episode One you get HL1 Deathmatch as well, so do that)
Since players can use the gravity gun, the battles are chaotic and hillarious. 
There are still alot of hackers on this game though. (I encountered two of them in my first hour of playing)
But I don’t really mind since every multiplayer game has cheaters somewhere, I guess I was just unlucky. I mostly play in empty servers so me and my friends can play with each other without anyone bothering us.

Overall, this is a really fun game. Go get it, it’s only 4 bucks."

2375,"I wanted to make this review short and sweet, but it's hard to stop writing, even when excluding facts that could potentially contaminate an exceptionally well thought-out gaming experience. There's just so much to say. Half-Life 2 is, simply put, the best single-player shooter ever released for the PC. It does so many things right in so many ways that it might be possible to write a thesis on the topic of Half-Life 2 compared to other single player shooters. What Valve has created is simply a masterpiece -- a work of art in the genre. Not only does it engage the mind with mysterious happenings, vagaries, and mostly intelligent dialogue, but also captures the senses with a superb visual style made possible by brilliant technology. And once the initial shock of it all wears off and it becomes possible to peel back the polished layers of sight and sound, there is an excellent shooter here. Half-Life 2 doesn't do anything particularly new; it doesn't really innovate in many ways. But what it does is set a new height for all other designers of first-person shooters to reach. It still isn't exactly perfect, but it's about as close as I've seen in my tenure here.

Before I really get into the review, you should know the background of how this game was reviewed. Valve did not want to send out copies of their game (for fairly obvious reasons) before it was released to the public. In order to play the game, I, and several of my colleagues throughout the industry, took a trip up to Seattle to visit Valve in order to have some private time with the title. I was given a little room to myself where I could close the door, turn off the lights, click my little red slippers, and pretend that I was sitting at home. It worked for the most part, largely because I was so engrossed with the game that when I came out of my trance I often had to take a moment to get my bearings. Obviously, Valve was happy to bring me into a controlled environment for ideal playing conditions."
2376,Well....You not update this and its not good for reason less player and I waste alot of money
2377,"Enjoyed this but there is a lot of hackers, not recommended"
2378,"shoot bang

this comes with half life 2 or something so yeah"

2385,"It's a really fun lil game and you can find it dirt cheap get it, it's almost as essential as gmod."
2386,"First game I ever played through steam.

My personal favorite map was the Coastal map with the button that killed everyone outside of the bunker.

good times.
"
2387,"Had to launch it to get the ""BLAST FROM THE PAST"" trophy.

Will always remember the game in which I've killed people with the gravity gun by throwing toilets at them."
2388,good
2389,Try playing this for any longer than 1 hour. I dare you.
2390,Some of the most fun I've evr had on Steam.
2391,Great game
2392,"Eh, I've said this is officially dead. It's not as cool as you'd think so, but it is some classic action taking place in the HL2 universe. There are very few servers that have enough players. I'm not in favor of this. I wouldn't get it."
2393,broken ladders
2394,diificult
2395,"[strike] This game is Valve's attempt at a Counter Strike only with Half Life. Sounds amazing on paper but terrible on reality. Half-Life's guns are OP in general so people could just run and gun with the crossbow, with the pulse rifle's combine balls etc. The game is already dead, and the remaining servers lag so much. I do not recommend this game if you want a robust multiplayer game. If you want one, I recommend Valve's Counter-Strike series. [/strike] 

06/02/2020
First of all, I like Half-Life, both the goldsrc original and it's expansions, and source engine Half Life as well. The gameplay was the best of it's time respectively for all games. Deathmatch on the other hand however in my opinion isn't really as good as other games in the series. Goldsrc Half-Life Deathmatch was actually really good because of it's fluid combat such as fast movement speed, and well balanced weapons. Half Life 2 Deathmatch was slower and had OP weapons such as gravity gun and other instant kill weapons. The only people playing the game are pros in rare servers so newcomers are unwelcomed.

Valve, if you are going back to working on the Half Life series, please do until you give us a well deserved ending."
2396,"Its pretty hard :(
"
2397,Had tons of fun with this game and many fond memories.
2398,"Nothing says ""GET DUNKED ON!"" more than getting killed by a toilet launched by a gravity gun."
2399,"most fun I've had in a while. Wish there were achivements, though. With that aside, 10/10."
2400,"I had a lot of fun on this game back in 2010/2011-ish, playing co-op, killbox, or just normal DM. Still kind of surprised that it has a semi-active playerbase, not a big one but still active. If you like the half life fighting mechanics then i recommend this game."
2401,This was my childhood. So yeah 10/10
2402,Big yup for me
2403,"I miss this game so much, I miss how excited the community would get over a release from valvE and I miss being excited for new games... Half-Life 3 may never be released but at least this timeless masterpiece can truly go down as the number 1 FPS ever created and I won't say I'm the number one fan but damn I have so many good memories thanks to this games and spin offs... Truly sad to finially say I've lost hope in valvE, Money is all they are worried about but if there is one thing you should buy its this game and all of the other half-lifes."
2404,"Well this isn't gonna be the longest review, because this isn't the longest of games.
What this is, is basically an arena type shooter with HL2 characters and other textures. A bunch of fun in small portions.
I'm pretty well seasoned in Counter-Strike (mostly the newest edition), so playing this was a piece of cake. Surprisingly, I could find servers almost full of people playing this, so at least in EU you can expect that you might actually get to play it.
There isn't a story whatsoever, because that exists in a different game - Half-Life 2 of course. I reckon this game is just meant to be a fun shooter, but if it wasn't abandoned, it could've been a lot better.
The maps are okay, not too much going on but not completely plain either. Haven't played it in a while, but I'm gonna throw it out that there might be different weaponry available depending on the map you're playing on.

Overall, a 6/10. An ok game, but clearly not enough effort from Valve. Maybe it was just an experimentation from their side."
2405,This game is five dollars??? They should pay me five dollars to play this game.
2406,pretty good game when it come to half life 2 team deathmach
2407,fuck yeah half life woo

2410,"Well, in 2018 decided to play quick deathmatch game with a friend.

The game installs almost instantly. But then...

- There is an option to create server, but looks like it is not visible in ""find server"" menu;
- Friends do not see me playing at my shiny new server;
- Ok, joining to some other server: random people, some crappy made custom maps and shit music broadcasted right into ur headphones! Irritating as f-k;
- Trying to adjust some settings: go to options, it hangs for a while... Wait, what is it doing? Why on Earth it starts my steam-VR?! Closing steamVR and guess what - the game also closes! WTF?!!

Very upset. Can't believe this shit happens in 2018 for such a great game."
2411,it gud
2412,It is really a great game. Can help you in aiming with fast gameplay.
2413,Just dont. Too many pros and addicts on servers
2414,You have the fun parts of Half-Llife 2. Without the incredibly great story. This game came free with my copy of CS:Source back 9 or so years ago. I love hopping on and just getting hit with that nostalgia and my wishes for Half-Life 3.
2415,this is a good review
2416,This is a REALLY fun game! I played it for 1.3 hours straight and dominated a lobby while my friend was passed out on my floor. good shit.
2417,Half Life 2 is sooooo good.  Valve made the best games...
2418,It's a shame more people don't play this game
2419,The people you meet in the chat are a very kind community. I highly recommend this game. I received this game from the orange box.
2420,"This game is actually pretty decent. Its a good use for the source engine but its a pitty, that not that many people play it. Okay  let me get into the pros and cons.

Pros: the game is not in anyway p2p and the fighting is pretty quick and nobody dies too quickly.  Also the maps and the gunplacements are pretty good

Cons: i personally think that the gravity gun gets too much use. I think that it should be the Combine vs the rebels but if team killing is on, the the whole server turns into a free for all clusterf***k. The revolver and the crossbow are pretty overpowered and theyre pretty much the only weapons that people use. Otherwise people just use the gravity gun and shove every physics prop possible to the enemys rear hole"
2421,"Cool, but it gets bored 3 hours after you play"

2454,"What can I say?

One of the best games I own and one that never fails to impress! No detectable bugs (at least no major ones) and a perfect 1st person shooter. Half Life 2: Deathmatch takes a different veiw on how a shooter should be played. This and its gorgious graphics make it an extremely popular shooter that is always fun and enjoyable. Its a great game to play with friends as well as the vast community.

There are many different maps avaliable ranging from underground bunkers to almost any Half Life 2 map you could think of.

Overall, I'd say get this game as it is worth the full price!"
2455,"Well balanced, the gravity gun is a very cool weapon, and you start with good weapons. Not a ton of players but there are players."
2456,"The number of hours I have on this account is not relevant since I owned this game since its release back in 2004.

With that being said, here is my brief review over the years.

Firstly, do I recommend this game? The answer's [u]no[/u]. It has nothing to do with the game being terrible but rather with what it has become. If you want to buy it, wait for it to be on sale, which is usually a dollar.

Over the years, Valve has shown no interest in updating the game anymore, and even if there are any updates, those are generally bug fixes. It makes sense with Counter:Strike: Global Offensive being their top 1 game. That being said, though, Team Fortress 2 came out 3 years after Half-Life 2 and still receives much love today. Only Counter-Strike: Source, Day of Defeat: Source, Half-Life 2: Deathmatch and GoldSrc games have been left to die (if they aren't already).

I mostly played competitive during my 14 or so years and despite all this, I still find myself level designing for the game because I just can't move on to level designing for another game, and I have tried.

Pros: Hecha para PC de Patatas o tostadoras
        -Gran variedad de Mapas oficiales y fan made
        - La Gravity Gun (en serio)
        - Te viene gratis con la Orange Box sin que lo sepas
        - Armas locas.

Cons: -Servidores Raros que te decargan un monton de sonidos y texturas y te tarda como diez minutos
         - No vas a encontrar jugadores de tu idioma ( español) o region
          -Campers y Tryhards (muy, muy Hards)
          - Comunidad y Player Base que se muere poco a poco

Veredicto: Es un buen juego para jugar con amigos, pero lo recomiendo SOLO si compraste la Orange Box, Ya que ahora no vale mucho la pena comprarlo (Te podrias comprar el Garrys Mod o Ahorrar para un CS.)

2477,This game isnt bad. The only problem I have with it is the fact that the VAC securing doesnt work period.
2478,Unbeatable
2479,"Pretty fun.

Not that many people play it anymore, but there's some good maps. The HL2 weapons lend themselves well enough to deathmatch, and while there's not quite a rock paper scissors thing going, the RPG doesn't automatically mean you're going to kill anyone. The revolver, while powerful, still doesn't mean you're going to shoot to the top of the scoreboard. And the humble gravity gun, while an excellent tool... can be countered by anyone else's.

This is just one of those FPSes that has a very unique style of play. Outgunning everyone else isn't always going to get you anywhere. Your shotgun doesn't mean anything if they have a barrel held up with a gravity gun. Your barrel might not help if they have an RPG or a grenade handy. And that RPG can be countered by a tidy headshot with the revolver. And that revolver in turn could be dealt with by and SMG grenade or AR2 pulse, etc.

Tons of fun, and cheap."

2523,"Very well done, but unforunately every server has been heavily modded (unlimited ammo, flying, etc.) to the point that I do not find it enjoyable to play. I am also not sure if it was simply the servers I was on or something that was overlooked by the developers, but there didn't seem to be any win criteria or team deathmatch,"

2537,I'm just reviewing all the games in my library. I have no memories whatsoever of this game. But it's Half-Life. Instantly 10/10.
2538,"it IS good, but it's dead :( nearly no players"
2539,Thank you valve for this game! :)
2540,I like this game and the style I recommend buying this game
2541,awesome game
2542,Lots of classic hl2 death-match. Throw a toilet today!
2543,Rip off of cod and hl2
2544,"- Very fun and enjoyable experiences. Sadly, the game is already done, almost all of its servers are dead empty and only a few remain with high latency. Even if you want to stay in, there is nothing much else to do as there exists no time limit per match or any goals, you just shoot till you're bored and out.
- There is no rewards, no progressions system, the ranking is just there to make you feel like you achieve at least something, yet it doesn't matter when you rise from #80K to #5K within 1.4hrs of gameplay. 
- The guns are fun, but you will end up using mainly rockets, pulse rifle, grenade and shotgun anyway due to their op power. And further more, the gravity gun - the main point of the series - is pretty useless as the map's environment is pretty bland, don't expect to take advantage of any objects or physics as promised by Valve
- And of course, don't forget this is a Source game, so expect the glitches
. 
To sum it all, HL2:Deathmatch is a ghost town that Valve abandoned forever, you can still have fun with it, then you will move on and never look back. And with that reason, I cannot recommend it despite being a solid 7/10 game"
2545,Endless fun. A Valve classic.
2546,"bom pra buseta

2547,"The game itself is action-packed and makes good use of HL2's gunplay, but if you are someone who can't stand annoying gaming communities (like me) then don't bother getting this game. Less than 200 players are on this game at a time and I feel like a quarter of them are adults who take the game way too seriously. I had to quit the first three servers I tried joining because players were arguing or trying to make other players feel bad. I know I could just mute their mics but that kind of takes away a big element of the game. I can see how this game could be fun with friends but at that point you might as well just screw around with them on Gmod, where you have way more options.

I played this game only because it came free with HL2 (or one of the HL2 episodes, I can't remember), so I definitely wouldn't recommend buying it itself. Spend your money wiser and get Gmod, or save it altogether and get TF2 where you might actually meet some good-humored people."
2548,"This game is a lot of fun but sadly not very many active players which is the only thing holding this back im sure it was amazing when it was alive the gameplay is still very fun though, however it is not worth buying on its own i recommend getting this with the orange box"
2549,"No one is playing this, but it must have been great when it came out."
2550,Are you kidding me? This is just amazing. Kill your friends in the source engine. That's all I have to say about this amazing meme game
2551,"Not fun or good. Don't buy this. Horrible mix since its a twitch based shooter with poor movement but yet all the enemies are bullet sponges unless you spam the revolver. Game is not fun and all the maps just have major exploits or over powered spots 40 year old virgins sit in all day. If you want to get groomed by people with super low IQ, this game is for you."

2555,"No excuse that this wasn't included with the main game. It's cookie cutter multiplayer, except with the gravity gun. No matter how good the single-player is, it's irrelevant to its multiplayer counter-part."
2556,"Yeah it was fun, BACK IN THE DAY"
2557,"Half-Life 2: Deathmatch

This game is fun, really fun. You should check High-Kill servers, those offer you really coof features like llow gravity and infinite ammo. This might get you frustrated at first, but after configuring the game a bit, you will most likely start toe njoy this. I mean I did a lot. Worth picking up at sale at least.

2559,"My first online game, I owe so many things to this game, Old School magic, it's amazing that there are still players. Keep it up!"
2560,"If you can stand the aggravatingly long load times and the constant beatdowns, Deathmatch is honestly one of the best parts about the Half Life 2 experience, and I would recommend it to anyone who is a fan of the series or FPS in general. The over the top on-your-toes action keeps every match a challenge, if not a little tedious. But like the base game, boy if it isn't good fun (almost) every step of the way."

2586,"I know what you're thinking so far, don't lie. You think this isn't worth your money, that it is just a cheap spin-off.

You are wrong... wait, no you aren't. It probably is a cheap spin-off, actually...

It might be that, but it is FUN. I was never a fan until I joined the High-Kill servers: Ridiculously fast-paced servers with low gravity and infinite ammo, where every kill is a spawn kill.

It will frustrate you at first, but turn your DPI, Framerate, and Reaction Times up and it is immensely satisfying. Every kill is a YouTube-worthy event, especially in slow motion. I recorded tens of hours and hundreds of gigabytes of footage. Because that's the thing. This game makes you WANT to record. After the first kill, you think ""Holy Crap, nobody will ever see that again! How could this happen!"" and you promply turn on your screen recorder. However, not recording it makes it that much enjoyable, knowing that every kill is an event that only you will witness.

Anyway, maybe I'm rambling, but maybe this mod is worth your money. Go get it."
2587,"I don't know if this game is worth it. I had pretty high expectations for this game, because i was used to the half-life style of play, but there are people who play nonstop who can easily kill you, not to mention the people that hack the game to get more kills. I like the maps, they really have a half-life feel, but like a lot of games, i think the community ruined this one. Honestly i'd give it a 5/10."

There are no servers that I could join with a reasonable ping that also kept default deathmatch settings, they are instead all customised and filled with extremely proficient players who can snipe me from across the map even with the most inaccurate, fully-automatic guns. The rest of these servers have 0 players online at all times."

This is superb but keep in mind that it came out over a decade ago. Just wish there were more players now since most of the FPS games are boring except for a couple honorable mentions. I really miss the old days where I would come back from school and play this. 

The weapons are more diverse and fun to use, and there is also a suit-zoom function that makes the .357 magnum as deadly as a fucking sniper."

2646,"Half-Life 2: Deathmatch is a multiplayer first-person shooter video game developed by Valve Corporation. Released on Steam on November 30, 2004, it uses many of the assets from Half-Life 2 and its Source engine. That being said, this game was an after thought, Valve has never really cared about this game or its fan base. With the exception of Counter-Strike this game is/was one of the most exploited, buggy, and hacked multiplayer games on the Source Engine. With every new update it got worse and worse. Now all negative thoughts aside the game did have one of the best advanced movement mechanics of any game I've ever played, again with another exception of HL2DM Pro Mod/AG2. As of the time of writting there are less than 300 servers and only a dozen or so cater to vetran players like myself. I've worked in the modding scene and level design for this game for several years to try and bring a new player base to this game but that only goes so far. This entire game needs to be reworked from the ground up starting with netcode. Sad to say if someone asked me today what I thought of it I would have to say it is bad, look elsewhere for a better arena shooter like Toxikk or Quake."

I know this game may be dead with only 2 populated servers but if you play on Pirates cove u know how ragey, Hillarious and fun this game is. Pirates cove is a fun server that breaks the weapon rules of half life 2 and gets you a weak character with super powerful weapons. The default pistol is the best weapon due to its speed and dammage but the magnum is a really good sniper. Its a cheap game and most of the shooters today are over complicated and this game is simple and fun. So i completely recommend it and if you don't want to spend the 4 dollars on it just wait till a sale because it goes on sale often and usally 90% off. 
P.s: this game is ragey and i broke my mouse and keyboard's bluetooth adaptor so be prepared."

2660,"I absolutely love the half life series and all the games, I recommend every single one of the games but am extremely disappointed in valve. The complete lack of ANY communication for TEN YEARS is completly disgusting, It is disrepectful to the fans who supported valve for years. Its sad that valve doesnt even have the courtesy to tell their fans that half life is dead. It is clear that we will never get a satisfying ending to an amazing story. I personally am not interested in anything valve has released since Episode 2, and if the single player story driven masterpieces of recent years are anything to go by, its that valve only cares about its games as service titles, and not their narative driven campaigns. I am deeply upset that we will never get to explore the atmospheric and exciting universe of half life again. Valve prides themselves on their independance and flat workplace structure, but its clear there is a lack of focus. Valve, like too many companies in the video games industry, seem to be too blinded on following the money, they have left behind those that got them there in the first place..."

At this point, the resistance will have failed or succeeded, no thanks to me. Old friends have been silenced, or fallen by the wayside. I no longer know or recognize most members of the research team, though I believe the spirit of rebellion still persists.

At this stage valve corporation doesn't think that video games is a form of art but rather a form of business.

Art can't exist without sacrifice. And current valve employees are unwilling to sacrifice this cash cow in the name of art.

Besides the light echo of peripheral footfall and HEV suit-charging it's eerily quiet. That is, until the Rebels step out against the Combine: barrel-chested, leather-skinned and bloodthirsty—an inevitable eruption of gunfire, pulse orbs and exploding frag grenades follows.  

Since its arrival two weeks after Half-Life 2's mid-November 2004 launch, Lockdown has been one of Half-Life 2: Deathmatch's most popular 2v2 maps. Top players have came and went since, however TheRealQuAz and Maxtasy are long-serving veterans who've occupied its online multiplayer wargrounds since 2008. 

Observing in god-like spectator mode, I look on in awe as these experts exchange blows with two lesser players; dancing around the map and executing fatal maneuvers with a level of precision that's owed to years of experience. Each dash, bunnyhop and meticulously-placed gravity gun-fired grenade is measured and is the result of refined strategy—it seems fitting the monochrome floor mirrors that of a chess board. Within mere minutes the commanding duo is fifteen points to the good.

Nowadays, casual matches are as good as it gets for HL2DM's most serious devotees. Of the 300 or so active daily players, around half are preoccupied with the game's Roleplay mode—a temperamental server which while hosting a huge map that lets players work, rent houses, commit crimes, and go to prison, isn't nearly as sophisticated—nor as fun—as it may sound. 

""You have a bank account and earn money just for being on the server, and you can buy items with that money,"" explains Maxtasy. ""A lot of people just stay idle on the server to farm cash. That's why these servers are usually at the top of the server browser and new players to the game usually join the most populated servers and get a weird first impression of the game, sadly.""

Of the remaining 150 or so folk who tend towards the game's default modes, the chances of finding players fit to challenge the likes of Maxtasy and TheRealQuaz are few and far between. Of course this wasn't always the case. 

In 2006, two years after the multiplayer's inception, HL2DM was a regular in Steam's top ten most played games, pulling in upwards of 20,000 players per day. For competitive players, Clans United was established as the game's central European community website and over a six year period hosted 1v1, 2v2 and 3v3 leagues which, at its peak, spanned five divisions with eight teams in each field. A hefty waiting list was perpetually on standby, whereby new teams would only replace outfits relegated from the lowest leagues. 

At the same time, less significant forums such as HL2DM University were chartered, and a US ESL community ran a semi-successful 1v1 ladder. After players failed to shift Serino—no longer active but widely considered one of the best HL2DM players of all time—from the top spot after several months, though, the latter was eventually dissolved and absorbed by Clans United.         

""Division one had some of the most skilled teams and players ever seen in the game,"" says Quaz. ""It's strange to me that HL2DM was overlooked by the wider community considering the elite level of the top pros is so impressive to watch. But although host to some of the greatest matches ever played, the league and community always had some drama or scandal going on, whether it be cheating accusations, admin abuse or mismanagement."" 

In September 2010 Valve upgraded HL2DM to utilise the Orange Box version of the Source Engine—a move which disabled a well-used crouch bug that in turn vastly altered the game's bunny hop mechanic. For many players this meant relearning the game from scratch and compromised six years-worth of practice. As such, a number of teams withdrew from competitive play and by 2012 just two divisions remained. 

It was then Quaz formed his first clan with two similarly prolific players of the time, Lancelot and Bangelo, who went on to win their debut season outright without dropping a single map. Normal procedure dictated that the top team would thereafter progress to the next league—in this case from division four into division three—however a coinciding league restructure levied by the game's admins saw the introduction of a new lower division, and thus saw Quaz and his team were forced to stay put. This didn't sit well with Bangelo and after several formal protests fell on deaf ears he quit the competitive scene entirely, causing Quaz and Lancelot to carry on in a separate 2v2 league. 

In late 2012, Quaz gained admin rights to one of the remaining divisions, yet he himself was becoming increasingly disillusioned with the community due to several ongoing spats regarding team allegiance and admin disputes. Quaz describes the HL2DM scene as ""stagnant"" around this time and, having shared the gossip with Bangelo, passed over his admin details to allow his ex-teammate to browse the acrimony for himself. 

""I gave the admin forum password to my teammate Bangelo with no malicious intent, just so he could have a chance to troll around on the private admin forums,"" Quaz explains. ""Somehow he managed to delete the entire database of the site, much of which had not been backed up. Only an incomplete series of hall of fame pictures survived. This is pretty much how Clans United went down. I guess I owe it to the community to tell the whole story as they deserve to know and might not already.""

From the outside looking in, it's difficult to view Bangelo's actions as anything but intentional. ""To be honest, I don't remember all the details,"" Quaz adds. ""I'm not sure exactly what happened internally but it had mixed reactions from the community—some people were obviously annoyed, including me, that much of the history of the game was lost. Others praised Bangelo for deleting Clans United as many players resented the management and felt its time had finally come. People just didn't care as much, despite Clans United being a cornerstone of Half-Life 2: Deathmatch for many great years, which is how it should be remembered."" 

In the wake of Clans United, the Old School Community was formed in 2013 which aimed to replicate and replace its predecessor. It's still live today however the same level of interest has never been achieved, and the OSC in its most modern guise instead caters for whichever 'top' players can be bothered stopping by. With other Valve franchises still hugely popular—not least Counter-Strike and Team Fortress 2—one might wonder why HL2DM has failed to garner the same long-term support. 

Maxtasy describes his multiplayer of choice as ""Valve's forgotten child"", while Quaz points to the perceived steep learning curve of hitting top rank in HL2DM coupled with the advent of esports as possible reasons it got left behind—this and the fact Valve makes a killing from CS:GO's skin economy.
 
=VERDICT=
Like the demise of any community, it's sad to see something once so active fade. But with Half-Life 2: Deathmatch it seems so many variables have worked against it for some time. It's trapped by the advent and ever-growing popularity of esports, and trapped by the Half-Life brand itself and the fact Half-Life 3 might never happen. It's almost ironic that HL2DM's most iconic map is set in a prison. Its most skilled players continue to battle on its dimly-lit concourse, every twitch trick-shot a callback to the game's energetic heday."

2696,Better than CSGO
2697,I used the Gravity Gun to kill a guy with a toilet.
2698,epicness
2699,"this would actually be a fun game in multiplayer, well it is but its slowly dying
i just wish there was bots in this game and start up a server with them like CS:S, CS:GO, TF2, eta
still seems like a great game if the multiplayer was lit"
2700,"The games a classic.

Whether that's throwing a toilet at your friend, doing more damage than an RPG to hopping around lobbing grenades at combines this game is a blast. Most of my time was spent on playing community server mostly CoLD Community, a role play server I personally find better than most modern day G-Mod role plays. This game is worth giving a shot considering it's dead state."
2701,"Pretty good multiplayer take of HL2, but I feel it should've been a seperate mode in the base game instead of being its own game. You won't find many people playing on its servers anymore sadly."

2708,"This game is really fun,just like all the other half-life multiplayer games,it is also the most active yet,its much more skill based than the games before and there are many tricks that you can use to gain an advantage over new players.

Pros
-fun gameplay
-still kinda alive
-tricks 'n stuff
-new weapons


cons
-weird movement
-weird textures some times

i recomend this to every half life fan"
2709,"This game is lots of fun. 

You start this game up, you get into a server and you have a blast.

The game doesn't have many players but when you find the right server you have a huge amount of fun.

The surviving community is friendly, most of the time and using the Half-Life 2 weapons on other players is very satisfying.

This game is very good and it comes with Half-Life 2: Episode 1 which is a one up for me.

7.5/10 Would kill someone with a toilet again."
2710,"I still have the CS:S dvd which includes HL2DM and DOD:S.

Fun fact: The multiplayer in this game is ""1 DVD PER PC"""
2711,"First of all I can't really say anything about the current status of the game, for example, if there are still enough players and servers, since I played this game years ago - 8/10

When I played this with my friends this were some of my best moments of gaming. You can have so much fun battling with your friends. The ultimate fun of Half-Life 2 gameplay combined with multiplayer has to be awesome. If you have some friends and a server to play on, I ensure you, you will have a great time."
2712,"I Freaking love this game so much! It's sort of like call of duty, but for low end PCs and on the ground."
2713,Toilet murder
2714,good game
2715,This game is the best
2716,lol
2717,"I would want to play this game, but nobody play this game."
2718,Can't find any servers that don't require you to download mods and downloading mods takes forever in this game.
2719,it's alright but not as good as the first one
2720,funny shoot hjaha
2721,"still the classic shooter, IMHO"
2722,"Well, I'm sure it was good while it lasted."
2723,still bad graphics
2724,"At first i thought this was a dead game and a waste of money but after playing for like 1 hour i really started to enjoy it.
Now I can't stop playing it :D"
2725,"You want a cheap arena shooter? Buy this. It's good. Some people are still playing this. And you don't need Half-Life 2 to play this.
Edit: I've nominated this for the Steam Awards, because why not"
2726,"The servers are less dead than Ace of Spades

10/10 would kill a person with a toilet again"

2738,"I haven't touched this in years, but I remember this as some of the most hilarious mayhem of all time. Multiplayer is everything the gravity gun ever needed."
2739,"Oh HLD:DM, how I've missed you so.

This was the first online multiplayer game I ever played, and ultimately the reason I favored PC gaming as a kid when everyone else my age had no idea what it even was. I remember when I was just a chubby wee lad back in 2004 playing this game with his dad on his crappy PC, pulling all-nighters, hosting his own server and trying to find any persnickety little reason to ban/kick people, getting banned from servers for my squeaky voice, and spending hours upon hours in Source SDK making coop and obstacle course maps. It was great fun. I was afraid that the game would be dead after coming back to check on it after so many years. Fortunately, it's not, but it is reaching its death throes.

There's still a reasonable amount of people who play (around 200 at peak I think), it's just saddening to see that there's not as many as there used to be, naturally. Most of the servers have relatively high ping, and many of the amazing servers we all remember like Joe Scoma's coop server and Singe's server for VERY unique and well made custom maps are no longer in existence. However, I still managed to find some of the maps I used to play way back in the day like dm_airstrike (literally the first map I ever played), dm_wtc_singe, and dm_steamlab and they just brought me back.

HL2:DM, I love you."
2740,"Its a gud game about half life 2, but get this, its m u l t i p l a y e r and P V P"
2741,Classic deathmatch that is still enjoyable to play on in the year 2017. It is all about the gravity gun. Still worth while purchasing. Plenty of servers where people play on. Some very good players that haunt the servers too. Highly recommend.

Where is official maps?
Can't create a server to play with friend online."

I have had hundreds of hours of fun and I would recommend this game to anyone. Sadly the community is much smaller than it used to be, but there is still people playing. You can still find servers with big player bases but for certain game modes there are few or none at all."

2780,"The game is now dead, all servers are russian or empty 24/7 Wouldn't recommend buying anymore, look at Counter Strike"
2781,Feels more like a mod than an actual game. The community is cancer filled with 22 year virgins screaming on their microphones the entire time. Depending on how masochistic you are that can be a terrible or funny experience. It was only like 49 cents so I'm not too disapointed.

2787,"Get ready for some insane, looney action with your friends! Half Life 2: Deathmatch is the game for all the people who loved the Half Life 2 games, and wanted to have some deathmatch with friends in the Half Life 2 universe! This simple, but fun, crazy game will fit all your needs, where you can use the crowbar or stunstick as a combine or resistance soldier!

Pros:

Half Life 2. Why not?
Crowbars. When all else fails, grab your crowbar and whack em!
Graphics and levels are based off of sections of the original games.
Toss a toilet? Damn right you heard!

Cons:

Playermodel selection is broken, so you'll have to open the developer console and type in cl_playermodel models/humans/group03 then choose male or female numbers.
Not a whole lot of people play, only a few west USA servers
Game is very old for it's time. 

Overall? I recommend this game for the people who enjoyed the Half Life 2 games, and wanted to have some deathmatch within the HL2 universe. If you want to play co-op with your friends, download Synergy, you'll need HL2 required to play though.
"
2788,"Not enough people still play this for it to be worth 5$, however enough do that it can still be very fun at the right times of day. Get it on sale/10"
2789,I love this i have like 50-60 fps I am getting fps drops only when i see a black cock under my table raping my cooler. But with out of this its good game With few players i enjoy playing it and the game is very cheap on sale.
2790,"Have you ever been playing Half-Life 2 and wished you could shoot Rebels instead of Combine? (I know I did.) Well now you can thanks to the online-only Half-Life 2 Death Match. Released all the way back in 2004 for the PC, it only recently come to Mac courtesy of Valve's Steam service.
I actually don't like Half-Life 2 as much as Half-Life 1. I recognize it as a great game, just one that doesn't appeal to me. I like the story, the characters and setting. But there is one thing I can't stand: The combat. Something about it just feels really stilted and awkward. I could never quite be sure why, I just knew I didn't like it. So I was a little hesitant to pick up HL2 Death Match, but what did I find? It's not only good - it's ridiculously fun. Placing the game in a fast paced frag-fest somehow transformed it from being unplayable, to immensely enjoyable.

The premise here is simple: Get on a team or a Free For All (FFA) Map and start shooting. There's no multiple game types, complicated maps or weapons. But the game's simplicity is also in its favor. It's easy to learn and jump right into and have a good time without having a learning curve. Unless of course you are completely new to shooters online, you will be having fun right away.

Maps are diverse without being confusing. There are a number of larger outdoor settings in which to get around or several indoor settings where hallways are narrow confines that define the combat arena. One map has a control room which launches a missile after a few minutes that kills everyone outside. Once you hit the button an alarm goes off and everyone scrambles to get inside as the blast doors close. It's thrilling to slip under them just as they shut, but then you are locked indoors for a minute with everyone else trying to survive until the doors open again.

Half-Life 2's excellent physics are on full display here as crates and objects break, glass shatters, and the ragdoll of your dead enemy crumbles oh-so satisfyingly to the ground after a shotgun blast to the head. Explosions of any kind also cause hilarious results, with bodies flying through the air, and bouncing off walls due to a well placed grenade or rocket blast.

If you haven't played HL2, then the weapon load-out is also simple, but unique enough to keep things interesting. Everyone starts with a melee weapon, a pistol, a submachine gun and two grenades. So when you spawn you aren't helpless. In standard death match fashion, better weapons, ammo, armor and health are strewn about the maps for you to pickup. Learning the spawn locations of the superior weaponry will certainly help you get a leg up over the competition. My personal favorites are the shotgun, and the crossbow which serves as the game's sniper weapon. You also get an energy machine gun, and laser-mines which can be set on walls or the ground for the unsuspecting passer-by.

I found the rocket-launcher to be a little unwieldy as it's laser-guided only, so you can't just shoot and forget. If you move your aimer, the rocket follows. This works for and against you, I found. Suffice to say if you see a red laser dot near you or on a teammate, get out or the next thing you see will be your limp body flying through the air.

Most guns also have an alternate fire. The shotgun can fire two shells at once, the submachine gun can pickup grenades for an underhand launcher, and the energy gun can also get an insta-kill ball of plasma that fries your opponents into little bits. But most unique of all is that everyone also starts with a Gravity Gun which allows you to push or pickup objects and then shoot them at other players. Almost anything you pickup serves as an instant death, whether it's a crate, table, shovel or toilet you launch. High-use gravity gun matches are humorous as all manner of objects fly around the map in an attempt to crush the opposing team or players.

The game is of course built on Valve's own Source engine, and despite being a little dated the game still looks great. It's not going to win any awards these days, but it's still visually pleasing and it certainly doesn't detract from the experience. Since it doesn't have the fanciest eye-candy around, the game should easily run on just about any computer, unless you have one that is more than several years old. I encountered the occasional odd spawning glitch, or visual bug but it was rare, and the game was smooth and never crashed.

Sound also remains minimal with no music. What you will be hearing is the patter of footsteps, the constant chatter of gunfire, muffled explosions or the sound of dying. I personally like to put on some iTunes to blast away to, but the minimalistic approach to sound doesn't take away from the gameplay at all. What is there stands out sharply and clearly with no interference and allows you to easily identify what is going on. Voice chat is also present, which is easy to use with the press of a button, and is crisp and clear.

At only $5, and a few cents when on sale, Half-Life 2 Death Match is a no-brainer. Whether you are a Half-Life fan to begin with, or just a fan of online shooters, the game is simple, outrageous fun. It's easy to jump into, but remains entertaining even after hours of play. The player-base is great, and there's always several matches available to hop into for Team play or FFA. Buy it and start launching toilets and barrels at your friends today."
2791,This game is super fun and I would recommend it... Especially when it's on sale...
2792,How come this old game handles multiplayer physics so good and nowadays game doesn't? Is there actually a similar deathmatch game that can match this one? I don't think so.

If enemies is in my crosshair then they teleport out of my crosshair when i shoot, all enemies teleport over my crosshair.
All enemies teleport from a dangerous spot to a safe spot. If there is 2 seconds of walk they would die at, then they teleport over that ''2 seconds of walk spot'' Alot more of these things was happening, they change binds, graphics & settings ingame all the time, i always had sabotaged 100% of my time in cs go + Dota2. When i should be 6k in dota 2 before i even tried the game & global elite MANY years before i tried cs go. They change my binds, sentivity & graphics all the time when i was ingame in cs go + dota2.
Valve company should be closed down for their corruption. valve sholdn't even be alowed to exist, they are corrupted psychopaths sabotaging 100% of my time in dota 2, cs go.
They are even disabling some of my hotkeys & doing that alot when i write reviews, so i need to change everything i wrote becourse 10% of the time one of my keyboard button was disabled by valve.

They are even freezing my screen for 1sec in any pvp game on steam, it just never happen in the many 1000s games i played outside steam.

Valve is corrupted swindlers, just like many other video game companies. 
Video game companies always sabotage my time in pvp games by using my keyboard, disable hotkeys and million of these kind of things."
2818,"I have fond memories of playing this gamee with my dad and brothers. Unfortunately it seems hard to find many nice populated servers anymore. You would probably be better off going to tf2 or cs:go if you looking for a multi player shooter.
Nice for a trip down memory lane though."
2819,good
2820,Pretty fun game. Still has around 100 or so people playing so it's still alive. If you liked Counter Strike or Team Fortress Classic you will like this one too.
2821,"I must say I have no complaints so far, It's a very good FPS"
2822,An Instant Classic!
2823,"I like this, its like Half Life 2 and Counter Strike Source had a baby, and it was retarded but likable"
2824,"good game but no one plays it anymore
remeber that cool thing seagull did a while back in this lmao?"
2825,Boring.
2826,hacky  aaaa
2827,"I strongly recommend this game if you have a few friends into it, because the server aren't very active as this game is quite old reaching its 10 year mark. This game is a very fast paced FPS based off the widely known Half Life 2. It shares the same features as Half Life 2 but a Player vs Player system."
2828,dead af and the few populated servers are full of hackers
2829,"A bit of an old game but a game that you can have hours and hours of fun with friends and randoms!

Sadly no achievements or steam cards"
2830,Half Life 2 Deathmatch is fun and a great way to turn a good game into a team based shooter game. Overall it's fun!
2831,i have no idea why the fuck valve made this but if you're looking for half life 2 but with more shooting and multiplayer elements get it lmao
2832,"Awesome game, I like the Cooperative servers as much as the Deathmatch servers!
After couple of years i still think its a very awesome source game. 
Also I generally love Source games ive played all of them this one i'd rather play than CS:S or CS:GO.
I totally recommend looking at the Cooperative servers with adventure maps, horror maps etc. !"
2833,"Can't say that Half-Life 2 is a perfect game for deathmatch, but it can be really fun while playing with friends."
2834,"My requirements of a GOOD game:

Fun Game: ✔
Linux Port: ✔
Good developers: ✔

Optional:

Indie: ✘
Good fanbase: ✔

2835,lol funney game recommend for your kids :))
2836,"Bounced, or rather bunny hopped, right off of this unsatisfying multiplayer experience.  Tone of the world and its weapons don't fit the physics and mechanics of the gameplay."
2837,"It is good but it should have been improved, only thing you can do is killing your opponent. Mods like jailbreak, soccer or roleplaying should have been added. You can have it with Valve Pack, it's only worth with pack."
2838,"This is the most stupid, brainless, insane, chaotic and incomprehensible multiplayer deathmatch shooter I've ever played.

And I love it."
2839,"Best game ever 10/10 would kill people with a toilet again. 

I can now die happily."
2840,"This was one of the first games I have ever played and I have to admit it aged well.

"
2843,"This is one of those games you think are dumb as fuck and dead, but when you find some active servers you will play on them for hours straight. This multiplayer is just too fun not to give it a try, it's best to play it with friends because how funny it can be at times. Having a lot of 1 hit kill weapons is so funny (and fun), but it's not inbalanced."
2844,Ugh
2845,Great game evern after all these years.  Defintely a classic :)
2846,Bad...
2847,this one is ok+
2848,Half-Life 2: Deathmatch
2849,"got propkilled the whole time i played, 10/10"
2850,The game provides great fun for long hours of play. Physics used in the game differs from those in other Half-Life games. Thanks to Gravity Gun we can throw objects away. This makes the game even more varied.
2851,Highly reccomended. Very fun purely because of how many horribly modded servers there are. There's no shortage of laughably weird but enjoyable maps to play.
2852,"There is just no end to the possibilities that you can do in deathmatch, well, maybe there is, but I continue to believe that the possibilities are infinite.  The weapons set is incredible, fun, and creative; my favorite being the gravity gun.  Despite how old this game is, the game was way ahead of its time and is the most solid, entertaining, fun multiplayer FPS game that I've played.  I recommend for any hardcore fps players looking for a unique deathmatch experience."
2853,"Tags: Multiplayer Based
Additional Tags: Delete Local Content & Remove from Library

TLDR: Populated by a fringe population of veterans when it is not inactive. This game's community would be hard to penetrate and establish yourself a niche in. And why would you, given all the wealth of choices you have for your multiplayer sessions of deathmatch.  Engine is dated."
2854,its a fun multiplayer fps game to play with friends
2855,This is the best game ever.
2856,Game doesn't look bad. Like CS only with Half Life 2 weapons. Not worth your money today if you havent played it before.
2857,great for lan parties!
2858,"What was once an addicting time waster, is now a forgotten game sadly..."
2859,First steam game I got. Filled the void before I could afford Garry's mod. This game WAS my preteen years.
2860,game full of mean kids
2861,An absolute classic. The first game I ever played on Steam years and years ago. The most fun you can have with your pants on!
2862,"This game was released before Half-Life 2 Story came out and also released the same day as Counter-Strike Source, I would like to call this game a test by Valve to see the beautiful of VPhysics engine.

But still, this game is really worth for 5$ even if there's no much people playing it nowadays. The rules of the game is just simple:

""Join a server, fragging, have fun."""
2863,it's okay
2864,what
2865,"Why the fuck do I have 83 hours on this game. Like, I don't even know the answer to this question. How did this occur?"
2866,there is not better fun then throwing toilet at your best friend
2867,"I love half life and portal. so this might also be intresting too.
"
2868,it's alright just get a bot plugin/mod and the whole issue of there being few people becomes a minor problem rather than a major problem.
2869,☺
2870,"Back in the day, this game was the best. The fact that it was free if you have an NVIDIA/ATI graphics card gives this game a huge player base and bazillion hours of fun with other players. It's still good to play this today but don't expect much players playing this. Still a great game."
2871,One of my Fav games to play. What game can you play with a gravity gun throwing toilets and big metal thing at each other lol
2872,I wish more people would play this its really fun :(
2873,"HL2:DM has seen it's community rise and fall over the many long years that it has existed, from 2014 to present day, but just because it's graphics are old or it doesn't get updated by VALVe like TF2, Dota 2 ,or CS:GO, it doesn't mean that it is a bad game. HL2:DM still survives strong within the hearts of those who play it, and it still is fun even though the activities in the game are limited by the amount of servers. This game now relies on the community to make new content, and so far, that strategy has worked, making the game more fun than it originally was."
2874,"It was fun in the good old days, but the community is now dead. :("
2875,I could go to a strip club RIGHT NOW and spend money on a b l o w j o b  that is worth as much as this game. And it would be alot better.
2876,GREATs
2877,its good still is a classic to bad valve didnt treat it right
2878,its a multiplayer game get it if you have friends but you play video games how can you have friends
2879,"Your last resort when you're bored, and have more Hard Drive space."
2880,Totally worth it!!!! And the servers actaully have people on them!!!!!!!!
2881,"I love this game, but purchase Half Life 2 Episode 1 if you want it, since this is bundled with Episode 1. 
The community is very dead, but if you've got some buddies and you're willing to go through the port-forwarding and or can just do a lan party with this game, you'll be in for a nice time. Balance maybe isn't perfect, as some weapons are just significantly better than others, like the Crossbow, RPG, any of the explosives, or the AR2 orb, which just one shot you in most cases, and then the pistol, or the crowbar, which are incredibly situational, or the stunstick, which is just the crowbar but slower, and thus worse. But even in spite of all this, I have probably had some of the most fun gaming experiences in this game. If you're into Half Life 2, or just shooters, I'd reccomend the Half Life series in general, but if you're just looking for some multiplayer fun, and you're willing to go through the setup necessary to get a private server with your friends going, pick this game up. it's a real fun time."
2882,"That game is so great ! I actually had 100-200 hours at the other account I suggest that game 

10/10
8/8"
2883,"This Game is really fun and addictive And really challenging i play on Speedracerx servers.
"
2884,"Was good back in the day, feels in tune with the first HL deathmatch, lots of silly gameplay, got very frustrated at times and also LMFAO with some fo the outcomes in game. 
Very dated these days and few players online but was great for about the first 8 years after its release."
2885,hail gordon!
2886,Love the HL2  package. Bought Counter Strike back in 2005 after going to Microcenter to check out the fuss a guy at work made about Steam. Now 12 years later I've lost 3 wives and 10 jobs do to being so hooked. I miss all the old custom maps we use to play back then specifically maps on HL2 and CS Source.
2887,is good 10/7 would buy again
2888,"great game but it's dead,don't waste your 5$ on it right now"
2889,Very fun the gravity y gun makes it unquiqe over other shooters like Cs go or tfc
2890,"The most fun you can have on the internet, for $5 bucks"
2891,10/10
2892,11/10 game best game ever
2893,Nice mod..
2894,Great game.
2895,"There is no point in playing this today. I regret ever downloading. You run around with all the guns you get in the HL2 campaigns and shoot other players with no objective, it's like a dumbed-down version of arena shooters like Unreal Tournament, Quake, etc. However, Half Life Source Deathmatch is of historical significance, as some of the greatest ever multiplayer games, like TF2 and CS:GO, started off as mods of it. But like seriously, don't waste your time and go play those aforementioned shooters instead. TF2 is free and CS:GO is $15, that's great value."
2896,"Extremely fun when you actually find a game with people in it.
Never felt so OP in a Half Life game. 9/10

(It's only worth it if you get it in a bundle, if you're new to the Half Life universe, I advise you to buy a pack with most of the Half Life games)"
2897,Great game!
2898,Dead
2899,geed banter once you get into it... takes a while though!
2900,It's hard to find a server that has more than 10 people now. But still is fun when it works.
2901,"I love it! Although there's hardly anyone playing it nowadays, it's still super fun! It's worth the money. Try it!"
2902,7/10
2903,Came back to this game after 10 years.  I am in awe all over again in the beauty of the overall game and now even more so after seeing where players have taken it over the past years.
2904,This might be a dead game
2905,Great game not many people
2906,Half life 2 deathmatch is like every other deathmatch..its basically a cluster fk
2907,This is a very good game. But very few people play this game now.
2908,Love this game. I can recommend to anyone! <3
2909,Everything
2910,"Just good, dumb fun where you can throw caution to the side and enjoy Half-Life 2 in multiplayer.

Positives:
-Nobody is serious or having a go at you for playing badly
-Genuinely good source based  FPS
-As good quality as any Valve game ever.

Negatives:
Crossbow bolts can glitch when they hit ladders making the ladder unusable until the server resets.

Overall really fun game :D"
2911,Fairly fun game bringing Half-Life 2 into a multiplayer experience.
2912,Old but gold.
2913,My childhood... :3
2914,My fave game since 2004 ♥
2915,Good game
2916,die all the time LOL
2917,old game but its good
2918,"Good game unfortunately It is dead around 300 people playing this game for some reason some of them even  hacks in a server where there are hardly 5,6 people eventually all of them leave and the cheater masturbates solo with his cheat"
2919,"This is a great Arena Deathmatch game. Its very competitive, very good for settling a score when dueling across games with friends."
2920,"I've had this game for about as long as I have had steam and that's a long time. I would recommend this game to anyone.
"
2921,Great game
2922,"Half Life 2

If you don't have the Half Life 2 game, or any Half Life game for that matter, your missing the corner stone of the Valve Corporation, (aka STEAM).  The Valve Corporation is a video game developer and digital distribution company known for the Half-Life game and others such as Counter-Strike, and Team Fortress.  I was fortunate enough to obtain HL2 for free as a promotion of Steam at its infancy.  

HL2 reminds me allot of my old favourite UT game.  Way ahead of its time then.  As a FPS game, HL2 has some very wild and strange world maps.  The game physics are awesome, and the graphics for what is now considered an old game, are still amazing!  To truly enjoy the game, look into the history and trilogy of the characters and story line.

Beyond tournament mode, the game has plenty of community mods, and it offers something for everyone.  Some multiplayer servers have wonderfully modded roll playing games too.  Others, puzzles and coop modes.  To play one HL2 game mode on one server, is not enough. You would be missing out.  There are endless customization's of the base game and plenty of maps.  Some of the games you play today were probably based in some way off of Half Life.  I highly recommend this game, HL2, as part of your game library."
2923,it exists
2924,It would be REALLY fun... but its completely gohst town
2925,"Just bought to remind to good old days that i played this
So mutch good memories .

The game is awesome to play, if u dont want to spent mutch on a game , i advise u to buy this awesome game

You can play with your friend ,or with strangres, but dont worry becouse the community is awesome 😀"
2926,"A lot of people say the original is always better then the sqeual. I have to disagree. This is a game who does it right when they say ""Alright god dammit we're gonna make a second chapter of this game and where gonna do it right!"". There is so much to say about this game, the massive cult following it's gain to it's various RP servers it's spun off in GMOD. It's massive amount of lore to it's amazing combat system. It's nothing but amazing! There is so much to learn, so much to enjoy, so much to love! I know I sound like I'm kissing ♥♥♥ when I say this but this game makes me love valve more than anything. Either being the same badass scientist that crawled his way out of that hell hole known as Black Mesa smashing Crowbars into the ugly guls of Alien Monsters now into the Gasmask of Metro Police Officers that opress a civilian populace under a Universal Union Banner in the name of ""Civil Status"". Or riding around in a scrapped sports car with a rather attractive but at the same time a TRUE strong and independant female character Alyx. You feel like a badass actually doing something for a resistance, no, a revolution for mankind being enslaved by a Alien Empire. This game is perfect. This game is art."
2927,good game
2928,HL2 Deathmatch. was one of the first games ever on my steam. I played it all day when i came home from school and had so much fun in it. The PVP is some cancer Call of duty kind of shit. but the main Coop maps and Puzzel maps are alot of fun. They can sometimes bring out the Friendship and Teamwork in ppl and if you get bored there is allways the CityRP maps. there kinda like the dirty cheap version of Gmod DarkRP.
2929,"Really nice game. I only joined one server but it was lots of fun. Differently from other more popular games where the community is complete shit everyone in the server I joined was very helpful and there was no ear rape at all. Completely recommend, even if it is probably going to die in a few years."
2930,"Back in the old times as it is quickiest way to express myself - this game was one of those must play games - with friends.

Like someone once said: Where else you can bash your friends with toilet bowl? But it is still all about the players, game game is really fun when you know who you are playing with!

Great with bunch of friends on enclosed servers."
2931,nice game i like it
2932,"Although it's pretty sparsely populated, it's still a pretty fun game to play.

"
2933,SAD
2934,"All of the Half Life games are some of the best games made. I wish developers would follow Valve's lead and make games that are this engaging. Valve's games are some of the highest quality, most visually stunning, superb story and gameplay available."
2935,it suxs and got it 4 free cuntz
2936,best and original game ever made!
2937,"The times I had with this game and people playing it...


Sadly it's kinda dying but there is still couple servers which are barely alive. This game used to have the BEST community ever. We will see eachother in HL3:DM again lads! (If I don't die in old age before that...)

"
2938,Fun!
2939,people still play this shit
2940,A gmod gamemode outside of gmod? dafuq.
2941,10/10 would play StarGate in HalfLife again.
2942,"I don't really like these Half life deathmatch games because all it is, is a PVP of Half life."
2943,"There are a handful of community-run groups that still play HL2: DM. Outside of these, there are occasional private games. That's it. Unfortunately, this is a great game, but a dead game. I want so badly to give this a thumbs up, but with the state of the game, I can't."
2944,"Game is good, but no one really plays besides long-time old-school players who've played since it came out."
2945,"Well I bought the game back during the Autumn sale in November 2016!!!
I only had a good $3 from selling items on the community market.
When I first played it and opened up a lobby my expectations were pretty low but let me tell u something:

IT WAS MUCH DIFFERENT THAN WHAT I EXPECTED

I expected to just play the game for a few minutes and think it was cool then refund it to get my money back but instead
I sold more items so I could buy it for a friend.

Personally, I can see why this game was very popular back in the day because one of the cons of this game is its very hard to find a good deathmatch server.

The people who still play it had 12 YEARS to find out every technique to top fragging.

I would also think that this game can be considered a very cheap version of Garry's Mod since it has RP even though I only know of one RP server that is still popular,

So overall I'd give this game a good 8/10 because it has a lot of potential to become a popular Multiplayer Shooter again but since valve doesn't update their games I wouldn't see that happening soon unless a miracle pops up idk. The point is its a good game but the community is close together but most of the servers are dead so you have to favorite all of the good servers to have a great experience."
2946,"HALF LIFE 2: Deathmatch

+Massive Fun with friends
+A great LAN party game
+Runs on nearly any computer
+Hours of fun

-Online servers are empty
-Not much variety without mods

= A good game for LAN parties and playing online with friends, but if you don't have friends who play this game, and if you can't convince them to get it, it's not worth it, if you want similar online experiences, I recommend Gary's Mod."
2947,"Set in the universe of the Half-Life series, this game is one of the best deathmatch. It's a challenging game and it's a good option for competitive gaming. Its community has been reducing in number of members with the years but a group of old school's players revive it occasionally."
2948,Game gets really boring after a while
2949,Still
2950," See Valve, it's not that hard to make a fun game. Add online multiplayer, give some guns to your character, make some awesome maps, and then let it go. Now Valve is about ""Complex"" and making things more ""Modern"". Modern games suck, man. Back then it wasn't about reaching Global or getting to master prestige. Everybody just hopped on and had fun, no ranking.

 9.5/10 Strong FPS"
2951,It's fun to play online c:
2952,Half-Life my favorite game
2953,Good
2954,"Great for Party and Killing TIme,I think this game need a [h1] Reboot [/h1]"
2955,"""Have a seat,"" ""you are being monitored."" ""Let that sink in."""
2956,Needs more people. Extremely fun though
2957,"Game has given me over 10 years of love. Done almost everything there is to do in this game as far as pub play, competitive play, built and played mods such as capture the flag, pro mod, gungame mods, ran servers, installed server mods and plugins, created maps and more. There is so much this game has to offer, it is sad that the developers never gave it the time of day, but even without the support it still found a way to many peoples hearts."
2958,"DO you like playing over the internet with the Russian empire? 

Then buy this."
2959,"Probably the most underestimated game. After many years it's still playable. For example, there are a lot of North-American and European servers where you can find quite friendly community. However, hl2dm can be difficult for new players because there are many players with incredible playing skills such as ggun-tricks, bhoping and more. Well-experienced players usually play at match-servers, but sometimes you can meet them at standart public servers as well. It's nice to realize that this game is still alive although many years have passed. I recommend this game."
2960,i lovethis game combat stradegy and every one plays it but..............i mean wheres half life 3 ||| three i ussualy create LAN maps for freinds or play lokis play house but its getting lifeless still best game ofall TIME
2961,A classic Quack like game with still a lot of servers and player even thou the game is old as earth.
2962,"[h1]Half-Life 2: Deathmatch - The game that was forgotten.[/h1]

The game is a simple port from HL2. Valve never cared for it and updated it only a few times which made it even less responsive. There are many thing left unfixed and broken such as -
[list]
[*] Buggy hitboxes
[*] Lag making hitboxes be where they should be not
[*] Not working properly shotgun
[*] Bad spectator mode
[*] Players having the opportunity to change their rates
[/list]

Of course some of those problems have been fixed by the community but not all servers are the same. Still i have played this game and loved doing so. I recommend you to play it if you really want to see what it's like even tho there aren't many players left. The reason for that is the lack of support from Valve. 

The game hasn't changed since its release and that's why it can't offer the veteran players anything new. The only way for them to play competitively is through 3rd party websites and forums. The money rewards are even sometimes non-existent and so on. 

Therefore don't buy it because you will be disappointed if you had high hopes."
2963,"Was fun

2968,There isn't much except deathmatching and it's a blast.
2969,Pro players never shoot once. Grav gun abuse.
2970,"Half-Life 2: Deathmatch brings back the adrenaline pumped feeling from old Deathmatch classics such as Unreal tournament and Quake. With improved graphics, physics and a combination of the half-life 2 story this game is filled with rush. Equip your gravity gun and throw a toilet at the enemy, the amount of props will get annoying though since they are in your way."
2971,ass becasue of the hackers. or maybe i'm just ass
2972,hell yea
2973,The fastest multiplayer game i ever see!
2974,Great game for new and ventren players
2975,Very good game
2976,"Graphically, it’s no exaggeration to say that Half-Life 2 is the best looking game I’ve ever seen, making even Halo 2 look ordinary."
2977,Rekking noobs since 2009
2978,Very fun game but it is hard to find a server with players and if you do find a server with players there is high chance to have lag.
2979,"It's fine I suppose but Unreal Tournament was already well old by the time this game came out. And it seems I'm not the only one who thinks so, as there are only about ten servers up at the moment."
2980,THIS GAME IS SO INTENSE AND I LOVE IT. 11/10 ME
2981,"As good as it was on the 1st day. There are still servers for both new ones and pro ones. This game will never die.

P.S.: ""HL3 confirmed"" will come brothers and sisters. The hope will never die. Aie!"

Half Life 2 Deathmatch is a multiplayer add on for Half Life 2, but it's very similar to every early MP attempt Valve have made. 

I haven't played much of this game due to the simple fact that this game is completely dead. I played a few rounds of deathmatch but that was it.

Recently I wanted to play a bit more, but all servers were empty so getting into a game was next to impossible.

I'm guessing since it's like every valve MP game that's dying or dead, there's a ton of community events or people that  play it all the time.

I can't recommend this game due to the fact that it's completely dead, so there's no reason to play it. 

Final Rating:
3/10

Pros:
+ Seems fun

Cons:
- Completely Dead

2991,the crossbow is the greater god
2992,"This game is mostly recommended to those people who wish to begin their journey in death-match (dm) type of gameplays. This is because it is one of the most basic FPP shooter type game, although there are weapons existing in this game you were never aware of, but thats where you explore the game right? :)
This particular game proved to be beneficial to me as it developed my control over other FPP or TPP games, it really improved my shooting skill actually. 
There are a bunch of servers that provide different kinds of dm experience.....there are the most basic public team dm servers, co-op servers that give survival as well as seek and kill kind of experience and the VG servers (virtuos gamers).
The VG servers are totally inclined towards professional, yet a fun seeking gameplay. So, if you happen to like the game so much that you wish to go to a competitive level...VG servers are recommended to you to train yourselves.
Thats not it! There are even jump servers, movements servers, aim practice servers, etc. Servers that allow you to learn as well as practice with others(or alone), the most important movements and jumping styles in the game.
There are glitches/bugs in this game, no one ever said no...but you can even use them to your advantage!
However, to know and use these glitches/bugs...dear reader, you gotta get this game!
Lastly, i would like to say that this game holds lots and literally...lots of opportunities to improve and enjoy yourselves...i have been playing it for over 2 years now..and i still discover newer things in different servers, and with different other players. 
(Just for your knowledge, FPP-- First Person Perspective and TPP--Third Person Perspective)

Now, what are you waiting for?"
2993,"probably the first online shooter that redefined the gaming physics of modern multiplayer shooters.
Loved it, love it, and i will still come back to it everytime i want to relive Valve's glorious debuts."
2994,"5/5
"
2995,A++
2996,gg
2997," only tried this out shortly so do not put my thumbs down in too heavy of a vote. 

The problem I had during my game was the lack of games with players and the fact that online multiplayers like this do not age well. If you need more ingoing description then I suggest looking at more reviews but would you really buy an old online multiplayer game?"

3020,where it all started
3021,"Funny to play with friends and strangers
guns are amazing
servers are fun
friendly community 
Ok graphics
Bombs and explosives
People flying when hit by bombs
Amazing fan base

Flaws
Bit buggy
Some hackers with cheecky god mod
Can't find my favourite server (gravity gun) seems to be removed"
3022,"Actually one of the funnest games and definitely one of my favorite games, always outrageously fun and you can still find healthily populated servers"
3023,"I like the idea of an official HL2 multiplayer game, but the gunplay in Deathmatch sucks. 

You might as well try to fart in your enemies' general direction, because your normal guns only fire milk duds for bullets, while the other weapons can just blenderize you like it's nobody's bussiness.
It's pretty much the most campable game in existence, if someone gets to a weapons drop before you do, then that's pretty much game over. The items spawn in the same spot every ten seconds, which can make your spawn camper become immortal cancer, now doesn't that sound fun to play against throughout the whole match?

I recommend you play this mess with friends for the best experience. If you play casually, considering that you'll ever find a match with a decent amount of players, then prepare to have your balls chopped off."
3024,"Very fun, community-supported game. If more people played this fast-paced quake/HL2 hybrid, the world would be better."
3025,Very good game
3026,"nice game,still like it 0_0"
3027,this is frickin crazy fam
3028,This game was the game that started it all for me. I met some of the best people playing this and also met my husband!!!

3039,"Fun, i guess"
3040,Best multiplayer ever

3042,It's OK
3043,"Half Life ' Deathmatch !
İts good shit"
3044,Excellent. One of my all time favorites games. Wish they would continue the series. To master the game... learn how to move - determine which weapon is appropriate for the map... and learn the maps.
3045,Why can't you press E to pick up props?
3046,"I like this game for it's gameplay, which is really funny in many ways because tossing a toliet at people is really fun! XD Also can there be an update to get rid of bhoping for all valve games because that crap is a problem in this game."
3047,This game is fantastic! Great for making friends and for competitive fun : )
3048,gg
3049,dont.
3050,I like so mush this game
3051,Simple : Best game ever made in this universe !!!!!!!!
3052,After some thought this game could be great if more people played this instead of just pros who have played the game since launch.
3053,"Pros:

-Memorable, exotic, and creative maps the community and Valve has to offer
-It's HL2, what can you say?
-Source engine is in it, which gives you a diverse of ways to kill an enemy.
-It's easy and fast to play. 
-There's no bullshit tutorials, so you can get straight into the game without any problem. 

Cons:

-Bullshit, how did i get killed by him when i just respawned?
-Not a lot of active servers in it to play, unless you find servers outside the U.S, which i tend to do find.
-Colt Python and Resistance Crossbow are OP to the limit. 
 
Overall:

This game is just perfect for any HL2 fan, espcially me, myself."
3054,"Top worth it, funny moments and awesome killstreaks ^^ Hahaha i can't stop it since its so funny"
3055,"Half-Life 2: Deathmatch — многопользовательский шутер от первого лица.

Why i like this :

3067,"I'd be recommending it if it wasn't for the following:

[olist]
    [*]The 2010 Orange Box update that ruined the game for most of us, resulting in many leaving the game. Most techniques were simply not working anymore.
    [*]The SteamPipe update deleted my files in the <username> folder. Lost a lot of work.
    [*]The community. This has to be a problem. Some servers are really good, with a good community, but what destroyed the game is the russians. I'm not going to put a capital letter on it because they're not worth it. They cheat themselves and ban legit players (like me for example), who are accused of cheating. All that's happening is that they want to monopolize the game. Stay away from match servers hosted from russians. Sometimes, when fragging them in public, they are going to ask you for a 1on1 just to prove themselves, just ignore them.
[*] Cheaters. There is a cheat going on, ruining everybody's fun. Until this is fixed, stay away from DM servers.

3068,I like it =D

3070,"Do you only have 4hp left and theres 5 enemies in the next room? Think it would be wise to find a medkit? Don't care, going to rush in anyway"
3071,i did not play this game for much hours but i remember getting this and HL2 lost coast off some steam website and playing the hell out of it the few days before i got GMOD. good times. all i remember is the amount of crazy maps and the community was just great.

3074,"In case you kept up with the story mode of this game series, you don't need to read any further, because you know this game has the physics, graphics, playability and arsenal way ahead of its time, bringing you moments of fun and a rush of adrenaline.

has too much lag during the game 
did'nt like it at all"
3077,"[h1] Great game [/h1]
i love this game 
this game will not become boring even if you play it 400 times
the bad side i players dont play it 
I'd like if valve will do a remake of this game
9/10"
3078,"AMAZING for 1v1s or playing with friends. Some people still play, but it is mostly dead now"
3079,Got it for 79p on sale. It's absolute chaos but it's so much fun. Definetly worth purchasing if you've got the money.
3080,I don't remember buying this game
3081,this game is great when you just want to  shoot something
3082,i would rather buy winrar
3083,Really addictive
3084,"yer you have heard about half life and half life 2 iff you are to 

    deathmatch this is the game for you try it iff you like action
 
ofc but i have played for over 2000 hours and i still play it is a very good game and the 

deathmatch is even better if you like shooting games"
3085,"Oh man, the memories..

This game was a childhood memory, I'm now writing this as an 18 year old, but, I remember being in grade school, I had to of been maybe 6 or 7 years old and I went to my best friends house and he showed me Counter-Strike, Day of Defeat, and Half-Life 2: Deathmatch.. I remember us taking turns playing this game to the point of where I ended up begging my dad to buy me it and make me a steam account.. the memories I have within this game are some of the best in my entire life.

Looking back on this game, it was fun in all aspects; makes me really sad to see the games that come out nowadays aren't nearly as fun as they used to be.. Hopefully one day Valve will make Half-Life 3 and a Half-Life 3: Deathmatch will come with it, until then.. Rest in Peace my sweet prince."
3086,Jitters...Jitters....Blah....Jitters. I dont understand. It only seems to happen in valve games. High fps low latency and completely unplayable. Very strange.
3087,GGGGGGGGGGOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOODDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD
3088,My life.
3089,A great multiplayer deathmatch with a Half-Life 2 theme.
3090,"oyuna bence trainer eklenmeli oyuncular istediğini ala bilmeli
"
3091,yes
3092,"This game is very fun and underated. Get 4+ friends to play this or else you will verse people with over 5000 hours in the game and over 9000 ping for you. 

If you have played half life 2 and enjoyed it then this game is great fun."
3093,"this game is shit 
nobody plays it anymore"
3094,"Words cannot describe the glory once HL2:DM had once bestowed upon us.
It is dying, but is still incredible. I think this calls for a reboot."
3095,I was hoping for fun but full of hackers.. Hackssss. Between Running through walls and 1 shot kills. not worth it.
3096,"I can't say I would play it for more than an hour, but it's fun."
3097,good
3098,"Multi-player arena, based on Half-life 2 backgrounds, skins, and weaponry. It used to be fun - right after HL2 hit the shelves - but now, it's all quite boring, unless you have some tradition to meet up and make fun with friends there.

The community is vanishing - most of all servers are empty 4life. And even while there are still some people playing, if you haven't got there until now - then you can easily forget about this issue forever.

What's good about HL2 Deathmatch - is all about physics and gravy-gun, and the ability to flood the server with multiple Freemans running around. Or cooperative maps, where you fight through some location filled with respawning monsters, hoping on the backup from the rest of your team.

And now comes the bad part. For one, there are no (absolute zero) chances to find yourself a good team. There are no skilled players, as there are no applications for their skills. The weaponry, that was so good in the single-player, isn't really any good for multiplayer arena FPS. That means totally random gameplay. You can die every second, or dominate with dozens of kills - it's not matter anything.

So no, if you're not having some friends who will play with you there, I don't recommend starting this one. Other Valve products, like Counter-Strike and Team Fortress, are much more capable to entertain and provide decent gameplay.

Mark 5/10. Engine's good, the game at this point - not."
3099,"I remember first playing this game about 8 years ago.  I went under the name ""Sharp-Shooter"" at the time, and it was my first experience playing an FPS with other players.  Unfortunately, that experience would turn out to be a bad one.

Many of the weapons in this game require little to no skill to use, or have a secondary fire that requires no skill.  With many of them, you can be very vague with your aiming and yet be rewarded with ridiculous damage (usually an instant kill at full health).  An example of this would be the secondary fire for the pulse rifle.  Anyone who has played singleplayer Half Life 2 knows that this is a fairly large orb that rebounds off of all surfaces and instant kills any target it hits regardless of current health.  Well, in Deathmatch it is no different, but this is a problem for two reasons.  The first being that there are other weapons, such as the primary fire for both the SMG and pulse rifle, which have been nerfed considerably in this game compared to the campaign game.  The reduced damage meant that you had to keep your aim on target at all times for the best effect which requires concentration and practice.  The orbs having no reduction of any kind therefore makes this unfair as anyone could take down someone skilled at using the primary fire with no effort at all.  The second is that the orb's ability to rebound everywhere means that there is little chance of avoiding it, and the user could get kills without so much as seeing their targets, or even knowing where they were at the time.

But that's just one example.  And yet the majority of the community somehow convinces itself that every weapon in this game is equally as hard to use as everything else.

So do I recommend this game?  Well, not really.  If you are looking for a fair and skill-based game, this is not for you.  It forces you to play in a way that requires no effort,  which if you refuse to do as I did, will leave you with the stress of losing constantly regardless of how hard you try or how skilled you are.  Then again, like with anything, it is still up to you."
3100,Alot of people on this game know their shit and will do the thing where they lob a nade and switch to graf gun and fuck your shit up soon after. Fucks with my brain but damn i get raped.
3101,"Old ,good HL2DM..."
3102,RPs don't have 10 year olds whining and bitching unlike GMOD.
3103,"Even though I reccommend this game, I can't really say to buy it. Don't get me wrong, this game gives you one hell of an entertaining time, killing people with saw blades and toilets. The problem is this game has really died down over the years. There are servers with bots, but you're lucky to find players. This game has a small, but active, community, one that has really depleted since this games release. The fact is this game is made for multiplayer, bots don't just cut it for me.

That being said, pick it up when it's on sale, hunt for some servers and hopefully find a game. The community is small, but the players are there. You will find a few half-full severs, but the game really is scarce since Valve stopped supporting it. This game is a laugh, buy it when it's cheap is my best advice."
3104,There is no vanilla servers these days :c
3105,gud
3106,"very good game i recommend gravity gun only servers
"
3107,"A nice little game! Based off of the Half-Life 2 universe (obviously). Pretty nice mechanics, and perhaps the least toxic FPS community I've seen yet. Sadly, barely any servers are populated. Most of the servers which are populated have like 999999999999 sound downloads soooo..."
3108,Good
3109,"Basicaly you are a bullet sponge in a bullet hell

I have nothing more to say..."
3110,"This game is amazing
-nonstop fun
-full on mayhem
-stress relief
-It's a source engine game so it can play on a toaster
For $5.00 you cannot beat the price"
3111,"Fun game to go around and shoot each other without tactical thinking, 
don't try to save ammo or hide. They will hunt you down no matter what."
3112,Kinda dead but worth playing it.
3113,Good game if you like the type of shooting games.
3114,i like how it says toss a toliet at your friend today
3115,"Half-Life 2 Deathmatch is the official multiplayer component to Half-Life 2. It released about two weeks after the singleplayer and is stand-alone. It is the successor to the immensely popular and addictive multiplayer to the original game. Although it didn't have the same legacy and lasting appeal as it. 

The game includes two multiplayer gamemodes. Deathmatch and Team Deathmatch. Along with a handful of multiplayer maps that were portions of the singleplayer. When I first played Half-Life 2 Deathmatch I remember being a little disappointed since it lacked content and felt like a bit of an afterthought compared to other games at the time like Counter Strike Source and Unreal Tournament 2004. 

Indeed the game is mostly known for being full of hackers. Which is unfortunate since it did improve after release with mods like CTF. Half-Life 2 Deathmatch's legacy is now seen in the modifications that were based upon it, like Garry's Mod. If you want to play it today I'd suggest downloading a mod for bots and a few custom maps. It's a relic today, but a playable one. And at 5$ it does give you what you paid for. Nothing more, and nothing less."
3116,My first game tournament was in this game..
3117,"mano, half life 2 é bom, mas o deathmatch dele além de eu achar meio zoado o fato de vir separado do jogo original eu sinceramente não gostei, o do primeiro jogo é bem melhor (da versão clássica porque a do source também é outro erro da valve)"
3118,Det här spelet är faktiskt genuint roligt har jag för mig det får fan en rätt seriös review inte för att någon nånsin läser all skit jag skriver förutom kanske theo nån gång men det här är game of the century
3119,Great FPS
3120,This is a deathmatch mod for Half-Life 2 from 2004. It has very dated FPS mechanics (obviously) and the servers are now empty.
3121,"Best fun with props and bolts. Set traps all day .

3122,Even Jonestown is more alive than this game.
3123,"Like Skyrim but Multiplayer
"
3124,So I got this product as a bundle with day of defeat soutce and trust me it can't get more arcade than this the gameplay is fast and easy the community is growing and being an fps player for over a decade I can say this game is one of the most fun games for casual people
3125,"I'm Rick Harrison, and this is my pawn shop. I work here with my old man and my son, Big Hoss. Everything in here has a story and a price. One thing I've learned after 21 years - you never know what is gonna come through that door."

Also, the gameplay quickly gets boring.

Buy GMOD instead."
3127,bought this game for no reason
3128,"This game is tons of fun and deserves to be in your steam library. You will not play it as much if you dont have friend to play it with so i recommend getting the orange box or the valve complete pack but the valve complete pack is really expensive. 

so i give this game a 7-8/10."
3129,"Great game, fun to play with friends, however there's bound to be people with quite a bit of skill, while it's just HL2 weapons, it's a very simple game with nice maps. worth the money if you're bored and other friends have it."

3131,"GG!  loads of fun, not slow but mid low game range an oldie but a classic Steam."
3132,"This is fast gameplay DeathMatch/TeamDeathMatch game in which you fight as 2 fractions from Half Life Universe which are Rebels and Combine your mission is to kill as many enemies as you can and just have fun and of course you will hve most of HL2 weapons such as RPG,AR2 and many many more... This game isn't about tactics it's about fast reaction ,speed and quick thinking.In this game your'e supposed to be the best on the server nut you know do what you want in it."
3133,This is a hold up!!!LOL
3134,"You know, it's not the best Deathmatch out there, but it's interesting to play through the eyes of a Combine Soldier or a Rebel. 

8.6/10"

3139,"(English)
This game is divine, because after TF it looks like a masterpiece, the same Half Life 2, but the players are fun to play and the players there are very good bunch of mess happens during the fight, they don't even write in chat, but this game forever.

Эта игра божественна, ибо после тф она смотрится, как шедевр, тот самый Half Life 2, но с игроками, с ними весело играть и игроки там очень хорошие, куча месива происходит во время боя, они даже не пишут в чат, но эта игра на веки."
3140,"An amazing community where every person knows each other. 
12 years really allows for time to filter out the shitters.

Roleplay is clearly why this game is still even remotely alive."
3141,"Fun game for little money.
10\10"
3142,"Such a shame no one plays this game, as it's a lot of fun, that is if you can actually find a server."
3143,Greeeeat game. Idk why people dont play it anymore but you can always find servers that contain lots of different gamemodes. This is a great game if you want a break from cs:go or etc because of the fast gameplay and the maps included or downloaded from comunitty servers. Also for some unknown reason i got it for free so meh...
3144,Not the most fun multiplayer experience for me.
3145,I can now achieve my dream of killing people with toilets
3146,fun to cheat in
3147,"Half-Life 2: Deathmatch is a Valve shooter and as far as I can tell it's one of the last ones. It has the friendly fun community, the fast and exciting gameplay, that doesn't get old, and a massive amount of community created content that Valve should really look for. 
    

         But [strike] Half-Lif [/strike] HL2DM is a relic from a bygone era. Valve is through with making games like this, but the old hunk of junk is still running well. For all we know Valve may never make a game again. But it's an old-school Valve shooter. 

               And that's pretty damn good."

Deathmatch is timeless in a lot of ways. The weapons, maps, and interface are honed to perfection and i always enjoy playing. 
As long as you can find a hack and cheat free server, you never end up with the typical ""call of duty syndrome"" where it takes 12 headshots to take down an enamy but they get you with one shot.
While there are a few bugs and servers are starting to dwindle, I thoroughly enjoy this game."
3156,"It's old, but still very good. the community is awesome and welcoming too. I suggest you get it while it's still around."
3157,boobs
3158,Literally my favorite game of all time. It's the only game ive been playing for 9 years. It's so open ended and the gaming community around it is one of the best. I trust and belive that Half Life 3 will one day exist.
3159,"Played the game for a few hours,
Still no idea whats going on...

[b]by KTMboyz[/b]

[i]""Oh my god, so fun!""[/i]

Yes!  This is what I needed!  What more could you ask for?  It's Half-Life 2 but Multiplayer!  Seriously!  Half-Life 2 is my favourite FPS game of all time for many reasons, (see my Half-Life 2 review for why) so let me play with friends and you have yourself a hit.  Sadly, the game is dead and there are barely any players at all.  That's the only reason I don't recommend the game.  Although, I'm sure you'll find one server that has people on it and trust me, you'll have a blast!  I feel terrible that I haven't discovered this earlier...  Anyway, I would get it on sale, just because you don't wanna waste money on a game that currently doesn't have alot of players.  It's more fun than most shooters today and is something I feel you'll always come back to!

[h1]9.2/10[/h1]"
3168,"Game made in 2004, Orginaly from Half-life 2
12 Years later, Servers are still Populated
I'd say this game is Pretty ''Dank''"
3169,Good bit of fun with the Half Life 2 weapons.
3170,gordon freeman socializes
3171,grav gun only
3172,"As a bad rat fan I recommend this game
"
3173,STILL ALIVE!!!!!!
3174,"The game is alive. Not much, but still alive. There are some Players and enough servers to select. On some servers there are good bots. The game is fast and fun. If you dont have much time or you just want to run and shoot, buy this. Community is not toxic either. Everyone plays for fun. Its a simple but nice game: You spawn, run, kill, die, respawn and then the same over again. IMO better and more fun than most AAA titles. It runs nice, its not bad optimized, you wont have problems.

Its worth the money."
3175,"Dead game, barely any servers and if there is one, you'll be stuck with 300 ping or higher."
3176,"This game is nothing dull or not-fun. It's really fun actually. This game is a DeathMatch that uses hl2 models and weapons only, it means no counter strike weapons, only half life2. It uses some maps that I haven't seen in half life, still it makes it even better. This game is really fun. 8/10, would play again."
3177,10/10 would throw a toilet at a combine again.
3178,Pretty gud 12/10
3179,"This game is one of the best FPS's evermade.

Really hard to get into if you want to become decent at it, but that's whats fun about it, it's really hard to get good at but at the same time fun. The only problem is that the game is basically dead and no one plays it anymore, it was way more active 2011 than it is now. Some servers are good but others aren't because they dont allow the skills that comes with this game such as Bhopping, knowing spawns, gravity-gun tricks and other stuff. Im pointing my finger at you JKAL.

Solid game that sadly has been abandoned by people.

One of my all time favorite FPS's with in-depth mechanics which takes hours to master.

Score 9,5/10 

Worth every penny."
3180,Good
3181,Barebones multiplayer.
3182,10/10 killed a player with a toilet
3183,Fast multiplayer action set in the Half-Life 2 universe! HL2's physics adds a new dimension to deathmatch play. Play straight deathmatch or try Combine vs. Resistance teamplay. Toss a toilet at your friend today

3196,"  What can I possibly say that hasn't been said abouth HL2: Deathmatch? It's all good, classic, old-style shoot-everything arena style fun. Though I must say it does tend to drag after about an hour or so playing straight.

 If you're gonna get this game, make sure you either find a good server or some friends to play it with because sadly this little gem probably ha slittle online life left. Whenever I get on, more than half the servers have nobody on them and another 1/3rd is way too customized or geared towards veteran players.

 Provided you can get some people to play with, this game is awesome. Throwing toilets at your friend's heads at 80 miles an hour has never been so fun. It's cheap and definitely worth the price- get it of you have some minor cash lying around, during a neat sale or just getting the whole damn Valve pack!"
3197,"This game is very good and addictive. Suprisingly for me, I'm better than most people!"
3198,Fishing/grapple servers for days.
3199,AKA Half-Life 2: WHAT IS HAPPENING AHMHMSHHGDHASA... Fun game though! Adding physics to Half-Life 1: Deathmatch is like adding peanut butter to a jam sandwich.

3202,lost interest pretty fast just like VALVE LOST INTEREST IN MAKING ACTUAL GAMES ESPECIALLY HALF LIFE 3 or EPISODE 3 WHAT EVER...................
3203,I need a life . . . or half of one
3204,"How did this happen? How come this terrible game became a multiplayer? Well, this game is terrible, lets call it... a ""sandbox"", or no... wait... lets call it - a dumpster - you play with trash all you want, s h i t t y weapons, s h i t t y ragdolls (don't make too many ragdolls, this will lag as hell). Obviously - no bots, because its a half life game, who needs bots, right? Play against r e t a r d e d kids, which are admins, so remember! - don't swear at all or even if its for good reasons - you'll be happily kicked for trying to be a normal person. The game itself is not that bad...     Just kidding - its terrible, the weapon balancing is just s h i t (half life 2 singleplayer wasn't any better),  the animations are so rigid, i fell like im playing against some bots who pay like c u n t s, but the truth is even worse - those are real c u n t s. Do NOT attempt to play this game - you'll get disappointed as much as with half life 2, since all this game is, is just simple hl2 garbage with multiplayer functions - nothing else. You love terrible games? Then this game was created just so you can play this terrible game with your friends! Enjoy the cancer together!"
3205,"A close to extinct gamemode. Many memories, but no recommandation."
3206,Very Nice Game
3207,Like the Classic Deathmatch from the first one!
3208,somewhat dead community but still a great game if you can find players
3209,No-one plays this shit anymore 2: Deathmatch
3210,"I think this game is really cool and addicting, because i love being able to play an actual team deathmatch game with half life weapons and tactics, like getting a barrel with the gravrity gun to stop gunfire from the enemies and then just launch it at them. The only problem about the game is the matchmaking system, you have to keep scrolling down servers until you actually find one with people and little ping, but once you are in a server, you are guaranteed to have fun."
3211,"Thought for sure no one is still playing this.  Boy was I wrong.  The game is litterally nothing but trolls and noobs now.  It is basically one giant battle, between the team that is cornered and the team that captured the area with the rocket launchers.

You should know how stupid this game is before you get it.  However when I played it I was one of the trolls, so I loved it!"
3212,"Simple, straightforward deathmatching with Half-Life 2 weapons. Unremarkable on its own, but the basis for many, many a mod, and an icon of an era when higher health pools mattered."
3213,wogo-life2 death match
3214,"Half-Life 2: Deathmatch. Physics can be really silly, but there are great communities- both veteran and new, various aspects to open source benefits, and much fun to be had.

3215,"[u][b]-Quick Review-[/b][/u]
Half-Life 2: Deathmatch is basically Half-Life 2 multiplayer, with custom made maps in Source SDK and a few members within the community still playing.

[u][b]-Detailed breakdown review-[/b][/u]
[b]Story:[/b] Now, this is the story all about how. Atratzu life got flipped-turned upside down. And I'd like to take a minute, just sit right there. I'll tell you how I became a red splat on the side of the wall.

Half-Life 2: Deathmatch suddenly appeared in my steam library, I believe it was recently added to a bundle that I've purchased (specifically, with my past purchase of Half-Life 2: Episode One). Half-Life 2: Deathmatch used to be a very large FPS community which started after the huge success of the Half-Life 2 series. But because Half-Life 2 is only single player, the community asked for a multiplayer competitive game, and valve delivered.
http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=701298322

[b]Gameplay:[/b] Half-Life 2: Deathmatch, controls EXACTLY like Half-Life 2. Which honestly I always thought I would be alright at a Half-Life multiplayer FPS, but it's been a long time since I played through all the Half-Life 2 games, so my skills were quite rusty.
You have the same weapons, but the maps/servers are customized. I joined and played a Free for all, and a team death match. There is still several active people playing the game, at the end of one game people were actually congratulating the person who got first!
I'm not sure if it's because so few play the game that they're all a tighter knit group, or I just found the one small patch in space time where people are still friendly, but it was nice to actually play a few rounds with some people who aren't screaming little kids swearing and speaking profanities they cannot comprehend.
http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=701298307

[b]Conclusion:[/b] To be completely honest, I haven't been on a FPS craze for a long time, the game has aged the same way as Half-Life 2. If you ever wanted to play a multiplayer FPS of Half-Life 2 there are plenty of servers, many are empty, you could even figure out the technical know-how to set up your own server and own maps.
http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=701298347

I actually probably have used source SDK more then Half-Life 2: Death Match. It's a shame to see a community shrink so much, but props to those of you who keep playing one of your favorite games, don't change and keep on shooting!"

3218,"It's the multiplayer DM version of HL2, with every HL2 weapon + the CP stunstick. This game is one of the few Valve multiplayer games without a toxic playerbase."

3220,abandon all hope. this game is dead.

3243,dead game is dead
3244,"This was probably my first game ever on Steam, after doing the whole Half Life series. Downloading this to see if the servers are still up. Hope they are, I had so many memories of this grinding it out with teams 10 years ago and totally ""pwning"" noobs."

3253,"This game,,.. was my first game on steam, other than the Half Life 2 Demo, way back in 2009.
Good times of killbox servers, spamming classico (tenacious D) in chat, blowing myself up trying to grenade jump and rocket jump, finding a server with a good map rotation and regular players, and yes, throwing a toilet at my friend.
Definately my first source game and the best.  Played it for years, it's still so fun.
Totally Reccommended.  And those who got it free received a real gem of a multiplayer game."
3254,Absolutely Brilliant action. Playable with bots so no worries with dying servers. The game itself is a reminder of how the simple multiplayer games of then can outshine those of now. Best speed of fps action. Buy it with the half life complete pack.

3261,This is the only FPS I'm good at. I'm forced to recommend it.
3262,"The very first game that I played on Steam. It brings back many memories of learning how to play fps games on PC and introduced me to VALVE in general. I promptly got the VALVE Complete Pack and have loved all of their games since.

This game is litterally just HL2 but instead of playing through a story, you play as a rebel or combine, and fight the other faction. It is simply a Deathmatch game, but there is team deathmatch. All the hours I have put into it were mostly from long ago, but every time I launched the game I had fun with friends, and even made some new ones. I have no idea how popular it is now, but if you still have a group of friends that like to play it you can host your own server and play, or even find one of the empty ones to join."
3263,More dead than the soldiers in 'Nam.
3264,Good ol' Deathmatch
3265,Great game though I find it a bit odd how the system requirements are missing Linux/SteamOS despite being fully compatiable.

only reason you should ever play this game is because you're trapped at your nans with a netbook and don't own Counterstrike 1.6.

Personally I'm going to stick to HL2 for it's single player and remember it as that."
3277,This is my favorite game ever
3278,"I needed a way to commit suicide that would be extremley painful. This game perfectly fitted what I needed!!! I knew a peice of shit like myself didn't deserve a painless way like a gun shot to the head ol' Kurt Cobain style, so this game came as a great alternative. I later realised that I didn't want to die alone so I bought my friends a copy of the game so they could kill themselves to. All in all it was the best suicide pact I've ever made and I would recomend this game to anyone who hates their lives and/or themselves"

3282,"This game is good. Classic game.
The gameplay is good. And you can play with your friends so you can fun. Unfortunately not too much players playing with this."
3283,I love this game more than any other on Steam even though it is ancient. It is just so well balanced and the weapons are great. Fun for a thousand hours.
3284,*Sees an enemy* .... *takes the revolver* .... *headshot* ...... *Now the enemy swears and yells at me*
3285,"You can kill someone by throwing a toilet at them.

If that's not enough for you to buy the game, not sure what will."
3286,"I love this game. I've clocked ~900 hours on it.
I like FPS games that you can get a quick start in. In most HL2:DM servers, players spawn with or near crucial weapons, making everyone dangerous and equally matched, all coming down to skill."
3287,One of the best deathmatch games of all time!
3288,"This was always my favorite game to play, I was saddened that it basically died off because of TF2."
3289,I put an embarrasing amount of hours into this game and had lots of fun and memorable moments in it but in looking back on it all I can think is how embarrassed I am to have put 200 hours in a cheap half life multiplayer.
3290,Really fun mod to have. Its great if you adore half life!
3291,Spawnrape and foreign language audio/txt downloading all the time
3292,"I threw a toilet at somebody and killed them, never played since.

3297,"It sucks. Weapon damage is way off, either too underpowered or overpowered, its laggy, choppy, players are toxic and is boring overall. Basically a downgraded retarded gmod."
3298,"Stupid set up, Stupid game, what is the point? and to set up your own server you need to be Einstein >.<"
3299,"I loved Half-life, and Half-life 2  and its episodes as well, so I thought this game would be as much fun or maybe even more as those games were. Well, it clearly wasn't, but I kept trying with it. I have joined to several different servers and none of them seemed to be good, for me this game is a big dissapointment. Without your own server this game is not fun, and making one is hard due to errors. The worst thing is that, the game is forcing you to be a combine soldier, I know there is a way to change it and that worked fine, but after every team deathmatch my player model changed back, it was so annoying."
3300,"Meh. It's not gonna be easy if you're starting in 2016, since this has been out since 2004. Expect perfectly timed grenade throws from the other side of the map. Expect a lot of dying due to the crossbow. Expect a charm that only a simplistic game can bring. I would only recommend it if you REALLY, REALLY can't get enough Half-Life 2."
3301,Nice made game but you are to easy to be killed if you dont have some skills you may want to add some training for faster movement and thinking but nice game i would buy it again if i need
3302,"The multiplayer is almost dead because of unbalanced SF stuff. it`s something else when you play campaign and it`s totally different when you play MP. It`s good, but for me it`s not my style.

3303,"An excellent game! Really fun, runs great and it looks superb (especially for a 2004 game!)"
3304,"I'm pretty sure I got this for free, or as a gift once upon a time.... Either way, it still has plently of active players in it to make it ""alive"", and is a classic deathmatch game. With that being said, most of the players are vets; leaving anyone new a meaty target for free kills."
3305,"It says I have 53 hours but I swear I'm way over that.
Got this for free around 2010-2011 for free with that old graphics card deal thingy and I played the ever living hell out of it.
Shame it's dead, you can occasionally find a decently full server nowadays though, well work picking it up and giving it a try if you're into deathmatch or coop styled games."
3306,mmmmm
3307,"I love all the Half life serie, but I thik that this game could be really better. It have a bit disapointed me. Anyway i like it"
3308,Pree coo dead doe
3309,it's pretty good i guess. it's legit half-life 2 online
3310,"Quite an underrated FPS in my opinion, will run on almost any computer no matter how shit and can be fairly competitive. This game is good for those getting into shooters for the first time or when playing on a rubbish computer. The only problems I have are the large amounts of crap that can be installed due to visiting different servers, and the fairly limited choice of weapons. Nevertheless, this is a fun game."
3311,I wish more people played this back in the days over a decade ago.
3312,Good Game :3

Shame the community is as good as dead."
3318,"It has a shit community but it's an alright game otherwise.
Everyone keeps on propkilling, which is very annoying.  My ping tends to be really high, and everyone uses Sourcemod.
There's some people who excessively advertise their low pings which most nobody can even achieve."

3329,"Easily one of the best deathmatch games out there, incredibly fast paced & insane. 
I will always love this game because it was one of the first games I ever played on steam, and the game that got me into playing FPS's in general which created my love for gaming. I will never forget the memories I made with my friend on here <3"
3330,Freakin gravity guns everywhere wtf...10/10 gravity party!
3331,"I've seen reviews saying it's hard to find servers.
[b]IGNORE THEM[/b]. It's easy to find a server. There are plenty at any one time.

Anyway, this game is AMAZING. Don't know if it's 200 hours of (total) HL2 playing or what, but it's HEAPS fun.
And then when I find I'm coming first on my first game, well, even more fun.

Play this NOW."
3332,"Many of the servers are still active, and the action is always fun and fast-paced. There are a few people out there who use hacks and the like, but they don't interfere very much. System requirements are low considering how the game still holds up graphically today. It looks a little dated, but it will still provide hours of entertainment."
3333,csgo if it had propkilling and was hl2 and wasnt tryhard
3334,First FPS I ever played. Best toilet throwing simulator out there.

3347,"I'd give this a 4 out of 5 stars. I love playing this game, I mean, Half Life 2 AND Multiplayer? Fuck yea! Only thing that I hate about this game is you can never choose you're own skin, everytime I try to switch to police it takes me back to soldier, and when I click on one rebel skin it either goes on another rebel skin or combine soldier AGAIN. So yea, that sucks, but still pretty good game over all."
3348,A actually fun multiplayer.
3349,This game believe it or not may need a beefy computer since I have a PC that is way better than the recommended hardware that is listed above and I still can not run this game a constant 30 FPS. Although a minor setback with hardware I have been able to play this game on another PC and account which was a very interesting experience because of the PvP dynamics.
3350,"Nice, now you can play with the pros."
3351,"For all you poo sharks out there. That are obsessed with CSGO like..... Angel (bold and brash) you'll like this game to. It runs off a good engine, decent graphics and runs smoothly on the crappiest computer of all! :D"

3362,Fun!
3363,"My experience with this game:

>Sees new game that magically appeared in my library named Half Life 2 Deathmatch
>Out of boredom hits play
>Joins a lobby set in a town
>Everyone is lurking on rooftops waiting for the perfect moment to add one more person to the angry FNAF community that comments on every f*cking youtube video that has ever been posted
>Goes to my local walmart in-game to get me some ammo and suit charge
>Runs outside and instantly gets obliterated by the all powerful Mad Squeaker Producing Gun Of Doom (or, as you people like to call it, the RPG)
>Comes to the sudden realization that these people on this server are what most people would call ""no-life scumbags""
>Joins another server this time in some wooden cage arena and instantly gets decimated by some hacker that nobody has killed yet
>Screams at my computer and hurls explosive barrels everywhere in game, only to aggravate the hacker into teleporting me to his perch at the top of the map
>Gets shanked with a stunstick
>People are laughing in chat while the hacker is telling me to get out of the lobby
>Gladly, I do, and also delete this game off my computer

Multiplayer? Check.

3371,its fun with friends
3372,"This game is a little slow paced compared to Call of Duty and other FPS's, but this game is by far the best military simulator with extremely large maps and a huge variety of vehicles and weapons to choose from. Singleplayer is not so great but all of the fun and action comes from the co-op missions online. You won't get anywhere in this game without an organized team which is one of the many reasons why this game is so fun. Highly recommended. Blows any competition out of the water (Op Flashpoint: Dragon Rising, CoD, MoH, etc.)."
3373,The magnum in this game is totally balenced
3374,well i have played it theres alot of buggy things in the game but its ok i like it i love half life 2 it is amazing
3375,Neat game. Source graphics with Old deathmatch gameplay. gets boring after a bit
3376,Cool game.
3377,Fun as fuck!!
3378,I love it.
3379,"I like this game. It's pretty fun, and you get it when you purchase EP1 so you can have a multiplayer experience.

I don't get everyone calling this game empty; It feels somewhat empty, but theres about 20 servers to play on with real people and almost no bots. I wouldn't call it empty, I say it has one foot in the grave. The community is in great shape for 2015, just like CS 1.6. There's still people playing, and there's also a lot of English people.

Also, this game is hard to master. People can kill you with radiators, tooth brushes, rubber ducks (yes) and other objects you can pick up with the gravity gun. Once you get it, you'll have lots of fun. 

Also, DO NOT BUY IT HERE. Go buy HL2 EP1. It comes with EP1, Deathmatch and Deathmatch Source. You'll truly get a bang for your buck."

Many, many hours played mostly.. okay maybe everytime non-steam... Oh guys, those were the days.. It's a good game like all Half-Life games but with nearly death community.. Everyone is on CS:GO now and this is empty, about 3-4 guys online.. 

But you can give it a try, it can be amazing game.."
3420,Awsome FPS with all the elements of HL2!

The controls are great, the physics are amazing. The weapons is just the standard Half life 2 arsenal, not many but the ones that are there are great. many people say this game is death, wich isn't the case. Maybe there are less servers than other more populair games but there still are plenty with a reasnonable amount of players. Even if you don't like Half-life I still reccomend this. For me it's a 10/10"

3432,"I adore this game, about 57 hours of this game were spent on a ""killbox low gravity server"" which kinda made it emphisise timings with bunny hopping, strafing in air and reactions with gravity guns. Game servers are kinda dieing, check on steamcharts before buying."

3438,"Easily one of my all-time favorite games. However, that being said, I wouldn't buy it anymore. It is a dead game, sadly, and simply isn't much fun alone. If you have friends that are interested, then you should all buy it and have a blast playing. But if you're a solo player interested in trying it out, I'd suggest passing on it. I can't give it a negative review because it is an amazing game, but I will say that while I will awlays love (and still play it personally) HL2:DM, it's simply a game of the past."

Half life 2 deathmatch a fun and kind of silly add on to hl2 but this can get competitive with a group of friends and an empty server, this game is like, for lack of a better term, cod,tf2,and hl2 together-tf2s zaniness, hl2s weapons and character models, and cods competitive fps side. I really enjoy this game, its not needed for the story of hl2 but for the gameplay.

3447,Nice Game I loved So much
3448,sick
3449,This game is nearly dead but it is good since it has a large community on the killbox servers that you might encounter. I must say that this game does remake the old Half-life 2 feeling but in multiplayer. I say you should pick Half-life 2 Deathmatch up it is worth it in the end. My final rating for this game is a 9/10. (would be 10 if the game was not so dead.)

3451,Very fun multi player game related to Half-life.  Im glad most steam users still play this game.

3518,Words cannot descrive the moments i've had in this game.
3519,This game made my willys feel all warm and fuzzy
3520,"It's fun, but it is old. One of the last server based multi-player shooters, which means no match making. Just connect to server and start playing. There are some special movements and trick shots for different weapons that can take a while to master, especially if the server is running a mod. Mods typically include low-gravity, 1-shot kills, or weapon mods, so a new player will be majorly outclassed against an experienced player. Considering the age of the game and the games that came before this one, there are a lot of diehard players with decades of old-school first-person-shooter experience still playing this game. I have played it since release. It was my main multiplayer game for several years and I still come back to it for some fast paced, high-skilled action."
3521,Super OG game. The community seems exclusive and few people play it. Those who do own servers host games of unparalelled value.
3522,Yeah... this game is deader then The Spice Girls... but I really wish it got back on it's feet.
3523,Toilets are BS
3524,Pre good ^__^
3525,"This is HANDS DOWN the best multiplayer shooter in history. Simple and stupid, yet has an extremely high skill ceiling. HIGHLY reccomended."
3526,Half Life 2 is one of the best games ever! The deathmatch is very fun.If you loved Half Life 2 you will not be disappointed with this multiplayer game. I give this a 9/10.
3527,"came before half-life 2
and you can play as combine
#SPOILERS!!!!!"
3528,good
3529,why do i have 16 hours on this
3530,"Fast paced, be ready for fun!"
3531,"Hi Community,

HL2DM was the first game you have to have Internet to create an account, the game ans so on. Only for this game i got an it connection. I have plyed the game almost for TEN years and in my opinion it is one of the best Multiplayer online Deathmatch/Team Deathmatch game, if you have learned the advanced techniques like fast orb, fast nades etc. it will bring you alot of fun, believe me. Alone with the Gravity Gun was a great thing to have in the game. I am pretty sad about, that this game seems to be dead! But hey, maybe a new DM version comes along with HL3, that would be awesome, when the game comes out at all. Summa Summarum it`s to say that this ""mod"" of the genuine Half Life2 game is the best i have played so long. I personally give this game a 8.5 from 10. 
I wish you all the best and god may bless you.

Greetings

Ok first things first  this is a good game but there is  a lack of injoyadle maps for me being every map other than overwach and lockdown along with its unarignalalty. Thats probly the only downsides to it though becouse the endles chaos in this game is amazing uspeshly when your on the balcony thing on overwhach with the RPG and see your enemys bodys go flying or camp under the stars in lockdown . enyway im just proud i dident make eny half life 3 refr GOD DAMM IT !"

3547,"I have been playing this game since I was a teenager. Now 10 years later, I still play this game from time to time. It's one of my all time favorite games. I just hope that they do make half life 3. Even though it's just rumors. I just they become true."
3548,The Authentic Intense Hardcore Shooter Game. Really test players' mind. There ain't much players around yes. But nothing denies the fact it's an awesome game and it gave me memory and experience I'd never forget.
3549,"A majority of servers are dead, but theres still some kicking. I recommend it because i had fun and its still playable and as long as i find it amusing then i dont see the problem. Give this a try when you get the chance and if you are in a mood to try it."

The title says it all: Fun 2.0"
3555,"HL2DM is a great game with far better hit detection than say CSS. However, with that said the game is nearly dead. I booted it up today to find 4 servers one of which was empty, another had 2 players, a third was password protected, and the 4th had six players playing a varient with one shot 9mm kills. If it was free I would would without a doubt reccomend this game, but with a five dollar price tag and the game having such a small playerbase(almost to the point of unplayabilty) I cannot reccomend it."

3572,One of the best Deathmatch games ever.
3573,"I am re-doing my review, as it must have just been due to the timing when there were few players on. When I check today, there are a couple hundred on the servers.

In the time I have had in the game, it gives a nice, fast paced deathmatch experience in Half-Life settings, using Half-Life levels. There are plenty of custom levels, includng different modes such as puzzle or co-op. It brings a good bit of fun. Recommended."
3574,Bring som friends along. Fun is to be had here :)
3575,Good all DM fun. Why not.
3576,"this is a really fun game, although people on deathmatches regularly just use a pistol, its an insta kill, but besides that, on tdm its really fun, killbox, lockdown, all that stuff its still alive! it runs up still!"
3577,"R.I.P Half Life 2:Deathmatch , my most played game on steam ,with 605 hrs of my life sunkt in it."
3578,"Honestly, the multiplayer is dead.  It is hard to find a normal server.  If you like 1 shot kills, pretty lame RPs, or just servers that you mess around on, this is for you.  If you have a large group to play it with, I do recommend it.  Other wise, it is pretty dead."

3582,Just take the maps and weapons from HL2 and put them in Counter-Strike. Tset up your own server to play with your friends and BAM! you have about 2-3 hours of fun deathmatch with your friends.
3583,"I like this game. It's pretty fun, and you get it when you purchase EP1 so you can have a multiplayer experience.

I don't get everyone calling this game empty; It feels somewhat empty, but theres about 20 servers to play on with real people and almost no bots. I wouldn't call it empty, I say it has one foot in the grave. The community is in great shape for 2015, just like CS 1.6. There's still people playing, and there's also a lot of English people.

Also, this game is hard to master. People can kill you with radiators, tooth brushes, rubber ducks (yes) and other objects you can pick up with the gravity gun. Once you get it, you'll have lots of fun. 

[b]Also, DO NOT BUY IT HERE. Go buy HL2 EP1. It comes with EP1, Deathmatch and Deathmatch Source. You'll truly get a bang for your buck.[/b]"

3589,"Fantastic, action packed game with the unique ability to hurl any object to kill enemies. RPG gets a bit overpowered though. This game succeeds greatly at keeping the same great hl2 atmosphere and environments. It'd be nice if valve actually cared about this game and didn't let it rot without patches or attention."
3590,
3591,"Meh. Gets kinda boring quickly. Boring community, players rarely talk, and servers are quite empty too. This one is dead IMO."
3592,"I love half life ! but I wasted my money on this dead game and it lags too much.. I could not enjoy it. but is a good game tho. Like I said, its a dead game"
3593,The best co-op game ever !!!!
3594,"My experience in Half-Life 2: Deathmatch have been quite fun. The overall appeal of the game is to kill your friends with the weapons from Half Life 2. Not many people still play so the game is in a way dead. However, even though there are only a maximum of 40 people on at once I could always find a server to play on. For me it got boring occasionally because most of the servers are going to be the vanilla deathmatch. I rate this game 7/10 for its gameplay and appeal, also at five dollars it's worth it."

3618,"Half-Life 2 Deathmatch is a FPS / First Person Shooter.

This is the online part of the game.
Keep in mind this is only multiplayer so no story mode.
There are many servers to play still after all these years it's out.
Normal...... as many custom servers so allways you can find something new.

You can buy this with a packeds with HF2 or seperately for sale.

One of the best fun multiplayer FPS game still to play. Score 10/10 !!"
3619,"So I got Half Life 2 Deathmatch on the steam sales partnered with the Games CSSOURCE and Day of Defeat, I didn't buy the back for this game at all but it provided an added bonus and so I played my games, I played a tiny bit of Half Life 2 deathmatch and to me it felt like a gmod gamemode
But recently I revisted it, I found it really fun It quite crazy but its good fun just running around getting kills, I especially like the gravity gun in it. However it isn't exactly the largest game you get what you pay for, theres 1 mode on about 7 maps, but its a good casual game! and with some tweeking maybe even the addition of classes this could be an excellent standlone multiplayer shooter, Its good fun and you should get it its only 3.99!"

I've enjoyed some great RP experiences that have since moved on to greener pastures.

That doesn't leave me much to comment on, so enjoy the few minutes of exciting combat you get before you get bored.

Cannot reccomend due to the limited support both from valve and the community. Let this old gem return to the rough."
3647,"At the time of this review I've only played for exactly one hour. One of the best hours of my gaming life.
I mean, holy sh*t. I forgot the name of the map that I played on my first time (EDIT: dm_killbox_dev_skm), but when I played it, it felt like the gaming version of Mad Max: Fury Road! Sh*t is flying everywhere, 20% of it exploding, you have 6 seconds to find out what the heck you're doing before your corpse starts flying too, it's f**king insane!
And I loved every second of it! But then they changed the server.
Now I'm on a map that I previously played alone on GMOD. I grab a half-broken boat and fling it at a guy, instantly killing him. I later grab a cylinder and kill the same guy again with it. Did I mention you can do this with sinks and toilets?
My biggest complaint is that sprint is using HL2 rules, which is pretty much 5 seconds of running instead of until you let go of the shift key in GMod. Otherwise, this game's main price is $5. $5!!!!!
8/10"

You will need the source engine, which you get if you have half-life 2. This is fast-paced, fun, and does not require a lot of setup or long loading times. You can start or stop playing quickly."

3659,"My review for Half-Life 2 can be seen here:
http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198056186683/recommended/220

I personally enjoyed Half-Life deathmatch a great deal and had an amazing explosive online experience. While Half-Life 2 surpassed the incredible Half-Life singleplayer it's multiplayer did not thanks to the lack of interesting weapons and time itself. No one is playing this. The physics are neat but Half-Life 2 weapons were not the best part of Half-Life 2. They weren't bad or anything but when all your doing is shooting the problems HL2's arsenal had start to show. It never had a lot of support and the maps on offer are quite dull compared to HL1's which is a shame. The year is 2016 and I can think of no reason to play this as it doesn't even have bots (Mods don't count and the bots mod for this is hard to find and hard to install.) meaning that you would be spending 5 dollars to move around an empty map thinking sad thoughts like ""Will I be alive to see Half-Life 3?"".

3665,FUCKING TOILETS
3666,Simple and fun game
3667,"What's the point of this game? It's nothing but spawn campers insta kills and it's hard to move any where without getting INSTA KIILED! I launched the game for the first time thinking it will just be last man standing, but then I saw the title screen and there were rebles and combine, so I thought ok so it's team deathmatch and I joined a server with a decent amout of people in it and the first thing I saw was a player flying straight twords me and one shot me with an smg. I was starting to get confused because the description of the game says ""Play straight deathmatch or try Combine vs. Resistance teamplay."" But it doesn't say anything about spawn camping or insta killing. So I tried another server and the same thing was happining people camping every where because they knew if they moved any where they would die. So really this game is the devil in disguise, don't get this game unless you want to be that guy. I'm lucky though, I didn't spend any money on this game, it came free with half life 2 episode 2."
3668,"I trow a toilet to a guy he got killed.


10/10 i would trow a toilet again in a random dud."
3669,Great game it could have been a lot better if valve kept updating it instead of abandoning it. You will probably encounter a lot of annoying cancerous old people that sound like they are smoking 12 packs of cigarettes a day they are worse than 12 year old kids. Waaah  you are not allowed to kill me ! Waah i will kick you because you are bunny hopping ! even if  its part of game but you cant do it waah stop runing waah why are you  jumping around i cant hit you because im an and old cancerous german man  nein nein nein zis is not allowed mein freund i will zend you to ze camp if you do ze bunny hop again ok?  dude its cancer id rather play with children holy shit.
3670,This game is amazing if you like HL2 or HL then you should definitely get this! It is a very addicting balanced game and it's not p2w either. In the beginning you will get destroyed but as you keep playing the better you get until you're finally really good. Very alive and active community.
3671,Why not. its half life right?
3672,"This is a good game, but it gets me dizzy
10/10"
3673,"The game itself is a good, fast-paced, can be funny and would be enjoyable, however...

It's 2015 we are talking about, and even back in 2010, the game was mostly played by veterans who wrecked you all the time. Of course all games have very good and pro players, but with HL2DM, it reaches the point where the game becomes boring and dull, with the same guy killing you for the 15th time in a few minutes.

But it is definitely old school! No ranks, no skill groups, no unlocks, no microtransactions, nothing, you just join a server and that's it, every single player is equal, no cosmetics, no bullshit..."
3674,"Half-Life 2: Deathmatch is a great experience for any skill level, it pits the Combine and resistance in a close quarters and fast paced environment. From there you duke it out with friends or in quick match to the end. This makes for countless matches of quality entertainment."

3695,"Almost no servers to play on, and the few that I actually could play on I was getting spawn camped for 2/3 of the fucking match. I ended up with like 14 kills and 50 deaths, most of which were from being spawn camped.

I wanted to like this game but this just pisses me off too much to actually enjoy it. Buy CS:GO or GMod instead."

3700,"Apparently every  thrown item in this game is a toilet.
Useful information for real life.
10/10 Would throw cabinet toilet again."
3701,"An absolute blast!  Fast-paced, chaotic, and a load of fun."
3702,"Honestly, it's not terrible. The problem is in trying to find a non RP server with enough players and decent latency, without unbalanced user-created maps, bad respawns, and people who giggle and spout incoherent BS into their mics the whole time. Once you find a good server, it's self-explanatory: Multiplayer Deathmatch with HL2 weapons.

It's worth a try, but only as part of a pack, and only on sale."
3703,Good if you manage to a server with good ping and normal gravity.
3704,"Deathmatch part of Half-Life 2 was released separately around two weeks after release of Single-player portion. So yea, nowadays you will have to buy it separately. 

Community is small but living. Sometimes you will have over five or ten players in each of five servers or so. Sometimes it's just fourteen players filling up single server. It still is enough to have fun with basic stuff. Community has preference of playing either Deathmatch on some low-gravity killbox map or team Deathmatch on Runoff map, which is quite horrible.

So yes, you got Deathmatch. And you also got Team Deathmatch, which divides players between Combines and Rebels. The only difference is reskin of useless melee weapon.

You will also can find some people playing cooperative mod (usually invasion style thing) or roleplay ones.

It comes with few official maps, though most likely you will only get to see Runoff. Which is badly made, giving Combine side a rocket launcher right at the start, while making Rebels have to walk back to get more or less good weapons. It also has a looong dead end, which only has shotgun at the end, as if it's some kind of super weapon.

It's quite standard deathmatch game from older times. You got arena, you spawn in random spot or so, you have to collect pickups, there is no leveling. You don't usually survive encounters, so don't expect to be able to run away to get some health, it's kinda chaotic.

Being based on Half-Life 2, it brings physics into gameplay. Mostly it comes to ability to pick any object with gravi-gun and throw it at opponent. Another common tactic is using it to throw grenades that you put onto ground. It's not much of use otherwise, you can't get much of creative uses of gravi-gun in game where amount of kills is what counts. You may try to make ladders somewhere or try to block doorways with objects, but it's weak tactics.

Weapon balance is where HL2: Deathmatch fails. There are two things that win the games: explosions and revolver.
Any explosion has huge radius and would kill anybody immediately. And rocket launcher has rockets that are homing to the spot that you are pointing it, so players rarely escape whoever has rocket launcher. Those who don't have such weapons can just lob grenade onto floor, grab it with gravi-gun and then throw it as opponent, making sure that it will explode near player. Which requires timing. But still.
When you don't get rocket launcher, you should go for revolver. It's a highly accurate hitscan weapon that requires only two shots to kill players, or even one if it's a headshot. Let's say, a skilled player can dominate both long-range and short-range as long as they know how to aim. After all, you can use Zoom, even though you have to release Zoom button before being able to fire. Nothing much that other players can do against that.

Otherwise, you will use either crossbow or shotgun for short range. Yes, crossbow. Revolver is more effective at long range. So you just insta-kill people at very close range with bolts, as long as you can predict. Otherwise just do double-shot with shotgun. Yes, double-shot, alternative fire. Always do it.

Everything else takes too long to kill and thus is quite useless.

So, what we got there, is a Deathmatch that feels tucked on the Half-Life 2, keeping weapon balance that was designed for single-player. It's not terribly balanced and fun. But I guess it should be amusing with bunch of friends, to fool around."
3705,This game has very little people playing on the servers.
3706,I really recommend this game to many people all maps have it's secrets. like a one with a bunker my friend turned on the alarm and fought me off then the doors started closing slowly and I was locked out the doors closed. and pods launched BOOM! BOOM! BOOM! BOOM! AAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHH and i died. and there are rocket launchers and gernades mines pulse rifles (that desintagrate people). and if anyone who reads this that doesn't like bloody games go ahead and ignore it. but other than that I HIGHLY roccomed playing this so buy it now!
3707,this was a mistake do not buy
3708,"i have had this game since the Collectors Edition Pysical box set and i have to say its one of the best FPS multiplayer shooters i have played for just random fun.
 In what other game can you kill someone by hucking a toilet at them or just beat them relentlessly with a stunstick?
a-bit aged now (2015) but still a ton of fun and if you own a Novint falcon and an Oculus Rift its a must have for sure."
3709,"It's just like Half-Life 2 but it's a DM.

Its a really good game!

BUT! 

It's not so popular and if its not popular its not many ppl playing.

Im sure is you update the game many more players want to buy this game!

3712,"Valve couldn't have spent less time making a multiplayer for Half-Life 2. It's understandable that Half-Life 2 is meant as a single-player game, but if you're going to include a multiplayer you better do it correctly or not at all. I don't think I have ever been so bored playing a game as this.

3742,"Two words: Roleplay. Servers.  What was once an amazing deathmatch-type game has steadily devolved into a hub for horny little children to roleplay, and for stoners just to be stoned.  In the servers that Aren't for roleplay, you won't really have too much fun unless you joined early, as you can guarantee everyone else will have gotten the RPG, full ammo, and have memorized every spawn location, meaning the moment you spawn, you get bombarded with rockets.  If you're lucky, you'll get 5-10 seconds before they take aim with their crossbows.  Either way, this is a game for the lucky, and for the cheap, so pick up your one-shot-kill guns, take down noobs, and feel unwarranted self-importance over your fake skill until karma catches up!  

Ultimately, the appeal of the game is ruined by the overzealous try-hards who don't understand their ""skill"" ultimately ruins the game for everyone else.

3748,I enjoyed this
3749,"I am a huge fan of Half Life 2 (And its episodes. And the first game. And its expansions). I am also a huge fan of Valve's other popular FPS games (TF2, CS:GO). But, I am not a fan of this game. In fact this is one of the worst (Valve) games I have ever played. It is very, very unbalanced and not very optimized. It was hard for me to play at all on their servers. Plus, there would always be people running around with the .357, which, if you didn't know, is an instakill to the head. The items that you start off with do very little damage, and the gravity gun is practically useless. If you wanted gameplay featured in this game, just play Half Life 2: its got the same weapons, but its much more balanced. Please, save your money, and buy a different game. This one is too unbalanced and not friendly to new players."

3762,"This game has been dope when it came out.
I really haven't played it since then, though.
The deathmatch with physics was really fun.
But the player base moved to different stuff.
Either the 'CS' games, or simply Garry's Mod.
This game deserves my short positive review.
You can still enjoy this game to some degree.
There's still a handful of active servers in this.
Or you can play with your friends for a while.
It really isn't bad, It's just a little less popular.
The concept and the gameplay is top notch.
Especially the physics based combat is neat.
And I just have to give it my positive review."
3763,"This game was never the way I planned, not my intention.  I got so brave, mouse in hand, lost my direction.  It's not what I'm used to, just wanna try it out.  I'm curious for crowbar, caught my attention.

I kissed a camel and I liked it, the taste of the sandy slapstick.  I kissed a camel just to try it, I hope my affendi don't mind it.  It felt so wrong, it felt so right.  Don't mean I'm humping tonight.

Yes, this song much like re-bastardisation of Half Life Deathmatch Classic."

BUT it is almost dead I would say. First of all there are a lot of empty servers. I can't stand the fact that classic maps are forgotten and abandoned which is an absolute shame. Further more some servers use bots, very easy ones. If you get some people to play with it can be very fun and engaging. I do recommend this game however only if you can spare some copies of this game to your friends. Should it ever become F2P? Huge influx of players would mean more emotionally unstable individuals but since HL2DM is not a competitive title I think we'd be just fine."

Having been long-since abanonded by Valve at the time that I'm writing this review, this game is filled to the brim with cancerous, plug-in coated servers that constantly spew obnoxious and eardrum bursting sounds and obscenities at you. Perhaps the base game was good, but at this point, leave this game in the grave that Valve put it in."

Fast gameplay and great players, if you are looking for a challenge; I would suggest buying this game and finding a server to play with people who spend 5k+ hours on it already.

Game can get a bit frustrating at times but HL is not to blame for that. Servers are hosted by players and thus also costumized by them. Or something like that.

3854,"I guess I could say its pretty cool. HL2 Deathmatch, is a fps kind of for Half Life. It always have enough people, which is great, and mostly is fun, to battle with the weapons youve always used in Garrys Mod or other Half Life games. Its cheap enough to buy it, no big regrets."
3855,Its cool FPS game xD
3856,"This game is quite fun, especially on Killbox, my fav. map so far. I play this game when I am bored and own dem n00bs with the crossbow. The crossbow was my fav. weapon in the original half-Life, but I feel that the HL2 crossbow has a slower projectile, just me?
Good game, good game"
3857,Basically GMOD with no spawnability.
3858,Pretty fun if you have friends :D But you'll lose them after playing w/ them lol
3859,"Buy Half Life 2 Deatmatch They Said...It will be fun they sai...*ROCKET LAUNCHER*
Actually this game is so goo...*Your Ping is High KICKED OUTTA SERVER*"
3860,Весело но мало )
3861,"After 10 years still a good game with nice physics engine. Slowly the community is almost dead, but some good players and servers you can still find. At deathmatch its better than CounterStrike, at teamdeathmatch not as its not so high tactical game. Maps are also many nice ones around made by the community. Some servers use funny mods or settings. The community itself could be a bit more friendly, as some players flaming around a lot. But in other games its mostly the same. About gameplay... it takes a while till you get involved with some tricks and the physcannon, but after a while you won`t miss that game. Cheaters are also some around, but not as much as in CounterStrike. Try to learn nade-throwing with physcannon and good jump techniques beside your aim, than you have a lot of fun. check out hl2dm.net, tsgk.com, half-life-gaming.net, bloodsuckers.de."
3862,its cool

3867,"Edited review (old one was from 2015)

Half-Life 2 Deathmatch, A Game you get along with Half-Life 2 as a ""expansion"" because for some reason Valve didn't incorporated multiplayer into Half-Life 2 even if they could.

At the time I write this, the game is very dead unfortunately, forgotten from internet, left into dust, like the rest of the old games. It's' quite fun to throw boxes and bunch into each other, frustrating? sure maybe..."
3868,6230 Hours. Help me.
3869,Everyone else is really good at this game. Im not at all. But it is satifying to kill someone with a chair.
3870,A genius game full of love for every sick gamer kid.
3871,Let's have some fun !
3872,"Half-Life 2: Deathmatch is a fun FPS game to play online by yourself or with a friend, It still has alot of players activly playing the game online, and has great maps and game modes, which always keep it interesting.

I recommend this game to any one looking for a classic Counter Strike style FPS.

8/10"
3873,this game is olf but fun i got it for free
3874,This is the best game ever. I love all episodes of Half Life and also the Deathmatch.

3876,This game is one of the overlooked gems of valve. it is a really fun game with the classic half-life feel! have you ever wanted to toss a melon or a toilet at someone? than this is DEFINETLY the game for you!
3877,Very Oldest game. and  i didnt try this game. 7.5/10 cuz 125 friends. + got 245+hours on record but now 4.9 so i take this one 7.5/10 and + 1 guy wants this game so 8/10+ this game kind of fps so i take the last 8.5/10
3878,Really fun. I wish I made this game and someone else made this review.
3879,Highly recomend this game. I bought it back when it was free but its defenitely worth the 5.49$. you can play CO-OP on servers and battle combine and zombies.You can also battle other players. There are also puzzle maps too :D. Really fun to port forward and play with friends! Recommended! +1
3880,"There are custom user-made maps, so it's not repetitive. Also co-ops, in which I find more fun than in deathmatch, but that's just me. I fully recommend it if you are looking for a online multiplayer deathmatch FPS (and co-ops with the custom user-created maps)."
3881,Awesome awesome awesome !! Very like!!
3882,"VERY GOOD GAME.i'LL RECOMMEND TO BUY IT. 
 Its fun , i'll support this game till the end of the WORLD.

3886,Love HL2:DM.. Just wish more people played..
3887,"Half-Life is cool. But its power is in singleplayers. Not in Deathmatches.
Only one thing which can drag You into deathmatch fight is Gravity Gun. And that is not too much.
regrettably, there is a lot of better Multiplayer shootouts."

3893,"The creativity of the server admins really makes this game. If you get tired of one thing, there are always tons of other things to do."
3894,"I like this game. I have more than 1000 hours play time with it. It's over 10 years old, from what I understand, so the hardware requirements aren't too heavy for a current or older gaming machine. 
For an older FPS it holds up well. Plenty of maps. Runs on Steam. Part of Half-Life 2. 
Check it out. We can always use more victims!

"
3895,"Classic as fak, Go play it at once before going into Call of Kids."
3896,"I have only played this for a few hours, but I can already tell why some have thousands of hours clocked in on this game.

Half life 2's gameplay is one of the best I've ever played, and playing against real people just makes it even better. It is the most fun I've had on a multiplayer game in a long time.

Yes, the community might be dying, but it's not dead yet; I have always been able to get servers with a good few people on them. And even though most of them are a lot better than I am and destroy me, it's still immensely fun to play and learn the tricks to get better.

Buy it.
Play it.
Get your friends to play it. 
You'll have great fun."
3897,"Such a nostalgic game - especially the RP servers. It is unfortunate to see the number of active servers decreasing, but still an amazing game nonetheless!"
3898,The only thing I use this for is its SDK so I can make maps for Garry's mod. 11/10 would mod again.
3899,"I wasted my entire middle school life on this game. And given the chance, I would do it again in a heartbeat.
Whether it was the RP servers, the jump/surf maps, or the puzzle maps, I enjoyed it all.
Rip in peace, Abusement Park. We had good times together."
3900,I don't remember buying this.
3901,toilet throwing sim good
3902,it is a grate game to play
3903,"I loved HF2 and really wanted to like this game, but I was very dissapointed. Very few servers had players and the two I did try were dominated by pros who decimated new players. WIthin 5 minutes, I was so fustrated by the one-sided battles that it stopped being fun. Honestly, if you dont mind dying a lot and  rarely making a kill, the guns and maps are fun> however, for most players, it will be aggrevating. Trust me, go TF2 instead."
3904,"At almost 20 years old, this was the first Half Life experience I ever had. Yes, I live under a rock. After playing JUST 45 mins, I had a big goofy smile on my face, my problems all disappeared, my penis grew by 3 inches and I can now suddenly play guitar like Eddie Van Halen. Thank you HL2 Deathmatch!!"
3905,A huge Massive yes. Death match is as good now as it was when it was first released. A little tricky to set up a server at first but any game that produces endless hours of fun with my brothers untill 3am is always worth it.
3906,my early gaming life was mostly spent on this game
3907,Great!
3908,"fuck THIS
"
3909,"Even though Half Life 2 and this came out in 2004 (10 years ago), The graphics still hold up amazingly well. This game has aged so quickly. Deathmatch is fun, very fast paced and continues to have some of the best physics in gaming. This game still continues to marvel. Although it does rather lack content nowadays, it still holds up very well. Great gameplay and a great community are its strong suits. It is definitly worth the buy, its $5 bucks worth spent."
3910,this game is bad
3911,NEVER.BUY.THIS.GAME
3912,Not worth it considering the mods that are available like AG
3913,After playing this for a few hours I've decided that this game can be considered worth it.
3914,"Despite how it may look, this game is probably one of the best games to mess around in with your friends. If you are a loner, i would not recommend this game to you. However, if you have 3 or 4 friends and nothing to do for 2+ hours, than this is your game.

Would get 300 kills again."
3916,"Not balanced in the slightest. To not be taken seriously. Might be one of the worst FPS ever, but damn it is fun to play with friends."
3917,"I like Half-Life 2 : Deathmatch. I dont know a better way to describe the game better than the title does. This is Half - Life 2, but with deathmatch modes.  There are custom servers and maps like most other source games. There is a low player base in my opinion. This fact however does not change the fact that the game can be pretty enjoyable. I have not played it long enough to be 100% certain, but I would say there are at least 4-5 servers going at most times.  I definitely recommend  This if you are a fan of Half - Life, or source ""style"" gameplay."
3918,Its awesome.
3919,The Half-Life 2 gameplay style worked really well in singleplayer but I also really enjoyed in a multiplayer setting too. I don't know if I'd recommend this over HL1 MP but for the price (I got this game for free back when Valve had that promo a long time ago.) it's really worth checking out.
3920,"5/10

3924,Good game :).
3925,I killed someone with a toilet. 10/10.
3926,"Valve has a history of making famous Deathmatch games, and thats beacuse they don't bother over complicating the concept of Deathmatch. Tihs game along with Day of Deafeat Source and Counter Strike Source are simple and yet have raked in players by the thousands upon millions. It's a simple Deathmatch experience but it's not anything new. 2 Teams pitted againnst each other with your usuall Team Deathmatch action, nothin to complicated but it is still fun."
3927,Good Multiplayer version of HL2!
3928,Not really worth it anymore.
3929,Co-op
3930,Good for salty nerds like me.
3931,Terrible.
3932,"Take deathmatch, add everything from half life 2 and you have Half life 2 : Deathmatch. Zero point energy gun is OP. Too bad valve doesn't add much to this game mode anymore, can be fun at times."

3938,"Even though this game came out in 2004,  the game is still very much fun as ever.  At price of 4.99,  it is such a crazy bargain.  You will find yourself investing good number of hours blasting your opponents to death.  +1 recommended!"
3939,"Played until my arm died. Great game. You can spend hours on it!

3940,The multiplayer portion to an amazing game. Pretty fun.
3941,"Not great, but you can get some great moments with your friends throwing toilets at you. Only get on sale."
3942,"Cheap game for few rounds of fun. 
I don't think that you will be playing this a lot. Mainly because of the small amount of servers and nothing else to do.
No spawn protection, no official servers, gets boring very quickly.
This should be a part of Half-life 2."
3943,gets boring
3944,Threw a toilet out a window and killed someone. They caught it and fired it at me when I jumped out...
3945,"It's not very popular, but there's quite a lot of people playing, and for $5 it's a steal. Very fun.

7/10 - Good"
3946,"Although the game is dying and there are not that many servers with active players, it can still be fun when you play it once in a while and find servers that you enjoy. Many people playing this game are very good at it so it's not easy for beginners.

I would not suggest buying this at the full price though. I suggest buying it when there's a sale."

3952,"SUCH HALF LIFE SUCH WOW
"
3953,"Fast-paced game based on the best game ever made where you need more than an aim. Kinda hard when you're new, but as you play it longer, you're getting better and better you'll love this game. For me, personally, it's the best FPS game I ever played. 4€? 100% worth it."
3954,"Amazing to play now and then, but I don't think it's a game you play 24/7"
3955,simply the best game ever
3956,"the games mostly dead, bad server problems, lag,cheaters etc. half life 2 deathmatch is an online fps shooter based towards the half life universe, in team servers you can be combine or rebels. you start off with an SMG, pistol, gravity gun and crowbar, (usally) sometimes theres no objectives to complete endless games, pointless levels, some rounds can be fun,overall all 5 of the servers ive played 2 where good and the death mechanics are either to easy to die or to hard to kill others
most of the severs are MLG themed or just random shit thrown in, the most people ive seen in one server is 12, 80% of the servers have 0 players. overall if you can find a good server thats just good ol fun deathmatch i would have recomended BUT theres barely anyone playing


4/10

pros

+ sometimes good level designs
+ fun with freinds
+ good if you can find good servers


cons

- lag (not my computer or internet)
- to many stupid MLG or over the top servers
- some maps have no time limit or goal
- exstremely easy to kill and hard to kill servers


i will not play until it gets better"
3957,Bad game. Not worth any money.
3958,Goods!!!
3959,"I grew up playing Half-Life OZ Deathmatch. This is what is to be expected from Half-Life franchise. I play strictly for the Deathmatch aspect of gameplay and its exactly what I wanted. To be honest if you pick this up you might play it heavy for a while but then it just kinda sits around and you dont do anything with it. The only time I play this is when I feel like going throwback thursday on em', Oldie but goodie... Some shit that I would only play if no one else was online and I was burnt out of my mind after smoking a 12 gram blunt... 

Bottomline: Must have for any nerds collection. 
Extra Perks: Its on sale all the time."

This game is like a relationship, one day you hate it so much and get so angry and the next you love it so much and it's the best game ever.  It has flaws like any person and it has good things about it.  Dispite the bullshit, it's the best fucking game ever made"

3966,Half-Life 2 Deathmatch is a great game but It is unbalanced and has a terrible community. Pretty much anyone who plays this game nowadays are spawn point campers that'll put mines on every spawn point possible and Muslims that make fun of you and crack a 911 joke at any given time. This game can still be good if the spawn points couldn't be camped. Not to mention barley anymore plays it so it definitely isn't worth buying.

3970,this game is so fun
3971,"Great game, definitely one of the better games of my childhood and still the best around. Has Fps action + the ability to ""sprint"" with the games physics allows it to be a fast-er point and click shooter if not the fastest and the props/objects effecting it even more make it unique requiring good senses, reflex, smart reactions, coordination with just about everything to play at a decent potential. Where else can you Yoyo a grenade to keep it from 'cooking' it's fuse out before propelling it on it's last fuse reset that you can time for distance and height in coordination with how fast you are moving and your target's speed and the force of the 'gravity gun' you use to propel it with, no where else but hl2dm. Has different kinds of unique weapons like the gravity gun propelling a object to a person to kill them with, or propelling that object against another object to move that away from a distance. And to block a path with many objects or stack objects to reach a platform. Also the crossbow is an example of unique weapons with how it fires in a arch and hard to aim with even with it's scope but can kill a player instantly and with correct positioning can bounce of the floor walls ceiling terrian etc. and with enough practice can be well aimed to kill a player half the map away behind 2 corridors and a room. That is a taste of the Uniqueness of this game, after overlooking it's default multiplayer team vs team worth, there is it's booming in vast unique options to how to play the game with it's community's modded creations, there is co-op themed maps where you can fight with teammates against hordes of aliens, zombies, monsters and cyborgs getting points with the ability to use them to unlock server abilities to costumize your character with a deferent apearence, both in model skin and size, lights that glow on your model, lights that follow your model and more, then there is puzzle maps where you may enter 1 of 12 parts of the map at a time with your team or individualy and complete tasks like finding the exit in a labyrinth or placing and freezing a pile of crates to build a terrian leading to a exit floating high above in the sky or surfing on long slides without falling into abyss to reach a exit or jumping over ditches, climbing and avoiding obstacles in a temple like area to reach another exit to collect all exits and unlock the last portion of the map to complete it. Then there is Roleplay... a blend of multiplayer fps combat with gta style like the need to Purchase weapons or health or armor. Earning money by the minute with the wage given by your level or killing others for their pocket money, then saving that money to invest in a faster method of earning money like growing drugs to sell or printing money both to us on getting more guns or to purchase a home to hide in and to keep your drugs or printer safe, from other players or other players playing as Cops... who may not only steal your illegal possessions but will also place you in jail for some time so that they too may earn the points they need to progress faster and easier in that server. You may also invest in a home to hide from all players and keep your possessions safe, and to meet with your group of friends to prepare for a war against another gang, or to meet with your gang to prepare for a war against the police in alliance with other gangs for fun or for an event to earn more $. Also events are constant and include situations where a monster is spawned in the map similar to the any/many of the ones found in co-op maps that drop money on death. Another situation would be looking all over the map to find an object or player hiden with more $ $ $ that is given to the winner that finds it first. Or when admins just decide the server is full enough for a mass money drop in the middle of the map including weapons and item drops. There are also many more mods but I just thought to name a few of the ones that have me so adicted to this game. This game is worth the very low ticket price for all the fun is has to offer and is very much Alive, if not so is still rich with creativity you never know what's next. I rate it 5 out of 5 stars * * * * *."

- can get repetitive

[b]Comment:[/b]
Unlike Half Life Deathmatch and Team Fortress Classic this game has enough active players to have plenty of games to join. The gameplay is fun, easy and whacky. Just the way it should be. I got this game with some other Valve games I wanted so I played it a bit. In a summary this is a classic deathmatch style with HL2 weapons. Nothing special but surely cool multiplayer matches with a variety of weapons. Though I haven't played that much this seems like a cool old-school type of multiplayer game and I'd recommend it.

4017,"Being killed by flying toilet is an awesome way to die.
10/10"
4018,Stupid game does not work!
4019,This game is so awesome! i played it not that long but it is a great 10/8 -Rexxy
4020,funny game :D
4021,Not up to speed with more popular sci fi titles. Couldn't keep me interested.
4022,You can kill a dude by throwing a toilet at him 10/10
4023,"It's a good game, fun to mess around on. +1 buy it :)"
4024,"its half life 2 (unless you count custom maps) but its deathmatch


3/3 would play again (for a bit longer but not many people play it (or at least what servers i found))"
4025,The moment that you die from a toilet is the moment you are finished as a gamer
4026,I got launched into the air.
4027,"This game is a semi-ghosttown, but when you get a well populated server (I recommend saigns.de servers, in this and other games too, because you also play with bots) , but it has many fun gamemodes and this game is worth it. It now is 0.99 until 1st October, so it IS worth your cash and time
"
4028,"Do you like to paint things ?
Do you need dark red ?


Well this game lets you pain with dark red paint( BLOOD ifyou don't understand sarcasm )

Long stupid review short You'll have fun with this game if you have one or two friends but by yourself it's mostly pointless

Definitally recommend getting it"
4029,"[h1]The online portion of Half-Life 2 where players wanting to see new levels, modes and more then just Deathmatch!
I played this for hours on end on my old account.

9/10[/h1]"
4030,this is an old game that i have played for many years it is very good an can be enjoyed for houes i hope this game is never taken down
4031,"360 noscoped a guy on mic and he rage quit.
I don't even have to play more, I have fufilled my destiny.
And you can too, buy it.
10/10 IGN
""I really like the guns"""
4032,I miss the olden days
4033,"This site is a great networking  area for ppl of all interest and  ages. Easy to upload and to game up.
Things to work on:
the upgrades need to be 100% flawless or you are going to LOSE cutomers..(beyond Beta)
On personel stie profile..develoup some thing that will  inform you that is waiting to be read."
4034,"Best toilet throwing simulator.
10/10"
4035,"May sound very strange, but the first game I bought on Steam. It's pretty much Half Life 2 multiplayer, it's okay, though a little (very) outdated this day in age."
4036,It's fun to prop kill people in a deathmatch
4037,"This game is still fast,chaotic and awesome!
Be prepare when you spawn, you'll always be in the middle of a deathmatch! :D"
4038,!!!!!!!!!!
4039,"An older game, as it's essentially an extension of Half-Life 2. Even though it's aged now, it still is a blast to play with friends. The Gravity Gun is what makes it so unique to many of the other shooters out there, even today in 2014. Similiar to Quake, it doesn't have a sprawling community to it any longer as Half-Life 2 is well beyond it's years now. If you get into matches you tend to get into an older community that is generally very friendly and results in some of the best games of Deathmatch, or other matchmaking playstyles. All it takes is about 5$ when Half-Life 2 goes on sale, if that even, so I'd recommend anybody who is into shooters to buy this game. I guarantee you'll have a blast in a server that is full of 6+ people, and even less in some situations."
4040,Good but try Counter Strike or Gmod instead!
4041,I love this game it is so fun I love all of the half life games .
4042,hi my name is john
4043,this game is great!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
4044,"This game is pretty fun. My fav. server that I reccomend for all of you guys isthe Pow Mia server. It has bunny hop, low health and more, this was my first multiplayer shooter so i really think it's cool!"
4045,I only had to play 10 minutes of this game to love it.
4046,"This game is great for half life and FPS lovers alike. You can run around as a rebel or combine is many different game modes spraying guns of all types from the half life world. and when death occurs you rag doll so hard. if you like constant killing and death then killbox is for you. there are some old school servers where teamdeathmatch is the mode and you must pick weapons up off the ground. there is the occasional death run servers to spice things up and for the grav gun expers there is a few gravity gun and physics only killing servers.

I just wish there were some acheivments that could be awarded. ive been playing this game for about 6 years now and it never gets old. I would highly reccomend it to anybody."
4047,really fun if u like fast paced fps
4048,"Never got good at Grav-nading, however it's fun to play the game that got me into steam. 
I may only have less then 25 hours playes, but before steam could document hours played, i prolly racked up 300+ hours.
The game is great, the gameplay is fun, and the maps can be insane. the only thing it lacks is a community now a days.

also if anyone has dm_starwars I want a copy of it please."
4049,"This is what I play when I wait for Half-Life 3.

9.5/10"
4050,"You can find pretty cool servers and stuff... hl2 physics and everything but with deathmatches...



get it"
4051,THIS GAME IS SO RANDOM THAT IT IS AMAZING!! IT IS VERY DIFFERENT FROM OTHER FPS!!
4052,10/10
4053,"Fun. 

5/10 - Would Deatmatch"
4054,Childhood memories and puzzle maps.
4055,I can't get the vertical look on my right joystick to work. It works just fine in Half Life 2.
4056,gameplay+enviroment+unlimited maps = awesome
4057,"One of the best multiplayer games out there! If you like Half-Life 2 and fast-action multiplayer, it's for you! And you can throw toilets! 10/10
"
4058,ITS SO AMAZING I AM SO PRO I GOT TOP SCORE ON FIRST GAME!!!!! (MY TEAM SUCKED)
4059,Really good game for its price. Can give a lot of fun by its fast passing and variable gameplay. But it gets some time to learn tricks and be competitive enough.
4060,Best game ever ! No way !
4061,I remember playing this game over lan at the local internet cafe growing up. Those were the good old days. Its been 5 years since ive seen this game but now that I have my own gaming computer and internet connection I can finally play it again! I've been on it for the past hour and I don't regret this buy at all. Every bit as fun as I remember. Great time killer. Graphics have aged very well. I would definitly recommend!! 10/10 would buy again.
4062,I LOVE IT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
4063,The joy of throwing toilet bowls at people on killbox..... Those were the days man...
4064,"The default mode(vanilla, if you will) is terrible. Everything is unbalanced, especially when you factor in the RPG and the revolver. In short, the weapons are very unbalanced and the entirety of the Combine team makes louder walking noises.

This game is a great example to why you shouldn't just copy singleplayer mechanics into a multiplayer game."
4065,This was another game I enjoyed playing. Haven't played in a long time though.
4066,VeRy FuN GaMe :D!!
4067,"Who needs to buy CoD and Battlefield when there's HL2 and HL3 confirmed? (Confirming)............
11/10 for the craziness."
4068,its a pretty fun game
4069,"Wait, this isn't where I parked my car!"
4070,cold community rp is the shiznit.
4071,"This game brings the graphics and physics of Half Life 2 into a multiplayer setting, and it is truly a great marvel when you snipe someone with a revolver or throw a toilet at another player. The deathmatching is fine, but the roleplay can also be just as fun as DarkRP on GMod if you find the right server. It may be an oldie nowdays, but it is fun to come back and jump right into the action."
4072,"This is a must have game for half life fans and multiplayer fans though the game got older and i haven't seen many players get on it at all most of the servers are 0 players and its a game thats fun if you have friends to play it with,though if you are like alone have no one to play this with then its not worth the time or money this should be free to play cause no one bothers to touch it now and if it turned free im sure the servers would go back up,my point is if your expecting more players its a no so would i recommend it No...because after seeing no one on the game at all i stopped playing it and uninstalled it due to lack of players and it wasn't worth the time of day but if your a half life fan who can get people to play this then this is for you i give this game a fair chance of 5.3 out of 10"
4073,"Pretty fun I guess, I use to play it alot before Garry's Mod came out. It has all diffrent kinds of gamemodes. There's regular deathmatch, co-op, roleplay, and build"
4074,pretty good. kinda fun
4075,Nice game. Just am not good at deathmatch style games. (Guess it's because I get killed off almost  at once!)
4076,"Best online game, Fuck CS:GO, you can kill people with toilets its ridiculous 11/10"
4077,"Really fun with friends. Simple and the maps are fairly good. If it had more official support, I feel as though it'd have a larger fanbase though."
4078,"This game has an excellent, albeit older community behind it. Gameplay is fast, and extremely entertaining!"
4079,great game
4080,"its a ok game, but its been ruined by the modern gaming community of shooter games, all dem CoD lag switchers and stuff are here, when i first got it, my latency was over 1000 :/ i thought it would be fun, but i am having trouble enjoying it, just like gmod multiplayer, i cant enjoy it, and the waiting times becuase everyone has to have custom files, jsut start a game on a defualt map and play gawd dangit :( i knew i shouldnt have listened to a 3 yr old review, i couldve gotten like, terraria or something with the $5 i spent"
4081,Half Life 3 Confirmed!
4082,"Pretty fun game its similar to the first HL deathmatch, with the addition of the HL2 wepons on other players. The maps are open ended and theres alot of room for all out battles in any part of the map. Taking from arena shooters like the previous game, items are scattered around the map some in great places to abuse the re-spawn, others not so much but you get by. 

The majority of the games servers however are saddly empty. When getting a server list youll find that it will only get about 20 servers of wich 90% of them are empty. You will still find 2 - 3 servers with about 5 - 10 players at most, if youre lucky youll find a server with about more than 10 people. Said players also use voice chat and help out new  players but be warned that these people are the same players that have been on this game since the old days when the servers on this game were populted, so going against them will seem very tough. 

Still its a very nice deathmatch game, if you are a fan of the HL series and like deathmatch games this wouold be a nice addition to pick up. Keeping in mind the points that ive previously mentioned theres always the chance there are still players in quite a few number of servers."
4083,"This Deathmatch type version of Half-life is a blast. It's fast paced and fun for anyone.
"
4084,"Get smashed with a toilet! Get blown by a RPG, and get shot down with SMG, it's Deathmatch time! grab your weapon or die trying! very fun once you get into it! 8/10"
4085,really fun but servers are dead. Play it with friends-
4086,Fun but outdated :/
4087,Half-Life 2: Deathmatch is amazing with friends you can solve puzzles on servers or get beat by your friend at chess for the 100th time because he is a pro but aside from all that it is relly fun to go on servers and do stuff you would not think about overall it's a good experience you and your friends can enjoy together i would give this an 8/10 and recommend to buy this game.
4088,Horribly unbalanced. You get the best gun and you win until everyone starts going after you at once.
4089,"I cant Go on to how much of my Childhood i put into this Game , Carrying a laptop where ever to play this game on Low at about 15-28 Fps .
Yup Childhood."
4090,"A great idea in theory, less so in practice. Half life 2 deathmatch is actually a fun game. but the lack of players (and decent servers) are frusturating. If you can find a good server the game is actually fun! very fast paced, and very difficult to learn. still reccomend it, though you may have to search for that special server. try using zoosk."
4091,If you liked Half-life 2 I bet you will like the half life 2 deathmatch.Its a game where you can battle AI's and players in half life 2 and compete being the combine or the rebels.Its just like a background story for Half life 2  only that its just you versus people.
4092,"I won a match by throwing toilets toward my oponents.
11/10."
4093,Just the best and nothing can replace it. Too bad valve dosn't make anything but VR games anymore :*(
4094,"""You killed me!""
""You shot me in the face with a Toilet Seat!""

""No the Lazer-mine that killed me - sent that toilet seat into your face""

""oh, good times""

""Yo I just killed somone with a milk Carton!"""
4095,A fun way to wait for hl3
4096,"Great game, highly recommended!"
4097,"Heyyo, lots of hours of grav gun and other weapons to be had in this. I've always enjoyed a good deathmatch game on this."
4098,Fastpaced and entertaining!! A must have!
4099,Very very very very very fun :)
4100,you can kill with toilets
4101,"this game is very buggy but 
very fun to play and i love how you can 
just move stuff around and hit people with it"
4102,"Valve are cheap, really cheap. They tell fans they do this to make it cheaper but the grand total outweighs the average Triple A game prices."
4103,Spent way too much of my life playing this game. Yet i do not regret a single thing about that.
4104,Some of the most fun maps you will play next to Quake 3: Arena.
4105,It's fun. May be biased because this was my first game on Steam though.
4106,"Back in the day, this shit was free if u had an ati or nvida graphics card........ this game is still fuckin awesome."
4107,"Didn't get a chance to play HL2 Deathmatch until last year but I was pleasantly surpised to find a ton of people still into this game. I've spent at least a dozen late nights with this game and it's a very nice change of pace from the more ""serious"" shooters like CoD or CS. I say give it a shot."
4108,love it
4109,"It's basically Counter-Strike with Half-Life 2 weapons. I personally don't like it, but hey - it's ok from technical and mechanical point of view."
4110,"With the SOURCE game engine and all the weapons of Half-Life 2, set into a total multiplayer type, Half-Life 2: Deathmatch was my favorite FPS. I've logged almost 70 hours, and each one was well worth it. It's also free if you have an NVidia gfx chip, so get it now! Well worth it. The most versatile FPS I've ever played, with gamemodes from DM/TDM to Deathrun and freebuild, with server mods to play like Garry's Mod. 6 stars out of 5."
4111,alright. honestly didnt play this game for long but oh well... basic HL2 combat but... against other people?
4112,"I will never get tired of this game!
"
4113,garbage
4114,"Recommended, but not as motivating gameplay as TF2 has in the team oriented design."
4115,"Meh, Standard deathmatch. to be honest i'd save my money and buy ethier Gmod, Of play Team Fotress 2 instead. If you want to have fun, kill people, and enjoy the Half Life 2 engine, Get gmod/TF2. It's this and a hundred more thing to do besides standard death match.Plus, TF2 is well more polished with additional gammode, classes, weapons, and FUN."
4116,Great game!
4117,Love this game :D
4118,Eu recomendo
4119,People waste their lives on this
4120,Needs more players.  So buy this game.
4121,"I love HL2 Deathmatch. Few things are  as rewarding as killing someone with a flying toilet.  There is something special about the weapons of this game. The cross bow feels right and has satisfying kills, or to be killed by the Energy Orb ( what my friends and I like to call the “Fuzzy Ball”). 
Love Love Love this game. Wishing there were a Half Life 3 Deathmatch. :)"
4122,Great game wrote this review for the xp.
4123,"A really fun game! It's kind of old at the time of writing this review though, but if you can find a server with people on it, it is a very enjoyable game. You just screw around, shoot, defy gravity, and have fun! Like I said though it's old at this point."
4124,"Realy FUN!

BUY THIS!"
4125,Good time and easy for play!
4126,Great game!
4127,Go hard or go home
4128,"No achievements, no markets, no DLCs or any other BS that is an essential part of many games these days and is fairly pointless. Pure old-school (not so old tho, but old enough) with flying toilet-bowls among other moveable objects thrown in yo face that can be used as a weapon thanks to the gravity gun. It's a shame not many play it these days, I wish it were 2004 again with hundreds of servers full."
4129,The Best Game DM!!!BEST!
4130,"Needs more updates...

Bug:
-To change your Combine skin,you need to use the console."
4131,"Takes the amazing Half Life 2 and puts it in an amazing, chaotic, multiplayer.There is no shop for weapons or membership, everyone is equal in firepower.I would definitely recommend it to fans of the Half Life series.
"
4132,badass! one of the best Death Match type games IMO. The Gravity Gun really adds something different. Nothing like takin someone out with a toilet to the dome!
4133,"Write a review for Half-Life 2: Deathmatch

Please describe what you liked or disliked about this game and whether you recommend it to others.
Please remember to be polite and follow the Rules and Guidelines."
4134,Classic!
4135,Fun multiplayer
4136,Some of the most fun I've ever had was with a gravity gun!
4137,"Don't buy this game if you have weak Graphics card and slow network or you'll fucked up. Small amount of player in Deathmatch server. why people make Roleplay gamemode in this game? the title is ""Deathmatch""."
4138,"The server admins have the most absurd reasons to ban players.
When they ban everybody, they don't have to wonder, why this game has so few players.
Bigoted, lonely souls, who misunderstand the concept of a SHOOTER game:
""You are not allowed to shoot this way. Ban!""

But the game itself is incredibly fun. Killing with gravity gun in multiplayer...
Imagine how HL3: dm will be!! omg."
4139,"much fun, great to spend time"
4140,I can't believe this game ripped off half life 2 so much that they even stole the name -10/10000000
4141,"Half-Life 2 ripoff, I can't belive anyone would even play this crap. 0/0."
4142,You can throw toilets at people ^_^
4143,This game is all time classic.....
4144,reKt
4145,Best gameplay for me is RolePlaying This game is made for RP :d
4146,sweet spaghetti tits batman this game is fun
4147,"Cool Game , Good If you are looking for something that is exiting and makes you to laugh loudly and say ""F*** Yeah !"".
This game is good for you then :D
Worth to buy actully now with this low price ."
4148,Awesome game. 100% more awesome when playing with friends.
4149,"yes
"
4150,"A beautiful Half life Family addition. This game kept me entertained for years and will continue for years more, if anyone was ever on the damn thing 10/10"
4151,"Just HL2 online, lots of fun and lots of maps, the only problem is that there are really few people that play this game. It's source engine, so runs even on a toaster. Buy it if you want to play something different, give it a try. Watch out though, players that you will run into are usually rather skilled and it could get pretty frustrating at times. It takes a bit to get the hang of it but every moment spent playing this will be worth it."
4152,Got killed by toilet 11/10
4153,good
4154,"You can kill people by throwing toilets at them with gravity guns.
Need I say more?"
4155,"It was a very good game during its time, but the community has died down a lot now."
4156,"featuring bots that can actually perform 360 noscopes with any weapon and a community that is either concerningly good at the game or clearly cheating, fun with friends but you should probably stay away from other players"
4157,It's just insanely fun.
4158,good HL2 Mode for DM
4159,"You can kill people with toilets.

9/10"
4160,its good
4161,dead game
4162,a fun arena shooter
4163,die
4164,"Still better then Call of Duty.
11/10."
4165,Thi game is really fun. Highly underrated.
4166,"I killed someone by shooting a toilet at them.

10/10"
4167,It's literally a tacked on afterthought multiplayer mode that costs money.
4168,Great game
4169,"good game
agent blows"
4170,I love this game....
4171,Pretty Cool Game!
4172,"this game is like a mystery box, you never know what each server is going to hold or who you are going to kill or get killed by. just pure, mindless killing and I love it. and for such a good game, it is highly underestimated so I recommend everyone and their family to get this game and keep it alive #kony2012"
4173,Can throw already thrown grenades and toilets. 10/10.
4174,Good one.
4175,Broke my christian values
4176,Freaking awesome game.
4177,I reccomend this game because it's really fun and action filled. This game is awesome
4178,Mods and guns and stuff 10/10
4179,"I fucking love this game!
"
4180,"Tried it, it's okay"
4181,Its fun but it can get repetitive and boring. I am mainly recommending it because it enhances Garry's Mod.
4182,SICK GAME
4183,It's too old now! Don't buy it
4184,its in the half life 2 series END OF STORY!
4185,it good game if you're the real
4186,Great game and excellent support for low quality systems. This was the only game that ran on my laptop.
4187,10/10 10 years later
4188,"So I joined a roleplaying server that took about 10 minutes to join as there were tons of assets. Anyways I got banned within a couple seconds and may or may not have placed a spray in the middle of town that may or may not have been “inappropriate”. Regardless calling admin abuse fuck this game I’m never playing again. This game comes bundled with Half-Life 2 Ep. 1 or you could be a distrubed individual and buy this on its own. I honestly don’t understand why people still play this game when literally any other multiplayer game exists and literally any other multiplayer game is better. I would rather get caught playing Fortnite or Clash of Clans then this stupid old game that wasn’t ever really that fun in the first place. 

+Only $5
+For some reason people still play it 
+It’s Half-Life 2 weapons but PVP what do you expect it to be
+Can prop kill people
+Kill people by throwing a toilet at them
+Various servers and gamemodes
+Some cool mods and customs assets
+Sprays :)
+Can change your character
+VR support????
+Bots
+Stun stick

-Existing
-I keep getting sniped half away across the map WTF
-So many people who play this game are so tryhard like buddy, this game came out 17 years ago and has less than 30 people playing on average RELAX!!!
-Every server has tons of custom mods and assets which means every server takes about 5+ minutes to load into. Gmod all over again
-Several servers are actually empty and have fake players in it to trick you into joining
-Bots like to get stuck or just never shoot anyone. Some maps they will all get stuck in the same spot which is just like bruuh
-This game has VR support apparently which is odd anyways the game keeps loading up SteamVR each time I load the game up even though I don’t even have my VR plugged in and VR mode disabled in game
-Nobody talks I keep trying to have conversations with these cucks and nobody says anything but accusing one another of hacking or have a disliking towards my spray

This game when it first came out I can understand playing but, 17 years later I just don’t understand why people would still play this when Warzone, Fornite, Apex, Destiny, TF2, CSGO, etc. exist. Why play Half-Life 2 PVP. Like the famous Hank Hill said “Something ain’t right with people who still play Half-Life 2 Deathmatch in 2021+” Just get Gmod instead honestly lol

"
4189,solid
4190,"12/10, would bang."
4191,This game os awesome and coming back the servers are finnally full and the Roleplay is the best. (BETTER THEN GMOD) Check out KA-RP server iy is the best
4192,"Cut people in half with saw blades.

10/10"
4193,By far my best steam investment
4194,"This game is great multiplayer fun! Would recommend it to anyone who want to throw toilets, central heaters, razorblades, pick-up carts, wheels, supermarket carts and much more at their friends and enemies!"
4195,MAYBE LOVE
4196,good game
4197,its very fun to play and i enjoy the gameplay so much! theres not alot of servers though that have people.
4198,this game is sick
4199,"Should've written a review for this long long ago, But everything about this game was pure joy. the gameplay is solid and has stood the test of time. But I would say be wary of purchasing this title now. This is due to the community slowing down, now you won't have trouble finding a match but a lot of what made me love this game and sink my life into it is gone.

Regardless worth a buy, do it."
4200,It's okay.
4201,"great idea, shitty game"
4202," I got a double kill by shooting a urinal across the map!

11/10 will shoot more urinals again!"
4203,"Moment of fun is when you got killed by pros.

This game teaches you to react fast against enemies activities. They would camp near your spawn site and assault. However, this can be prevent by strategies. As there has Team Deathmatch mode, you can act before the enemy did. Kill them with laser guided rocket laucher, trigger Satchel Charge before they enter the waypoint or you even could kill them with flying sink!"
4204,"This game is a hidden gem among the deep heart of steam's heart.
Half Life 2 Deathmatch throws all the HL2 weapons and throws you in an amazing selection of maps to fight in.
This game is the lovely old deathmatch styled games. You either kill, or be killed! No hiding like games nowdays. You are the man, the badass, the Shit. Skill is everything, not some weapon you need to buy for 5 dollars.
Half Life 2 Deathmatch takes the badassness to the next level. You get to throw toilet bowls at each other with the gravity gun and get to time frags like a boss.
Sadly, the fans of deathmatches aren't as popular as the past. So recommend this piece of badassery to your friends.
10/10 Can shoot toilet bowls"
4205,A very good FPS game. Totally worth it my money. I'm happy that I bought this game. If you like games like Counter Strike BUY it you won't regret it.
4206,SO MUCH CROWBAR.
4207,"I got this game for free from Steam, it was one of the very first games i had on Steam. I would recommand this game to anyone. Ive met some great gamers and made friends thru this game!"
4208,A very underrated multiplayer FPS!
4209,"i don't fucking know man. I mean, it's got guns and you can kill little kids seconds after they spawn.

5/10 I guess. idk."
4210,good game can't wait for half life 3
4211,"What is there really to say? One of the best deathmatch experiences ever. I still enjoy playing this 9 years after release.

This game spawned the Rivetdrunk Terror Squad (RDTS). dm_overwatch is awesome. That is all."
4212,Gravity gun at its finest! 8/10
4213,"throw toilets
use the force"
4214,I recommend this game.
4215,"This is the reason why I have steam. It still works on my old laptop, even though it spits dust when I start it, and the hamsters spinning on their wheels are tired. Pretty good game engine for its time, complete with a command line interface to do all sorts of fun things with. GET IT. GET IT NAOW."
4216,takes some gettin used to but if you play cs alot then you should have no problem addapting!
4217,killed friend with toilet. best game ever
4218,"Not many players on the servers nowadays but overall,it's competitive and a ton of fun to play."
4219,Best FPS ever!!!
4220,Good game to kill shit with
4221,"It's like unreal tournament.
but with gravity guns."
4222,"It's an okay Multiplayer FPS, but I like the first Deathmatch better, just wish the first one had as much players as this game does.

I like this game."
4223,yes
4224,"A wonderful, amazing and great multiplayer game"
4225,"The only great thing about this is the gravity gun, which unfortunetly gets really old really fast. It's pretty much useless in multiplayer unless everyone else is using only the Gravity Gun. I absolutely loved Half Life 2 but just cant say the same for the Deathmatch. There are many other better multiplayers better than this."
4226,"community is dead, but with friends its like garrys mod without cheats"
4227,hi!
4228,"Not many servers around to play on, but the ones that still exist are a real joy.

So... do you guys have a toilet to spare ? :))"
4229,4/5
4230,"very cooll
"
4231,"Its fuckin' awesome like another Half Life's !
"
4232,;)
4233,"Using  the gravity gun is EPİC! Pick up whatever you want, and throw it at the enemy.Great way to maintain anger !"
4234,Whole lot of YUP!
4235,....Kinda Sucks
4236,"Pretty good game, bare bones and with few maps, but the abilty to play with bots in servers is good and it's a good game to just pick up and play."
4237,Nice.
4238,the game when i go to join the abuse me map it say i am in incure mode what does that mean?
4239,"tons of fun, grams of lag"
4240,I got this with a bundle I don't see any use to this.
4241,"Very fast paced and very fun, but if your not as experienced as others, you may pay the price.

9/10"
4242,"Meh, it's ok."
4243,"Throw toilets at your foes.
10/10"
4244,"this is an awesome game worth your money
"
4245, J0U
4246,plz make it controller compatable
4247,Fun especially multiplayer
4248,nothing beat gravity gun in multiplayer style !
4249,60/100
4250,A well designed and innovative competitive shooter.
4251,"An absolutely amazing game if your playing dm, coop or puzzle maps. Such a shame that more people dont play this game..."
4252,Got murdered by a flying plate 10/10 would be murdered by flying plates again.
4253,Now there arent that many servers but still a great game if you like throwing office equipment and grenades
4254,"















epic"
4255,"This is a great game.
Why?
Good deathmatch - oldschool like.
Where else can you kill people by launching toilets at them?
Only in HL2DM
10/10"
4256,"A brilliant extension of Half Life 2 which is what HL2 lacked, a multiplayer component. Assuming it isn't currently dead, the game used to be the joy of many fans."
4257,"I don't play this very often anymore, but it is definitely worth trying out if you're a huge Half-Life fan like me. I rate this game 7/10."
4258,"played for hours and hours with friends, still a classic and will be"
4259,you can throw a bathtub at someone 10/10
4260,more like a game to play one on one with a friend not with others you dont know because i got killed like every 30 secs or i just suck at the game
4261,Typical deathmatch game but with gravity guns!!!!!
4262,There is nothing quite as satisfying as killing your enemies with a toilet.
4263,This game has so many layers
4264,swag
4265,This game sucks now.  It gets filled with pestering little brats that use Aim Bot.  VAC can't detect it.  They claim to be skilled and heckle people that claim they are using aimbot (which they are) and then they just keep doing it.  Stupid gamers in this game now.  Years ago it was great.  There were hacks but Valve swiftly banned them.
4266,"In addition to having very few servers with more than five people playing at a time, you will spend 90% of your time downloading custom server files, and the rest of the time realizing that the servers you join, even though advertised as deathmatch, are playing some indescribable and unplayable version thereof in awful maps. This was a complete waste for something that could have been a lot of fun and provided countless hours of gameplay. If there was ever an actual game here, it has been long dead. Half-Life 2: Deathmatch is a disappointment and disaster!

Half-Life 2: Deathmatch is bad."
4267,the memories. if u r 10 plai dis
4268,Love this game!
4269,Sweet Game. Many Hours of fun. Its a classic. That pretty much sums it up for me.
4270,Lav dis game. haves good grafiks plos lats of roning an shootig an fun.
4271,Boring
4272,Throw a toilet at another man.
4273,Excellent game. I'm talking top notch
4274,"I think this game is very good and if you will have a great time with it if you have or have not played any of the other half life games
"
4275,its good
4276,This was a great game it really brought the Half life game One and Two to online of rebullions vs the Combine soliders
4277,Great game
4278,Really fun 10/10.
4279,Here's something better. Start up Garry's Mod. Set up sandbox server. Choose map. Run around with HL2 weapons and kill each other. There.
4280,"I've owned this game for ages, my first game on Steam actually that I got for free during an NVIDIA promotion. I still enjoy it today, the puzzle servers are great!"
4281,"One of the most unique PvP games i have ever played.
The gravity gun makes the whole gameplay different to any other game!
I hope to see HL3 soon and hopefully with HL3 - Deathmatch.

The graphics have now aged and not many people still playing
on the servers like there ware when i played this everyday.
Its been a few years, but still a fun game!"
4282,Best game ever created
4283,"Why do they call it deathmatch when I didn't turn into a giant flaming match"""
4284,"Half-Life 2: Deathmatch is a game that takes the weapons, environments, and game mechanics from Half-Life 2 and puts them into a PvP multiplayer game. If you couldn't tell by the title of the name, Half-Life 2: Deathmatch puts you into the boots of either a Rebel or a Combine soldier and you fight the opposing team to the death. All of the weapons from Half-Life 2 are in this game, including the Gravity Gun. So, yes, you can pick up a toilet and launch it at your enemy to kill them. You will start with a set of weapons usually consisting of a pistol, SMG, stunstick, and Gravity Gun. You will have to go searching for your other weapons including the shotgun, crossbow, magnum, and AR 2.  You can also pick up the weapon that your dead foe was using when they died. If they dropped a weapon you already have, it will be given as ammo for that weapon. Ammo, health, and suit chargers will also be scattered throughout the map. Be sure pick up those as you go. (Using health and suit chargers may leave you out in the open, so be careful of enemies.) The core character mechanics from Half-Life 2 also make a return, the only difference being that your character moves a little faster. That means that shooting while sprinting is still a thing. While it may be a bit cheap, it's still a game mechanic to be exploited. That also means that the game is a lot more fast-paced and frantic then most multiplayer FPS games on the market such as Call of Duty or Battlefield. (Note: I don't hate these two game series. So, shut up.) The maps in this game are based off of areas in Half-Life 2. While most aren't ripped straight from the game, I feel like maps like Lockdown is ripped right from Nova Prospekt, a level in Half-Life 2. There's also tons of people still playing this game. Though most servers may have bots, that shouldn't stop you from enjoying this game. Overall, Half-Life 2: Deathmatch is a really fun multiplayer game. It's currently only $14.99 on Steam. You also don't need a very powerful computer to run it. So, go check it out."
4285,Your typical deathmatch...in HL2 style! Great game but a little hard to find servers with low ping to play in for my location(Asia).
4286,BEST Game EVER!!!!!
4287,most fun i have had a great game would recomend srongly
4288,Half-life 2 but it's multiplayer
4289,"Gets stale fast fun for a while, more so with friends, but ultimately the lack of weapon variety inevitable war for the rocket launcher, and clan based servers make this a quickly burnt out game."
4290,It's the best.
4291,A really fun game to play with your friends
4292,"i got really fusterated fast ._. the spawns are so broken, the servers are almost all rp (role play) or empty, if ur new to the game u will get frickn bashed b the veterns. unless you enjoy getting spawned killed and rping i guess u could enjoy :/ the one really postiive thing is most kids dont play this game (or use there mic)"

Like garrys mod, but 1000 times worse. If you want to have freedom on multiplayer, play garrys mod. If you want to play half life, play half life..."
4304,"All of the robust movement and physics of Half Life 2, along with the gonzo combat of the gravity gun. What's not to like? This is the next level up from the classic Quake-style competitive gameplay. It can range from realistic combat to cartoony violence, with well-balanced weapons and nicely tweakable variables. I have been playing HL2DM for years, and it can still be as challenging as you want to make it.

Why is there still a community around this game after years of borked updates, minimal support, and no publicity? Because it really is that fun. It might get little love from Valve, but the participants are hardcore."
4305,"Really fun, but most of the time there is barely any people on the servers.

4318,Half-Life 2 deathmatch is one of the best deathmatch games ive ever played and would recomend it to everyone i meet. It has many maps to play on with your friends and enemies. Its great for the price and can be moded with ease. i would give it a thumbs up any day.
4319,"Are you seeing this because you are intrested to buy it on a sale? Don't even read further and get it right away for these few $ it is worth. Still curious? Let me explain why my hours for this game are so high.

This game has a very active modding scene who created a variety of different gamemodes. Unlike the name deathmatch tells you there is plenty of other things to do making it fun for everybody. The community is great and in many places very helpfull. They will sort out bugs you have or simply teach you how to play the game. You should definately buy this game! Expand the review to learn about its gamemodes.

[B](Team) Deathmatch[/B]
Servers : Common
Sub Types : 1v1 , Matches , Bots , Variety of gravity's , KillBox

As the name of the game indicates this is the original gamemode of the game. There are many different kinds of maps. Killbox is mainly a box where you can hit about everyone with some stuff for you to mess with. Other maps can involve a variety of sceneries (Mappers like to use there own themes instead of just City 17). There is still an active competitive scene so if your up for 1v1 matches dig around and you can surely find them. Some servers often killbox like to turn the gravity down for some low gravity fun.

The gunplay is what i call ""Unbalanced"". This means that some guns are clearly superior over other guns and you will have to focus on getting better weapons from the moment you spawn (Quake style but not as extreme). If this is not your thing just continue reading because there are plenty of modes for you to find.

The most populair frag video from a well known clan : http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtJgwl0EfgU

[B] Cooperative [/B]
Servers : Common
Sub Types : Exclusive maps to some servers, Multiple gravities, Exclusive Weapons to some servers, Dual Coop

This is my personal favorite mode. Infact i like this mode so much i built an entire [url=http://www.bouncyball.eu/play]server[/url] around it.

In cooperative maps you work together with your team to destroy the aliens of the singleplayer game (Combines are broken). Additionaly some of the maps give you challenges similair to the physics puzzles in the original game or allow 2 teams to mix cooperative with the deathmatching (Both examples are rare as most maps are normal cooperative).

Here is some uncut gameplay from my server to give an incidation of what the gamemode is like : http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxjxStzUAv4


[B] Puzzle [/B]
Servers : Common

The name says it all. You are put in a map where you have to complete a set of puzzles in order to beat the map.
The puzzles you get a very varied and can involve anything from finding a path in a minefield , driving airboats along a track , building your way to the exit or hitting targets with a specified gun. Puzzle map creators are very creative in the challenges they think up so each map will have its own unique challenges to beat.

Puzzle map gameplay : http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUVN46I_TYw


[B] Roleplay [/B]
Servers : Common

Roleplay is another fan favorite for many people of the game. It is cops and robbers style gameplay where you buy and sell your items and on alot of servers you can even buy and decorate your own house. Personally i did not play it much so my review would probabbly fall short of the possibility's in these servers.

Probabbly not the best vid : http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o54-ZKvVP8A

[B] Surf [/B]
Servers : Rare
Sub Types : With or without weapons (With is more common)

Surf is something adopted from the counterstrike community. It all involves trying to surf down a track of slidey walls and not falling of the sides. On most maps depending on where you failed you get placed in a deathmatch box with a better weapon then those who failed before you.

Surf Gameplay : http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GuexNobUAS0

[B] Trick Jumping [/B]
Servers : Medium Rare

These maps are similair to Surf in the way that you are trying to get from A to B. They mostly do not involve gunplay of any kind. Instead of sliding along walls you have to beat jumps of increasing difficulty. While fun on its own this is also often used to train for better movement in the deathmatches.

Hard Trickjump Gameplay : http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dEeuAHpI9l8

[B] Zombiemod [/B]
Servers : Rare
Sub Types : Hybrd with zombie survival , Straight up killing

While there are zombiemod servers they are not always around as these servers run different modes and the type of zombiemod also depends strongly on the server you play it on. Other servers usually have a bigger deathmatch focus and no npc's but since i only play it on mine i will tell you how it goes on our server.

The round starts with everyone as a survivor where you fight unlimited npc zombies in a set time. Once someone fails and greats beaten he will join the other team and only have a crowbar. Zombies are slower then survivors by default but are the only team that can use the spint ability. Survivors win by surviving long enough while zombies win by making sure all humans are dead.

In case you want to play it and no other servers are running zombiemod you can join our server [url=http://bouncyball.eu/play]bouncyball[/url] and vote for one of the zombiemod maps using !jb.

[B] Deathrun [/B]
Servers : Rare

In deathrun one team tries to run from A to B and the other sets off traps to stop them. There are a vareity of maps all with there own set of traps.

Gameplay from the most populair deathrun server : http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UYEpKmfEAz8

[B] Scripting / Cheating / Building [/B]
Servers : Rare
Sub Types : Cheating , Building using server commands only
Wait what? Cheating? Hacking? o.O
Why would anyone want to do this?

The answer is simple. Using cheats and ""Hacks"" very cool stuff can be done in the engine. Do not expect these servers to be overrun with aimbotters (although some people will kill your godmode protection off). This is all about creating great things with the cheats in the game or your own custom addons.

Sadly all good videos of this have been removed but a quick summery of some stuff i saw : Giant Mechs (Working) , Space invaders remade , Dokuman attack , gm_flatgrass turned into a forest , Gigantic volcano jump challenge that will explode in a cool manner when beaten.

The possiblity's are HUGE!

[B] Conclusion [/B]
I probabbly missed alot of gamemodes as these are server experiments. Think about FreezeTag or extremely modified servers.

The server in this video has been remade entirely and most of the things shown are no longer there but it is a good indication of how crazy the game can get : http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCmgRmg92Yo.

It is also worth mentioning that as you can see in the above vid servers have a lot of control over the gameplay as they can program new features themselfs using the addon support for the game. Think about things such as statistics , jetpacks ropes and hooks , teleports , midget mode and many more.

I hope my insiders view gave you a good insight in why this game is so well loved as the steam store page simply does not cut its job. The game has its drawbacks that in the past it has been ruined by valve quite a bit (And then fixed by valve and the community for the most part). Because valve does not look at this game very often the description and screenshots on the storepage are simply acient and you can experience some bugs and crashes. The more populair servers will do anything they can to provide a sollid gameplay experience so no worries."
4320,best game ever. that is all.
4321,"Honestly I have played so many hours in this game on my friends profile when it came out. Gosh, this was the game to play. I cant even tell you how fun it was to play some of the COOP game maps people came out with, and puzzle maps! Really what a blast.

If you were thinking about buying this now, Dont. (not even if its on sale)

The game has past its prime now. Fantastic game but, if you are looking for something similar to this buy Garrys Mod."
4322,You basically throw toilets at people.
4323,"Half Life 2 doesn't include a multiplayer mode but this bundled game sorts this out. This is not a serious multiplayer game but some great fun and has some great mods for it,including maps,skins,weapons,modes everything.What really makes this game unique is the physics in the game. Since in the game you use Half Life 2's weapons including the gravity gun so you can fire objects including toilets at your enemies

8.6/10"
4324,this game is one of the funnest games ever best ffa game out there but one thing most people are really good at the game best $5 ive ever spent well worth it some similarities to gmod
4325,"Awesome. Pure, fun multiplayer like games used to be!! Loads of people still play it. If you haven't got it yet then your missing out!"
4326,"When it was free, it was a great deal. It came with Portal and is a fun game for the time it was made back in November 30, 2004. This game is really fun, ran with the same engine (Source) as Garry's Mod, Half Life 2 (Every Part), Counter Strike (not sure which one), and a few other great games by Valve. The graphics are good for being made in 2004, and the gameplay aspect is really fun with a friend to voice chat with. There is a variety of gamemodes (Back in 2004 there was only Deathmatch where users battled it out) but now the game has fishing, dodgeball, and many others. I would recommend Garry's Mod but if you want a cheaper equivalent get Half-Life 2: Deathmatch. Recommended for users looking for a fun game to play with friends. I think most people who own Garry's Mod should have a copy of this!"
4327,Awesome for the average modder.
4328,It's really fun but not so much now
4329,Wheres Gordon?
4330,i would recommend this game. its a good shooter and never gets boring
4331,"Uhhh, its ok but ill try to get more into the game to see if i like it or hate it
"
4332,All I know for this one is deathrun.
4333,oh yes
4334,Perhaps The greatest Fps of all time. Excellent game system. Grav gun and nade catch will be something you will rmemeber fondly well into old age.
4335,Wish more played this.
4336,"This multiplayer game is easy to play, and hard to master, wich is why it is one of the best. You dont have to have too much skill to be good, but having skill will defiantly help boost your score.
This game is just pure fun. Unlike other multiplayer shooters, there is no ranking, so there is no punisment for loosing, and no reward for winning. You can just goof around in a server if you want to. Diffrent severs have diffrent rules which makes each time you play unique. This game is best played with your friends over lan.
The weapons in this game are all the same from half life 2 ( including the Gravity Gun ). Each weapon has a diffrent purpose and learing how to use each weapon with efficancy is the key to mastering this game. The gravity gun just adds to to the amount of fun this game is."
4337,GOOD GAME :3
4338,"Hands down the best first person shooter ever put out. The mobility that this game offers players is unmatched in any other fps to date, the community is great, there are lots of well developed maps, everything is more or less balanced and most importantly, this game takes real skill to play."
4339,1/2 life^2= 1/4 life
4340,LOVE THIS GAME! Bit underplayed npw but great with friends! Here's a short funny clip of us playing it! https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CAolWgcKlwM
4341,"Easiest way to sum it up is The Doctor's quote: ""Blink and you're dead"". This game is quick. Insanely quick. And insanely amazing. I wish more people played this so the server variety was better. But nonetheless, +1"
4342,Fun
4343,Oldie but goddie this game has great physics and weapons balance.  Deathmatch with the right crew is fun for days
4344,"I´m addicted, and thats a fact."
4345,"This is a great game, but don't buy it if you have an old AMD AThlon XP 3000+ cpu, because due to a recent game update, it won't work anymore for many people.  We suspect that it now requires a cpu with SSE2 support, which was not included in the old cpus, which worked fine until the update.  The requirement for SSE2 is not listed in the game requirements which would be helpful."
4346,fun game . definately worth $5
4347,This is a fun game to play with your friends.
4348,i love this game get it it is worth it
4349,"You can use the Gravity Gun in online death matches, I think that says it all."
4350,"I remember having so much fun tossing toilets at people 6 years ago. I've got some nostalgia bias in there, but I have to say the game is pretty fun.
(I lost my old steam account which had a lot of game time on HL2DM)"
4351,nice game
4352,"OOOOOOOH SHIT NIGGA DIS GAME TIGHT AS A MOTHA FUCKIN SUSPENSION BRIDGE YOU PICK UP TOILETS SHOOT DUDES WITH THEM HAHAHAHAH LOVE IT

11/11"
4353,"This game is awesome. It really worth the money. You can choose between Deathmatch, Team Deathmatch, Co-Op, Revolution  Co-Op and some others I don't remember now. This game it's perfect for a quick  visit to the PC. Surprisingly, this game was free 2-3 years ago, but Valve decided to take our money. I don't care anymore, I've buyed this game, and I'm happy. Buy it,it has a lot of maps and modes!"
4354,this game is stale bread
4355,"This was the first game I turned on when buying the Half-Life series on sale (just 1, 2, and this).  As soon as I got onto a server (minus the painstaking wait of downloading the effects), I wet my pants from laughter.  

     The gravity gun is all it takes to make this game a gem.  If you want to have a gut-busting deathmatch by chucking explosive barrels and toilets at enemies for kills (don;t worry, there are guns, too), this is your type of game."
4356,5 MINUTES?!?!? YES I CAN WRITE A REVIEW OF IT THEN!
4357,"eye liek 2 kill ppl,"
4358,5 euros u srs valve C'est FREEEEEEE
4359,Worst Games EVAAAR!
4360,"Great game,"
4361,"I will recommend this game to you because it is a great mod for killing people in half-life and have a challenge with no AI computer idiots in Half-Life, Half-Life 2 and Half-Life 2 Episodes. Now I know this is old for writing a review, but I really don't care what anyone thinks because I'm DIFFERENT, and I'm proud to be, so if you're starting to dislike me I really don't care. Now back to the review shall we? 
-Gameplay:
There is not bugs to offer in the game and gameplay is pretty smooth so I'm happy with this game
-Graphics:
The graphics are great for two-generation old textures.
-Score:
Now I know that my review is realitively short because a deathmatch game is just deathmatch so there's not really any features, but the score is 9.1/10. I'll give some room to improve."
4362,"This game is very fun and is great for a LAN. The graphics are great and the gameplay is awesome. The online games are challenging and a lot of fun.

The one thing I think is a drawback is having to download new maps for online games. Apart from that though, I have no other complaints."
4363,"One of my all-time favorite games.
Great laughs and great kill/death ratios."
4364,FUCKING HILARIOUS great to play with mates
4365,"Half Life 2 with others sounds like a spendid concept.

Too bad no one else is playing except two bots and some guy who's AFK.

*sigh*"
4366,"LAN PARTY Madness!!!
Nothing quite so cathartic that nailing a coworker with a toilet!"
4367,10/10 shoot people with toilets!
4368,"During a wedding reception of a young couple the guests decided on a drunken game of hide and seek. It was decided that the groom was “it” and he eventually found everyone but his new bride. Eventually the man became furious and decided it wasn’t funny anymore and left her there. As weeks went by he accepted that she’d had second thoughts and went on with her life so he did the same. A few years later a cleaning lady dusted off an old trunk in the attic of the building where the reception had taken place, out of curiosity she opened it. Inside the trunk was the rotted body of the missing bride who’d apparently became locked in the trunk she’d hid in. Whether she’d suffocated or starved was unknown, but her face was frozen in a scream and there were huge scratches in the inside of the trunk where she had tried to get back to the man she loved."
4369,its literally ruined by not having bunnyhopping. its maps are full of chokepoints and it has really lethal weapons and the movement is really slow so resource camping is a serious problem.
4370,"Awesome game to play, I highly recommend it. I'd give it 2 Thumbs up and a Hi 5!"
4371,its awesome.....i love the roleplay servers
4372,"BY GOD why would something with the word DEATHMATCH in its name have its own game? why would anyone want to buy an online multiplayer fps game that only has deathmatch? WHY? and its not even a good game. if your new to the game like i was you just get owned by everyone espesually when its in a map that hase so many openings. once you spawn YOU DIE. all u ever need is the revolver and crossbow and THATS it. there arent even any cool weapons other than the ar2(wich is useless btw) unlike the first hld (wich shouldnt have its own game either) wich had a ton of cool weapons (but thats probably because hl1 had cooler weapons then hl2) plus using the grav gun isnt gunna help u. sometimes there are servers that dont even give u the grav gun(btw good luck on trying to find a server that dosnt have crazy plugins)(just like in tf2 wich is definitely better than this game) this game shouldnt cost money its just deathmatch. it seems like it would be like a gmod special game mode. (cant say the same about the first hld). the only reason you should buy this game
is A if your buying hl comeplete wich for some reason has tf1 in it
or B so you can have all the gmod mounts
wich is both the reasons why i have this game
but its just MY OP"
4373,Best game ever.
4374,tgoof
4375,"Even after all the years this game has come out, it still has an active community and great story line.  Constant updates has helped the game stay up-to-date in graphics and help prevent it from showing it's age."
4376,"this game is BEAST
"
4377,This game is really mental but fun. You can toss pretty much anything with the Gravity Gun and I think this is what was missing from the orignial Half-Life 2 game. But never the less I recommend buying this game for ever lasting fun! (And because it's only £2.99)

4399,So many games do deathmatch better than this game. If you like deathmatch in the half-life world then it's worth a look. Otherwise there's better deathmatch style games out there.
4400,Good game. Good series. Worth every penny.
4401,"This game, after you've played counter strike for example, it is easier. Being an easier game is funner for an hour straight of gaming. Love it."
4402,this game is so fun but so fuckin mental!! you just run round and shoot the shit out of people!! buy it now for ultimate fun!
4403,total waste of money
4404,minus peple just useing rocket launchers prety perfect game 9-10

4413,If you really feel the need to have a MP experience in Half Life 2 this is your game.  It looks as good as HL2 and the maps are interesting.
4414,Best game!
4415,Awesome stuff.
4416,100 hours. It's counter strike meets half life.
4417,Really nice game buy it!
4418,"No one plays this game.
DO NOT FU-CKING BUY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
4419,"I never did enjoy this.
Just played it a few times then never touched it again."
4420,"Haven't played this game in years, forgot how amazingly fun it is."
4421,"I've played this game for about 4 years since I got it. It's great! The abundance of servers that you can play on will keep you busy! Some servers better then others. I enjoy hopping on and playing some of the Roleplay servers. Even on some build servers, where you can practically build anything with Half-Life 2 props and imported models. And there are the Deathmatch servers run by communities and clans. The choices are endless for this game! I highly reccomend this game, sure it's a little old, but the communities really know how to keep you hooked!"
4422,Рекомендую
4423,Using everything you learned from Half Life 2 to kill other people in battle!
4424,Fun!
4425,NIce game. But you need to add  achievement
4426,"It's really good, yeah. You'd better play it!"
4427,Very fun if you just want to pass the time
4428,"Yeah, its good."
4429,HL2:DM is a must have. Nuff said.
4430,Really fun especially on the CO-OP servers
4431,Ahahah. No.

4436,extremly fun game
4437,Best game
4438,Best game
4439,"Best game ever, obviously."
4440,Old times :)
4441,"Perfect example that Half Life is NOT made for multiplayer.
Dated (seriously, now  it plays like ass), horribly unbalanced weapons, killing someone takes longer than it should, frustrating 1 hit Gravity Gun, Crosbow and Launcher Kills, hackers EVERYWHERE, alongside with a dying community, etc. makes this a game that I can´t honestly recommend.
If you´re in it for the deathmatch, go buy CS:GO.
If you´re in it for the roleplay, go buy GMod.
There´s no real reason to buy it nowdays."

4444,"Kinda funny,but those admins are motherf***ers"
4445,"Fun game, lots of diversity, but challenging when playing against veterans. Perfect for LAN-parties where nobody is especially good!"
4446,The only game that really matters. Buy it. Learn it. Love it.
4447,"Such guns
                Very run
    Much guns
                Wow"
4448,"The reason I started gaming. Still a classic, never bores, although never have been able to do that skipping thang!"
4449,BUY IT
4450,Very good and fun game!
4451,"Very fun. Very Very fast paced action!  Theres no breaks when your on a server.  Very balanced weapons too.

12 out of 10"
4452,lmao
4453,"Half Life 2 Deathmatch is pure chaotic fun, using the amazing half life 2 physics engine to fling items across the room to kill your opponents is a blast."
4454,"Very fast and good old Deathmatch game. Throw things on other players, use your favorite weapons from HL."
4455,Classic FPS
4456,"One of my favorite multiplayer games. I've spent over two hundred hours playing it, and playing mostly user-made maps. It was a lot of fun, though I'm sure not much is happening in servers now; it's been a long time. One things for sure, the days of custom maps are over, and if you missed them, you'll never know how much you missed. Still, give this game a shot. I'm sure you just got it with a bundle, and yeah, mostly hardcore fans will be playing. That just shows their dedication to a game worth reviving, though even I got a little frustrated the last time I played. Maybe HL3 deathmatch...too bad that will never happen."
4457,"Is good game, comrades lets keep infesting servers is good idea no lie."
4458,The best FFA game ever made.
4459,"Main attaction here is the gravity gun. Pick up whatever you please, and throw it at the enemy.

I just hope you don't buy the title for itself. Get it in a pack, so things are a little understable. Servers aren't common, as a few hours of thowing things around is good enough.

I don't really feel like giving this title a rating, as it should be purchased in a pack with HL2...

7/10 - Solid game for being a ""chuck that object at that"" simulator."
4460,Throw toilets and shit
4461,"The game itself can be a lot of fun and feel familiar for fans of classic deathmatch games like Half Life: Deathmatch or Unreal Tournament, and if played as such this game can be greatly enjoyed."
4462,"Just HL2 online, what else I needto say?"
4463,Gud game. :D
4464,"This game is a low quality game filled with low quality people.
Enjoy!"
4465,!!
4466,"This is a classic game which is still great fun, nearly 10 years on and still a thriving friendly community."
4467,"I had a lot of fun playing this game. The gravity gun adds a whole new dimension to the deathmatch game. I actually like the server system. The problem is many weapons are way too overpowered and way too many maps are just boring killboxes. For instance, the crossbow was meant to be a different way of sniping that required timing and physics logic. However in close combat the crossbow's one hit kills just make close combat not fun at all. Overall I recommend!"
4468,"Greatest game of all time! I didn't know who I was before I played this game, it has helped me get through some rough paths during my life, and I have valve to thank for making me move on."
4469,oh god why did i buy this
4470,Just buy the stupid game and play it. You won't be disappointed.
4471,"Really fun, faced paced action game. Fantastic!"
4472,"An awesome multiplayer game. Weapons are fine, movement and shooting are accurate. Though there is only a limited amount of maps in the server. I highly suggest that Steam create a software for Mac players to create their own maps. Lovable missions downloaded off the net kill off being bored. For a taste of CO-OP, download the Ant-Lion maps and play them. 9/10"
4473,its a fun game to play with your friends
4474,I recommend this for anyone who wants a fun challenge.
4475,"There is no better feeling then smashing your friend in the head with a toilet.
Worth buying simply for the Grav Gun.
"
4476,Who would I recommend this to??? Everyone this is an amazing game totally worth the money
4477,The best game I've ever played.
4478,Very fun game I mean what other game can you Toss a toilet at your friends! ITS FUN!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
4479,"I love this game, quick and fun!"
4480,"★★★☆☆ Good!

[h1]Action[/h1]

I consider this game to not really be a full-game, its more like a mod with price for Half-Life 2, but if it's a mod then its a great mod.

The guns blazing, balls crazy action of this game is just epic with the great gear of Half-Life 2 weapons at your hands. The gravity gun is the real star of this game, its so much fun blasting objects into other players. This game however, isn't a real step forward since its really buggy and it has no recoil like Half-Life 2 and it really achieves nothing but its still fun.

Overall I liked this game a lot despite some downsides, the affordable price is also another thing to consider but this game won't please everyone. You should consider this game but analyze before you buy it."
4481,Barely anyone on your friends list will be seen playing this untouched gem but theres plenty of players and many great mods. Death match at bare bones.
4482,This game is really fun. Get it.
4483,"Its Half Life 2 but it has Deathmatch...

Since you're reading this review ill tell you a quick summary about the game and what it has brought to me.

[STORY]
I first started playing this game back in 2010 first game I ever bought I didnt think it would take 
all my time, but WOW is this game still much fun packed! When i first joined and played there were
many and many fun servers to join some deathmatch, puzzles,coop, and TDM. I met the majority of my steam friends here... and enemies. 
The noob i was helplessly getting killed over and over wanted me to just leave the game but something inside of me some power hidden
told me not to quit and keep playing and boy was it right!

[Quick Game Summary as of 2016 Feb 5th]

As of now this game still has plenty of servers to join and are still much fun to play make sure you filter in the settings to Users playing in servers to have a better chance of finding Actual People in servers playing. The community of this game is very small now but everyone is nice, and helpful if you stick around long enough you will get to meet everyone , and become a regular  and make new friends. The type of game modes which are still around are Team-Deathmatch, Co-op, Puzzles,Deathrun, and Role-Play. HL2:DM still has much potential in it but the Developers just left it in the dust luckily we have very talented modders in the community who still make Beautiful maps, and amazing Pluggins for your enjoynment. For the Price of $5 this is a get right away game and play! You will need all Skills for this bad boy game no hacks,  practice on servers with bots and you will improve much more speed and accuracy for Deathmatch . Just like the good there is always the BAD you have to be careful when you play on specific servers, you will have the players and the Admins who will kick and ban for being better than them at the game. The game can be very fast paced or very slow paced for you campers depending which servers you join
some have the fast kill one shot and others have the stock settings which take a few bullets more to kill. I honestly would say i put a lot of hours into this game,  and heck? i dont think i will ever be done playing this so I urge you to buy this game and try it out for yourself It is truly a ""Classic Jewl of a FPS game."""
4484,1/2 Life 2 DM is Best fun
4485,Very fun game yes
4486,This game doesn't baby you like in Team fortress 2 so expect a fun but very challenging mulitplayer when considering buying this.
4487,good
4488,pretty nice
4489,wish ppl still played this :(
4490,10/6
4491,"Insanely fun, and simple game! :D
"
4492,Not a bad little game; it's pretty much TF2 if it were in the Half-LIfe Universe.
4493,This game used to be fun but it really is dying most servers are empty and whats left is not pretty
4494,"Deathmatch. With Half-Life 2 equipment. (!?!)
Nothing much else to say.
Game appears completely abandoned by devs.

first impression: 3/10"
4495,Nade + Gravgun = win
4496,Need this for Garrys Mod.
4497,A fun game to play with friends...but the community is slowly dying
4498,awesome!!!
4499,"The one down side to this game is that no one plays it anymore and that the revolver is OP. It’s fun to play gravity gun only throwing toilets and explosive barrels at your enemies. It’s a shame not many people play on this game anymore you’ll be lucky enough to find a few servers with people to play with. I thought the game was pretty fun but it was annoying when people master the revolver and you just keep getting 1 shotted when u spawn.  For $5 it's not bad if you can find servers. 
Throwing Toilets 5/10"
4500,ГО?
4501,"A throwback to the days where multiplayer games were neither balanced nor play-tested but they worked out just fine anyway. Fans of multiplayer maps with no gravity that end rounds with copyright-infringing uses of James Brown songs will be thrilled. If you a bit more structure to your multiplayer action, or you know, competition then this might not be your thing."
4502,"This is an Half-Life 2 Deathmatch , there are many servers in this game.
It's is fun!!!"
4503,I don't think my mom let me play this game cuz of the toilit humour
4504,"nice
"
4505,"One of the strangest, funnest multiplayer games I've played"
4506,"You must play this old game at least once in your life. Why? Because it is made by Valve. I mean, perfection."
4507,"Half-Life 2: Deathmatch is the multiplayer component of Half-Life 2. It comes packed with all the classic weapons from Half-Life 2, and it includes two weapons that were cut from the main game: the Combine Stunstick, and the SLAM. Great multiplayer game, really action packed; and the fact that you can either play a full deathmatch game, or recreate the game battles with the Team Deathmatch mode (which puts the Rebels against the Combine) makes it a complete experience."
4508,"While Entertaining For A Little While, Half Life 2: Deathmatch Doesn't Have All That Much To It. It's Core Mechanics Are Solid, With A Slower Movement Speed Than Half Life 1, All Weapons Except For The Pistol Being Extra Lethal, And The Absolutely Amazing Gravity Gun Differentiating The Game From It's Contemporaries. Aside From It's Base Mechanics However, The Game's Very Lean On Content. Only Free For All And Team Deathmatch, No CTF Or Objective Modes, And Simple Combine And Rebel Player Models. If You Really, And I Mean REALLY, Like Half Life 2, Get It. If Just Deathmatch And Team Deathmatch Doesn't Sound Like Enough For You, Get Garrys Mod. This Comes Bundled With Half Life 2 Episode 1 And With The Orange Box, So On Second Thought, Just Get One Of Those Instead Of Buying This By Itself"
4509,"any time you can kill someone with a flying toilet, deffently means you have a fun game"
4510,It's Good...
4511,Great game until everyone stopped playing it and went to garrys mod
4512,"Stop trying to copy GMOD Valve
"
4513,"I like to play a game where is so much spam
And it's not so very hard to do
The name of the game is HL2:Deathmatch
And I would like for you to play it too
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gvzHGYSv8kw"
4514,"Słowem - rozwałka :)
Gra za darmo, sama przyjemność."
4515,It used to be a great game with tons of veterans but it has just gone to shit. Thank Valve for their updates.
4516,"At only $5 Half-Life 2 Death Match is a no-brainer. Whether you are a Half-Life fan to begin with, or just a fan of online shooters, the game is simple, outrageous fun. It's easy to jump into, but remains entertaining even after hours of play. The player-base is great, and there's always several matches available to hop into for Team play or FFA. Buy it and start launching toilets and barrels at your friends today."
4517,Yep people are still playing it. Best weapons set ever.
4518,"Full of bugs and glitches also Valve ""updates"" it regularly which breaks even more than it fixes.
I cannot recommend this game. Enough."
4519,"This game taught me details of Source engine which is something I used in every other Valve game, thank you for this, game.

10/10"
4520,"If you already own Half-Life 2, the extra 5 bucks for this is ABSOLUTELY WORTH IT (perhaps even more so than Episode 1).  I've, again, begun writing a recommendation for a game without playing it TOO much, but I'm already having a blast in the Team Deathmatch gamemode:  Combine team vs. rebels, you are automatically assigned to one or the other, and then chaos ensues.  Not the dismayed and confused chaos; the ""IDKWTF IS HAPPENING BUT IT'S FREAKIN' AWESOME"" kind of chaos.  One of the most jolting parts I've experienced is when I randomly respawn as part of the opposite team, and it takes me a few disorienting seconds to figure out that I'm shooting at the wrong players entirely.  I mean this all in a good way.  Basically, get this game because: A) It's Half-Life 2, but MULTIPLAYER.  HALF-LIFE 2 MULTIPLAYER. nuff said.  B) Only $4.99  C) It's just a ""wild ride"".  I can't think of any better way to end this, so I'll resort to plagiarism: Get HL2:DM, and toss a toilet at your friend today!"
4521,"If you love Half Life 2, you love this multiplayer mode too. You can fight with other players in pvp or play with them in coop, of course all in HL2 world. It's your choice what you want to do in this game :)"
4522,The most fast paced tdm I have ever seen.
4523,"Fun, but not my favorite.  Still, it is a great joy to run around killing people with Toilets."
4524,Still an amazing multiplayer FPS to this very day. I'll play this game over CS:Source and CS:GO anyday.
4525,Some candy right here. You like candy? You God damn better like candy.
4526,"Game's dead, don't waste your money if you live in Australia. (Hint: I live in Australia, and there are no active australian players, and if you're aussie and you read this and write ""I'm active"" yeah that's 1, and 1 v 1's are so boring in this game and repetitive) 

 It had potential but nobody plays it. The people who do play it are really good and if you're semi decent at shooters this game is easy to do well in. Grenade + Grav Gun combo = OP. 
Pings above 100 for this game makes it unplayable. I played on 238 ping and had a hard time hitting shots. Resulting in taking 2 whole magazines to kill one guy.

4553,So many ways to kill people. Never fails to impress.
4554,Literally NO servers.
4555,"It is a truly awesome game!

AWESOME maps, (custom and official)

4561,"pew pew, flying toilets and stuff."
4562,"Its like Half-Life but without an engaging campaign. Instead, you kill your friends with toilets. Which in my opinion is the coolest shit."
4563,Still the most fun you can have without having to crowbar a jakey
4564,"The only reason to ever play this is for the gravity gun. Which isn't that useful here. So yeah, not exactly the best multiplayer game."

4652,no weapons needed. Gravity is more than enough to have a lot of fun.
4653,"guilty pleasure. i don't think this is an objectively good game, compared to say quake 3 arena or any other deathmatch game, but this game just holds a really warm place in my heart. weapons are weird and unbalanced. lots of people will nade the ground and then pick up with the gravity gun and hurl it at you, immediately decimating you in one-shot. frustrating. modded servers can be fun, i enjoy ones where every weapon is considered one-shot therefore you can pick off someone from across the map with the pistol and it feels oddly satisfying. really fun with friends too, maybe make a listen server and get some homies together on discord and have a good old time chucking helicopter blades, or as we call them ""spin to wins,"" at your friends"
4654,Hos lo recomiendo es mejor de lo que parece
4655,"Half-Life 2 Deathmatch has the distinction of being miles above what the old Half-Life 1 Deathmatch was due only to one single addition. The Gravity Gun. This little device turns what is and otherwise fairly mundane multi-player experience into many hours of high powered fun. Killing people with toilets never gets old.

It is however, Half-Life 2. So if you own Half-Life 2 Deathmatch you already have access to literally hundreds of free multi-player games, many of the using the gravity gun or similar devices and in much more interesting ways than the basic Deathmatch you got here.

So while it is by far more entertaining than what was included as a multi-player mode in the original Half-Life it is just the basic Half-Life 2 multi-player and not really worth much."

HL2DM was great for it's time and long afterward. However, the era of Source game domination has mostly ended, and especially so for the Half-Life franchise. This is of course the sole fault of Gabe Newell and his inaction to build on the momentum that once existed. Can there be a resurrection? I want to say Yes, but my faith in Valve is greatly diminished year after year."
4664,"I find myself describing everything as 'fun'

it's true, though

this game however is 10/10 would purchase fun. the ONLY ISSUE with this game is that it's sometimes hard to find a server to play on (if you're in SEA)

4687,Hi!
4688,"This is a multiplayer game that is active and kicking today with a nice community. It feels like the community just wants to have fun instead of just run, gun, and kill each other. There are alot of custom maps to choose from. I found a map were you could play on Quake III Arena maps but with the Half life weapons. There are bots to play with or human players. This game is strictly multiplayer but has a single side if you just want to kill bots. The sounds of the weapons really have that pop to them. The graphics are just like Half Life 2 which are great. The whole game is really well done and brings you back for more. I have really enjoyed this game and if you like multiplayer games then this is definitely one to pick up."

I had a shitty ATI Graphic card and i got this game. Installed it, everyone was playing better than me. I was always dying but i couldn't give up, it was fun. I learned some bunny hop in a local server and improved myself. I was getting better. Oh, and there was alot of Roleplay servers. Now theres only 1, at least there was only 1 in 2015. I started steam with this game. I had a limited user account and i couldn't add people. I met someone, he bought me Portal 2. I really owe him now and i dont know what happened to him. I played Portal 2 and finished the game. Then i started to play coop and i met someone, guess what? He bought me Garry's Mod and that was where did my life began.

Now theres only russian people. In every server. Expect the one roleplay server i was talking about.

Presentation: 7/10 (Source. old. meh. works though.)
Soundtrack: 8/10 (I don't remember any BGM, however the SE are superb and recognizable)
Replayability: 7/10 (If you have garry's mod this will replace it.)"
4771,This game is a CLASSIC. There are tons of maps that are classic as well. But be warned - the pace is SUPER FAST. Sometimes I think it's too fast. Very fun. Everything you loved in HL2 - multiplayer style. It's also free. Google steam nvidia or  amd hl2dm giveway or promo or offer or whatever it is.
4772,"Nice casual game that appeared at the wrong time in gaming trends, if it maybe appeared in 2017 with a bit of more maps and some customization micro transactions, it would be a success, however a nice game at the time, nostalgic purposes only."

4785,No.1
4786,Throwing Toilets has never been so much fun! plus you can wack someone with a crowbar without going to jail.... i made the mistake of doing that in real life! not gonna happen again! (probably will happen again)
4787,"This game used to be offered for free to users of NVIDIA and ATI graphics cards in promotional bundles. I think this was the first real game on my Steam account, thanks to the GeForce in one of my old laptops. The promotions aren't going anymore, unfortunately.

The game itself is pretty much what it says, although there are a number of roleplaying and puzzle map servers. Released shortly after [url=http://steamcommunity.com/id/trar/recommended/220/]Half-Life 2[/url] itself, it retains the sprinting system and all of the weapons, including the Gravity Gun, which makes this particular deathmatch game rather unique as well as fast-paced. My understanding of the community is that it's not very big and mostly comprised of older players like with Quake, since this game is more than 10 years old. I haven't played this in a while, to be honest, but it was pretty good for me back in the day for what that's worth.

There are two new weapons introduced in this game: the Combine nightstick and the SLAM mine. The former is slower but more powerful than the crowbar, the latter can be used as a tripmine or a remote explosive. The default maps are quite good, but there's quite an arrangement of custom maps as well.

I'd recommend it, but on sale. If the community were larger, I'd recommend it at full price. Fortunately, Valve games go on sale regularly with the annual major sale cycle, and if you can get a couple of friends to buy it as well you're probably in for a good time. You don't need to own HL2, but if you buy or have bought HL2 you [i]might[/i] already have this."

No one is better than the players here and no one made me happier than hl2:dm gamers!!!"

4802,fuck this game
4803,"Valve had the gall to charge $5 for something that should've been included with HL2. With that said, HL2:DM offers exactly what you'd expect, HL2 with multiplayer options. There are no new weapons or character skins, only new maps and the only gametype is, guess what, deathmatch. This REALLY feels EXACTLY like HL2, and as you can guess, the transition from single player to multiplayer leaves a massive chasm in the world of weapon balance."

4858,You kill people with bricks. Just my ex-wife.
4859,"It's fun, however it misses something from Half Life 2, without really knowing what it is.

I like it.

Overall: 7.5/10."
4860,"This installment isn't as classic as its predecessor, but it has toilets and watermelons.  Ever get hit in the face with a toilet projected towards you with a gravity gun?  No?  Uninstall Steam now, you disgrace."

4877,"It's free and is fun when you have friends to play with. Some servers also offer special mods, even to an extent of a pseudo-GMOD. However, the fun is short-lived; it doesn't last long because it either becomes a camper-fest or it becomes as ""the player who gets the rocket launcher or crossbow first."
4878,this game is awesome

4892,"This is a neutral ground for multiplayer on the Source Engine. Fighting people with physics objects is always entertaining even if there are still those assholes who insist on shooting you with guns instead. I only recommend this to Half-Life fans, or people interested in developing for the Source Engine."

4903,This is a very fune game!
4904,You can throw toilets at people. See? Its right there on the splash image!

4911,I ran a server for two years for this one.  I never regretted a moment spent playing this game.  It's exceptional and so are the friends you make playing it.
4912,"They just gave me this and I don't really know why. I wouldn't call it a ""game"""
4913,One of the best multiplayer experiences i've had as a PC gamer. Very original and creative... two thumbs up!
4914,Really chaotic.
4915,(y)
4916,Well it's... Half-Life 2 Multiplayer. What else do I need to say? Nothing more satisfying than using a gravity gun to blast stuff at people! Love it!
4917,"Игра так себе, но играть можно если будет скучно"
4918,"The game involves shooting other players and also using the fancy gravity gun to throw toilets and other bathroom paraphernalia around. I do sometimes worry that people might take it all to heart and start thoroughly wrecking their hosts' conveniences under the guise of being polite. Having visited some of the rougher areas of south west England, it sadly seems that public toilets are also under threat from this kind of behaviour. In conclusion, I do recommend it, but, for the sake of her majesty, please don't let it go to your head."
4919,The first steam game i ever played :)
4920,"Best, Game, EVER"
4921,"Love it! Great community, Lots of game modes, many different servers each with its own awesome plugins and community."
4922,dios pero que buen juego
4923,"Yea, well this game is cool sometimes I guess. I usually just come on here to play the Jump Guy maps. Jump Guy is pretty fun I guess."
4924,why not? its fun =P
4925,gra ma ladna grafike (jak na 2004r.) fajnie sie w nia gra oraz sa fajne typy serverow o ktorych tu nie napisze bo trzeba sie samemu dowiedziec  ;)
4926,dont try this at home!
4927,This game is free if you have a Ati or Nvidia graphics card. Google it.
4928,"its HL2, but deathmatch"
4929,Killed by a flying toilet
4930,funny game
4931,i killed a person with a kitchen sink
4932,I think Half-Life 2: Deathmatch is a pretty cool guy. eh kills friends and doesn't afraid of gravity gun.

4937,probably gay
4938,"I haven't played that much of Arena Shooters, but playing it on Source Engine it's kinda great.

You need to ask people around on some forums for 1vs1, because public servers with more than 10 players is kinda mess, obviously If you don't mind dying every second to random explosion I guess it's your shtick. 

You can still find active comp. community and Youtube channel that uploads almost daily a lot of videos/demos from duels."

4947,The gravity gun is freakin' awesome for throwing urinals at people. GET THIS GAMEEEEEE
4948,"Whether you like the Half-Life story or not this game would pick you up instantly. This game has the fast-paced gameplay that surpassess Team Fortress 2 and is up there with Counter Strike: Source. This title offers all of the weapons, locales, and characters that Half-Life 2 had. While you may begin to think it is only just killing with Half-Life weapons, you're wrong. The Source engine's hyper-realistic physics adds one of the most immense and chaotic settings to a multiplayer game I have ever experienced. The gravity gun is equipped to all players and there are tons of physics objects that can be used as weapons. With the Source engine and its endless possiblities, this game is a must-try, especially for non-Half Life fans. The price is inarguable how much this should have more players on the servers. Try Half-Life 2: Deathmatch today!"
4949,"For a mod which is actually free, it's a nice game, if you play it with friends.

4953,"Will never replace the original, but it's still a good FFA frag fest."
4954,"HL2: Deathmatch is different from other shooters because you are forced to constantly change weapons. If you can't switch between gravity-guning an explosive barrel to head-shotting with a revolver in the span of a few seconds, you're going to get your ass kicked. HL2 Deathmatch is crazy, fast-paced arena shooting fun- ESPECIALLY on low gravity servers."

4963,just like half life 2 but with other things like mods or somthing

4966,"Awesome Game, if you play this Game, go and search a Server named Manni's funnyhouse and have fun on the js,Coop  maps and sounds xD"
4967,"The main strategy of this fast-paced FPS game is to pick up an object such as a barrel and shoot it at your opponent using your Zero Point Energy Gun 'Gravity Gun'
Or by standing inside of a container, waiting for someone to spawn so that you can happily shoot them from behind. Also, Steam is hosting an offer for those wth NVIDIA. If you have it, you can get the demo of portal Half-Life 2 Deathmatch, and Half-Life 2 Lost Coast for free."

4976,Great multiplayer fps but if you have a nvidia or ati graphics card you can get this for free.
4977,"Haha, stick to single-player and Source mods (like counter-strike). This was a neat bonus of buying Half-Life 2 in 2004, but within like a month, no one was playing it. It is enjoyable, but there are much better purchases for $5."

Nothing can i say about Half Life 2: Deathmatch is misdimineaning nor False. My words alone cannot express how fun this game was and is today. Players still play this intense game everyday like Half Life Deathmatch. yet Counter STrike still holds the king of fps on their teeth. :P

Kings of FPS, whether old and imperfect show a real balance in teh ways of gaming today.  We owe our fps's games and everything mostly to this game (MAYBE!) . 

Let it be known if you harm this game i will get my gravity gun and shoot you to Oblviion!!!

5012,A fun multyplayer game that offers servers for anyone from sniping to team deathmatch to even coop servers.  A game where if your in the right server and a really good map with great people can results in hours upon hours of gameplay. I will definately recommend this game to anyone
5013,"Crouching Freeman, flying toilet."
5014,"Basically it's Half Life 2 but in deathmatch. Might sound pretty awesome on paper but it really isn't. Physics based deathmatch is pretty fun, but the problem is that props can easily spell the end for you and kill you in one blast, pretty cheap to be honest, and the whole gameplay of shooting props at one another gets old pretty quickly. The community is pretty much mostly gone, leaving behind little kids who got this game for free. Why can't this game be more like Half Life 2 survivor's battle mode? Well, I guess western PC gamers don't like interesting things, or because Valve really doesn't give a shit about Half Life anymore after 2007. CSS and TF2 gets years of countless updates, but HL2 Deathmatch is mostly just stuck in the past.

Most of the cool stuff has been put in gmod a long time ago anyways."

5019,"Although I prefer playing some of the newer/modern games, Half Life 2 Deathmatch is a classic with INFINITE replay value. Just look at all the custom/roleplay/modded servers and you'll see why."

5028,"What else? You got your favorite game Half-Life 2 there, and multiplayer! Actually, the game is nothing more than joining any server and start playing. But don't play it slow like HL2 - run FAST, jump FAST, pick up and throw stuff with the gravity gun FAST. Like Counter-Strike Source, skill is mostly required but won't get in the way of throwing something into someones face for a kill. Primarily an explosive barrel into a pile of idiots."

5041,Great game lots of fun.
5042,"Its like a bubble-butt. A little bit bloated, but great fun. And squidgy."
5043,"This is a sweet, fast moving FPS, worthy as a counterpart to Hl2, I highly suggest you get it."
5044,"I'd like to think that everything that happens in this game is part of the official Half-Life canon. 

This means that while Gordon Freeman and the Resistance are out trying to free our species from the death-grip of the Combine, someone, somewhere is shooting a toilet at a transhumanist with a gun. They will repeat this process ad nauseum over and over until they decide to lock themselves in a stone building, trying their best to solve puzzles for no readily available reason."
5045,"At one point this was a fantastic deathmatch game, unforunately now it is only populated by scrubs that think bunnyhopping is an ""exploit"" and shitty role playing (yes people actually roleplay in a fucking FPS game) and weird co-op servers. There are a couple legit servers left but they are rarely populated. :( The rest of the servers are shitty low grav maps that are just giant boxes."
5046,Nice game bro's !
5047,Havent played this one in awhile but still it seems cool.
5048,"This game used to be free, but its gone to £2.99 now. Still an excllent price and there is so much in the game to do.

I go on it with 4 of my friends usually, and come off the game in a better mood than in-which i came on.

Defonatly worth the buy, even though it used to be free."
5049,Get it! Its free!

5052,Классный Шутер!
5053,"Deathmatch is far out, it gives you sore arms and hands
Vortegaunts sometime are funny they fold their hands in front of their bellies that means they wont attack you and you can walk right by them, one even put  on a dance show for me once lol I hate to kill them, in half-life 2 they were your friends and here they get slaughterd. Plenty of action and fun friends to play with.
Next time you play, observe the Vortegaunts it makes for so much more fun if they let you walk by!!!!!!"
5054,Just get it

The servers are fantastic giving varieties of different game mode servers such as co-op zombie killing servers, deathmatch servers, TDM servers, build puzzle servers, roleplay servers and many more. If you're looking for a game that has these modes, then HL2 Deathmatch is just for you!"

Valve, thanks for never breaking the game and all the continued support. x2"

5077,Great game
5078,"Quite a lot of fun, especially using the gravity gun to launch toilets at people. I'm not sure it ever gets old, and it's fast paced."
5079,"Throw-a-toilet simulator, very good physics. Get it you like throwing toilets IRL."
5080,"Half-Life 2: Deathmatch brings back the adrenaline pumped feeling from old Deathmatch classics such as Unreal tournament and Quake.

5082,"Not worth a penny, thankfully there is a promo that lets you get this for free."
5083,"You wanna know whats make this multiplayer uniqe and much more fun than unreal, quake or other old school fastpaced games?

Gravity gun !

This element makes game much more unperdictible and fun. If you have skills and some balls you will like it too =D"
5084,"I've never played any other multi-player game that's as fast-paced and fun to play as Half-Life 2: Deathmatch. I love how the human element adds unpredictability to the gameplay... it's never the same game twice. Basically, It's the thrill of hunting you down and killing you.
Beware:
* I've been playing this game for over 9 years.
* I can locate you by sound alone.
* If possible, I will attack you from behind.

Kill you later..."

5089,This is entertaining for awhile. Until you get spawn camped by two guys punting cars back and forth over the spawn points. That's about when it stops being entertaining.
5090,good game
5091,"decent system requirments, large community, cheap, all around fun"
5092,"Play Gravity Gun Deathmatch or thousands of godawful custom maps.
The Gravity Gun Deathmatch part is kinda fun unless you play it for more than 10 minutes straight, problem is people only play the godawful custom maps for some stupid reason."
5093,"Half  Life 2 Deathmatch is an awsome game with awsome pepole such as [MGO] dan, grammer nazi and many many more and as well as killing other pepole you can go on RPing and co-op puzzle\killing severs so weather you like to be in a team, camp (no camping) or have every one againest everyone hl2:dm is the one place you can get a toilet to the face (at about 100 - 200 mph)"

5099,"It is a game were if you like Counter Strike, but you dislike the one life part. It a  Deathmatch game, except with a gravity gun.  
Also it is free, so if you're out of cash and you want a good game, this would be a good pick.
Do you have times were you friends that play x-box and don't believe PC Games are good. Then make them try this game they have nothing to lose, but much to gain.

PC GAMERS RULE

5101,"It's free if you have a Radeon or Nividia video card, and you basically fight people with HL2 wepons.

Yes.

No.

And free gets pretty damn good."

5110,"I loved this game. I played the life out of it way back when around 2005-2007. Prior to the days of Garry's Mod (or at least when it was less popular), I used to play on a build server called Mikes revenge, where you were able to spawn props and items, where you were able to make your own little home and bases etc. Until the server crashed and restarted...

I also played on a lot of roleplay, surf, co-op maps, a few fishing maps (where you put a watermelon into a water, wait for a random prop or NPC to spawn after taking it out), and a ton of other really cool interesting rare maps which are no longer downloadable anywhere. I'll probably upload them all soon somewhere.

I hope this game becomes free to play at some point, because it was temporarily during early 2008 under the 'Portal: The First Slice' offer for Nvidia and ATI users. However, there are around 60 servers now as opposed to 1000+"
5111,HL² mutli-awesomeness
5112,So godamn silly and chaotic.
