26,"Not fun in SP. Only if you're playing Multiplayer. Spent a day and a half to build a raft only to find out it doesn't work with 1 person. I shouldn't be allowed to be crafted in SP in that case. 

Spawn rate of enemies is insane for SP. I had to kill 3 scouting parties on my first day... that I survived. I had to read on the web that you're not supposed to stay near the plane. I died twice to that mistake. 

I'm not sure how to make food. I put meat on a drying rack, but the cannibals walk up and eat it off the rack. I never saw a way to cook on a fire, but also fire causes cannibals to spawn; so you're best not ever making a fire. You cannot sleep. You'll just be sitting in pitch black, waiting to die, as once the sun goes down your shelter only allows you to save. 

It might be fun in MP, like I said, but I don't have friends; so this isn't my game"

28,Great game to play with friends
29,"Pretty decent survival game. A little bit short for my taste but all in all, very fun experience when played with friends. The building in this game takes some skill and is a little bit challenging. However, all in all, a great game for survival game enthusiasts."

42,"Probably a good game, seeing as I'm a huge Long Dark fan. 
Unplayable due to the lack of mouse binding options, which is ALWAYS a deal breaker.
Any developer producing games without giving the player freedom of binding needs to be kicked in the shin.
Hard.
Do the basics first, allow the players to play the game.
Negative...always negative, always will be."

49,THESEA
50,nice
51,"Highly recommend this one guys, especially if you love horror and the feeling of constant dread looming over you. Mundane tasks like gathering food and wood for building becomes a stress induced nightmare that's surprisingly satisfying. The overall game loop is really fluid and great once you understand what combines into what to make special items that are crucial to making it past the first week or so. Building and utilizing all the different traps you can make and test on the cannibals is so fun to watch especially after the stress they cause you. Highly recommend this one guys."
52,"it's a good game fun to play with the friends
this is my review please give me awards"

Just searching for food and materials, fighting lots of cannibals, and eventually taking control of said cannibals. you can chop down trees and build a base to keep you protected as well. all in all a good game."

101,"Great game for any survival horror enthusiasts. If you are playing just for the story line it is short, I would say it took about 4 hours to beat the story with a group of friends. But of course if you play for the full experience of surviving day by day and slowly completing the story then it can take much more hours. The building in the game is easy to do but can take some time to build since you will have to collect each resource. Crafting can be confusing since there is no blueprint but there isn't like a crazy amount of items to craft, so you can pick it up fast.

102,"I really wanted to give this game a chance because of the huge amount of positive reviews it has, but I really don't see what people see in it.

There are significant bugs everywhere and the gameplay is very shallow, for example all combat in the game (*ALL*) is circle strafe to win or simply hold block w/ any max block weapon. This is true even on the hardest difficulty setting. Cheese combat is mainly driven by the fact that literally everything in the game is faster, tougher, and does more damage than the player. They have to be because their pathing is pretty horrible and easily exploited by the player. If you can stand on a rock or cliff, you can pretty much guarantee a win against anything, as it will either fling itself off the cliff while running around at full speed, or stop dead and wait for you to attack it assuming the rock is tall enough.

Key items are hidden in extremely dark caves with zero information in game on how to progress (No where, how, or even why for anything), making it virtually impossible without an astronomical time sink to make forward progress because it is basically done by blind chance without a Steam or Google guide. Not even a decent ""bread crumb trail"" to slowly direct you towards where you need to go.

The huge amount of ""stumble through until you figure it out"" would be bearable if the game had meaningful progression outside of those key items your expected to find, but it doesn't, you can build a base that will carry you through the entire game within the first couple hours. Once again, even on the hardest difficulty setting. Base building itself seems very basic as well, they give you the tools to make a bigger base, but a bigger base is quite pointless as all the buildings are basically the same and there is no functional reason to make one large.

The atmosphere of the game and the environmental storytelling are pretty decent but they unfortunately do not make up for the design problems.

The game simply needs more to do for as open as it is, or a better system of guiding the player through the content that it does have."

111,"Really great game with a great story line.

Can often get caught up in the craft, construct, build element of the game - if you're not a fan of that type of game (I'm not massively), you do not need to do this here, it is an optional feature and you can run through the game without doing much of any of it if need be!

Recommend playing this with a friend for a good laugh!"

117,"I didn't like it and I don't get the hype. An awkward game in so many respects - the annoying story, the graphics, the ""creative"" interface, the mechanics... 

Even the style... it did bad things to me. Looting that n:th copy of hipster outfit no 5. I felt the urge to kill my friends in-game with the fire axe just because of their looks, wearing hipster outfit no 1, 3, 4 and 4 respectively. (Trevor Philips, where were you when I needed you the most!)

I patiently endured it until the end, out of loyalty (to my friends). But every minute, save maybe the first two hours, I kept longing for a quality survival game. There are so many. Something like Conan Exiles, Subnautica, DayZ, The Long Dark or even Minecraft.

Timmeeeeee? Here's Johnny!"

134,"This is one of those instances where a theoretical 'neutral' review rating would be preferred. This is more of a critique rather than a binary recommendation.

I appreciate games that can be hardcore...through options. It's not the way I usually like to play, but I appreciate the option for those that want that experience. If you go in blind this game can be brutal in a few ways.

Despite a whopping 340K reviews, 70% of players have played some amount of multiplayer. That's impressive. Unfortunately there is a key difference between the solo experience and multiplayer. In single-player when you 'die' the first time you get dragged to a cave. This specific cave has a map and a compass, two of the most important items in the game. This is obviously intentional and I think is a nice way of giving the player a map but first allowing them to naturally explore. In multiplayer though, you just die.

If you jump straight into multiplayer like me then good luck finding the map organically. Some people would prefer this, but my problem is that there are tons of trees and hills on this island that obscure your vision and there aren't many distinct landmarks compared to some other open-world games. It's clearly intentional to get the map in single-player, so why didn't they do it for multiplayer when you both die? At least give me an option.

The map itself isn't very detailed, which is fine, but there is a problem. When you die the map completely resets. This makes no sense and is one of those 'hardcore' design choices that I can't believe isn't an option.

If the concern is 'immersion' then why are we able to see icon indicators of our sleeping-buildings regardless of our location? Why are we able to change the lighting/color rendering to significantly brighten caves? Why are we able to hold an insane amount of items in our backpack? Why can we hold two logs in one arm while sprinting?

I'm hoping the sequel has more landmarks and gives more options for details that would otherwise default to 'hardcore'."
135,fun ig
136,"The jungle, Is an alright game. Really enjoy the hiking in the forests, the people are nice and friendly."
137,"more of a realistic survival game which shows lots of ways of fun dynamic into a survival aspect of a survival game
"
138,yep
139,Game is alright but the lowest sensitivity is far too high for anyone playing above 400 dpi.  game deserves a negative rating simply for the fact that the devs are either too lazy or incompetent to let you go to a lower sensitivity
140,why not very good game fr
141,yes
142,its good if your friends arent 12 that just wanna slide down hills on turtle shells
143,this is a great open world game i recomend it
144,"I jumped on the game with a couple of my boys and we made a nice bando during day time. But as soon as it turned night time one bald headed nonce jumped out screaming like one nitty. obviously me and the mandem had to glide out and clap him up with a rock, then we grilled him on a camp fire and used his bones as clothing. When you get to day 10 and above some weird shit starts to happen the bald nonces start turning blue and some are wam and fat. But the worst is when some hoe with 19 legs starts dashing out babies out of her loose coochie at your yard. 

Overall i recommend this game to people that have friends otherwise this aint the one."

152,"Good game with nice graphics and mechanics. Sadly, quite complex building part is rather unnecessary - game takes too short to complete and there is no need for sophisticated bases, at least in the standard difficulty mode. It would be nice if game was enforcing constructing base to survive attacks of cannibal/mutant hordes. These could be triggered by reaching some stages in the story line."

From the start there's no guide to understanding how it works, or doesn't.   Enemies are so fast and strong, two hits I'm dead, 10 hits and they keep getting up.  4-5 at a time near the starting point.  Aside from the bugs like items spawning or building walls despawning, this game needs a lot of polishing."

Can be scary at first, but once you know what your doing its a fun, great, light hearted survival game 10/10."

My friends and I were actually enjoying the tediousness of grinding this game had to offer for our first 12 hours of play time. Then it just throws legsies and armsies at you so frequently that they're not even scary anymore, just a nuisance because we know we'll have to waste all of our dynamite. I thought this game was about a plane crash survivor looking for his child on an island inhabited by cannibal mutants and frightening creatures like you've never seen. And it is exactly that until it's not, and its about random labs full of random experiments, and alien laser beam launchers that shoot down other planes with children on them. Then it's just some stupid ugly child with a terrible haircut having seizures on the Black Jimmy Fallon show then growing up to have live testes growing in his arms. And his haircut still trash. Sons of the forest better be good and actually make coherent sense narrative wise or I might have to intervene fr."

Alright so basically you crash, then you die. 
Then you wake up and watch your child get yoinked.
Then you die. 
Then you wake up and pull an axe out of some lady's chest. 
Then you go party in the forest and cut down literally every tree in sight.
Now that you are no longer in the forest, you kill some people and eat them.
Then you get a re-breather so you can look for a piece of paper.
Using that piece of paper, you build a roller coaster and ignore the fact that you child was stolen.
(What child?)
You then party again in the field with your friends and live another day!

325,"Incomplete game.
I waited for years, expecting this game to be yet another permanent early access survival that just stops being developed but is sold otherwise. Surprisingly, this one did finally reach its release, and the reviews were even positive, so I went ahead an got it.
Well...

Honestly, I feel scammed. For someone who expects games to have some minimum quality, and don't just turn a blind eye because all others in the genre are the same, this game is not playable.
Everywhere you look, there are details that have never been cared for. If a game is developed over years, and being honest, this one was just like it is now for a while, I do expect not to feel like I'm playing a game made by a highschool student as a homework assignment. Yes, the scale is way larger, but the gameplay feels pretty much as unpolished.
Let me give a few examples that I can make out from memory:
-Mobs that spawn under you, but to make it fair, they might despawn pretty much the same way (it's not very common, but not that rare either)
-Freaking alligators that simply stay still while you murder them for skin. Really? Is this the final release, when the **** alligator's AI doesn't have any way to attack? Unreal.
-Enemies that stand still as you attack them time and time again. But don't worry, their friends do just so. (I believe this one is intentional, for balancing purposes... but needing this method already shows how uncared for it has been)
-You can't even cook well, or dry meat for instance. You take the dried one, try to leave a new one, and have no way of selecting which to leave, so you leave again the dried one.
-The inventory management is complete crap. Not a bug by itself, but a clear indicator of the little maintenance it has received.

It's pretty sad, to be fair. The game looks amazing visually in many ways. The theme is well achieved, if the enemies weren't completely ret*rded, but it really is dark and decently thrilling sometimes. It's just sad that it is not enjoyable if you don't play with people to make up for the game itself."
326,"when you crash -> you lose all your progression since your last save.
when you get disconnected for no reason  -> you lose all your progression since your last save.
 ruined the entire game for me"

328,"The Forest feels like two different games combined. There's ""The Forest"" or the outdoors survival crafting part of the game that takes place above ground and then there's ""The Caves"" or the part of the game that takes place underground.

The above ground half is my least favorite. You get a lot of cool options for things to build but the more complicated something is, the less likely it is you'll be able to finish and enjoy it before a swarm of cannibals shows up and ruins your day. You are meant to believe the cannibals are constantly patrolling the island and there's some sort of logic that leads to them finding you but I swear they just spawn behind me when I'm chopping trees sometimes. It doesn't help that the sound design is lacking; you are completely deaf to things happening behind you. Also, the cannibals sound weird? Like they're low bitrate or muffled somehow? Is that just me? I found trying to establish a base of operations to be a futile exercise in single player. I ended up setting up a bunch of small huts with meat drying racks all over the island and wouldn't spend too much time at any single location. It seems like the longer you spend in an area, the more likely it is for a patrol to just spawn on you so moving around a lot is the best bet. This also means you're never going to bother with the cooler buildings like all the walls and the... gazebo? 

In fact, the building isn't the only mechanic I got through most of the game without engaging with. Once I knew I was near the end, I started googling lots of questions I had about various things. Turns out, you can make stews using the metals pots you find that give you 10 minute buffs to your stats. Also, there are stats!? Like strength and athleticism??? The game never tells you these things. You don't even find recipes for the different stews which makes it feel like an afterthought. The game will tell you that being covered in blood is an infection risk but it never explains what ""infection"" does. I'll save you the trouble; infection prevents your strength stat from leveling up. It's very likely I went through like 90% of the game without being able to level my strength stat. That sounds pretty bad but the projectile weapons don't scale with strength so it's manageable.

At this point, you probably think it's weird I gave this game a thumbs up. Well, the underground half of this game is EFFIN' RAD. It's like a dungeon crawler based on the movie ""The Descent"" and probably the best game about spelunking made. At some point, I came to see the above ground as the place where I prep for my underground dungeon crawls. Not sure why they even named this game ""The Forest"" in the first place. The caves are where it's at! The look of the caves, the sounds of the caves, the more scripted encounters that don't randomly spawn cannibals behind you, the light metroidvania elements where you find items that redefine weird features of the environment you saw a few tunnels ago; That's why the caves feels like a different (and better) game than the above ground experience. Furthermore, the cannibals in the cave stay in their rooms until you aggro them but will never leave the caves; the cannibals above ground will chase you all over the island but never go into the tunnels. This makes no sense to me and adds to the feeling that there are two different games here. It's an oversight that also means setting up camps just inside the entrance of a cave is the safest plan. Cannibals will never find you there unless you go further in and kite the cave cannibals back to your camp.

Overall, I had a great time. Maybe if you play with friends, you can just brute force your way through the cannibals on the surface and build some cool shit but it seems like the meta strat is to never build anything substantial and just live in the caves as much as possible. To me, that makes this a weak survival crafting game, but it's still a very cool spelunking horror game! Look at it this way, there's lots of room to improve for the sequel!"
329,It is fun
330,Excellent game
331,Well
332,"I am a 51 yo father, probably one of the oldest people playing this game. I am a single farther to my Son, who is 14 now. My son got this game for Christmas in 2021 from his uncle, so we installed it on his computer and he started playing. By the end of the week he had 24 hours on this game. This was horrible for me, as it was already hard for me to find ways to spend time with my son, as he is always out with his friends or just watching YouTube. So I decided to make a Steam account and get this game to see if I could maybe play alongside him. I loaded into the game, picked my character and started playing but I was stuck on what you where supposed to do. I asked my Son for help and he hosted a game for me to join. I loved it as it was the best time I had spent with my Son since my wife had died. This game has ever since brought me and my son closer again and now we actually spend time together outside the house together as well. This game reminded me that there's fun to be had in everything, and it has brought both me and my Son many happy memories."

395,"An average survival game. Graphics are just tight fixed for a sandbox world, but sometimes shows glitches even with low quality, but demanding powerfull hardware anyway. The mouse buttons cannot be binded, so without a gamepad or jostick, many important actions must be asigned to keyboard. 

Mechanics of crafting are good, easy to learn and with many items and builds to made, working fine as good wood & stone survival building simulator. But this product have remarkable issues. The worst is the fact that player cant choose what kind and how many things he want to carry with him, ruining all sense of realism: he can carry lot of big and heavy garbage as skulls, enemie's body parts (?), rocks, bad weapons... but limites basic things as water or ammo. There are more important issues that downgrade the product, as system of water potabilization and map marking stop working, or the excessive speed of cycles for hunger, thirst, day, night.

Enemies are very well depicted, can provoque fear and even can be smart in their madness, are best of the game, but some of them causes excessive damage with bare hands and close combat system ever feels really clumsy. There are two kinds of enviroments: surface and undergrounds. The first are pretty nice open and enlighted fields, coastal and forestal places, but many zones are empty of something of interest except virgin nature; exploring for searching oddities is not specially rewarding far away from small camps. The second are caves, claustrofobical, dark and twisted, with many levels of deep, gore, dangerous places for fighting, and the most of useful things and  best rewards. 

To complete all objectives, build a strong camp and explore all map in normal level, takes about 70 hours. Is a product very extreme, with great pros and contras, its more famous and expensive than deserves compared with other titles, maybe because it has enjoyed one of the finest hype job from fans ever seen, surely by multiplayer, as proof that even a rudely designed and bugged game can be good with friends. But a single player will see it as really is, naked in its glorious mediocrity."

Cave exploring is pretty fun but i don't suggest doing it by yourself unless u got sum balls.

417,"Can be as long or as short as you like it to be. The AI is pretty solid with unpredictable enemies, the building UI is superb (no need to constantly check your inventory and journal to know how many more logs you need, it's displayed on your screen), and playing with headphones adds to the creep factor because not only are you playing The Forest, but you're also playing ""Is That A Falling Leaf Or Is It A Cannibal"".
As for fun factor, I personally am having a blast. Sometimes huge monsters show up and wreck my whole scene, and sometimes four naked weirdos follow me around while I gather resources."

It's a survival crafting game with a set map that doesn't change, promotes hoarding with its inventory system, has weapons that don't feel like Oblivion, the enemies that don't attack you in the very beginning phases so you can explore, until you make the conscious choice to anger them, and to top it all off, it controls like Gmod. Pure sprinting around at Mach 3, jumping like you're on the moon with no stamina drawback, backpedaling after every attack, and swing timing action.

For those that play by themselves: play through the story. It's worth it.
Seriously.

On your first playthrough...

Do: 
-Utilize the To-Do List
-Explore the caves for loot.
-Block cannibal attacks.
-Kill the skinny dirty ones if they won't leave you alone.
-Kill every mutant you see.
-Burn bodies for bones.
-Make temporary shelters to save your game (often) then destroy the shelter and move on.

Don't:
-Settle in one place
-Build a big base
-Cut down trees
-Chase the cannibals
-Sleep"
433,"The forest is an Indie masterpiece infected with bugs that are a bit frustrating and can subtract from the overall magnificent game. 

You are tasked with a seemingly impossible mission, save your son from an island that is set to kill and rip you apart. Crafting is fun, base building allows and expects you to be creative in order to solve the constant attacks, the survival mechanics enhance the game without being tedious or overly taxing. The AI of the enemies is most of the time amazing, they will coordinate, they will patrol around your base and leave markers for others to come attack, they will plan sieges with mutants and will prioritize your food racks and walls. The caves feel oppressive but fair, the water exploration is mostly safe while making you feel like you could drown at any minute, the forest is plentiful with opportunities to eat but only for those that learn where to look.

My only negatives are: Bugs, bugs and more bugs.
Skinning deer or driving sleds sometimes sends you flying and kills you, mutants that push you, can and most definitely will make you fall through the world. In multiplayer only the host is allowed to raise more than 2 points of stats per play through, the other players will not be able to raise their strength more than 2 points. If they want to, they will need to leave and reconnect. If both go on a boat house the fire can glitch and become invisible, the boat house will seemingly disappear for no reason to then comeback. Items will disappear and become unavailable and render impossible the crafting of that item (happened with the gun). If you build a lot the game will tank while near or in your base.

If you can look pass the bugs this is an amazing, must-play title for everybody who likes survival games with building and crafting.

454,"The Forest is a great game for all levels of player. I have played hours with my much more game savvy boyfriend and never felt like I was holding him back. The game is intuitive enough that a complete newbie can jump in and have fun, but challenging enough that anyone who plays will keep coming back for more. The game has so many different playing styles.

The game is a little gory and can be a little intense. I have enjoyed it hugely & will continue to pour hours into my new favorite game!"
455,"yes
"
456,"there were cannibals, now there are not"
457,"I killed an ate a man. To survive. I mean yeah, I had berries sure. And yeah some turtle meat and deer and all that.  But that's not gonna last forever. I had to do it, judge. So I mean yeah, am I ""guilty""? Well I did it, but I'm not guilty. You would have done the same in my situation. 

Now I don't know what I did exactly. I originally just planned on retiring to the seashore, next thing I know I'm elbow deep in the torso of this man I just met trying to get all of his organs out. I never field dressed a person. You? It's pretty difficult. Anyway yeah, I killed him. And yes I used a club made out of the skull of another man, but I promise that's just totally coincidental. I FOUND that skull, you see. At first I thought it was a halloween decoration, but no. Real skull. Can you believe it? 

Anyway he kept hooting and hollering at me from a distance for god knows what reason. I've never been catcalled before, much less followed and catcalled. I know I have a rather feminine build compared to most men who are starving but this is just kind of ridiculous. I was offended, mortified, and scared all at the same time. What am I, a piece of meat? An object? Do I not have dreams, hopes, and ambitions? Overcome with empathy for the struggles of women across the world on account of my own exposure to toxic masculinity that I thought I'd give this wolf whistling boar a piece of my mind. 

""Hey you!"" I sez, ""Did you not stop for a single minute to see how I would feel? How your behavior impacts others around you? How it perpetuates feelings of insecurity and shame throughout our society? I have a right to exist without wondering what kind of abuse I will suffer at the hands of sexist and dehumanizing men?"". And frankly your honor, screw them double. My build is not THAT feminine. I was on the wrestling team. Okay I wasn't exactly on the wrestling team, it was the ultimate frisbee team. But I was on a team, is what I mean. I had comradery with those fellows only rivaled by soldiers in the thick of battle. 

I had to WORK for that trophy. Well, it wasn't a trophy. More like a gift card. To whole foods. 

I digress. Your honor after giving this rude man a talking to he gave me a whole speech about Alphas and Betas and then said something about an ethno-state and lobsters. I don't know, it was all very odd. And he kept talking ""them"" but he never said who ""they"" are. Clearly this man was out of his mind. And racist. And I can't get behind that at all. He worked himself up into a misogynistic tizzy trying to explain that women only go for black men because the white man has become weak and feeble. He again gestured to my round hips and said ""SOY!"". I was afraid for my life at this point, he kept getting angrier and was frothing at the mouth. He had to be stopped before he endangered my life, your honor. He said I was a shill. A shill! Can you believe it? Me who worked at a business hired by the Biden campaign to spread awareness of pressing issues on social media. It was a well paying job and I was glad to do it. Not that that has anything to do with anything. 

He made an aggressive motion towards me and, again, fearing for my life, I bopped him upside the head with my skull on a stick thing. Then I ate him. I was always taught not to let things go to waste, and modern burials are actually very bad for the environment. 

What was that? I'm on trial for abusing steams review feature? 

Well yeah I did that, too. The game's okay."
458,"i like it, i just wish there were more monster types."
459,love this game! it's really fun to play with a large group or just two people.

462,"The Forest

Well, everything begins with you crash landing on a hostile island, your given limited supplies to start and must quickly get to work on the tutorial basics with the handy Axe you get once leaving the wreckage.

You will find there is very little to no hand holding at all, story progresses as you find details and explore, I got swepted away in building the best base possible, nice and close to the water for protection, finally got a zip line in my forest for maximum wood production, food was solid and the gardens were growing, I made better weapons and actually went on the offensive with the cannibals you encounter, yes.. this is a survival horror game, just wait till you go spelunking down the cavern depths, bring a friend as you will sh*t yourself otherwise.

Unfortunately my buddies and I never finished the story, I think we got pretty far and discovered a bunch of stuff, we will hopefully finish the game before Son of the forest comes out.

Game trailers looks incredible for sure, look forward to playing sons of the forest soon.

Taking everything from sound, atmosphere, resourse management, crafting / building and lastly combat..

This game gets a honest 9/10 I loved every moment though brief, hope to find more time with it."

But the SR for this game looks like it can handle even a low end laptops and pc but for some reason it can't even run on very decent laptop . Maybe it is the problem only for me. For this reason I refunded it. But if you don't care about the graphics and low fps, the game is pretty fun"

536,"A ray of light shines down on a leather-bound storybook. The book opens and a voice begins reading its text:

SHREK: Once upon a time there was a lovely princess. But she had an enchantment upon her of a fearful sort which could only be broken by love's first kiss. She was locked away in a castle guarded by a terrible fire-breathing dragon. Many brave knights had attempted to free her from this dreadful prison, but none prevailed. She waited in the dragon's keep in the highest room of the tallest tower. For her true love and true love's first kiss.

The voice laughs. A big, green hand rips out a page of the book and shuts it closed.

SHREK: Like that's ever gonna happen. What a load of -

We see an outhouse and hear the sound of a toilet flushing. Out steps SHREK, an ogre, who tugs at his underwear and shakes his foot of the page still stuck to his shoe. He looks lovingly at the swamp he calls home, and goes about his daily routine. This includes taking a mud shower, brushing his teeth with bugs, bathing in a muddy pond, gathering giant slugs for dinner, and painting a warning sign.

In a nearby village, an angry mob gather up to go after Shrek. At night they gather their torches and pitchforks and enter the swamp, trampling over Shrek's warning signs. Shrek sees them after investigating the commotion, rolling his eyes. The villagers stop outside Shrek's home, unaware that Shrek is sneaking up behind them.

NIGHT - NEAR SHREK'S HOME

Villager 1: Think it's in there?

Villager 2: All right. Let's get it!

Villager 1: Whoa. Hold on. Do you know what that thing can do to you?

Villager 3: Yeah, it'll grind your bones for its bread.

Shrek chuckles, revealing himself to be standing behind the mob.

SHREK: Yes, well, actually, that would be a giant.

The mob gasp.

SHREK: Now, ogres, oh they're much worse. They'll make a suit from your freshly peeled skin...

Shrek slowly approaches as the villagers back away in fear.

Villagers: No!

SHREK: They'll shave your liver. Squeeze the jelly from your eyes! Actually, it's quite good on toast.

Villager 1: Back! Back, beast! Back! I warn ya!

The villager waves his torch in Shrek's face. Shrek casually licks his fingers and pinches the flame, extinguishing the torch. The villager drops it.

Villager 1: Right...

Shrek terrifies the mob with a great frightening roar, his spit extinguishing all the remaining torches. He wipes his mouth and waits for the villagers to stop screaming.

SHREK: (Whispering) This is the part where you run away.

Shrek laughs as the men drop their torches and pitchforks and run away as fast they can.

SHREK: And stay out! (

He looks down and picks up a wanted poster dropped by one of the villagers. He reads it aloud.

SHREK: ""Wanted. Fairytale creatures""?

He sighs and walks off. dropping the poster to the ground.

THE NEXT DAY - FOREST

Fairy tale creatures are put in chains and led into wagons by Duloc Guards. The Captain of the Duloc Guards sits at a table paying a line of people their rewards for turning in the fairytale creatures. Those waiting in line include Peter Pan, who is carrying Tinkerbell in a cage, Geppetto who is carrying Pinocchio, and a farmer carrying the Three Little Pigs.

GUARD: All right. This one's full. Take it away! Move it along. Come on! Get up!

THE CAPTAIN: Next!

GUARD: (Taking the witch's broom) Give me that! Your flying days are over. (breaks the broom in half)

THE CAPTAIN: That's 20 pieces of silver for the witch. Next!

The captain hands over the reward to the villager who turned the witch in. The villager mutters to himself.

Villager: Lousy twenty pieces...

GUARD: Get up! Come on!

Waiting in line is Donkey on a leash and his owner. He looks in horror at the witch and a group of dwarves being loaded into a wagon.

GUARD: Sit down there! Be quiet!

Mama Bear and Papa Bear are locked inside giant cages, with Little Bear in his own cage.

LITTLE BEAR: (crying) This cage is too small.

DONKEY: (To his owner) Please, don't turn me in. I'll never be stubborn again. I can change. Please! Give me another chance!

OLD WOMAN: Oh, shut up. (Smacks Donkey)

DONKEY: Oh!

THE CAPTAIN: Next! What have you got?

GEPPETTO: This little wooden puppet.

PINOCCHIO: I'm not a puppet. I'm a real boy. (his nose grows)

THE CAPTAIN: Five shillings for the possessed toy. Take it away.

PINOCCHIO: Father, please! Don't let them do this! Help me!

Geppetto takes the money and walks off. The old woman steps up to the table.

THE CAPTAIN: Next! What have you got?

OLD WOMAN: Well, I've got a talking donkey.

THE CAPTAIN: Right. Well, that's good for ten shillings, if you can prove it.

OLD WOMAN: Oh, go ahead, little fella. (Donkey stays silent).

THE CAPTAIN: Well?..

OLD WOMAN: Oh, oh, he's just...he's just a little nervous. He's really quite a chatterbox. (Smacks Donkey again) Talk, you boneheaded dolt, talk!

THE CAPTAIN: That's it. I've heard enough. Guards!

OLD WOMAN: No, no, he talks! He does. (Moving Donkey's lips) I can talk. I love to talk. I'm the talking-est damn thing you ever saw.

THE CAPTAIN: Get her out of my sight.

OLD WOMAN: No, no! I swear! Oh! He can talk!

The guards grab the old woman and she struggles with them. One of her legs flies out and kicks Tinkerbell out of Peter Pan's hands, and her cage drops on Donkey's head. He gets sprinkled with fairy dust and starts floating upwards.

DONKEY: Hey! I can fly!

PETER PAN: He can fly!

THREE LITTLE PIGS: He can fly!

THE CAPTAIN: He can talk?!

DONKEY: Ha, ha! That's right, fool! Now I'm a flying, talking donkey. You might have seen a housefly, maybe even a superfly but I bet you ain't never seen a donkey fly. Ha, ha! (The pixie dust's effects begin to wear off) Uh-oh. (He drops out of the air and hits the ground with a thud.)

THE CAPTAIN: Seize him!

Donkey dodges the guards as they try to grab him and runs deeper into the forest.

GUARDS: He's getting away! Get him! This way! Turn!

Donkey escapes deeper into the forest and runs head first into Shrek's backside. Shrek turns around to see who bumped into him and glares down at Donkey. Donkey looks scared of Shrek for a moment, but he quickly hides behind him after seeing that the guards have caught up to him.

THE CAPTAIN: You there. Ogre!

SHREK: Aye?

THE CAPTAIN: By the order of Lord Farquaad, I am authorized to place you both under arrest and...(Shrek slowly approaches the group of guards, the guards visibly frightened by him) transport you to... a designated...resettlement...facility?

SHREK: Oh, really? You and what army? (Smiles)

The Captain looks behind himself and sees that all the other guards have abandoned him. The Captain tucks tail and runs off. Shrek shakes his head and starts walking back to his swamp. Donkey, impressed by Shrek, follows him.

DONKEY: Can I say something to you? Listen, you was really, really, really somethin' back here. Incredible!

SHREK: Are you talkin' to...(he turns around and Donkey is gone) me? (he turns back around and Donkey is right in front of him.) Whoa!

DONKEY: Yes. I was talkin' to you. Can I tell you that you that you was great back there? Man those guards! They thought they was all of that. Then you showed up and bam! They was trippin' over themselves like babes in the woods. That really made me feel good to see that.

SHREK: (Annoyed) Oh, that's great. Really.

DONKEY: Man, it's good to be free.

SHREK: Now, why don't you go celebrate your freedom with your own friends? Hmm?

DONKEY: But, uh, I don't have any friends. And I'm not goin' out there by myself. Hey, wait a minute! I got a great idea! I'll stick with you. You're a mean, green, fightin' machine. Together we'll scare the spit out of anybody that crosses us.

Shrek turns and regards Donkey for a moment before loudly roaring in is face.

DONKEY: Oh, wow! That was really scary. If you don't mind me sayin', if that don't work, your breath certainly will get the job done, 'cause you definitely need some Tic Tacs or something, 'cause your breath stin"
537,"The Forest is a little out dated and some features are clunky, but over all this is a good game. It mixes horror, tension, survival crafting and exploration rather well and has plenty of replay value!"

639,"Game is not bad, but

Mechanics feel very disconnected
there are 3 main mechanics in the game:
- base building
- story processing
- survival

and it feels like devs were trying to figure out the game while releasing it

and if initially it shuold have been base-building survival
then later they switched to story focused action game

so these two parts are very disconnected and half-developed

base building is pretty superficial and in the end - meaningless
in Valheim, for example, you have your ""primary base of operations"" and ""supplementary bases"", and all of them make sense - you have to constantly teleport between them, gather resources etc

here you build the base, then figure out there is a story, and just abandon the base and go through the story

storyteling is really undeveloperd.
you find some peaces of ""info"", which gives you zero info in actuality, so you basically just ""search for trophies"" with no point at all (except of couple minor things)


in the end thats how you gameplay looks:
- you spend first day building the base
- second day to figure out how to develop a base
- figure out there is story content
- abandon the base
- go through the cases in order to finish the story

thats it"
640,not bad
641,"Played this game with my cuz and beat it on all difficulties. There was a lot of running, screaming, crying, raging, and chaos. 10/10, would play 10 more times"

648,"If you're looking for a nice little survival game where cannibals are a constant threat, The Forest is the best! (Wow, it rhymes!) It's really fun to play it together with friends and scream whenever a cannibal appears within sight or when said friend forgot to scream ""Timber!"" when they chop up trees in front of you."

Game good its fun but it requires friends for fun or you have to play internet servers. Game time is infinite but it can get boring after some time. Also i don't recommend speedrunning it when you just started the game because you will get to op and it will be boring. Recommending adding some mods!

797,"The mouse was super sensitive and spun out of control when first playing, even reducing mouse sensitivity didn't help much. When trying to cut down trees, some of them glitched and just floated even after cutting all the way through.

The game really throws you in at the deep end and you really feel like you have to learn all the controls as quickly as possible in order to survive. I did try playing this with my partner but we didn't really enjoy it, I imagine it's a lot more enjoyable with a bigger group of friends.

814,"Description: A gory first person game in a forest filled with cannibals.

Pros:
+ Good Graphics 
+ Convincing Atmosphere 
+ Realistic Feeling Enemies
+ Online Co-op

Cons:
- Repetitive Gameplay
- Building is Irrelevant
- Survival is an Afterthought
- Confusing Inventory System
- Poorly Optimized 

Details: 
While the game definitely looks amazing, and the atmosphere really sells the survival horror element well, the game suffers from a lack of content induced by repetitive gameplay.

There is really only two things you can do in this game. You either go underground to explore identical looking caves, or you stay above ground and get zerged by cannibals every 5 minutes. Everything else advertised by the game is pretty much irrelevant.

Forget about building large fortresses, as you will get constantly attacked by cannibals whether day or night. You'll end up spending hours constructing even the most modest of bases, only for the cannibals to casually destroy your structures in a few punches.

Don't fret about survival either, as you can simply perform some cannibalism yourself to fill your hunger with virtually no negative consequences, removing any need to hunt, gather, or farm for food. And should that not be enough, there are plenty of edible snacks from other plane passengers simply laying around on the island for you to find.

Exploration might have been interesting, if you weren't constantly forced into encounters with the cannibals. And while the combat isn't exactly ""bad"", it nevertheless only serves to get in the way of story progression.

All in all, if you just wanted a combat heavy game where you fight off waves of cannibals over and over, then this might be the game for you. But if you want to do anything else you would expect from a game of this genre, like building, exploring, and surviving, then this game is simply not it.

Rating: 2.5 / 5.0"

816,is cannibalism on a cannibal really cannibalism?

830,"This game is pretty interesting. It has a decent story line but can be a little confusing when trying to figure out where you need to start. I also never knew where to get a map when I first started playing this game and that alone could cost you in a survival type game such as this. If you like zombies, prepare to be amazed at their skins. I would recommend playing this game with friends."
831,frendly neighbours :)
832,"Fun with friends, probably wouldn't recommend for a singleplayer playthrough. If there was a 'neutral' option I'd definitely rate it that. Overall, a laugh with friends (apart from that TERRIBLE final boss battle), but not something to play if you want a serious survival experience. Looking forward to sons of the forest, that game looks really promising."
833,"I played this game
I am gay
coincidence?"
834,I enjoy the game as only having it for like a week to two weeks

847,"I can't believe, why this game has 95% positive reviews?!? From over 300k people?!? It is at best a mediocre game. I would not recommend it to anyone. I only played it longer than 4 hours, because I'm playing it together with my friends.

Pros:
- The game utilizes real darkness, which I would like in general

Cons (there are a lot, just to name the most annoying):
- Zombies are constantly spawning and attacking you - very annoying
- Fighting is totally uninteresting and boring
- The game should be renamed to ""The Cave"", as you are in caves most of the time
- Caves are completely dark, which I would like, but the light sources are terrible or do even blind you even more. You really can't see anything and the cave experience is really unpleasent
- The game is buggy, but I encountered nothing game breaking at least (the level of polish is kinda late early access stage)
- In multiplayer, every player has to manually save in bases or random tents (otherwise -> rollback)
- The inventory system is a horrible gimmick
- The building system is horrible and building in general is completely useless
- Crafting is completely useless and very tedious (everything you really need is found in caves in masses)

TL;DR
To sum it up the game breaks down to a story/exploration game in complete darkness with bad and useless survival and building elements thrown on top of it, where the story is cryptic and the exploration is no fun."
848,this game is alright I mean it is hard for me because I am not very good at this game but it is not horrible

857,"TOP- survival-horror game with egoshooter-elements, crafting & hack¬¥n¬¥slay. Recommendable for coop- and basebuilding-fans ! Cannibal- content included. Hidden secrets can be found on the mysterious open-world island. Big respect and thanks to the publisher! They are not greedy for money - so they gave us a free upgrade to play this with VR-Elements. Other publishers would let us pay for this!"

859,"Very Graphic game, if is thet expensive, ""Shut up and get my money!"""
860,pogger
861,Fantastiskt 10/10
862,"After finishing the game I can not recommend. Apart the casual cannibalism and couple wtf moments which I quite enjoyed the game is lacking and put simply - half baked. Mechanics were abandoned (such as sanity), never ending waves of cannibals on a tiny island, only real story elements are present in the last hour of playthrough (not that it makes much sense anyway - why would be little Timmy's drawings and toys all over the place), meh combat, AI and animations.. I suspect the ""overwhelmingly positive"" overall reviews are due to body horror and cannibalism elements.

Dunno, might just be me - I expected more.

P.S. It is called the Forest but you spend so much time in caves! Misleading advertisement - 0/10"
863,if u play with your friends is gonna feel like you are in heaven
864,"Nice ambience, shame about the game"
865,Nice
866,you kill naked people
867,"I've only played it on 'No Enemies' Mode so far because I just wanted to chill out and play First Person Runescape.

I have to warn you all, it's VERY addictive! If someone asked me what I did yesterday, the answer ''What day was it?'' Is not unusual.

Easy to get top level Graphic Settings on an older PC and there are many guides online for new people. (The Guide in the Game is very basic due to the Plane Crash)

I would suggest the game to anyone who just wants to chill out and survive on safe mode.

The mode with Eaters of The Flesh may be more challenging and somewhat less relaxing.

This.. THIS right here is a great example of Lovecraftian horror, the the exception that you can actually fight it, for the most part. some of the hidden caves with random drawing, the ""church"" you can build. it's all creepy and defies explanation, I love it!        a lot of the story is just kinda left up in the air, and i personally hope they don't fill in those gaps with random bullshit, I hope they just leave it.
Where did the ""Artifact"" come from? why does it do these things? where is this unlimited power coming from? . . . Midichlorians! :\  that's the answer you want?

playing it with a friend is the only way i was able to complete this game, some of the splunking bullshit in the water caves. . . goddamn nightmare fuel!"

I really enjoyed playing the game on the Multiplayer mode with some friends.
There's still some glitches that the player is always exposed to.
I highly recommend to purchase The Forest. 
It's worth-buying 'cause the open world that you're forced to live with has many things to look at.
You're always going to look for new crafts, materials, weapons, secrets, etc.
A long run, but a nice one.

989,"It's pretty fun at times, but horribly uninutitive when it comes to the UI and objectives. The game doesn't tell you when you've cleared the caves fully and the crafting system should've been reworked. As well as the inventory, it's some gimmicky inventory screen instead of a traditional easy-to-use inventory, when you wanna drop food for example you have to combine it with a metal tray to give it to your friends. It's a dumb feature.

If you play it with your friends it'll be worth it for 10 or so hours before the mystery factor expires. Then it's just repetitive classic survival gameplay like Valheim."

1007,awsome
1008,taps
1009,"It's not entirely a bad game, but i expected far more.

What bothered me most is that your lightsources illuminate your surroundings far to little compared to how much they blind you while holding them. And since a huge part of this game is about exploring dark caves this is unbearable.

It started of great and was quite scary for a time. But the creatures became more an annoyance than a threat or spook very quickly.
Basebuilding is tedious especially since you're almost nonstop bothered by creatures.
I really can't say what the appeal of this game is supposed to be. There aren't too many aspects in it and yet almost all of them seemed rather lackluster.
The only thing i liked were the creatures but their attacks were just too frequently.
[spoiler] A creature standing in front of me just to dodge a headshot of mine by tilting it's head was really smooth! [/spoiler]"
1010,"Awesome game, just needs more graphical glitches fixes, like rolling destroyed entity, sudden darkness, the torch being more blinding than actually helping you see through the night, a spinning cut-down tree, and many more."

The custom builds allow you to make some cool stuff and the varied gear is also good for different situations and play styles. 

Is fun in single player but 100% better playing with friends!"
1069,Nice
1070,"I really enjoy this game but it could be so much better. Graphics are good, game play is a bit hard to learn at first and it is difficult to really fight others. But over all a really good game to pass the time. Don't like the fact that every time you save and come back in, everything re-spawns."

1096,good
1097,I've played this game for only 5 hours and I'm already hooked. It's easy to pick up and fun to play with friends. Would recommend!
1098,"I am a 45 yo father, probably one of the oldest people playing this game. I am a single farther to my Son, who is 14 now. My son got this game, so we installed it on his computer and he started playing. By the end of the week he had 18 hours on this game. This was horrible for me, as it was already hard for me to find ways to spend time with my son, as he is always out with his friends or just, watching YouTube. So i decided to make a Steam account and get this game to see if I could maybe play alongside him. loaded into the game, made my character and world and started playing but I was stuck on what you where supposed to do. I asked my Son for help and he hosted a game for me to join. loved it as it was the best time had spent with my Son since my wife had died. This game has ever since brought me and my son closer again and now we actually spend time together outside the house together as well. This game reminded me that there's fun to be had in everything, and it has brought both me and my Son many happy memories"
1099,One of the best survival games to date. The atmosphere is top notch and the story is pretty well written.
1100,gopd
1101,the best survival game ever

1107,"one of the best games out there. an absolutely phenomenal story that concludes with you feeling fulfilled, yet still has you eagerly waiting for the sequel. A simply stellar combination of a balanced story, building system and combat. The advanced AI of the cannibals makes every playthrough something different, and the building is enough work to feel accomplished, but not too grindy. The atmosphere of the beautiful landscapes, and terrifying yet intriguing cave systems are unmatched in any other open world story game. While a little bit buggy, it is entirely understandable from an indie game studio, especially with Sons of the Forest on its way. I have never in my entire life been more excited for a game to release, and few games have been able to create such an amazing story, environment, combat, and building mechanics in one game, especially an indie game studio. The game is wonderful and exciting in singleplayer, but in mulitplayer it is an absolute masterpiece."
1108,kids
1109,w
1110,yes very good video game i say 10/10 i also want to get the sons of the forest.
1111,I got this game because my brother in law told me to. We have completed the game several times and we kept trying to do everything the game has to offer. Can't wait for the second part to come out soon!

1119,Best survival game ive played so far.
1120,e
1121,Great Game.
1122,"It's a fun game but should not be priced at 19.99 for the state of the game it's in. This game has a ton of bugs. Several game mechanics are unresponsive.

Concerns
- Game is non-linear, first time play-through you'll find yourself wasting a lot of time going back because you don't have the required tools to proceed.
- I don't understand why they couldn't of just made a simple hotkey system.
- Some items get in the way of others when picking them up, a pick up customizable filter would of been nice.
- Axe doesn't always hit luggage, misses trees often, when you run out of stamina while swinging you get stuck in the animation anyways (this should have been fixed along time ago...)
- Re-breather auto-equips at times where you don't need it and you start freezing just because you entered the water with it.
- Picking up things like pictures animation is buggy as if you swap items it will swap back to the picture (this should of been fixed along time ago...)
- Stamina drain is a bit much
- Can only rotate buildings 1 way.
- Underwater blurriness I would rank as one of the top worst design choices I've ever seen in video games.

Despite these things, there are some mods that make this game much more enjoyable."

"
1145,game
1146,good game
1147,The game starts of kind of slow as you're trying to get your feet on the ground. Crash landing. Son gone. Then you see your first real encounter with the natives... and you panic... quickly trying to find a place to set up your smaller base... fast forward a couple nights you're starting to get your life together. Base is coming along and getting bigger... bigger brings more attention... more natives... and likely mutants at this point... you hear them stomping around in the forest... you're hiding behind your walls... panicking... they leave you alone for now... so you start venturing out and find caves and its just terrifying... panicking always... you see a lot of mutants... you leave.. you go back to your base... and more mutants come... destroy your base.... no more base... 10/10 would recommend.
1148,"nice game
"
1149,"A near Perfect game. If you have yet to play this game, do yourself a favor and do so. You can even play with a friend that lives in the jewel of South East Asia. Thank you Fatal for gifting me this game and who basically was my guide on the peninsula. - R

1176,"The Forest is a unique experience, the studio behind it is seriously passionate about the project and it shows. Deep lore (to a creepy level), fitting OST, great immersion and ambience. The building system could use some improvements as it's quite limiting. I think the game is worth the full price for sure, and I cannot wait to see how the sequel will play out. One thing that I must definitely add is that this and Phasmophobia are probably my two favourite horror-esque video-games to co-op with friends. The immersion remains, even with friends. Great work Endnight!"

1182,Fun game to play with your friends
1183,Addicting
1184,Good Game
1185,"Very interesting game. Its hard to get into it in the begging, since you have no clues to anything. Its up to the player to explore the map and find resources, items and hints as to what is happening.

Be aware, it is a somewhat big world, with lots of caves and exploration to do. But it feels very rewarding when you finally start to make some sense out of things. The lore of the game is quite amazing, although most of it is discovered more towards the end-game. 

I'd advise to use find some guides/tutorials on the internet to make it a slightly easier experience. The mechanics of the game might be a little broken, but they're also quite in-depth, so you'll probably find other things that you can do with the items by looking around the web.

Overall it's a very fun and interesting experience if you're willing to put in the time to figure out the story for yourself it."

1203,Timmy ugly as shit
1204,this game is great good graphics runs smooth and i enjoy exploring fighting and building with my friends with the easy to use online options i can easily play with friends or even make new ones and the story line could not have been more interesting almost all the cut scenes where very interesting and kept me on the edge of my chair great game and its crazy that it was only made by 4 people i would highly recommend great detail to attention on animations and small details and so much to do with a good sized map and a wide variety of weapons to mach your fighting style there are multiple great features that make me love this game even more like the animation of the lighter going out makes me amazed how much effort was put into these details in all this game is great lots to explore very social and the mechanics are impeccable in all you should get it and i hope i see you in the game sometime
1205,"not worth the price but still awesome, the price should be at least $5.99 to $10.99"
1206,"It's good. Not anything I can say that hasn't already been said. You might see some occasional glitches; nothing game breaking from what I've seen.
The enemy ai is impressive, and if I'm wrong about that, the game does a damn good job of making you think it's impressive."
1207,its good if you like survival games and zombies/creatures games this is it and the forest 2 is coming out soon so if you want to buy it you can but the smarter option is wait for the forest 2
1208,this is a very fun game and though its a bit weird to figure out the controls once you figure it out its really cool.
1209,"This game had me on my toes the entire time. Very fun, very addicting, and so much to do. Impressive game!"
1210,"Holy Crap. I haven't had a game scratch the explore and craft itch like this since subnautica.  This game is amazing. Graphically it isn't the most outstanding, but the story and the map building are insane."
1211,Fun.
1212,A great game i cant wait for the second one.
1213,"I recently discovered this game by watching a couple of youtubers and became intrigued, especially knowing that they are about to soon release the sequel Sons of the Forest. How to articulate that the building system is just amazing, although it has some nuances with people coming into your server to basically crash it using mods even if you have cheats off. THE STORY!! OH YEAH!! You can really get lost in surviving and building that you might forget about the story, but it's actually a good story.."
1214,This game is very human.I like this game.Nice game.
1215,alt tab breaks the game
1216,GOOD
1217,"Fun game, highly recommend having friends though"
1218,yes
1219,Pretty good game
1220,"First time buying this game even though I really wanted to buy another thing but I never regret it because first time I played this game was with my friend (really recommended for if you have friends that you can play with).
I played the game for 8 hours straight with my friend and it was fun so I really recommend this game"
1221,survival game but against your creepy uncles
1222,This game has an awesome story and you can do so many things. I really like this game and you guys should play it
1223,this is ghood
1224,fun :D
1225,"This game is awesome, one of the best games ive ever played. Truly immersive gameplay for hours of fun, especially with friends."
1226,This game is so god.it's funny to play with friends
1227,"Gimme-gimme log, gimme-gimme log :>"
1228,"Got the game on sale for like $10, was really surprised at how much I enjoyed it.  The story is decent and the gameplay is fun.  One of the better survival games I have played.   I found both singleplayer and multiplayer to be enjoyable.  Camping out with your boys and eating humans flesh together is fun."
1229,"Dont grind, just complete the story"
1230,Great game to play with friends or alone.
1231,It is good
1232,gud
1233,this is one of the funnest survival games ever and i would totally recommend if you like zombie type survival game and i know there not called zombie and there  not zombie and way totally recommend  this game.
1234,amazing survival horror
1235,"Game is especially fun with friends. Don't know the lore or anything. I wasn't paying attention. If you throw dynamite at monster, monster go boom. Axe go chop."
1236,bro i hate going camping in ohio üíÄüíÄüíÄ
1237,"If you have no time to waste, and you give this game a chance... Its actually not too bad of a game. But for people who are into FPS, Battle Royales, and are searching for The Adrenaline Rush, This game isn't for you. Otherwise, Its a great game once you learn the basics, and let your Creativity go Wild."
1238,Final broxante :thumbsup
1239,"Great game
"
1240,ehh ja
1241,stole a book now being mauled to death
1242,"Pretty good mixture of survival, thrill and story"
1243,"Any time there is a forest in any game/place i visit i immediately think of this game and say ""omg is that THE FOREST???"" I have lost my mind"
1244,"the island is a great place to stay!
pros: great views, lots of wildlife, free from society, a nice science fair if you look in the right place, great place for children
cons: natives are a bit touchy, caves are dangerous if children are left unattended and why are there so many weapons lying around?

I got here by plane with a bit of turbulence, but after me and my son were perfectly fine."
1245,"Most of the objectives in the game are basically: ""Roam around on the map until you stumble into what you need to find"". I feel like progression is not really there. I don't know where to go, what to do. I'm too weak to fighter larger enemies, and I have no idea how to get stronger. I've had the same gear since day 2."
1246,hahah head chopping go brrr
1247,cool
1248,gud
1249,"My name is Walter Hartwell White. I live at 308 Negra Arroyo Lane, Albuquerque, New Mexico, 87104. This is my confession. If you're watching this tape, I'm probably dead, murdered by my brother-in-law Hank Schrader. Hank has been building a meth empire for over a year now and using me as his chemist. Shortly after my 50th birthday, Hank came to me with a rather, shocking proposition. He asked that I use my chemistry knowledge to cook methamphetamine, which he would then sell using his connections in the drug world. Connections that he made through his career with the DEA. I was... astounded, I... I always thought that Hank was a very moral man and I was... thrown, confused, but I was also particularly vulnerable at the time, something he knew and took advantage of. I was reeling from a cancer diagnosis that was poised to bankrupt my family. Hank took me on a ride along, and showed me just how much money even a small meth operation could make. And I was weak. I didn't want my family to go into financial ruin so I agreed. Every day, I think back at that moment with regret. I quickly realized that I was in way over my head, and Hank had a partner, a man named Gustavo Fring, a businessman. Hank essentially sold me into servitude to this man, and when I tried to quit, Fring threatened my family. I didn't know where to turn.
Eventually, Hank and Fring had a falling out. From what I can gather, Hank was always pushing for a greater share of the business, to which Fring flatly refused to give him, and things escalated. Fring was able to arrange, uh I guess I guess you call it a ""hit"" on my brother-in-law, and failed, but Hank was seriously injured, and I wound up paying his medical bills which amounted to a little over $177,000. Upon recovery, Hank was bent on revenge, working with a man named Hector Salamanca, he plotted to kill Fring, and did so. In fact, the bomb that he used was built by me, and he gave me no option in it. I have often contemplated suicide, but I'm a coward. I wanted to go to the police, but I was frightened. Hank had risen in the ranks to become the head of the Albuquerque DEA, and about that time, to keep me in line, he took my children from me. For 3 months he kept them. My wife, who up until that point, had no idea of my criminal activities, was horrified to learn what I had done, why Hank had taken our children. We were scared. I was in Hell, I hated myself for what I had brought upon my family. Recently, I tried once again to quit, to end this nightmare, and in response, he gave me this. I can't take this anymore. I live in fear every day that Hank will kill me, or worse, hurt my family. I... All I could think to do was to make this video in hope that the world will finally see this man, for what he really is"

1253,"This is one of the more cohesive survival games I have seen. Most of everything is interactable in some way, the enemies are well-made and the building system is quite complex. Overall, a really good experience"
1254,"nice game
"
1255,"The Forest Is absolutely one of the games of all time, Specially when timmy said ""It's Timmin' time"" sent chills all over my spine 11/2"
1256,if you wanna play a game where you eat human body parts to survive go for it. Cool crafting game fun caves to explore and find new exciting weapons. just dont go out at night warning you will get bum raped  XD
1257,Great fun meeting and eating the locals along with chopping down every tree in a 10 mile radius
1258,Very fun! Creepy and always something new to make you feel like your life is in danger. Crafting is pretty solid as well
1259,hi
1260,Bagus
1261,"Lookup Farket on YouTube for the best gameplay on this game. It's fun, and kinda spooky. A good survival, base-building, horrorish game."
1262,"""Once I went to the fridge, saw our jug in there and I thought, ""What's in it?"". A syrup. What syrup? Smell it: *sniffs* Mmm! Smells nice.

What a drink! So I drank the lot. *sluuurrp* *tongue-click*"""

1265,"Pretty good game, although the rabbits can go f*ck themselves. 10/10, unless you eventually find out there is a rabbit trap, then you will need 31/31. Expensive? Maybe. But you know what's more expensive? Not knowing there is a way to pick up the rabbit from the trap, so you try to stab it through the damn thing, destroying your trap and having to find another THIRTY ONE f*cking sticks. Honestly one of the best experiences I've ever had in a game. Now YOU go try it."
1266,"Such a good group game with friends! There's a general story line you can follow if and when you like, and otherwise it's just a great and sometimes scary open world!"
1267,"This game is amazing. Although, I recommend surviving with friends. Its much easier to survive. Cant wait for the second game to be released. But meanwhile if you dont already have the game, download it now!"
1268,yes

1273,very fun loved killing people and animals

1277,"[b] Introduction [/b]
The Forest is a game like no other. It provides a mix of realistic survival, horror, combat, building, and story in one nice package. If you are a fan of other realistic survival games like Stranded Deep then The Forest will not feel much different in terms of graphics and survival. You have your standard food, water, energy, and health bars that you have to manage and straight-forward crafting system. Moreover, you can build some pretty impressive creations with the building system but it is a very time consuming process to get all the necessary materials. 

[b] Horror [/b]
The horror elements of the game are very strong early on but tend to fade as time goes on. Unfortunately the cannibals and late mutants of the game, while quite terrifying in visual design, lack in the AI department. After your firs couple encounters with the cannibals, you will find that they become pretty stale to fight against. There isn't much variation in how the enemies fight you and can be downright annoying in their inconsistent and somewhat dumb AI. This isn't to say that the enemies fall completely flat as they still do a good job in providing a sense of dread in the player. I just would've liked to see them behave with less clunkyness. 

Another aspect of horror and spooky factor that the game excels in are the caves you have to explore. There are 10+ underground caves that you have to explore to progress the story of the game. Along the way you get better equipment and find clues about the lore and story of the game. I must say that the level designer of the caves did a great job! I really felt like I was in an actual cave system and enjoyed using the map to track my progress. However, one big downside to the caves was the abysmal light sources provided to the player. Your lighter that you get is pathetic and barely provided enough illumination to see your own body. You do find a flashlight that helps with seeing further out in front of you, but the batteries are scarce and drain quickly. I really would've liked to see some better lighting options in the game. I get that having things dark helps set the atmosphere but the default settings for the game are just too dark. I had to turn up the brightness settings in caves to about 1/3 from the default 0/3 setting. This helped and still required me to use the flashlight to get around. 

[b] Combat [/b]
The combat in this game is both very satisfying and equally frustrating. Pretty much everything can be used as a weapon but as with most games on of them are actually worth a damn. Something that really started to drive me nuts while playing was the poor animation telegraphing from the enemies. Anyone that has played dark souls knows exactly what I am talking about when I say how crucial it is to be able to read your enemies attacks. Many times the cannibals would do attacks that wouldn't look like they hit me but somehow did. On the flip-side, many of my attacks would fail to hit as the hitboxes for the weapons are small and quite difficult to connect with the enemy. Some weapons like the spear are borderline useless because of how the hitboxes function. I definitely don't think the combat is bad but it lacks polish and can feel repetitive as all fights pretty much boil down to either shoot them with arrows and throw bombs or hit them as fast as possible with a melee weapon.

[b] Building [/b]
The building elements of the game are weaved into the survival aspects with structures such as water collectors and drying racks. However, you can also build you own custom structures or some pre-built ones. While this seems great and fun to do at first, you will quickly realize that base building has very little impact on the game and is, in my opinion, actually more frustrating than worth it. The game requires you to perform the tedious task of collecting all of your resources to build defensive walls, rock walls, and wood walls. Though in the end all you get to put in your structures are decorations, a bed, and a fire. There are no workbenches like other survival games and thus base-building is mainly for the more creative folks and not a requirement of progression in the game. Note you do need to build a shelter to save and sleep. This can be done quite cheaply and doesn't require defenses to ensure its survival.

If you watch the trailer for the game then you wouldn't be wrong in thinking that making traps to defend you base is a big part of the game. Thought the is far from the truth. The cannibals and mutants don't actually attack your structures unless you are around them. This lead me to not even bothering continuing to make my main base as it was easier to just fight the enemies in the open with some traps. Moreover, the traps themselves basically have a 1/4 chance of actually working as intended. Most the time the enemies just glitch past them but still set them off. The only exception to this is the deadfall trap which you can use to kill all the enemies quite easily with if you build a few in a line. 

[b] Story [/b]
Last but certainly not least to cover is the story. I honestly think that this is more fascinating part of the game that really set it apart from all your other survival games. The Forest is careful to never share too much about the plot. It uses very few cutscenes and rather relies on video tapes, notes, and your own observations to infer what is going on. You do get a lot of closure at the end of the game which left me feeling very satisfied and excited for Sons Of The Forest. I wish more games used the storytelling techniques of The Forest to keep you immersed.

One potential downside to the way The Forest handles the story is its asymmetry. There are very few actually blockers in place to prevent you from exploring the caves in all sorts of different orders. You will eventually reach the end of the game the same way, but the caves themselves all have unique rewards for exploring them. I feel like this can be frustrating to the player as without much direction, you may find yourself making things harder than they need to be. A good example of this is the map that can be found in one of the caves. There is no guarantee the player will explore that cave first and get the map. Thus they may spend most of the game exploring without even having a map for the caves! That sounds that a very frustrating experience and may even turn some people off from the game.

[b] Performance [/b]
It should go without saying that you need a beefy PC to play this game at high graphics. However, there isn't much a of a disclaimer regarding hard bad this game actually runs. I pretty much had a lot of stuttering while I walked around on the above ground area and it got to be almost every other second when fighting lots of enemies. While this is not game breaking, it is very annoying and is unacceptable for a 3070 and i7 10700K and with the game on an SSD. I suspect the devs that made didn't know much about optimizing it and it seems that newer tech hasn't really helped it making it run better. 


[b] Conclusion [/b]
I think overall this game is definitely something you should play is your like survival games. The story engaging and original which is a real breath of fresh air in the gaming world. It seems like this game could've done with some more experienced developers when it comes to optimization, AI, and some of the pacing & balancing. However, EndNight hasn't been in the game dev industry long. Hopefully Sons Of The Forest will be everything this game could've been and more!

1287,"~90 minutes in and so far, this is one of the most infuriating games to play right off the bat. Building and collecting is fun, but don't expect to be able to do very rudimentary things like drink water from a freshwater river directly (using your hands or just sticking your face in is not possible) and put rocks down. Like, just let go of the rock. You can't remove most items from your inventory for no reason. You are required to make a storage to stockpile anything. There are things that don't have storage like body parts, so I hope you're cool with being forced to carry rotten limbs around. You can't just have a pile on the ground. There is a guidebook to build buildings, but there is nothing to tell you how to craft specific things in your inventory. Enemies start out way too strong even on the lowest difficulty with four people. Two hits, you're down, zombies take 10+ hits with the axe, like 7 with a club made of bone (??? axe is supposed to be able to remove limbs, but a club is more powerful for some reason). 4 of us got wiped twice in less than 60 seconds because there was non-stop spawning for an entire day and night cycle. Spawning is random so night time is pointless, exists only to prevent you from doing anything but fight around your campfire for 20+ minutes at a time because it's impossible to see otherwise. Animals sometimes run away from you, sometimes they just chill and have no awareness of your presence so you just walk up and whack em dead. When the game is in fullscreen, somehow the cursor isn't confined to the game so if you look too far in any direction and click, your game minimizes and you maximize and you're dead because you were trying to fight 10 zombies.  It takes almost 90 logs just to build the log cabin so I hope you enjoy doing tedious and repetitive shit for an hour before you can even start to not die and play the game. Not to mention you need walls that are a log a piece. Cannibals also knock them down with a couple hits so it's hardly helpful. All these glaring issues are prominent in less than 90 minutes of gameplay. Trees have a weird hitbox, sometimes you hit them, sometimes you don't and you've been standing in the same place the whole time. Bugs galore, clipping, animation glitching, randomly launching characters/items, falling through the world, etc. Basic shit that shouldn't be present in a 4yo game that is supposed to be updated. Nothing anymore is released as-is so this shit is unacceptable. This game needs serious work yet it will never receive the TLC it needs. Going to keep playing, hopefully mid/late game is less shitty."
1288,"No replayability.. pretty boring after the first couple hours.. Once you get the basic mechanics down, there isn't much else to do.. Not much to explore.. Just so boring lol. I'm sure if this had mod support, it'd be 10x better."
1289,daddy
1290,This game is good
1291,good game just seems like it need a new content update
1292,"Compared to many of the Games out there this one is superb - they get a lot of things right. One has to focus on many things at once but it does not become tedious or overwhelming. There is a lot of replayability even though there is one map because each time you start over you can go anywhere you wand and build whatever you want which adds for much variation. 

The Forest Wiki has much needed information in it. There is no tutorial and though there should be at this point there is no basic getting started guide. 

One of the most important thing is to go to Options > Graphics > Color Grading and set this on TEXAS - you may not like this one the best as there are about 20 different options .. leaving things on default provide a pitch black night for the most part. 

In order to not get slaughtered by the bad guys you will need to research this online about hot to fight in close quarters combat or figure it out for yourself. 

THIS IS NOT TURNBASED  BUT IS REAL TIME AND CLOSE QUARTERS IN YOUR FACE COMBAT. 

So if you like this sort of thing great. 

Spoiler Alert:  - The enemy .... They never ever get wiped out .. it would be great if there were a fixed number of bad guys or repawns for the enemy if this was an option. Also you are basically in constant combat so if you play solo it can be overwhelming. 

Multijplayer is a completely different experience worth pursuing after Singleplayer but overall could be better. 

So Compared to other games regarding the menus and how to do stuff Great,  Replayability Great, Learn all the cheats which is explained in the Wiki this way you can tailor it to how you want it. 

Learn the Hidding game setup options ... 

You can enemy only come out at night if ya want some peace and quiet, ya can have no enemies, you can have building destruction on or off so all your hard work does not get destroyed in seconds. 

So you can play this your way the only downfall though and its a major one the enemy cannot be extinct. 

There is a story mode which you can easily get pulled away from as you find yourself having other concerns."

1331,"I cannot recommend this game enough. It is hands down one of my favourite that I have played. The atmosphere and story are so immersive. Played for hours on end and has great replay value. This game really is amazing, definitely recommend!"

1336,good
1337,cannibal go brrrrrr
1338,"I Highly Recommand this game if you are looking for a Open world game. The story is very simple (spoiler alert) You a survival expert and your son (Timmy) go and travel with a plane(the location is not revealed)
Then the plane crashes and you are the only survivor. You fin yourself stranded on a strange island and full of cannibals and mutants. your Only goal in life is to find Timmy. You eventually fin a laboratory in which experiments were done on kids under the circumstances of ""curing cancer"" (or something like that)
And then you fin Timmy and he is Dead:(  And you discover that you need a sacrifice to get him back .
You go fight megan (a child that was revived using timmy as a sacrifice)
you kill her and then you try to use her but you discover that you need a living sacrfice.
After that you go and fin a control room. There you make the big decision either you destrou the plane and take a living sacrfice and revive Timmy(this is the cannon ending) accept that Timmy is dead and try to move on.Once again very cool game .

1339,Can't wait for sons of forest!!
1340,"Totally recommended. Very fun camping simulator. Also there' a kid or something, IDK..."
1341,"They were right, there is a forest"
1342,"This game is hilarious when you play with friends.  Some of the mutants are pretty easy, but can completely wreck your house.  You might want to be careful when dealing with monsters like the Handsy.  My only gripe is the existence of the worm.  It's difficult to deal with because constantly replicates and will one shot almost every structure you have.  My suggestion is to save your game, quit, then reload it.

The worm is a completely broken monster and the game would be better off without it.  Other than that, the game is overall fun because of all the exploration involved."
1343,One of my favorite Survival Crafting games!
1344,I have a son?
1345,This is a great game! fun alone even more fun with freinds! there are so many cool features in this game not sure if they are bugs tho. the only thing i have to complain about is that i could not find the forest. where is it at? in the game? you would think a game called the forest would have a forest in it and not naked cat girls with tails that get fully naked when you solve puzzles i dont understand.
1346,yes
1347,Morgans a bitch
1348,zombie sex game üëç
1349,"In vr this game is an absolute terror inducing horror game.

On flatscreen it is minecraft with rtx on

Still either way it is an amazing game"

[h1]Synopsis[/h1]
The Forest is an open world, crafting, survival, and horror game.

[h1]Story[/h1]
Your plane crash lands on an island. You have survived the crash, but there are no other survivors around when you gain consciousness. You quickly discover that you have to fend for yourself and your landing site is crawling with cannibals looking to make you their meal. 

[h1]Gameplay[/h1]
The remains of the plane can be at different locations, all close to the same area, but different starting experiences. As you emerge from the plane you pick up a Plane Axe and a survival manual that gives you the blueprints to build most of the basic things you need to survive. It includes, fire, shelter, food and water gathering, and much more.

Start off by building yourself some shelter. This is very important as saves are restricted to shelters and the bed. I found the small cabin to be the most convenient shelter, not a lot of materials to build it being the biggest benefit. After you have your shelter you can save your game.

Your book also has a todo list and a notes section. The todo list will be updated with things you need to do in order to progress the story. You start off with some basics, Find Timmy (your son), Set up camp, Find and cook food.

As the game progresses you'll have to build defenses to protect yourself from the cannibals. My personal favorite is the Happy Birthday trap, a wall of spikes that spring up and hit your enemy when they trip it. Even if it doesn't damage or kill them it acts as a wall after it is triggered. Unlike the small cabin, the Happy Birthday traps are expensive to build, but so worth it.

If you fight the cannibals, don't expect a fair fight. Most of the time there will be more than one of them and they don't take turns attacking you. If your health goes down to zero there are two possible outcomes, one you are captured and hung in a cave, like Luke Skywalker on Hoth, or you die and the game ends. It seems that the longer between your losses the more likely you are to end up in the cave.

There are day and night cycles. This was one of my least favorite parts of the game. There is a sleep ability, but it has a timer on it, you can't just sleep through the night, which is something that bothered me. I would understand if you couldn't sleep if cannibals were nearby, but not for an arbitrary timer. Staying up through the night allows you to sleep the next night. There is no penalty, other than food usage for staying up through the night. I found that the night was the perfect time to explore caves as they are going to be dark no matter the time of day.

In addition to the items in the survival manual you can also craft other items like combining two sticks to make a spear. You can create weapons and armor. Unfortunately none of this is covered in the survival manual, I think the game would be a bit better with some kind of crafting guidance.

There are a number of improvements that could be made to the game, such as marking locations on the map. When you build a house or marker it shows up on your screen as an icon in the distance, while this is great to help you find your shelters, it blinds you at night. Being able to mark them on the map and set a way point would be a huge improvement.

At night you can use your lighter to see, it doesn't give much distance. You can find a flashlight that gives you distance, but is focused. You can also craft a torch, unfortunately it isn't held aloft, it is held at eye level essentially blinding you, making it worthless.

[h1]Final Verdict[/h1]
The Forest is a very good survival horror game where you are able to survive if you use your wits. Hearing a cannibal near you in the dark will really get your blood pumping.

1371,"A star is an astronomical object comprising a luminous spheroid of plasma held together by its gravity. The nearest star to Earth is the Sun. Many other stars are visible to the naked eye at night, but their immense distances from Earth make them appear as fixed points of light. The most prominent stars have been categorised into constellations and asterisms, and many of the brightest stars have proper names. Astronomers have assembled star catalogues that identify the known stars and provide standardized stellar designations. The observable universe contains an estimated 1022 to 1024 stars. Still, most are invisible to the naked eye from Earth, including all individual stars outside our galaxy, the Milky Way.

A star's life begins with the gravitational collapse of a gaseous nebula of material composed primarily of hydrogen, along with helium and trace amounts of heavier elements. Its total mass is the main factor determining its evolution and eventual fate. A star shines for most of its active life due to the thermonuclear fusion of hydrogen into helium in its core. This process releases energy that traverses the star's interior and radiates into outer space. At the end of a star's lifetime, its core becomes a stellar remnant: a white dwarf, a neutron star, or‚Äîif it is sufficiently massive‚Äîa black hole.

Stellar nucleosynthesis in stars or their remnants creates almost all naturally occurring chemical elements heavier than lithium. Stellar mass loss or supernova explosions return chemically enriched material to the interstellar medium. These elements are then recycled into new stars. Astronomers can determine stellar properties‚Äîincluding mass, age, metallicity (chemical composition), variability, distance, and motion through space‚Äîby carrying out observations of a star's apparent brightness, spectrum, and changes in its position in the sky over time.

Stars can form orbital systems with other astronomical objects, as in the case of planetary systems and star systems with two or more stars. When two such stars have a relatively close orbit, their gravitational interaction can significantly impact their evolution. Stars can form part of a much larger gravitationally bound structure, such as a star cluster or a galaxy."
1372,"It's fun but only with freinds in my opinion but i still like the game :D

1373,"BERY BOOD
BERY NICE
"
1374,this game is hella fun when playing multiplayer! 10/10
1375,"It's more fun to play with friends (Meat heads to kill things while you build a bunch of effigies) but it's still fun to explore and kill people with chainsaws! Just be careful, there's a reason to be afraid of the dark, and it's not the naked people wearing human leather masks (though they hurt like hell). Tons to explore and build, we're still no where near the end, but that might just be because we like to horde bones and teach the cannibals about art."
1376,"Best open world survival game. As a solo player, it's really challenging and it difficult to beat but I managed to finished the game. The only not good is the multiplayer rooms, they always kick me for no reason. But it doesn't matter, still waiting for the sequel game, love this game :3"
1377,bro does he know how to jump? if not please teach him :))
1378,mutant go brr
1379,the only game where i can be jumped by babys fight off cannibles then die to a human spider
1380,Yes.
1381,Blew up cannibals and accidentally destroyed our hut with a falling tree that no one seemed to notice despite being suddenly homeless
1382,yes
1383,"Great multiplayer fun and even better single player horror/survival game. very fun with friends building a base, and defending against waves of monsters. exploring the cave systems and the forest at night by yourself is the best yet gameplay experience-wise, and keeps me coming back to explore the forest more."

1385,raah
1386,this is wonderful game and i'm really enjoy it
1387,"Naked men chased me around the woods.

1391,"Kaaaddduuuuuu

1392,Reject humanity. Build base. Forget son. Dance around the fire. Become a respectable cannibal. Never go home.
1393,"Canibals come to eat me, but I ate them. Very good game:)"
1394,"This game seems like it will be good, but in the end is lackluster in pretty much every category. 

The survival mechanics seem quite fun at first, but they quickly lose their depth. Resources are plentiful and very easy to obtain, leaving no challenge in the attempt to survive at all. Alongside that, things such as items within suitcases respawning frequently and animals being very easy to kill by just running at them take a lot of the feeling of authenticity, as well as any aspects of resource management or progression out of the game. After one gets a 2 or 3 days into the game, survival is just a chore with no purpose. 

Which moves onto the second part of the game, which is cave exploration. Cave after cave after cave. This is where the combat and horror aspects come into play... but like the survival it also falls flat. The AI is bad, to the point where it feels like just running past them is the best option. The enemies aren't easy, but they feel like they are just a hindrance rather than a threat or something to strategically deal with. 

Overall, this game starts off feeling great, like it could be a really fun survival adventure. But, once one has played it for a while it just constantly feels like it falls flat."
1395,"Great survival game, fun co-op."
1396,good game :)
1397,"fun to ply with friends, but not for SINGLEPLAYER.
"
1398,"Good ,scaryy , atractive, survival , and hard game :)"
1399,chum n fum
1400,love it
1401,"definitely a game if your looking for a harder experience with an interesting and unique building system, this game dives face first into exploration without completely holding your hand, it has the perfect balance between difficulty and fun"
1402,Awesome game!
1403,There is over 20 glitches in this game and it genuinely just makes it more fun !!MNJOKJI!HOI!H!H!!!!
1404,I love it! More treehouses :D
1405,Amazing.
1406,"love this game! it has a lot going for it from ease of play to understanding the basics. 
there are a few down sides though which really are not that bad. (so maybe more like suggestions?)
maybe add more types of animals (bears?) and have more uses for the skins. Once you have played for awhile you will end up with so many you dont have a use for. ( maybe animal skin clothing? that need repaired over time?) then you would have a use for the extra skins. (also bear skin rugs would be cool) also maybe different ways of building or different building needs based on location? (ex. in the snow you would need blankets etc.) PLEASE FIX THE ROOFS!!!!! the mechanics for them are terrible. 

Most play this game and follow the story line but what do you do after you have beat the game? so maybe add in some basic stuff to do (think adult looking minecraft!!!) lol. Also perhaps adding in a bigger map for those of us who simply want to kick back in a tree house and kill a lizard. 

This was more of a list of hopeful updates. This game can have a lot added to it without taking away from the basic story line and over all game play.  (dear developers feel free to contact me on my running list of ideas!)"
1407,A little buggy but good
1408,horror minecraft that makes me scream when i see the monster
1409,"I got this on sale for $5 but I would of easily paid $40 if I had experienced the game ahead of time. Honestly, I had never heard of it until a Steam sale a week ago. But the game is well made with a good level of grind and fight and a fairly forgiving save system. It also has a story that you want to follow, but at the same time are easily distracted by crafting and exploring. As time progresses the fights get tougher but never something I have not been able to adapt too with new tools and weapons."
1410,fun
1411,<3
1412, .
1413,"Ran out of oxygen in the last cave and died, couldn't get my stuff back, including the rebreather, since my backpack was stranded deep underwater. Can't get deep underwater without the rebreather. Tracked back through the cave after barely surviving hackily sidling down the edge of the sinkhole, only to find out that the spare rebreather I saw further back in the cave was purely decorative and could not be picked up. Absolute broken f***ery."
1414,jh
1415,very good game to play it with your friends i dont have so you can play it alone if you want i guess
1416,"i just played 8 hrs straight , got lost in a cave , got hit by my traps MULTIPLE times and killed enough turtles to start a world wide P.E.T.A war ..... 10/10 would recommend."
1417,pretty goog

1420,stop reading reviews and just play this game already. 10/10

1442,"such a fantastic game, i would defo reconemnd"
1443,i eat men for a living
1444,I've had a great time playing this game on my and even more so with friends. You can build a giant fortress or go on the offensive and go after the creepy things that go bump in the forest. An all around fun game to play. You will get a few good scares in before you get the confidence to take on the forest creatures.
1445,"Excellent Game overall. A few bugs and annoyances, ex) I wish the items displayed names, I never know if I am putting raw meat or dried meat on the drying racks. Can't wait for the sequel!"
1446,slow start but as you find clues in the mysterious caves and crevices of the game scenery you learn a very deep and down right amazing story its also a open world survival game and without a doubt one of the scariest games ive played 10/10 would recommend
1447,Good

1455,"GOOD
"
1456,"Fun to wander about and knock the teeth out of the locals, but this is a [b]survival[/b] game first, and the crafting, base-building, and exploration elements are secondary. Don't expect to build a grand home in the wilderness within your first week. This is not a relaxing stroll in the woods.

Materials are scarce, and you'll have to spend many days clearing dozens of trees and transporting materials via sled in order to get a simple and defensible home base. And emphasis on [b]defensible[/b], because almost everything you do gradually attracts the attention of any nearby flesh-eating mutants. 

Like I said, it's a good bit of fun. But most of your time will be put into keeping yourself healthy and fed. And the more time you spend doing that, the harder it becomes, as more tribes and more horrid mutants try to claim your delicious, nutrient-laden flesh."

1470,"The Hog Rider card is unlocked from the Spell Valley (Arena 5). He is a quick building-targeting, melee troop with moderately high hitpoints and damage. He appears just like his Clash of Clans counterpart; a man with brown eyebrows, a beard, a mohawk, and a golden body piercing in his left ear who is riding a hog. A Hog Rider card costs 4 Elixir to deploy.

Strategy
When he is jumping over the river, he cannot be targeted by any ground attacking units. The Log and Earthquake will fail to damage a Hog Rider while he is jumping. Air troops can still attack him though, and the Inferno Tower and Inferno Dragon will continue to ramp up their damage.
When countering Hog Riders, obviously use buildings. But be wary as it the offender would usually play around it with cards such as Earthquake. Air swarms such as Minion Horde can help due to the Hog's usual support tools not countering them.
On the offender's side, a powerful move is to accompany him with an Earthquake, obilerating almost every building, and also grounded swarms. To a lesser extent, Lightning could also be used, retaining the same point of almost destroying every building while also crippling troops such as the Wizard or the Hunter.
The Log could also be an effective first play as a cycle, but it only kills swarms and sometimes a non-center-placed Tombstone.
The Hog Rider can be paired with the Lumberjack as both a swarm bait and damage combo. It is a very fast combo with an extremely high damage output potential, so the defender will likely try to counter it with a swarm. If this happens, the offender should use a spell like Arrows to render the defender poetically defenseless. If they manage to defeat the Lumberjack, the dropped Rage will make the Hog Rider even more dangerous than it normally is.
A fast and deadly combination is the Hog Rider and Mini P.E.K.K.A. combo. Both units are fast but the Mini P.E.K.K.A. does much more damage and does not attack only buildings so the Mini P.E.K.K.A. can deal with troops like the Executioner and Musketeer. However, this combo can be defeated with swarms like Skeleton Army, which will defeat both of them since neither of them can deal area damage. They are also unable to target air troops, so the Minion Horde can stop this easily.
A Hog Rider combined with a Goblin Barrel can be awkward for the opponent to defend against. Timing it so that the Hog Rider is tanking the tower shots for the Goblins is the most effective way to deal damage.
A Barbarian Barrel can shut this down with minimal Tower damage for a positive Elixir trade, as long as the Goblin Barrel was placed directly on the Tower. Use another card to counter the Hog Rider if it is necessary.
His fast move speed can boost forward mini tanks like an Ice Golem in a push. At the same time, he can also function as a tank for lower hitpoint troops such as Goblins as he still has a fair amount of health. However, the Hog Rider struggles with swarms, as they can damage him down and defeat him quickly while obstructing his path. Barbarians in particular can fully counter him without very strict timing on the defender's part, though they are vulnerable to spells. Swarm cards like Skeleton Army, Goblin Gang, and Minion Horde can also very easily counter him.
Use this to your advantage by placing a bulky swarm dealer in front of the Hog Rider (eg. Ice Golem, Valkyrie) so that the Hog Rider can transport it to the tower faster and also get protection from swarms.
Most cheap swarms complement the Hog Rider well, as they are nearly as fast as him and usually force more than one card out of the opponent's hand.
The Hog Rider in conjunction with the Freeze can surprise the opponent and allow the Hog Rider to deal much more damage than anticipated, especially if the opponent's go-to counter is a swarm, or swarms are their only effective counter to him. Skeletons and Bats will immediately be defeated by the spell, while Spear Goblins, Goblins, and Minions will be at low enough health to be defeated by a follow up small spell.
Against non-swarm troops, it can deal a lot of damage during the freeze time, but this can allow the opponent to set up a massive counterpush. For this reason, players should either only go for a Hog Rider + Freeze when they have other units backing it up from a counterattack, or if the match is about to end and they need to deal as much damage as possible. The exception to this is an Elixir Collector placed in front of the King's Tower. If a Hog Rider placed at the bridge, he can destroy the Collector for a positive Elixir trade, though the damage from both Princess Towers will usually mean he does not survive to deal any damage to them. However, if the opponent sends in defending troops, it can be an opportunity to gain spell damage value."

1497,"Probably hands down one of the best survival games I've ever played. Combat and enemy AI kinda sucks and is simplistic, but overall other mechanics and systems in game make up for it. I strongly recommend playing the game with friends. As well as if you have a VR headset, GIVE THE VR A TRY. It's not a half assed port to VR, and it's probably my favorite way to play."

story made me cry realy emotional"
1507,"One of the most unique games ive ever played. The enemy AI is adaptive and one of a kind. The story is present but not overwhelming or hard to follow. Theres elements that can give you a scare, but not so bad a non horror buff would be turned off from playing alone in the dark. the world is beautiful but runs well on an average computer. if you like anything related to survival or horror this game is a must."

1543,"The Forest is one of its kind game. It has one of the most interesting and well done AI i have ever seen in any other game. It has so much to offer when it comes to building, crafting and exploring.
Horror elements are really good in this game, especially inside the caves.
Story is not that good but also it is not that much important because all fun goes around building, interacting with your friends and defending your base againt non-stop cannibal attacks. I recommend this game.

1607,"Story Wise: Not your typical survival simulation type of game. This game is full of lore and plot twists. It's a dull chest full of treasure to discover. I love how well optimised the game is with such good graphics. Even with a low-spec computer, it is able to handle it very smoothly, which is surprising.

Gameplay: Well, I noticed there are some bugs or glitches that can make the player fly sometimes. From my first POV, it's kind of hard to figure out the game mechanics. The game is literally too dark, like very serious and makes no sense, even if it's in real life, it not that dark lol (This is only my complaint). The rest is really good and awesome as you play more and it becomes quite addictive to play with friends or others, ngl.

Overall: Awesome and can't wait to play the sequel!

I approached it with no expectations but within the first 10 minutes I was transported to a world I found difficult to break away from. The emotional impact of the sounds that unexpected visitors made - I will never forget. The ability to build bases became like a drug that took the edge off of the fearful reality that I was not alone here. Exploration was always rewarded and the unyielding need to survive that drove me again and again outside the ""safe"" confines of my base and in the forest produced emotions that I have never experienced in a game and memories of travel, fighting, desperation, looting, surprise, mystery and fear that I will never forget. The pacing was PERFECT. I have never played and finished a game that has left me, immediately, wanting to go back in the way the forest did. I can't believe I found and finished this game with Sons of the Forest dropping in a month or two. I cannot wait."

Some animals you need in order to complete the game don't spawn as much anymore though. Probably have played this way too much for my own good. Nonetheless, if you're thinking about it, just get it.

1634,Awesome game. Can't wait for Sons of the Forest. Play with a friend.
1635,"This survival game has interesting backstory / lore and kinda unique enemies. So we need different set of strategy and tactic to survive against them. It would be harder to survive and less fun as a solo player, and more enjoyable to gather resources and have adventure together with friends

Pro:
- Interesting lore
- Interesting game-play

Cons:
- The inventory system is kinda non-intuitive 
- The enemies could be really annoying

Final Score:
3/5"

But as a guy who likes building things, the building mechanisms aren't that useful. I'd like to see more structures that fit together with each other.

1725,"5/10 thought I was buying green hell but instead got a lite-survival game that lost its novelty real quick. I don't know how this game is so well received when in fact it's pretty mediocre to be honest. The depth of the game in terms of skill and challenge is not very deep, and once you figure it out, it gets pretty repetitive. The majority of the progression in this game is in exploring caves, which are all basically the same, just darkness with dead stuff and annoying ass fast cannibal guys who sometimes get stuck running infinitely into the walls and then teleporting everywhere. I don't feel like explaining how everything is just mediocre, but it just is. Killing animals is mediocre. Building stuff is mediocre. The items are also all pretty mediocre feeling. The game just feels really mediocre. How many more times can I say mediocre and is it actually enough mediocres to describe its mediocrity? 

Anyways don't buy this unless its like 5-10 bucks or smth cuz damn bro it's also just old and definitely not worth 20. Also if you get bored just watch the endings on youtube and you'll see how medicore the endings are. Anyways yeah. I still bought this game tho gddmnit."

My son got this game, so we installed it on his computer and he started playing. By the end of the week he had 18 hours on this game. This was horrible for me, as it was already hard for me to find ways to spend time with my son, as he is always out with his friends or just, watching YouTube. So i decided to make a Steam account and get this game to see if I could maybe play alongside him. loaded into the game, made my character and world and started playing but I was stuck on what you where supposed to do. I asked my Son for help and he hosted a game for me to join. loved it as it was the best time had spent with my Son since my wife had died. This game has ever since brought me and my son closer again and now we actually spend time together outside the house together as well. This game reminded me that there's fun to be had in everything, and it has brought both me and my Son many happy memories

1737,THIS GAME IS SO BUTTYLATTY DOWNYDOG BEN SUE JAKE JAMEN ZAZATASTIC
1738,this game has turned me into a cannibal 9.5 out of 10
1739,"When I got the survival fever, I tried many games from this genre and The Forest was still in early access, I had good memories and decided to play it again after its release from EA and eventually try the coop mode too. I have to say there are improvements but I had better memories, nonetheless it was still an enjoyable games with its pro. But nevermind my memories and let's check the best and worst features of this nice game.


[b][u]PROS[/u][/b]
[list]

[*][u]STORY[/u]: Usually I prefer survivals without a true story to make the game never-ending, I was surprised to acknowledge there's a game ending. Anyway the story is interesting, how we got into the forest and how we will eventually leave. The story could be expanded a lot more, but I appreciated the reasons behind the setting.

[*][u]GRAPHICS[/u]: Despite not so fresh, it has a decent graphics, perhaps not very well optimized at max details.

[*][u]COOP[/u]: I love coops in survival games! This one is decent and enjoyable, although it adds some bugs

[*][u]AI[/u]: Enemies have an interesting AI, they won't attack you straight, but study you instead: attack, retreat, react and interact with you and your constructions. Actually I enjoyed to study my enemies for minutes, until one of us would flee and ignore.

[*][u]MODES[/u]: Besides classic difficulties, there is a creative and pacifist mode, interesting to replay it in a different way.

[*][u]ACHIEVEMENTS[/u]: Achievements are good and possible, although a bit bugged. I had some fun hunting them but some were time consuming.

[/list]


[b][u]CONS[/u][/b]
[list]

[*][u]BUGS[/u]: Despite working decently, I encountered a generous amount of bugs, although I couldn't write them all down. The sledge can make you sky rocket in the air, creepy armore disappeared after loading a saved game a few times, interacting keys have wrong distance, sleep time was bugged and messed the day/night cycle, coop had quite some sync bugs too, some achievements are bugged and won't show up until a game restart, gooses look very bad and most of times lose their interaction once they are killed.

[*][u]ENEMY ATTACKS[/u]: You can easily encounter enemies while roaming, but after some time they will look for you and attack your base. That would be fine, if there weren't days I had to deal with their attacks everyday and play the game for two hours straight just to defend my base. When you finish the day with 15 corpses without sticking your nose outside your base, it becomes annoying, when it happens for more days in a row, it becomes frustrating, especially when playing with normal difficulty. Base attacks should be rebalanced, at least for single player.

[*][u]CAVES[/u]: This should be one of the most interesting features of the game: you must explore caves to advance the story and get some nice rewards and tools. Too bad Caves were so annoying, way too dark and mazy (even with a map), some very big. Whenever I had to explore one, I almost felt like playing anything else.

[*][u]CRYPTIC[/u]: You need to reach certain places and collect certain hidden objects to advance the story, if I didn't know the existence and the need for these, I don't think I could have done it in a blind run. I think some of them are way too hard to be found.

[*][u]REPETITIVE[/u]: Due to its setting, the game starts to get a bit repetitive too soon. Even with different biomes, you will feel like doing the same over and over, with no chances of changes.

[*][u]PRICE[/u]: Easily found with a very good discount, I think it's worth the money for a try!

[/list]

Final word: A very interesting survival that will glue you to the seat until you manage to find its bugs and repetitiveness, but if you like the genre, it won't let you down for giving it a chance. Recommended for its low price on discount and the positive experience after all."
1740,good game
1741,"good game but made me suicidal when i died

1742,very fun game to just hop in with your friends when your bored.

1746,BEST
1747,OK!
1748,funny axe go chop
1749,Very good game to play with your friends
1750,"I know this is an unpopular opinion, but what the hell...

I just get tired of games like this very easily, and the story gives you few to no pointers, so most games I would just end up screwing around until I got bored. This can also vary a lot depending on who you are playing with. Mostly I would just spend hours building something with a friend while chatting, and then a mutant would come along and destroy it all in a second.

This game certainly has its merits, and if it sounds like fun to you, go ahead and try it... but if you need a little bit more direction in a game's story, like me, then I can't really recommend this one at its full price."
1751,great game even better with friends
1752,"this game is really cool especially the part with canibals it's funny because i am one myself, i got along with them and they really liked me we are friends now.., wanna join our club? i dont mind but be careful don't taste good"

The plot, the game play and the endings perfect. 
Please add more animals in the next game sons of the forest like bears and lions and flamingos.
"
1761,good
1762,bro this game is fucking ass. For 3 days there was no rain. We ran out of water so that didnt help the fact that we bombarded by cannibals every 2 minutes and not only that the most common materials such as cloth was nearly impossible to find. How was this classed as normal difficulty?!!!
1763,Great survival game that you definitely shouldn't miss the chance to play
1764,"This game is brilliant to play with friends, I would recommend strongly.

Negative points: 
The way lighting works in this game i personally think is disgusting the ''flares'' are brighter than that from the ''flare gun'' that's only one example of being let down.

Enemy design variety isn't really there, to me it feels like they copy pasted the cannibals and just put a different colour body paint which honestly feels lazy.

Bow and arrows do not have cross-hair marker to show where your arrow is exactly, though its more realistic to not have one as this is a game i just feel there should be one for indications sake.

I personally have built a ground based cabin and a treehouse, on one very bad raid i lost everything on the ground yet my treehouse was untouched, if most enemies can climb trees and that one enemy can bulldoze everything why can't treehouses be invaded or ruined ?

My final negative is not having a female character though yes the story is based around a father losing his son but there are multiple ways to include a female choice such as, Having a similar layout as ''last of us 1'' did, having a female passenger survive and ''team up'' in the task of surviving with prompts to hunt for and comfort the male character, Having a female ''cannibal'' that has some human mentalities to which you can befriend over time through a small series of offerings. Even if there is only female 'no names' in multiplayer mode it would still be a step in the right direction.

Positives:

The fighting is amazing especially when you unlock the later game weapons, very well made animations.

The challenges the game presents are amazing, it doesn't matter if it's simply an enemy raid on your base, finding and completing caves or simple tasks as provisioning this game honestly has done the concept beautifully.

"
1765,"First of all I would like to say that I LOVE The Forest. It has everything a survival horror game needs! Everything this game has done is ALMOST perfect, there is a few flaws in my own opinion that I will get to soon but first I want to praise this game. The Forest has a lot of things you can do and will keep you busy for a good little while!

The Pros:
Collectables - Timmy's drawings, the flintlock pistol, cassette tapes, camcorder tapes and much much more!! 

The Combat system - As you play the forest you will come across ""Cannibals"", among other things, that will try and kill you. The way they fight is pretty unique to me for a game made in 2017. They can climb trees, leap at you and throw ""FIRE"" at you. All your character does is swing left and right with a weapon, sadly but its done really well.

The Crafting system - Almost everything you find in The Forest can be put to good use. From flowers, to make healing salves, to sicks and stones, to make tools and weapons. It has alot more items you can craft and it is pretty extensive.

Survival Horror - The ""light"" little jump scares going in and out of a cave from bats, the cannibals screaming and shouting in pitch black caves, the complete and utter feeling of loneliness when exploring (if your playing solo). 

Base Building - I like to take base building to the next level and overbuild and to have that in The Forest.... I loved it! You can build almost anywhere you want. 

Enemy Variety - The game has a decent amount of different enemies, ""Cannibals""/""Mutants"". This one is a bit hard for me to enjoy as they seem copy and pasted but with different ""Paints"" and ""weapons"". The mutants however are indeed unique.


The Cons - AKA The things I thought could have been done better:
The lack of building options - There is almost next to no diversity in build options. You can build a ""Custom"" house with ""Custom"" walls, floors and a roof - ok this might seem good but listen - after you build your floor and walls you want to make your roof, right? After you build it you realise that there are huge holes to be filled up. You have got to be REALLY creative to fill these by MESHING ""Custom walls"" E.T.C to fill them up. 

Flares/Flare gun/Lighting - The amount of light that the flare and flare gun gives you is VERY disappointing. Flares - Pitch black cave, lights a flare, next to NO light given. Flare gun - pitch black night, fires flare gun in sky, next to no light given. The lighter and flash light are much better than these. Very disappointed in the lighting of this.

Base destruction - This one is  strange to me. So the devs allow the cannibals to destroy your base, right. The cannibals can climb trees, right. The can destroy ""GROUND BASES"" but the cannot, and i mean this, CANNOT destroy a measly treehouse. What the hell...


TL;DR/Outcome:
All in all, The Forest is a great survival horror game that has definitely peaked. I would recommend this game to anyone that is wanting a solid survival horror experience, solo or multiplayer. I would rate it a solid 9/10. Would have been a 10/10 if it had just a little bit more of a better building system and actually had worked on the ""Flare gun"" and ""Flares""."
1766,for some reason i just couldnt get into this game :/ i felt it was kinda buggy and it ruined the experience for me. i gave it two tries and was just pretty bored - maybe ill pick it up someday again and my opinion will change
1767,fun w people but first person i find was a modder who spawned stuff in and kept dying
1768,AWESOME!!
1769,Playing with friends and this is fantastic. Playing solo and your sadistic but I respect that

1794,"I really like this game, only the lighting in the forest looks a bit unnatural sometimes. The game is also poorly optimized, so you have to spend a while in the settings (at least for me it was), but after that, you get a well-functioning, nice and, above all, enjoyable game"
1795,"Nah, just dont."
1796,SUPER GOOD
1797,"Absolutely amazing game! Huge credit to the team at Endnight for creating this masterpiece. From being free to do what you want exploring and creating, fighting and surviving like you would have to in real life, to the depth of the story that just shocks and excites you as you dive deeper. Amazing game solo, but even better with a friend. 10/10. Cannot wait for the sequel!"

1800,"What can I say, this game is a really excellent game, almost a masterpiece in my opinion. The Forest is a game that has all the essential principles of a really excellent game, a mysterious location, a simple undertaking becoming a much larger and more daunting task as it progresses, and a variety of things to do in the game.

The Forest is an open world survival horror and exploration game with prominent sandbox elements such as building. It opens up with you in a plane crash and your child being taken by some creepy red man. Retrieving your child is the primary objective, but as you continue through the game you begin to realize that it is more complicated than that, and that something big going on around this peninsula. You will spend the majority of the game learning about the world and building shelters and killing cannibals that roam the peninsula. 

The gameplay is simple but very fun and effective, building a house in the game can be done with virtually any way you want, you can use a prefab house or just lay a floor plan from scratch and build walls around it. Obtaining resources in the game is interesting, for most equipment items or pieces of furniture you need to hunt animals, there are different kinds of animals around the peninsula that you'll need to travel to find. The game has caves which are the main ways of obtaining special resources like soda, snacks, dynamite, etc. the caves respawn any special loot like this upon exit and re-entry, so you can grind, though it is usually not necessary or time-efficient.

The story of the Forest is presented in a very interesting way. In terms of direct story, there's very little, not much is really told to you outright until near the end of the game, however, the implied and greater story is much more in-depth. The story is out there on youtube, and i'd recommend watching some videos once you've completed the game because it is quite interesting.

Now for my issues:

The game is very janky, it is to be expected with an indie studio but it certainly is quite janky, especially in multiplayer. The animations are wonky and feel kind of machinelike, the cannibals are animated pretty well, though sometimes their movements seem too fast and hectic even for them. The combat is a little weak too, sometimes the combat can seem very unfair, and if you aren't prepared enough, your entire base can be completely torn apart in moments, especially early game. The cannibals have very little indication of how healthy they are, sometimes you'll knock them around for quite some time and they don't really seem to be changing in behavior until they suddenly just drop dead, whereas sometimes you'll get hit just a few times and be down immediately. However, these are the main complaints, almost everything else is workable and will certainly be improved up in the sequel.

This game is so much fun, especially in multiplayer and I am more hyped for Son of The Forest than I have been hyped for almost any game in the past several years. I would definitely recommend this to anyone who loves survival and sandbox games."
1801,"Survival game, it held a good story with different endings and opportunity to be super creative in building and crafting, the process of collecting stuff and crafting them is very clever and fun at the same time. Don't play it alone! It's more fun with friends.

If you're interested and happened to host an online server, make sure you're not putting any effort in it, it's so common that some strange toxic will join the server and blow all your work off with one bomb!!"
1802,"Typical survival game. Decent plot, fantastic co-op mode. Quite many in-game bugs, but nice production overall. 7/10"
1803,"Love this game honestly, cannot wait for sons of the forest next month <3"

1811,"Went in to this knowing nothing about it and played with a couple of friends, it's such a fun/terrifying game! It can be a little grindy when it comes to building but the fun factor surpasses that. Be prepared to scream and run away like a little girl"
1812,Love it
1813,Creative stuff.
1814,"After reading the overwhelmingly positive reviews for this game, my friend and I were extremely disappointed with the experience. The crafting was shallow and unnecessary for completing the main story, the combat boiled down to stun-locking enemies by spamming left-click, and the 'mystery' of the Forest was insipid and uninspired drivel."
1815,good game
1816,scary
1817,very good game!
1818,One of the best survival craft games out there. Fun solo or multiplayer and the VR implementation works decently most of the time. Scary as hell too when you're exploring the cave systems. Looking forward to Sons Of The Forest.
1819,pretty alright no cyap. once you get into the later game it becomes pretty dull but still overall alright
1820,CRACKA

1823,hehe funny little forest people
1824,Challenging and gives me chills. Good balance!
1825,Sometimes games connect you with a really core memory. I remember playing this through with one of my good friends during quarantine and having some of the best time gaming in a long while. It's so enticing and satisfying at the same time. I don't like horror games but this has some realistic thrill which keeps you on edge constantly in a way that I find so cool. The story is compelling and keeps you asking questions as you solve it and after. You can mess around and do dumb stuff and there's so much potential creativity. One of my favorite games :).
1826,can't see the penis
1827,"Oh well... I played it on single player and didn't finish the story because at some point (about 10 hours in) I felt like the game became a waste of time. Regardless, I continued for some more hours, hoping for the best. A corrupted save marked the end of it... 4/10.

The Forest is from about the same time as Subnautica, Green Hell, and The Long Dark and also has crafting and survival aspects. But in contrast to the other games, The Forest is very combat-heavy and wants to be a horror game. 
- Resource management (hunger, water) is only a minor aspect; 
- Items don't break due to usage
- Orientation is aided by a map featuring a live location marker (so you can't get lost);
- Sleep progresses time (if you sleep at the wrong time you end up awake at night with no visibility of your surroundings and have to wait until sunrise), you can skip sleeping altogether;
- The only resource you need to manage is your health. 
You will be (constantly) fighting a handful of enemy types in one of the numerous caves or above the ground.
While you can clear out the caves, there is an endless respawn of enemies above the ground. Enemy camps for taking out are absent. Which makes me wonder, where do they hatch?
As the combat is not rewarding and you can easily stun lock most of the enemies, this gets old fast, and encountering enemies becomes annoying. The only danger is becoming swarmed by multiple groups of enemies. You are a badass with many weapons and a pro in crafting stuff ;)

The crafting aspects (base building and equipment/items) are well done considering the age of the game.

Why no thumbs up? I expect some immersion; this one does not provide.
Here is why: 
The abundance of everything due to the constant respawn of consumables, crafting components, wildlife, and enemies breaks it for me. For example, when spearfishing in a tiny pond, fish can simply respawn at the exact same spot where you just pulled out a fish; same applies for game (deer, boars, squirrels, etc.); you can even hunt birds with your spear as many don't take off as you get close.
The game showers you with canned beverages and packaged food, so you hardly have to hunt for animals or craft a water skin. Maybe this is better balanced on a higher difficulty, but I can't bring myself to restart the game on hard.
More questionable design choices: you can craft warm clothing to prevent freezing once you go to the snow biome (~5% of the map). You can also go there without warm clothing, as freezing only drains your energy and gives no real penalty. To top it off, you have no incentive to venture into this area in the first place. It's completely pointless.
In caves, some sections can be accessed only after destroying a wooden wall, those walls apparently also respawn. 
Cannibals, although inhabiting the caves, cannot climb the numerous (and partially ridiculously long ropes) and easily get stuck on corners. So if you feel like it, you can safely kill them from a distance in many cases.
The story is basically non existant. Your journal gives you a to-do list with no explanation why. From time to time, you find some pictures that don't give any explanation either. Apart from a corrupted save, I did not encounter any major bugs.

1828,It's got the atmosphere of all your favourite horror flicks. Staggering around in dark caves avoiding what lurks in the shadows. This game actually gave me goosebumps.

1842,this game has to be one of the best survival games I have ever played and i cant wait for sons of the forest to come out
1843,"I thought it was not enjoyable because I was playing it on a high difficulty when I prefer hard games. Then I tried it on normal difficulty. Do not recommend because this game is not interesting for someone who pursued the game because it advertised some sort of story. This is a game centred on survival for the sake of survival, rather than some more interesting purpose of escaping the planet as in Subnautica. There is little direction in what you are supposed to do, which may be attractive for some, but when I am making my third trap while branching reasonably far from my camp without anything happening aside from encountering another lizard (on my new game apparently I had to build very specific shelters to unlock cannibals rather than my larger shelters and fires since I had experience) or finding myself dangling on the ceiling of some cave for the fifth time with the same cutscene, I understandably got bored. While I understand that the goal is to explore the caves, find Timmy, and perhaps learn of some mystery, there is little motivating me to do any of this. There is further little to the caves. While there are eventually body horrors, of which mine disappeared because I retreated for a short bit, a good game needs a hook early on with additional impetus to keep me moving forward. I don't need much because I enjoyed Subnautica, but the problem I had with this game is that it did not give me something interesting to keep me moving forward. It quickly became apparent that crafting was extremely limited in scope. The cannibals became just another obstacle. Survival mechanics became just another thing that could be done. Caves were just another reason to battle cannibals, except this time in the dark. While some may argue that the game gets better as you play it, I am not going to waste my time waiting for it to get good. I gave it another chance after initially writing this critical review, and while exploring the caves made it somewhat interesting again, there was no payoff after getting through my first one. I see no reason to continue it and would caution players looking for a game that makes the best use of their time."

1878,grafics feel like a 2016 game

1901,"One of the best games I've ever played, old but very nice graphics and a great storyline.Both the gameplay and the story keep you entertained during the game and give you things to do. The end was well made and I really enjoyed the game.
Multiplayer is also really fun."
1902,"Buen juego muy aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa
"
1903,Who TF is timmy?
1904,"Possibly one of the best survival games I have ever played. The story is great. The progression system where you go through caves to get new gear can be a bit confusing as you have to find or search up the order of the caves you have to go through in order to not get stuck next to a cliff that requires an item to go over. Also a bit buggy at times where you can randomly go flying into the sky, but that's a small price to pay for such a good game."

1942,"It's good, a little weird thematically. The game itself does behave a bit odd at times, not buggy, just the game elements are prominent. Its a game with an environment that invites immersion, but then something very game like will happen, and it pulls you out of that immersion. Overall though a good game."
1943,our house crumbled
1944,"I love this game. It is that perfect level of crafting, base building and survival.  Plus a story line with very little direction, which at first I thought was a bad thing. But having to really explore and put clues together made it that much better. Also side note, this isnt a game where there are waves and waves of enemies all the time. You can relax a bit more while building your bases and exploring. It has multiplayer that functions really well for this kind of game.  Go check out some youtube videos and see if its for you. (damn I sounded like I am getting paid for this. lmao)"

1950,it a fun  game that you and your friends can play and have fun
1951,"You could play it how you want but by far the most efficient way (that I found) was to never bother building a base, just do the caves and build a bed when and where needed.
Besides that though, the combat is terrible and the progression doesnt feel satisfying."
1952,Completely amazing.  Can't say anything bad about it at all for fans of survival and horror.
1953,gud shit
1954,cool game! but i can't get further into the game because i don't know what to do
1955,+
1956,"Yes, this game heavily fun and can be extremely difficult definitely not for the people who just want to sit back and relax not only is this game difficult and has cannibals chasing you it also has the mutant boss(s) they usually travel in pairs not only that whilst fighting them off and protecting you and your base whilst u try and find your son u have to keep up your hunger your health your stamina and your heat and your thirst this game is not for the people who want it easy this is all for now hopefully this is the last time i make this message bye bye :D"
1957,"TL;DR: It's mediocre. The forest tries to be both a horror-walking-sim and a survival-crafting game at the same time and fails at both. If you wanna buy it, read the entire review before you do.

The game looks like an open world crafting-survival game. And yes.. it has these elements. But to my surprise, i learned that they are all optional and don't progress the game in any way. If you wanna finish the game, there is no need to build a base, hunt animals or craft items. Turns out you spend most of your time walking through cave systems. Could be fun, right? Well it's not. The caves are so dark that you can hardly see where you're going (even WITH the lamp). They are designed badly, the engine is NOT suited to rendering light enclosed spaces and the occasional fights quickly become boring because the enemy AI is so dumb that they pose more of an annoyance than a challenge. Not that the sluggish and slow combat system would make fighting them fun anyway. You crawl your way through seven (!) huge cave systems, they all look the same, most of them take over an hour and all of them are soul crushingly boring. Their sole purpose is to have you find key items needed for the storyline. And if you miss one.. haha.. good luck going through ALL of it again to search for that sucker. You also find all your best items in the game in the caves. Why again can i craft items if all endgame gear is just lying on the ground? Nevermind..

Look.. it's not like exploring cave systems couldn't be fun in a game. But not if it's done like this. So you could just ignore the story and use this game only for the base building and crafting aspects, right? Well.. yeah.. but survival simply isn't a challenge. What about suriving against the cannibal raiders? Unfortunately they offer no challenge either. They just run against the walls of your base, occasionally fleeing and then running into your walls again. You know the zombies in minecraft? Yup. They have better pathing and better AI.

So is the forest any good? In my opinion.. no. If you want a good horror game you can just play Amnesia: The dark descent or Outlast. If you wanna craft and build.. get minecraft. Factorio. Satisfactory. Or any of the other games where survival and crafting isn't an optional feature but a the center focus of the game.

The Forest is one of these games that were doomed from the start because the entire concept of the game, the choice of engine and the games design simply do not align. It's a mix of different visions, ideas and features that do not form a coherent whole. And the resulting mess is fun.. but only for a dozen hours or so. Which isn't enough for this games pricetag imo."

1964,EZ
1965,"fun game, but they could've spent a little less money on the visuals and more on the gameplay. My friend and I beat the game on Hard Survival without actually realizing it because it was so easy! 8/10 needs better gameplay, hopefully the next game delivers."
1966,rogol spider
1967,Fun to play with your friends.
1968,"good game W
"
1969,"The A button on gamepad refuses to work in menus. I tried holding it. I tried other Steam Input controller layouts. Nothing.

I had to turn down left joystick sensitivity slightly. It was absurdly quick to the flick at first.

The shadows were glitchy and gross-looking even on Very High/Ultra/Max graphics settings at my display's native 16:9 1080p. The quality of many graphical assets makes this game look much older than it actually is.

Waiting, hunched over, motionless and emotionless, in the shadows, at night, for creatures and cannibals to go away--overall more boring than terrifying. I couldn't see a damn thing after the quick simple fire burned out.

Reminded me of my experience with Minecraft in that sense. Even after surviving a night or two, what is there to do?

I'll tell ya: refund."

1974,yes
1975,"its very hard to try and do a blind playthrough, but if you can last by just searching up the basics, it will enhance the game. i made the mistake of looking up too much and it really makes it less enjoyable. that doesn't matter though since i could last days just building bases."

2011,"Lots of fun with a group of friends. Not so easy to play solo, though. Plenty of options for how to build up your base and strategies to play with. I personally prefer to play with buildings as indestructible, and recommend this setting for anyone starting the game new so you have a chance to learn what you're doing and build up some skills before allowing big things to break everything you spent hours building. There's probably better ways to prevent that with building different traps etc, but I like that we have options to play in the way that suits our own enjoyment."

2017,goooood
2018,"This game is sweet, works well on the steam deck too"
2019,the game is a good survival game that has a realistic building system for my opinion u need to put the stuff in over time to finish the build also u don't need to follow the scary caves if u don't want to u have a option to build mostly anything u want to like a village and defend it against the monsters and survive as long as u can  so i give a 4.5 star rating
2020,Hunting big lizards and crocs is fun.  Really good game

2022,It's quite an interesting game.
2023,It's pretty good but gets boring pretty fast

there's about 3 buildings in the game along with various storage containers for rocks and wood of varying sizes. 
the crafting system relies on your ability to catch animals with a frankly bad melee combat system. 

There's no leveling to speak of. 
The survival aspect of the game looks shallow. a candy bar will basically refill your character's hungry meter entirely. 

I must be missing the point of this game cause it's just boring as fuck coming from valheim or 7 days to die."

2067,"It was a while back, but they broke birthday traps and other mechanics with an update and decided never to address it. It's an okay game, but base building is largely useless if you like making traps since they borked the ai. Works well enough with combat, but the most appealing aspect of the game for me was rendered completely broken. Nothing like putting in hours of work to watch the ai glitch through your traps or ""vault"" through two layers of birthday traps"

2115,"When I first got this game I didn't think it would have much and thought it was just a normal survival game but after playing it for a while IT is A LOT more than that like the amount of building options, many different enemies and it also has a massive play area, It doesn't look big on the above ground map but underground is completly different and apparently it goes so deep to the point where you need a rebreather to explore further! I would definetly recommened this game, I havent played on my own yet but I know with friends it is so much fun. For 5 dollars its 100% worth it and the fact only 4 guys made it is amazing!(I think 4 guys idk if thats true tho)"
2116,Naked people chased me
2117,"The Forest is a refreshing take on survival horror game genre. Unlike most horror survival games, The Forest manages to be legitimately terrifying whether it be due to the disgustingly realistic creature designs, the smart AI on the cannibals of the island that make you feel like you're always being watched, or the generally eerie tone of the story. Nothing in this game is quite as horrifying as realizing that the cannibals are just watching your every move, silently. While the story is lackluster until the end and the survival elements are an afterthought after the first couple of days, The Forest is a game that should be in everyone's steam library as its a game that is both great for single and multiplayer fun."
2118,"Amazing
"
2119,"its just good 
trust bro
"
2120,The game was never to find Timmy.
2121,"This a nice game to play with friends who want to have horror (thriller) vibes in a way. Decisions will be made whether to see if team work strategy will work.

You can play solo here. But it‚Äôs best to play with a friend or (your / you‚Äôre) group of friends as well remember you can play with 7 other players including ‚ÄôYou‚Äô thus making the count of 8 players total."

2137,this game is a 10/10 as long as you like survival/crafting games. The horror aspect makes it even better. yea there is a few bugs but nothing game breaking. The AI is great and always keeps you on your toes(don't underestimate them at all) 27 hours in and i still haven't got to the end of the story. it doesn't hold your hand at all and that's what makes it so good. every time you explore you always find something either new equipment or an item to do with the story. i would highly recommend this game

Literally a bug needs to be fixed. Hopefully this is fixed for future players so they wouldn't have to reset to their previous save as a solution as I did.

It kinda is baffling there's bugs like this still in the game despite this game out since 2018."
2151,"I made a severe and continuous lapse in my judgement, and I don‚Äôt expect to be forgiven. I‚Äôm simply here to apologise.
What we came across in the woods that day was obviously unplanned. The reactions you saw on tape were raw; they were unfiltered. None of us knew how to react or how to feel. I should have never posted the video. I should have put the cameras down and stopped recording what we were going through. There's a lot of things I should have done differently but I didn't. And for that, from the bottom of my heart, I am sorry. I want to apologise to the internet. I want to apologise to anyone who has seen the video. I want to apologise to anyone who has been affected or touched by mental illness, or depression, or suicide. But most importantly I want to apologise to the victim and his family. For my fans who are defending my actions, please don't. I don‚Äôt deserve to be defended. My goal with my content is always to entertain; to push the boundaries, to be all-inclusive. In the world live in, I share almost everything I do. The intent is never to be heartless, cruel, or malicious. Like I said I made a huge mistake. I don‚Äôt expect to be forgiven, I‚Äôm just here to apologise. I'm ashamed of myself. I‚Äôm disappointed in myself. And I promise to be better. I will be better. Thank you."

2156,It breaks friendships.
2157,     OKAY WELL lets start off by saying this is one of the best survival horror games i've every came by i played many before from xbox to pc and when i say that this game is amazing it really is ive never seen such a  perfect game and a good story line to tie it together perfectly like hello! It have great work done to this and im so excited that there is going to be a par two to this series cant wait 10/10 for me very positive but once i beat the game i did a little this and that but after a while got bored but during the story playthrough was amazing.
2158,SO MUCH FUN W FRIENDS WOULD RECOMMEND FOR ANY FRIEND GROUP WANTING TO GET A GAME
2159,i really enjoy this game it fun even when you play alone or with friends
2160,very fun!!1
2161,"See my review about The Long Dark. Loved this game till I beat it, mastered it, and learned it means nothing. Your son dies no matter what.Like life, no matter how perfect you play, you lose. The time you put in, the people you love. Doesn't matter. You lost. Before you even accepted the quest. The story was, yes, the journey, but you still lost before it was told. With that, that is why this game is good, because it is realistic in its depiction of inevitable loss. Unknowing loss. You were living on borrowed time loss. Every moment you enjoy, it's BITTERsweet. Just wait till you learn the truth. Play this if you are grieving.."

2170,"I really enjoy the openness of the game. I am able to play by myself and still have some fun. I do wish there were more achievements to earn on single player. It is kind of easy to run out of things to do after you beat the main boss so you have to keep yourself busy. But it can be either super chill or you can go exploring and run into cannibals, armsies, etc. Overall, I do enjoy playing this game. Would definitely recommend."
2171,"Of all of the ""four horsemen"" games on Steam (survival, multiplayer, crafting, early access), this one is my favorite. A very graceful escape from the prison that early access can be for some projects. Lots of content, cool mods online, stable multiplayer, robust building, and fun exploration. Scary, too! It still makes me jump sometimes! Great game solo or with buddies. Big recommend if you like this genre."

2187,"
The Forest is an open world survival horror video game developed and published by Endnight Games. The game takes place on a remote, heavily forested peninsula where the player character wakes up after a plane crash. The player is then left to survive in the wilderness, facing many dangers such as starvation, dehydration, hypothermia, wild animals, and cannibals. 

The Forest is an excellent survival horror game that offers a unique and harrowing experience. The game's open world design allows players to explore and survive in a variety of ways, and the many dangers present in the game provide a sense of tension and suspense. The game's graphics are stunning and the sound design is incredibly atmospheric, making The Forest a truly immersive experience. 

However, The Forest can be a bit challenging at times, and the player may need to put in a bit of extra effort to survive. Additionally, the game does not offer much in the way of guidance, so players may need to do some research outside of the game in order to progress. Overall, The Forest is a great survival horror game that offers a unique and challenging experience."
2188,Best survival game I‚Äôve played in a long time a real sense of urgency is created by the ever growing dangers around you the atmosphere is truly beautiful and terrifying with the change of lighting or sounds the game flip flops between beauty of the forest and the fear of loneliness great great game

2230,"Ultimately the game is unfortunately not recommended. Survival gameplay is pretty good, but otherwise it feels directionless. Yeah, ok, there's this son or whatever of the main character, who is missing, but with zero hints where to look, as a player I don't feel motivated at all to go and look for him. I could just set up the base on the island, where enemies can't get (they can't swim), with rabbit farm for food, rainwater collectors for water, and only occasionally move to land to collect some wood for fire and cooking. ""Subnautica"" felt way better in that regard, there's an early event, directing the player to where following the storyline starts, and they can go from there."
2231,nice game
2232,"If you're looking for a review on this game you've come to the wrong place, but if you're looking for an outstanding pie recipe you've come to the right place.

Ingredients:

1. 6 tablespoons unsalted butter
2. 1/2 cup white sugar
3. 1/2 cup brown sugar
4. 1/4 cup water
5. 1/4 teaspoon cinnamon
6. 1 pinch salt
7. 5 apples - peeled, cored and sliced
8. 1 pastry for double-crust pie

Directions:

1. Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C).
2. Combine butter, white sugar, brown sugar, water, cinnamon, and salt in a saucepan over medium heat. Bring to a boil, remove from heat and set aside.
3. Roll out half the pastry to fit a 9-inch pie plate. Place bottom crust in pie plate; pour in apple slices.
4. Roll out top crust into a 10-inch circle. Cut into 8 (1-inch) wide strips with a sharp paring knife or pastry wheel. Weave the pastry strips, one at a time, into a lattice pattern. Fold the ends of the lattice strips under the edge of the bottom crust and crimp to seal.
5. Pour butter-sugar mixture over top of pie, coating the lattice, and allowing any remaining sauce to drizzle through the crust.
6. Bake in the preheated oven for 15 minutes. Reduce heat to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C), and bake until the crust is golden brown, the caramel on the top crust is set, and the apple filling is bubbling, 35 to 40 more minutes. Allow to cool completely before slicing."

This game is overall extremely fun to play when you're bored of the other games you own, and with friends the feeling is amplified 10x. I highly recommend to buy this if you have the money."
2242,"AMAZING GRAPHIC, AMAZING STORY 9/10"
2243,Awesome game but what a major bummer that the host of a co-op game owns the save file and nobody can access it unless that person is on.  Got this game a few nights back with a buddy. We played for 4 hours and had a blast. The next night he tried to play with out me and the save file doesn't exist for him. We haven't been back since. It really sucks.  Hopefully they change this in the sequel because we are excited for it to come out

2258,"The game itself is fun and I really enjoy the randomness of the enemies and the story. However, the game feels like it is still in early access. I bought this game in 2022 and bugs back from 2018 don't seem to be fixed. There are many of them, which makes the game annoying at times. They are not visual bugs either, for example I keep getting launched into the air when using log sled and losing my health for no reason. Same thing happened to the person I was playing with. The log sleds also keep clipping through the floor, making them unusuable until you fill them up with logs again, which seems to fix the problem. Once I fell through the map when entering the caves and had to load from early save. The building mode is really, really annoying. I bought it on 50% sale and it is not worth the full price in my opinion."
2259,Fun game if you're into crafting.
2260,"Truly one of the most amazing games that I have played in a long time.
Sound effects and level of intensity is only second best to the original Subnautica... But not by far.

2299,"Recently, I discovered a game called The Forest. 
At first it seemed to be another boring horror game with some survival. But, as time on game went by, it started to look better and better. After 10 hours in game, I'm still discovering new features in game. Firstly, I thought that I will just have to finish the game after 1 hour because of boredom, but as time goes by, I was realizing how much I was wrong. This game is so extended and big, that I won't discover everything in the next 200 hours. 
I really like this game because of the realistic parts in it and also I love building things in survival with some scary things. I won't tell anything more, just jump into the game and have fun!"

2303,"The UI needs a full rework. Even the way you set your hotkeys is the most convoluted thing you will find in gaming. Add to that how the sensitivity is way too high even at 0 and the way you fix that is with some dll edits with a 3rd party program. Hopefully the next game will recognize these and other UI/UX/QOL shortcomings, because currently this game fails at a number of basic things and just makes it tedious to get anything done."

Apparently this game is only fun when u play with your friends because u can build, explore, survive the forest with your teammates or friend. The game can be boring after playing for a long time but its really fun when u come back once 1 month to the game. Game can be horror sometimes well to myself it is scary exploring at night and the caves.
Definitely recommended to people who play open world and survival
"
2315,"vedy gud yes
"
2316,"its good
"
2317,very fun and lots of jumpscare
2318,"You play as a survivor of a plane crash, who just saw your son being taken away by some strange man painted in red. You soon find out that you are stranded in an island, that there are canibals, and that you can build a gazebo, because, priorities.

The game doesn't ""tell"" you the plotline, they provide some hints instead, which I found really refreshing. The fanbase connected the dots however, and the ""clear"" story can be found online. You wont get any objective besides ""Find Timmy"", your son, but you start getting new TODOs as you keep exploring the island.

The horror elements are GREAT! I got liters of adrenaline from canibals SCREAMING and chasing me when I least expected. The fighting is kinda one-dimensional but I think this is good - this is NOT an action game and most of the time you're grossly outnumbered. The survival aspect is good: you have to eat, drink and can get sick/poisoned.

Sadly, it is almost impossible to build something straight, everything gets skewed. Also most of blueprints are nothing but decoration - I wish they had some kind of purpose instead. I also wish I could do more with the herbs.

Achievements are great (except ""Dont Save the Forest"") but can get glitched. No Linux port but worked flawlessly with Proton - thanks Valve!"
2319,its a game
2320,Controls are just bad. Will waste your time building and destroying what you built because of unintentional bashing around the objects. I'm gone !!! Goodbye and what a waste of time and money !!!
2321,its very hard to start but eventually you'll get it
2322,ok when i said i wanted to go to an island where hot naked men tried to eat my meat i didn't mean it in such a literal sense
2323,ngl i saw i was interested in this game for a while and now getting to play it is a a great thing that happened. even though i already did both of the endings i still love playing it.

As it's pretty easy to kill the everything in the game once you start making tools. I do wish they made the story a little bit longer but for what they give you. It's for sure worth the price."

2421,"I am reviewing my single player experience. There's a good reason this game gets very good ratings. You cannot really say anything against this very well constructed and original game. I have never played a game that feels like this one, it captures the castaway vibe to phenomenal effect. You will be taken on a gritty, maddening adventure/exploration (depending how you play I guess). The graphics are overall nice. Now for the criticism: this game is a grind and can be frustrating. The objectives are quite unclear and you better hope you have a good working memory (or access to some kind of online guide if you want to have your life back). While this actually plays in favour of the game, I am just writing this as a warning. Another thing is that the game does not seem very well optimised at times. I initially had to switch to low settings and then to medium. The game is quirky, dark (to say the least) and grotesque if you actually try to finish it. That said, you can just play it sandbox style and avoid most of the traumatising exploration I guess. I finished the game with a bit of rushing in 26 hours. The ending was fairly dissatisfying for me. Happy to finally uninstall. The enemies are quite difficult on normal, especially if you are not well prepared. 8/10."
2422,Good but the multiplayer system is really annoying if you aren't the host. Having to start on the plane every fucking time with a new character just gets old as shit after a while because your host friend gets really strong and has to protect you every five minutes while you start over with wimpy base stats and have to hide from fucking everything.
2423,gud game
2424,great cooking sim
2425,Fun
2426,Loved it when It came out and redownloaded it. Still Great.
2427,"Horror / Survival game. UI's a little clunky, there are some bugs/glitches, and it doesn't hold your hand at all, but once you get into it, it's quite nice. There's a lot you can do, whether that's mass slaughtering cannibals for your bone farm, or simply taking in the sites of the peninsula, And of course, eventually you should try to find your son...maybe after I build that wood-framed roller coaster."

2444,"Low QoL survival game, requires high time investment or watching guides to progress as the game will not hold your hand on this picnic trip to the local park.
Low vertical freedom of movement = no climbing any cliff or wall you run into, other than some specific walls with a tool in late game.
Average building system, no height adjustment by scrolling or grids to snap to, only cursor guided and rotated.
Inventory UI is something you will likely only see in this game alone, i'd prefer that as its novelty wore off after a while.

Dont jump in if you have been spoiled by other sandbox survival/building games, due respect to those who are willing to trudge the grind to prosper in the forest."

2459,"Where Valheim takes classic open world survivals like minecraft, and adds a hint of hidden story, The Forest takes the next step giving the player a push towards a story. Its still open world, albeit not to the scale of the previous games mentioned, with an interesting and fresh take on crafting. The beauty is in the discovery of what has happened to you, the island, and its other inhabitants. I thought this was going to be a horror game, and it is not, which is good. It is still however stealth fueled as combat can be overwhelming both by number and difficulty of enemies. I cant wait for the sequel."

2490,"This game is very fun. A horror survival game with a vague story. The game is fun to play with progressive difficulty and has scratched the itch I had for ages. Personally, I extremely enjoy this game and is now one of my favorite games. I bought it on special, but if I knew it would be this good I'd gladly pay any amount of money"
2491,i keep screaming at the naked female cannibals jumping at me. i look behind me and all i see is very dirty boobs
2492,"Game is a hot mess and I don't understand where all of these positive reviews are coming from. I bought this game on sale to be a fun game to play with my partners after work and it's not worth the 15$ (5$ each) I paid for all of us.

This game was made in 2014 and is extremely buggy and poorly optimized. Even on the lowest of settings it makes my higher end computer burn hot and this is coming from someone who plays a lot of high optimization survival games like Ark and Conan Exiles with no issues.

When you start the game you start with being on a plane that suddenly crashes in ""The Forest."" The game right off the bat doesn't do a good job at explaining your goals. You begin with a survival guide with a todo list that is glitched and doesn't always tick off your progress. (I cannot tell you how many times I made almost every type of shelter and couldn't get ""set up camp"" to tick off. Despite looking up on the Wiki what type of buildings I needed to build.) At the bottom of your screen you'll get notices saying your todo list has been updated with new goals, just for the guide to show blank when you open it. On normal difficulty it only takes two days before enemies will swarm your camp to the point of being annoying and besides ""finding Timmy"" (or just finding something else to do once you've set up) there isn't any reasons to leave the base you've built.

Your hunger and thirst go down rapidly and the stamina limiter is very harsh. Saving is only reserved for the host of the game and if they lose connection, several hours of progress can be wasted and the last time I played, I had it force me to start a new character when rejoining because the save file glitched.

I don't recommend this game and I would refund it if I could but instead I'm just going to remove it from my account."

2560,Fun survival game
2561,"it is a very family friendly game not scary , especially the topless cannibles,"
2562,"Started playing it in the early access days, it was good, a bit buggy and things missing - but hey it's early access what did i expect? 
Playing it after it fully came out, and after a few updates, i found many things added and everything polished. Still a few bugs tho. 
The game is good at getting you to want to keep exploring, and with the monster raids and night getting bigger and bigger you also get the sense of urgency to build more, expand, explore and get on with the story. 

The story is the only place this falls a bit flat for me. The story is there, but unless you go to specific caves and find the right parts of the story you wont know whats going on. I believe the story is good, i just didn't get subjected properly to it imo."
2563,Good Game. It's better to play with your friends Enjoy.

I started it up, ran for 1 minute, met the enemies, then 2 hours of seeing nothing but trees. its impossible to get water, building takes ages, storyline doesn't tell you what to do, just mindless walking with randomly spawned enemies and some half broken tents.

Then the bosses came.. as i ran through the dense woods screaming like a pre-pubescent child, i finally make it to the water, narrowly escaping the clutches of a solid lard beefcake. this meant war... I throw everything i have at this beast, much to no avail. My hands shaking as it seethes with rage to the fact that it cannot reach me in the shallows of the water, i laugh triumphantly but it is soon cut short by the impeding night.. as i tremble coldly with three sticks and a piece of my childs' toy i slowly die to the cold processes of the stormy seas, on looked by three generations of naked incest people huddling alongside a spherical flesh sack.

2656,10/10 can hit a fetus
2657,"I had a wonderful OBZH teacher at school. He taught me how to determine the side of the world by the moss on the trees, how to make a dwelling when there is an impenetrable thicket around; how to find food for myself... I managed to put something into practice, once getting lost with a full body of mushrooms in the forest.

But many years later, after playing alpha The Forest, I realized ‚Äî it's all wrong.


Lesson #1: Don't leave things unattended
You are not alone. Even in outer space, you are not alone ‚Äî let alone a huge island. It is worth going a little deeper into the thicket, and there will be crowds of rabbits and lizards around you. They crawl up trees and get in the way. They step into snares and traps, go under the axe themselves and even climb into the fire of your campfire. But don't let them fool you! It is worth gaping, and your life will hang by a thread: here you have thrown a raw carcass on the fire, but it has already been dragged away by an evil animal ‚Äî to eat or, what the hell is not joking, to bury. In any case, lunch can't be returned. That's an extra half minute of cooking!

Lesson #2: Finish what you started faster
The cruel world of The Forest knows no half measures. Do you want to light a fire, build a hut or set a trap? Climb into the survival guide, choose the desired item ‚Äî and first of all put its layout. Then you will carry everything you need to him.
And it's very convenient. However, no matter how many boards you insert into the fence ‚Äî until it is assembled, it does not exist. Even through the inserted boards, you can safely pass, which the owners of the island will be happy to take advantage of.

Lesson #3: Beware of the locals, they don't like you
They really do. But not in its raw form ‚Äî which automatically leads to conflict. Cannibals are the main and at the moment almost the only problem in The Forest. Do you want them not to find you? You can hide in some miniature cave, swim away to a broken yacht or wall yourself up in four walls. Otherwise, you will have to meet guests.
Local people walk in small groups of three or four individuals. But the longer you sit in one place, the more often you will be visited. Don't be surprised if you see about twelve hungry savages in one frame, say, in the dead of night. If you manage to survive such an invasion, then the whole coast will be littered with bodies ‚Äî but do not think that this will scare the others away.

Lesson #4: take advantage of the stupidity of the enemy
A long stay on the island leaves an imprint on a person. Firstly, the island people are short-sighted. Their eyesight is so unimportant that they will only see you at point blank range during the day. And the hearing is so lousy that they can pass by while you are chopping down a thick tree.
Perhaps the excess of human flesh in the diet is to blame. However, a healthy lifestyle makes cannibals incredibly tenacious. A blow to the head with an axe is not an argument for them ‚Äî it will take a long and tedious beating. And at any moment, the bully can run away and disappear into the forest thicket. Catching up with the scoundrel is not easy. And the devil knows if he'll come back or not! Most likely, he will return. It is possible that even with friends.
The intelligence of the local population is generally ambiguous. Having received a butt on the forehead, they keep their distance, try to come to your rear, wait for a convenient moment. At the same time, the psyche of cannibals leaves much to be desired. Like the little children from Lord of the Flies, savages put their heads on spikes everywhere, and in battle they can get carried away and run straight into a burning fire. They also like to rest their heads against the fence ‚Äî it looks especially pitiful when a naked man tries to escape. It beats against the wall like a moth against a window pane.

Lesson #5: Don't eat everything
Rabbits with lizards are, of course, nutritious. Chocolate bars and other junk food from chests that fell from the sky, too. They take up space in the stomach and restore energy (drinks do not clog the stomach). Good food can also replenish health, and reptile skins go to clothes and give additional protection from savage axes. There are mushrooms and berries in the game, both useful and poisonous. It is not difficult to distinguish one from the other ‚Äî ""bad"" berries will clog the stomach, but they will take away health. And the hero unequivocally groans.

And something can not be eaten in principle. The hero will not dare to shove raw meat into his mouth. Corpses of birds, sharks and turtles should not be touched at all. But most of all questions are caused by the mortal bodies of people. Completely inedible. Why? It's not entirely clear. They look very appetizing!

Lesson #6: Don't be too afraid of hunger
You can not keep crumbs in your mouth for at least two weeks ‚Äî and you will survive everything. Well, yes, you can't wave an axe on an empty stomach, and you can't escape or fight off cannibals. But you are not in danger of starvation. Perhaps the fresh sea air is so useful that it can feed and, most importantly, give the newly‚Äîborn Robinson Crusoe a drink. After all, water is not needed here at all. It would seem that the main concern of the islander is to arrange the supply of fresh, otherwise hello, dehydration! But no, it's all nonsense, we have enough rabbits with berries.

Lesson #7: Don't be afraid to die
If you stumble, get burned or take second place in a duel with a savage, life will not end there. Wherever you die, they will find you and drag you to the nearest cave, and there are a lot of them on the island. Why ‚Äî history is silent. But you can get out of the cave and run away wherever you look. However, the second time the number will not pass ‚Äî ""you survived N days""."

2690,"Some good and bad points about this game. 
The Good - It's atmospheric, the base designs near the end are good, the storyline isn't bad, game play is pretty good.

The Bad - There's no sort of tutorial or easing your way into the game, you crash, you're in the forest and you're on your own. Weapons are few and far between, enemies take too may hits to die, I hit someone with an axe and I expect that to be it. Constantly hungry or thirsty. timing is off, doesn't take long for it to get dark , had to playthrough using cheats just to progress. Overall, a waste of time and money"

The peaceful option is ok but that means no enemies whatsoever on the surface and I would have to start a new game and build and find everything all over again.

2708,"I am a 45 yo father, probably one of the oldest people playing this game. I am a single farther to my Son, who is 14 now. My son got this game for Christmas in 2021 from his uncle, so we installed it on his computer and he started playing. By the end of the week he had 24 hours on this game. This was horrible for me, as it was already hard for me to find ways to spend time with my son, as he is always out with his friends or just watching YouTube. So I decided to make a Steam account and get this game to see if I could maybe play alongside him. I loaded into the game, picked my character and started playing but I was stuck on what you where supposed to do. I asked my Son for help and he hosted a game for me to join. I loved it as it was the best time I had spent with my Son since my wife had died. This game has ever since brought me and my son closer again and now we actually spend time together outside the house together as well. This game reminded me that there's fun to be had in everything, and it has brought both me and my Son many happy memories.

2777,"The forest desktop is extremely fun, and I love playing it with my friends, it can be buggy at times as there are a lot of glitches, but most of them are fixable, funny, or useful. But this review is going to be about the forest VR.
When I first tried the forest in vr, i did not like it that much (i have been spoiled by top tier VR games like HLA, boneworks, TWDSS so i was used to a lot of other things). I could not figure out how to turn on smooth turn and it got boring kind of quickly. (I was playing alone too, and i was very new to the forest as a whole). I ended up figuring out how to do smooth turn (set the snap turn thing to 0). But after I tried playing it with a bunch of my friends who recently got the forest (they only do desktop I am the only one with a VR headset) i decided to try to play it in VR with them. It is actually super fun to play when you are playing with friends and focusing on other things that what might be wrong with the game. One plus is that the flashlight is actually GOOD when in VR. Also you can cut trees and enemies super fast without stamina use. For a game that was not built for VR, it actually has amazing VR support. Anyways thats my review for the forest VR"

2781,BOOBIE CANNIBAL GO HARD
2782,Truly a masterpiece of a horror survival game. The games exploration and atmosphere in the dense woods and claustrophobic caves are just the most greatest experience ever. It truly feels like danger with either all the darkness in the cave or with the dense forest and screaming of enemies. The enemies designes are truly horrific and just ugly that they give you chills just by looking at them. The unholy mess of flesh on the is truly something from a flesh nightmare. The Survival mechanic's are also great with some good crafting and building. The story was good for a survival game with all the mysteries.¬¥I cant wait for the second game where i can fight those fleshy abominations with a 12g shotgun while exploring a new atmosphere full world in the Sons Of The Forest.
2783,"The game is slightly unpolished, but an overall solid experience.  You feel stronger as you progress. The survival elements seem well balanced. The story arc while vague does reach a satisfying conclusion while leaving it open to the sequel to delve further into the lore.  The game does feel like some elements were cut from the final product. But that's inconsequential as the rest of the content is packaged well."

2804,"I picked this gem up for 5 bucks on a steam sale. What a great game at that price point. Plus its worth investing time in, because its actually pretty good. Decent crafting with excellent exploration and survival. Excellent graphics and sound, my my the sounds the things make is actually hair raising in the dark. If you get caught out in the forest in the dark, holy crap, what an experience! Sheer terror for little ones! If your older like me, it still gave me goose bumps! Literally, its the sounds the things make. Its terrifying to a degree I thought wasn't possible to achieve in a video game, even at my age. I cant imagine a child playing this. Way to bring terror back peeps! High five!"

2815,asu
2816,"it gud

2817,"Very easy game to learn and the UI is very user friendly. Crafting is simple, with potential recipes shown upon hovering over the cog if combining items. The difficulty is fair on normal and if you just want a survival game set in the forest without giant horrifying freaky mutants trying to bite your toes off while you shit behind a tree, there is a peaceful mode. Overall, very polished and enjoyable game, and the only change I would make would be allowing the player to flip the log sled back over when it gets stuck somewhere. 9.5/10, totally worth the price."
2818,multiplayer is terrible nothing saves even after you save the game and its so laggy
2819,epic game really light no jumscares or violence
2820,ye its pretty good
2821,Fun game for the whole family
2822,balls.
2823,I thought we were meant to be the cannibals
2824,"[b] The Forest: The most helpful review [/b]

[h1] GAMEPLAY [/h1]
the gameplay in the forest is actually quite scary and fun. the best part is not even the exploring part but the building part. 
i really appreciate the game for not giving you a compass and a map right away; this makes you use marks to identify your direction such as the sun and moon or the north mountain. caves are pretty scary and dark and the cannibals seem to be coming from no where. despite all of these positive points, there are lots of bugs and exploits such as building your base next to the plane to get infinite food every time you log in to your save. 8/10 gameplay

[h1] COMBAT [/h1]
this is arguably the worst thing about this game. the cannibals are literally the reincarnation of the hulk, they die for a shit-ton of swings. also the cannibals literally doge almost every swing. this game is supposed to be realistic but this is not realistic because how on earth did they learn to do that? actually, the one realistic thing about combat is how the layer violently swings the ax because they have not been trained for combat. 6/10 combat

[h1] Graphics [/h1]
there is not much to say about the graphics so this segment is going to be quick. the graphics hold pretty well today despite the game launching back 2014. graphics: 7/10

[h1] Verdict [/h1]
The game is really well made and i definitely recommend this game especially when it's on sale. The game is way more fun in multiplayer and absolutely less scary. i didn't mention the story but it's not bad especially for a survival game. i don't think the game deserves an overwhelmingly positive reviews(no hate tho) verdict: 8.5/10"
2825,"Still haven't beaten this one, but so far I like the mix of exploration, survival and being deeply unsettled by what I find. Would've been nice if the tooltip for the ""upgraded stick"" said ""you can use this as a torch"" because I refused to go into any caves because I couldn't see in the dark.

Of course, given what I found IN the caves, I kinda think that maybe staying out might not have been a bad idea."
2826,definitely recommend for those who wants to play survival game with friends. Not recommend for single player cause the content quit boring for single player
2827,very good
2828,this game bussin
2829,good
2830,"Very nice, excited for the second one"
2831,"This game is more than worth the money. There is a lot to explore, build, and fight in this game. The enemies will keep you on the edge of your seat as you navigate the land and especially when you enter the caves. There is a bit of learning curve when it comes to crafting, but the game helps out in this area when you mouse over the cog wheel (it will show you what you can craft with the item and what other items are needed to craft it). Overall, I would highly recommend buying and playing this game!"
2832,deforestation with dynamite
2833,its fun
2834,I love getting chased by retarded bald motherfucking cancer patiences.
2835,Good for coop
2836,"good game
"
2837,scary naked woman chasing me
2838,gud game
2839,A good game I would live in it
2840,"The game has almost limitless replayability. You can play it in so many unique ways. The story can be bland at times because it's easy to gloss over, but other than that I'd say this was is one of my favorite games. I personally have played it at least ten times over. I recently moved over to PC so this was one of the first games I got. Overall 10/10 game."
2841,"This game is a true masterpiece that achieved stuff not even AAA studios come close to. Playing this with a friend/friends is incredibly fun and also relaxing, but can also be extremely terrifying and intense especially in the caves.
The building system is probably the best building system ive ever seen in a game.
10/10 would highly recommend"
2842,great game cant wait for the next one
2843,wwwwgg
2844,Very fun game. I enjoyed playing this with my wife and kids together. It's a bit buggy and unpolished but more in a comical skyrim kind of way than a game breaking sort  of way.
2845,CANNIBAL ROLEPLAY UH UH UH UH
2846,"all good
"
2847,"It can get difficult at times, but that stems from the cannibals always hunting you sometimes before you even get back to base"
2848,mmmmmmmmmmnice

Realized we still didn't have enough logs to finish our base and getting more would take days of grinding. 
Duped logs and other resources and started actually having fun."

2900,n
2901,Yes yes yes such a good game it dose not have much content but when you beat it it is so rewarding. it is a bit steep though but on sale definitely pick it up.
2902,this game is amazing with friends 10/10
2903,Insaing play to the end this game is crazy.
2904,"do u want minecraft but cant afford it?

2905,got hypothermia and got killed by a massive naked baby 10/10 would recommend

2910,its really fun
2911,joke boss fight
2912,I can RP Patrick Bateman finally
2913,"i tried to get into this game so bad but just cant do it because its that horrible... firstly the building mechanic in this game is fin moronic and horrible there are so many other games that have such a much better build mechanic... even valahala or how ever you spell the name, is much much better and even that build system has flaws...

the amount of mats needed to build one fence is tedious and boring... 10 hits to break a tree, you require 5+ logs and can only carry 2 at a time and for you to completely surround yourself or the plane it takes 81 logs... 

this game has been out forever and these stupid flaws in this game still exist, i havent tried this as a multiplayer but solo 100% sucks so bad because of these dumb things...

will try it again much later in the future but for now this game sucks a$$"
2914,"its good thats all

2915,Im not really Good at this game but it's very nice and I want to finish it

2925,"I went into a forest and i was not attacked by naked people 
1/10 not a TRUE forest"
2926,yes good finish it
2927,This game taught me how to avoid cannibals.
2928,cool
2929,"to be honest, even on the easiest mode it was pretty difficult since the cannibals just didn't ever leave you alone. played it with my friend for two days and we ended up refunding it because it just was not fun to play. you pretty much just build stuff and fight off cannibals. i think there's a story line with your son, but its not very prominent. 
for what its worth the graphics are nice, and i could just be really bad at the game lol i would maybe watch a few playthroughs before committing to the game."

2946,"It's a nice open world game about survival. You really don't have a clear objective until you explore a bit, however this does mean you can take the game at your own pace and you can enjoy it however you want. You aren't forced to play by any standards. Overall the game (IN MY OPINION) is a 8/10."

2971,"So i've waited for a while to decide on if i ever wanted to write a review on this game, let alone a game in general.   So i guess here it goes!   

I really enjoyed this game and that says something since i'm not normally found playing survival games, i suck at most of them Cause you know, i can't survive real life so how can i survive a survival game?  Haha, jokes.   But really this game it litty like titties."
2972,Best survival game in my opinion! 10/10
2973,"ITS pretty anoyying getting atack every five seconds
"
2974,"h1] Exciting and thrilling but full of bugs [/h1]

I got this game in 2022 when it's in full release without any further Dev support. They are working on a sequel which is exciting but disappointing as this game is filled with some glaring bugs I feel should have been addressed before starting a new project.

That said I picked this up on sale for $5 bucks and for that kind of money it's a lot of fun, it's not a hardcore survival game but survival enough with horror that makes it fun and exciting especially with friends.

I'd definitely recommend picking it up if on sale."

2990,"I am not a fan of horror games but I definitely recommend The Forest. The game can be a bit intimidating and scary in the beginning, but as soon as you get used to it, it is very enjoyable. After playing it and going through the story, I can say that it deserves the overwhelmingly positive reviews. The story is well written and developed as if you are watching a movie. The game is well optimized for an open world game, and the gameplay is quite enjoyable if you are looking for survival or building or just the story. 10/10."

3040,"I have fairly mixed feelings on this game. 60% good - 40% Not so good.

On the one hand, I really enjoyed  the survival gameplay and gathering of materials/resources. However the building system with structures could be a bit more polished. It's not bad, just a bit tedious with wall/building placements. I also think think the tool/item crafting menu needs to be a bit more organized and streamlined. It can be a bit overwhelming trying to figure out what combines with what. I also find favoriting an item to the 1-4 keys should be as simple as selecting the item and hitting ""favorite"". It's just a bit dumb with how you need to combine it with your backpack in the crafting menu. It really just comes down to a lot of unnecessary clicking.

Another thing this game does great though is its atmosphere. The dark and oppressive night cycle combined with the claustrophobic caves and murderous cannibals really sells that you're trapped with death clawing at you every chance it can. 

Overall, this game has a really solid foundation and premise that I think just needs to be ironed out a bit more for me to truly enjoy its full potential. the atmosphere and gathering of resources is a winning combination, but the lackluster inventory management and awkward building keep me from wanting to go on with the game. That being said, this game clearly has a strong following based on Steam reviews alone, so maybe my critiques aren't relevant. But this has just been my experience with the game and I figured any feedback would be helpful. I'm still going to recommend it to people, though. A game doesn't have to be perfect for it to be just fun enough."

3116,"I am a 44 yo father, probably one of the oldest people playing this game. I am a single farther to my Son, who is 12 now. My son got this game for Christmas from his uncle, so we installed it on his computer and he started playing. By the end of the week he had 24 hours on this game. This was horrible for me, as it was already hard for me to find ways to spend time with my son, as he is always out with his friends or just, watching YouTube. So i decided to make a Steam account and get this game to see if I could maybe play alongside him. loaded into the game, made my character and world and started playing but I was stuck on what you where supposed to do. I asked my Son for help and he hosted a game for me to join. loved it as it was the best time had spent with my Son since my wife had died.

3117,"I am a 45 yo father, probably one of the oldest people playing this game. I am a single farther to my Son, who is 14 now. My son got this game for Christmas from his uncle, so we installed it on his computer and he started playing. By the end of the week he had 24 hours on this game. This was horrible for me, as it was already hard for me to find ways to spend time with my son, as he is always out with his friends or just, watching YouTube. So i decided to make a Steam account and get this game to see if I could maybe play alongside him. loaded into the game, made my character and world and started playing but I was stuck on what you where supposed to do. I asked my Son for help and he hosted a game for me to join. loved it as it was the best time had spent with my Son since my wife had died. This game has ever since brought me and my son closer again and now we actually spend time together outside the house together as well. This game reminded me that there's fun to be had in everything, and it has brought both me and my Son many happy memories."

3143,"I bought this on a whim because it was on sale and was pleasantly surprised.  This game does an excellent job of balancing a versatile building mechanic with the very real threat of starvation, freezing, dehydration, drowning, and mutated cannibalistic cultists around every corner with a mysterious story to piece together.  Highly recommend you skip the walk-throughs, play this one for yourself."

3153,"I am a 52 year old father, probably one of the oldest people playing. I am a single father to my son, who is now 14. My son recently started playing and in less than a week, he had already played for over 20 hours. This was terrible for me because it was already hard enough for me to spend time with my son, as he is always out with his friends or just watching videos on Youtube. So I decided to make a Steam account and get this game to see if I could maybe play alongside him. I loaded into the game and started playing but I was stuck on what you where supposed to do. I asked my son for help, and together we spent hours playing . I loved it as it was the best time I had spent with my son since my wife had died. Steam has ever since brought me and my son closer again, and now we actually spend time together outside the house as well. reminded me that there's fun to be had in everything, and it has brought both my son and I many happy memories.

3173,"I've played a lot of survival crafting games. What can i say... On the highest graphics settings The Forest looks so ugly, that you might have suicidal thoughts, despite yours in-game Sanity level is still at max. Sound design is dumb, and AI is straight from the 8-bit era: enemies move primarily in one direction. There are a lot of unnecessary crafting and building which barely gives any advantage in the game...

Well, written above is some sort of being true, unless you you made it to the first cave in the game. After that you life would change forever. You will be haunted by the nightmares of unspeakable horrors of the Forest and by nightmares of you playing it. After that your main goal in life would be to finish this f*****g game as quickly as possible, to escape that madness. But no, even after watching all possible endings it will not be completely over. From time to time you will have those visions, flashbacks...

Conclusion is - while it has all those trashiness of indie game it's scary as hell, and it's overwhelmingly fun to play. I advise you play in coop. I've completed it with different people three times. At some point i felt like member of satanic cult pulling new innocent people into it. It's the best survival crafting game after ARK. That's it."

3176,"Cool game that doesn't outstay its welcome, looking at around 15 hours for the main story. 

It in the middle ground for building variety, you can build a base in the trees, on water and on land, you can build traps, temporary camps, decorations (I only dabbled in it a little as I played on normal, the base building was kind of pointless).

Love the AI system, it keeps you guessing with the enemies, makes for interesting combat (not seen anything like it before).

Had a few bugs when playing, but nothing that hindered gameplay:

Roped into a cave then ended up underneath the map, but it teleported me outside when I climbed back up the rope again (only happened once).
Minor stuttering when near my base for some reason??
When fighting enemies in caves, sometimes they get stuck on the surroundings

Overall a very good game, one of the best survivals I've played.

The only negative thing I can say about the game is that there was no save point past a certain area in the end level (I could have missed a save point or 2, but I feel like I fully explored the last level??)."

And best of all, serious, like hard best of all.  They actually finished the game.  In an age of early access and constant updates, someone actually finished a game and put it to steam and said ""Hey, this is released, not early access.""

3222,"I really don't understand what all that fuss for The Forest was about. I thought I would find a cool world to explore, rewarding base building and ressource collecting but i am really disappointed.

Technically the game feels like an alpha, the UI lacks information on many occasions and it does that thing all the time where you have to find the perfect pixel to aim at to interact with objects, which becomes quickly annoying. The game design is just sloppy.
The world feels so empty and unrewarding to explore. Compared to a Subnautica (which is awesome, go play that instead) for example you will almost never feel compelled by the discovery of a new environment. I explored most of the map and never found an interesting Point of Interest.
The caves have an interesting atmosphere very inspired by the movie The Descent but they feel soooo long and repetitive to explore. Sometimes you will think that you found a cool path that will lead maybe to a shortcut or a cool item but the game under delivers and disappoints once again.
The simplistic combat system makes every encounter frustrating and just not fun. 
Aesthetically i find The Forest to be bland at best. The game looks like it uses stock textures.

I gave it 14h because i wanted more of that sweet Craft-Survival game loop and have been hearing the praises for this game for a long time. Now I know that I haven't been missing anything."

3229,"the survival and building can be grindy and boring at times, but the sense of achievement for some things and the mystery elements that climb to the story end make up for it big time. and the cannibals? well, they start off pretty scary at first, deliberately screwing with you, stalking and being a generally freaky lot to deal with, but they later just become a nuisance to spear to death and drop on top of fires when you run into them. the mutants are a different story however, with the real tension being hiding from groups of them shambling towards your camp, or going for the adrenaline rush of throwing molotovs and spearing them to death in what could be considered the most intense combat sections of the game. oh, and the caves are just straight-up nightmare fuel, don't even get me started.

would i recommend this game? yeah, if everyone i know didn't already know about it or has already played it. did i enjoy it? easy 6/10; it's really cool and fun, with a somewhat half-decent mystery buildup and the eventually full-on endgame part, but not one of my top favourites. getting to the end of the game was more of a relief that the amount of time i put into this actually got somewhere, for better or worse. i still kinda had fun though"

3254,"The Hog Rider card is unlocked from the Spell Valley (Arena 5). He is a very fast building-targeting, melee troop with moderately high hitpoints and damage. He appears just like his Clash of Clans counterpart; a man with brown eyebrows, a beard, a mohawk, and a golden body piercing in his left ear who is riding a hog. A Hog Rider card costs 4 Elixir to deploy. Strategy His fast move speed can boost forward mini tanks like an Ice Golem in a push. At the same time, he can also function as a tank for lower hitpoint troops such as Goblins as he still has a fair amount of health. Most cheap swarms complement the Hog Rider well, as they are nearly as fast as him and usually force more than one card out of the opponent's hand. The Hog Rider struggles with swarms, as they can damage him down and defeat him quickly while obstructing his path. Barbarians in particular can fully counter him without very strict timing on the defender's part, though be wary of spells. A Hunter can kill the Hog Rider in 2 hits if placed right on top of it. However, if you place something in front of the Hog Rider, the Hunter's splash will damage the Hog Rider and hit the card in front of it more. The Hog Rider in conjunction with the Freeze can surprise the opponent and allow the Hog Rider to deal much more damage than anticipated, especially if the opponent's go-to counter is a swarm, or swarms are their only effective counter to him. Skeletons and Bats will immediately be defeated by the spell, while Spear Goblins, Goblins, and Minions will be at low enough health to be defeated by a follow up Zap or Giant Snowball. However, this strategy isn't very effective against buildings as the Hog Rider will take a while to destroy the building, giving the opponent ample time to articulate another counter. Against non-swarm troops, it can deal a lot of damage during the freeze time, but this can allow the opponent to set up a massive counterpush. For this reason, players should either only go for a Hog Rider + Freeze when they have other units backing it up from a counterattack, or if the match is about to end and they need to deal as much damage as possible. It is not a good idea to send in a Hog Rider simply to destroy a building, especially if it is the only building targeting unit available, as defeating Crown Towers becomes substantially more difficult. Spells or simply waiting out the lifetime of the building are more effective. The exception to this is an Elixir Collector placed in front of the King's Tower. If a Hog Rider placed at the bridge, he can destroy the Collector for a positive Elixir trade, though the damage from both Princess Towers will usually mean he does not survive to deal any damage to them. However, if the opponent sends in defending troops, it can be an opportunity to gain spell damage value. In a deck with several low-cost cards, it might be worth it to simply send the Hog Rider against one building. These decks shuffle their card rotation quick enough, that they will arrive to their next Hog Rider before the next building arrives in the opponent's card rotation. Long-ranged troops like Musketeer and Flying Machine can snipe those buildings, preserving some of the Hog Rider's health, possibly allowing it to get some Tower damage. When there are buildings placed in the middle to counter the Hog Rider, understanding the placement of the Hog Rider and the type of building placed can help the Hog Rider to bypass certain buildings. Passive buildings such as spawners and Elixir Collector have a larger hitbox than defensive buildings; which means that if a passive building was placed 3 tiles away from the river in the middle of the opponent's side, then it is impossible for the Hog Rider to bypass that placement as the Hog Rider will get pulled to that building. Defensive buildings have a smaller hitbox than a passive building, which means if that if a defensive building was placed three tiles away from the river in the middle of the opponent's side, a Hog Rider placed at the very left or right side of the Arena may be able to bypass it due to its smaller hitbox. If the player has a building already placed down in the center of the arena, and the opponent tries to bypass it with a Hog Rider at the edge of the arena, they can use certain air troops to push the Hog Rider towards the building as it jumps over the river, effectively denying the bypass attempt. They must be already hovering over the correct placement, as very quick reflexes are required to correctly perform this technique. For Bats, Skeleton Dragons, and Minion Horde, they should be placed right in front of the Hog Rider as soon as it is deployed. For Minions, Skeleton Barrel, Mega Minion, Flying Machine, Electro Dragon, Baby Dragon, Inferno Dragon, Balloon, and Lava Hound, stagger the above placement one tile to the right if the Hog Rider is placed on the left side of the arena, and vice versa. They can also use ground troops to achieve the same result. Something like an Ice Golem deployed at the Hog Rider‚Äôs landing spot will obstruct his path and force him to go around the unit, which causes him to be closer to the building instead of the Crown Tower. The Hog Rider can kite Very Fast non-building targeting troops due to his own Very Fast speed and building only targeting if he is placed on the fourth tile from the bridge, slightly into the opposite lane. He can also stall grounded units when placed right at the bridge. He will pull them towards him while deploying, and then be untargetable by them when he jumps over the bridge. After landing, he will pull them back. This can be useful when the player needs to deal damage in the same lane they are defending. It will also help separate troops behind a tank in a large push. A Tornado placed on the second tile front of the player's King's Tower and staggered two tiles towards the Princess Tower will activate it without any damage dealt to the Princess Tower, helping them in defending future pushes. This can also be a method of mitigating all damage dealt to a Princess Tower, but doing this more than three times may result in the King's Tower's health being low enough to be targeted directly, opening up the possible threat of a back door three crown. A better alternative is to pull the Hog away from the Princess Tower into the attacking range of all three Crown Towers, which will negate all damage as long as none of them are already distracted A very powerful combo is the Hog Rider, the Musketeer, and the Valkyrie, typically referred to as the Trifecta. The Musketeer will defend against most troops, while the Valkyrie can protect her and the Hog Rider from swarms or high damage units. The Hog Rider is used to deal damage to the tower. - [ ] This can be effectively countered by Lightning, one-shotting the Musketeer and severely damaging both the Valkyrie and Hog Rider. The Minion Horde is also effective, but the enemy can Zap them and the Musketeer will one-shot them all. Even if the Musketeer is defeated, the Hog Rider and Valkyrie will have enough time to severely damage the Tower. The Hog Rider should be placed behind the Valkyrie to give it a boost so that it stays in front of the Hog Rider, protecting it. A Hog Rider combined with a Goblin Barrel can be awkward for the opponent to defend against. Timing it so that the Hog Rider is tanking the tower shots for the Goblins is the most effective way to deal damage. However, a Barbarian Barrel can shut this down with minimal Tower damage for a positive Elixir trade, as long as the Goblin Barrel was placed directly on the Tower. Pairing the Hog Rider with the Balloon can deal devastating damage. If executed properly, the Hog Rider will act as a tank while the Balloon threatens to deal massive damage. The Hog Rider can also destroy any buildings attempting to slow down the combo. However, this combo is very vulnerable to swarms and anti-air cards as neither of the troops target anything but buildings."

3274,this game good
3275,"my dad got me this game (he has it to) and all i can say is that its fun
"
3276,aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa
3277,"Best horror/survival game I've ever played, went around with friends for 8 hours spraying naked angry malnourished cannibals and monstrous abominations with hair spray and a lighter and making shitty jokes about axe body spray, went as far as killing the final boss in the game with it.
11/10 Incredible horror game and the most worthwhile ten hours of my life I've ever spent"
3278,"i used to have 200+ hours but made a new account

10/10"
3279,"For People who don't play horror games often or are scared easier, the start of the game will be terrifying, was for me. my first night was the scariest thing in this entire game for me, not knowing what's out there and the sounds of your impending doom waiting to be able to sleep. Though as you progress and get better weaponry as a whole the cannibals are no longer as scary, though the mutants are another story. Even though as a whole i dont like horror based games as much as the average enthusiast the building and crafting aspect kept me going till i had a base i was happy. 7.5/10 I'd Recommend you to get the game 100%."
3280,good
3281,Its not scary its funny
3282,"I am a 45 yo father, probably one of the oldest people playing this game. I am a single father to my Son, who is 14 now. My son got this game for Christmas in 2021 from his uncle, so we installed it on his computer and he started playing. By the end of the week, he had 24 hours on this game. This was horrible for me, as it was already hard for me to find ways to spend time with my son, as he is always out with his friends or just watching YouTube. So I decided to make a Steam account and get this game to see if I could maybe play alongside him. I loaded into the game, picked my character, and started playing but I was stuck on what I was supposed to do. I asked my Son for help and he hosted a game for me to join. I loved it as it was the best time I had spent with my Son since my wife had died. This game has ever since brought me and my son closer again and now we actually spend time together outside the house together as well. This game reminded me that there's fun to be had in everything, and it has brought both me and my Son many happy memories."
3283,"Sometimes i wonder, if it makes you a cannibal, when you eat the meat of your fellow enemies...And yet I think, that in this game it makes you a true SURVIVOR :-)."
3284,etsa bien vergas 10/10 y god
3285,was addicted for about a solid week lol
3286,very cool resomend to small children called timmy
3287,i cant find my son
3288,gaem
3289,extremely fun and scary but not scary
3290,"Game is surprisingly well polished. Never followed it, but seeing it now, it looks amazing. Barely played it, but already having fun. Give it a try!"
3291,This game changed my life. Especially the part with the dead mutant babies in the cave that really hits different.
3292,aggressive naked woman tried to kill me so i cooked and eat her
3293,i only play this at to annoy the neighbors
3294,"yep, fun"
3295,moisturized fanny
3296,minecraft 3D
3297,cool and a little bit spooky game. if you like survival games and like spooky this is a cool game for that. it looks confusing in the beginning but once you actually play the game for like 10 minutes its pretty easy to understand.
3298,balls
3299,The second most fun I've had with naked people in the woods
3300,"Good game, but few bugs like some buildings glitching..."

3305,I've been playing survival games as of late and realized this is possibly one of the best that I've played so far.
3306, This game made me hate the wilderness
3307,"i axed the corpse of the flight attendant for a straight 5 minutes thinking it would give me something for 5 minutes i was slowly but surely losing my mind stabbing a woman repeatedly thinking that i would acquire some form of achievment or item. 5 minutes and nothing but my axe and hands covered with the blood of the deceased flight attendant
this game changes people
10/10"
3308,the forest is an amazing co op and single person game. its always fun to eat other people with your friends
3309,"Doesn't look like much when you walk past, but I was practically dying of hunger so I popped in. The definition of a hole-in-the-wall. I got the regular hamburger and wow...  there are no words. A classic burger done right. Crisp bun, juicy patty, stuffed with all the essentials (ketchup, shredded lettuce, tomato, and pickles). There's about a million options available between the menu board and wall full of specials, so it can get a little overwhelming, but you really can't go wrong. Not much else to say besides go see for yourself! You won't be disappointed.

3310,This game is fun and scary it is amazing and I recommend you play it.

3322,"[h1] [b] [i] Pretty fun and comically stupid [/i] [/b] [/h1]

I think it's utterly fucking [i] brilliant [/i] how this game can go from being [b] the most technically advanced program on my PC [/b] to undeniably being the most [b] [i] broken fucking game [/i] [/b] I ever had the pleasure of purchasing. Absolutely worth playing with a buddy or 2, or 3"
3323,Great fun game Exactly what i was looking for in a survival game. :)
3324,This is one of best and most fun horror survival games I have ever played. With noise cancelling headphones playing in the dark the game really gets you immersed. I recommend to any of those that are into horror and open world world games. 10/10 I love it. It really gets your adrenaline pumping by even hearing rustling of the leaves.
3325,BONESSSS!!!!!!!!!!!!!
3326,birb
3327,oo oo aa aa kill the funny cannibals
3328,Threatened to eat my friend and ended up actually eating him
3329,"its an amazing game especially with friends 
"
3330,"Didn't know anything about this game before I saw it on a good promo and decided to try it out. I love survivals and this one is one of my favorites! Very challenging and unique. Recommend to anyone okay with getting startled and likes a challenge.
Start on a stranded island and have to save your son. As you explore, you encounter cold, hunger, cannibals, mutants, and sharks. Challenging game play and a great story!"
3331,very fun with friends and can be a little scary a some parts but overall great game
3332,"I love almost everything in this game,i love the survival,i love the graphic,i love when it rain,i love how simple this compare to the other forest game that take a place in amazon forest,i love how the horror feel when being chased at night,i love the mechanism,i love the cannibal enemy,i love when they raid my base and then i start panic,i love the cave,i love every item that we can find when exploring cave,i love how fun this game when you play with friends(even my friends who doesn't like survival love this game).
but idk why the sea and water feel kinda empty like why no much fish and not even a single enemy like aligator on the river, and the story in this game is kinda pointless,like i dont really care what will happen with timmy(the son),but that's not the point 'cause this is a survival game so the gameplay is the most important thing in this game
so the score is 9/10"

3340,looks great this game is very difficult but so much fun with friends i definetly recommend playing with some friends tho this game mad hard if u dont know what u doing
3341,lots of cannibal boobies
3342,Naked screaming man ran at me and suddenly my bowels started to move rapidly. Serious review now I haven't played long however so far amazing I've tried VR and PC and the PC version I have to say is slightly better partially because my room gets super hot but you also need a NASA space station pc like me to run it well my friend said his was a little bad but after messing under the VR tab and turning off some stupid settings and making it so I can physically crouch it was good only complaint is objects such as heads on pikes appear to be huge in Vr and smaller on PC.

3399,"Pretty fun and scary game, best played with a friend but still enjoyable solo. Always great if able to get it on sale, but wont hurt if you cant make it. Only issues I've had are the game not being able to be played on higher settings without the game being laggy (Even in low settings it still lags, not sure why as I have decent parts and can play other demanding games on mid-high settings) and this audio bug where everything is delayed and nearly bit-crushed. Aside from those, it hasn't stopped me from enjoying the game."
3400,Survival Best Game ever with multiplayer 8 person nicee
3401,its so rad
3402,Love this game and I'm just waiting for sons of the forest.
3403,"Single player: Man vs. Wild
Multiplayer: naked man chasing u trough the woods
10/10"
3404,This game is worth the money. However it gets pretty boring after you beat the game a few times. I definitely recommend taking the game slow and only figure out things on your own. Multiplayer isn't buggy like most games so you and a few friends can mess around. Watch out for hackers they can really mess up your game.
3405,goated game ong

3495,didn't find timmy. Built a sick log cabin tho
3496,"OH MY GOD! I found my favorite survival game ever. I finished it in single player and now I am playing it with a friend. The story and atmosphere never gets old even if you have played it before. I recommend to play it in single player first so that you can experience the so called ""true horror"" and than you should invite friends. As i said the story is interesting and captivating, the island is beautifully crafted and the game design is great too. Enemies have AI unlike in any other game and the game can be scary even if you're not fighting. Sound design adds to the atmosphere too and the music just creeps in at the right moment. Only thing I have problem with is item spawning. It breaks the immersion at the start but you will get used to it. Overall it is one of the best games I have ever played and I recommend it to anyone who likes horror and survival/crafting games."
3497,good story :D
3498,"Cannot recommend because enemy spawning is immersion breaking for me. Kill a bunch of cannibals, mmore spawn all around you, fine. I built a boat to get away, I couldn't even land anywhere because they literally started appearing out of thin air anywhere I landed. When you can see them pop in to existence on an empty beach with no trees around just to immediately aggro you, game feels forced."

3519,VERY GOOD GAME
3520,"Despite this game being the first, still it feels like a cheap copy of Green Hell.
Buggy gameplay, poor graphics, story made by a 8 year old, survival game with almost no survival elements...
Do not buy this game, unless you want to cut trees and run in a wild with a lighter all the time."

3531,Bunga bunga
3532,"Can't be fucked to give a proper review, so I'll just say this.
My first experiences of this game were falling out of the map and dying, losing all my things and having to get them again. 
My newest experiences were boats flying off into the distance, armor disappearing when I'm not taking damage, and log sleds perpetually falling into the abyss. 
If YOU can deal with the bugs, and REALLY LOVE survival games, go for it. But if I have to play this again, there will be blood. 

Think about it, multiple years to finish and polish the game, and they have yet to clean up this mess of a game. They are now using that money they made not to polish the game, but to make a new one based off of this one's success."
3533,it's really fun. especially when you play with your friends.
3534,if youll see my rust review its pretty much the same here

3539,"Really nice game overall, had a lot of fun with friends/gf . It's a really realistic game set to scare and intrigue you as you discover the wild life and the mysteries of the island ! It's a combination of scary / fun / adventure game which you will for sure like if you played games such as rust/minecraft/raft etc . I wish i could utilize the buildings more and have more ""event"" like zombie outbursts."
3540,This game is so worth it to buy. I suggest asking your friends to purchase it with you so you guys can play it together!
3541,Crippling addiction
3542,:) make me happy
3543,This game is very fun. It is relaxing when you are trying to survive on the island yet scary and challenging when you go out exploring. I have been having so much fun since I acquired it last week. I got it on sale for close to 6 bucks so it was a steal.

3676,"My honest opinions of The Forest. 

1.) I really like the building feature in this game. My friend and I will spend hours upon hours building cool bases to protect us from the hordes of cannibals.  The game also offers a bunch of gadgets that you can build on to your base such as Zip lines, Catapults, Defensive Spikes, and trophy's of dead mutants. 

2.) I think the map is huge and pretty beautiful. You have your wooded areas that contain, waterfalls, lakes, and abandoned cannibals camps. You also have your beach ares that usually have a lot of supplies scattered around, along with more cannibals camps. Then you have your mountain areas of which are littered with snow causing you character to freeze, unless you craft yourself a warm suit. That is a really cool feature that adds to the realism of a survival based game. Finally you have your caves which can usually be found is most areas. These caves are very dark and confusion sometimes. You will need to obtain some scuba gear if you plan on venturing deep into these caves. 

3.) I love/ hate the cannibals. The enemies in this game are none other than the hungry cannibals waiting to leap from the shadows. They usually hunt in packs of at least 4-5 and can be very elusive, and aggressive. But if swarms of angry, greasy cannibals weren't enough to rattle you. This game has mutated cannibals that are absolute bad asses. The most bad ass of them all is know as THE WORM!!! This thing is a base demolishing, dream crushing, time wasting, demon. You will spend real life days trying to make a ballin base, only to get stomped on by a giant worm that spreads itself around like an STD.
The best way to combat this monster is to have plenty of explosives, and or Molotovs.

4.) The combat in this game is 60/40 for me. Its pretty good until you accidentally try to do a charged up home run swing with your weapon causing you to miss, and get your ass kicked. Now maybe im just special but I really don't think i was trying to grand slam these fucking cannibals.

5.) i know its not realistic but i wish i had cross hairs on my bow or something. I'll admit that im not hawk eye but trying to hit these cannibals from long range with the bow is absolutely cheeks. 

Overall Rating : I give this game a 10/10 would recommend. Its fun by yourself, and with your friends."

There is no way to report them or get there steam account to report them. They'll just do it over and over.

3742,Its a little more fun with friends but otherwise a great horror survival game with lots of crafting. I recommend playing in a dark room so then you can see the screen better for night time. Even has a peaceful setting for those who are trying it out to get to know it first. I say 9 out of 10. Could use for crafting things and ideas.

3747,great
3748,"This is a good survival horror game, worth playing if you like this genre. However, in my opinion, not at par with Valheim due to the following reasons (these are based on solo play at normal setting. Mild spoilers ahead):

1. The respawn rate is instant. If I leave a cave or an area and re-enter, the items like sticks, wristwatch etc will always reappear every time.  It defeats the purpose of searching or scavenging, which is the basis of a survival game. The respawn rate should be slower.

2. I can't hotkey the flashlight and the lighter separately. It's ridiculous to open the inventory every time just to switch use between them. Flashlight consumes batteries while lighter has unlimited use.

3. The lighter should consume some fuel from the red can. It shouldn't have infinite fuel, you know, for survival sake.

4. I fell off the cliff and died at the sinkhole. I reappeared in the same cave and hung upside down every time I die. Why the same cave? Why not other caves? I'm dead so I doubt the cannies will still hang me upside down. If this is so, then why the flight attendant still lies flat on the plane? She should be vertical too.

5. The melee fights and range attacks system are terrible. It's not smooth and thorough.

6. Near the crash site, I removed all the debris so that I can build my home and tidy it. After a day or two, all the debris decided to 'move themselves' back to the exact location as before, but this time in my new home!!

Other than those, I like the scenery, the dark caves and the crazy cannibals. It was refreshing to be killed by three homing babies who launched themselves at the same time towards me. Didn't see that coming in all the darkness. 

This game should be played with friends if you are afraid of the dark. Not too difficult to complete the game if you have an army with you."

3776,fun with friends but not so fun by urself
3777,"i saw this for 75% off. so i decide to bought it. because it's quite cheap. and the game is very dark at night time. very hard to see anything. and i need to change my gamma settings to be able to see anything.

it was quite confusing on what to do. so i need to check online for it. because we aren't told what to do. after checking online. i managed to build a tree house and learn how to catch rabbit and kill deer. and how to get clean water.

after that the game kinda bores me. because there is nothing else to do. and exploring caves is not that fun. and too long at cave ruins the player sanity.

i used cheat to disable enemies. because i don't want to kill anyone. even though they are cannibals.
and after 5.2 hours. i quit the game. and decide i'm done with this game. nothing else to do. all i can do is the same thing over and over.

nothing fun to do. that's why i wasn't sure to get this game. when it was launched years ago. and my feeling to not get the game when it was high price is very correct for me.

still deciding on wether or not to uninstall the game or leave it installed. but i'm leaning toward uninstalling it."

QUALITY: Good

SUMMARY:
Solid horror, survival experience game. Game really makes you have to figure the mechanics out. Lots of exploring. Very difficult, even when playing on normal. The caves are nuts. Definitely recommend this game, and look forward to playing its sequel. 

ISSUES: 
No bugs or performance issues detected. 

CONCERNS:
Sometimes the world seems *a little* empty / not interactive. 
Armor gets destroyed very easily. 
Night time, its extra dark. 
Some resources are limited (ex: Pots, Flares, etc).
Too easy to damage / destroy your own stuff. 
Enemies are many, and very difficult, especially when starting out. 
Special tools are very difficult to find, even with Map."
3831,"Awesome game, once again!...Don't know why i have to post this again."
3832,"A decent survival game, where I can't even get past the 5th day without getting eaten by the cannibals living in.. The Forest.

3852,"I played the game alone and with friends and I have to say that I didn't enjoy it much by myself, but once my friends and I turned it on, we really enjoyed it. The story is complete. It is finished quite quickly, like Spider-Man Miles Morales, and like Spider-Man, the open world is also perfect. The graphics are also pretty good for the release date. I wouldn't call it a horror game at all, though, because the bat scared the hell out of me when I entered the cave. I can only recommend the game

3867,"I'm only 11 hours in but this game is exactly what was missing on steam. You can trust the reviews. There is no way I can oversell this. I bought it in special but if I had know how good this game was, I would have paid the full price. Survival, horror, immersive. Nothing is bad in this game. Solo = survival snowball. It's complicated at the beginning but you just keep getting better gear. Coop = Super fun ride. Have fun"

3895,"Initially, The Forest wasn't something I could recommend to anybody due to the poor quality and limited amount of content during initial early access and the sequential updates. But after the reveal of a impending sequel, I figured few opportunities would be better to finally finish the game and fairly weigh it up as a completed product and experience anything new.

I was very pleasantly surprised to find a solid survival-crafting game with some interesting mechanics and a decent story as far as these style of games are concerned, not to mention full co-op story support so you can drag friends along to find out what exactly The Forrest has to offer.

3926,"After playing for a little while, I realized this game is not very good with VR. The experience is ruined by glitches and non-vr events. Walking is very awkward and your hands are virtually useless. You might as well have spheres are blocks, as you can grab absolutely nothing. The game seems to be a VR port, maybe it is. Combat is just swing as as fast as your can, just like pressing buttons on a keyboard. Again, not designed for VR. 

The content in the game is creative and fun. Worth a try for $5, but I would not say it is a great or even good VR title."
3927,"been playing this game for ages now and i love it the combat weapons and crafting are amazing. The storyline was very well written the anxiety you feel exploring caves and walking through the forest at night with cannibals mutants roaming the island and hunting you really gives you good suspense. overall this game was awesome 100% recommended to anyone that likes survival horror games involving mutant creatures. well done endnight!!

cant wait for sons of the forest i can already tell that it will be very famous among players"

3951,nice
3952,Fun
3953,"very fun, especially with friends"
3954,"This is one of those games that inspired new gameplay mechanics that then lead to rip-offs that are often pretty good themselves and well [u]Grounded.[/u]

Zelda games have the adventure gameplay mechanic of needing certain gear in order to proceed into areas that you have previously came across but couldn't continue unless you find the Grappling Hook, or Boomerang, or certain boots etc. This game also has that gameplay mechanic where you need a rebreather, or the climbing axe etc but you can also build and gather resources like a Survival game and defend your base with traps and walls etc.

If you're reading this then you already know this stuff but when you combine the right mechanics together you end up with a great game and this is one of them. I would recommend everyone who plays games to play this but maybe the gore and naked bodies might not tickle your fancy but for me that kinda makes me more driven to take the game a bit more serious like when I was a kid playing Doom back in the day and seeing hellish torture and gore as pixelated and cartoony as it may seem, especially nowadays. Can't wait for the sequel."

3972,"I recommend playing this game in lieu of working if you can manage it - I just died after 10 days (a new record for me) and it was freaking terrifying in parts - and this was playing on my desktop - there is no way I would be able to do this on VR.  So I can confidently say, if this happened in real life I wouldn't last 10 minutes let alone days! Very good game - it's great you can save once you build some kind of shelter, and it's awesome if you want to feel that ""hair raising on the back of the neck kind of fear"""

4011,I was attacked by a naked woman. 10/10
4012,very fun! but only with friends
4013,my favorite survival game of all time good as a solo player but so much better with a group of 3-4 my favorite part is the exploration/crafting while I think my least favorite part is the building which left a lot to be desired and was overall kinda sloppy but that's the only thing that drags it down imo other than that amazing game and I can't wait for the sequel!

4134,Really cool survival game to play with your friends!
4135,Its good
4136,I liked the game but for me after some time it got boring.
4137,please let me smash the naked cannibals
4138,dd
4139,idk something about a forest i dont even know
4140,kill naked people then eat them. dont forget to turn on developer mode so u can troll your new friends. also remeber to make a world last 20 days then forget about thr game
4141,"Aggressive naked men chased me through the woods
"
4142,"would recomend low graphics if you have bad pc but i love this game
"
4143,This game is good for people who have a decent PC and like playing realistic survival game
4144,"very fun, lots of nature"
4145,"One of the best survival games and a phenomenal horror experience, if you have claustrophobia you may want to give it a pass, I played this a few years ago and to this day I recommend this game to my friends and would love to play it again, the crafting isn't super in depth but is incredibly simplified and gives you every thing you need and uses a prefab type system and you fill in the rest and use that to structure your safe space on the island, there is not a better survival horror experience game with crafting i have played. The game did crash very rarely from memory. If you are a fan of Horror games this is not one you should miss."
4146,get a friend to play or the game is dead
4147,"Great survival game to play, multiplayer if you have friends you want to play with. if your thinking about getting it, do it"

4214,"This has to be one of the greatest survival games I have ever played. I think that I was mostly impressed by the overall building and hunting mechanics of the game. the cannibals and mutants made it a challenge to navigate. The first few times I played this game I almost wanted to give up until I started finding the more modern weapons. but once I got my base established, I found it was absolutely amazing to explore."

4237,"game got completed at 10 hours.. not really an survival game, more of an story game disguised as a survival game. not worth full price, but at 4 euro pretty ok. Don't think the developers knew what they were planning for the game. Basically no reason at all to even build anything. Just progress the story and run around looking for cave entrances. 6/10 , decent story I guess.


The inventory and building is really awfull but I see what they were going for!
recommended if you play with someone and buy it on sale!"

4241,"I love this game. It is one of the best horror survival games out there. Even if it is one of the older ones and doesn't have the ULTRA amazing grafics or so, it is so nice and fun to play. The atmosphere is still scary not matter how often you play it. And it is such an awesome game to play together with friends, makes it even more fun. And the building or crafting you can do in the game is so cool and there is so much. The good thing is, if you're scared or not good at fighting you can also play without monsters and just survive and build stuff you want. I can just say, it is a game everyone should play at least once :D"

Still one of the most fun survival horrors out there."
4273,its a fun game . the key area is survival ..the combat feels abit clunky..but the katana is best for that..sometimes it can be a bit grindy ..but that the way with these types of games...the sale atm makes it a good choice ....
4274,"nake women, nice game"
4275,"Ah the true simulator of being a lumberjack.
Arrive at an untamed forest. So many trees ready for felling and woodworking.
Start the game with an axe that won't break? Perfect.
Begin cutting trees for my cabin, gazebo, and shed.
Just like a lumberjack, the local tweekers don't take kindly to my lumber ways. Fortunately, I have an axe.
During the day, I collect logs and build. During the night, I sleep or fend off the local tweekers.
What a wonderful game."
4276,This is a very frustrating survival game. I spent a lot of time in the caves thinking this is going to be impossible to beat but after 2 force quit moments i finally gave it a second try. I know that this is cheating but turning on cave light cheat and build hack really helps the frustration of the game. But really those are the few things that are really helpful in the game. Other than that I really enjoy this game. I've been wanting to play a lot of survival games and this game is perfect.

4333,"Good game, if a bit dated now"
4334,"ITS STILL AMAZING AFTER ALL THIS YEARS
"
4335,it's so fun whit friends and interesting game :D
4336,"On one hand I understand the high score, it's survival, crafting and building game with an actual story. Except it also has quite a bit of bugs. In just 3 hours I encountered several including items (a pot) duplicating when the fire goes out and when loading a save the structure I made was suddenly moved a meter up in the sky. Lastly the developers don't seem active anymore, meaning these and many other bugs will simply never be fixed."
4337,"This game is just not fun. Most of your time seems spent either getting food or water with no time for doing anything else. It eventually eased after building a drying rack and gaining a turtle shell to collect water, but even then food and water management takes up a large portion of your time.

The game boasts building mechanics, but if you build anything, it attracts 'the locals' who take great umbrage and flatten it. I eventually gave up and looked online and the recommendations there are to either build on an island or to build 'minimilistically' to keep your footprint down. Where is the fun in that?

Indeed, all the advice on-line is that stealth is king and to keep moving. So if you like stealthy play and always being on the move, then this is the game for you. If you like to build a base/mansion/castle and forage out from there, don't bother, this is not the game for you. Buy/play Valheim instead, as it's more fun.

Oh, and the night cycle lasts for ages, absolute ages. You can sleep, but the forest re-grows whilst you do so, and if you like to build, then it's an absolute pain in the neck. The only way round it, is not to sleep. Leave the game running, tab out, go do something else, then come back when it's daylight again.

My game time is longer than the two hours recorded as I was playing off line, and it was on medium difficulty.

To quickly recap, if you like stealth shooter games then you might like this, if you like base building games or where base building is an integral part of the game, avoid."
4338,"so the game of life is a very intense and conceptual game that takes shear willpower to conquer and this is the most i have ever came to being the number one at life because this game brings great responsibility over the player and makes sure that the adventure is a journey that is one that needs to be completed

4354,"I do not understand how this game has so many positive reviews. It still feels like an unfinished early access title.  The building and crafting are shallow. The combat is...just bad. I tried with this one, I really did, but it's trash."

The story is really cool with two different endings, the building and crafting is really fun. Also definitely makes you poop your pants on multiple occasions! For sure keeps you on your toes and super alert when you leave your base. I can't wait for the sequel!!!"

4390,one of the best story/survival game that i've ever played
4391,yah
4392,"This game has a large island to explore and a shockingly small amount of things to do. The gameplay loop of eat, gather, explore cave, repeat, gets old quickly. The base building and crafting is incredibly simplistic. Inventory management is a nightmare; by far the worst I've ever seen. The story is vague and confusing (although some people may enjoy its passive story telling style). The enemies have terrible AI, often running around in circles for no reason. Combat has some issues, but isn't completely terrible.
At the end, your payoff is about an hour of interesting content and then you're done."
4393,Very good story and game play overall an 8.5/10
4394,"To put it lightly peace was never an option, madness and chaos are the only option. got dynamite blow em up make their buddies watch their other buddy turn into globulous chunks of meat goo, got fire roast a cannibal eat his leg too. or use it as an impromptu weapon, who cares timmy can wait a whole year or ten!"

4484,"I really don't get the fuzz about this game. It's exclusively fun with friends.

This game is filled with bugs, weird issues...

Cannibals just punch your walls down but okay, it's a small price to pay, would have been too hard to make something better.
Animals run away from you [i]some times[/i], and when they do, they can literally run inside the water. But hey, that's also too hard to do better, so we'll pass. Nevermind the map being static, they could have done some kind of boxes of where to not go, but hey, what do I know...
There's no crosshairs because throwable items go wherever they want on the screen, but always in the same exact direction so you can learn where to aim. Completely realistic, just like in real life, and not annoying at all.
Me and my friends just learned by playing how to make fire arrows and we just got on top of rocks to cheese the bosses. Just like we would in real life, so that's also realistic. Very well.
Picking up water with a cauldron... yeah good luck getting the exact pixel of where to get it before going completely mad. No, it's not that you can't pick certain water, it's probably just a bug since moving around a lake that looked like it had ""uncollectable water"" was just a mere troll, as my brother found the exact 2 cm of water where you could pick water (and the animation I did was facing inside so it looked like I picked sand, very realistic)

This game is the perfect example of a REALLY good idea with solid design, since at least it has some purpose and the crafting, etc. is well thought, being a fun experience. As for the technical part it completely got me off the immersion and we just did a mansion in the main camp to mog the cannibals.

And the framerate... lol, I'm gonna blame Unity for that one but I very well know I shouldn't.

9/10 design, 2/10 in the technical aspect. It should be a 5.5/10 but that's hardly recommended by me... Also, just like in SCP Pandemic a solid character controller doesn't make for an enjoyable game a solid design doesn't hide the fact this game is at times [b]very[/b] annoying to play.

I'll keep playing it to get to the end with a friend and my brother but, again, I don't get the fuzz."

4487,AMAZING GAME
4488,oh no don't eat me!!!

4497,nice
4498,you get to murder people
4499,"I read the game description, I'm going to end up in a plane crash and have to survive. Okay. The game starts, I have a child. The child's name is Timmy. I didn't ask to parent a kid and would never name it Timmy, so sounds fake.
Turbulence, crash.
My mind goes ""that escalated quickly"" even though I knew I would crash. Oh wait, some person is dragging my kid away. Start exploring, find a camp with creepy heads and body parts, totally normal stuff. Find a water source and and roast some lizard over a fire, boom I'm surviving out chere. Third night some naked people attack me? I wake up in a cave, bodies everywhere, maybe a map, a bad drawing or two I exit the cave and go back to my camp
I open my backpack and see a photo of Tommy and two drawings maybe he drew? Kid seems traumatized based off the drawings.

So anyway, I started chopping trees.

The sap god protects all... Except from 6 legged mutant things, watch for those.
"
4500,"Out of all the Survival games I have played, The Forest is the best, and believe me I have played a lot. If you are looking for experiencing how it feels to survive on a Peninsula with the terror of being caught and killed by Cannibals and different breeds of monsters plus exploring dark caves, this is the game for you. If you are a fan of survival games, I would definitely recommend this game."
4501,i like eating their arms and legs
4502,Great fun
4503,Bones
4504,This is the best survival multiplayer game i have honestly ever played! it is so much fun! The feeling of exploring those creepy caves with a friend late at night is so awesome!!! If you want it to be even more spooky try it in VR its so fun!
4505,very good game
4506,"Really cool, I very much enjoyed my play through.

Except for one thing that really irked me.
We'd spent all this time building our cool base, full walls, spikes around the whole thing, traps at the entrances...
Then a couple big guys spawned and attacked, and destroyed it all. We had like half the walls left. Everything else was totalled.
Gave a weird feeling - do they want me to build a base or no? Cause the game plays like I have to protect the base more than it protects me.
From that moment, a bad taste was left in my and my co-op partners mouths, and we decided to go underground and just finish the story. We literally never needed to go back to the base. Food and water was plentiful in the caves.

Really weird. Hopefully the next one makes the base building actually somewhat necessary. You could play this game by just building the smallest shelter at the start then just doing the story."
4507,"The freaking naked enemies scare the shit out of me every time they run to attack me, LIKE BRUH JUST LET ME BUILD MY DAMN HOME AND BASE IN PEACE!!!!
MFS will be TERRIFIED if you decide to go down that cave with the baby looking monsters out to get you.
AND ISTG. Do not play this alone."

Building is also very fast and easy to do. But after playing the game for a short while you reach the end and there is not much to do anymore after that in my experience. The world doesn't change, even when starting a new game."

4614,"Really disliked this one. Had a lot of potential with the unique AI and the way the enemies reacted to you. The dead mutant babies and things were just silly after a while. Didn't care about the story or ""saving my son"" because they really give you no reason to care about him. 

Things I liked: Building system, gathering logs and such, the sleds for resource carrying, etc.. Those were very well done. 

IMO: The game didn't know whether it wanted to be a survival game or a horror game, so it tried to do both and fell short. If this was more of a survival game, I think I would have loved it. But the horror elements were really where I just had no interest."

Final Thoughts
This game was so fun and had so much replay value to me that I played it with a friend on Steam and a friend on PS4. There are a few little things I wished they improved like the aiming systems and picking things up, generally making the more mundane or precise things a bit easier, but I cannot deny it is fun to learn how to aim at something from far away. This game will definitely keep you on your toes, and I enjoyed the story.

Seeing that ""Sons of the Forest"", the sequel to this game, is coming out, I'd suggest picking this up to play through, so you are ready to play the sequel when it comes out."
4689,I'm obsessed
4690,Very fun
4691,"i would recommend this game because you could finish the game 5 times and still have more you could do its simply because you could build tribes in multiplayer find harder ways to play and also you can meet other people who might enjoy the game just as much as you might and you get to play with a multitude of people all adapting to work together or hunting each other.

this has been one of my favourite games for about 2 years now i come back to it from time to time just replaying it with new people helping them learn how to survive and its juat something you can go to for laughs with friends."
4692,Amazing
4693,"Fun, better with others."
4694,o
4695,fun to play with friends
4696,"spawn into game, watch timmy get stolen by red man, leave plane, night time, get cold, hears scream, friends?, cannibal yeet into me, scream, run, no stamina, turn around, gone?, armsie come walk through forest, throws me off cliff, game end."
4697,"Great game, i would recommend it to any person who likes exploring and slight horror. Very fun."
4698,NONONO this game gave me go through 6 pairs of underware. its a hard game but im looking foward to the sequel
4699,"I like the horror and mystery aspects of it.  It's pretty difficult on single player, but still worth the experience if you haven't tried it yet."

"
4706,great game
4707,yes
4708,this game covers most of my fetishes. highly recommend!!++
4709,forest game
4710,"There's not much to the combat, it's janky and simplistic. I'm not a big fan of the map and how you find your way around but that's just my opinion. 

Caves are pretty lacklustre and all look the same. AI is pitiful. You need to eat/drink every few minutes which I don't find fun. 

Base building could be fun but building requirements are REALLY onerous. I have tried hosting but just seem to get cheaters all the time using dev commands that I don't seem to be able to stop - if anyone knows how, please tell me so I can at least enjoy building with others."
4711,this game is overall great its fun in vr too because it gives a thrill of fear and excitment
4712,I just love it when cannibals feed off my dying body
4713,Couldn't find any animals to eat so I cannibalized the cannibals so I didn't starve
4714,"The best survival game out there easily. In the forest you can build houses and kill cannibals. Also watch out for the Titans. Me and my friends call them ,buster, armsy, and 4 legs. Pro tip if you decide to build a town with your friends you should build it in a lake, because cannibals and the Titans can't swim. I think this game is easily 5/5"
4715,very good game very funny i recomend you play with friend
4716,very good game
4717,Very fun especially when you blow up and chop half naked mutant woman with an axe and burn their bodies for armour.
4718,slayed
4719,WOULD NOT RECOMMEND.
4720,its full of stuff to do.   its an amazing game!!!
4721,"The gameplay experience is appealing for survival craft lovers.
Personally, my favorite way of playing the game is in peacefull mode only, since I enjoy relaxing and hearing the sounds of the nature without wondering if every creak is a mutant canibal monster XD 
Playing in peacfull is actually relaxing and prevents anxiety while playing (which I stuggle with alot)"
4722,"good 
"
4723,"The game is great in co-op.
Even though the story is not very long, exploring is fun, fighting is fun, and building is fun"
4724,"If you're looking for a review on this game you've come to the wrong place, but if you're looking for an outstanding pie recipe you've come to the right place.

Ingredients:

1. 6 tablespoons unsalted butter
2. 1/2 cup white sugar
3. 1/2 cup brown sugar
4. 1/4 cup water
5. 1/4 teaspoon cinnamon
6. 1 pinch salt
7. 5 apples - peeled, cored and sliced
8. 1 pastry for double-crust pie

Directions:

1. Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C).
2. Combine butter, white sugar, brown sugar, water, cinnamon, and salt in a saucepan over medium heat. Bring to a boil, remove from heat and set aside.
3. Roll out half the pastry to fit a 9-inch pie plate. Place bottom crust in pie plate; pour in apple slices.
4. Roll out top crust into a 10-inch circle. Cut into 8 (1-inch) wide strips with a sharp paring knife or pastry wheel. Weave the pastry strips, one at a time, into a lattice pattern. Fold the ends of the lattice strips under the edge of the bottom crust and crimp to seal.
5. Pour butter-sugar mixture over top of pie, coating the lattice, and allowing any remaining sauce to drizzle through the crust.
6. Bake in the preheated oven for 15 minutes. Reduce heat to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C), and bake until the crust is golden brown, the caramel on the top crust is set, and the apple filling is bubbling, 35 to 40 more minutes. Allow to cool completely before slicing."
4725,"The Forest is mostly good. It's certainly a fun open world survival craft game with friends and can be a solid horror experience solo. The entire open world survival craft aspect is pretty excellent, especially compared to almost all the other games in this genre. There's tons of items to find and resources to gather and manage; as well as a large and detailed map to explore. I do like this game but there are some significant problems that should be pointed out. As a general rule of thumb you get what you pay for, and $5 was worth it but at $20 I'm not so sure.

Without any spoilers it has plenty of great elements but it still feels like an early access game even though it says it isn't; bugs and glitches are still fairly rampant and more than a few times they almost killed me and my drive to play the game. The game is missing some polish on fairly key elements like combat and world interaction. The game is also lacking a fair deal of instruction on mechanics that I found led me to looking at the wiki, which can be detrimental to the overall experience but necessary if you don't want to spend the first 3 hours getting ass-blasted over and over. Just a tiny bit more info would have helped this greatly. Also the in-game map you can find is not very accurate; some points on the map are off. Combat is 50/50. It's fun when you're stun locking enemies into a coma and trash when you're being stun locked into a coma. 

With SOME SPOILERS the story is rather lacking especially toward the end. It is very mysterious and cryptic at first, which leads you to push to learn more. But at a certain point you suddenly see where the story is going and the rest is very predictable. The game should really not be called the Forest since you spend comparably little time in the forest and instead most of your time in the caves. Also there are massive elements/sections of the game you can skip entirely and still beat it; the entire mountain section of the peninsula is pointless. Also enemy encounters in those caves are scripted, and will be the same enemies every time.

My biggest problem is that it still feels like early access but it isn't. If anything it feels like this whole game was a tech demo to lay the groundwork for The Forest 2 which they seemed to tease at the end of the story. I enjoyed this game for $5 but I'm very unsure of the replay value past the time I have spent, and I can't recommend the game to anyone but the most patient open world survival craft players out there. Maybe i will change to Recommended if the game gets some solid updates."
4726,awesome game
4727,bitch stole my child
4728,i have only played this game for 9 hours now but there is nothing more satisfying than brutally slaying crippled babies and cuting them into pieces with my katana
4729,so to begin me and my friends bought this game or rather they convinced me to buy it while it was on sale as a survival game and I also thought it was going to be a horror game but its much more of a survival game than anything so anyways I did not know what to expect when playing this and it turned out to be pretty good I guess because we created a tree house that saved us from the monster things and eventually we explored a little bit and deforested a lot of the spawn area to find the beach I just remembered when we first started we had no clue who the monsters were so we stumbled upon that container with the electronics parts that have the weird dudes around them and I remember that they were kinda scary ngl I had to run and then I discovered that you could kill the animals and so we had a bunch of food but thats kinda all I can remember because we logged off at a yacht at some point and then eventually months and months later even more friends get the game and begin a little survival thing and then my friend Adrian AKA Red A made a The Forest video with their experience and they definitely went much further into the story and survival aspect of the game oh I just remembered that we had a boat eventually because we had a failed fort on the water that we tried making actually it was on the beach but anyways vinny came back because I just remembered that he went exploring very far also those houses are really weird that they make I think they're a trap but anyways yeah he had a boat and then we built off of that but then we stopped playing anyways back to the topic where Adrian made the video and got super far compared to before so I started playing with them and we went on a cool expedition to this massive hole in the ground that I had no clue existed bc I somehow never explored there but we did find a little pond nearby with the tall stick structure in the middle that you can climb on and there was a destroyed boat on the edge of the water by the rocks that I remembered going to and then I drank the water or something and got sick but idk if I remember correctly anyways vinny fell into the bottom and that was kinda cool and it was hard for me and josh to keep up to try and find the entrance to said hole and we eventually found it and it was very cool and a little scary fighting off the creature things because I hate hate hate low light games and all they give you basically is a temporary flashlight or a very dim lighter so that is a no in my book but anyways yeah we got down to the middle and got some new loot and I also discovered that there was dynamite which I used a little earlier on to blow some stuff up and im sorry that I did it because I killed some people and destroyed some sort of trophy but I do not think anyone remembers but anyways we got to the bottom of the hole and there was a small boss fight ig and we skipped a few caves on the way there but I think that is what you are supposed to do but there was a helicopter crashed in the middle kinda and I got into it and I got soft locked for like 30 seconds and started panicking but eventually I realized I am the best Minecraft Builder in the Poker Discord  and got myself out and there was a machete and a super cool suit that everyone wore and then eventually someone else got stuck even though I told them not to I think it was Alex but he got out and then we made a camp on the top of the rock in the center and then logged off and when I came back everyone had already left the hole together leaving just me at the bottom and then I had to wait for Marco to come save me because I tried to make my way out and I kept hearing the creature noises and it was super dark so it was very scary to try and get back up on my own and I probably would not have made it back on my own bc it took us like 10 minutes to get down in the first place and a whole bunch of parkour was required to get down and back up and there was no way I was gonna remember how to do it bc I would die and lose my stuff and have to run back to the cave and get my stuff and run back out and yeah so Marco saved me and then we all went right back to a cave that may have been in the hole I think it was and then started the end game mission which required us to kill many creatures and then eventually we made it into this lab sorta thing but justin caused adrian to glitch out of the map somehow and I was very mad at him for it and tried killing him or making him angry but it did not work because he has a slightly better reaction time than me and then something happened to alex with his internet and he disconnected and relogged all the way back at the beginning of the cave basically and then vinny had to use his hacks to attempt to get them both back but it pretty much took two hours and we were just sitting in the lab the whole time with nothing to do and finally everyone is back and then we go through the mission and find timmy and put him on life support from the big alien egg thing and then rocco who was the one who activated the cutscene thing glitched out and we had to wait for him to get back so all in all we waited for like 3 hours and then finally we get to the big area where the kid turns into a multi leg monster and we kill it easily and then give timmy his life or something like that and then after that we go to the weird alien box in the sky and decide to shoot down the plane overhead instead of letting it go and then that turns into us getting saved somehow and then us and timmy are on a talk show and he turns into a monster I think but I cannot remember clearly bc I was gonna go get fried and did not care about the game by the end and then timmy has to take pills to not turn into a monster or something but yeah thats the end and then after that I went to my friends house to get fried and I have not touched the game since nor has any of my friends I do not think anyways go check out the videos on Red A channel they were pretty good ngl good job Adrian with those videos you have made massive improvements and I like having our gameplay recorded bc you edit it very well anyways that is the end of my The Forest Review and I would recommend it but only if you get it on sale bc it is really only like 5 dollars worth of content in this game so yeah thumbs up bye.
4730,"Excellent game. The story seems like a trope up front, but it expands into something really enjoyable and creepy. Building is very well balanced. The combat is fine and the enemies are well designed. Audio is so creepy as well, almost scarier than the cannibals themselves. Had a ton of fun playing this co-op."
4731,"THJISZ GAM<E SUCCCKKKKKKKSSSSSSSSS BALLS IN THE ASS I PLAYED WIHT MY BROTHEERA DN HE SHIT HIS PANTS AND THEN SDMAERED IT ALL OVER TYHE WALLS AND MADE MY DOGS LICK IT UP AND THEN THEY THREW UP AND ATE IUT AND POOPED IT NBOUT ANDF THEN MY BROTHER SMEARED IT ON THJE CEILING AND NOW M,Y WALLS SMELL LIKEN POOP AND THROW Y76G9P UP"
4732,It's like Minecraft for the big boys with some scary aspects and a harder survival difficulty. Nonetheless even the hardest setting is quite easy. I can recommend it although it can get tedious and boring sometimes when you don't know what to do.
4733,god
4734,Its a good game just a little difficult if you don't know what your doing I would recommend watching some tutorials before hand would really help also this game will piss you off its normal at this point.
4735,brilliant game even now after years of it coming out
4736,i like that there is child abduction in this game and also cannibalism with a lot of dismembered bodies

4779,"Game is extremely fun to play with friends. If you enjoy a survival challenge, play by yourself. However, I have found it much more enjoyable and easier to play with friends. The mechanics work decent and the graphics are nice even if you have to run them at a low setting because of your very crappy graphics card :) There are a few bugs and glitches here and there but nothing that should affect your gameplay. All in all, good game; very exciting, very enticing and a great past time for you and your friends."

4816,wood
4817,Nice
4818,"I'm hosting a game for a group of around 5 friends and we didn't realise that if someone exits the game before I save, their progress is lost. Okay, maybe we shouldn't have expected such an intuitive feature in the first place, but now that we know about this, we can at least deal with it and just save more frequently.

Anyway, we decide to go explore a cave again so that everyone can have their loot again. And everything goes just fine until we get to exit. I dive up first from the exit and wait for my friends - two of them crash, losing all progress made again. Sh*t.

Also, it's just a not a particularly interesting game after a few hours. There's only few enemy types, and killing the cannibals every fifteen minutes makes the combat boring. And as for the building, it's somewhat entertaining for a few hours while you're still figuring the system out, but the material gathering gets extremely tedious after a while, since you're mostly chopping trees. And because they're mostly made of wood and stone, don't expect much variety.

If you see this game go for 5 dollars and you don't have anything else to do with your time, maybe then consider buying it, but otherwise I can't recommend."
4819,so much lag

4831,"I couldn't see the story ending - it's tough for the beginners yet it's a great game especially if you enjoy adapting in the cannibal island. Day1 I cringed in terror when I hear cannibal's laughter, suffered from hunger and thirst. Around day 30 situation reversed. I have multiples of clean water sources and too many dry meats and snacks. I hunt down cannibals with my nice bow and arrows. If there are too many, I shoot them from high up in my treehouses feeling safe and sound. Sometimes I burn them alive with molotoves and I burn their corpses again to get bones. I invade their territory, steal their items with my heads held high. I tried some of the caves to end the story, but I stopped because it was a little bit tiring to hunt cannibals - they also evolve and don't let me finish the story."

If you're looking for a review on this game you've come to the wrong place, but if you're looking for an outstanding pie recipe you've come to the right place.

Ingredients:

1. 6 tablespoons unsalted butter
2. 1/2 cup white sugar
3. 1/2 cup brown sugar
4. 1/4 cup water
5. 1/4 teaspoon cinnamon
6. 1 pinch salt
7. 5 apples - peeled, cored and sliced
8. 1 pastry for double-crust pie

Directions:

1. Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C).
2. Combine butter, white sugar, brown sugar, water, cinnamon, and salt in a saucepan over medium heat. Bring to a boil, remove from heat and set aside.
3. Roll out half the pastry to fit a 9-inch pie plate. Place bottom crust in pie plate; pour in apple slices.
4. Roll out top crust into a 10-inch circle. Cut into 8 (1-inch) wide strips with a sharp paring knife or pastry wheel. Weave the pastry strips, one at a time, into a lattice pattern. Fold the ends of the lattice strips under the edge of the bottom crust and crimp to seal.
5. Pour butter-sugar mixture over top of pie, coating the lattice, and allowing any remaining sauce to drizzle through the crust.
6. Bake in the preheated oven for 15 minutes. Reduce heat to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C), and bake until the crust is golden brown, the caramel on the top crust is set, and the apple filling is bubbling, 35 to 40 more minutes. Allow to cool completely before slicing."

My first mistake was turning around not caring and starting to laugh, after that I turned around again to check if they're okay, well they were, I WAS NOT. I LET OUT THE MOST BLOOD CURLING, WOLF DYING LIKE SCREECH WHICH MADE ME RETHINK MY GENDER. Would recommend, also pay attention 10/10"

4860,"Very good game, I perfect obsess over and play for a ton then find a new game or pick an old one and then go back to it. It's a good game, although to be honest i've never beat the game. I kind of just build a civilization for myself and live life. I mean, i'm sure Timmys or is it tommy? i dont know, but i'm sure the kids fineee. It's like minecraft, You KNOW you CAN beat the ender dragon and at some point you might but until then you make a home and explore and you know, live. It's like that, I KNOW i can save tommy or get him back or whatever, i dont know the lore- But i mean, eventually. Until then, kill a few animals, build a home, get better gear. Yeah, 10/10 would recommend!"
4861,"great semi-horror survival game - lit so you can SEE the enviro, but forest is heavy enough you cannot always see the monsters.  Hear it coming - catch a glimpse - run  or fight!   Build a shelter so u can sleep thru the dark nights.   Or if you like the dark, stay up late or enter a cave to hunt badder stuff.  love. it."

5000,"To be fair, I'd give a sideways thumb on this one if I could. I played with one other, and we enjoy playing coop survival games together. The reason I'm giving this a downvote, is that I feel it was pretty overrated.

The main game progression consists of going through caves to get necessary items to complete the game. The caves feel... pretty much the same. You run through, fight the same types of monsters (cannibals and a couple diffeerent types of mutants), and run around tediously looking for items to allow you to go to the next cave, etc. 

I did have enough curiosity to wanna finish the story, which was a more interesting part of the game. It's just that the gameplay was just hard to enjoy after a while.

We've played Valehim, Age of Conan, Raft, and more and I'd say this one ranks pretty low on my list (close to how I felt about Raft). By the way, I'm not speaking on behalf of my gaming partner, that seemed to enjoy the game more than I."
5001,"GREAT GAMES
"
5002,"I love this game a ton. It's super fun to play with friends, but alone is fine too. 
The crafting is simple but can be very confusing for some parts.
I didn't get super into this game though until I found out about the story. I was at about 40 hours in it before I started exploring the story with my friend and it made the game so much better. There is so much hidden lore to uncover.
Really looking forward to Sons of the Forest."

5034,"This game doesn't offer anything unique, something that has been done many times before, not to mention it stayed in early access for 4 years. I wanted to like this game but i simply didn't enjoy it."
5035,Very well polished and just an overall great feel to a survivor game. Excited for the future of the franchise with a continuation releasing at the end of 2022. Been playing this game since the beta versions and have always loved it since.

Genre: Open-World Survival Crafting Horror
Setting: An island. You're a survivor of a plane crash.

To do: Chop trees, gather plants, hunt animals, build camps, craft gear, explore dark caves, make friends with the local cannibals, pretend the mutants don't exist, look for other survivors along the way, and maybe more importantly find your son.

Tips / Guide: Loot the plane crash site and get out of there before night falls. You'll now have the axe, meds, food, drinks, alcohol, cloth,... Also gather stones, sticks, and leaves. Look up a map of the island online. The local cannibals have regular patrol routes. Build a hunting shelter and a firepit in a safe spot the cannibals don't patrol near. Save. It's actually safer to build more smaller camp sites spread across the island and run from place to place, than it is to building one big base, staying there and having to defend it endlessly from increasingly harder attacks. The patrols get larger as days go by. Nights are especially dangerous (and scary) as the cannibals will be looking for any fire light source. Craft a bow and arrows and/or a spear. Go hunt. Drink from puddles. Eat from bushes. Build some more shelters along the way. Craft the warmsuit armor, as it makes you immune to cold and wet. You're now prepared to explore the island, the cannibal villages, and the caves. Good luck on your adventure,... I mean your search for your son Timmy."

There's a couple small game-play issues, (difficult UI, multiplayer has some issues, features that are neat in theory but don't really do much), but what this game brings far outstrips those few issues.

5199,Great game
5200,"Why should you play this game? 1. there are TONS of weapons and tools in this game that can help you survive in The Forest. 2. mechanics like blocking attacks can help you survive against most of these horrifying monsters that are in The Forest. 3. most of the time when you start a new multiplayer game you will meet new people. before i started playing The Forest, i have only 2 friends. after playing The Forest, i have over at least 10 friends now!! 4. molotovs and fire everywhere."

5204,"This game has remained somewhat of a classic for me over the years. I've played it many times for hours on an end and beaten it every way you can imagine. Whether you want to just have a good old adventure in the forest without cannibals, or you want to basically commit war crimes - this is the game for you!"
5205,"What a boring, monotonous game.  Explore for 5 minutes -- get hungry  and thirsty.  Find a way to gather things to satisfy those urges.  Explore for 5 minutes, become nervous that daylight is burning and need to build shelter and/or return to camp before night (as good luck doing anything productive at night).  Possibly explore for 5 more minutes before becoming hungry and thirsty again.  Rinse and repeat.

From other reviews, it seems like others have enjoyed it, so to each their own -- but not for this guy."

5214,"its ok but boring unless you have alot of friends in which i dont

"
5215,"Great atmosphere, I love eating families <¬£¬£"
5216,good
5217,Mass genocide of the native
5218,"it's just too difficult. impossible to find water, you're literally IN WATER and you can't drink it, there is a tiny spot within a couple of lakes where it allows you to drink, nowhere else. you're always dying of thirst. it's difficult to kill animals for food, but if you do, it doesn't cure ""health"" loss, just hunger. it's almost impossible to cure health once you've used up the little bit of free meds. aloe vera restores only a tiny bit of health, you can only plant one tiny plant in your garden and it takes a long time to grow, and if you're out exploring, that's not gonna do you any good anyway.

then there's the monsters. just constantly attacking and way stronger than you. even on ""normal"" mode. there isn't an ""easy"" mode, normal is the easiest. and it isn't easy at all. even with friends this game is mostly just frustrating, and not very fun. the ""survival"" idea is okay, but the monsters ruin it, and yet the world would get boring fast if you turn off the monster mode and all you do is survive."
5219,yum
5220,"NGL, but I think I am in a forest."
5221,"Ah the Forest
what can I say about the forest?
This game is very very fun, I've finished it a few times now
the story isn't the most compelling and the physics can be wacky at times but my FPS survival game loving heart cant recommend the game enough
every time I've played this its been with a friend and honestly, working together to beat up cannibals while trying to build a fort is a great bonding experience
especially if they're going into the game blind and have no idea what to expect
all-in-all I would say if you're looking for a chaotic game to play with a friend or two, this one may just be what you need"
5222,i only been playing it for one day and im scared a little kid asked me if he could skin my family then when i said yes AS A JOKE he said what state i live in
5223,"The Forest I'd say was probably one of first games to introduce proper survival and realism. Over the years it has updated quite a bit but after that came Stranded Deep and Raft. Kind of more similar games. I love The Forest, I had gotten the game way back around 2015 - 17 and I have been loving playing the game ever since."

"
5226,"Probably one of the best survival games ive played, has lots of good horror element etc. Hopefully second game can live up to its expectations (hopefully its not security breach all over again)."
5227,"like: I got wamen
dislike: the wamen attacked me

also dislike: friends quitting right before boss fight and never went back again"
5228,Funny log sled goes brrr
5229,fun
5230,My kid is dead
5231,Not too bad for a survival game. It is fun I enjoy playing it and really it is a great game :D

5236,cool game highly recommend playing co-op can definitely still be enjoyed in single player to though
5237,Good!
5238,I got jumped by naked Cannibals
5239,"So tired of losing stuff every time we leave the game.  Have a dedicated server with only my kids and my wife with access - every time we go back, something is gone.  My base is gone, my boat is gone - something.  I have everything still in my backpack, so it remembers some things, but not others.  Too frustrating - don't want to start over every time I play.  I'm done with this game."

5255,"I [b]DO NOT CARE[/b] about Timmy.
They actually did [i]me[/i] a favour by taking him off my hands.. I was finally free.
I chopped many trees, chopped (and ate) many people, and unintentionally fell down many holes.
And yet- Timmy haunted me.
His terrible drawings and scattered toy pieces served as a reminder that in order to finish this game and become a true gamer girl I probably had to locate my hideous offspring.
So, I persevered.
I found there to be a lot of lore thrown at me really quickly towards the end and the only thing I was truly excited about was when I found the connection between a cannibal island and my beloved orange 'sodi-pops'.
Other than that, the ending was mostly straight up disappointment.
[spoiler]I wish there had been a spot to save (maybe there was) before choosing an ending so I could live out my Timmy-free dreams, but I honestly thought I would get to go grab people from another downed plane, so I saved him.....:( .[/spoiler]

5290,"This is one of the best games I have ever played. It doesn't hold your hand and shove tutorial messages and icons in your face; it lets you discover things for yourself. Its challenging but not frustratingly difficult. Its a great coop game as well as working just as well in single player. I started the game thinking it was just a cool zombie sandbox game with no story, boy was I wrong. Once I started uncover what is really going on I couldn't put the game down."
5291,NOOOOOOOO JIMM- timmy? tim.. JIMMY!!!!!!!!!
5292,"This is one of my absolute favorite games ever. The sandbox aspect combined with the lore and just going into it not knowing anything is one of the greatest things in a survival game. 10/10 I'm buying the second one. Tip for new players, it's a lot more fun if you don't know anything about the game, also you need to manually save at a house or bed so build that first."

In flat mode it's actually not a bad game. A ""No"" recommendation would have been too harsh because it technically worked and I guess there was a story that I was supposed to investigate, but I'll just say I couldn't really get into the game. 

I do not recommend this as a VR game. Collecting and building and opening menus felt tedious and unnatural."

5376,"This game I think is a whole different experience if you are playing alone or with friends, but both are compelling to do and I have tried it out both ways. I was pleasantly surprised with this and played it when it was in its earlier days, but it seems much more polished now. Its well worth playing and if you can get this on sale I highly recommend giving it a go, especially if you enjoy survival horror games. 

The singleplayer experience is much more intense an experience and traversing cave systems by the flame of a lighter whilst padding of footsteps can be heard in the darkness is enough to break you out in a sweat. Playing with friends can still be scary, but its more hilarious at times when you watch your friend running about in the dark screaming and flailing their torch at the monsters lurking in the shadows. If you wanted the horror experience I would recommend going it solo, but if you are looking for a fun time with friends then this can be very amusing at times. The game itself plays really well, looks good and the combat is balanced enough that you feel like a normal person fighting for their life rather than some warrior of the wilds slaying monsters everywhere you roam....I mean you eventually can become that, but in the beginning if you get ganged up on you will soon be running for your life. Crafting takes a reasonable amount of time to make more complex structures, but if you have friends you can build all kinds of forts and defences against the waves of enemies that come for you when the sun goes down. The most surprising element to this game that I found was that it actually has a story (it used to not have one, it started with finding your son but the game was so early access it didn't actually have that made yet! That is how long I have played this game since!) I actually enjoyed uncovering the story and thought that it was a  much better telling of a survivor story on an island than bigger productions like Lost achieved. 

In summary, its got a good story and provides many hours of compelling gameplay as either a singleplayer horror experience or a fun multiplayer tale of survival on an island that has some unique monsters and challenges for you to sink your teeth into. If you like open world surival, crafting and horror elements then this is for you."
5377,"My son has been kidnapped by indigenous natives in a stinky forest, quickly racially motivated me after 20 minutes"
5378,Game makes me horny when i see the naked male cannibals
5379,"Scavenge Plane.  Loot luggage. Scavenge area. Use survival book.  Make fire. Make Shelter. Hunt.  What? Who is that?
Maybe he's friendly.  Die.  Become nutritious dinner.  Maybe I need some  walls?  Hmmm...
Great game!  Worth the price.  Whether you want to be a great fortress builder, its easy to use building system.  Perhaps you would rather explore or craft?  Maybe you just want to hack cannibals to bits,,,,  Its all there for the taking.
The game itself is not hard to play.  In some aspects it is pretty forgiving, others not so much.  I can get lost in this game, I hope you can too.  This game is easy to recommend.

5383,"I am a 60-year old father, probably one of the oldest people playing The forest. I am a single father to my son, who is now 17. My son recently started playing The forest. In less than a week, he had already played for over 20 hours. This was terrible for me because it was already hard enough for me to spend time with my son because he was always out with his friends or watching YouTube. So I decided to make a Steam account to play with my son. I started playing, but this was my first time playing a video game since the 90's, so I was quite lost. I asked my son for help, and together we spent hours playing The forest. I loved it as it was the best time I had spent with my son since my wife had died. Steam has ever since brought me and my son closer again, and now we actually spend time together outside the house as well. The forest reminded me that there's fun to be had in everything, and it has brought both me and my son many happy memories.

5391,Really Fun Game To Play With Friends And There Are No Bugs That I Know Of. A Very Fun Survival Experience!
5392,"What i love about this game is well.. the Cannibals themselves, I love how they interact with the player. They don't go head on like any npc, they would keep distance and attack at the right moment. They would also circle around you and attack you from behind. They run away if you kill their leader and wont attack you sometimes if you don't engage or if you just keep your distance. These mutants also climb and jump from tree to tree and would travel as a group belonging to different tribes. This is more than just a survival game as it has mutants, and you uncover their origins and the mysteries of the island while searching for your son. 

The game is beautiful, has day and night cycle, temperature, thirst, stamina, and hunger. There is a sanity level which i don't think has a purpose but i hope they update the game to give it purpose like don't Starve. As for building you can build anywhere and items don't break as they don't have durability. In terms of inventory items also don't slow you down and the inventory doesn't have a maximum cap it bases of the number of per item you can carry, unlike other games you can carry as much of an item so long as you have space like the same item filling an entire inventory but in The Forest you can carry all items but each item has a maximum cap like only 5 bottles.

Also lets talk about the tree cutting.. which is unique as a video game since you can actually see the tree being cut not just, hit hit hit then break into material, you have to circle a tree in order to cut it.. or at least hit it entirely since you might only cut the front so you have to move closer and hit the parts which are not cut."
5393,"so many skin walkers
fix the game im severely allergic to them"
5394,definitely would spend hours to play this with friend
5395,"its a pretty fun game so far, its really fun wit your friends and getting scared out of no where, i play on a microsoft surface pro 7 and it runs pretty well with medium graphics and on 1080p or lower. Sadly with 1080p i only get around 30fps but if its lower i get more. if you dont have a laptop or pc with a graphics card like me then stay in 1080p and dont go lower than 720p or it will look a bit weird"
5396,i just finished build a house and big naked hippo running with two leg rammed my house to shreds. This game is freaking awesome
5397,"Having played survival games such as Stranded Deep, The Long Dark, Subnautica, and BreathEdge, I thought that I'd enjoy one of the top rated survival games on Steam. I came into it very excited until around 6 hours in when I started to lose interest. The majority of your time will be spend in caves where you can barely see a foot in front of you at all times. I really wanted to like this game especially since Sons of The Forest is coming out this year; however, it was so hard to love it because everything felt way too repetitive. Base building is basically worthless since all you really need is a simple leaf tent to save your game. Next, the combat system is just utterly not good in the sense that all you need to do is to swing until they're down. Plus this swinging reuses the same animation over and over for pretty much every weapon (except the flintlock pistol and bows). Then comes food and water (or thirst). Food can be hard to come by and it spoils which is a nice touch but when it comes to thirst, you will find an abundance of soda which really negates the difficulty in finding clean liquids to quench your thirst. Lastly, the A.I. is just dumb.

TL;DR: I rate it a 6/10, the graphics are nice, you don't need a fast PC, the story is interesting, yet the gameplay and exploration is lacking."

5406,"I have not played single player, but played through on multiplayer and had a fun experience. There are some bugs and I had achievements that didn't unlock even though I did them (some unlocked randomly, or later on). But overall, it was a fun game to play with a team, especially if you aren't into scary games on your own. I don't play horror games, but because of the multiplayer option, I was able to play through with friends and experience a different type of game and story and I really enjoyed that. The story was well done and interesting, you are faced with emotional choices, there are things that make you laugh and things that make you feel uncomfortable/uneasy, and of course you run into things that make you jump.

5430,"I wanted to like this game, it's got quite a bit of what it takes to make a great survival crafting game, for sure. However... 

Item collection is jank. You can only carry small amounts of most things, even with the 'bag' upgrades. If they were trying to go for some form of realism with this game, I wouldn't bat an eye. However when you're fighting against giant mutant cannibal monsters in various colors, that rather goes out the window.

Crafting is basic and gets old fast. You ARE allowed 'custom' builds for houses, but in the end the expense of it isn't worth the effort. Crafting for weapons is few, crafting for random necessities like armor, food, etc. is also sparce (and many times, extremely obnoxious as you have to chase down and somehow hit everything that moves to get it). You need a LOT of supplies for singular things, and I mean a LOT. So plan out those multiple trips and LONG walks.

Plan to deal with a lot of issues with your character, from parasitic water (because good luck finding the pot to pan for the water to slap on the fire to boil the water to drink- and did I mention you can only get water from certain sources, and you need the water skin to pick up the water from the pot to drink?) To having to eat constantly (which isn't too horrendous, but any food other than the snack bars expires fast). Health (your HP bar) is an absolute pain to replenish, as only certain things will help you.

My absolute biggest beef with this game came in the difficulty level. Okay. I like a good hard survival game, for sure. But straight-up, when you throw me into a BRAND NEW GAME at the VERY START with NO tutorial-- and I immediately get attacked by a group of six to twelve cannibals at once? That's poor game design. And this didn't happen only once. i died, restarted, and this happened to me four more times. I nearly quit right then and there.

But I pushed on long enough to try and get a strong feel for this game. And let me tell you, I'm sorely freaking disappointed."

5447,"First ill start with the things I like, I love the wide open world! I cant get bored of walking through the white snowy mountains to dimly lit caves. The Lighting and shadows are just so pretty, I always find my self on boats sailing across the ocean, and all little details. Like when you go to the limits of the map, you pull out a picture of Timmy to remind the player what they're supposed to do. Probably The most immersive survival game's I've ever played. I have hundreds of hours of game time and I've enjoyed every last second, from the laughs, to the cry's. but they're some bugs that either were annoying or weird, For example. an armsy once hit me a single time with full creepy armor and I died. and once I was looking for the blueprints, and found a dead cannabal on the island.

Out of this experiences I would totally recomend it to people who are in to survival games

I literally was terrified when i first discovered the caves. going into this game blind is a must to get the true experience. The only downside is that creating a home is basically pointless, we spent hours creating a huge unique house that was never used. But thats not a real issue, the game is a great co op experience and i highly recommend it.

I totally love this game. I spend a lot of hours into it and i played both endings. The story is awesome and the gameplay feels really great too.

IN THIS Game you can get lost VERY quickly and easily (especially in caves) aswell as the danger of ""creatures."" You must be actively doing something or making something to protect and save yourself, aswell as animals that can kill you, if you don't want to be constantly moving, building, and fighting. I don't recommend but other damn that it's a very nice game and chill it you put it on max detail.

5516,"The Forest is pretty good. 7/10

I got about 80 hours of game play before I was ready to rush to the end and move on.
The game is complete but it feels like there's not much to do once you build a base - besides hunting for story items.
Most of my time in game was spent hauling logs, sticks, and rocks to build a base.
The base building is slow and clunky, but offers unique customization options to build in trees, cliffs, and over water.
The enemies have interesting AI. Their hostility is determined by your actions.
The graphics are decent in 2022, but not special.

I'm hoping the 2nd edition to this game will have more to do, more base building options, and more focus on replay-ability.
This edition is fine for the price, but buy it on sale if you can."

5627,It's fun and cool and not so hard but it sure is scary.
5628,Very good even better with friends.
5629,"This game has it's merits and flaws. The graphics are pretty good, the VR feel is good. But it's severely lacking substance. I'm playing on Hard survival, just not feeling it. I'm glad it was only 20 dollars. Because I would have had serious issues if they try to charge more than that with the serious lack of content."
5630,cannibals look hot it get me hard they hot they fuck me i fuvk them anal
5631,fun game especially with friends highly recommend it just done playing raft
5632,aggressive naked men chased me through the forest and a weird spider girl tried to stick her leg down my throat soooooo pretty fun (:
5633,"kill cannibals, eat them and collect their bones and make some weapons with it and killed those cannibals again. Fun to play with friends."
5634,"Played this game for 2 days straight now, got jumpscared a shit ton of times. But i'd recommend it. (:"
5635,Mabie wait for the new forest mite be mutch beter but still a good game very scary
5636,add sex
5637,:)
5638,Game Good
5639,"fuck you
"
5640,Mushrooms are fun
5641,"This game has very good graphics, and the survival situation seems so real, Cant wait for the new one"
5642,"I don't enjoy this game
Multiple reasons:
1 ridiculous hitbox and melee attack are stupid and weird, feels like punching a piece of cotton. Dissecting and eating corpses are kinda interesting but somehow....
2 food and water. right now my understanding is that you have to spend your entire day hunting deers squirrels, turtles and other animals to prevent your ""stomach"" from hurting you, and you have to spend a lot of time looking for water, and that makes up my everyday.
3 there is NO in-game guide, the only thing they could tell you is to make a little house and light up a little campfire and stay alive. I don't wanna spend hours watching youtube videos and searching the wikis to learn how to play this game
4 the biggest reason is that i don't see the interesting parts of this game, on the other words I don't know how is this game fun and attractive. all i did  was to looking for water and foods, fight with cannibals and thinking about life. i know there is a storyline to follow but i don't find it fun from the videos
The concept and ideas in this game is incredible, and i really love it. However this game does need some improvements, cuz right now it looks like a half-finished game got released for no reason."
5643,yes
5644,30 minutes to god
5645,gg
5646,this game dope but scary
5647,"Great horror environment which makes this game feel more complete than a regular survival game. Not a whole lot of things to do, but replayable due to the horror elements."
5648,"It's one of my all-time favorites and the only game to every trigger my fight or flight response so much that I could physically feel the adrenaline being dumped into my bloodstream (even on a second playthrough when I know what to expect). Don't read anything about the lore or watch any videos, just dive right in, experience the world, and see what it's going to throw at you. This game is a wild ride, and the sequel can't come soon enough."

5663,"I am a 44 yo father, probably one of the oldest people playing this game. I am a single farther to my Son, who is 12 now. My son got this game for Christmas from his uncle, so we installed it on his computer and he started playing. By the end of the week he had 24 hours on this game. This was horrible for me, as it was already hard for me to find ways to spend time with my son, as he is always out with his friends or just, watching YouTube. So i decided to make a Steam account and get this game to see if I could maybe play alongside him. loaded into the game, made my character and world and started playing but I was stuck on what you where supposed to do. I asked my Son for help and he hosted a game for me to join. loved it as it was the best time had spent with my Son since my wife had died. This game has ever since brought me and my son closer again and now we actually spend time together outside the house together as well. This game reminded me that there's fun to be had in everything, and it has brought both me and my Son many happy memories."
5664,xd
5665,forest moment
5666,"Its a neat game when you first start playing it but the flaws start showing up very quickly. The building is probably the worst I've ever played in a survival game. To build a medium sized square house you'll be chopping down trees for several hours. God help you if you make a mistake somewhere and need to rebuild it because you don't get any of your resources back. Other than just surviving in the forest the only other thing to do to progress the story is to explore several caves that all look the same. The first few you get into are cool - dark, spooky, and maze like. Then you see the caves again. And again. And again. I finally gave up once I got to the bottom of the giant sinkhole - the coolest looking thing I had found at that point - and was rewarded with a weapon that was worse than the one I was using.

Overall the game has some good ideas. The atmosphere is done exceedingly well, hunting and surviving is fun, but there really isn't any depth to anything else in the game."

5722,good
5723,"I really enjoyed this game and its hard to find anything negative about it.
From the beginning you are not forced into a 'path', the game just indicates to you what could be your next steps/missions which i usually really like  - for example like in Skyrim. 
I had a lot of fun exploring the forest and finding out step by step how everything works. 
For your first try i would recommend to play it on 'normal' difficulty, cuz this is actually already pretty challenging if you are going to play it blind.
The survival aspects, crafting, graphics, atmosphere, story (ending)... everything is really great and especially the AI is amazing!

Highly recommended!"

What I really like is the game is full of bug just like in the outdoors, not insect bugs just stuff the Dev/s didnt fix or overlooked that could have improved the game. Just about as annoying as real life bugs too."

Its like Rust but single player and not toxic and grindy.
The Forest is one one the hardest and most balanced survival games I have ever played, 7days to die, rust, emperion galactic survival, and every other famous or nitche survival horror game. This just feels so right to play and the multiplayer is great too."

5761,In my opinion this game is not for me it just really was that fun to me. It looks fun when you watch others play it or have friends but if you are playing solo i won't really suggest it. There is really not much explained to you which isn't necessarily bad but in this case the game just feels a little empty. And there is a few bugs but I am willing to excuse them since they aren't game breaking. ( I played only roughly an hour and a half before I requested a refund cause I could tell I was not gonna like the game.) If i were to buy it I would wait for a sale and get it with friends that is a good way to make sure you enjoy the game.
5762,yes

5771,"i like that the game basically tells you to suck a lemon and figure everything out for yourself. besides that, its a very 2006 kind of game. in 4 hours i covered a quarter of the surface and killed some alligators, massacred a village and got stepped on by some fatty. as for story progression, you get to play the travelling salesman problem. you want a map? die. want to go diving? get a mask. want to use said mask? get the air cans. basically if you want to complete the story, you need to memorise where stuff is and of course, find the stuff in the first place. some of which you cant find without certain stuff. 
couldn't harvest fire-weed or light Molotov's and knowing id have to endure memorising a map, most of which looks the same, i figured this isn't it.

This was horrible for me, as it was already hard for me to find ways to spend time with my son, as he is always out with his friends or just, watching YouTube. So i decided to make a Steam account and get this game to see if I could maybe play alongside him. loaded into the game, made my character and world and started playing but I was stuck on what you where supposed to do. I asked my Son for help and he hosted a game for me to join. loved it as it was the best time had spent with my Son since my wife had died. This game has ever since brought me and my son closer again and now we actually spend time together outside the house together as well. This game reminded me that there's fun to be had in everything, and it has brought both me and my Son many happy memories"
5788,"i got a girlfrinds playing this 
"

"
5804,Best game ever! So much fun co-op or solo.
5805,"I shat myself multiple times when encountering the cannibal species, but it did not prepare me for the most horrendous experience I was about to wittness with my own eyes. It is safe to say that my soul had successfully left my body after the encounter with the arm monster in a pitchblack cafe. Otherwise nice game."
5806,game so good
5807,i ate a man
5808,very good game
5809,I get to collect heads. Especially baby heads.
5810, really enjoyable.takes a little pratice

10/10 though would recommend"
5812,good!
5813,.
5814,"good game if you like horror and survival games
"
5815,Combat is very simplistic and has little to it. The game expects you to be able to find tiny caves all over the map that looks the same. Then when you enter a cave its made with absolutely no structure allowing you to get lost very quickly. The only way to combat this is to have a tab with youtube open 24/7. Later on when harder enemies appear the melee weapons one grows used to are immediately almost useless and you are forced to just only throw explosives at enemies. There is no actual difficulty to this game with the developers idea of difficulty being to add more enemies. The game's overall gameplay loop isn't that fun with you being forced to be stuck in a cave for a lot of your time and since the food expires so quickly you are near starving for all of your playtime in caves.
5816,"Admittedly, this game had one of the more interesting and compelling atmospheres out of the handful of games I've played recently- and it's a good concept, truly!! But that can't excuse the lackluster AI programming, downright terrible layout and map design, bland sound design, etc. Every cave in this game looks the exact same; and often the items needed to progress are in the weirdest spots, to the point if you miss a single turn, you can waste upwards of an hour. Great concept: terrible execution."
5817,siuuu
5818,"yes baby

5822,Very Good!!!
5823,"If your parents keep bothering you by asking ""Why youre always sitting infront of that damn computer ?"" then this game can answer that question once and for all.

Also works against any console players too..console players can suck on pineapple."
5824,"Fun game. The cannibals are pretty scary. Overall, 8/10."

5832,Good game to play with others. or alone but alot to cover.
5833,"You can cut feet off and eat them.
Canibalism/10"
5834,Great game with great mechanics
5835,there is a forest
5836,"fun game, despite all the bugs and weird physics lmao"
5837,I can't kill a bunni
5838,if you want the constant urge of something staring at you while you try to find your son then maybe get this game in other words you aren't alone
5839,"Amazing game. The forest is something that is suitable for all players, it delivers an immensive story, hours of gameplay (days) and presents its self as a horror-like survival game which personally is goldmine for any game i thoroughly enjoyed this game both single player and multiplayer and even has the vr feature which i havent yet tried"
5840,not very fun. very laggy. boreing.
5841,i love the scary forest
5842,good
5843,ENJOYING IT
5844,i screamdwe
5845,"Lots of fun with friends! Fun survival, you really have to work together to make things and kill the enemies. Challenges at every corner, has the creep factor and makes you be resourceful."
5846,simple. i like survival
5847,fun to play with friends
5848,This game wild bruv
5849,fun friend or solo survival game
5850,hrs of fun
5851,saw cannibal boobs
5852,"It's been like 4 years. Could've added more content by now, the game barely has a campaign, it's just cave simulator. Hopefully the sequel is better and updated more frequently."
5853,All I see are trees.
5854,i lost my whole career to get a good career on this game
5855,"Go check out my youtube channel to see play through. ""B-RICE"""
5856,:)
5857,beat the shit out of cancer patients i very much do recommend
5858,MOUNTAIN
5859,It ok
5860,"I ate a cannibal, doesn't that makes me a cannibal too?"
5861,is good
5862,yes
5863,"Good game, specially multiplayer version."
5864,great game but that one zipline that makes you slip and fall is pretty annoying. apart from that loved the entire playthrough.
5865,"My friend got scared of a singular bat 

!0/10"
5866,Naked men chasing me is scary.
5867,This game is still fun. Hope some people give it a try again after not being able to play it on a pc that cant handle it and when they get a pc to play it
5868,very fun with friends :D very boring without friends D:
5869,"(get on sale) 
Fun and interesting, but unfinished and buggy (especially in multiplayer). Also can feel like there's too much grinding to build if you want a somewhat big house with actual protection"
5870,"The most intense jump scares I've ever had playing this game were not from naked men or mutants, but cave bats. 10/10"
5871,chi con amigos
5872,got molested
5873,"After I played 10 hours in a server with my friend and we gathered every single item in the game, the game glitched and I fell under the ground and everything got lost."
5874,very game eat people
5875,
5876,"Super fun and engaging for the first time you play but once you complete the game and know what each cave has in it and where to find the best loot, it's then boring. If there was a way to RNG the caves and loot then it would fix this issue, otherwise it's not a game you want to replay over and over. Still recommend, if looking for a fun survival game to play with a story included."
5877,"very unique and creative, cant wait to play the next one!"
5878,"Very good game
I just don't like the canibals with titties
Women belong to the kitchen not to the forests"
5879,"there might be bad people in this game,., does the robot?!?!?!?@"
5880,I love the females.
5881,"Fun game, can't wait for sons of the forest to come out."
5882,vr is really buggy and hard but on pc its like the best game ive played rn
5883,"Very fun, realistic and scary, would recommend 10/10"
5884,"Great Game
"
5885,Very epic stuff pretty cool to build like fortresses n stuff
5886,10/10 would recommend

5899,veri gud
5900,.
5901,"Great game, highly recommended. More fun to play with a friend but very scary to play on your own. 
The sound effects of nature as well as the cannibals really adds to the game. Again, would definitely recommend."
5902,one of the games of all time
5903,I LOVE IT
5904,"Fun , scary and exciting bt only with friends in my opinion!!

(ÔΩûÔø£‚ñΩÔø£)ÔΩû"
5905,if i had friends
5906,"     The Forest is a good game. It looks very nice even on very low graphics quality, also really love the building system. The only thing that I found hard was the aiming system, it took me a while to really grasp what was going on."
5907,"Finished the game in coop after 40 hours (still got some caves and things to explore) but holy moly

This game is my first survival game but it might just be my favorite forever or until the sequel arrives, the nature of enemies, the atmosphere, .. you don't know what 'darkness' is until you play this game and it becomes night, it really shows how other games don't try enough.

Never a moment I felt without tension, anxiety or fear, especially in the caves, it was an experience that I needed several breaks from at times but pushed on cause you wish to uncover what happened here.

In my playthrough I had pretty much no bugs so that was nice, I feel like this game is worth it completely at full price, even at higher price and I'll be getting Sons of the forest on release if it is even remotely positive."
5908,me eat cannibals
5909,"It's a GREAT game with lots of funs specially if you play with your friends.
The AI in this game is something else they're so sophisticated.
I really wish Son of the Forest will be just as good if not better than this.

Keep up the good work Endnight Games :D."
5910,Honestly one of the best games I've played. I can go back and play it every couple of months and still have as much fun as i did the first time i played it. I can't wait for the 2nd one. 10/10

5928,This game wow its a work of art the story is great and you have so much fun but watch out their is always something trying to kill you well that's what it felt like for me i would tell you to get this game but its your choice cant wait for the second game coming this October

5930,"I felt my balls drop when I play this game, I don‚Äôt have balls."
5931,"Fun survival horror discovery game with fighting and building involved. Sci-fi story line and co-op available too! Graphics are fantastic (this depends on your GPU, monitor, settings etc though). Blood and nudity are a part of this game (cannibals are naked/partially dressed) so if that's something you're concerned with you may want to play this when you can do NSFW type things."
5932,"Yeah, I'd have to say this game is a pretty good survival game. It combines elements of realistic survival and horror with cannibalistic enemies. Also has a beautiful map."
5933,fuckiun vbesrt
5934,yers
5935,This game is awesome and makes you scream like a little girl sometimes!
5936,its an awesome game and very fun to play with friends I recommend
5937,not bad
5938,"fun to build, although the cannibals can be annoying that's quite literally their purpose so they do their job"
5939,The forest is a lovely romp though a paradise island. Please ignore any comments about cannibals. They most certainly do not exist in this game. They will not destroy you.
5940,"This game is excellent. It has managed to achieve the survival horror combination with gameplay that is actually good. I think this game has successfully done what Rust, 7 Days to Die, and even Hand Simulator Survival have all sought to do but failed.

This was on my wishlist for years before I finally decided to buy it, and man I wish I had bought it sooner."

5947,"üå≤Played 100 Days of Horrifying Beauty in VR (Virtual Reality)üå≤

This game is absolutely amazing by itself
Add in VR and it's quite literally one of the best VR survival games offering an insane level of immersion.

For those struggling with VR controls:
https://youtu.be/fQOaR23EwVY

For wanting to see what 100 Days was like all inside Virtual Reality (roughly 70 hours of gameplay)
https://youtu.be/qwd2i_-J0fc

I sure hope Endnight adds VR support to Sons of the Forest!"

5955,The best co-op survival game I have ever played.
5956,"I like this game.
it is pleasingly brutal"
5957,This game is awesome minus the fact i have no one to play with.
5958,"Game is great. Perfectly fun and like you can have VR and normal PC play

Monsters are awesome as is the building, hunger and thirst mechanic

Biggest issue I have with this game is that no matter where you save, you spawn back at the plane. I don‚Äôt mind that you have to go find your things again but the fact that you lose your save place is really really a pain"
5959,loved it
5960,"Highly recommend to others. I enjoy the game with multiple players. 
Things that can use improvement: 
1. Add a water pouch that has a few sips of water. Looking for water is annoying. 
2. Add where it takes longer for monsters and enemies to destroy you structures and walls, enemy structure damage is insane, unrealistic, and annoying. 
3. Add a variant of enemies that are more rare and that rarely appear. 
4. Add a major large but rare humanoid monster that is rarely seen and maybe destroys surrounding trees. 
5. Maybe fill empty space in the world with more items.
6. Maybe add a sling to throw rocks with."

First thing i was asking myself was if my pc was gonna have the heat off elons new rocket engine when i play this game in VR.
Surprsingly, no.
Good FPS Good Graphics
And honestly the game is just broken in vr, the time it takes for you to mine a tree in non vr is incredible, it takes stamania and everything.
In VR tho you just quickly do the Beat Saber on them and it doesnt even take stamania.
Purely wonderful"

5988,"My review doesn't have anything to do with the game itself. I've played it in the past, it was fun overall, and I moved on.

=======================================================================

The main reason I'm reviewing the game now and giving it a negative score has nothing to do with the game, but I am for a reason that will affect every Unity developer going forward. Unity is merging/partnering with ironSource, a company with an utterly terrible track record and a company who has actively created malware installers disguised as legit software for PC that backdoor installs adware, malware, etc.

Unity is making this ""business move"" because their s##tbag CEO (former EA, because of course...) wants to introduce built-in data tracking and monetization tools into all games that use the Unity engine, so that developers can use these tools to track players and enable them to gain a deep understanding of our psychology and effectively use that to influence us even harder to spend on micro-transactions. These practices are predatory and only growing more  and more by the day. We as consumers have to fight against the tide in any way we can.

I refuse to play/buy/install any Unity games going forward if this is the way they intend move forward. I'm sorry to the developer, but there's not much else we can really do to spread awareness and cause enough backlash. Developers are the ones who use engine products, they have more sway than anyone else to go against Unity right now. Please speak up."

6032,"It's surprisingly really in depth! I originally thought it was just a horror survival game, but it goes so much deeper than that. The lore you piece together by exploring campsites, caves and other structures are very detailed. There's a lot to see and do, and the world is large enough that we accidentally completed it before seeing it all. There are some truly unique mechanics. The endgame was also unexpected! All I wish is that the ending cutscenes were shared when in co-op. My partner got to see everything and it didn't end up making too much sense to me because of it. I would highly recommend if you enjoy horror, survival and exploration!"
6033,"very fun survival game, its both challenging and enjoyable. This is a great, one of a kind game that you should try out."
6034,"I highly recommend for anyone to play this game, I was first recommended this game by friend but ever since  I have been playing alot. The story is well written and it's really fun to play with friends not to mention the very unique building system. I really enjoyed the challenge trying to survive the mutants and the somewhat convincing realism."
6035,"The Protagonists of The Forest and Fallout 4: a dissertation on excellence (or lack thereof) in character writing and motivation.


Fallout 4's Nathan:
- is named Nathan (100% chance of being a fan of tom macdonald)
- low paid soldier that commits war crimes and oppresses marginalized groups in other countries to make other people rich
- unoriginal story of man with deceased wife on a quest for vengeance to save patriarchal lineage (bechdel test? hello?)
- despite living in the future he cannot make cool tree houses
- needs a bunch of alt right fascist MilSim LARPers to fly him around
- requires nuclear weaponry to fend off rats and flies
- makes a cringe gang with civil war reenactors purely to impose authoritarian views on the population
- needs permission from land barons to build his shoddy, rusty, and tetanus-laden OSHA hazard/eye sore ""structures"" in areas with zoning laws and HOA fees/regulation
- does not sacrifice children to eldritch gods and/or aliens
- wastes valuable time solving other people's problems to find son because he's incompetent
+ has a dog

The Forest's Eric LeBlanc:
+ is named Eric LeBlanc (a proud name reminiscent of beloved icon Matthew LeBlanc, star of the documentary ""the friends: a realistic portrayal of life in the big apple"")
+ high paying career as an actor beloved by millions in a respected liberal arts field
+ very progressive story of man with deceased wife going on a quest for justice to save son (just like breath-taking keanu as johnathan wick)
+ can make cool tree houses
+ makes his own glider to fly around
+ can demolish wave after wave of enemies utilizing only his fists, rocks, and sticks with ease
+ lone wolf sigma male that needs no one else to survive
+ can build a beautiful home anywhere on the island with his own two hands without HOA violations
+ willing to ritually sacrifice children to eldritch god and/or aliens to save his son
+ kills a sea turtle and slides on its shell down into a sinkhole to save son mere moments after losing him
- does not have a dog"

6043,"Cheiraram 3 pacote de sab√£o em p√≥ e criaram o game. S√≥ consegui zerar com cheat porque bugo tudo, fora isso da pra rir no multiplayer"
6044,ooga booga people coming to jump you with clubs
6045,funky 8 legged man
6046,"PROS:
Very fun and tense will keep you on edge and first 8 days will be terrifying as you discover more.
Satisfying chopping of trees.
Various difficulties if you don't like hardcore games.
Multiplayer that's solid and not choppy or laggy.
Will say the story is pretty good but haven't finished it myself. I hear its a pick the ending type.
Mobs aren't too hard to deal with, if it's your first game ever will be tough but with skills from other survival games like Conan or Minecraft, this one is really easy to pick up and play.
Has an ingame version of voice chat you cant use which helps.
CONS:
Personally, its way more fun with at least a friend or more, otherwise wouldnt be fun solo with the process of making a base
No real way to speed up grinds other than getting bigger pouches for smaller items.
If you wan't a big cool lookin base it will take a long time chopping trees especially solo.
Certain things a little buggy like the roof ends dont fill in, certain trees just don't chop, and mobs will get stuck on little rocks and stuff when coming at you.
Building very different from other games which I like to see, however wonky at times.
Some days feel like they are filled with constant enemy attackss where you are just staving them off and can't get any of the things you want done, done.

Personally would give it a 9/10 for what it is. Well made, good story, good animations,little bit wonky with some things but for a game of its size and price it goes really well. Looking forward to the next game ""Sons of the Forest"" coming out soon"
6047,"My sister and I spent a lot of time playing and beating this game together when I was at college and we were apart from one another. I really enjoyed playing it with her and if you have fun playing survival games, I think you'll enjoy this game! Definitely a lot of grinding at times if you want to build structures and need to get the materials for them, but definitely an enjoyable experience if you like survival games!"

6073,"If you're looking for a review on this game you've come to the wrong place, but if you're looking for an outstanding pie recipe you've come to the right place.

Ingredients:

1. 6 tablespoons unsalted butter
2. 1/2 cup white sugar
3. 1/2 cup brown sugar
4. 1/4 cup water
5. 1/4 teaspoon cinnamon
6. 1 pinch salt
7. 5 apples - peeled, cored and sliced
8. 1 pastry for double-crust pie

Directions:

1. Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C).
2. Combine butter, white sugar, brown sugar, water, cinnamon, and salt in a saucepan over medium heat. Bring to a boil, remove from heat and set aside.
3. Roll out half the pastry to fit a 9-inch pie plate. Place bottom crust in pie plate; pour in apple slices.
4. Roll out top crust into a 10-inch circle. Cut into 8 (1-inch) wide strips with a sharp paring knife or pastry wheel. Weave the pastry strips, one at a time, into a lattice pattern. Fold the ends of the lattice strips under the edge of the bottom crust and crimp to seal.
5. Pour butter-sugar mixture over top of pie, coating the lattice, and allowing any remaining sauce to drizzle through the crust.
6. Bake in the preheated oven for 15 minutes. Reduce heat to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C), and bake until the crust is golden brown, the caramel on the top crust is set, and the apple filling is bubbling, 35 to 40 more minutes. Allow to cool completely before slicing."

6079,"This game is great if you love the freedom of an open world without the RPG aspect, and especially if you like to build bases. The freedom to build is very satisfying and the touch of horror brought on by the cannibalistic humans, mutants and monsters is fantastic."
6080,Best story game created

6163,"For a game made in 2014, i'm very impressed! The graphics and gameplay are just amazing!"
6164,"they wanna eat me, but I wanna eat them too."
6165,"Honestly felt incomplete with the amount of jank in the game. The lights suck, especially the flashlight. Repeated playthroughs of this game aren't fun as there is no randomization to locations so you know what's in them 100% of the time, thus making it a rush to grab modern axe, katana, keycard, and modern bow. There's no point in any exploration if you know the game already.

Genuinely feels abandoned by it's creators the second it got to 1.0 state, with minor fixes since then but the fact of the amount of glitches I've ran into in especially the barely tacked on MP is horrendous.
If you die in MP more than once, you will start in the plane with little HP, little to no stamina and nothing. You then need to get back to your gear with those stats or avoid running into cannibals. It's really tedious and overly punishing of a system."
6166,"my biggest mistake was having minecraft like expectations. had fun nonetheless, definitely worth its price"

Fun game, good graphics, good-enough combat, but the survival aspects of the game are really what you play for. Some of the best base building systems I've ever seen in a game somehow being fun, expressive, AND semi-realistic at the same time as offering a varied amount of unique ideas fitting with the games Stranded-On-An-Island aesthetic.
Definitely recommend, stoked for the sequel."

6243,"This game took thirteen hours of my life and my sanity that I cant get back. The first two hours? Cool. Fun. The last hour? Also cool and fun. The middle 9 hours? Torture. 
The mechanics are busted and make no sense, the balancing is weird, and the story honestly couldve been done much better. My friends and I played together and just lamented about how bored we were. I dont ever leave reviews on games, but this warranted one.
Also, fuck timmy."
6244,This game is SO BORING. The first 2 hours? Bangers. The final hour-ish? Alright. The rest? Peepee. Do not buy this game. It has very few redeeming qualities.
6245,love playing with the bros on the awesome horror survival game.
6246,"Don't even buy this game on sale, they are making another and haven't even finished this one. 

The story is barely a concept. It plays out like a trying deep hardcore fanfiction that has no real satisfying ending. The pacing is terrible. The choice in the end has no real impact. 

The game finds a way to be buggy in most cases where bugs don't even seem possible yet it finds a way. I've seen more glitches in my few hours of playtime than I have every game combined. 

The game isn't scary or intense. The most impact it has is when bats fly at you in the caves. The AI isn't scary and none of the designs are really that creepy. 

The game has so many ideas and executes none of them in a compelling or interesting way.

Timmy isn't even a cute kid."
6247,this game is best to play with friends

6267,"Really good survival game spilled with a huge map, crafting, horror and an okay story. I played with the Early Access version back when it first launched and I already liked it. The game is now finished, has a proper story and you can play trough it without any issues. Not gonna lie, when I started playing the game I got addicted to it so much, that I only put it down when I got all the Achievements, and finished the story itself. Since then, I never really touched it. So I completed it on normal and decided to give it another try on Hard difficulty with my dudes. It's a little bit hard for them, because they just started playing it and never knew anything about the game, but they're at least enjoying it. I don't exactly know if I would complete this game alone once again, it's more fun and faster with other players.

Congratulations if you got this far. Either you read the whole thing or just came down here to, you know, maybe give me an award. JK. <3"
6268,Really enjoying this survival game. Some of the mechanics are a little buggy or could use some refinement but in all this is awesome! Multi player is fun as well. Worth picking it up!

6299,"this game is very close to being perfect. Everything is perfect from graphics to crafting systems. Example to craft an axe instead of only needing a stick and a rock you'd need a stick, rock and rope. Crafting items can also be upgraded into lasting longer or just be better and stronger as a whole. For this game genre everything is perfect apart from 1 or 2 main things. The adventure aspect. I only have 7 hours on this game but I've noticed some of the clues found have no explanation and if there is you'd only get it at the very end of the game. Doesn't matter too much but the biggest issue that isn't even that big of a deal is the caves. The story is that your plane crashes, kid gets taken by tall naked men and you need to search for little Timmy, you explore in caves and kill the naked men you see before they kill you first. The issue is some caves look almost exactly the same and there's nothing special about them really, Caves consist up of around 6 main things. Darkness, rock, rope, water, loot and gore. (gore being bodies, guts and the naked men) Caves always have these 6 things and nothing else to them which can make it very underwhelming. Some areas also lead to places you've been before. The game is also very unclear on what you need to do and you honestly can't complete the game without google. You need to go in caves in a certain order. Some caves have doors that need a key card that you can find in cave 1, but if you don't know that then you'll be spending about 5-10 hours exploring landscapes and caves to look for this key card or other items needed to explore and complete the game. With that aside that's mainly the only flaw in this game. A tiny bit pricey for the game but not dramatically overpriced I'd probably pay a max of ¬£10.50 for it so only ¬£5 extra needed which doesn't hurt anyone really if you're going to even have a steam account. The amount of deals steam does this game is 100% worth it and recommend it to anyone. Its single player and multiplayer and you can make private servers too so it's perfect to play by yourself or with friends also. You could also make friends on this game, I personally haven't because i only play it with my cousin but its defiantly worth the money."

6327,"What could be a great game is unfortunately plagued by a variety of bugs that will crash your game or kick you to the start menu without warning, an issue especially on Multiplayer that will wipe hours of progress from you or just straight up delete your character. The devs unfortunately chose to develop a sequel instead of actually bringing their first game to a stable release."

6333,"I am a 54 yo father, probably one of the oldest people playing this game. I am a single father to my Son, who is 14 now. My son got this game for Christmas in 2021 from his uncle, so we installed it on his computer and he started playing. By the end of the week he had 40 hours on this game. This was horrible for me, as it was already hard for me to find ways to spend time with my son, as he is always out with his friends or just watching Faide montages on YouTube. So i decided to make a Steam account and get this game to see if I could maybe play alongside him. I loaded into the game, picked my character and world and started playing but I was stuck on what you where supposed to do. I asked my Son for help and he hosted a game for me to join. I loved it as it was the best time I had spent with my son since my wife had died. This game has ever since brought me and my son closer again and now we actually spend time together outside the house together as well. This game reminded me that there's fun to be had in everything, and it has brought both me and my Son many happy memories.

wait a minute. something aint right.
WTF i have became 54 father . well i aint complaining"
6334,it a very addictive game. it will get boring after you did everything the game have to offer

6357,good
6358,love this game
6359,"i love beating,stabbing,molesting,lighting on fire cannibalistic women"
6360,no
6361,"I don't watch horror movies. I don't like scary games. But that didn't stop me from playing and beating the Forest with my friends. After purchasing the game on sale for $5, my expectations were low. I'm happy to say I am utterly impressed at the scope of this game. The map was larger than I thought and had an even more expansive underground cave system. There are story item collectibles everywhere. There is a variety of mutant and cannibal designs and movesets. Various weapons to find and use. After getting over the initial tedium of farming for resources, this game becomes a fun survival ride that you can continue for as long as you want, sometimes so long that you forget your main objective. Once you get there, the end-game is a surprise, and the actual game ending was a very satisfying experience. Music is limited in this game, but the music you do hear feels very intentional and impactful. 

My main complaint about this game is that I would randomly get booted off of my friend's server once during each play session (usually after 45mins-1hr of playing), and if we hadn't saved in a while we would lose progress, which was really frustrating. We had to get used to periodically building shelters to save. Another thing is that the controls were wonky playing with a controller and it was a little hard to get used to the controls, camera, and combat. I feel like I never 100% got the hang of aiming and wielding each weapon. The camera movement would hurt my eyes after a 2-hour session, even after adjusting my settings. 

Nonetheless, I can see my friends and I continuing to hop on the Forest to build and mess around with cannibals as we anticipate the release of the Sons of the Forest. Even for the regular price of $19.99, I recommend this game if you are looking for a fun single or multiplayer survival game."
6362,I FUCKING LOVE THIS GAME!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
6363,i hate it

6376,great spooky survival game!
6377,"Aside from the achievements being completely messed up (sorry, I'm bitter about those things) I'd say this is a good game. There were a few glitches along the way but overall it kept my friend and me on edge and terrified most of the time. The discovery and exploration you're forced to undergo is well implemented. You very much feel like you're trying to just survive and you never quite feel safe. If you like having the odds stacked against you and constantly being afraid of the dark then this game is probably for you."
6378,"i played for 16 hours I died and never played again

6379,"There has never been a game that has made this tense. It is possibly the scariest horror game I've ever played. Out of the 2 I've ever played. (including this one.)

6397,The Forest to me is as good as the group you are playing it with on Discord. It doesn't seem like a great solo experience but when you have some people in group chat and you're trying not to get eaten by cannibals it's a blast. Highly reccommend as a good mess-around co-op game.
6398,The fact that you can choose how you want to survive is fun. Canabalism? Sure! Vegetarianism? Sure!

6407,good
6408,you can make cannibals sing songs for you
6409,"said hell no to saving the kid, ended up gathering several cannibal bodies for no reason.
game good."
6410,"A fantastic survival game.  Enough in the game to keep you challenged, even more so when the cannibals and mutants come calling.  From the very first minute after crashing onto the island you feel the urgency to find food and liquid to feed your body.  Building some sort of defence and shelter is what you need to focus on from the onset.  Looting what you can find from the crash site is also a must, and some very helpful items can be found to help you stay alive long enough for the days and nights ahead.

Personally I have not delved much into the story line, just stumbling over and finding the items through exploration.  Night time makes the hair stand up on the back of your neck when the uninvited guests come calling and wailing.

Crafting and building is well thought out and put together.  However you need to refer to the wikipedia related to the game to find out more of what you can craft and build.  Lots and lots of information on how to craft and build items.

There is plenty of food to find in game and water if you know where and how to look for it.  This is a constant effort you must do to stay alive.

The cannibals add to the game and make it interesting, but the mutants could be removed as in my opinion mar the game slightly, however they are integral to the back story and story line.  Needless to say I am not keen on them in game, they are grotesque, brutish and absurd (they are mutants though, so I must accept that).

There are to my knowledge 140 items you can build physically, and a plethora of items you can craft.
It's a thumbs up from me to the developers, for such an enjoyable game which I rate 9/10.  1 less than 10 because of the mutants, but that is just my preference.

Buy this game you will not be disappointed.  Check out some of the video's and reviews on the Tube.
Have fun and enjoy the game I personally recommend it. :)"

6433,"Very good survival game--but the jank and bugs are very real. Be ready to reload saves to get past the rough edges. Overall a very satisfying horror themed survival game, though."
6434,"The Forest is a great game to play alone and to play with friends, it brings a scare factor, even after you get used to the mutants and cannibals it is still pretty scary to run into them. There are some glitches but besides that i 100% recommend the game to people who enjoy a survival game with bits of horror to it."

6463,"It's great. Overall a very positive experience. I've had few minor bugs with cannibals spawning inside houses but nothing major. The building system works just fine, some extra furniture etc would be amazing though. Story wasn't that interesting to me personally but it's not a game breaking experience for me since I mostly do enjoy base building/defending anyway. Looking for the missing passengers was a great addition! Gaming experience is nicely modifiable via settings. Overall worth the money for sure, excitedly waiting for the new release."

6485,.
6486,"The worst fucking storyline, not that there is much of a story (not a bad thing), it's that if you do try to finish it, you'll wish you died in a real plane crash. HOLY SHIT, if google didn't exist it would be nearly impossible to actually finish the game; the number of times you go somewhere just to be told you have to go to a cave that you didn't know fucking existed to get an item you didn't know fucking existed is insane; the game doesn't tell you any of this! You'll just be trying to progress when you see something that you, for some reason, can't do/ make/ finish. Google it, and now you need to go back two caves and pick up a small item in an obscure place that you would've never known about. The story feels like a side part that they thought they needed to include but actually just ruins the game.

The game is brilliant, however, at being a fun sandbox where you build houses and try to survive cannibals. Though the building is horribly tedious, having 90% of it being hauling logs from one spot to another, gathering a little rope or some sticks, saving, and repeating. It takes hours just to build a simple wall or custom house and is honestly not worth more than a couple of days of playing."
6487,Screw this game! I highly recommend this game! It sucks! This game is amazing with friends!

6491,"Great change of pace from my traditional time killers. I have played a few others in this genre, but this was the first that stuck and that I have completed. If you stay task oriented, the game on normal difficulty could easily be completed in a few weeks time as a casual.  This is the game you need if you are in a rut with a specific other game and need a break. 

Pros that might be confused for cons: The intro confusion and lack of information ""is if as of you crash landed on an island."" You kinda just have to figure it out. 

Actual Pros: The game is relatively simple to learn, and the ambiance is a bit creepy even scary at times.  Even after completion of the main story I feel that I am still on guard. The story line is decent, but given the cost and scope of the game I'd say it is more than adequate.

Cons: After having completed the game, there is little reason to continue.  However, this game now has me more oriented towards other titles in this specific drama and I will absolutely purchase the developers next title ""Sons of the Forest"" when available."

We had a surplus of food
Managed to cut down a large area of the forest for its wood
And tormented the cannibals camp daily

i think we might be the bad guys in this story

6509,Very good game. Fun fun time. shiiii pants
6510,"A meh base builder, decent horror game, great co-op adventure, and fantastic Lovecraft-show-not-tell story. 7/10, and you can play without enemies just for the story."
6511,"I am thoroughly convinced that my ""friends"" who recommended this game are either mentally deficient or on the payroll of the developers. I cannot begin to comprehend how it boasts such a volume of positive reviews. The map is about tenfold as large as it should be given the current density of content. You will spend the majority of your time chopping trees to constantly build new bases in pursuit of actual content, lest you have a single base and must repeatedly trek over vast empty swaths of this abysmally oversized hellscape. 

If the UI and controls don't constantly remind you that you're playing an indie game, the sheer volume of bugs and jank certainly will. Enjoy the first 5 minutes of the game, because the little area around the plane is as visually appealing as it gets. Then, if you're me, you will discover a duplication glitch during your 6th minute. With geography less interesting than the procedurally generated terrain of Valheim, The Forest feels about as hand-tailored as a Hostess donette. 

If you've heard that this game is scary, you have been lied to; any level of fear this game could have instilled is completely overshadowed by obtuse progression which steals your attention from the story as you attempt to figure out what the hell you're supposed to do to stay alive. You have two options‚Äîwander around aimlessly (dying repeatedly of hunger and thirst) until you find what you're looking for, or give up, Google it, and enjoy playing the entire game with an ad-covered walkthrough and laggy interactive map open on your browser.

$5.35 I will never get back."

6533,"[h1]Fantastic Survival Game[/h1]
I have not played that many survival games but I can already tell that this is gonna be one of the best ones I'll ever play. You embark on a quest to find your lost son on a mysterious island flooded with butt-naked 'humans' which seem a little too hungry to anyone's liking. After encountering some saggy cannibal tits you'll be frightened enough to fashion yourself some shelter to keep away from the freaks as far as possible. The game has a good amount of exploration. You're looking at around 30-40 hours of gameplay with surface and underground exploration. Good range of enemies and of course, what would be a survival game without crafting? - The crafting is incredibly convenient and satisfying, from crafting survival gear to walls to housing items this game has a very great variety on what to build. There is no survival meta and the possibilities on how to play the game is endless. I mean, if you want to torture yourself you can actually play through the whole game as a vegetarian and even get rewarded with an achievement for it! On a serious note amazing game absolutely recommend at any price point to be honest."
6534,AMAZING GAME MAN
6535,fun to play with friends and alone lots to do and see.
6536,needs more polishing and fixing then maybe

6538,"Very good game, good graphics, good physics, good modeling, good everything, i would recommend this game if you have a OK PC and if you have the means to buy it, its a good game and good lore."
6539,"I really loved this game, it had a great balance of survival, building and plot. You can play at any pace you want, or could ignore the story completely if you want. Especially fun with friends, really looking forward to the sequel."

6546,I LOVE THIS GAME

6548,"This game is amazing. I can not wait for the second to come out. I am so glad I got this one. If you are into story rich horror survival, this ones for you."
6549,Yes
6550,there's someone looking at me from the treeline

6562,Well made game
6563,SPOOKY
6564,canibal
6565,"Honestly didnt even know I had this many hours in The Forest. I've gone through 2 playthroughs and I still wouldnt mind coming back again to play it. This game is set up perfectly for scaling and difficulty. When you first load in you're freaked out, but after a few days in game and have a base, everything seems fine. Then you go into caves and then you repeat the cycle of being freaked out. Very fun game with friends. Wiki is your best friend due to the fact this game doesn't exactly tell you what to do. Highly recommended for everyone, even if you arent a fan of survival or horror games (I'm not a fan of either.)"
6566,Best game of all. No words
6567,gaming
6568,Make a camp. It gets wrecked by naked roided cannibals. Make another camp. It too gets wrecked. This is not fun.

6570,Great story and amazing detail!
6571,I have a love/hate relationship with this game. Super fun gameplay but horribly glitchy at times and there are SOO many small quality of life changes that would make this game way better.
6572,"those cannibals aren't on something they are onto something
"
6573,"The game mechanic itself is good, the graphics and overall feel of the way it portrays is also quite simply brilliant (RTX 3060 graphic card), however the storyline of the game is dead. Instructions are bleek and you have to hunt and survive while trying to find other passengers and ""Timmy,"" very basic story. Just seems the game is trying to imitate Rust in certian ways. Score is 6/10. Good game for survivor based players."
6574,Naked females.
6575,I havent been on the game in over 5 months and my porgress reset on my friends multiplayer world.
6576,"Terrible game, I'm stuck in a cave for over 2 fucking hours"
6577,its fun
6578,This is a good game guys I swear. You have to listen to me.
6579,"the game is all fun and all until you get 10v1'd by the caveman looking infected dudes.
overall a good game to play with friends, exploring caves, hunting, fighting, surviving all of this in one game just makes the game really fun to play, the physics are decent, pvp is decent but what really makes the game fun is playing with friends. there is still some minor bugs but they don't really bother.

also dont get the game before u get friends (yes im serious)"
6580,
6581,"I played this game so many times before i bought it on so many accounts of mine just because its hella fun i recommend it

If i didnt play with my friends id shit myself"
6582,why cannibals so angry
6583,good now u buy lot more fun with friends and late at night now u buy.
6584,Cant sex Virginia  :(
6585,.
6586,So fun
6587,a
6588,"SO GOOD
"
6589,"To be honest it's a good game for the people who love to survival and adventure. You can craft and upgrade your weapon for fighting with the mutants and getting some nice armor from the special cannibalistic mutants too(but the armor will broke easily so just try to fight with them from far away). 
You can also find some nice stuff in the caves but it's really horror cause there's many special cannibalistic mutants inside.

The only place I don't recommend is there are many bug while I'm playing in multiplayer and the story is a bit bored for me...but I'm still having fun in the game."
6590,"THE TREES SPEAK UNTO ME, THEY WHISPER MY NAME! THEY TELL ME ""BUY BITCOIN"" WHAT THE HELL IS BITCOIN?!"
6591,"I keep destroying the campfire by ""accident"" and now, my friends won't allow me to go near it again.

Making no promises probably would destroy it again.

10/10 probably might ruin our camping trip again :D"
6592,awesome game

6619,i never find my son

6621,LOVE this game
6622,good game dont die
6623,This game is a true survival co-op game
6624,"Quick Review:

""I enjoy"""
6625,ahh zombie bit me on the ass
6626,"Bought reviews for sure as they are far from realistic. I simply don't see a possible scenario where I could give this game a positive review, even after following the game from release in all the way back in 2014. Bear in mind, I'm writing this review in light of the price tag which is, as of now, 16.79 Euros. I believe that the game is overpriced when compared to what it can deliver and here is why:

The bugs, the poor saving system, the abysmally goofy combat, the empty story line, the clueless progression, the occasional plummeting out of the map, the inability to commit sudoku when stuck downsides are so common place that it is hard to take this game 8 year game seriously. A complete clown fest. The USP of this game is what, atmosphere? Can't even stop laughing at the way player models have been made. Total automatons whose torsos are entirely immobile when arms flap about to imitate eating/fighting, legs - running jumping. But the torso and the head are just static objects. 

As mentioned the combat is mediocre at best. Either block or mash LMB. The cannibals are buggy, and overpowered at times. Buggy in a way that they would glitch through the environment and surround you. Overpowered in a way that they will gang bang you, because again, there is only two things you can do - block and hit. Cannot do both. The moment you stop blocking, you die. And the combat (swinging your weapon to fight) itself is so bloody goofy that there is only one thing that tops that. And its the bow. The bow is something a stoned first year game design student would make on unity as a bet. Animations are atrocious, aiming is garbage. Same with spears when I think about it. And for a 2014 game, god help the consumers. 

Also, perhaps it should be named The Cave System? Since the caves are huge, the player can easily get lost in them. And the caves are a place you'll find yourself spending most of your gameplay in. Navigating. But there's a silver lining - lots of loot in the caves. Quite attractive, right? Naw bruv. Loot anything in the caves, walk away for 20 meters, come back, the shit just respawns. Infinite loot. Balanced.

Inventory management- shit. Glitches with quest items. Crafting is goofy, difficult to manage - shit. The loops you have to jump just to set up quick select slots ""1 2 3 4"" is abysmal. All throughout the game, the devs have never decided on what keybindings do what. So forget familiarity with the controls. Because if you want to manage different items but in the same manner, then the controls change. For instance, to light a flare is LMB, to throw RMB. Molotov - light L, to throw LMB. 

Not going to delve into building, which is decent but far from perfect. Long story short, narrative is hollow and unclear. Game progression stalled by short term survival goals which can be tackled easily. Purposeless.

Overpromise, sell, underdeliver. Wish i could get a refund. Only buy the game when its 90% off.

6645,"Cons:
Somewhat glitchy - Don't EVER pick up tennis balls no matter what. Also glitchy enemies sometimes, will randomly throw you in the air if you step on the wrong thing... But that's honestly kinda fun. Remember to save every 5 mins at least.

Pros:
A genuinely fun and immersive survival game with OH MY F*****G S**T WHAT THE BALLS WAS THAT WHY ARE THE BAbIES FLyInG and yeah so you can combine or upgrade basically everything you find around on the ground in a really intuitive way, and you don't have to have recipes for anything, you can just experiment and explore putting different thins together. There's a great crafting system for medicines and ammo for bows, explosives even, and WHAT THE F IS THAT A [REDACTED] AUGHHGHH.....

7/10, worth at least 200 hours if you play organically and don't look up the (super helpful) interactive map someone made for it online. If you do look up that map it's worth at least 100 hours still. Not a game for the faint of heart, even on Peaceful mode. Immersion is intense and some elements are scary without the actual horror elements of the game which are, genuinely, very well designed horror elements. Even the story has an interesting twist."
6646,"Bruh, that 6 legged naked woman is my ex wife."
6647,goofy ahh game tbh. good boss fights and baby cave scary af
6648,#·Éû·É£·É¢·Éò·Éú·Éò·É°·Éì·Éî·Éì·Éê·É°·É®·Éî·Éï·Éî·É™·Éò
6649,"I enjoy survival games and did a bit of a huint, after No Mans Sky and ARK, this was looking pretty good.  On first playing I was a little bit lost, the system of bulding where you have a pretty limited blue print manual (where if it's not in it, you can't build it) felt restrictive, many of the features of the manual aren't game ""upgrades"" just aesthetic tweaks to a base, which incidently you don't need as it only serves really as a save and rest point, and the twigs and leaves shelter do that - so there's no reason to go to all the trouble of chopping logs for a wood cabin.  So there was a lot a can question, but I've currently racked up 28 hours on this game so something much be working!

On the plus side, the cannibal enemies are ""manageable"".  You can hear them coming from a long way away and prepare yourself.  As long as you face them and arm yourself with a nice pointy stick, you should be fine.  The mutants are a little tougher, but still not impossible.  I do like the ""direction"" it gives you, sometimes survival games can feel a little aimless, where with this, you have your ""to do"" list, you know you've got to find ""TIMMY!"" your son, so explore, when you explore you find caves, your todo list updates and only gets crossed off when you've covered the whole area, so have an idea if you've collected everything, you have to explore these caves which slowly provide reasonable upgrades which make the game more fun (such as aqualung to breathe underwater, flashlight, chainsaw to chop trees etc.)

I've not tried in in VR yet, it might be good but for the moment I'm happy with what it is and am looking forward to completion."
6650,i almost shat my self with the hardest mode
6651,Lives up to it's name
6652,"A must try game to play with friends. The story is fantastic.
Only issue with the game is the trading system, to give items to friend is frustrating, hope they change the system in the next game.
Eagerly waiting for part 2!!!"
6653,ok
6654,Mutant baby doing frontflip
6655,it good
6656,eat
6657,"Overall not bad but the bad is starting to out weigh the good. the lighter sucks, the flashlight isnt any better, the AI spawning at the plane is BS, constantly being swarmed by AI is getting old,  losing all my armor in one hit, even when its monster armor, is f-cking stupid, getting 1-shotted is trash along with the OP af enemy AI, I have the brightness up to the max and I still cant see jack sh!t in any cave or at night, can I really not make a regular, basic torch for more light? This feels less like a horror survival game and more like a rage deleted game.

Edit: Im keeping it out of spite, gargle my nuts."

6688,I have been playing Forest for the last 2 months and it is one of my favorite games. You never know where the plane is going to crash and you end up. The cannibals that come after you are great as well. as you go alone and get better the change and get harder to fight. I have yet to explore the whole Island. It is so much fum tp play alone or with a team of friend. Must get!!!!!

6694,not gonna spoil much but if you like survival games that can last forever THIS IS IT and even better THEY ADDED A VR MODE although if you are a bit.....skittish to the sight of blood then its not gonna be a fun one. i love the game for its multiplayer buffoonery. the game can go from AAAAAAAHHH IM GONNA DIE!!!! to PFFT the fucking sled did a front flip.
6695,"Fun game though it was a bit difficult to figure out the crafting system and how to set up your hotkeys. Maybe put in some hints for new players as we had to look up the information after trying to figure it out. 
For those still trying to figure it out:
[I] for your inventory right click the backpack to move it to the crafting area and then click the item you wish to have as 1, 2, 3, or 4. Click the wheel and then select the hotkey."

"
6711,"My son and I play this game and enjoy it so much. It is a bit of a survival horror genre but the shear ability to be creative with the tools given and the free reign to play side by side makes this game truly fun. If you have distance and commitments with a loved one you want to spend time with, I recommend this game. I am grateful for the opportunity this game affords us to interact. And it is certainly fun to chase down or be chased by crazy cannibals. Both my son and I agree, when cannibals run into traps around our base, is funny every time."

6779,The game has come a long way from when i first played a few years ago. My only issue is the CONSTANT launching into the air 20-30 feet when using a log sled. Which kills you everytime. Kind of a game breaking bug if you are on single player. Happens on multiplayer but not a big deal if you have a friend nearby that will revive you

6785,"boos be in game

6786,kinda short but worth it on sale

6788,The Forest has an excellent survival thriller/horror atmosphere with engaging building and exploring mechanics. My only complaints are that the building costs could comfortably be cut down by 25% or even 33% (maybe more in lower difficulties) and that the hitboxes/hitdetection could use a little more refining. Hoping that Sons of the Forest understands what made The Forest great and doesn't sanitize the experience into an arcade game like so many sequels tend to do.
6789,Easily one of the greatest gaming experiences I've had. This game has fantastic crafting and survival mechanics and an excellent narrative that slowly begins to unravel itself as you explore the world.

6801,"If you are looking to scratch that Subnautica itch, the Forest is a pretty good alternative. You start the game as a plane crash survivor in the middle of a forest. Your first several days, you explore your surroundings, hunt animals, find water and build a shelter. As you explore further, you realize you are not alone and you are actually sharing the forest with cannibalistic mutants.

There are two ways to play the Forest. You can focus on the survival aspect and build your own fortress, set creative traps and fight the cannibals. Or you can focus on the adventure, explore caves and find items to progress the main story of the game. The graphics and overall atmosphere are surprisingly good. It can really get scary at times, especially when it‚Äôs dark. Combat is a mixed bag. Enemy AI is pretty good, but I can‚Äôt say the same thing about the melee combat.

Similar to Subnautica, the game takes twists and turns as you progress and gives you a satisfying story, especially towards the end. 

Overall, I would not suggest the Forest is a must play. But especially with its co-op mode later added to it, you won‚Äôt regret your time with it and it could be one of the best alternatives available to the original Subnautica.

6804,"I have never been super into survival games - i got into Ark for a while. This one is a lot of fun and have played about 20 hours so far - bought it a couple weeks ago during the summer sale. I'm not very good at it so I've restarted a bunch of times but there's so much to do and many different ways to approach those first few days that I'm taking my time getting it right.  

I play single player, my son's not quite old enough to play with me, so that poses some challenges (like the first time i built a raft and realized I need two people to move it). It's scary enough to have me jump out of my seat during nighttime stone-gathering but not enough that it cheapens the game play IMO. The cannibal AI is probably some of the best I've experienced. They approach you from all angles, can dodge your arrows, and can recognize and change their behavior depending on whether you are covered in blood, mud, or paint which is cool. One thing though is that the deer AI is pretty stupid - I have tons of deer skin because they just stand there and take it.

It doesn't do anything particularly poorly, but there are plenty of games focusing on basebuilding/exploration or survival horror that are better choices than a mediocre combination of the two.  it is creepy, even on peaceful mode, but I am just constantly thinking of other games I'd rather be playing while I play it."

6903,it gets your heart pumping very exciting
6904,Quite a fun experience alone or with a friend. Me and my friend were playing earlier and we got jumped 3 of the cannibals with bats and eliminated them somewhat quickly. Very fun to headshot one with a bow. Plus all of the building you can do is really cool! And we haven't been playing for very long but so far its still a fun and not so scary and grindy experience. But you do have too cut down quite a bit of trees for really any buildings. I did try single player and it is fun but i must say just being alone with all the sounds is quite creepy and can be harder when fighting. I would definitely try to see if a friend would be willing too play with you!

6913,"I am a 45 yo father, probably one of the oldest people playing this game. I am a single father to my Son, who is 14 now. My son got this game for Christmas in 2021 from his uncle, so we installed it on his computer and he started playing. By the end of the week he had 24 hours on this game. This was horrible for me, as it was already hard for me to find ways to spend time with my son, as he is always out with his friends or just watching YouTube. So i decided to make a Steam account and get this game to see if I could maybe play alongside him. I loaded into the game, picked my character and world and started playing but I was stuck on what you where supposed to do. I asked my Son for help and he hosted a game for me to join. I loved it as it was the best time I had spent with my Son since my wife had died. This game has ever since brought me and my son closer again and now we actually spend time together outside the house together as well. This game reminded me that there's fun to be had in everything, and it has brought both me and my Son many happy memories."

6920,"This game is great.. If you have friends. I don't like that this game is only fun if you have friends. (3-4 is the sweet spot) Sure during the first 20-25ish hours it was great! It was so refreshing and new and with two other friends its amazing and an unforgettable experience. However the game is very, VERY linear, so not much replay-ability. (Unless you play it again on a harder difficulty (but even then its a husk of the first experience)) Very interesting ending and lore and guaranteed to make you look up a video explaining the lore. Overall should you get this game? Follow this ""flowchart"":
Do you have friends?
Are they willing to get this game?
Then yes, absolutely. If you don't have any, get some you antisocial piece of garbage.

Also you can't skip the credits so minus 4 points."

6927,"A wonderful game that offers aspects of survival, multiplayer and building aspects.
If you are looking for a game in which you like to build a base for hours with your friend, collect resources needed for construction, and then during the night defend yourself against hordes of monsters, I recommend it.

[B]Weapons:[/B]
A large number of combinations and construction of survival weapons, spears, bows, axes,ropes, rabbit traps, there's even a chainsaw to find ,a lot ....

[B]Base:[/B]
In short, the base can be built as you wish, made of wood or stone.A fort, a water base, a tower, a castle, a house, a treehouse, an entire village or just a shack.

[B]Survival:[/B]
The weather conditions give us nuts, eating and drinking is a problem at the beginning, the snowy part of the map will be cruel and the caves drain us from the water, breaks to the end, malnutrition or obesity, arthritis is the worst.
Make sure your friend has torches for the expedition, a sack of food and a water bag, make sure the water is clean.

[B]Feedback[/B]

I have been playing the game for several years, we play it on multiplayer with friends on the most difficult level, every night is a challenge,you are trying to keep the fire ,warm and nice ,and your friend is running with the spear and kicking the natives away, what more could you want!
The game is fun ,sometimes it serves a horror movie(The Descent 2005), I do not recommend playing at night you get a heart attack and life is stressful anyway!
I am survival games expert, I've already played everything, I always bet on realistic gameplay, this game is good and it will always be in my collection."

6944,"This game is the perfect example why you shouldn't have kids. Apart from the fact that they're expensive, aren't dishwasher safe and brutally honest, they will also ending up downing your plane and getting kidnapped so as to ruin what would've been a great holiday. Welcome to The Forest...

The Story:

You play as Eric Leblanc (in theory) and while on a flight to an unspecified location with your son your plane is shot down. It ends up crash landing on a peninsula where you are the only survivors and little Timmy is kidnapped by a strange man. It then becomes your task to tame these lands and rescue your son, unravelling a horrifying story of abuse and experimentation. The Peninsula has a rich history that is enjoyable and refreshing to discover but as the picture becomes more and more clear, the natural beauty of the landscape starts to take on a more sinister tone.

The Gameplay:

This game is played from a first person perspective and has strong crafting and story elements. Enjoyed solo or in multiplayer of up to eight players, you're thrown head first into this harsh landscape.  You don't start with much and quickly you'll realise you have to set up camp as well as find ways to manage your hunger and thirst. The game separates the survival from the story in a brilliant way as you can craft and explore as much as you want without the game nudging you in the direction of the story. You never have to touch the story if you're only interested in surviving the difficult landscape and that's awesome.

The Forest has a deep crafting system that you could make many useful things from. The things you make aren't like Ark: Survival Evolved where you start off with a simple stone axe and progress to guns and machinery. Instead everything you craft remains simple but adds convenience to your storage, housing or defence. All the designs look very aesthetic as you want to make your space look good in a survival game, but never leaves the realm of realism.

The game's combat is primarily melee orientated and there's a decent range of enemies that fall into two categories. The more common being the cannibals, isolated from the developing world for years and remaining very primitive and feral. The second being the mutants that roam the island. Grotesque, creepy creatures that will attack without hesitation. Kind of like the in-laws.

The enemy A.I. in this game is phenomenal. They adapt to combat by dodging, retreating or calling in reinforcements. Even during the early game, instead of mindlessly attacking you, they will prefer to watch you from a distance and stalk you while you set up your first camp. They leave you alone if you leave them alone. Only after a few days does their aggression increase. It makes for a very ominous and tense arrival. The mutants only start spawning after certain days too, organically increasing the fear and tension. That cannibal who scared the sh*t out of you on day one seems like nothing compared to the horror that comes knocking on day ten. In other words, as you level up the game levels up with you so you don't remain comfortable for too long. It's very refreshing and impressive. The animal A.I. on the other hand is atrocious. They will run into walls, through fire and freeze when you hit them. Their entire budget went to the enemy brains apparently.

The Forest from a graphical standpoint is impressive too. Beautiful, lush environments, different biomes, water and weather effects, lighting, everything was designed with real effort. A friend of mine brought up a valid point about the game's map. It's big, but not so large that it becomes draining to travel over it. It isn't miles of nothingness and is instead medium sized with plenty of landmarks so you can have a rough idea of where you are at all times.

Lastly on the topic of gameplay and the open world, we have the caves. Within the game are several interlinking caves that contain numerous enemies and story items. To progress in the story the caves are essential as you need certain items from within and they're a whole different world compared to the surface. If you hate the forest, you'll love it after coming out of your first cave. They're dimly lit, often claustrophobic, filled with nightmare fuel and confusing to navigate without a reference of some kind. Very atmospheric and puts the ""horror"" in this survival horror title.

Some Pros:
- Great survival and story compared to similar titles.
- Online multiplayer so you cry with your friends.
- Fairly priced for the great amount of effort put into this title.
- Gorgeous world & clever A.I.
- Engaging gameplay and progression.
- Various developer cheats and game modes to try.

Some Cons:
- Gathering the required resources with fewer players or for bigger structures becomes tedious and repetitive.
- The carrying capacity can be a bit irritating. You can improve the base amount, but a bit more would've been nice.
- For achievement hunters, some achievements are insanely grindy.
- Cave order and story progression is often very unclear. If you're a casual player you'll likely need a guide.

Conclusion:

The Forest is up there in terms of survival games and in terms of quality for your money.  It's fun, it's scary, it has co-op, is fairly affordable and it has a sequel releasing in October. It is often on sale and it is living proof that smaller developers can do far more with the resources they work with than these triple ""A"" corporations that will release a game in pieces and claim ""they had no idea it was in such a state."" I can't recommend it enough though. Among a sea of awful survival games, The Forest stands out as one of the greats."

"
7010,its fun
7011,goat
7012,convinced 2 of my homies to buy it with me and its the funnest shit ever
7013,"Before I begin, I would like to preface this review with a couple of footnotes:
1. I played through the game on Hard. In hindsight I think that was a mistake.
2. I played The Forest solo, and I think this is an experience best shared via co-op.
3. This review is just my experience, all reviews are subjective, and I'm going to try and criticize the game fairly.

Now that's out of the way...

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

I did not like The Forest. There was a lot that I didn't like, and not much that I actually did. I'll go through my experience (albeit anecdotal) to highlight why I feel this way.

Day 1-2
The game opens with a cutscene of you, the protagonist, losing your son in a plane crash. It is immediately implied he's alive and it's your job to go and find him. My first night I rely on some supplies in the plane, make a shelter and a rabbit trap to try and begin my soiree into the forest. No issues so far as I begin to build a more permanent shelter near a water source nearby. On my second night, I have a fire going in the dark cooking some rabbit that I caught that day. Out of nowhere a strange man rushes the fire and scares the shit out of me. First big scare on night two. I end up killing this [spoiler]cannibal[/spoiler] and get some rest.

Day 3-4
On the dawn of the third day I kick things into high gear, it's clear that this island is hostile. During the day I get raided by more enemies. I have to fight 3v1 in a nerve-racking fight that had me panicking the entire time. After this it's almost dark. I can't finish my wall tonight. I'll pick it up tomorrow.

Day 5-10
By the 5th day I have a wall, a cabin, a permanent fire pit, and a source of fresh water. Things are really looking up, and I can resume the search for my boy. While I'm reading through my survival guide inside the walls of my compound, more enemies show up and start bashing on the walls, damaging them. I wasn't even moving a muscle and a squad of them are beating down my beautiful wall. I kill them by hitting them through the wall and cheesing the fight. Little did I know this was an early precursor of what's to come...

As the days go by, I keep exploring and returning to camp, similar to a cat. A little further in each direction and then back to the safety of my walls. And [b]all the time[/b] I keep getting harassed by the locals at my home base, almost every day. This forces me to stop what I'm doing, cheese them through the wall, often wasting precious daylight, and then having to sleep until morning just to find MORE enemies to deal with.

By day 10-15, I realize there is little point to having a camp. I just waste time defending, cheesing, repairing, eating, drinking, exploring for a few minutes, and resting. Repeat. It's time to go do some serious cave diving and see what's really going on here.

Day 15-25 is where I really make my progress. However, almost [b]Every. Single. Fight[/b] is me aggroing an enemy, kiting them to the edge of their traversable zone and then stun locking them with my axe one at a time. I am not exaggerating when I say this was the ENTIRE COMBAT LOOP for me. Block. Kite. Cheese. Stun lock. Each enemy takes 10+ hits even with the [spoiler]modern axe with speed+ upgrades[/spoiler]. Again, partly my own doing because I elected to play the game on Hard.

Day 25+ was mostly the late game story for me. I will say the final chapter was pretty cool. But getting [spoiler]down the sinkhole[/spoiler] was not pleasant. A gauntlet of tough enemies and a harrowing battle with hunger and thirst, just to find out I don't have enough MacGuffins to access the final area. So I had to go all the way out, find those MacGuffin(s) and return later.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

In generally, I know this game is a Open World Survival game. But I think some of the core game design is flawed or just bad:
1. The Sound.
The directional audio is extremely poor at close range. During combat I kept glancing to my left thinking there were more people attacking me, but there weren't. The directional audio when the sound originates within 2-3 meters of the player is extremely poor, misleading, and not fun.
2. The Cheese.
This was my biggest gripe. Every fight I could not take on enemies more than one at a time. This meant some element of cheese in about 75% of all my combat experiences. In addition, if you have to repel or climb down to enemies, they will just swarm the rope or wall at the bottom and attack ad infinitum. So you just get beat to shit before you can dismount the rope or rock wall and square up.
3. No Auto Save.
I know this is an intentional game design, so I'm going to try and not knock it too much. I'm all for old school or hardcore design choices. But when you are deep within a cave, no way out, running low on supplies, and you are 2 sticks short of building a shelter to save, this is very frustrating. I died in places I worked very hard to get to and you don't just ""load checkpoint."" Instead, you are [spoiler]carted off to a cave across the map and have to work your way back to where you fought so hard to get to[/spoiler].
4. The Pacing
This was another major gripe. I wanted to immerse myself in the world. I wanted to become the Tom Hanks of the island. The survivor with amenities, a home, and supplies. The constant unrelenting raids, even when sometimes I was standing still in my cabin, AFK. I realized the best thing to do is just be a nomad, travel and eat/drink as you go, and all the base building be damned.
5. The MacGuffins
Some of the items in the game are almost useless but the game makes you feel like you need them. For example: [spoiler]If you travel north you encounter a snow area, which needs a warm suit. Not an easy item to craft. I thought there would be huge progression gains and the next leg of the game would unfold[/spoiler]. But nope, the item in question added no value and the area that it unlocked was devoid of life or intrigue.
6. Sequencing Breaking and Traversal
This is my final gripe. Due to my frustrating experience into the final third of the game, I started going down cliff faces or ""Skyrim-horsing"" up cave walls out of frustration. This led to some sequence breaks that were frustrating to untangle. Again, my fault, but the game should not allow you to clip on walls/rocks so easily.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

To conclude, I would like to bring in one of my favorite Open World Survival games: Subnautica. This genre's strongest point is a great journey of discovery and wonder. Though sometimes frustrating. But the feeling you get when you re-surface in Subnautica or travel to a new depth for the first time is truly special. I didn't feel that way at all while playing The Forest. It was a frustrating experience and the cave diving all felt monotonous and not very special. It didn't feel like I had really earned this new cave like I did in Subnautica when you first dive below 100/200/500 meters. 

There were some things that I did like. This game truly turned me into an island savage. The aggression I felt cheesing and stun locking enemies was intense. I loved driving my axe into their corpses over and over out of sheer anger at having to earn each individual kill one at a time through unconventional gameplay. The game [b]is scary[/b]. Going through some of those caves and my first time finding a [spoiler]Virginia or Armsy[/spoiler] was truly terrifying.

This game has about 95% Overwhelmingly Positive on Steam at the time of writing this. Most of you will love it. I was just that 5% that didn't.

Play it on Normal, play in with a friend, and you may have a good time.

But I did not like The Forest."

7068,"Imagine, if you will, that a modest-sized team with a modest budget decided to make a Far Cry game in Unity, emphasizing crafting and horror elements instead of virtual tourism and run-and-gun action. That's ""The Forest"" in a nutshell.

The protagonist is on a plane trip with his son when the plane suddenly goes down; when he recovers consciousness in the shattered plane, his son is missing, and there appear to be no other survivors. He begins to go about the task of gathering the essentials to ensure his own survival, and in time discovers that he is on an island (or possibly peninsula? The navigable play-area makes it unclear) populated by one or more tribes of unfriendly, cannibalistic humanoids.

The player, as the protagonist, will gather resources, craft tools, structures, weapons, and buildings, and explore the land and the caverns and tunnels beneath it on a mission to survive long enough to figure out what happened to your son. A successful player will likely do things such as crafting clothing and armor, making racks to stretch and dry meat from hunted animals, and learning the uses of poisonous and edible flora and fungi. The game tracks energy, hunger, thirst, and temperature, as well as the possibility of getting sick from blood-borne pathogens and toxins, and the player will have to put at least some effort into preserving the protagonist's health.

There is a mystery to be solved, and with persistence (not to say the use of game guides or FAQs), the player will gradually uncover it.

Personally, I found the game captivating. The graphics do a fine job of capturing the sense of a densely foliated forest and environs, and the cannibal tribes and other creatures are creepy and threatening. Crafting and building strikes a fine balance between realism and game-play, and there's a real sense of accomplishment in expanding one's base camp and expanding one's inventory of tools, resources, and weapons. Information about the place and its inhabitants is fed to the player at a slow and steady place, and as its nature becomes more apparent, the sense of dread begins to grow along with the discovery of new threats.

Be warned that while there are two ""endings"" to the game, none of the potential resolutions is exactly a happy-go-lucky ""win"".

There are places where the game's lower budget and level of polish become visible: the odd physics glitch, the interminable rope-climbing sessions as one explores the underground, the sheer number of times one has to ""whack"" an enemy or a prey animal before it finally succumbs. While the more primitive weapons available to the player are perfectly on point for the setting and theme, by the end I was occasionally wishing I just had a ""real"" gun to resolve a situation quickly; realistically, in many cases, the only quick resolution one can hope to get comes from running away. Combat becomes, ""Sigh, one more battle to use up a bunch of stuff I'm going to have to re-harvest"" some time before the game reaches its plot-conclusion, or at least did in my case.

Still, quibbles aside, I had a good time with ""The Forest""; it's reasonably priced, and packs in a good amount of enjoyable, satisfying game play."

I hope these devs go work flipping burgers for a living, at least then they will contribute something meaningful to society."

7096,"It's not scary. It's more like an average Friday night looking up bad ""anime"" doujinshi.

The one thing that really got me, was the tropical fish swimming in ponds and little bodies of water up on the mainland away from the coast. That, was because there was now the thought of the un-perceived threat, that the ocean tide rose very high, or that tidal waves were frequent. Of course the real answer was, the devs don't know a salt water coral reef fish from a freshwater river fish.

Overall Review: Multiplayer is buggy, but if you want to play together. Even in vr, well go ahead. It's more made for non-vr.. and I don't know how you'd make some escapes without doing it on desktop.

Edit: Will Revisit in the Future."

7159,"Very good game with very good graphics. 

I would recommend getting this game.

Good job developers!"
7160,"It's a GREAT game. I've known about this game since it was in development, I remember watching YouTubers playing this, and me begging my parents to get it because it looked so cool. But they wouldn't because they wouldn't allow me to play horror games so I looked up on the Play Store for a version of the game, and all I got was a really shitty version of this masterpiece. Imagine the Mona Lisa drawn by a toddler, that was what it was like to play on that bad version of The Forest. I was surprised to learn that this game was made with the Unity Engine. I remember watching people make games with this engine and you could always tell when a game was made with it. You just need to look at games like Who's Your Daddy or Crab Game to get my point. It's probably because they were made in a hurry and with the free version of the engine. This game how ever, it's really well made, the graphics are really great, the physics and sound are also really great. I have pretty low standards when it comes to those things but I think that for this price, The Forest is a game with pretty nice graphics. However, we can't have everything in life, so even this game has some drawback, at least for me... For starts, it can be really laggy. I don't know if it's my potato PC or some virus on it, but I have a GTX 1060 and three screens. And for a while, games that I play on this PC are really just turning bad with how laggy they get. I've tried to play with and without the three screens, it's stil laggy (maybe just a bit less, but still laggy some times). It's not like it's unplayable, but maybe every minute or so the game lags in some way or another. If you have a good PC and no viruses this should worry you.

I like how this game can at the same time be a sandbox game and a survival game. I haven't even finished the game, I focus more on building houses/cabins around the map. In October 2022 they will release the sequel to this game. Hopefully it will be as good as this one!"
7161,very cool game
7162,"I played it once for the story, then couldn't be bothered to go back into the caves and spend the rest of my hours killing cannibals.  A few rough edges, but the atmosphere is top notch, and setting up a ""Home Alone"" style nest of traps is a lot of fun."

I played this with 3 other friends and it's the most fun we've had for a co-op game so far, we haven't found any game that can beat it. It's a good mix of hunting/gathering and exploring the island which has so much to offer, without having too complicated mechanics. The game is pretty straightforward but it knows how to keep you on edge. Can be played alone but you'll get the most fun playing with others."

7209,"Very enjoyable crafting, but the story and exploration felt like a slog at times. There are key items integral to your progression such as [spoiler]a climbing axe[/spoiler] and [spoiler]diving gear[/spoiler]. These are placed somewhere in the world and can be easily missed when exploring. You can explore far into a linear cave before being expected to have an item you've missed, which means you have to backtrack. 

The ending also left a sour taste in my mouth. You can choose between two, and one of them just doesn't count as completing the game for some reason. Additional content is locked behind which ending you chose. 

If you wanted a cool story-based survival game which you can actually finish, just get Darkwood or Subnautica instead.

You gotta start progressing through the story and getting the better equipment fast or else you are going to have a really tough time. On day 10 you are going to have to fight some of the stronger enemies in the game and if you spent your time relaxing and just building stuff, you are going have a rough time facing these enemies."

7323,"fun game worth the price on discount, it's just an open world story game where you progress through finding collectables.
you don't really need to do the survival part like cutting trees or building a base, you can just run around and live off dead people parts and water you find in ponds

7330,"I would give this game 4/5 stars. 

At first I really enjoyed the game cause there's a lot of things you can build and discover, but after playing it for many hours and finding clues, the game got a bit tedious. 

Some specific things I didn't like:

- I spent a lot of my time getting lost even with my map and for the love of god couldn't find some things at all (like the raccoon or crocodile), maybe i was just super unlucky, but I went through the map thousands of times and just didn¬®t see them. 
- The caves are awfully dark (duh), but it's not even scary dark, it's just annoyingly ""where the fuck am I going"" dark and the torch, lighter and flashlight don't give that much visibility...so if it was meant as a scary element, i was more annoyed by it really.
- The story and clues...I mean the overall story was good, the concept of it fine, but I mean when I think about it, the clues, the documents were not very important and I would much rather have less stuff to build in the beginning and find parts of the survival journal with more blueprints to build. And even after finding all of the documents and stuff I was still mildly confused by the end and felt that it was a bit rushed? Had some plotholes? I dunno, was a bit disappointed. 
- I felt that the weapons weren't very accurate when it came to ""hand to hand"" combat. I would expect that where i¬®m looking the weapon would come down, but it just went somewhere else or under a different angle, so I just stuck to a spear most of the time. 
- Also the rebreather...it could automatically come off of your face when you're on land.

Things I liked: 
- The base building was great! Spent hours on my base and loved watching the monsters get taken down by my traps.
- I liked the overall scenery and map
- I played on normal difficulty and felt that the strength of the enemies was fair and liked to battle with them.
- I liked exploring, just felt that some exploring was for nothing or just some piece of paper that meant nothing in the end
- I really liked that the amount of things you need, even in multiplayer was always displayed and that there were a lot of things to help you carry more things


Overall, I still liked the game, just was annoyed by some stuff that made me glad that I finished the game and could just build bases :D

7331,"I am a 49 yo father, probably one of the oldest people playing this game. I am a single father to my son, who is 14 now. My son got this game for Christmas in 2021 from his uncle, so we installed it on his computer and he started playing. By the end of the week he had 24 hours on this game. This was horrible for me, as it was already hard for me to find ways to spend time with my son, as he is always out with his friends or just watching YouTube. So I decided to get this game to see if I could maybe play alongside him. I loaded into the game, picked my character and started playing but I was stuck on what you where supposed to do. I asked my Son for help and he hosted a game for me to join. I loved it as it was the best time I had spent with my son since my wife had died. This game has ever since brought me and my son closer again and now we actually spend time together outside the house together as well. This game reminded me that there's fun to be had in everything, and it has brought both me and my son many happy memories."

7407,"First of all, this game is awesome.

That being said, I wanted to mention a few things that bug me, because The Forest does so many things right that it's a shame to find these relatively obvious issues. For example, the custom roofs have 2 holes on the sides, and there's no official way to fill them in. I also think there should be much less cannibal attacks, because even if you're well prepared, it still gets really annoying and slows down your progress when you're trying to, say, build your base. I think there should at least be an option to tune down the spawn rates of enemies. The building system could also do with a grid, so that if you want you can easily align your buildings, instead of eyeing it."

7419,"I have played this game through now and it's a good game, not a great game though. I say that cause I feel it could have been so much more. 

 A lot of the enemies in this game feel like they could have been refined more in the combat, I mean the human run and jump at you and to avoid them you just step to the side. The mutants are a little more tricky but not impossible to kill. 

 The base building feels good but again I feel they could have done more with it. 

That aside, it is a fun game and I did enjoy it, I may even play it through again the future"

7465,"Being an avid solo backpacker irl some things about the Game really triggered me at first. Once you get the Old Pot SW corner of map, you can play the game.

That said it is really difficult and in its own way feels much like trying to survive in the wild. So far I've spent most my time just trying to survive, most often when I try to explore I end up barely surviving several nights away from my home base. I'm not sure what the %$#@ is going on here yet but I feel like I landed on the island of Dr Moreau or worse."
7466,"I am a 40 yo father, probably one of the oldest people playing this game. I am a single father to my Son, who is 14 now. My son got this game for Christmas from his uncle, so we installed it on his computer and he started playing. By the end of the week he had 24 hours on this game. This was horrible for me, as it was already hard for me to find ways to spend time with my son, as he is always out with his friends or just, watching YouTube. So i decided to make a Steam account and get this game to see if I could maybe play alongside him. loaded into the game, made my character and world and started playing but I was stuck on what you where supposed to do. I asked my Son for help and he hosted a game for me to join. loved it as it was the best time had spent with my Son since my wife had died. This game has ever since brought me and my son closer again and now we actually spend time together outside the house together as well. This game reminded me that there's fun to be had in everything, and it has brought both me and my Son many happy memories."
7467,good game for its type needs a few things to come earlier aside for that i would play it agian just for fun
7468,Da best survival game! Even better with friends!

The progression by exploring caves is great and the only down side would be if you overlooked an item by accident. The climax to the game works so well and is the prefect ending and set up for the next one. Looking forward for the Sons of forest.

7639,"Game is so dark its almost impossible to see AND I turned the brightness up as far as it would go. Tedious tasks when doing anything survival or base building, like taking 82+ logs to build my first cabin (and my favorite part where I let go of my log cart and some bad ground programming launched it into space). Combat is BAD, so bad its almost impossible to hit these acrobats they call cannibals and don't get me started on the mutants which seem to take 100 hits to kill. All in all, I was super disappointed in a game that has an ""Overwhelmingly Positive"" rating. I feel like we are playing a different game entirely."
7640,Its fun
7641,loved it super good to play with friends
7642,spider women is on crack

7645,Game is good to play with people but the game is cool
7646,i love calabalisma
7647,"The Forest is an excellent survival game that instills a constant feeling of dread within you. Almost no matter where you decide to settle, the cannibals(and other things...) can find you. And they hurt.

This game is a bit glitchy and the story absolutely comes second to the survival aspect, but I have to give it a pass since it was developed more by artists than coders. I love the little details in this game, like actually having to swing your axe at a tree from multiple directions in order to fell it, or having to boil your water before you drink it. The little sounds that play when you mouse over the materials in your bag. The fact that you can make armor from the bones of your attackers.

There aren't a lot of game breaking bugs, but building is still extremely annoying and finicky sometimes. You'll quickly find yourself with more food than you know what to do with, and the enemies can be very unforgiving. Even so, I've had a blast playing this game both alone and with friends, and though I don't have a lot of hours in the game yet, I definitely plan to play more."

7734,"Awesome Game, buy it you won't regret it. When I first bought the game, I thought of playing for a couple of hours but NO, I played for 10 hours straight with my friends and the day after 6 hours.

I played this game solo the other day. It was fun building, crafting, setting up traps, and getting good sleep. Everything was going well, Life was a good man until I found the cave. Not one cave, cave after another cave. I realized how scary this shit is when you're alone in a cave. Got pretty much some new items, killed cannibals, and most importantly came out alive.

After the cave, I found a deep hole that's where I remember what she used to say. xD"
7735,"Loved it, can be finished quite quickly by accident but that's a good thing in my books. The Story, atmosphere and AI are all great, especially when it gets dark. Overall, it's definitely worth the money on sale or not. Can't wait for Sons of the Forest coming later this year."
7736,deforestation the game
7737,"im only 11 hours into this game and im loving it, im a huge survival game fan ive played them all, Rust, H1z1, Ark, Atlas, 7 days to die, subnautica, dayz and so on, so when it comes to playing new suvival games im usualy not impressed, but this game actually surprised me, is it the best? no, probably not but its got things in it that just make you go wow, 

the wildlife has got to be the best ive seen in a game, the way they move, the way they interact with you and your surroundings, i give them 10 out of 10 for that, 

the building is good, the traps are inventive and brutal , building walls is pretty darn good, your not limits to flat areas , you can build up steep inclines and it doesn't look odd,

The Combat is okay nothing really special about it, range weapons have no cross hairs so can be a bit difficult

The Enemies, but god the way they move, the AI is pretty good, but also quite dumb at times, sometimes they will dodge like a pro move like and pro when they are being defensive but if they are coming for you then they can be quite dumb at times but still one of the best when it comes to movement, its not generic like some games where there is just attack mode and defend mode, these will doge, rolls, jump attack, leap , even climb trees, enemies are pretty challenger and increase in number as the game goes on,  

It has a story! unlike alot of games it starts you off on a plane (wont say anymore of the story due to spoilers) but right from the start it hits your heart strings,

Be warned this is a pretty creepy and gruesome, im used to this sort of stuff but  sometimes ill sit there and go damn thats just nasty.


Its so good i cant wait for the Forest 2"

7787,"The Forest is a game for those seeking a thrill and a challenge. With each camp and area offering a brand new challenge and mystery to the player. Whether or not its Groups of blood thirsty cannibals or large mutant beasts, this game is always full of surprises. Discovering massive hidden caves with secret areas is a blast and after seeing the trailer for The Sons Of The Forest, this game and the next is in the hands of very talented Devs. I highly recommend checking this game out."
7788,"I am a 52 yo father, probably one of the oldest people playing this game. I am a single father to my son, who is 14 now. My son got this game for Christmas from his uncle, so we installed it on his computer and he started playing. By the end of the week he had 24 hours on this game. This was horrible for me, as it was already hard for me to find ways to spend time with my son, as he is always out with his friends or just, watching YouTube. So i decided to make a Steam account and get this game to see if I could maybe play alongside him. I loaded into the game and started playing but I was stuck on what you where supposed to do. I asked my son for help and he hosted a game for me to join. I loved it as it was the best time had spent with my son since my wife had died. This game has ever since brought me and my son closer again and now we actually spend time together outside the house together as well. This game reminded me that there's fun to be had in everything, and it has brought both me and my son many happy memories.

10/10!"
7789,very great game
7790,I recommend this game
7791,I love the game its great to  relive anger on the cannibles its also  pretty great in terms of content and acheivements

the jumpy luggage is arguably the scariest part of the game"

7794,"Finished the game like 6 times already . . . . . . :P

There's naked people in this game, and you can also burn and eat them <3 
Cutting off mutant and animal heads is always fun !
The Story and Lore is fascinating, when you explore and finish the game especially ^3^

If you're a scaredy cat, play it with friends, or else you'll shit your pants most likely :D"

7802,"wow.. This game is crazy good. First of all, the lore is absolutely insane and also the items and customization. 

What it's about: 

You begin flying with your son in an airplane, but suddenly the plane catches on fire and crash-lands on a cannibal infested island. After the plane crashes you are greeted with a cut-scene where a mysterious red man carries your son away from the plane. For the next few horrifying days your goal is to get your son back.
 
Pros:

-Customization
-Tools
-Buildings
-Fighting system and game play
-Multiplayer
-Atmosphere
-2 Endings
-Health system (you can exercise and gain pounds and stuff)

Cons:

-Little buggy at times
-Grieving in public games
(not really many cons because its such a goated game)

All in all, this game has to be on my top 10 list also because it was much better playing with my friends. Sadly the whole experience was a little downgraded due to stupid old me spoiling the ending for myself. Good luck and choose your ending wisely..."

7804,awesome and recommend
7805,Fun game with an interesting twist.  Loved being able to craft and build almost anything.

7807,i sexd a cannibals ass

7809,literally couldnt climb a stupid wall and then fell and died
7810,"Started out OK-ish.

Never really got interesting enough to make me want to engage in the story, and the enemy AI behaves a bit weird and removes you from immersion. Won't bother finishing the story.

I don't get why this has overwhelmingly positive reviews. Maybe I'm giving up on this too early?
Are they mostly troll reviews? Oh well...

Maybe get at 75% off or something, imo.

5/10."

7813,"i have a pretty shitty pc so i was worried but this game was still really enjoyable on 20 fps and that is saying something. Multiplayer is kinda glitchy sometimes but other than some random stutters when entering caves, this game was amazing. Cant wait for 'Sons of the Forest'"

It's mad perfect for example wind's sound is horrible and really however you hear a funny sound when something fell in water

Some times it gets hard to fight with cannibals and [spoiler] find the true way in some caves [/spoiler]
but all in all you fix it with your fiends

Judging by what I see I reck on story is short and most of it is exploring but maybe I am wrong

you will spent a lot of time on this game for building and exploring surly and it's gonna be fun

Set my brightness slider all the way to max and it was still pitch black, even when using flashlights, torches and flaming arrows. Had to resort to console commands to remove the blindfold that this games puts on you.

I guess it's a cool concept but this just feels like an amateur project that isn't playtested."

7941,"after playing this game for a few hours, I've come to realize that this is what I was missing in life. Its a startle to turn around while chopping a tree down and see these half naked tribal, cannibal things staring at you. Then they all sprint off into different directions, and you're constantly watching around while cutting more trees, Just to have one jump scare you by standing right behind you. What a great story as well. I haven't completed the story yet but where i am right now I couldn't be more impressed. Peak Game for an amazing price. Super fun to play with friends. Or even make friends in their multi player servers. Up to 8 players, why not bring the whole crew."

7972,"I am a 45 yo father, probably one of the oldest people playing this game. I am a single farther to my Son, who is 14 now. My son got this game for Christmas from his uncle, so we installed it on his computer and he started playing. By the end of the week he had 24 hours on this game. This was horrible for me, as it was already hard for me to find ways to spend time with my son, as he is always out with his friends or just, watching YouTube. So i decided to make a Steam account and get this game to see if I could maybe play alongside him. loaded into the game, made my character and world and started playing but I was stuck on what you where supposed to do. I asked my Son for help and he hosted a game for me to join. loved it as it was the best time had spent with my Son since my wife had died. This game has ever since brought me and my son closer again and now we actually spend time together outside the house together as well. This game reminded me that there's fun to be had in everything, and it has brought both me and my Son many happy memories.

7979,"The Forest is one of those games that nearly everyone has heard of, but few have played, and even less have completed. This is perhaps thanks to its lengthy ""early access"" on-ramp and the 15 minutes of fame it experienced in the YouTuber circuit a little too far before its full release. While I was aware of this game and its premise, it got lost for me in the glut of 2010's early access survival craft-em-ups until I picked it up on sale recently and was blown away by its quality. 

Awakening in the fuselage of a crashed plane with nothing more than a hatchet and a survival book, the core gameplay has players sorting out how to supply themselves with clean water, shelter, and food in a remote forest while defending themselves from an increasingly hostile tribe of mutant cannibals and collecting clues as to what's going on and how to find the protagonist's missing son. The narrative is mostly communicated through notes, tapes, and other clues scattered across the titular forest.

Overall, the core mechanic of The Forest is discovery. Finding new points of interest on the map, experimenting with survival strategies, and picking up tidbits of a greater lore from assorted clues. None of the game's individual systems are particularly complex, and the real ""progression"" comes more so from growing your knowledge of the game and using it to your advantage. Having now beaten the game, it feels like one big puzzle that's immensely satisfying to solve piece by piece, but leaves me with little desire to replay since I feel I could easily meet the conditions to beat the game in a couple hours with the knowledge of what to do and where everything important is.

A major highlight is the AI for the cannibals, which is phenomenal and makes them feel like living, breathing people. Instead of just attacking you, they may stalk you from a distance, start charging you and then stop to watch your reaction, run away to bring intel about you back to their tribe, or even flee in fear or cower in reverence under the right conditions. They will always keep you on your toes and still manage to surprise me.

8/10, especially with co-op integration adding a lot of additional fun. A steal at MSRP, let alone the current sale price of $5"

7981,"Good story, rewarding exploration, and pretty decent survival game aspects. There are some bugs and minor glitches, but nothing bad enough to detract from the experience. Main complaint I have is the custom building seems to break or downright not work at points. Hoping they fix these issues with the next game. It's worth $20 and definitely worth it when it's on sale"

At the end there was no forest because of the tower, and the only things that spawned were Armies. Which I hate because they freak me out. But also they ran into my traps and died making funny noises so who am I to complain?

You will find cannibal camps every now and then, but 99% of the structures are non-interactable meaning you can't light the bonfires, live in the huts, etc. The crafting system is pretty fun immersive, but if you deconstruct structures you get NOTHING back which makes no sense at all.

8106,"I am a 45 yo father, probably one of the oldest people playing this game. I am a single farther to my Son, who is 14 now. My son got this game for Christmas in 2021 from his uncle, so we installed it on his computer and he started playing. By the end of the week he had 24 hours on this game. This was horrible for me, as it was already hard for me to find ways to spend time with my son, as he is always out with his friends or just watching YouTube. So I decided to make a Steam account and get this game to see if I could maybe play alongside him. I loaded into the game, picked my character and started playing but I was stuck on what you where supposed to do. I asked my Son for help and he hosted a game for me to join. I loved it as it was the best time I had spent with my Son since my wife had died. This game has ever since brought me and my son closer again and now we actually spend time together outside the house together as well. This game reminded me that there's fun to be had in everything, and it has brought both me and my Son many happy memories."

8168,"Very fun horror and survival game! I'm not that into survival games at all really but The Forest interested me because of its premise, its cool horror elements and that you can play it all in co-op! The Forest has you play as a father traveling with his son on a plane when it crashes and your son is kidnapped. You then have to find your son, survive day to day and deal with tribes of cannibals that can attack you at any given time. 

As someone who's not really that into survival games I found the gameplay to be a lot of fun actually. Building up a fort and various items to help you survive until you to the point where your in a groove and you can get by with ease. The amount of crafting options you have both from a building and supplies perspective is insane. The game also features a bigger selection of weapons then I was expecting with a couple of different axes, bows, a katana (my personal favorite), flare gun etc... You can find these in the various caves you have to explore to uncover items you need for the story. Exploring them reminded me so much one of my favorite horror films, The Descent, and the game even has a Easter egg for it you can find. The game is also quite the looker too with some gorgeous lighting effects and photo realistic graphics. 

The game also features quite a good amount of options both graphically and gameplay wise. You can choose whether buildings you make are breakable or not which was good since in the later half of the game you can have huge armies of cannibals attacking your camp at once, and it would just be impossible to rebuild everything back up before the next big attack. The enemy AI as well is really smart. While they attack you almost like how zombies do, they can be smart with how they overwhelm you. At the start of the game they won't attack you as much as they watch you from afar, but later they get more aggressive which makes the whole experience very tense. There is also a decent variety of enemy types as well. 

Lastly I like that the games map isn't too big. Its big enough to have interesting locations and landmarks for you to find but not too big that it becomes bloated like so many open world games fall into. 

In terms of what I didn't like there are a couple of things. Firstly I wish the story progression was made a bit more clear to the player as unless your checking a guide while playing, it can be very easy for you to wander around aimlessly or go into one of the later caves that your not really ready to take on just yet. A little more direction in the sequel would be nice but I get that they wanted the game to feel more open ended and for players to figure things out. Also at the end of the game you have to make a choice and you don't get the ""complete the game"" achievement if you make the choice your not supposed to, which really sucks. Might as well not given the player a choice at the end then. I also wish there was character creation as each time you die, you start back at the plane crash site and your appearance is completely randomized. Would have been cool if you could create and personalize your appearance, especially for a co-op game. They also use a Dark Souls like mechanic where if you die you have to run back to your corpse to collect all your equipment which can be frustrating if you were deep into one of the cave systems. Luckily enemies don't respawn in caves specifically after you kill them. 

Overall though, this is a solid game as it mixes survival gameplay, horror and cooperative play so well that's its very easy to lose a ton of hours in it. Highly recommend!"

8251,I love this game bro its SO GOOD
8252,100/100
8253,The best cannibalism simulator/ survival game i've ever played would recommend if you want to dissect you homies and don't know how
8254,"ok the game is good i can give if that, multiplayer is the good part but singleplayer its awful,
if you have a higher graphics card and use it on the forest with highest graphics (aka me here) theres a chance it can crash in multiplayer when you enter or leave a cave or make the map render in, the combat system is a bad thing aswell its kinda just like get the katana or chainsaw (which take 4 years to get btw) or the flintlock pistol and you kill also i know this is realistic style but there should really be a cross hair for spears/bows
and the save system sucks, but the game is good since the combat system can be good if you enjoy BEATING HUMAN MEAT WITH ROCKS, which i do so yeah good game
also not to mention in words of  my friend, BEAT SOMEONE MEAT WITH ROCK"
8255,"This game has a good multiplayer but single player is the worst the combat is good after you get used to it
the unneeded story pisses me off really badly"
8256,Never thought it only cost $20 for your house to be surrounded by backed women who want to eat my insides
8257,was fun
8258,e
8259,"Feeling constipated? Play this game, it helps"
8260,"bittersweet relationship with the game; at times it's a buggy mess with horrible clipping- but it's probably one of the best; most well known survival-horror games on steam.

plus the nostalgia factor is great. ontop of that there's alot to do aside from the main story however once you learn positions of certain items after multiple playthroughs, the game starts to get really easy."
8261,This game is amazing! I can't wait for Sons of The Forest! The best way to play is with friends (or play with strangers online).
8262,masterpeice

8265,"pretty good. scary monsters like the vagina multiple arms woman, and the multiple naked men who think they're tough, running at you. (tip) run behind them when they lunge at you and swing the shit at them"
8266,i like the building :)
8267,very good game funnier to play with friends tho and also fuck the cannibals specially the crawling fucks
8268,"Started a game on normal, 3 enemies attacked me within the first minute.  Dispatched them but not without some injuries.  Started going through the tutorial.  Build a fire, check, build a..oh wait 3 more attackers about 2 minutes after the first ones.  Ok interesting.  They move like 10x faster have 20x more health than you and can kill you in about 5 hits total ok let's do this again in the first 5 minutes of the game.  Killed them but was bleeding badly.  Now I'm also hungry and thirsty and night is coming on..let's go get some food and water now, we're fine.  Walk about 30 steps away from my fire.  Attacked by 3 enemies.  Alt+F4.

Random?  Bad luck?  IDK but far too oppressive for the first 5 minutes of the game.  Hard pass."

8296,Timmyyyy...such a good game especially with such a small team. :)
8297,i peed my pants
8298,"I'm going to give an honest critique of the game so that people like me know what they're getting themselves into. 

It starts off with promise. But pretty quickly you realize that it lacks the sophistication and attention that make worlds come alive and allows the player to feel truly immersed. Then, what the game lacks in options, it tries to make up for not necessarily in scale (because the map isn't that big), but in the quick turnover of days vs nights and the lack of stamina in your character forcing you to walk all. the. damn. time. Getting from one side of the map to the other takes forever. And along the way you have to fight off all kinds of savages, boars, even alligators. 

The movements are clunky and unnatural. The key-bindings are horrible. The field of view makes me feel sick. 

The worst part, though, is that there is no auto save, and you can't manually save your progress without first finding a ""shelter"" of some sort, or acquiring the resources for one and then building it. Warning: You'll need some of those resources and the time you spend getting and building them to make campfires, in order to cook meat and stay warm. At the end of the day this game feels much more like having one of those digital pets. It's far more work than it is play. And it's not as though it's even close to realistic. You can slide down a mountain face without getting hurt. You can eat poisonous berries and all it does is slightly reduce health. You can't run for more than 5 seconds without getting exhausted, but you can shotgun an orange soda and instantly have full recovery. 

This is very much an independent game. I honestly can't figure out why it has such a high rating. Maybe others have discovered something I haven't. 

In any case, the novelty wears off really fast. And there isn't much to discover. I already uninstalled it and I feel like an idiot waiting so long (less than 6 hours)."

8326,Great game! Better playing with someone :)
8327,"Awesome,haunting, atmospheric master piece of gaming, a little short story wise but it well makes up for this in crafting and survival. If you like green hell then your going to be one happy little camper (pun intended) If you like jump scares and sh**ing bricks at a random noises hidden dangers then its for you if you like crafting, base building or defence style builds its for you, if you like solo story adventure survival, guess what? its for you, basically if you like really good games with hours of fun for next to no money then...... one more time..... ITS FOR YOU."

8364,i mean the game's good but cannibals don't have any balls
8365,nice game to play with your friend
8366,"This game has many notable bugs, some of them are annoying but for me it didn't affect the gameplay that much. Playing solo could be hard especially when dealing with mutants, or cannibal family and it's easy to get lost in the cave (I'm having hard time to find correct path in the cave because it's so damn dark)."
8367,soloing 7 cannibals on a multiplayer world is one of the top reasons i have shidded my pants. would do it again.
8368,Fun game but the saving system is horrible. There is no auto saving so unless you are constantly going to your home to save it you are destined to lose progress if you die. I have lost well over 5 hours of progress due to the absolute dog shit saving system. This ruined the whole experience and I have no further plans on continuing this game.
8369,"it is a very fun and a good game to play whit friends
"
8370,"hmmm forest game
"
8371,"The Forest is a Singleplayer/Multiplayer survival horror game which you play as a father on an abandoned island searching for our son who is missing. The plane crash put us in this situation. 

For the first hours, this game was a boringfest. Literally, zero information and clues about where we are since the compass and the island map is hidden somewhere. When you learn the map layout OR randomly find the map and compass, game becomes excellent.

Crafting is really good at this game. Many things to figure out and craft. Graphics are good, optimisation isn't the best tho. Enemy and animal variety is alright, combat is really good. 

Overall, this game is great. Definitely worth to it's cost. Should try it out at least."
8372,Zor
8373,"Very, very good game to play with your friends.

I recommend this game to everyone because it is super fun, and it can be very intense.

Overall i think game has a lot of mehanics, you can do a lot of things in it like build big houses, barricades,  houses on water and tree houses.

There are a lot of mobs in game like animals, zombies and some tribes.

I have a lot of fun playing this game and everyone should play this game especially with friends.

I know the game is not that cheap, but when it is on sale you should buy it definetly."
8374,good game with friends :)
8375,"very good game, nice ending"
8376,"All in all once you learn how the game works, it's a lot of fun, even addicting.  You're not forced to do the main quest and you can go wherever you want, settle wherever you want and choose whichever methods you need to fight and survive.  There's lots of options the game offers from weapons to base building and gathering materials.  It can be quite the grind getting the things you need especially if you're building elaborately.  I would definitely give this one  a thumbs up because you're not stuck to some lame story and you're not bound to questing.  You just survive first then decide when and where you complete the main quest.  The enemies and bosses can be tough early on but the game gives you lots of options to get stronger and improve your equipment/armor.  The building system is a little quirky but once you get accustomed to how it works you do a lot with it."

"
8430,"The Forest is one of the better, survival and crafting games out there.  Building is straight forward, and fun. I love the fact that you can build traps for your enemies, it feels like such an achievement watching a cannibal walk right into a trap. I would really recommend giving this game a try, its difficult at times, but it doesn't make you feel overwhelmed either. Only complaint I have is the Unity engine, that makes this game run slow even on high end PC's. But really try the game you won't be dissapointed."

8467,"Actually pretty chill once you get a friend and a base going. Not too grindy either. I got this game on sale for $5 and it is amazing. 

10/10 would recommend

8468,"Played for two hours. Felt like I was fighting the game more than playing the game. 

I don't feel like the game has proper scaling. On the first night of the game, (and I'm talking like--less than 5 minutes into actual game play) 4 guys show up at camp and all attack me at the same time. All I had equipped was a hatchet and nothing else.  

In this game, when you die, you start all the way over at the plane crash site as a ""new guy"" with absolutely nothing, and your ""new guy"" is cold, weak, and hungry with practically no stamina. And when you re-spawn as a new guy, the freaks that killed me are still hovering over the backpack of my previous guy, so now I have to stealthily get my backpack again without getting killed, only to have a new group of freaks attack me 5-10 minutes later and kill me. 

During the times my guy was alive, I would kill birds to make food. 1 cooked meat filled my stomach 1/2 full, but a 2nd cooked meat filled my stomach 0. At first I thought it was just a small glitch, but it did this every. single. time. And there didn't seem to be a way to store the cooked meat to eat for later.  

I wish there was a ""cross-hair"" mechanic to aim your weapon or to focus on collecting items like in other first-person games. 

After ""dying"" 12 times in two hours and making absolutely no progress, I was pretty fed up with the game. Planning on refunding."
8469,Cheap and fun with friends

8536,i ate hella dudes
8537,"I liked The Forest from the start for a couple of key reasons .. The environment you move through in the game actually gives way to you.

The saplings and bushes wont stop you dead in your tracks. A simple stiff arm from your character pushes them gently away and you move through the environment ergonomically, the way it is intended. This gives the user fluidity and a more realistic and natural feel.

Another reason is the looting and foraging and discovery of New things/items. 

There is an interesting Survival Booklet available for identification and reference with a Push of the D-Pad. All things crafty (and neatly illustrated) are easily accessed here.

Im just getting into The Forest .. but I can see already that this was a wise choice and a bargain for $4.99."
8538,"The base building game, that discourages base building. I enjoyed the experience, but still pissed that my long spent base had to be abandoned due to overpowered mutants turning it to swiss cheese."
8539,"Apart from the console commands being a big ol' pile of GAR-BAGE, gameplay is good and I do love taking my anger out on any of the mutants roaming my giant tower of fire. 8/10, fix commands, and bring back my spears."
8540,very good my friend got a glitch without anything in his inventory

8678,"So from a surface perspective I see why this got so popular. Actually creepy horror and build things that feel like they'll never hold up.

At this point in time, I feel like the game might be seriously showing its age. I never bought it when it came out,  but you can't expect a game like this to hold up great for more than 5 years.

I'd love to actually explore and get creeped out a bit, but apparently getting rid of the creepy assholes that stalk you causes floods of them to come and try to kill you. Also, apparently trying to build and have a good time does the same?

So why even have the game at all? Why not just have a lighter, temporary shelters, and fire? If you were truly going to have to live in this place, why?

So in essence, the things that make the game fun are the things that just slow you down to keep the game from ending. It's pointless, and not in a groovy nihilist way."

I tried the game in the VR version, and found out how buggy it is. Its not bad but it could use some improvements.
When i try to open the suitcases with the axe it makes me... Taller? If anything when i crouch down to the ground i get taller. Yes i have the ""In Real Life"" crouch setting turned on. If you crouch down it makes you taller. But anyways,  Over all if you don't play the VR mode its a good game, i feel You shouldn't play this alone though, as people make it alot easier to play. It can get tedious at times. And is more funny with friends."

8757,"I got the game for 4.20 euros and Jesus how good of a bargain that was. It's packed with a lot of content, crafting, building, exploring, horror elements, it has a cool lil story, it adds a level of survival depth of by implementing infections, coldness, poisoning, hunger, thirst etc. tbh i got scared shitless 2 or 3 times, picture this scene: it's almost night, u r just chopping some trees minding your own business, talking w a friend and u hear EEEARK, turn around and see a cannibal flying at u. overall pretty good game, excellent for playing w friends, almost 13 hours in and I know I'll play it for a whole lot more.

ps there are naked women and u can chop and eat people"
8758,Very good game.  I wish there was a creative mode where you could build whatever you want without resource gathering.

8777,Woodcutting simulator. I have no idea why all these shitty Minecraft clones focus so much on the least fun aspects of Minecraft (the resource gathering) to be the largest percentage of their gameplay loops. Not even worth the $5 i paid for it on sale.

I hear them running in the woods.

I'm hungry. I'll leave camp tomorrow and search for food.

They're becoming more. I have seen five of them right behind the camp wall.

I can hear terrible screams further away from camp.

It's night. Where's Timmy? I miss him so much."

8797,The graphics are lovely super immersive in my opinion (the monsters startle me a lot ngl) the story line is super interesting and honestly i love the crafting system in this game its really intuitive and i would recommend it to anyone who loves horror survival. I would rate this game a 8.5 out of 10!

8837,"Actually decent open world survival horror game with solid mechanics; The horror eventually wears out after you figure out enemy types and behavior, patrol routes, and learn which items block effectively and which attack better, but it is still pretty good for a first time experience, it sure as hell made me jump a few times back then. (Pro tip: use M131 color grading)

The map isn't a procedurally generated one either which I think is better, you can memorize it better and familiarize yourself with all the proper item, build, and resource locations.

Combat is meh, you attack and you block, then finish them off, with mutants you just attack and block, there are bows, and the throwing spears, but they have some very jank aiming that you have to truly master for  them to be any good, there is also the flintlock pistol and the flare gun but they're also meh.

Building in the world is relatively simple, you can't manipulate the terrain but there are countless structures that you can put down and connect and you can actually make a lot of creative stuff with it.

Story is non-existent, to be honest, I've played through all of this game without ever interacting with it besides picking up a few items from the caves.

Overall, pretty fun, I have like a decent 100 hours or so on this game on a pirated version, but I eventually ended up buying it for multiplayer shenanigans."

Graphically the game looks outstanding, not even that demanding on my system, although i have a beefy PC, so that helps.
VR UI is a bit on the meh side, especially because i am lefty, but it is bearable.

I'd say full price is very reasonable and at 4‚Ç¨ it is a steal.

The game doesn't actually have a proper story so that's a bit disappointing. It is Rust in VR, not even PvP, but PVE. Still a good game though, but not what i initially thought it will be."

8881,"Awesome game!! Fun game for people who like AOE type of games. 
Simple and minimalist game unlike the new ones that comes with 1000s of things to do. 

Strongly recommended for some looking to play with friends!!!"
8882,"One of the best of the many, many survival games I have played. It focuses on survival, exploration and plot instead of getting bogged down in annoying micromanagement and needlessly over-complicated mechanics, which is a failing of many others in this genre.

Beyond that, the tension, creepiness and horror in this game are really well done. It is a dark title, so you should expect plenty of gore and death... but done in a way that serves the plot and the gameplay.

Definitely best if played with 1 or more friends, but also totally doable alone. Can be played pancake or in VR, and both versions can play on the same server. Note then when I played it in VR there were some specific bugs (like cutscenes not displaying), which may or may not have been fixed... but otherwise it was a solid VR experience and I was really happy I could still play with others even if they didn't have VR gear.

A good purchase at any time, highly recommended especially if on sale."

You can have a great time with your friends. The game is very good, but there are still problems in optimization. Those with bad computers may have some difficulty playing. I think the concept and the story are very good. It is not a very short game, you need to spend some time to finish the story. It also has several different endings. Cutting a lot of wood, mommy -.-"

8892,Really good game
8893,"First of all I bought it on sale for less than 2$ and I did get my money's worth out of it. But It gets extremely boring and repetitive after a while. During the first 5-10 hours, you're super excited for all the items you get to discover and the challenges you face in your expeditions but After that, after you know most of what's to come, The game becomes quite tedious. 
You repeat the same tasks again and again, whether it be Hunting, Forestry, Base building or fighting off Cannibals at night. It all becomes a tedious task. Sure Base building is fun but only at the beginning when you've just started to discover things.

Bugs are there but it only crashed a few times for me and my friends. Not to mention that your Raft can penetrate any structure on water. 
Just by building a base on water, you become completely devoid of death by cannibals at night.
There is no real depth to the game, but for 132 Rs. or less than 2$, it's most definitely worth it. But never buy it at full price."
8894,Very fun and scary and the same time

8907,"Holy shit guys this game is straight fire! Why should you buy this game? Well basically the game is about finding your retarded son or something idk really man all I know is that I as the player must grab rock and hit things with it to survive. The Forest is a well developed survival game that challenges you to your very core. Also pussies grab the axe at the start of the game and chads hijack a plane, crash it near a lighthouse, discover a underwater city and kill it's owner while naked. Anyway I give this game a 0/10 because it fucking sucks and I would rather watch Bear Grills fuck a bear than play this game stupid game."
8908,"I love this game. The story and the building. And the fighting as well. This game is well crafted and amazing.

8916,"great game, fun to play with friends. The best part about it is that the developers have taken the time to look into aborginal australian history, really immersive and makes me feel like im captain cook in 1770. From the natives climbing trees, attacking you, stealing your stuff, its almost like the devs have just captured sounds and footage from WA, QLD and the NT for the natives sounds and movement, attacking in numbers trying to reclaim land. me and my friends are just humble settlers, cutting down forests and trying to get my son back, unfortunately, just like the in game aborginals, they don't like you doing stuff without their permission (which, like australia you'll never get). The growling and huffs and puffs are also, what i also assume to be australian aborginals, small brain monkeys unable to put together a sentence, so their body language and sounds they make from their mouths to be very surreal to me and almost frightiening with the similarites. Furthermore the face paints and body paints are very similar to aborunorginals and what i'll also assume is american indians. The only gripe I have with the game is that, they took my child, unlike the common story by aborginals that the white man stole their kids, seems like history have it wrong, it was the native population. Stolen Generation? no, stolen timmy, i guess thats what happens when you fly to the Northern Territory, WA or QLD and you end up crashing, overrun with small minded individuals who have been there for centuries but only made fire and stop progressing with their evolution. Speaking of the white man, it is assumed that the cause of the problems for the aborginial population, both in game and in real life is the over consumtion of strong liquor and petrol, just like the aborginials in real life, very well mimic with the in-game population, they have it stored in their huts that have been there for centuries. Centuries without progression, you would think that if they weren't monkey brained, they surely should be a global super power? no, the substance abuse is obviously rampant in game as well, with petrol can, poising the minds of the natives, just like real life. If they weren't drunks with 2 brains cells fighting for 3rd place, I could put these bludgers to use, but just like real life they will abuse the government system, getting money and benefits to sniff more fuel and drink more booze. Its quite sad how similar it is, unlike real life however, i have fun slaining these tree huggers, when i do it back in australia; they use the little communication skills they have to call the police, well, whatever police they can that isn't wrapped up dealing with their own people. But, how do they have alcohol and petrol you may be asking? the Aborginal populus will want you to believe it was humble white men like myself and my friends, but the denial and the lies make them angry, perhaps another reason why they attack you like in Townsville and Darwin. Best of luck surviving, like the forefathers before me, Captain James Cook, my friends and I will stay vigilant and press on the struggle. all in all very fun, being from australia myself, its quite the delight having a game based off the aborginal population, past and present."

8981,amazing game would recomend
8982,forest
8983,kill the natives unga bunga pillage bone armor
8984,this is one of best games ive ever played
8985,"Okay so this game is kind of cool. There is a forest. And cannibals. They eat people by the way. And you have to survive. And you can get better stuff. Don't just survive, you should thrive. But now, I shall finish my goal of killing every tree and making the map the ""not forest"". Fun game."
8986,"yeah its really lit and stuff
"
8987,"If dismembering people is your top gaming metric, this is hard to beat. I give this two thumbs lopped off."
8988,This game is perfect
8989,it good
8990,I eat people. Why. THIS IS SAD. 10/10 game
8991,BOOBIES
8992,10/10 can eat people with friends
8993,when you die you cant respawn on your last save point unless you log out and log back in. it makes the game very annoying.
8994,"its just a game where u survive against the elements, nothing more."
8995,One of my favorite games.
8996,"fun with friends, terrifying solo"
8997,great game with friends
8998,i love eating people
8999,cut tree build house

9006,"Multiplayer if full of children, hackers, and ""modders"" ( if you can even call them modders anymore). NOONE wants to play the actual game they just want to cheat which takes away a lot from what little game there is."
9007,good
9008,good game
9009,"pretty alright, man"
9010,good game very fun waiting for sequel very excited
9011,A really solid survival adventure whether you're playing solo or with your friends
9012,Better than expected actually. Worth a try!
9013,game is super fun to play alone or with friends. can be a grindy game if you want it to be or you can kind of just run through it. either way would highly recommend
9014,"i wish peaceful mode meant more like ""hey cannibals whats up? oh marcy got sepsis? thats a bummer. no i still aint found timmy, but honestly i aint been lookin. say what? YEAH MAN ID LOVE SOME CUTS OF MEAT. we should barbecue together sometime, maybe discuss some time share/all you can eat buffet opportunities. ok bye cannibals see you tomorrow""

but instead, its either all or nothing. i want an inbetween experience that doesnt bother me with the symantics of whether my flesh is tasty or not because we homies and stuff. otherwise, yeah man its a forest. 

honestly though, this game rules. you can pretty much get the experience you're looking for no matter what. only advice i have for newbies is you gotta cut down the small twig like trees to get leaves. that may seem obvious to some, but theres alot of stuff like that you wont catch until you do it by accident"
9015,10th night is cancer
9016,"nice survival game, especially with friends"
9017,COOL
9018,"A game that contains a lot of bugs and flaws, that will never be fixed. My recommendation is to skip this one and save your money or choose a better game."
9019,There is a substantial bug. If you have two monitors and if you alt tab you have to restart the game because if you move to the right far enough your mouse will move over to the other screen so if you click it will tab you out. The game itself is really fun and I love it a lot which is why the bug was really annoying for me since I assumed that my game was fucked. Its a great survival game overall and is worth a buy when its on sale. The monitor bug needs to get fixed though

9033,yes
9034,its just good
9035,i love beating naked people to death and eating the corpses
9036,No words to describe how good this is
9037,"Currently semi-enjoying this game, but there are some bugs and A LOT of QOL improvements to be done.

Some examples. 

When you die you always spawn at the same start point as when you first started the game? Why not give us spawn at base?

When you finally find your body after dying and if you are carrying the axe you gain from spawn, you will get the message ""too many axes"" or something like that. The result is that you keep your default spawn axe, and the one that you have upgraded to max disappears..... 

Bug: When using weapon, character will sit down instead of using spear/axe or bow??? 

Building is weird, especially your own custom cabin. Walls/roof simply won't construct where you intend to.

Will give a negative review now, soley because you can't loot your upgraded gear from your dead body if same category of item already exists in your inventory. I don't think you can drop it from your inventory either, so there's no workaround."

9052,"For a game released in 2014, I'm quite impressed. There are a selection of reasonably advanced mechanics, and the graphics are very good. Definitely a game I can see myself playing more with friends."
9053,"At first you might find it very hard to deal with, but after spending couple of hours searching and discovering you will start to be interested in the world, and you will start going in this island all the ways to the caves and beyond, eventually you will get the interests to find out about this island and the creatures in it, the ending was fine 7/10.
i want to point at the mechanics and the animations of many weapons and movements also some bugs, i know the game is having a rough time with a small studio and company, keep up the good work on next part."

9071,"I am a 45 yo father, probably one of the oldest people playing this game. I am a single farther to my Son, who is 14 now. My son got this game for Christmas from his uncle, so we installed it on his computer and he started playing. By the end of the week he had 24 hours on this game. This was horrible for me, as it was already hard for me to find ways to spend time with my son, as he is always out with his friends or just, watching YouTube. So i decided to make a Steam account and get this game to see if I could maybe play alongside him. loaded into the game, made my character and world and started playing but I was stuck on what you where supposed to do. I asked my Son for help and he hosted a game for me to join. loved it as it was the best time had spent with my Son since my wife had died. This game has ever since brought me and my son closer again and now we actually spend time together outside the house together as well. This game reminded me that there's fun to be had in everything, and it has brought both me and my Son many happy memories."
9072,eating canibals its great also jimmy f you
9073,"The game has been amazing! Ever since i purchased it, this game has been nothing but fun / horror game to either play alone or with friends. The storyline of it is so breathtaking and if you really dig into it so detailed, it is insane, I can't say nothing else than just recommend it."

9281,"Not sure how to start or say, but it will be a review from someone who enjoys doing mindless tasks in survival crafting games and building.

[list]
    [*]No tutorials ( figure out like in minecraft or google youtube how to assign hotkeys to weapons )
    [*]You need too many prompts to craft/build anything in this game. Often issues to highlight E on campfires/water sources.
    [*]Limited inventory for sticks yet you can carry entire axe arsenal and oxygen diving bottles . . .?
    [*]No in game map, you can't draw one either.
    [*]Building system does not snaps properly, its not very intuitive
    [*]You can't disassemble build structures, you loose all materials. Even if enemy destroys them.
    [*]Crafting requires way too much resources. Come on grinding for wood logs or sticks is not fun at all.
    [*]Can't free place decorations or items. Just on Wooden Cabin with limited space/pre-placed zones.
    [*]Lackluster in terms of decorative buildable items.
    [*]Gathering resources does not feel fun, not any items make it easier or reduce the ""grind"" aspect.
    [*]Torches in this game apparently only highlight 50 centimeters in front of you.
    [*]You can't equip torch or flashlight to replace Lighter. Can't even equip 2 torches at once to dual wield.
    [*]A bald cannibal can destroy your log house that requires 89 logs in few hits
    [*]Corpse running, ie die and go back retrieve your loot. If you log out you loose your items completely and start over.
    [*]Can't save your character in multiplayer, it always resets.
    [*]No additional configs for server to alter enemy difficulty or hunger/thirst ratios
    [*]Combat is very stiff with no melee feedback. Feels like you jerk off with your own feet.
    [*]You can't block with spears?
    [*]Hitboxes in this game are terrible i often ended up hurting my friends or removing part of my household.
    [*]Visited 2 caves and already got 2 mutants and 5-8 canibals attacking us every night.
    [*]All nights was us sitting at campfire waiting. We could skip the night with bed but i call this immersive gameplay experience 
    [*]Birds landing in your house windows are kinda cute, but they tend to ignore everything elsewhere and just noclip thru everything.
[/list]

This game is not that fun at all. Gathering resources becomes monotonous and enemy attacks become annoying. Entire lore in this game was to hang up bodies on the ceilings, put tons of skulls everywhere possible and dismembered body parts.
This game is from 2018 but feels like 2008.

This game has potential and good idea behind it, but maybe in sequel.

Nah im not gonna watch 10 minute long youtube tutorials how to get X or Y works. Valheim, Rust, Terraria ,Project Zomboid, ARK didn't needed that, and are less grindy and more fun when it comes to resource gathering. Not to mention combat system."

Imi place la nebunie sa fugaresc canibali cu prietenul meu Kenz.
Ador sa explorez cave-uri cu prietenul meu Kenz.
Kenz este ce mai tare samurai cu Katana.
Mai patim sa ne impotmolim in cave-uri dar nu conteaza, daca sunt cu prietenul meu Kenz , totul este bine.
Eu si prietenul meu Kenz mai mancam si spoiled meat cand chiar nu gasim nimic de prajit.
Kenz e prietenul meu!
Eu sunt prietenul lui Kenz!
Noi suntem prieteni!
The Forest este cel mai grozav joc pentru ca pot sa ma joc cu prietenul meu Kenz.

When we first loaded in it gave us no pointers nor indications on what we were supposed to do, as a result we all perished on the first night.

Not only that during the Night it gets soo dark that the game is impossible to play during nighttime.

But ignoring all of that it was fun to cut down trees and craft buildings as well as learn to be self sufficient."

Compared to other similar games, the grind for resources doesn't feel endless and It's story driven, which makes it feel that you have a common, interesting goal to achieve.

9381,"HORROR

My friends were inviting me to play this game, I have never heard anything about this game and didn't bother to look at reviews and others. But I never thought it would be really scary.
The gameplay is sometimes confusing and sometimes I need to find information on the internet about it. It is a really good game for people who like survival, horror, and realism (since it didn't have any crosshair whatsoever).

Oh but there is one thing that still bothers me a lot, there is no such thing as choosing avatar. I can't choose anything about my looks in the game except for clothes that is available throughout the game."

9445,"Give me multiple systems to enjoy your game, then penalize me for even attempting. Good god the time wasted gathering 5 rocks or loading up sleds with logs. Fight off mutants 1x in the morning, be attacked by a patrol while gathering material to fix what the first wave broke. Now that everything is back in order and your base is set back up ( traps/ rock walls/ engineering at its finest) be prepared to wake up the next morning to see 2 spider mutants one way and 2 rhinos the other. So begins again the loop of garbage that does not respect my time whatsoever. I explored everywhere that wasn't cold, spelunk[ed] until my eyes bled, had immense amounts of materials/ weapons/ and a very impressive setup only to realize about 9ish hours too late for a refund that these devs just wanted to be jerks and try to stretch out their unrewarding experience. Don't worry, if you haven't reached the level of 'respect my time or I won't play your game', you will at some point in life.

Edit: Game is a lot more fun if you simply abandon the idea of a base. Believe me, if you live on the move you WILL enjoy it. Changed thumbs down to up after making a personal decision."

9541,"The two hours I have in this game at this point was entirely me getting frustrated that my builds would disappear if it seemed like I put something a little too close, builds that glitch out that I cant finish, Imean I had two walls in my base completely vanish after I tried to put a little shelter in the middle of the circle I had made. Doors would also build backwards which I couldnt change and it wouldnt let me enter my base. I would put more time into it to try to enjoy it more thoroughly, but it seems like every inch of progress I make is pushed back three steps by some bug or glitch or god forbid intentional game design."

If you don't find him in 30 days the Zombie Tribe will sell him for 1 mil profit & your boss will shoot you in the head."

9562,"Worth every single penny, even worth more than what you get, Fantastic game, several hours of playback, with evolving cannibals, super scary but empowering. If you're after a horror game with adventure and teamwork this is your game!!! Or rather Experience!!!"
9563,"i would say 7/10
it had great beginning, not very obvious but not very bad tutorial, cannibals are sick! nice lil change from the ""zombie games"" style, special cannibals? almost feels like l4d2, loved it! building anywhere u like whatever you desire? Awesome! 
so why didnt i like it? well you see...
combat mechanics are awful... it has good potential if they improve it tho! enemies can kill you in about 3 hits now i understand it should be challenging but still, not fair. armor is suprisingly weak, very weak. easiest (kinda)  to craft is the bone armor which takes alot of effort to get just so it get destroyed in like 3 hits? 4? in a  1v1 fight against a cannibal. its ridiclous, sure you can dup but thats not an excuse. as for the  combat, its awful.. i struggle to kill anything with melee idk it feels like they need a lil tweak both the player and the cannibal, especially the cannibals they sometimes sprint thru objects or run like a super sonic! (same goes to some animals.. maybe all of them ) their attacks are bs, i tried but it feels so glitchy it need some improvements. especially when my player tries to finish off the enemy on ground. story is cool but i wish my character said somethin about the situation... he does moans in pain or when jogging so why not speaking? the cutsene towards the end was a lil not that bad but it felt like they shouldve polish it a lil (around when you meet the final boss baby)
i only replayed the game 2 times just to see the ending. there was no point to continue afterwards survival due to nothing interesting really happening afters and the cannibals become tougher and harder to kill after a while which didnt motivate me to stick around longer, you know.. the combat issue and health system.
the multiplayer part was bad, so bad in my experince.. if you have no friends with this game dont bother play with strangers... it happened to me many times i spawn in airplane with a wall and a door locked. unbreakable one too! either i wait til i get their permission or just starve in there... other times i keep meeting new servers, new peoples its not bad but i hate i must start from the beginning with 0 stuff in me, i got tired of it.
nothing really motivates me to continue playing this game after i finished the story pretty much"

9590,"MY REVIEW:

Combat mechanics: 4/10 reason: It is very clunky, enemies phase through objects sometimes and start flying even


Scare factor: 10/10.  Only 17% of players have completed the game. That should say something.

Sound design: 10/10. The games sound design is immaculate and adds very well to the scare factor of the game

Music: 10/10. Very well designed and exciting music

Grind: Quite a lot of grinding. I beat the game in just over 24 hours straight with a friend and most of it was just grinding.


Ending: 10/10 ending left me discombobulated and wanting to know more



Graphics: Really good for a game released in 2014


Computer: Potato, nearly any computer can run it 



Should you get it? Yes, if it's on sale or just for full price.

Overall rating- 9.5/10"

9626,"If you've played ARK or Valheim or other survival-craft-build games, and you have some tolerance for creepy things, highly recommend. The UI design for inventory & crafting is obscure when you start, but it's a really cool and immersive concept that you get used to. Janky at times, but fun! Especially in co-op."
9627,good game get it now
9628,Don't play this game in front of your parents
9629,Horrifying in single player. Hilarious in multiplayer. Immersive and challenging either way. This and Green Hell are tied for my favorite realistic survival game.

9675,"I finished the Forest on the Ps5 console Version, and I gotta say, I loved this game, There isn't much of a Story, it being told through Pages of Art, Posters, and titbits here and there throughout the caves. The Story requires Exploration of all the caves to be told properly. Best Recommendation, Put Markers at the exits and Entrances to each Cave, each with a colour. It will help you keep track of each location and where you end up. Especially if you forget something, The combat is fluid, interesting and requires some practise to be actually good at. You will however die if your not careful, smart and well equipped in the caves. Should you make it to the end of the Game, you'll be provided with a choice, Leave the World and Experience the Ending, or Go back and live out the rest of the game trying to survive against increasingly harder enemies. Choice is yours. However I have seen heaps of Bases built to handle all the elements and foes you meet, I would recommend Picking this Up when its on Sale though as the Price on Steam is horrendous."
9676,"squid looking mfs are too strong
"
9677,"the best survival game even the game is old but still intense
"
9678,Most fun I've had in ages
9679,The Forecast Is a asymmetrical horror game where a 4v1 deathmatch takes place. The survivors have to repair 5 generators and escape and kill each other. While the killer had to kill every other survivor and hook them on a meat hook. This game gives me aids on testosterone Jesus Raptor what the fuck...
9680,"Can't wait for the 2nd game
"

9722,"I am a 45 yo father, probably one of the oldest people playing this game. I am a single farther to my Son, who is 14 now. My son got this game for Christmas in 2021 from his uncle, so we installed it on his computer and he started playing. By the end of the week he had 24 hours on this game. This was horrible for me, as it was already hard for me to find ways to spend time with my son, as he is always out with his friends or just watching YouTube. So I decided to make a Steam account and get this game to see if I could maybe play alongside him. I loaded into the game, picked my character and started playing but I was stuck on what you where supposed to do. I asked my Son for help and he hosted a game for me to join. I loved it as it was the best time I had spent with my Son since my wife had died. This game has ever since brought me and my son closer again and now we actually spend time together outside the house together as well. This game reminded me that there's fun to be had in everything, and it has brought both me and my Son many happy memories."
9723,"This game is an absolute blast to play with friends, a little buggy at times but nothing damaging mostly just good fun. Highly recommend."
9724,"Game is meh, look at this instead.

9759,"The Forest... Once a little Rock besides Top-Sellers like Minecraft, now the best Vr-Mmo-Strategie-Tarkovlike-Fps-Cyberpunk-SurvivalRPG-...Vr-Game you can get your hands on. For me primarly the insane amount of fire-arms have done enough to impress me. The Mutliplayer-Battleroyal like Gameplay makes it even more awesome to play. Also, the story is a masterpiece. When I lost my partner to those pesky terrorists at the beginning of the game, I exploaded in tears. For me easily the best Old-School-Clasic you can experience, even the comic like graphics didn't stop me from loving this game. The only down-side of the game are the long loading-screens when joining a raid. But still, buy it..."

9793,"The survival aspects could be interesting but unfortunately they lean more towards tedious instead of rewarding.  After getting swarmed by cannibals on the fifth day, dragged to a cave I couldn't find my way out of and got swarmed once more, I found I just wasn't interested in continuing to play.  I could have figured it out, but... I just didn't want to."

9797,"I've been playing this since it was so early access you couldn't even make spears, you had to find them on the map. My biggest and onlyest complaint about this game is that is has essentially ruined co-op survival games for me and my friends. This is best we've found. You spawn together, you work together, you build  together, you survive together. The survival is great, especially in the hardest difficulty, the enemies are interesting without going to far into Left 4 Dead territory, and the building is fantastic. We've tried to find other games like this one, but they all fall short. Or spawn so far away from each other that we have to spend the first 2 hours finding each other on the map, which is just 2 hours we've could have been using to play something else."

Edit: The game is really short, but its good. Just dont expect a long adventure. Feels like there should be more islands. Wouldn't pay more then $5 for it."

9830,"This game saved my life.

I am 27.

My ex-wife and I have a daughter together, and adopted our son together. They are now both 4 years old.

When we were going through our separation, I found myself lost and miserable. I was self destructive. I got so mad one day from everything spiraling out of my control that I punched some concrete in a moment of overwhelming emotion. That caused me to break my 5th metacarpal in my right hand... my working hand... my games hand.. the hand that I held and carried my children to bed with.. The hand I desperately needed to make sure I could continue to provide.

After learning of the severity of my self-inflicted damage, I was borderline suicidal. Keep in mind that just a few months before this, I was the happiest man with no history of depression or anxiety. I have never had fits of rage, or been one to break down and cry, but I was in a low spot that just really buried me from being able to see the light on the other side.

Having nothing better to do, I searched for a game I could play, ONE HANDED while I recovered. I somehow stumbled upon this game and read some of the reviews. I decided that it had to be worth a shot... I must admit, I didn't beat the game, or play nearly as long as some of you. In fact, I may have only played this game a day or two.. With that being said, after doing so, I had a new found joy and hope for life. I was able to put behind me the pain and suffering that had been cast over me. I was able to experience other peoples joy and happiness. I was able to see the fruits of my ""labor"". I relaxed for 5 ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•ing minutes to this music long enough to realize that I was going to be okay.

After coming to that realization, I turned the game off, and I went back to work. It hurt my hand like hell but I was motivated. I stopped feeling so damn sorry for myself, and I became the father I needed to be in that moment, not the weak boy I was behaving as.

Today, I am close friend with my kids mother. We don't fight, or argue, or say hurtful things to each other. We are parents, and friends.

I now have 3 kids. My third child is, wait for it, ALSO 4 YEARS OLD. The woman I am with was going through a very similar situation at the time of my own separation, and we just stumbled in to each others life unexpectedly. We have been in a relationship for a year now, and are very happy together.

Moral of the story, you never know what life holds in store for you, and if I would have given up when all the odds were stacked against me, I wouldn't be where I am today. This silly little game helped me realize that.

Thank you"

"
9856,This game is very fun to play with friends and definitely worth buying. The one thing I wish I had done though was build and explore more. You are able to complete the game without much exploration or progression. Great game overall and I am excited for sons of the forest
9857,The forest
9858,"if a ""difficult"" game means needlessly punishing mechanics for losing any kind of fight, sure. Get jumped by 4 guys moving like they are on crack in the first cave, okay whatever. But spawning with no food in the stomach and no energy or even an axe to fight the mini army hunting you down from said cave? Why, just why give you less than nothing on revive and leave enemies still hunting you?

its not often I can get softlocked in a survival game in less than 2 hours by following the games natural exploration... not looking forward to more of that happening. ill try a different walking simulator to pick up my backpack, thanks"
9859,yes
9860,Having a good time so far. I like the lack of directions/instructions and makes discovering how to make or do something more satisfying.
9861,There are naked men and women. I cut their heads off.
9862,All good
9863,This game is fun--but difficult. it takes a lot of time to farm resources and the story is somewhat confusing which is a bit more realistic because there isnt a lot of guidance in game of how to progress the story.

9956,"My name is Walter Hartwell White. I live at 308 Negra Arroyo Lane, Albuquerque, New Mexico, 87104. This is my confession. If you're watching this tape, I'm probably dead, murdered by my brother-in-law Hank Schrader. Hank has been building a meth empire for over a year now and using me as his chemist. Shortly after my 50th birthday, Hank came to me with a rather, shocking proposition. He asked that I use my chemistry knowledge to cook methamphetamine, which he would then sell using his connections in the drug world. Connections that he made through his career with the DEA. I was... astounded, I... I always thought that Hank was a very moral man and I was... thrown, confused, but I was also particularly vulnerable at the time, something he knew and took advantage of. I was reeling from a cancer diagnosis that was poised to bankrupt my family. Hank took me on a ride along, and showed me just how much money even a small meth operation could make. And I was weak. I didn't want my family to go into financial ruin so I agreed. Every day, I think back at that moment with regret. I quickly realized that I was in way over my head, and Hank had a partner, a man named Gustavo Fring, a businessman. Hank essentially sold me into servitude to this man, and when I tried to quit, Fring threatened my family. I didn't know where to turn. Eventually, Hank and Fring had a falling out. From what I can gather, Hank was always pushing for a greater share of the business, to which Fring flatly refused to give him, and things escalated. Fring was able to arrange, uh I guess I guess you call it a ""hit"" on my brother-in-law, and failed, but Hank was seriously injured, and I wound up paying his medical bills which amounted to a little over $177,000. Upon recovery, Hank was bent on revenge, working with a man named Hector Salamanca, he plotted to kill Fring, and did so. In fact, the bomb that he used was built by me, and he gave me no option in it. I have often contemplated suicide, but I'm a coward. I wanted to go to the police, but I was frightened. Hank had risen in the ranks to become the head of the Albuquerque DEA, and about that time, to keep me in line, he took my children from me. For 3 months he kept them. My wife, who up until that point, had no idea of my criminal activities, was horrified to learn what I had done, why Hank had taken our children. We were scared. I was in Hell, I hated myself for what I had brought upon my family. Recently, I tried once again to quit, to end this nightmare, and in response, he gave me this. I can't take this anymore. I live in fear every day that Hank will kill me, or worse, hurt my family. I... All I could think to do was to make this video in hope that the world will finally see this man, for what he really is."

9999,Maybe it's just me but I didn't like the forest. I tried playing it on vr and because it just threw me straight in I had and still have no idea what controls do what. I literally picked up an axe and I can't figure out how to get it out of my hand. Also there's no starting objective like chopping a tree or showing you the basics. No hate to the creators they've made a wonderful game but if you're looking to play it on vr I wouldn't recommend. Although I've only played it for 30 minutes so maybe if I took more time to it would've been more fun.
10000,"Pretty solid survival-craft game. Leans more horror than others. Early game feels like you're mostly chopping trees and hauling logs, but once you get a decent setup you get to focus on exploring the island. 

Unlike some other survival games, you know how to build everything you can build out of the gate, so you just have to figure out the best way to acquire said resources and hunt animals while also fending off the occasional cannibal. While its not listed out like your survival book, mousing over the gear icon in your craft mat will show you a list of things you can make with what you put on the mat. You book is for all placed structures; your mat is for tools, armor, weapons and herbs.

Good survival fix overall, better with friends, looking forward to the sequel."

10005,"Incredible game, full of atmosphere, quite spooky in places and I did jump a few times when lost in a cave. Completed the 'story' but I'm continuing to have fun due to the excellent survival aspect of the game.

Crafting is never a chore, its not overblown and is relatively straight forward. There is definitely an aspect of 'put in the effort and you get the rewards' when it comes to base building though, which I loved. 

On the whole, an amazing game for an amazing price, I'm now looking forward to see what this studio has coming next. EDIT: I've just seen what this studio has coming next and it looks awesome!"

10067,"Don't buy this game.

Let's start with what I like: 
-great atmosphere
-sound design
-theme
-enemy design

What I dislike:
-everything else.

Building in this game is utterly atrocious, I've never seen a building system worse than this. To start with - any building is incredibly grindy. Most take 10-30 minutes of chopping and hauling logs to your base in order to build. I'm not opposed to grind in my survival games, but this is a horrible problem when...

You have no way to move buildings or adjust them after placement. Want to ""dismantle"" your new log cabin because the door is bugged and won't open? Your zipline is remotely near the ground and kicks you off if you ever try to use it? Placed a locked door backwards accidentally and just need to flip it? Sorry, no, you have to destroy it. The final punchline is that you get back NONE of the materials used to build it. It's incredibly easy to accidentally break parts of your base.

Let's say you want to put up with the grind and the tedium of building. Sure, build a zipline to more easily ferry logs to your base. The problem is that whenever you try to send more than 2 logs down a zipline, the physics engine breaks and they all explode into literal oblivion.

Okay, so this is rough you say, surely it's better with mods. Yeah, it can be, however, most mods do not work in multiplayer. There are mods to reduce building costs, to make placing buildings better, to make transporting logs easier, but none of these work on dedicated servers.

Speaking of multiplayer. Heaven forbid you want to actually play with other people, because this game really does not want you to. Want to give an item to another player? There is only one way to ""trade"" items. You need to combine the item in your crafting menu with a metal tray. Then you need to hold out the tray for the other player to interact with. This metal tray, by the way, is in the back of the plane when you start and is easily missed. Nowhere in the game tells you this. For some unfathomable reason there is no way to ""drop"" items (unless you count useless ones like rotten food).

The game is just filled with all of these half-baked half-assed workarounds and concepts that just go nowhere. For example, there's a sanity system that drops over time. Sounds scary, right? Well, it does nothing, except unlock some crafted furniture.

""So just play singleplayer,"" you say. Sure. Today I logged into my personal save and discovered all of my progress is somehow gone - my character's inventory remains, but the base that I took about 10 hours building is just gone for 0 reason.

Seriously, screw this game. It's an Early Access game that has never been finished, and now they're making a sequel. I've played half a dozen survival games that were way more polished at their Early Access/Alpha launch than this game has with years of ""polish"". I could go on and on about the baffling design decisions these people made. Ultimately this ""game"" just reminds me of school projects I did as a child and was way too lazy to finish properly and just did the laziest workarounds possible."

i am a 45 yo father, probably one of the oldest people playing this game. I am a single farther to my Son, who is 14 now. My son got this game for Christmas from his uncle, so we installed it on his computer and he started playing. By the end of the week he had 24 hours on this game. This was horrible for me, as it was already hard for me to find ways to spend time with my son, as he is always out with his friends or just, watching YouTube. So i decided to make a Steam account and get this game to see if I could maybe play alongside him. loaded into the game, made my character and world and started playing but I was stuck on what you where supposed to do. I asked my Son for help and he hosted a game for me to join. loved it as it was the best time had spent with my Son since my wife had died. This game has ever since brought me and my son closer again and now we actually spend time together outside the house together as well. This game reminded me that there's fun to be had in everything, and it has brought both me and my Son many happy memories."

10184,Atmospheric/Scary. a must buy game if you haven't check it out already.
10185,"its very good
"
10186,"would appreciate a tutorial at the start of the game to get familiarized with the ui, had to do some google searches for that, but apart from that, its very fun with friends, cant say as to the single player experience though. Slight bug encountered where in multiplayer I see say a corpse on one spot while the other player sees it in a slightly different spot. Nothing game breaking though, feels very fun and I got it on sale so It's very good for its price even while not on sale. also i like to chop off limbs. so the people become just flopping torsos."

10199,"This is by far the worst ""mainstream"" open world survival crafting game on the market currently.  ARK has a reputation for being broken and glitchy but this is even worse.  Me and my friend absolutely love this genre but we couldn't play more than 6 hours before we gave up.  I kept getting randomly booted back to the title screen while we were playing, with none of my progress saved.  This game had so many things that bugged us but we kept going because this genre is typically pretty clunky, but that was the final straw.  

I noticed that a lot of what this game has was implemented in another Open World Survival Crafting game, Grounded.  Except EVERYTHING this game brought to the genre, Grounded did a thousand times better.  Typically I don't like comparing two games just because they're similar, but grounded really is the better version of The Forest. The only thing this game has that grounded doesn't is a ""horror"" setting.  But really, this game isn't scary at all so it fails at even that."

10216,So long as you aren't at risk of a heart attack I would recommend.
10217,i eat people yummy
10218,"Free-form survival horror with some surprising dynamic systems.

Aside from gripes about a general lack of support over the life cycle of this game, it's a worthwhile game in the genre with an ample building and crafting system, reasonable survival needs, and a dynamic but ever present threat.  The aspect of exploring the island to gather specific components/tools as a form of progression makes it akin to an old adventure game.  The actual base building elements are arguably a little pointless but this depends on how you want to play the game.

Co-op and VR capability especially make it stand out.  Not many VR games are nearly as fleshed out as actual games, so this title working well in VR makes it particularly a major title in the VR market despite being an older game."

10238,"Quite possibly one of the greatest survival horror games ever made. The atmosphere, tone and tension are consistent and very well established. A tad buggy at times and with a fairly basic crafting / building system, but  solid in it's approach to horror. There is something in this game for everyone and I am buzzing for the sequel later this year. This game is a must buy."

This game is a large open world survival game that you can play by yourself or with friends highly recommended.  You can explore the large map, explore caves which are highly dangerous places but offer great items and more story lore, or build bases to survive from the enemies.  This game is also great in VR.  A few bugs here and their.  When you die you loose everything except if your turn on cheats.  All in all a must play for those who love survival games."

I really loved The Forest, but it's definitely not for everyone. The dark story and violent gameplay can turn many people away, but people who love that will enjoy polished gameplay and heart-pounding moments.
If you decide to play alone, you‚Äôll be much more anxious, scared, and lonely. Exploring the huge network of caves alone is a daunting task, and building a base is much more difficult with one person.

10335,"Survival aspects are meh at best. Building feels dull and tedious. Combat is heavy and unrewarding. Cave exploring is near impossible without already knowing the caves. The bosses are easily killed sometimes and others they one shot you. Armour does not give you its durability, only that it is equipped. The story is not pushed or told in a way to get you drawn in and the end game is sub par and uneventful.

3/10 at best."
10336,"A boring survival game whose horror and stress relies on not being able to see in the caves, making it so you cannot tell if there are threats out there. Once the threats appear and you are able to fight them off, the game loses all scares. The combat is janky and poorly balanced due to relying on mechanics designed around survival (axe swings meant for chopping down trees, not fighting). Story is uninteresting, final boss is a poorly designed joke unless you have one of two long ranged weapons, at which point it becomes a boring slog."

At first thought it was just another generic survival game, but this game is the definition of the iceberg meme. It's fun, scary, atmospheric with a great story, and isn't just a sloppy VR port. 10/10 worth the buy, especially if you have a VR"
10344,"Even in 2022, the game is a buggy mess. I spent 2 hours building a base with my friends for it to glitch out and be made useless. On top of that, 2 of my friends lost a months worth of inventory due to the game crashing. The enemies randomly stop spawning altogether in some areas making the game extremely boring and useless. The enemies are all the same, nothing unique to them. The story is vague, map is massive, empty and repetitive. I'd stay away and hope that Son of the forest is somewhat better than this crap."

10379,"This game is 100% the greatest open world survival game you will ever play. The first experience of playing along with the story, finding your son and all the other things that come with, is by far the greatest thing I've personally experienced in a video game. This game has came along ways from when it was released, from fixing bugs, glitches, and adding various items to the game to make its potential as high as it can possibly be. This is and will always be my favorite game of all time. Looking forward to playing the new sons of the forest this fall."

10388,"Scary, good crafting, good survival, not too difficult. Overall good game"
10389,this game is soo much fun too play me and my firend played this all the time and there are some scary monsters and u really have too survive all the nights (and days) to survive. You also have to go on adventures to find stuff like a katana or ex chainsaw. BIG recomend by me.

10398,"Honestly one of the best games to play with your friends on the entire Steam platform. If you're wondering whether you should buy this game I can only tell you one thing: Buy it or regret it.

Just make sure not to get kocaked by one of your friends"
10399,This game is really fun and i think anyone should get it. But if anyone does not like to be scared you should not get it.
10400,Very good game

The atmosphere of the game itself is at the top, specially when you are exploring unknown. However it sometimes gets annoying and monotonic with all those villages.

10413,"The Forest is atmospheric, with jump scares a plenty. Enemies are tough, the caves daunting & they just keep coming! Cannibal mode isn't for everyone & thoughtfully (good job devs) can be toggled on/off so The Forest becomes an entirely different experience of craft, build & hunting. 
This is only the second game to fill me with dread & create a well of anxiety, (Generation Zero) the true making of this game. Love it! 
Whatever floats your boat, be it craft & build or ultimate cannibal destruction The Forest will not disappoint."
10414,no  child?
10415,I don't often get scared from games but the atmosphere built up for unnerving encounters especially early game! :D
10416,it is an amazing experience and ofc nothing is perfect and would recommend play it with friends
10417,honestly this is the most relaxing game I've ever played. I absolutely love building a fort and hunting cannibals.

- Graphics is beautiful.

- The survival system is punishing just enough to make the game fun, but not make it too hard or monotonous.
What I don't like:
- Can be a little too overwhelming playing alone
- Online guide is my friend.
All in all, I would give this an ""awesome"", a classic in its genre of survival crafting game."

10486,great game 10/10 would play again. good story line and yea. megan sucks. she an op i hate her
10487,"The Forest starts off like the first episode of Lost, where you crash-land on an airplane in an uncharted setting with no technology. I have to admit, for as brief a cinematic as it was, the plane crash is a thrill and reminiscent of how Bioshock kicked off. Once you come to, you and your friends have free reign to navigate the island and do everything it takes to survive. You‚Äôll immediately find this is easier said than done, as you encounter your first batch of other humans.

The enemies in The Forest are tribal warriors that will demolish you if you‚Äôre not careful. They vary from intelligent survivalists to frantic savages, to abhorrent monstrosities. Other than the ax you are given from the plane, you can also craft spears for fast attacks, bows for enemies far away, and even set your foes ablaze with a combination of your lighter and a can of hairspray. Enemies tend to fight in packs, so it‚Äôs paramount that you and your friends work together to dispatch them.

The main attraction of The Forest is ironically not the areas within the trees but instead, the massive caves spread across the island. You‚Äôll find key items in these dark, expansive areas, like flashlights, chainsaws, and climbing tools for cragged rock. Past this, you‚Äôll need to manage your hunger, thirst, and body temperature. Sometimes the best food available is the tribal warrior you just killed, making cannibalism seem like a normality for survival. Morality is truly out the window in this game.

For sanctuary, you can build a nice shelter with the resources scattered about your surroundings. Chopping down trees feels great, watching them fall with great physics and a subtle creaking sound as it plummets to the ground. Once your housing is built, you can save your progress. Unfortunately, I did encounter a universal crash and lost 30+ minutes of progress at one point, so an autosave feature upon entering/exiting caves would be welcome instead of the ear-splitting bats.

In the survival game landscape, I‚Äôd still put The Forest very high on the list of quality, as the game clearly benefitted from its long development time and player input. It‚Äôs always great to see a game emerge from Early Access and earn Overwhelmingly Positive reviews on Steam. If you have a group to play with, it‚Äôs easy to recommend The Forest at this point, even several years after its initial popularity, as it‚Äôs been a blast for me so far!"
10488,Cant wait for Son's of the Forest
10489,The game is so much fun but i get lost and forget there is a story. The story is. A little harder to follow on multiplayer

10510,"This is a survival game for people who like a scary atmosphere, an interesting story, and to build stuff. The entire game could be blitzed through in one sitting, but you'll definitely enjoy it the most if you take it slow and invite along a group of friends. There are caves to explore, a handful of notable enemies to encounter, and lots of ways to die. You choose the difficulty as you see fit. 

Overall, I was impressed by how non-obtrusive yet intriguing the story was. I'm the type who almost always ignores the story in the games I play. (I generally want to get straight to the action.) But the subtle ways it was incorporated into the game play in The Forest had me interested, and when I finally decided to pursue the ending, I found myself pretty happy with the way it played out. It was nothing groundbreaking, but I enjoyed it.

I would say, though, that the main draw of this game is definitely the building. It's pretty neat to see your base gradually take shape, and to go from being the one hunted to being the hunter as enemies run straight into your traps. (At which point you generally proceed to burn their bodies and use their bones for furniture or armor, but I digress.)"
10511,Looking forward to the forest 2
10512,"its very interesting,wouldnt say its fun for just singleplayer unless u know,ur like that, but its extrmely fun with co-op"
10513,"While the game is fun for the first few hours of learning the crafting and survival basics, the map is too big for objectives that are too vague on location. Once I learned all the things I would be going around with my group of friends who bought it with me to find, we all just uninstalled and moved on. It's hard enough to go a hundred feet from your safety area let alone cross the size of this map and stay alive when you're just wandering hoping to find the right object or poi.

The building and survival mechanics would be great for 100+ player online survival servers though. Something that has base raiding and maybe even vehicles. You could even keep the mutants in the game for fun but maybe they don't destroy hard earned bases.. leave that for the players to dispute."
10514,"Though very fun, it's hard to create a structurally sound base (at least it was for me) mostly due to the fact that everything is made of wood and the boss tanks it down. Though I haven't played for long but I hope to see some other form of construction to use. :) Overall a well made game, 8/10 would recommend if your into people hunting you."
10515,lots of trees...
10516,i dream of cannibals every time i play this
10517,"Love this game the graphics 10/10 game-play 10/10 overall the game is a solid 11/10!!

10523,"very epic
"
10524,"Fun game you can play by yourself or with some friends. The atmosphere of The Forest gets really intense when playing solo but can be a real comedy when joined by some friends. The building system seems pretty simple but you can make some cool fortresses if you put some time into it. The combat is also fun with enemies being able to dodge arrows if far enough away and they tend to run in groups. I haven't gotten far in story or exploring but it seems intriguing. All around I would give it a 9/10. The only issue is small bugs like a tree stump not being a physical entity, so now I have one stump that is apparently just for decoration purposes. Other minor things like audio stutters (very rare) and eating things when trying to pick them up (Like a rock for instances). Definitely would recommend."

The enemies  dodge so fast to the side it looks like they are teleporting you cant hit them with the slow ""plane axe"" you start with. This could be an amazing game but the crafting and inventory, i cant explain how stupid it is, youre supposed to guess what you can craft with what you have and thats impossible. there is no inventory, theres no hotkeys 1-10.  apart from the good graphics, i have to give it a very bad review"

10630,"each player from your multiplayer-session has to be there everytime you want to play this specific save file, else they will lose every progress because their characters are ""out of sync"" and they have to begin from a new.

i don't know how some shitty multiplayer connection programming method from the 2000s is still around in 2018 and still not fixed in 2022.. but yeah.



wouldn't recommend if wanting to play one save file with and without friends."
10631,"This game was gifted to me by a friend who didn't know I don't enjoy games like [i]Rust[/i] or [i]Conan: Exiles[/i]. Even though I love the game mechanics in those open world games, the multiplayer game play devolves into a lulz fest.  That's fun for about hour but then I need something more satisfying than crushing your enemies, driving them before you, and hearing the lamentations of the women. Heresy. I know.

I played multiplayer only with 2 friends. We chose not to read anything on the game (unless stuck) and agreed to the shared experience of the unfolding story. The game play became stronger as we cooperated more. Sharing deeply satisfying triumphs of survival. Genuine ""wtf holy hell"" moments at some of the environments especially when played on a late model graphics card. We just finished it last night and...we were speechless.

The thing this game does differently than the other open world games I played is that [i]The Forest[/i] gives you a engaging narrative. A long story arc that gives you reasons to push the game mechanics in creative ways. It's not just a singular story arc either. What defines your favored experience within an open world game system end up being a foil to the story arc of [i]The Forest[/i].

Highly recommended. Arguably one of the best gaming experiences this old gamer has ever had."

10641,"This is one of the best games that I've played, even though its just a game it feels so real when you see the cannibals attack you because they get scared after you kill others in front of them, I also like how if your lucky you can see them make effagies. Although some things are super realistic and cool to see there is some glitches that should have been fixed like how sometimes when fighting a cannibal it doesn't register that you hit them which is pretty annoying, overall this game is amazing!"

10662,"This is the most fun game in the Horror / Survival genre that I ever played, though I can't say I played anything  quite like this before.  The Forest actually gives me shivers and makes me jump in my seat occasionally.  Base building is fun and important to survival.  The cannibals are smart, fast, and hard to kill.  The game developers did a very admirable job on this game.  It is very deep, but it easy enough to learn but is still challenging to beginners on ""normal"" mode.  Fun!"

10712,Good. Fun. Adventure. Gotta figure out some things and stick with it for a while.
10713,"I am a 45 yo father, probably one of the oldest people playing this game. I am a single farther to my Son, who is 14 now. My son got this game for Christmas from his uncle, so we installed it on his computer and he started playing. By the end of the week he had 24 hours on this game. This was horrible for me, as it was already hard for me to find ways to spend time with my son, as he is always out with his friends or just, watching YouTube. So i decided to make a Steam account and get this game to see if I could maybe play alongside him. loaded into the game, made my character and world and started playing but I was stuck on what you where supposed to do. I asked my Son for help and he hosted a game for me to join. loved it as it was the best time had spent with my Son since my wife had died. This game has ever since brought me and my son closer again and now we actually spend time together outside the house together as well. This game reminded me that there's fun to be had in everything, and it has brought both me and my Son many happy memories."
10714,"I is super awesome, almost like a more realistic minecraft. Would totally recommend"
10715,"Great game! They did an awesome job with the horror elements, exploration and combat are done quite well. 

Building is super fun, can be a bit wonky sometimes depending what your doing but overall really fun to be creative with! I'm fairly picky, but really do recommend giving this game a good playthrough!

Xbox Controller works quite well with it which I was very happy to see as well!"

10769,yes
10770,"I would say I really like the way that they mixed horror with survival because you aren't just trying to survive hunger and dehydration, but also the waves of cannibals and mutants. I would say the horror is not just the fear of being hunted, but also when you are captured and have to escape, it feels hopeless, with just a lighter and maybe a torch trying to traverse endless caves with grotesque being attacking you from out of nowhere."

10780,"This by far one of the greatest games ever created
i was a man suffering from stage 4 cancer however the lore and beauty of this game cured me. The graphics of this game exceeds games such as ark while using a fraction of the memory. i can not wait for sons of the forest. i fall asleep to the soundtrack of the forest and i have breakfast everyday while watching the sons of the forest game trailer. This game saved my life on multiple occasions. If someone where to call this game bad i would break their spinal cord and use their eyeballs as joysticks to play the forest. the forest is my love. if the forest has 1000000 fans im one of them. if the forest has 1000 fans im one of them. if the forest has 10 fans im one of them. if the forest has 0 fans i am dead. 

One side effect of playing this game is development of mental diseases such as schizophrenia and split personality disease. However even the shadowy figures me and my other 4 personalities see at night agree that the forest is a must play."

10807,"Unnecessary and annoying mix of game mechanics that is clearly not dial in. Awful field of view, terrible weapon reach, ridiculous differences in game mode, pathetic illumination and artificial noise with no surround sound! Immersion breaking glitches, objects loading mid-air down to the ground, shadows move incrementally, birds fly at night, birds will flock to you and aggressive wildlife will attack no one else but you. Right hand wielding bow like with your other weapons because your magical BIC lighter, torch light and compass can only be held with your left and one at a time too, which means a constant switching to see what you are heading to or where you are heading to, and turning off and on the lights when loading your gun or when drawing your bow.

10808,Great game! A survival game that has a story line. You can either just ignore the story line and build a cool base with heaps of traps or you can grind out the suuppper interesting storyline. Trying to work out what happened on the island that you have crashed on. Would highly recommend!
10809,I apologize for all previous reviews I've ever made. I was taking an extra birth control pill. I'm sorry
10810,Shit game. Minecraft ripoff. Totally non user-friendly
10811,immersive multi player horror game
10812,"solid game, very polished gameplay and has really unsettling cave exploration during your first playthrough, also the vr is very nice for a non-vr centered game"

10815,good
10816,"[b]The Forest Review:[/b] I'm reviewing this from a VR perspective as its's how I mainly play the game with friends. We've been hooked on the game all over again, played it before and it was an awesome game. Now I finally have it in VR thanks to my friend gifting me the game & I have to say that it's super scary. We've been working on our base for days and built over a large area and began journeying further out for resources and caves. I tell you that there is no scarier feeling than having cannibals scout your base only to return at night in large numbers to attack you and your friends, several days later we started hearing roars around the base outside our walls and that's when we realized that mutants were waiting for us outside so we started setting traps outside our base in order to fend them off. 

I tell you that the feeling of dread hits you as soon as you're surrounded. It's really a survival game, you have to drink, eat,  build & scavenge in order to obtain materials. The bigger things are the caves, that's where the main story stuff is at but going into caves is risky business if you go under equipped. We literally were chased out of a cave by mutants and skinny cannibals with our backs to the walls swinging our clubs like maniacs. Very much worth the purchase and even more if you're playing it in VR."

The game kind of drip-feeds you the story until the very end. I didn't find the story to be particularly compelling. The crafting/survival aspects are what really pleased me with this game.

A good crafting survival game. Not something you can sink hundreds of hours into like 7 Days to Die, but definitely worth a buy. There is only one static map so there isn't really any replay value like with games that have random world generation."

Definitely an enjoyable game, whilst I struggled a bit at first, once you get going, it's so much fun, the physics are amazing and the Tutorial/Stats/Knowledge system is very different to most other games of it's kind but I would personally say that it is a more engaging complex"

10955,Good survival game with planner build and character play with multiplayer in missions.

Mediocre, you actually don't need to build shit, just grab the main story items, a spear and learn how to build armor.
you will need to adjust the brightness because is ridiculous the sources of light you can get or build.

Items get stuck into the environment, player models flies into the sky from colliding with rocks. The base building part of the game is just silly and seems nonsense. This game could be better but not in this form. A good idea with bad implementation.

Very joyfull game, I bought it on discount but its still worth the money. It's perfect for multiplayer, I spend most of my time in the pandemic with this game. There are lots of hidden tresures and caves. Easy mechanics I reccomend"
11008,Great with friends!
11009,Best game ever.
11010,"I didn't like this as much as similar survival games.  The problem is when you build a base, the cannibals constantly attack you.  It's not super challenging to fight them off, just annoying.  I don't mind getting raided every now and then, but getting attacked 2-3 times a day and then again at night just gets tedious.  You spend ALL your time fighting cannibals not building or exploring.  Additionally, your base defensive options are somewhat limited to a few traps and walls so you can't really automate your defenses much.  Effigies meant to ward off cannibals actually attract them!  I've read that there are ways to get around this like not building a large base (why make this an option in your game if you penalize it?), avoiding having fires at night (you know, when you need them because it's dark), avoiding their patrol routes (how would you even know where those routes are?), or moving your base, but that's pretty tedious and there's no real in game way to determine where your base will get attacked frequently.  Compare to, say, Valheim which had limited base raids, and far superior building mechanics, this is inferior in every way.  Or Subnautica with solid base building and amazing exploration.  It's too bad too, because the core gampelay actually is pretty decent.  As the devs left it (and they left it long ago), it's not a survival game it's a base defense game with very limited base defense options."
11011,the controls are a bit weird but everything else is amazing the graphics its a bit slow for vr but turning down graphics made it much better recommend this game if you like survival multiplayer games.

11020,"One of the best games I've ever played. Words cannot describe how fun this game is, let alone playing with your friends. 

If you don't have this game yet, buy it, NOW. Discount or not, the price from it is well worth it.

At first, I didn't know what to do in this game because there were so many things I didn't know. But after a few hours of playing, I became addicted.

The rating of the game that I will give is... 10/10.

No doubt."
11021,its so good
11022,"playing on your own is boring and stressful, and if your sense of direction is bad like mine then you'll never want to go exploring to find the caves you need to complete to get to any ending in the story.

playing with friends is one of the best experiences in existence. making a cute little house with your friends, hearing a friend saying theyre going to grab more sticks before they start screaming, followed by ""so. you'll never guess what just happened."" as they run back to camp from the airplane. ganging up on cannibals together and telling them to ""fight back, fight back!"" only to retreat when 6 more show up and outnumber you 2:1. holding the head of a squirrel around camp and telling everyone to look at what you've got. this games multiplayer is impossibly fun- in fact, it's so fun that when the game was too much for some of my friends computers to run, we spent a year without playing despite spending every month going ""man i wish we could play the forest again."" it is even so fun that my friend actually said ""im saving money so i can get a new laptop to play the forest."" not a new laptop so they could do more work or play more games in general, but get a new laptop so they can play the forest specifically. it is that fun. 

friends and i currently have built in the perfect place, close enough to the plane to make it there with enough daylight to spare. backed up to a cliff and surrounded by water on the other 3 sides so cannibals almost never cross into our area. far enough from the cannibal patrols to avoid detection normally, close enough to patrols to have a never-ending supply of cannibal bones. have we explored any caves whatsoever? no, my friends are all babies and are too scared to explore them with me, but i'm a bad fighter on my own and too impulsive so i cant be trusted to go on my own. are we still having fun while we figure out what we're best at in the game? yes- even our friend who is best at dying almost every in-game day is having fun. this is the best multiplayer survival horror game ever."

11059,"took me about 21 hours to beat the game with base building. i didnt collect every single weapon as there was no point i got the only ones you need to progress in caves. towards the end on (normal) playing solo the mobs werent a threat anymore. 
                 19.99 for 21 hours is a good deal i deff recommend."
11060,it is fun
11061,The Forest is a fun and captivating game with incredible scenary. the monsters in caves are horrifying and the adventure is incredible. endnight is an awsome company and this game was well worth the money. the building mechanics and the cannible AI are incredible as well. 11/10 would recomend to every man woman and child.
11062,"Easily the buggiest game I've played in a while. This is what's wrong with Early Access games ‚Äî they're buggy and unpolished messes and when the developers get tired of working on it they just slap a ""Full Release"" label on it without actually making it into a working game. I had to turn on developer mode just to get to the last boss without the game killing itself. 
I hope the sequel is better."
11063,"One of the best survival games ever made. This game is so well made it always surprises me when I come back to play it. The content is plenty and the gameplay is very fun and replayable. I hope the sequel can live up to the quality of this game, it probably will.

8/10

good game"
11089,"Great game.  Played single player.  This game legitimately scared me at times.  I loved the building, cannibal behavior, and freedom.  This game definitely doesn't hold your hand.  You are going to have to search for the story and key items without really any clues and the story won't make sense until the very end and maybe not even then.  
If you are having trouble progressing, get some hints on where to find the modern axe.  Once I found the axe, I was much more confident in the caves.  Also, don't walk past the compass several times without picking it up like I did."

11115,"It was ok game for somebody who likes surviving games with horrors.
I did not like caves till I got the artifact. Too dark, no good map. I had to rely heavily on youtube to get through the cave story (weapons, the story itself).
I hate John. I wish there was an option to switch it off. I tried to find a mod but mods are not supported through the steam workshop. So I have to reload saves every time John first time appears (5% chance). 
In spite of all that, I like the game and I will buy the son of forest. I hope it will have a better map option. It  will have better weapons and graphic for sure."

11135,ok
11136,"A solid horror survival game. The natives of the island can be a nuisance at times but generally speaking the game has decent enemy progression and at night time the sounds of the forest are up to the task of putting you on edge. Multiplayer is generally a good place to hang out with friends or with complete strangers if you'd prefer, griefers are a thing as with most games but they are a rarity and in most cases will be handled by the owner of the server. The atmosphere of the game is good and the flickering of the lighter is a nice touch especially when it goes out on you for a few seconds and you are left alone in the dark with only your thoughts and the distant footsteps swiftly approaching. Overall its a solid survival game that can be played by both horror game enthusiasts and Survivalists alike.

Rating: 7.5/10"
11137,"Played a few years ago, cleared, and just played recently

and i found almost nothing changed. 

still too much efforts needed to build a thing,
and especially crafting system is quite complicated - it can be a identity of this game, though -

I can't decide precisely it is recommendable or not, 
it is playable when the one thinks it is a game from years ago,
and It is non-playable when it is compared to the games from nowadays."

11145,"The Forest is a survival horror/crafting game set on an island with a bunch of mutant cannibals.

The reason why I am giving this a negative review is that I feel like the crafting the side of the game is under developed and the survival horror gameplay of the game wasn't really for me. In the end I quit about halfway through and don't really see myself picking it back up. Combine this with a couple of bad or at least unfun decisions and this game won't get a recommend from me.

The crafting and inventory system is very basic. You carry all resources you need (literally have a slot for each) and you never need workbenches or anything like that. You are encouraged to be a nomad. There are no rare resources or recipes to unlock, so there is no crafting progression. Basically the crafting system is there for you to figure out and then you are mostly done with it, only using it to quickly cobble together whatever you need at the moment. Your certainly CAN base build but there is no reward for it and most of the time it just hampers you.

The rest of the gameplay feels similarly basic. There are no RPG mechanics to buff skills or different abilities or a large variety of weapons, no, its just click to hit with either spear or club. Sure you dodge and block, but within 5 minutes you have figured out combat. Yes the late game enemies are more interesting to fight, so credit there, but I never felt that it rose to the level of engaging.

Really most of the game is spent in the very, very dark caves looking for items. That is how the game is progressed. And when I say dark, I mean obscenely dark. While I get the horror vibe they were going for and it does build a nice atmosphere, I had to turn up the brightness to max and change the color settings just so I wouldn't miss turns and get lost as much. Again, lost in the dark with cannibal monsters around is kind of good horror, but man was it not fun as it quickly got frustrating as I just wanted to know where to go. Not to mention that I was constantly afraid I was missing key items that I missed in the darkness, which is not the horror I think they were going for.

Speaking of the horror itself, that is the one good aspect of the game and what kept me going. The cannibals are monstrous sub-human freaks. They adorn themselves and their villages with severed and mutilated body parts. You will find grotesque totems of bound and contorted humans. And some of the late game enemies? Revolting. And great. They really instill a sense of dread in you, as you can really imagine that dying is much, much preferable to being captured by them. And even better, you can start resorting to cannibalism yourself becoming the very thing you are fighting against. Good, horrifying stuff.

There is no story here, not really, you are trying to find your son, so go kill cannibals till you do. There is SOME environmental story telling with notes and pictures around but it didn't really seem to add up to anything. The sound design and graphics are fine in my opinion, no complaints.

Last thing I do want to mention is that the colonialism optics here are not good. The cannibals are clearly sub-human, living in wooden huts, and doing things like cooking up missionaries to eat, and of course they kidnapped your son which justifies you, a white man, to slaughter them wholesale. That would be a yikes . Its basically the worst sterotypes that the colonial powers had about people they considered 'uncivilized'. Of course the distinction is that in this case the sterotypes are actually true, the island natives are not actually human (no genitals, able to run fast on all fours, seem to be incapable of complex speech, they really are needlessly violent). But the fact that this game plays into and gets so much mileage out of the 'jungle cannibal' trope is a bit gross. 

What this all adds up to is, that aside from the horror, there was almost nothing I liked about the game. I am clearly in the minority here, so I think other people got more out of the mechanics than I did, but for me, I would give this game a pass."

11197,"Another horrible adventure-craft with bad pacing and no clue what to do, expecting you to ""google everything"" like that's a great way to build software...no.   

Game starts, plane crash....immediately you have no water, and there's no way to find any, but of course it's gonna punish you for it.  So you have to google, why?  There's literally TWO way in the universe to get water (that is drinkable and not potentially harmful) when you start.  One is the find a ""pot"" which I've never found in multiple playthroughs, I'm not sure how far into the game you have to get to find it, but its' I guess RNG and nonsense to expect the player to have.  So...your best bet is....wait for it...a rain collector?  Yea, it works about as well as it sounds like it would.  I built it, and in 2 days I was ALREADY attacked several times but never got any water.  Fun.
Wanna build a base?   Yea, chop trees...that's cool, pretty standard right?  Oh, btw...it literally takes like 2 minutes to chop a tree.  By the time you get 7 logs for your ""first bed/sleep thingie"" you've wasted the whole first day, are tired, hungry, and thirsty.  Yea...I REALLY wanna play a base-builder when it's gonna take hours to chop down the trees for like, a couple foundations.

So, sticks and rocks, cool...other stuff you can build things with.  How many sticks can you carry? 10...how many rocks?  5....nope, not joking, like umm ok.  

Ok, killed a few animals, let's cook the meat!  Oh, you have to eat it all now?  You can't take it off the fire when its' done? Nope, eat it all now or it's gonna burn!  So, you'll waste all that unless you cook EXACTLY what you needed to eat in the moment.   

things harassing you around the base?  Less than 2 days?  you don't have walls, or traps, or any kind of protection by this point (see: how long it takes to chop trees above)...so uhh yea, the solution is ""find a body of water and run in it because the mobs can't swim""...yea, fun....I'll just sit here and do nothing while I wait for them to leave.  Oh, rain collector, still nothing?  cool...

Horrible, horrible building UI....yea limme dig through this book and click on tabs to find basic things like ""a firepit"" or ""a stone wall"" ....so slow.  Then you build something and it's never on a grid, so it'll never look ""neat""...yea, because people who place base-building games HATE neat and are NEVER OCD, right?  /s

Also, you don't even know what it'll cost until after you lay the ghost down....it just says ""infinity"" and then you build to an arbitrary length (no grid, snapping, anything...just a ""stretchy"" wall/platform/etc) and then it's like,oh btw that's 50 logs!    Oh, for this one platform?  You mean the things that take like 5 minutes to get a couple of?   And how long (real time) does the night last?  LONG....like, REALLY long.   

Oh, and trying to kill TINY animals with a clunky axe...yea, that's fun and not at all flakey.  Not that it matters, because water is the issue that'll stop you anyway.  Oh but don't worry, all the forest ""experts"" that know exactly where to go for pot spawns will tell you how silly you are for not immediately going to some random place and picking one up...

bleh...typical from devs that don't really understand how to make games, they just know how to throw a bunch of survival mechanics that have been done to death in a piece of software and sell it.  Making an actual GAME, fun, playable GAME is more than that!  

Also it's got all the typical ""scripted"" mechanics that survival/horror games have that feel so unnatural and punishing...like ""the bigger your base is, the bigger the randomly (unavoidable) spawns that will attack you are""...umm, why?  Are the cannibals breeding?   Do they go from baby to killer-beast in 3 days?  Why?  

In the end, it's the same with all these survival/horror games...and I mean LITERALLY the same game....you either say ""this is dumb"" or, you slug through a bunch of non-fun stuff, for hours or maybe days, just to get to a point (most of which will be spent googling) where you can do a playthrough and then bash people for not liking the beginning.   

Waste...looks fun from the YT videos, but those guys already did their suffering.  I refuse, and I won't recommend it to anyone else (also the UI feels like it's from 1997, why?)

11215,"The experience will make you jump out of your seat, make sure to bring another pair of pants, the horror comes unexpectedly and it will make your heart race. This is why I recommend this game 100% 10-10 developers, 10 out of 10."
11216,a great survival game to play in a group
11217,"So... The Forest eh? Ain't gonna lie, the game is pretty bad and boring beyond belief. A friend bought it for me as a gift and honestly, I'm sorry for his wasted money on this than anything else. I would drop this game if I wasn't playing it with my friend and atleast getting to talk to him while playing this below average, overrated game.

TLDR:
Story 3/10
Graphics 6,5/10 (bit dated)
Sound 9/10
Character design 8/10 (not the cutscenes, they looked horrible)
Survival 5/10
Gameplay 8/10 (no major complaints, apart from the bugs it was playable and understandable)
Fun 2/10
Pick this up if it's on sale for a really low price or don't bother, but if it does seem like the type of game you'd enjoy, go ahead.

[b] Lengthy review below: [/b]
So, to me, the reason you'd buy this game is mainly the survival and horror-like genre and the exploration of the island, mainly the caves. Was it scary at times? Maybe, but not really? I mostly laughed rather than got scared, because the enemies getting stuck on terrain, flying up in the air and weird animations were hilarious. Survival is ok, I guess? You really don't meet any significant challenges other than the mutants and massive amounts of cannibals in later stages of the game. But you can just hide in the caves, it's safe and rich in resources there anyways. And not to forget, the caves. Ohhhh my f- god. How fast I grew bored of them. They almost don't change, are not particularly stunning and apart from the Chasm and Sinkhole cave don't pose any significant threat to you.

The basebuilding is fine, but it wasn't the most fun basebuilding I've ever seen. I for once didn't much care for it, even if I usually do enjoy it. The stuff you find doesn't really mean anything, I used the lighter 99% of the time instead of the torch, it just worked better. There are so many options for weapons, but apart from the bow, none stand out particularly in overall useability. They were more or less reskins. The other tools were fine, apart from maybe the pedometer, like fr, why is that even in the game??? 

The bugs were pretty funny but sometimes a hinderance. Like when you ride across a branch or stone with a log sled and you go flying 20 meters into the air, and this happened multiple times to me and my friend. The occasional cannibal or animal flying into the air was more funny than annoying, but it ruined the atmosphere. I did burst out laughing when a crocodile I just killed flew like 100 meters if not more in it's ragdoll pose. The most annoying bug/crash was when I tabbed out the window to play some songs, join a call on discord, etc. and the game crashed. This happened few too many times to be overlooked, and just to be safe, I didn't tab out of the game at all after experiencing this for the first few times.

The sound and art design of the enemies on the other hand, was the only thing I did actually like. It had it's minor hiccups but overall it suited the game and enhanced the experience. The mutants looked kinda scary and the cannibals were well designed. The caves are a different matter and a matter that I didn't really enjoy gameplay wise and looks wise.

Some spoilers for the crap story ahead.
[spoiler] The end game location was the second best thing in the game. I'm not talking about the Sinkhole (that one was pretty dissapointing and felt like they forgot what they even wanted to do there), I'm talking about the labs. They were genuinely fun to explore after the hours spent in the monotone caves. Shame you only spend a few minutes in them. 

The bossfight was fun, though it didn't really fill the void inside me from playing this game. It was challenging though, atleast one thing was.

The story itself? I would describe it like this: ""There's a story, yeah..."" The story wasn't present during the ""main"" game at all and the endgame felt like an almost different game from the early survival filled adventure. Saving Timmy didn't feel rewarding or gratifying, mainly because you only see him for like 2 minutes in the whole game. (Not including the cutscenes at the end) The whole story is more or less okay (a solid 3/10 for the effort), but it doesn't explain much, the random drawings and papers you find don't help it either, much less when you can't see what's on them half the time. The cutscenes at the end left even more confusion than they cleared. [/spoiler]

I for once don't really care for a second installment of the game and the story (If it should ever come out), because the first one left me really dissapointed and bored throughout apart from few (very few) shining moments of average gameplay.

The crafting menu was pretty fire tho."

11252,"If you're looking for a review on this game you've come to the wrong place, but if you're looking for an outstanding pie recipe you've come to the right place.

Ingredients:

1. 6 tablespoons unsalted butter
2. 1/2 cup white sugar
3. 1/2 cup brown sugar
4. 1/4 cup water
5. 1/4 teaspoon cinnamon
6. 1 pinch salt
7. 5 apples - peeled, cored and sliced
8. 1 pastry for double-crust pie

Directions:

1. Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C).
2. Combine butter, white sugar, brown sugar, water, cinnamon, and salt in a saucepan over medium heat. Bring to a boil, remove from heat and set aside.
3. Roll out half the pastry to fit a 9-inch pie plate. Place bottom crust in pie plate; pour in apple slices.
4. Roll out top crust into a 10-inch circle. Cut into 8 (1-inch) wide strips with a sharp paring knife or pastry wheel. Weave the pastry strips, one at a time, into a lattice pattern. Fold the ends of the lattice strips under the edge of the bottom crust and crimp to seal.
5. Pour butter-sugar mixture over top of pie, coating the lattice, and allowing any remaining sauce to drizzle through the crust.
6. Bake in the preheated oven for 15 minutes. Reduce heat to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C), and bake until the crust is golden brown, the caramel on the top crust is set, and the apple filling is bubbling, 35 to 40 more minutes. Allow to cool completely before slicing.

I can't tell you how many hours we just spent doing stuff which takes a long time but it's so satisfying once it's completed. This game also looks really beautiful, the graphics are amazing. I'll even say that the bugs kinda make this game more enjoyable, it's always fun to see these moments you weren't expecting and random glitches. However, they can also be annoying. There's not a lot to really say about this game because it's just a fun survival experience, can't wait to see what they do with the sequel. 6/10."

Why would I when I can build a battle gazebo surrounded by several bonfires to encourage nighttime ""visitors""? Fighting tooth and nail every night against packs of savages. Burning the bodies in the morning and using their bones to craft super cool armor.
So what I'm saying is: If you don't have a battle gazebo, can you really say you're playing The Forest?"

11320,"This is a fun game to play, either alone or with friends. However, I highly recommend playing this game with friends instead of by yourself. This is because, in my opinion, it is more fun to mess around while deadly mutant cannibal people are trying to kill you. Plus, I loved to hear my friends scream and curse like crazy when those mutant people came near them or when the cannibals did those weird calls in the trees (Get the game to find out). 
If you are playing for the achievements it may take you awhile to get them all because of one achievement in particular. Which is ""Step Master"". There are tips you can do to get it faster, but you are still going to be walking for a long LONG time. Other than that achievement the others are fairly somewhat quick to obtain."
11321,Its a lil scary but thats what makes it fun
11322,"very fun, kinda buggy tho"
11323,"Brilliant game. Me and a friend played for 80 in game days before even entering the end game area, there is tons to do and plenty of exploration if you want to, but it is also able to be completed in a relatively short amount of time. The level of story is really quite dependant on you, if you explore and find all the little pieces of lore scattered around I personally found it to be quite entertaining and some interesting discoveries. Of course, if you skip the extra pieces or don't care too much then it probably isn't as good, as a lot of the story is based on player discovery. 

The building aspect is not the absolute best, but pretty good all things considered. Survival side of things is quite easy after you get the hang of things and find some of the buggy areas (such as stun-locking larger animals with a melee weapon), but it is good enough at catching you off guard that even 44 hours in with many tools we were running around cold, starving and afraid.

In terms of horror, this game does it brilliantly. The atmosphere especially in caves or deep in the forest is terrifying, and single player is, of course, significantly scarier than co-op or group servers. Some of the discoveries you will make are highly disturbing or creepy, and the enemies while not being perfect AI-wise are pretty scary, and will probably kill you. Especially on your first discovery. 

Overall this game has me very excited for the sequel, I absolutely love playing through it and considering this was created in 2014 I am looking forward to the mechanics, graphics and atmosphere of the next game. This game is very well worth the money and will not let you down."

So I looked into if this had a peaceful mode and was not disappointed. If you literally just want to survive in the wild with minimal attacks (crocodiles and boars pretty much being it - until the end, which there IS a boss fight) and want to go spelunking while still getting creeped out, this is a great game.

11377,"The developers did a phenomenal job in this game. I am still surprised that this beautiful game is only 2 GB. I always played the game with a friend or so. That's why building anything was never tedious. I don't know about single players.

One thing could have been great if we could have some materials back when our buildings get destroyed. I only faced one bug, half of my leg was underground. Other than that No bugs at all.
There is enough crafting materials and crafting option in the game. But again one can never say when is enough. Any cool weapons(katana, chainsaw...) or items(flashlight) can only be found in caves or unique places.

Overall I had a tremendous amount of fun playing this game. This game deserves all the praises it is getting. I just hope the next game can improve from this and still keep the fun parts."

11429,"They show nude females but not nude males. Dumb. If it weren't for this, I'd give the game a positive review despite the janky physics and clunky controls. Like, why can't I just drink from the pond when I'm standing next to it. Why can't I move an object's blueprints without moving my character? Why does the animation happen twice every time I take out my compass using the hotkey? Overall though I love the game and I'm impressed only 4 people made it. If they add some decent male nudity or remove the gratuitous female nudity, I'll change my review to Recommend."

11439,"I definitely enjoy survival games, but survival horror was a new genre for me. I'm glad I tried this game out, because I actually genuinely enjoyed playing this game. It's absolutely brutal, and filled with a ton of body horror and gore, so fair warning to that. While none of the imagery in this game bothers me personally, I have a family member whom I've played with who has a trigger regarding some imagery depicted in the game, so definitely make sure anyone you play with is comfortable with the following, and content warning for the following list:


- Hanging, nooses, etc.
- Human remain piles, both bones and flesh
- Loud, unsettling audio from cannibals screaming in distance
- Plenty of blood, including screen effects
- Uncanny amalgamations with human limbs and features


I definitely recommend giving this game a try if survival horror interests you, but definitely be aware that some imagery is not suitable for all ages, and can be disturbing to some."

I'm not going to spoil anything but I was expecting just a survive in a forest with some cannibals that bother you and explore some caves but there's soooo much to this game. I highly recommend, especially with a friend. Trust me is so much better with a friend. I'm still in awe by how good this game is and I am so excited for sons of the forest."

11488,"Combat is horrible, especially melee. No it doesn't require practice. and a lot of my attacks get canceled out for some reason. you can tell they were trying to go for a more natural style of combat. But that's the thing it doesn't feel, and quite plainly isn't natural. And i have played games with throwing weapons that do not have a crosshair, and where the melee and ranged combat were more ""natural"",  not necessarily easier by any means. but just succeeded in doing what you could tell the devs were going for here. It is a really fun, and at times creepy and thrilling game with fun building mechanics. But in a game where combative survival is such a huge part of the game, it is definitely lacking."

11512,"My husband and I purchased the game early access and it was a lot of fun to play co-op!

(I've put in quite a few hours solo as well, but did not complete the game solo.)

The building system is fairly robust. If you are building a very large base, the resource gathering can be a bit grind-y, especially playing solo. But the time investment does pay off because you can build a pretty cool base!

The mutants can be a good level of challenging playing solo mode. Playing co-op the threat significantly declines, so I felt the ""horror"" element wasn't really there, but still a little bit of a challenge. 

I really enjoyed the story... we played back when the ending was first released and I believe there was only one ending at the time - but saw on YouTube there are now at least a couple endings. 

Since we purchased the game Early Access I think it was around $10 and amazing value... even full price (currently $19.99) I would still highly recommend this game if you're a fan of this genre.  I will definitely be purchasing Endnight's next game, Sons of the Forest!"

Went into a cave and there was just piles of dead babies + mutanted babies. Nope. Can't play anymore. It was too much."

game is also fun with friends! game is hard it will take you some time to play game fully but it's amazing!
i'm just posting this from my experience and i don't have game but it seems fun!"
11604,Good game!
11605,"I want to start out by saying I'm terrible at this game and I'm also playing solo when I'm fairly sure this game is not designed to be played solo, because of these two things I don't think I've really got too far into the nooks and crannies of the game yet. I figure 30 hours though, might be time to make an initial review. 

When I first played this I decided ""it's too hard I don't like it"" and stopped for ages, now I'm getting back into it I kind of like the challenge because it feels like an actual survival game. This isn't a game where you're the main character so fighting off a gang of ten attackers is as simple as hitting a button, you will have to out-think you enemies or outrun them. There's a good little adrenaline boost when it's been multiple hours since you last saved and it's pitch black and you hear those tell-tale footsteps of multiple enemies encircling you while you stumble through the trees back to your camp. 
Huddling by the fire while the rain pelts down, the air is freezing and the locals are beating on your walls is immersive af. Exploring the map is fun and while it isn't huge there's plenty to see, I've spent a good portion of time seeing the sights and that's without even having delved too deep into the caves yet. Watching the locals go about their daily lives is interesting, seeing how they interact with the world around them and what they make of your effect on their environment (they are NOT pleased about me making a big fort right on one of their patrol routes, for instance) is, for me, just as much fun as fighting them or escaping from them. 

There ARE some issues with the game, things that seem unfinished and bugs and glitches that will annoy the crap out of you but so far I've not found anything gamebreaking and have been able to adapt to every issue. 

If you're looking at this game and thinking ""I dunno if I should buy it, I don't think my friends will play it, it looks too difficult to me"" I'm gonna say you know what, just try it. Just dive on in. You'll most likely find yourself tired, hungry and dehydrated irl because you've spent the last 6 hours making your base look pretty and that's a sign of a good game."
11606,"Great survival game. Can't wait for ""Sons of The Forest""."
11607,"Its like Minecraft but with horrors beyond comprehension, war crimes, and cannibalism."
11608,it has titties in it
11609,[spoiler] your son kinda dies in the end
11610,"Its good, but its kind of buggy, when you die, you spawn back at the plane and not even at the house where you can save. Its annoying and when you leave and enter caves. frames die and you can possibly disconnect. 1/10"
11611,"Honestly, this games experience but its very buggy which ruins the game. I was playing with friends and we found the katana and chainsaw, as we were exiting the cave preparing to head back to base. Me and one other friend disconnected."
11612,"ive lost 2 worlds due to glitches and bugs that keeps happening to the game, sucks ass 1/10
"
11613,flesh
11614,bad dad simulator
11615,its pretty eater
11616,I like the crafting/survival aspect. Game keeps you on your toes with the cannibals!
11617,"its scary at first but they get eaiser as you play 
"
11618,"On the surface this seems like any other ordinary survival game, however through exploration the backstory of the peninsula will unveil itself overtime, there's a lot of lore to the forest, and a lot of deep and underlying messages it can present. This game actually inspired me to make a video on its theme of humanity, if anyone wants to check it out, it would be greatly appreciated https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKYutn5RLYY&t=229s"
11619,i love the game a lot
11620,play with friends solo is big  scary
11621,you can see tiddy
11622,all you do in The Forest is build with brown logs and its the most fun you can have playing it out
11623,"Hadn't played since Alpha phase & the game got a lot more fun.
Finished a playthrough with a friend recently & it was good fun.

The downside is that the achievements are very broken. Only the host of a game can get certain achievements & you can't save the map for a multiplayer game that you join in on, so you basically will miss out on a lot of achievements that you should have otherwise got.

I enjoy achievements so this has sadened me, but still a good game & good fun."
11624,Best played with friends
11625,I beat it before the achievements were a thing RIP. Great game though.
11626,Good game worth the time
11627,good game
11628,"Overall it's a decent experience when playing coop. The gameplay loop gets tedious pretty quick though, so I'd recommend just looking up a main campaign walkthrough after roaming around for a while. 
it's worth it imo If you're looking for a coop campaign game and there's a sale going on."
11629,is good
11630,Great game lots of fun.
11631,yess
11632,Good if you need a poop
11633,fun to become a base architect. cool but scary :)
11634,this is just like animal crossing
11635,"it is like you in a real life game
"
11636,"The game is shit, don't play, got stuck in sinkhole forever 

don't waste your money and time"

11638,terrifying game but slick as a dick
11639,ye
11640,epic
11641,Enjoyed some dried legs with my homies. Found a music tape. Had a good time.
11642,rf
11643,A raw chicken charged at me. 11/10
11644,"If you like naked people grouping up and hitting you with a bat, then you'd love this game!"
11645,game is fun
11646,is a god game
11647,good
11648,how to walk?
11649,"i saw boobs 
totally recommend it ."
11650,fun
11651,"I honestly don't get how the frick this game has so many positive reviews. I've played my fair share of survival games, and I've bought this since the early access, It simply sucks on many aspects:
- Items/tools Crafting: Monotonous and boring
- Combat: Basic and range weapons ain't fun
- Buildings Crafting: grindy and less useful than you'd expect
- Survival: Meh, nothing you have haven't seen in any other game
- Story: The hook is the child abducted and the cannibals but that gets old fast

Overall: I wouldn't recommend it unless you like having to chase birds with an axe since bow and arrows suck donkey balls."
11652,GOOD BYE TIMMY
11653,yes
11654,"It is not even possible to hit the rabits with an axe, just keep hitting in the air. wtf is this. Inventory keep going away, and it is not possible to remove things you build. 

This game seems like an early access, not a finished game??"
11655,really fun to play with friends
11656,I would have more fun gouging my eyes out than playing this game...
11657,"I've never experienced a game that leaves you afraid of what lies behind the trees in the dark, This game does a fantastic job at playing with tension and creating the sense of a real world situations and leaving the journey in the player's grasp. Beginning with a plane crash on a naked cannibal island it gives bioshock meets minecraft throwing you in an open sandbox with enemies all over. Allowing you to feel alien in your new yet familiar setting, fighting for your life whether creeping your way through the woods alone at night or forgetting your son's existence. I haven't been able to find another game that I've had this much fun with. It's one of the best survival games I've played in recent memory. I cannot wait for the forest 2"
11658,"scary and fun
"
11659,Very fun to chop up some cannibals in front of their other friends
11660,If you enjoy spending hours shopping down trees and killing animals while crazy cannibals hunting you down this is the perfect game for you.
11661,"fun and scary but mainly fun with a good story line
"
11662,"Great game 9.5/10, really enjoyed it. Great realistic mechanics, always a thrill, sometimes a bit scary. A great game to play together or alone. The storyline is really well made. Not the best graphics, but still good. Sometimes bugs with the log sleigh !!!"
11663,"nice game

11686,Great survival game which can be scary at first but you get used to it. Love the story and the hunting and combat is very fun.
11687,I liked the survival aspect and being constantly chased by Cannibals. Makes the game hard to play but fun.
11688,Fun for the whole family!

11704,"received this game a few years ago from a friend, if you can stomach manic cannibals, horrifying mutants, and unpleasant dark caves, you're gonna have a great time!

P.S. Chopping trees down is so satisfying."
11705,"wow. so i bounced off this game when it was in early access. Honestly it was a bit too hard and....well...too scary and nerve racking. I did really enjoy what i played but after fighting off lots of mutants and building a fort i felt stuck.

I returned after 1.0 released and have just beaten the game. wow. what an experience. I don't play a lot of survival games I find them a bit tediuous but this game finds a good balance. Spelunking in the caves is intense and surviving in the forest feels rugged and great....and man if you make it to the end you are in for a treat. This game understands the medium and is a truly mezmorizing experience 12/10"

i will tell you the start of the game. you and your son Timmy are going somewhere in a plane when the plane encounters some turbulence and for some reason the plan begins to crash. you wake up to see your son kidnapped by someone who isn't part of the fallout 4 institute and then blackout you wake up grab your trusty emergency axe and begin your adventure full of horror hard work, effort and to save your son Timmy

11763,My wife left me for playing this game
11764,ma violeaza un monstru cu 7 picioare ajutor
11765,I made body pillows from the cannibals and mutants. Lovely!
11766,Its not actually as scary as it would seem and there are like NO jumpscares 11/10.(The mutated cannibals run at you insanely fast so watch out for that)
11767,w
11768,"So me and my friends picked this game up for 5-8 dollars (can't remember exactly but cheap) and played it expecting a couple of days of a goodish survival game with some weird cannibal sub-plot, we ultimately got way more then we were expecting. None of us don't really enjoy playing survival games and we especially don't play more for than 2 or 3 sessions, The Forest was different. We ended up coming back to discover what lore was tucked away in this forest every other day (way more then we usually find time for). We also were quite often concerned for each others safety even near then end when were more or less decked out, constantly working to survive and constantly keeping aware of our surroundings (we played on hard mode).
 It also was the first time the 3 of us reached an ending to a story where we all wanted different paths or were torn on which result we wanted from the game (we normally just quickly settle on want suits us as a group) we were invested in different ways. 
Do I think this is the most polished or the best game to be released? Was it the best survival or the best story we have ever played... probably not but damn does this game surprise you in all of those categories, it really does, honestly it is really good at that. If you find this game at a price you are satisfied with please play it all the way through, it is worth it."
11769,good
11770,Definitely one of my favorite games of all time.
11771,cool epic

11783,"One of the best survival and open world games I have played, can easily be run on my Surface Pro 7+ on the highest graphics, gorgeous game. It has the full experience for those who just want to build and have a casual play through, and people who want some challenge. Even their normal mode can be a little difficult, but in a positive way. It progressively gets more difficult as you play on and build more structures. And without revealing too much, you are not alone on the island, so build up some defenses! YouTube videos might be required for a few things here and there, or you can challenge yourself, but overall a well-made game with fantastic AI and progressive difficulty. Seriously, well done to the development team. Could not applaud more."

11848,absolutely horrifying.
11849,"The Forest is a fun game but it isn't without its problems. 

I feel there isn't much I can say for gameplay that sets itself apart from other survival games from the time but I'll admit that while other have stayed in Early-Access limbo, the developers of this one did see it through to the end and are working on a sequel which looks vastly better.

BUT... There some issues. Firstly, it was clearly made in Unity. The caves and massive sinkhole in the centre of the map are rather janky and the most dangerous parts of the map or caves don't tend to yield the best loot. For e.g. there is just 5 cannibals between the entrance of the cave and the modern axe which has the best block in the game while [spoiler] the keycard to reach the end of the game is protected by just one mutant [/spoiler]. Meanwhile, the modern bow, which is not that good of an upgrade from the bow you craft in protected by 2 massive enemies. 

Worth the purchase still if you have friends to play with!"
11850,"Brilliant game when i last played on PS4, cant wait to try it out on PC"
11851,Tree
11852,Cool game but game breaking bugs is LJIRHGOQELI;JH;PWQERJGMB'/QRBIP[DSFBIE[RG]RE :)
11853,"Disgustingly buggy, I really dont understand how this game got such good reviews, yes when it works its good but it always breaks in strange ways i.e. reloading a save point is not the same as reloading a save point on initial application startup. For example I got captured by the cannibals, I got the map and compass in the cave, I continued to play (created new save points and during this game play loaded from them) the next day I started the game up again, loaded my most recent save point and no map or compass, I tested to see what happens when the cannibals get me (they should only capture the player once then kill from then on) and I'm back in the cave so basically I need to start another new game but honestly this game is not so good that I will redo all of the monotonous shit that one needs to do again so just gonna remove, dont buy this game!

 This game is a real waste of time as the save games just break anyway."

11857,"Fun with friends, would not want to play it alone."
11858,very scary game #legsy
11859,"This game is barely a survival game. Sure, you can craft a bunch of structures and items but very few of it is actually beneficial. In the case of buildings, it can actually be detrimental because it seems to increase enemy aggro. So the game actively is trying to get you not to build much. The rest of the game is just exploring caves randomly until you find the right ones(or looking on the wiki to find the right ones)."

11887,"Got the game, 30 min after i try multiplayer, after the cinematic of the plane, i got kill over and over and over, coud not even move, nice welcome to the game :( 

30% of the server owner/host cheat / grief

50% of the other servers, you allways find a cheater or better say he find you , and ruin everything for everyone.

and the other 20% of the servers if you are lucky they kick you when you enter or play just a little be and then host leave.

Very very low population in the game, peak hours maybe around 10 servers, and if you count the  % i mentioned before... well you get it how it is.

They should make official servers like every online game have,maybe 1 pve and another pvp ? should fix a lot of problems and maybe get more players to play.

It's a shame, I liked the game :("
11888,
11889,nice game
11890,Nice game
11891,"There's glaring issues from the first minute of gameplay. Picking up items often requires surgical accuracy. Chopping trees bugs out and you lose stamina for nothing. I got FPS drops pretty frequently no matter the graphical settings. AI sucks ass. Enemies run in circles and birds fly straight into your mouth. You can't drink water from a spring, but sometimes can drink from a still pond, which gives you diarrhea. Plastic, metal and booze bottles everywhere but you can only hold water in a waterskin made of deer skin. The brightness and contrast options do absolutely nothing, and I had to squint my eyes 10 cm from the monitor every time I was in a cave or it was night. Also sometimes you have to wait for like 5 minutes in absolute darkness before you can sleep through the night. The character can't survive 2 seconds in snow, and once you get a warmsuit and explore the snowtop, there's absolutely nothing there. You need a raccoon skin for the warmsuit, but I didn't see one raccoon for the 30 days I was on the island, and had no idea I needed a raccoon skin before I googled it. Those are most of the problems I had.

So I completed the game and I got no achievement for it, which seemed odd. So I checked and indeed, there is an achievement for completing the game. So I googled more, and when there are 2 options on how to end the game [spoiler](one is that you let past be past and the other is that you kill a plane full of people)[/spoiler], the good guy option doesn't grant you the achievement. So I reloaded a save from 1 hour past and did the final boss and completed the ending again, [spoiler]this time making sure I murder all those people[/spoiler], just to get the achievement. Jesus. Oh and you can't skip cutscenes or the credits."

11935,"Poor UI choices, missing quality of life settings, especially for VR. 
We ended up losing all our progression even though we saved because of a bug. Server started spamming null ref exceptions."
11936,"Experience playing multiplayer for about an hour and a half. Ran into some game breaking bugs, loss of progress, and buggy server-side code causing clients to be kicked spontaneously.

The game feels a bit too janky, unintuitive, and confusing system to really want to bother trying to look past the loss of save data. That's something a released game should -never- have, not to mention 3-4 years after it's release date. 

Combat with a co-op part has poor feedback as well, trying to help friends kill enemies I had no idea I was also cleaving them with attacks. 0 feedback to me that I was actually hitting friends. 

Inventory and crafting system seems cool and unique, it's kind of annoying once you overlook the gimmick. I'd rather a list of possible crafts that I have available to me than slapping 1 item in at a time and checking the available options are then guessing what the icons mean. 

Carry limit is weird and doesn't follow convention of what other survival games do. You can carry every item in the game at once, but only up to a certain limit for each one. But if you ONLY want to carry stone, you can only ever hold up to to 5. I'd rather a weight system or some other form of inventory management than whatever logic this is."

[h1]PROS :[/h1]
* Crafting possibility : like Subnautica, stranded Deep, etc. you get quite a few premade building you can make, but you also have ""expandable"" structure like walls and zipline that you can extend to your heart's contempt's.
* Not easy combat, you will have to exploit what is at your disposal and keep escape route open.  The enemies AI is well crafted, with enemies sometimes circling you before attacking, not necessarily attacking one at a time.
* Enemies have a hierarchy which makes for interesting things.  If you paint yourself they think you are a god and will possibly momentarily leave you alone and/or kneel before you.  Some cannibals are leaders and killing them can make the others scatter for some time.  Some cannibals were seen crying their dead which is an interesting addition, making it all so much more immersive.
* Pretty much everything is hidden in caves, forcing you into narrow corridors and unfamiliar terrain to fight the cannibals.
* Big mutants are definitely changing the beat of the game. as you get used to fighting cannibals, you are faced with these things that have the upper hand and you have to develop different fighting tactics.
* The map is varied with different biomes, different terrain, different resources spawning in different places. 
*Story is a bit confusing at first, but everything unfolds nicely near the end.

[h1]CONS :[/h1]
* Item crafting is weird and there is no efficient crafting recipe log where you can search what you can possibility build and look for the resources. (Except the internet of course)
* Night and caves are SOOO dark, unless you use alternate graphic options. (Texas color grading helps a lot) Can craft a torch, can't hold it in your left hand for light while using the axe.  Lighter and torch don't send light far enough, making it impossible to navigate at night.  This can really bring the spooky vibes, but if you are trying to play on youtube and/or stream, you're viewers won't see a thing and progress will be very slow as you'll need to craft tiki torch as you progress which will require you going back and forth to get resources to advance a little bit.  Water is also completely blurry, making it impossible to see anything.  To prevent you going into the water with fear of shark, that is perfect.  If you are however trying to find something underwater, it is very hard.  Try playing with ocean quality set to ""flat"". This last bit is much easier once [spoiler]you get the rebreather (it has a light on it!)[/spoiler]
* Many mechanics are very obscures.  Ex : when sneaking, when the eye is lit, does it mean very visible or very hidden?  Took a bit to figure out as I seemed to sometimes be completly hidden yet the eye was full.  Aiming with spear/bow. Upgrading weapons.  Strength, athleticism, sanity, and calories (hard survival mode only) also required me googling how they work. Once you get used to them however, it makes a really nice game with a unique style.  Never has throwing a spear been so realistic...in the sense that i miss 90% of my targets...
* Sleeping mechanics? You can't sleep until the circle is filled at the bed, but it doesn't represent time of the day?  Had to wait 3/4 of the night to sleep once.  WTF is it?!  From reading online, I understand the goal is to force you to not simply sleep all nights away and have to endure the darkness and fear. With normal settings where night is too dark, that often means standing around and doing nothing for a while.  Kills the beat of the game.
* Massive mutants are cool to vary the game. However, when they spawn near your base, they can cause damage that represents a massive amount of work before you even know it.  Especially if they spawn in group of 3...  This can get annoying as it feels like whatever you build has to be temporary.  Alternatively, you need to select a base location before starting, knowing where mutants don't spawn."

You'll sit down, and before you knew it, one, two, three, four hours pass by. The game practically glues you to the screen. Never a dull moment."

12032,"Write a review for The Forest
Please describe what you liked or disliked about this game and whether you recommend it to others.
Please remember to be polite and follow the Rules and Guidelines."
12033,Only played Multiplayer but even with several friends this game is utterly terrifying. Definitely recommend. Some of the building can feel a bit clunky but overall very well done.
12034,Great survival game
12035,I honestly love this game a lot. I definitely have over 600 hours into it if you count the time I've played on PS4. It's basically a realistic minecraft but scarier. I love the fact that i can just forget about my son and go cave exploring and build a pretty cool base.
12036,"Its scary but overall a good game, even better if you have someone to play with you. Can't wait till I get a VR headset to see what it would be like to be actually in the world."
12037,I love this game!! Its great to play it with friend but can also play it solo. (With friends its more fun) Cant wait for the forest 2.

12042,it scary
12043,"This is hands down my favourite survival game ever made. I've been playing since the times of trees falling on your base and exploding on impact, the log sled shooting you up into the sky and insta-killing all enemies by touching them with the tip of a fire arrow. All of those things made the game so fun, and even though those glitches aren't there anymore, I still enjoy this game with all my heart.

Holding a lizard by it's tail and showing the head of a shark to my friends really made me the man I am today, thanks The Forest for all these years of fun. 

You won't regret this purchase."

12080,"This is the only game where you can cause global warming and nobody will get mad, also you can kill women and babies without the cops chasing you

11/10 Would commit war crimes again"
12081,"Certain building mechanics make me wanna drown myself sometimes but it's a super fun and spooky game, i especially recommend it if you have friends to play with"
12082,"I recommend this game both for casual and veteran gamers for the following reasons:

1. Its atmosphere is very welcoming, but can also be scary in certain places. That's why the multiplayer option is there.
2. The concept is fresh and unique. A must experience game for any video game enthusiast.
3. Exploration is fun. There is no dull moment in this game. The thrill of exploring unknown territory, along with the fact that you're risking your life to look for your son, is addicting.
4. The AI here actually feels alive. Combined with the graphics, it makes you feel like you're actually in the game yourself. The environment, the cannibals, and the animals are just so immersive in its own right.
5. The inventory and crafting mechanic is realistic and interesting. Personally, I just wow'd at every new item that I crafted for the first time.
6. Not to mention the building mechanics are also fun. It's not hard to learn, and it's interesting to experiment with the building materials. Although there will be bugs and some minor issues associated, I don't find them that big of a deal.
7. Even if this is a game, your survival skills will be challenged. Incompetence in preparation before setting out can make a difference.
8. The combat mechanics is okay. If you're not creative with how you fight the enemies, you'll end up using a lot of resources, and unnecessarily lose HP. Basically, be smart with how you use your weapons!"

12133,"Look im the kinda guy that actually gets scared of ""scary"" stuff in games, like dbd was terrifying before I tried to get good at it and remembered its a game.

With that in mind this game has some enjoyable scary moments, once you get used to your fellow islanders and become the hunter it still manages to stay interesting. Its way more fun than I expected it to be.

My one tip would be when crafting in your inventory hover over the gear that shows up, it allows you to see everything that can be crafted with the item which at least for me helped loads."

12151,"No idea how this game has the positive hype it has...

Every single system in this game is sub-par, buggy, unfun.

Combat is jank.
Building is pointless.
AI is TERRIBLE, they either run in circles right next to you, or run at you (and miss) on repeat.
There are literally only 5 different enemy types (other than reskins).
Cave exploration is interesting... the first time, tedious after the 3rd-7th identically uninspired scenes.
Food/Drink system is pointless, every 2nd cave room drops 10 sodas and 10 candy bars, never need to cook/prep food.
Get ready to spend 2 minutes after EVERY encounter burning bodies to rebuild your armour."
12152,"So, basically I've been playing The forest with my friend Alexandur for quite a while. We got all the stuff from the caves, and even finished the game. We decided to go with the ending, where you don't save Timmy, because we wanted to get the artefact from the cave. It was all great until Alexandur's game glitched, so he left and re-joined the server. We decided to change the place of the artefact, but couldn't find it anywhere. (We previously put it on the grass, because we didn't want any cannibals near.) We tried re-joining the server, to see if the artefact has re-spawned in the cave, but there wasn't a trace of it. I would really appreciate it, if the operators of the game fix this problem. Overall, the game isn't bad. It's just the re-spawning problem that needs to be fixed. Thank you for the attention."

12186,titties hihihi
12187,"I have issues with games that make plot points about dead kids.
Other than that... it's a game.
A game that borrows from quite a few others, and frankly, has been done better in other formats.
Survival horror is better with PACING, not random placement.
Survival is better without constantly respawning stuff.
You get the idea.  Just... got bored, and realized there are better games out there to play. 
If you've got nothing better to do... feel free to march up and down the square a while..."

2. Combine butter, white sugar, brown sugar, water, cinnamon, and salt in a saucepan over medium heat. Bring to a boil, remove from heat and set aside.
3. Roll out half the pastry to fit a 9-inch pie plate. Place bottom crust in pie plate; pour in apple slices.
4. Roll out top crust into a 10-inch circle. Cut into 8 (1-inch) wide strips with a sharp paring knife or pastry wheel. Weave the pastry strips, one at a time, into a lattice pattern. Fold the ends of the lattice strips under the edge of the bottom crust and crimp to seal.
5. Pour butter-sugar mixture over top of pie, coating the lattice, and allowing any remaining sauce to drizzle through the crust.
6. Bake in the preheated oven for 15 minutes. Reduce heat to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C), and bake until the crust is golden brown, the caramel on the top crust is set, and the apple filling is bubbling, 35 to 40 more minutes. Allow to cool completely before slicing."

12264,dd
12265,Game
12266,"Best experience: hiding in a hut surrounded by cannibals. Storming outside, so dark I can only see the cannibals thanks to the few torches around. They all want me dead but for some reason can't enter my hut. After several minutes a female cannibal is in my hut, but she's no longer agro. She's defected! (cannibal has joined your party!) I spend the rest of the night defending her only for her to... explode when morning came. (turns out I killed her earlier but she bugged out lol) 
Maybe ideas for a sequel? Have an army of trained cannibals...?

12272,"Great Survival/Coop/Horror Game

When playing in coop it's basically really good survival fun while horror is not really present due to the coop. When playing single player, however, the horror is really good due to the great lighting, sound design and overall athmosphere."
12273,"i like the tits, very nice."

12285,"One of my favorite survival multiplayer games that I have played, even tho the game is kinda old it still feels like a whole new game that came out this year. The games concept is not unique it's  but playeble and fun in it's own way. Well I honestly didn't care too much about the story but I guess it's decent?"
12286,The best multiplayer horror survival open world story game ever!
12287,the mfs pull up on you with a whole gang like youre some sort of mafia boss
12288,"Great ambience, inventory management is a bit quirky at first but super nice once you get used to it. Playing solo gives you one of the best actual survival feels in the genre. Is it completely perfect? no, but it's definately  worth the price."
12289,Multiplayer Fun
12290,Me like :)
12291,"Overall it's an excellent survival horror game and the base building is fantastic. Enemies react to how you behave and they are heavily influenced by how you play and set up camps: playing a more hidden approach with several small tree houses will result in less night time attacks, and a more defensive approach with advanced traps and big walls in one spot will result in more night time attacks. The atmosphere is dripping, for example, when you crawl through a dark cave and you hear a low clicking growl akin to a giant spider bear... then you spot a glimpse of something large and fleshy moving in the dark... It's so good.

There are things I don't like, which are all kind of minor in the grand scheme of things, such as: [list]
[*] The longer you survive, the bigger base you build and the more enemies you kill... the more the enemies will attack and up their game in terms of strength, which results in large enemies that can one-shot your camps. It feels counter-productive to set up bases, survive and kill off attackers because you know that it'll only make things worse and it could all be deleted in one attack. 
[*] The combat is also janky with bad hit reg, clunky movements and bad shooting where arrows bounce off of invisible walls all the time. 
[*] It's either too dark or too bright, unless you change settings back and fourth between outside day time and night time / cave exploring. Even with the seperate setting for cave brightness set to max you won't see far in a cave. I see this design choice as good in thought, but poor in practice. 
[*] The story is really messed up and kind of poor (I'm guessing its the canon one, since it has the most content and is the most obvious path). [/list]"
12292,nice
12293,the scares are scary
12294,"You are what you eat.

But seriously. One of the best open world, survival, crafting games ive played in a long time."

12299,"Really enjoyed this game! Was super fun to play with a group a friends and can play multiple times! The survival aspect is amazing, the story-line is really good to follow and the game definitely has some thrill factors. I have never played a game like it and I am definitely excited to play the second one! 10/10 definitely recommend!"

12307,"I was gifted this game by a friend and started playing right away. I found myself on the game for hours at a time just hanging out with friends and having a good time. It was scary at first, but once you get into playing a lot and learn about how to do things, it's super fun. I definitely recommend this game if you like horror-ish games."

12320,yes
12321,"Nice.

12322,A great game. I would of made a few tweeks to the game. When it comes to the map you should be able to write on it so you can tell which cave you had cleared out or not and/or write down various notes. You should be able to bring your solo character into a friends game instead of starting a fresh character (I mean i get why they did that but the option to do that would be nice). The food and water consumption is a bit to much for my liking. The Day and Night cycle is a tad to fast and there should be an option to customize it to your personal preference. Other then that I'm enjoying the game so far I hope part 2 is even better!
12323,Such an amazing game!
12324,">100hrs in and I just fought 6-7 elite cannibals, 2 mutants (Cowman and Virginia), 3-4 regular cannibals and a CROCODILE

With friends it's even better can't w8 for 2nd."
12353,dash kire in bazi alie
12354,Although the main plot does have a pretty good lineup theres a few issues I have with the game. Without all the collectibles or closely examining story items the first time around you will have more questions than answers (this is something that happened to me on my first play through of the game). The ending also comes and goes really quick. However the building system in this game although not perfect is absolutely astounding! The game is great for base building especially on multiplayer. The ending boss is weak and you can end up respawning again and again until you beat it. However if your like me and a friend you will find every way to break the ending of the game and have to spend two hours trying to get both endings because you kept breaking or having bugs somehow. 10/10 would play again
12355,i like forest

12404,"This has become a VR favorite for my husband and I, as well as my brother. We spent many hours building and killing cannibals before even attempting to look for little Timmy. Super fun to build, great exploration, caves were spooky, and interesting ending.

12417,"great game
"
12418,good
12419,"Was expecting a lot more.

The game is fairly buggy, still (one example, drinking water isn't as easy task as it may seem, you need to find a certain angle at which your character will be able to sip some water from a pond). Mechanics are very questionable, seems most things you do in other survival games are the complete opposite here. 

Game itself is not that pleasing to the eye as well. Armor looks very shitty and protrudes through the clothing. 

All in all, glad I got the game on a very big sale, would not be worth otherwise. Got a few hours of gameplay, would not bother for more. Would suggest to have a look into other survival games on the market."
12420,"Fun and terrifying.
Rust but PvE and crack educed cannibals, six legged pot dealers, 80 armed booty ticklers, and a PHATASSED big boy who loves to run into your face.
10/10 experience
Haven't finished the story yet, but so far Its a fun little mix of Horror and survival, keeps you active and pumped with Adrenalin."

12451,"The Forest is, at its heart, a very simple game: you‚Äôre stranded after a plane crash and must survive the unwelcome cannibals and mutants that populate the land and want to pulverise you into delicious man-burgers. To avoid becoming someone‚Äôs dinner, you can forage, build and scavenge.

Perhaps the key draw of the game is the base-building. This is a rather clunky affair, with logs, stones and sticks being the main building elements. There is no realism involved here beyond the basics: no turning a log into planks to make it go further, no cementing stones together, no harvesting sticks from the trees you cut down. However, you can construct ziplines, a variety of bizarrely huge and complex traps and weird things like skull chandeliers. Frankly, there hasn‚Äôt been much logical thought put into the building side of things but, despite this, it is a lot of fun, and dodging enemy patrols to go and grab some materials from a nearby spooky copse so you can finish off a roof and avoid a downpour can be terrifyingly exciting.

Injury physics don‚Äôt exist: a head-shot will kill a cannibal outright but shoot one several times in a leg and it will still run around as normal. The AI is much-vaunted and is commendable and interesting but it didn‚Äôt really impress me: cannibals either see you and attack; or they see you and don‚Äôt attack, essentially. Really interesting AI would have allowed me to very slowly gain trust with some of them, perhaps even achieving simple trading. Fauna AI is almost non-existent: a deer will commonly stand there while you beat it to death.

The gore level is very high and to the point where it becomes a bit silly and ineffective.
 
The graphics are still acceptable with the basic textures in some places being offset by the gorgeous floral ensembles in others.

Regardless of all of the above, my experience has been absolutely plagued by bugs and crashes and, while some of those might be due to the variables of PC gaming, there were so many crashes (of different types) that I‚Äôm sure some are due to the game itself. Searching online for solutions shows that others endure the same problems.

If I could save my game whenever I wanted to in order to mitigate lost progress (you can only save at certain points) then I would be recommending The Forest.

If it‚Äôs cheap or you‚Äôre on the fence, or you‚Äôre good at ironing out the bugs then I say go for it. Just don't expect a deep, realistic survival game."
12452,"this game encourages you to invade other people's land, cut down their trees, murder them, and eat them. this game should be taught in schools as the perfect example of colonialism. for those said reasons, i think this game is pretty poggers. i would even say that this game is pretty ebic. thank you for coming to my ted talk."

12466,"At first glance, the game may seem to have a weak storyline that can be completed in less than 1 hour, a small list of buildings, a joystick with a bad adaptation, etc.  

But despite all the disadvantages, a week after the end of the game, you are drawn to return back.  And when you accidentally saw that a sequel to the game is coming out in 2022, you begin to look forward to it.

 P.S. Dear developers!

12484,"My friend and I were wandering a beach and saw some turtles and thought, ""These would probably make good food."" only to find out that you can actually use the shells as sleds! We went to the biggest hill we could find, and after dealing with the nearby locals, we spent nearly 3 hours just going up and down, having the time of our lives. Who knew turtle shells made such good sleds? When we told a mutual friend of ours what we had discovered, he told us about this game and how you could also use turtle shells as sleds. 10/10 would recommend."
12485,"servers lose your progress, waste of time"

12512,Very fun when you shoot someone 10 times and they're still live
12513,Girl Boobs
12514,good
12515,When i first started the game i was a dingus i didn't know what i was doing but after looking at the WIKI now me a smart boy and know what i'm doing. good good game 8/10
12516,The story telling is vivid and the experience is amazing. The crafting system is the best I have seen and the building system is very enjoyable. You can hunker down in a nice log cabin or you can enjoy a life at sea. There is nothing wrong with this game and is a must for any survival enthusiast!
12517,"Overall, this is a good game. I would highly recommend playing it with friends.

Graphics are decent, physics - very good and game isn't ""glitchy"" as you might think. Story of this game and your quests/tasks are interesting. Playing it on solo mode is okay, but it's much more grindy and terrifying. The fact that game is horror genre and a survival, makes it anti-fun when played solo. Roaming over map at nights, at solo mode - forget about it, unless you want hearth attack.

Multiplayer mode in this game is whole different story. Makes this type of game (horror survival) actually fun and less scary at the same time. Just by knowing you are not alone and that you can build/craft things way faster. 

This is usual for horror games, but it's worth mentioning - the more you play the less scary it is. For example, when you stumble upon some cannibal or monster for the first time, yeah - you pretty much run away. But later on, you will be farming those for breakfast - literally :)

The only cons I could mention are:

- Fight mechanics --- not that good. Fighting doesn't feel real. It's more like swinging and expecting to hit. Same way on the other hand, sometimes you think enemy won't hit you but it does and vice versa.
- Visibility when using lights, torches etc. --- Sometimes it doesn't 'light your path' at all. You can light up a torch and almost never is 'better/brighter'. Multiplayer mode perfectly explains this 'issue'. By lighting a torch or turning the lamp on, it's way brighter on your friends screen then on yours and vice versa. 

To sum thins up - yeah, buy this game, play it with your friends, have fun/laugh a lot. Then uninstall it and leave it in your steam inventory till' your younger brother or cousin says ""Hey, do you have some game that I can play?"" then reinstall it, grab popcorn and watch them freak out :)

12519,Nice KAMING
12520,"This is such an interesting game, and it's put some hypnotic trance on me. An obsession would phrase it lightly, but i dream about this game haha. I guess I enjoy that there is multiplayer and it makes it a whole different world. I am definitely going to sink a sh*t ton of hours into this and lose my mind. Can't recommend this game enough, grab your chainsaw and get ready to destroy naked cannibals."
12521,This is a really good game.
12522,I liked getting spooked enough to the point where I scream and annoy my boyfriend who is also playing with me

12565,I have at least 500 hours on this game. Have fun with building a 3k wooden building
12566,you can use tortoise shell as a sled 10/10
12567,"This game sometimes can be scary and difficult.Replayability is up to you.Graphics are nice.This game's best part is the story.It has very well writen story.When you start to play this game it will attract you.If you like horror-survival you should really try it.There is one bad thing.When you finished this game you will search similar game,but you won't find...

You'll definitely get your money's worth.Give it a shot,you wont be regret."
12568,"played this with a lot of friends, and the story is driving even in multiplayer. unique weapons are interesting, but not abundant. combat is a mix of easy and hard varying from enemy to enemy. while building can create impressive structures, there are much too many limitations to have it be described as good. reviewing this game now is pointless, but the sequel will hopefully improve on it all. the survival elements are not particularly hard, especially with infinite fish, and breeding rabbits. with an improvement to building and possibly travelling, this game would be quite possibly one of the better survival games of all time. sons of the forest should hopefully fill all the holes this game left, with the addition of electricity and more complex crafting. i enjoyed playing this game with my friends, although some things do become rinse and repeat."
12569,yea

12650,"Back when men were men, me and my baby momma were unstoppable.
No one ravaged a severed human leg like her. Her insatiable eyes made my toes curl.

But since those twitter soy boys gave these dirty savages civil rights.
It's all fallen apart.

I can't even go to the store without seeing these gangling 8 legged fucks take the last 13 jugs of milk.
Fuckers got not one mouth.
Sure as hell aint giving it to her kids either. Saw one of them overhand throw their jit at a cashier for a slushie. 
All I could think was ""Damn. We let these fatlegs into the WNBA, it's over for us""

I'm glad there's a game out there for us men who wanna revisit the good ol days.

And also, Really? the devs made it so when you die and you go to get your stuff they had to spawn hundreds of enimes while i only have a rock. The amount of times those enimes farmed me is just bullying at this point. if your looking for a good survival game but a game where you can't acually finish, well this game is for you."

12730,"Amazing game, I had a lot of fun playing it since the early beta."
12731,"Good game, hard when playing on your own. Great survival game with crafting, horror, hunting etc. Fun game when you have others to play along with."
12732,yes
12733,This game is taking longer to develop than PC 2.

but also good game yes .u."
12735,"yes

12736,Not bad at all. There are times where the game has some bugs but not many. It's pretty cheap for what it's worth. I recommend it.

12740,"The Industrial Revolution and its consequences have
been a disaster for the human race. They have greatly
increased the life-expectancy of those of us who live in
‚Äúadvanced‚Äù countries, but they have destabilized society,
have made life unfulfilling, have subjected human beings
to indignities, have led to widespread psychological suffering (in the Third World to physical suffering as well) and
have inflicted severe damage on the natural world. The
continued development of technology will worsen the situation. It will certainly subject human being to greater indignities and inflict greater damage on the natural world,
it will probably lead to greater social disruption and psychological suffering, and it may lead to increased physical

12750,FUN GAME
12751,amazing fucking game
12752,yes
12753,11
12754,"You expect a simple, clunky survival game with cannibals until a long, compelling story suddenly hits you and takes you on a wild, exciting and saddening ride. It can be combat-heavy at times, so make sure you like simple melee combat mechanics. A clear recommendation and worth the full price. 

Play with friends. And if your island has a single tree left standing after you're done with it, you're doing it wrong."
12755,I am the cannibal.
12756,This game is amazing! cant wait for sons of the forest!
12757,"This is a game with a lot of good ideas and a lot of problems. Overall it's pretty fun, but I won't recommend it because I can not condone selling an unfinished bugged mess like this. I played it multiplayer exclusively. The review would probably get too long if I were to write my thoughts about it randomly, so I'll just list and summarize all my points.

The good:
-large and beautiful world to explore
-can craft a base, decent level of customization
-interesting survival mechanics

The bad:
-one of the most buggy games I have ever played, honestly feels like playing an alpha. Nothing seems to work properly. Lots of item duplication, game crashes, flying items due to poor collision/physics interactions, persistent graphical bugs, the strength mechanic simply doesn't work in multiplayer for the non-hosts (you can only gain 2 strength by session even though it should be 2 by ingame days), sometimes when you start building something it will bug out so that you can feed it items but those items won't count towards the completion of the project
-lots of things can just despawn right in front of your eyes
-the base building is 100% optional. There's basically nothing to gain from building a base as far as the main objective of the game, cave exploration, is concerned.
-when playing solo the game gives you the map key item, but in multiplayer you have to stumble upon it
-the map is a mess. The simplistic outlines to make it appear as if it was hand-drawn is alright. The cursor representing your position being imprecise both in time and space is not, the weird and incomprehensible way map segments are drawn upon discovery is not, and inversely, the way you can somehow map things that are in adjacent inaccessible tunnels without ever seeing them is not. You can't even get to properly map the entrance of most caves. Was this ever tested? I don't think so.
-the inventory is a monstrosity. It is so bad that it could even be used as an example of what not to do for future developers.
-building a base takes eons and a lot of utility buildings like the ziplines barely work
-the ""can't sleep now"" timer is abhorrent and works inconsistently when restarting the server. I don't even really get why they bothered to implement this. Wasted time that should have been spent fixing bugs.
-the story and setting aren't worth mentioning
-most of the game settings (graphical, sound etc) just don't work. As in, they literally do nothing.
-I have never been much of a fan of games that use darkness to prevent you from seeing stuff. I just find the mechanic unfun.
-contextual actions on a button are a terrible idea most of the time, and here the gameplay difference between attacking down or horizontally is a huge problem in my opinion
-enemy AI is silly, lots of enemies stuck running in circle, running towards a wall etc
-losing your stats and upgrades with death in multiplayer is ok, but losing map completion isn't"
12758,its just good
12759,"who needs to find their son when you can just gather 5000 logs, build a fantastic house, get attacked by cannibals, become a cannibal, set monsters with multiple arms and legs on fire and find an epic chainsaw in an adventure through the caves?"
12760,"The game has really great graphics and audio effects. I like the landscape and the AI for the 'enemies' that comes up to you every other day. What I don't like about it is the sensitivity. It's too high but I'm adapting lol. 

Definitely would recommend this game."
12761,pro game
12762,its fun
12763,very fun and addicting!
12764,great
12765,ITS FUN
12766,"I have to say I'm not a big fan of these survival games, at least this particular style, but I was greatly surprised by this game. The lore is nice, the game mechanics are complicated at first but later on, it comes naturally. Definitely buy it if you're not scared of random cannibals screaming for no reason."

12839,"Alone stranded on a island after a plane crash, you go to explore and while you're looking down to grab something, you raise your head and see a shadow moving quickly.

12845,POGU GAME
12846,minecraft but rtx 10/10
12847,"just a good game the enemy ai is insanely good
"
12848,"The game feels simple but refined. There are some gimmicky quirks but overall I found the experience to be unique in its own. The ominous presence of unpredictable enemies makes for an enjoyable challenge. Sometimes you might feel like your base's defence and your overall strategy are on point until a rhino-mutant  strolls along and knocks your walls down like toothpicks and slamfists you in a corner until you have no armor. The constant need to re-think defence and the way enemy types gather or respond to DIY mazes or trap-paths you have carefully engineered drives the connection you have to the game. The flunky online map only compliments the randomness of enemy pathways. I only played for ~80hours with a significant portion of menu time since pressing Esc pauses the game. This is a great novelty if your used to multiplayer. The game's biggest caveat is that it is simple. I couldn't imagine playing for any longer without having to change my location and difficulty. Not being able to modify structures and manually destroying them to delete is also a drag. 

I straight up chose a difficult campsite which only became apparent when playing with some friends and seeing how quiet the map can be in other parts. MP could increase overall game time for a few more hours with team play usually requiring the need for more constructables/consumables/storage etc. Also sailing around is pretty cool. The scary elements of the game are done well and that's why you never feel completely safe with crocs, sharks, all types of mutants and cannibals that chase you down. 

Well rounded single-player game that deserves a couple of weekends. Looking forward to the sequel in September."

I didn't venture out much in the early days, but once I got more established with a base and a steady food and water supply, I started exploring the caves more, which are pretty creepy if you have the cave lighting turned down.  There is so much to explore, I'm continuing the game even after finishing the main quest.  I definitely would recommend this game, and I will buy the sequel when it comes out."

12888,"To put it simply, it's a really fun realistic survival game with the addition of cannibals attacking you every now and then... or at least attempting to. Depends on how good you are at realistic combat. Try your luck?"
12889,Cannibal titties. 10/10
12890,"wicked fun, scary sometimes"

12894,i can eat many body parts
12895,"Great game!  I was worried it would be too much farming and grinding but I felt it was decently balanced, and you could also play the story without building too much.

Getting used to the terrain and referencing the map was a bit challenging for me, just need patience.

If you're into Forest + Cave exploring with dark/scary atmosphere, this is your game. 

Horror, Gore, and a dash of Humour."

If you're a horror fan, this will be a five-star experience for you."

You can not change properly your key bindings. In 2022? Really?

Second impression:
You can not drink from a waterfall in a survival game... XD

Third impession:
I can hold my bearth longer for fun than my character when his life is at stake. XD

This game is a bad joke.

12973,"Objectively one of the best games. Think of a similar type of survival to minecraft, except much scarier, much harder, more realism and detail and a different art style. Basically your goal is to survive!

Overall I'd rate this a 9.5/10. The only thing I didn't like about it was the very occasional bug. There was a bug where the cannibals would hit me and my buddy through a wall but other than that it was really good. Very nice story and everything.

This game is fun alone but if you get like 4 maybe even 5 friends on with you, it is a whole new experience. You can turn it into a rust like multiplayer experience real quick."

12997,"The game is interesting and unique, the survival and combat is okay and could be improved but I must say that the lack of interesting exploration areas other than bland caves is quite sad. There was occasionally an interesting location but I don't feel that it is enough to justify the size of the map. I did enjoy this game but I think it could be improved and the fact that I was playing with my friends severely carried my experience"

"
13037,fun game also made me pee my pants
13038,Fantastic game. Cannot wait for the sequel. Time played is higher IRL due to spending most time offline.
13039,I've beaten this game and sure there are plenty of things you must learn with no hint (unless you wanna look it up) there is also plenty of fun experiences you and your friends can have on this game. I even suggest a single player campaign as you tackle the dangers of THE FOREST
13040,"Can't adjust smooth turning in VR. weird 3rd person jump outs when doing certain actions like climbing ropes or drinking water. Took me a long time, maybe 10 minutes, to figure out how to even get into the Options menu to adjust settings in VR. Should be more explained or notifications for VR users in the airplane starter area.

It seems like a cool idea, but not a good VR supported game.

I actually bought 4 copies of this to play with my friends, we all got about 40 minutes in and then refunded all of them. :("
13041,"Somehow I feel like this game was better back in the Alpha I pirated. The VR isn't terribly implemented but it's not really ""good"", and the game itself is pretty boring. I understand there's some cool AI stuff behind the scenes, but I think we've moved past the survival genre at this point in human history. A lot of stuff in it is pretty unintuitive and janky feeling."
13042,"Awesome. I feel like bear grylls after crashing a plane, using my survival skills from the SAS to fight some natives that kidnapped my son. Truly an immersive experience when it comes to fighting an evil corporation that shoots down planes in a remote island and were never found by the US government. 7 stars out of 5."
13043,Good graphics and I like that you can play with up to 8 people in a coop.
13044,good
13045,SUcks dick I get jumped everytime i play by the canibals and the monmsters and the aborted fetuses that kjump around and hit you. Also really hyped for the second game cant wait. 0/10 stars

Naked people attack your base everyday"

13066,the cannibals are tasty.
13067,Its like going to a nude beach but everyone has rabies.
13068,good game but kinda anticlimatic ending
13069,this game is broken in all the best ways. did your buddy join and you want to give them a weapon? fear not just pick it up at the same time! with a maximum of 8 players and public severs no matter how your playing with long time friends or random strangers its going to be a good time

13081,Very good game and big adrenanine run on the end
13082,"Fun even after completing the story, you can build a lot more than many people realise with the building and its fun to get a compound and a massive village with all your friends whilst simultaneously fighting off cannibals. And the story is very fun as well."

13086,This game is a great game for adventure and a little horror. I would recommend this game to anyone. If someone wants to get into horror of any sort this game is a good way to get into it. Overall this game is my personal favorite and I would suggest it to anyone and everyone.

13098,"being slapped by naked women. top time, usually have to pay more than ¬£5 for that"
13099,It's a really good game! And also u can play with friends! i deffenetly recomend this
13100,definetly a recommended although a few gliches do happen from time to time in caves overall a good game
13101,"So I want to start off by saying that the game is fun but the no I don't recommend this game is for the crafting system the other part of this game. things to note is the broken zip line for moving logs over long distances and the sudden explosion at the end when you come into the load range if you send over too many, the fact that this game is both single-player and multiplayer yet the large raft is useless in single-player due too needing 2 people to move it. The large raft should have just one oar in the middle of the two it already has right under the platform and ditch the two it already has. The building system for buildings is so broken it's not even laughable. Floors should be 8' X 8' squares that you place and then build and they should snap together rather then the one click and drag that you can't even put a hole in for stairs inside your house...... STUPID!. The day/night cycle is way to short. The chainsaw's fuel consumption is worse the a semi truck. There needs to be more storage options for other things in your inventory like more baskets for dynamite or other explosives, furs, ropes and so-on.

PS. Forgot to mention that the house boat's oar is backwards. you can't see where your going to the left side and the load/unload ramp is in the back in it's current configuration. Turn the oar around so that the back becomes the front and you will be able to see where your going much better and dock alot easier. Also the basic log holder 7 logs while the upgraded one holds 12 and not 14 even though there's room enough for two more logs."
13102,best game ever!!!
13103,"Server sux, hitbox sux, cannibal attack pattern sux. cheap story with unnecessary time  consuming to build basic things instead of exploring and fighting mobs. minecraft does it better in every aspect."

13166,"The island is pretty nice looking despite the games age. The enemy AI is interesting and feels somewhat lifelike, often just moving about the island and scouting the world until they find players. They communicate with each other, growl and size up the player, climb trees and perch on rocks. The enemies are simple but reactive enough that they still feel like a challenge and interesting to fight. Those are just the regular ones too.

Great decisions were made to give players options to play in creative mode and disable building destruction.

But...

How am I playing in a dark room with gamma and my monitors brightness maximized and I still can't see shit in this game
[/h1]

The sleep cooldown doesn't even line up with nighttime, so I have to wait like 5 minutes in the dark before I can skip back to day. Why is there even a cooldown on sleeping? if you simply must restrict the ability to sleep, why not just allow the player to sleep at night like minecraft?

This game is full of frustrating mechanics that seem to lack polish. Holding shift while standing still drains stamina. Sitting on a bench prevents you from crafting or using menus. Items sometimes can't be picked up. I can't pick up a story item because the item doesn't react to anything.
Cave jumpscares (bats usually) are louder than any other sound in the game for no reason. They play every time you reenter the cave or get near the entrance, and even though I know they're coming they're so loud that they still make me flinch. 
Building mechanics sometimes just don't work for no reason. I can only build regular campfires in my treehouse, but I can't build standing fires (torches). I can't align stairs on the same height as my a platform, and even trying to line it up manually is impossible because the game doesn't let you orient objects on the Z axis separately from the X/Y axis.

This game is cool but every aspect of the game has some kind of problem attached to it. They all add up to make an aggravating experience. Hopefully the sequel is more polished after the release date has been delayed

13184,"Ok so I'm pretty sure this was a Greenlight game from ages ago and they barely fart squeaked out a finished game. Still very buggy, feels like a beta. A decent time but you'll need to eventually cheese unless you want to waste a ton of your actual valuable time (life). Get it for 5 or less, check gg(dot)deals."

13188,"TLDR: looks great, feels great, crafting is minimal, enemies are repetitive, character progression is nonexistence, no weapon variety.

PSA: look at the amount of items/weapons you can craft before purchase

i want to like it but it is really boring...
played the game with a friend for a few hours, the intro gave me chills, the graphics blew me away, the crafting was neat. i made a bow, it does next to nothing to anything other than a seagull. vast open areas of nothing besides a few camps that seem to have no purpose other than a quick fight for your life with no loot other than the same club the first 50 guys dropped...but hey at-least i have leaves and sticks.

13193,Can't rebind mouse buttons.
13194,"A really good game to play on coop. Don't play it alone, you might become a mutant from that much boredom. But with your friends, it has a lot of potential, and tens of hours of quality time building/surviving the world.

Graphics are good. Game is as buggy and as glitchy as it can get. You can even skip entire parts of content by glitching through walls. But you'll come to the conclusion that this is an other good part of the game. Exploring game mechanics beyond what the developers strictly defined, is also another awesome part of it.

Other than that the game's mechanics are ... a lot. There is tons of content both in the ... forest, as well in the underground caves. Have fun searching them with your crew :)"

It's missing a bunch of QoL features that almost every other open world survival game has and that makes it pretty godawful to play.
I managed to finish it anyway but it really felt like a chore.
A lot of stuff feels half-baked or unfinished. Crafting doesn't feel very rewarding.
Building doesn't have enough interesting stuff.
There is a story and it's ok, I guess. Finishing it is what I figured to be an ok stopping point
There are better survival craft games out there, give this one a miss."

I've played multiplayer with a friend these past few days and we've both enjoyed it.
The Forest is about finding your abducted son and saving him after a plane crash.
The game is by no means one that holds your hand which leads to many hours of immersion despite the repetitive nature of the game at times.
I've not played alone but I imagine it wouldn't be as fun as co-op.
I'd easily pay full price but I also would advise waiting for a sale but The Forest is still worth your money either way."

This game is absolutely unique and a franchise that deserves all the accolades it receives. In my experience I am happy I came across other games first so as to save the best for last. The only regret one may feel once playing this game is that you will be disappointed with every other game for i have not yet discovered one that comes even close to the quality of the game play and its multiple aspects as that of The Forest. I would give it 100 stars if I could. Cant wait till the second one."

13331,"Dangers of Cocaine
Young people are surrounded by pro-drug messages in the media and on the Internet. They may try cocaine for the excitement or the experience without realizing the very real risks and consequences that come with cocaine use.

As a parent, you are your child's first and best protection against drug use. The following is information from the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) about cocaine and how to help your child say ""No"" to drug use. (Child refers to child or teen)

Cocaine use affects health and well-being
Cocaine stimulates the nervous system, causing brief euphoric feelings, increased alertness, talkativeness, and a sense of empowerment. People high on cocaine can also be sweaty, restless, and dizzy, and have nausea and vomiting. People coming down from cocaine effects may feel sad, have delusions or paranoia, and even think about suicide.

Acute effects
Cocaine use increases heart rate and blood pressure, and can lead to abnormal heart rhythms and lethal heart attacks‚Äîeven in young people who are healthy. Cocaine use can also cause seizures and strokes.

Cocaine is a very addictive drug
Cocaine is highly addictive. Cocaine use, even soon after starting, leads to loss of control over use, and strong cravings to use more and more cocaine more often. Drug use must continue regularly or else the user will have withdrawal symptoms, including lethargy, muscle weakness, irritability, slowed comprehension, and depression. Drug addiction does not have a quick and easy cure, but medical care is a very important part of addressing addiction and recovering health.

How is cocaine used?
Cocaine is sold as a powder and is usually inhaled, or snorted, through the nose. The powder also can be melted into a liquid and injected directly into a vein.

Crack is a smokable form of cocaine that is prepared from powder cocaine. Crack is relatively inexpensive. Smoking crack increases not only the rapidity and intensity of the cocaine high, but also the risk of addiction.

Signs of cocaine use
Recognizing the signs of drug use is the first step in getting help for your child, but some signs are vague. Consider cocaine or other drug use if your child

Spends less time with family and friends and more time alone or away from home
Loses contact with friends or changes friends
Is frequently irritable and argumentative, and often loses control of his behavior
Begins to skip classes, shows up late for school, or has a drop in grades
Loses interest in hobbies
Stays out all night or runs away
Develops sleep or appetite problems
Has a big change in weight or appearance
Shoplifts or steals money
Possesses drugs or drug paraphernalia, such as mirrors, razor blades, spoons, or lighters"

13395,"Great game in general, plenty to do."
13396,"As i run through this game. No, this experience. i look around me to see a wide land full of mystery and danger, the island inhabited by natives and strange sexy multi-armed and legged mutants.. i find myself absorbed in it all, my mind and imagination can run wild where it can not due to my many, many mental disabilities. i see tall blue grey men that i long for, their bodies yummy and toned. the deeper into the caves I go the more there are! i can hardly keep my excitement in as i actively search out for the mutant hotties in my area. I don't think i will or will ever want to leave this sexual paradise that is this game and the creatures within it. 9/10 game; building my sex mansion was very annoying due to the building mechanics"

13424,one of the best games ive ever played the graphics are insane i love the way you build (needing to put the blank build down first and filing it in) fuck the bats i want to murder them because every goddamn time i go in a cave i dont get scared by the MAN EATING MUTANTS BUT THE BATS SCARE THE SHIT OUT OF ME LIKE WTF
13425,"Would be  a lot more fun to play with friends. But if you like games that put you on your nerves and bring you to your limit this is it. After a few days you're gonna start surviving out of spite for the mutants. Its a cool game

13437,yes
13438,"very nice very gud
"
13439,It's a fun survival game. A little buggy however I would say worth if you can purchase it on sale
13440,That game feels like you are outside in the woods.
13441,playing coop with 3 other friends it is just like a horror movie  a whole cannibal village attacked us two pf us ran into a cave one ran into the safe house and the last one got eaten
13442,"This game is fun, but you must play this with friend"
13443,"It's a good game, tho I wish there was a way to customize the difficulty, for instance, make the survival aspect harder while not making the enemies harder. 
The survival aspect is rather easy, you wont be running out of water or food, while cannibals can overwhelm you rather quickly with their numbers.
I finish the main plot withing 22 hours, and I wasan't even looking for it. It feels fair due to the game price, but  recommend buying on a 30%+ Sale.

"
13444,"One of the best Survival multiplayer building game out there, i definitely recommend you buy this!

Or you can wait for Sons Of The Forest, the 2nd game in the series."

P.S: Game mechanics is somewhat bad."
13456,one of the most survival game
13457,Worst optimization I've seen in a game;  caves are so dimly lit even with torches or flashlights you can barely even see your own hands. Brightness slider does absolute jack to help and even with a monitor that can output 1000 nits of brightness the game is a black mess. I wish i didn't play past 2 hours so I can get my money back.

13478,◊ô◊ü◊ö
13479,"The Forest is one of the best games iv ever played. It has way too many things to do, and very F#@king scary gameplay, I couldnt even masterbate in peace in the forest alone, coz I always feel someone is looking at me from behind, sad joke I know, buts its my current life. I would have written a full review but not even my neighbor would bother reading or liking it so...

Anyways the game runs on a low end pc, a gt 730 gives 22 frames, mine to be specific, on the lowest setting. A must play for even broke players on steam sale, but not for those who hate bugs and broken ai, otherwise ""there is sons of the forest"" coming out and ""GH"" another survial game very ripped off from this game"
13480,"Very nice game, interesting story line."
13481,yes
13482,"Good game, better with friends. Has good survival mechanics, and has a nice endgame story.
Scares the shit out of me sometimes."

13524,"i get to wear an air hostess uniform and kill babies.

10/10"
13525,AMAZING
13526,"The game is a jungle survival game. You survive the game by building a house in the woods. At night, the genetic mutants can come and attack you, and you have to defend yourself against them. You can do anything you want after you've developed a little bit. I think it would make more sense to build your house by the water. Because you meet your water needs with turtle shells. There's nothing else to tell but the game is legendary. If you want it, take it.
Score for the Game: 100/100"

13534,it was fun
13535,is fun
13536,all
13537,"I've never felt so actively on edge and anxious playing a game. The way that it triggers my fight or flight instincts so perfectly is absolutely insane. It's not your typical horror at all, there's this pinch of realism to it that just makes you feel in the moment, as if you're actually there, and I'm honestly finding that I love it.

If you have friends, I highly suggest that you play this together. If you solo, I wouldn't suggest any difficulty higher than easy. Normal is not impossible, but two or three hits from an average enemy can take you completely out and most of them travel in packs of 3 to 8 so, solo at your own risk bro

overall, I give this game a 9/10 and I expect I'll be in the 1,000 hour mark in no time."
13538,"I would fuck this game and this game is  good with friends thats if yoy get any
"
13539,"good game, load of laughs"
13540,"Plane crash, very cool, people die."
13541,"love it <3
            10/10"
13542,"Game is unplayable until you get the modern bow that can 1 hit headshot the cannibals
Also the cannibals attack your base more than 3 times a day requiring you to make a trump wall to stay safe
6/10 gimme a better weapon"
13543,is v spook
13544,uh yes
13545,yujkhyh
13546,built a baler base instead of looking for my lost son 9.3/10
13547,good game
13548,Killed a lot of naked crackheads got off came back and my buddy cut down half the map and built fort nox so yeah
13549,"Actually better than I thought. I was expecting something a little more intense on the ""body maintenance"" side like having to monitor and always be attending to your characters wellbeing whilst still playing the game. Moderately difficult but a lot of that is a grind as well. Gotta stick with it! Has it's jump scares and overall creep factor but it's pretty neat really..."
13550,i love collecting bloody teeth.
13551,Yes
13552,love it
13553,fun
13554,good game
13555,nice
13556,its fun plz play
13557,"Very good game. crash plane, son die, get axe, and get to work.
(NOTE: I recommend playing on a decent graphics card as you may experience a lot of FPS stutters.) *I play on a GT 1030 on Low Graphics and it runs on 35+ FPS and around 45+ in the caves* I recommend playing on an ASUS GeForce GTX 1050 Ti, As it runs it on max settings at 50-65 or more FPS. (ive tested it).
RATING:
Graphics: 10/10
Physics: 8/10
Price: 7/10 (better to get on sale!)

Visuals: 11/10
OVERALL RATING: 10/10.

13576,"me spend 4 hour building base, it turn night, big boy mutant arrive with a gang of 6, they slaughter me and destroy house."
13577,"Feels like this never left early access; I like the concept overall but lacking some basic mechanics and the combat/movements of the cannibals and mutants just feels unpolished. It tries to lean a lot harder into the horror aspect of the game than the crafting/building/survival aspects, but after your initial encounter w/ the cannibals they aren't that freaky, just annoying to deal with."
13578,"its about naked men that stolen kid

would recommend 10/10"
13579,W game
13580,i have been watching people play this game since it came out i would 100% would say to play this game before you play the second one love the game overall great worth every penny
13581,"I have only played three hours as I write this, but so far I find it quite fun, challenging, kinda spooky and has a very easy-to-use multiplayer system. It is kind of buggy, but it makes it fun to play with friends. 9/10 would recommend"
13582,i like it
13583,really good game with an amazing story. Cant wait till sons of the forest comes out

Game could use more polish- um a lot more polish - then it be worth spending cash on....."
13780,"Extremely fun game! You can take this at your own pace. Build your camp, or dedicate your time to exploring. Definitely play with friends.


Adding on after completing game: Mind. Blowing. Ending. Just  wow. Amazing game and can't wait for part 2!!!!"

13782,god bro i get so horny when i cut up little babies and when timmy's bald ass head hits my groin it makes me so rock hard it made me ejaculate on my monitor so much i had to buy a new one.

13789,"Purchased this in 2019. Played through and beat it with my partner, but continued on to build an elaborate base and fight all sorts of specials for weeks thereafter.
It's 2022 now and I still come back to it every few months. Even if you don't play the campaign again once you've finished it, it's such a thoroughly enjoyable, well-executed, and well-conceived experience.

As a British Columbian, I'm super impressed by how accurately Endnight have recreated the beauty and moody ambience of their native British Columbia's temperate rainforests, 

I've been a gamer my whole life and an archer since 2008. This means I tend to gravitate towards any game that has a bow as a weapon... and this game still has by far the most natural, most intuitive and realistic archery I've ever played. I can't quite express how difficult that is to achieve. 7 Days, Rust, Scum, a number of other survival games I've had the pleasure of playing‚Äînone have managed to come close to The Forest in terms of accuracy in their experience of archery.

Would love to see the next iteration include some kind of community-building, similar to that in Rust.
From the moment I started my adventures in The Forest, this game has continued to be one of my top 3 favourite games of all time, and I've bought it for several friends over the years purely out of love for this game, and my compulsion to share it with as many people as I can.

Truly brilliant work, Endnight!"

spawned in with my egirl and my boy(smoky), after a bit we realized we might need a homebase. managed by the grace of God to figure out how to build stuff. we put down the build thing for the large log cabin, living nice. livin big. after 20 minutes and dying once or twice, getting chased, trying to find food. eating arms and legs, hunting down a turtle shell and getting logs. we finally have it, the home, the base, the palace some would say. 2 minutes later i cut down a tree and it falls on the log cabin. 

they werent happy.  buy this game, please."

13820,"I was minding my own business with my son Timmy, enjoying our plane flight and considering a nap because the in-flight entertainment options were kind of limited. Suddenly, our plane encountered turbulence and as is usual for such times, we went through some explosive decompression issues and ended up in one third of a plane. Good thing I pre-purchased seats in the tail section.

I woke up in my seat sometime later - alone, hungry, thirsty and with only the dead body of a flight attendant to keep me company. As is usual for such times, I immediately stole her clothing and everything I could find that wasn't nailed down. 

I then consulted my handy survival guide and built myself a hunting shelter, a fire pit and explored my immediate surroundings. Let's just say the locale was weird and apparently hostile to the other foreigners who had gone exploring before me.

On my way back to my camp / the plane wreckage, I met some emaciated locals who did not understand English. As is usual for such times, I chased them down and brutally slaughtered them with my improvised hunting implements. Harvesting their naked bodies for bones, teeth, nutritious carbohydrates, protein and fats, and heads to keep me company, I congratulated myself on a job well done. I had survived my first day in the forest!

That was some time ago. These days I'm somewhat of a local celebrity, distinguishing myself from the common rabble here by painting my body red and mashing my rivals into piles of bloody pulp with my trusty ""mace""; a large skull on a stick covered with human teeth (and the remains of those who have irked me). This impromptu vacation has really put me in touch with my best self and I sincerely hope that Timmy has found similar success in his exploits, wherever he may be.

Now, having improvised a respectable gaming computer from materials sourced here, I am preparing to play this game called The Forest. I'm not sure what it's about but as is usual for such times, I am anticipating a wholesome entertainment experience to distract me from my life of violence, subjugation and cannibalism."

"
13915,"This game rules! What's epic is how close you get to dying without actually succumbing, so you feel incredibly epic. The survival genre is often obnoxious and impossible but this game is just the right amount of hard to be enjoyable. The horror is cool because the cannibals don't feel random, their behavior seems realistic. Like once I was walking along a beach, went up a hill, and turned around and there on the beach a cannibal was just running along the beach. It was kinda creepy because it didn't seem like an ai or npc. Anyway, stellar game!"

13929,"This game is just heaps of fun, really spooky vibes at times, then at other times it's really fun to get materials and build up your base while exploring the world. The crafting and building system is really fun to me."
13930,"This is a crappy game and not at all what I thought it would be after seeing the vids on it.  I'm actually mad I wasted 6 bucks on it (guess that should have told me)  Building in the game is very awkward - time consuming - and just plain confusing.  I feel like I'm playing a game from back in the 80's . . . swinging your meager axe against the antagonists is spotty - you click and don't swing or sometimes you do - still can't figure it out how you defend yourself.  You get a bic lighter that your character will automatically try to light when it's dark or you're in a cave.  Problem is he's still trying to light it when it's daylight and you can't stop him . . . glitchy.  Everything in this game is micromanaged - for example if you want to drink clean water you have to find a pot and boil it. . . you can't get a pot until after you've dispatched cannibals - dispatching cannibals is a cluster****

Your char. is constantly hungry and thristy - you spend more time trying to locate food items which rapidly spoil on you and you can't keep it on your inventory until you get a drying rack - good luck getting to make that before they find you and you're in some cave trying to get back to camp which has a cannibal in hiding waiting to take you out.

You die - game over - no respawning - have to go back to a prev saved file.  (again just like 80's games)  Overall, the game was a good idea ruined by poor execution and horrible game play.  Wouldn't buy this for a dollar.   Truth be told - I've only played the game for roughly 5 hours.  (4 of which were in peaceful mode) I don't know if I can get my money back as I've never felt the need to do so (but I'm gonna try)

Don't buy - just look at it and move on."

I got stuck in a hole and there were no stairs, the guy instead build stairs built rocks for me to get out but he should have built stairs instead (the rocks were at a bad angle). I couldn't get out, and the guy started acting toxic and playing like he was the king of the island. Also threatening to kill us just to troll us. He killed me with a gun just to be toxic. If you build a mega castle or base, don't act like you're the supreme king of the island, don't even get in character. Just be nice.

14061,"One of THE BEST GAMES I have ever played. The graphics, sound effects, the animations, everything is perfect. Would 100% recommend to anyone."
14062,"I wouldn't recommend this game unless you have a high to Gmod or SFM FNAF youtube videos, and I'm not going to explain myself any further than that."
14063,I beat the game. Its a fun journey but boring after end game.
14064,worst vr port ive ever played in my life

I can't play this game for longer than 10 minutes before my PC goes blank and restarts."

14069,"[h1]This game has ADHD[/h1]
It's got great aspirations, but it tries to do too many things at once, but doesn't complete any of them, so the whole product suffers. I have no idea why this has ""Overwhelmingly Positive"" reviews (at the time of my purchase and of this review).  Here are a few of the reasons I wouldn't recommend this to anyone.
[hr][/hr]
[b]Crafting [/b]- The crafting system is unclear and difficult/frustrating to navigate. Half of the things you can build or create are in your guidebook, and the other half are cryptically available as you put items into your crafting area. [i]Is that a Chicory, Coneflower, or a Marigold icon? Where the heck do I find Aloe Vera?[/i]

[b]Harvesting[/b] - It takes 89 logs to make a cabin, 4-5 logs per tree, 15-20 chops with your tiny axe each, (about 300 chops to get only the logs. Need Sticks? You can find them on the ground, and saplings give you 2, you need 21 to do this one small thing. And no, [i] you can't break logs down into sticks.[/i] Need Food? Just go kill and chop up a cannibal, then eat them. It lowers your sanity, but sanity [i] literally means [u]nothing[/u][/i]. So the bad guys are literally just food with zero consequences. They're way easier to find, and they deliver themselves!

[b]Enemy/Combat System[/b]  - The enemy difficulty curve goes really high, very quickly. There's very little in the way of time to learn how the mechanics work, before you get called to dinner by the locals,  tonight's special could be you, or them.

7 Days to die does all of these so much better, and so much more on top of that. Honestly, don't waste your time or money on this one.

14077,I love eating feet and familys
14078,"With all the raving reviews, I was really hoping to enjoy this game. I'm not sure if it's due to playing so many crafting games, too high of expectations, or both but I was very disappointed. I really enjoy crafting games and this was quite underwhelming."

14107,"I am 42.

My ex-wife and I have a daughter together, and adopted our son together. They are now both 4 years old.

When we were going through our separation, I found myself lost and miserable. I was self destructive. I got so mad one day from everything spiraling out of my control that I punched some concrete in a moment of overwhelming emotion. That caused me to break my 5th metacarpal in my right hand... my working hand... my games hand.. the hand that I held and carried my children to bed with.. The hand I desperately needed to make sure I could continue to provide.

After learning of the severity of my self-inflicted damage, I was borderline suicidal. Keep in mind that just a few months before this, I was the happiest man with no history of depression or anxiety. I have never had fits of rage, or been one to break down and cry, but I was in a low spot that just really buried me from being able to see the light on the other side.

Having nothing better to do, I searched for a game I could play, ONE HANDED while I recovered. I somehow stumbled upon this game and read some of the reviews. I decided that it had to be worth a shot... I must admit, I didn't beat the game, or play nearly as long as some of you. In fact, I may have only played this game a day or two.. With that being said, after doing so, I had a new found joy and hope for life. I was able to put behind me the pain and suffering that had been cast over me. I was able to experience other peoples joy and happiness. I was able to see the fruits of my ""labor"". I relaxed for 5 ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•ing minutes to this music long enough to realize that I was going to be okay.

After coming to that realization, I turned the game off, and I went back to work. It hurt my hand like hell but I was motivated. I stopped feeling so damn sorry for myself, and I became the father I needed to be in that moment, not the weak boy I was behaving as.
Today, I am close friend with my kids mother. We don't fight, or argue, or say hurtful things to each other. We are parents, and friends.

I now have 3 kids. My third child is, wait for it, ALSO 4 YEARS OLD. The woman I am with was going through a very similar situation at the time of my own separation, and we just stumbled in to each others life unexpectedly. We have been in a relationship for a year now, and are very happy together.

Moral of the story, you never know what life holds in store for you, and if I would have given up when all the odds were stacked against me, I wouldn't be where I am today. This silly little game helped me realize that.

Thank you."
14108,a modern survival horror masterpiece

14117,"how to deal with the ooga boogas: Run at them and click as fast as u can with the axe, spear is mid unless ur fishing. ez."
14118,good game
14119,"I first played this game while alone for 10 minutes, saw a cannibal and quit to windows. Then I returned months later and streamed it and had an amazing time.

 Definitely one of the best survival games out there, and learning to manage resources and fight mutants was great fun. I initially thought the story was going to fall flat and that people were just praising the sandbox, but the story is great too and I am looking forward to the sequel."

14134,"At first, one naked lady,
then 2 naked ladies...
then 10 leaders...
then 10000000000000 armsies

I would recommend to play with friends because the game feels a bit more fast paced when their are attacks but then nice and calm when your just building your base.
Multiplayer: 4/5 - It can be a bit glitchy saying ""Host not Responding"" when they are
Combat: 4.5/5 - On normal it is still challenging
Survival: 5/5 - The Food, Water and infection are very good in the way they play out

Overall, a 9.5/10 rating for me!"

14314,"Steam again fails with their ridiculous warranty of a paltry  120 minutes ""Playing time"". The AI governing the playtime measurement has a mind of its own and records as playtime when I'm not even running the programme but have the Steam app open on my desk top. Do not risk your money with this one as they refused to refund me despite my attempting to overcome the bugs in it AND NOT playing it for the 4 hours they claimed. My true play time was less than 2 hours the rest was wasted trying to solve the problems I had with it. The only play time involved was with Steam messing with me, so my faith in Steam as a professional company just died."

14316,"After about 45 minutes, this didnt get any better. The game looks like it was made in 2001 graphics wise, and compared to other survival games, is pretty basic. Get it on sale, I got it for 5.99 and I'd refund it if I had payed any more."

14332,yes
14333,"I bought this game while it was discounted by 70% (less than ¬£5) which seemed a good deal and was little to lose if it didn't live up to my expectations. Generally I am not a fan of survival games as they bore me or have toxic MP environments however this one I have monitored for quite some time so thought it worth trying out.

So far I am in the early stages of this game having racked up a trivial 1 hour and still trying to get  familiar with the controls, building, hunting, exploring and staying alive. Those cannibals, the human type, have given me a rough time but not deterred me from venturing out. I read that around the 7 day mark I will eventually meet more aggressive, violent, mutant cannibals which I'll have to deal with. Here's hoping I can survive that.

I managed to find the yacht quite by accident which has become my temporary base to save games and rest till I explore further and decide on where I want to locate and build my home base. Having read a couple of guides, it matters where you build it, so will take than into consideration before I do anything.

The graphics are pretty good. Being stared down by a cannibal or a group of them can be unsettling as you're left thinking if they will attack or run away. Night brings its own problems as you're limited on how far you can see with your lighter plus you're vulnerable to being attacked before you can react.

I have not yet tried co-op, just single player so far. I look forward to joining with a friend later to see how this goes.

In all, I am quite impressed with the game and would recommend it."

14348,"I like the game itself, the theme is very cool. But there are a couple of issues game-play wise. For a starters, the location where you crashed your plane randomises every time you start a new game. Also there is a very big immersion killer, the location where the rear of the plane crashes (the starting point) dose not in any way shape or form look like a plane smashed into the ground, all the trees, bushes or even the ground itself look intact, the rear half of the plane looks like it was teleported there. That's a strong dislike. The second issue i have encountered with the gameplay is even under ""normal"" difficulty the enemy NPCs are extremely overpowering still, you as a normal human take swings with the axe quite slowly so you end up beaten up and dragged into their lair very easy. The enemy NPCs should technically die from a blow to the head or have a high chance of a limb cut off or severely injured but they somehow take many hits and you simply get beaten up. I'm talking about the human looking creatures, nothing else. I had to literally switch to peaceful mode just to get some sort of game play going on. There is not a very good balance between the beasts and you. 

There is certainly a big thumbs up for creepy and scary AF, very detailed body parts and gore is present, the character looks and feels realistic especially when you are covered in blood. I am not sure what the plans are with this game but i shared my concerns, you may consider it on sale which means you only loose about 10 dollars. I do suggest the concerns to be addressed to make it more enjoyable"

14445,"This game has a lot of potential, but fails utterly to meet its mark and is NOT WORTH 20 something dollars. The resource cost for buildings and the damage enemies do to your buildings needs a major rework. Structures/shelter take too many resources to build and is too easily destroyed by late-game enemies. Another issue is the building damage function. When an enemy hits a building unit to the point it breaks, usually your entire structure collapses, making the game extremely frustrating because the cost to build protection (a feature I really like about the game) far outweighs your actual protection from danger and leads too enemies destroying your fortifications with ease (one enemy destroyed an entire Alpine Tree-Fort with one hit). However, the quest line is entertaining and your enemies are always keeping you on your toes."

14486,"If you like exploration this game is pretty cool. There are a lot of secrets in the game. Building is a bit wonky at times, but you have a lot of options and items for crafting. The story is quite nice, you have to sort of piece things together yourself based on things you find on the island - other plane members, photos and drawings that give you hints to other places or pieces of the story. Also, you'll find various caves - some are simple, some are complicated and big, there's an interesting twist to some of the caves and places you see. Overall good game. If you appreciate survaval and exploration games I think this one is definitely worth a try."

14494,"Underwhelming.

Rather than make it a gradual buildup, they throw you into the game with a complete blueprint set for setting up a base, but the UI was so confusing I didn't realize that fact until it was already getting dark. Had enough time to set up a fire and shelter, tried using the drying rack but found out small meat cannot go on the drying rack, resorted to eating snacks and soda. Now I'm just huddling around my camp unable to sleep until morning, while I fight off endless number of annoying cannibals that are spawning at the beach I'm on. It's been night time for what feels like half an hour now, just swinging my axe and taking damage. It feels pointless. Can't even build walls because the cannibals don't leave you alone.

Did I do something wrong? Is this how the game is meant to go or am I being punished by The Forest??

Edit: After wasting some more time trying to play this game I have requested a refund. This game is just frustration from the cannibals making dumb noises to the slow af building mechanics, it's just not fun. I'd rather start a new Minecraft Survival world. That's essentially what it is really, minecraft with realistic graphics, and terrible UI. Spent the hole time convinced that the game wanted me to learn how to play, but every time I asked the door was closed in my face. 2/10"

All of us bereaved fathers desperately searching for our baby boy Timmy while building a new life slaughtering cannibals for effigy parts.  Our ultimate goal to not only find our dear son, but to build the epitome of trap mazes that turns a survival horror game into a tower defense game.

The Forest is one of the funnest games I've ever played and I keep going back to it, with friends and solo.  I can't wait for the sequel and I hope the devs take all the time they need before releasing it, although I'm also looking forward to a little of the same jankiness this game has to help keep me on my toes."

14659,"Really good survival game spilled with a huge map, crafting, horror and an okay story. I played with the Early Access version back when it first launched and I already liked it. The game is now finished, has a proper story and you can play trough it without any issues. Not gonna lie, when I started playing the game I got addicted to it so much, that I only put it down when I got all the Achievements, and finished the story itself. Since then, I never really touched it. So I completed it on normal and decided to give it another try on Hard difficulty with my dudes. It's a little bit hard for them, because they just started playing it and never knew anything about the game, but they're at least enjoying it. I don't exactly know if I would complete this game alone once again, it's more fun and faster with other players.

14695,this game is so creamy
14696,"Extremely fun and exciting game. My friends and I played for hours a day every day because you can focus on different genres of the game. If you like discovery, explore the caves. if you like combat, find cannibal camps. If you like crafting and design, build walls and keep the enemies out while you relax. Not only that but you can play by yourself, with friends, and with strangers. It's not only a survival game, the plot is immensely deep and interesting. Not to mention smaller things like sliding down the sinkhole and little exploits that make the game way more fun, like making infinite bullets so that you can have much more fun with friends."
14697,"Really fun start so far. Only complaint is that it's hard to remember what's bound to my hotkeys without a little action bar on the bottom of my screen.

Update 2022-05-18
--------------------------
Still super fun, especially with friends to take the edge off! Definitely my favorite take on the survival-crafting genre so far. The enemies are terrifying and challenging, especially when the action economy gets tilted. Resource gathering is often simultaneously intense and disconcerting, beautiful and relaxing. Base-building is so exciting! Planning out fortifications and traps, incorporating new weapons we've learned to make into how we plan our defensive structures. And omg, discovering new enemies. Devs are super creative, and each enemy feels worthy of considering when planning a build. Seriously love the game.
Some notes:
- Some sounds are too loud relative to other sounds (defensive wall gates opening, build complete, structure repaired, maaaybe water splashing too). The rest of the foley is amazing! Especially the wind!
- Controls feel a little inconsistent, e.g. sometimes putting something down is done with G & other times with C. Eating meat is done with right-click, but eating a snack or drinking something uses left-click.
- Can't easily reorder quick-slotted items. E.g. if I want to move my axe to slot 4 (where, say, my meds are) from slot 1, I can't just combine the axe and backpack to re-slot it. I first have to replace the axe with a different item, then put it where the meds currently are, then put the meds where the axe used to be.
- I tried to boil water when it was raining and my pot duplicated itself. Was frustrating 'cause my water meter was flashing red, but the water couldn't boil due to the glitch. Thought this might be caused either by the pot trying to fill itself with rainwater while already being full of fresh water, or by the meat cooking on the fire; basically something causing the fire state to update & trigger some sort of refresh.
- Would love to see some light RPG stat elements, OR perk trees. Ideally things that just marginally improve QOL - faster movement, slower metabolism, improved stamina... just tiny things to help the passage of time and improvement of skills sink in"

14750,"Played for 2 hours with my friends and the game is actually really good considering it's price and amount of storage it takes but I have a serious issue with it, when there is no host of the game you played you can't access this world on your own. It basiacally means, you have to play on another save and start everything over when you want to continue playing on your own.  Can't belive I payed for this piece of crap."

14752,"I absolutely love The Forest, great atmosphere, amazing mix of survival and horror, with no scripted jumpscares. 10/10, it's a 50/10 when you play with friends, but the VR support is not very good, My main problem with the VR support is that is has a set height, which you then are forced to stay at, and if you attempt to crouch down in real life, it just makes you permanently taller, which makes it even harder to reach the ground, and it has no strength stat or weapon speed stat, it also takes no stamina to swing a weapon."

14793,"I am a 45 yo father, probably one of the oldest people playing this game. I am a single father to my Son, who is 14 now. My son got this game for Christmas in 2021 from his uncle, so we installed it on his computer and he started playing. By the end of the week he had 24 hours on this game. This was horrible for me, as it was already hard for me to find ways to spend time with my son, as he is always out with his friends or just watching YouTube. So i decided to make a Steam account and get this game to see if I could maybe play alongside him. I loaded into the game, picked my character and world and started playing but I was stuck on what you where supposed to do. I asked my Son for help and he hosted a game for me to join. I loved it as it was the best time I had spent with my Son since my wife had died. This game has ever since brought me and my son closer again and now we actually spend time together outside the house together as well. This game reminded me that there's fun to be had in everything, and it has brought both me and my Son many happy memories"

14923,very fun
14924,"I'm an imperialist on an island full of indigenous people who I can recklessly commit genocid uh I mean spread my freedom to. What's not to love? This game should be called Deforestation by the time I finish with it coz that's exactly what I did. It's a free market baby, capitalism rules! woohoo! 

On a serious note I'm glad Endnight is pushing the Sons of the Forest, I'm excited and glad to know they're not rushing into the sequel."
14925,"It's a really fun game, but it's very laggy and the graphics could be better. But all in all it's a great game!"
14926,"""You should be looking for Timmy"""
14927,"If you don't suffer from severe anxiety I'd say this game is for you! It's super fun Co-op!
However, one thing that bothers me (a person with anxiety) is that ""peaceful mode"" claims there's no enemies and yet enemies still spawn (which stresses me out since they shouldn't be there). You might think peaceful mode defeats the purpose but sometimes I want to enjoy the building mechanics without worrying about cannibals and mutants.

So not too happy about that aspect... But if you don't care about that sort of thing, this game is great! 10/10 recommend."

14930,Like rtx minecraft but if airplane trays fell out of trees and half the time you crash and lose all your progress because the only way to save is by building something expensive in game which makes exploring completely nonviable for lower hardware players. 10/10

14945,"The Forest is my favorite take on the survival craft genre. While you have options in game to play forever, it does have an actual ending you strive for. I am a bit boring and like these kind of games to have some form of closure. The story telling from the corpses, pictures and documents you find create some amazing lore and make exploring the little nooks extra worth it. The game is kind of separated into two different layers.  Base building, hunting, gathering and stocking up on items for the caves is all done on the surface. The meat of the game will be surviving the caves, which is where most of the story items and lore are presented. It was a good balance of survival craft and exploration, and even more fun with friends. I did find the game to be too visibly dark for my liking, and changed the color scheme later on (there are quite a few options). I recommend the game for anyone enthusiastic about crafting while simultaneously craving the horror elements that the game presents."
14946,"I can't by any means recommend this game.
It's unfinished.
It's unpolished.
It's buggy as hell.

14973,"I love the horror genre- movies, videogames, books, etc. I don't get scared easy but my god I can't play this game more than 30 minutes at a time. As of this review, I'm 18 hours in and have barely accomplished anything. I went on one long expedition around the island and haven't left again. Every time I chop trees, build a fire, or even think about exploring, the nightmare cannibal acrobats swarm through the trees or I see a chieftan strolling nearby. I'm constantly retreating back to my minimalist hunting lodge stuck between 2 boulders at the base of a cliff on a lake. One time when I was checking on my rabbits then heard a horrible screeching echoing through the field. I never noped so fast. I can't wait for the sequel so I can never finish that one either."
14974,My friend said the picture advertising the forest with the woman and her legs makes it look like she was raped.
14975,"The best survival co-op game out there.

Base building is great, lots of different customization that you can do. 

The cannibals/mutants AI are great. They feel alive, and appear that they think like real people.

The game can feel really immersive. (Especially if you turn off overlay in the settings)

Definitely worth the money. I hope the sons of the forest will be a great game as well."
14976,good
14977,good game
14978,good with friends. grinding for wood/rocks is mind numbing.
14979,"I want to start this review saying that I have not yet beat the game because it does have a story but its not completely required to do unless you're in to completing stuff like that. I have 51 hours on record as of right now at the time of my typing up my review of this game there will be no spoilers so don't worry about that when reading my review. I want to say first and for most that this is a great entry level survival game for new comers or people that have little time playing the survival genre although this game is very big it on its survival side of game play its also a survival horror you will be facing up against cannibals on a forest type island after the plane that you and you're kid is on crashes. This game has some great survival elements for newcomers of the genre you will be doing things like keeping yourself fed and hydrated there are a few different ways to to do this you can find soda, or find clean water streams to drink from or make rain catchers and get your water that way as for food you can hunt for it after obtaining or crafting a weapon that you could use to hunt you can also sometimes find energy bars and other types of food left behind by people that has came to island and encountered the cannibals, the cannibals seem to horde peoples stuff that they kill. The other survival elements that are present in the game is being able to build pre made or custom log cabins with building the custom way you have the option to make huge home bases with defense's and loads of traps and other forms or home protection if you're not into making huge detailed bases then there are three sets of pre built cabins you can place and all you need is to cut down trees and find the other materials to build it it shows you how much of each thing you need to complete it. There is also temporary shelters you can build and save at if you like moving around you can also make garden plots and grow you're own food and herbs that help you heal and have more stamina etc. there is also meat drying racks to where you can basically make you're own jerky that don't spoil and go bad there are loads of decorations you can put up in and outside of you're house there are a few different types of fires you can make to stay warm, rock walls you can use to wall off your land there are also lots of useful items you can craft for your house that you can use like fireplaces that's built out of stone, tables, chairs, couches if you play with friends there is armor racks and weapon displays among other things. The next thing that i want to talk about is the map and different biomes there are a few different in the game as far as terrains there is a snow area, a woods area, deep forest areas, islands, and a more vegetated and floral area each with the own uniqueness to them. There are also caves on the island but i would not recommend trying to live in them they are a part of the story and there will be lots of hostile encounters in them. Each biome has plenty to explore and lots of different things to find  and see the graphics are not bad I use a 3070 and that's way over the recommended specs to run the game i use to run the game on my non gaming laptop at low graphics and it was just fine so that should give you some context it don't take much to run this game at the highest settings I also played this game when i had my 2070 super in my rig and it ran it at the highest graphics the graphics on a visual level is very good they aren't like some super crazy graphics but they are visually pleasing at high to very high settings. The story is very mysterious and compelling there are no cut scenes or anything like that but its more of figure it out yourself type of game you get and find clues along the way and you have to put it together which there is a end game to story which I'm still trying to figure out its not hard you just get distracted by other things to do in the game but so far the story is good and interesting.  I would recommend this game to people looking for a open world survival horror or a person that is just now getting into survival games that have actual survival elements and game play in the game even if you're a seasoned vet at survival games you will enjoy this game  and its also a affordable game as well. my overall thoughts on the game is that its a great open world survival game with lots of things to do all the while having a horror vibe to it which i really enjoy and that the new Sons of the forest follow up game is going to be amazing after playing this. Thank you for reading my review i post reviews on games that i really enjoy only so be on the look out for me in other review sections."
14980,Play with your friends so you can hear each other scream like little girls

14988,"This game was such a fun game. Recently my friends mother had passed away and he didn't interact with much people after it. He would play many so many steam games like The Forest to deal with the stress, so i decided to buy it and play alongside him. it took me a while to get used it but it was so fun. Thank you so much for developing this game. 10/10"

15053,"If you're looking for a review on this game you've come to the wrong place, but if you're looking for an outstanding pie recipe you've come to the right place.

Ingredients:

1. 6 tablespoons unsalted butter
2. 1/2 cup white sugar
3. 1/2 cup brown sugar
4. 1/4 cup water
5. 1/4 teaspoon cinnamon
6. 1 pinch salt
7. 5 apples - peeled, cored and sliced
8. 1 pastry for double-crust pie

Directions:

1. Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C).
2. Combine butter, white sugar, brown sugar, water, cinnamon, and salt in a saucepan over medium heat. Bring to a boil, remove from heat and set aside.
3. Roll out half the pastry to fit a 9-inch pie plate. Place bottom crust in pie plate; pour in apple slices.
4. Roll out top crust into a 10-inch circle. Cut into 8 (1-inch) wide strips with a sharp paring knife or pastry wheel. Weave the pastry strips, one at a time, into a lattice pattern. Fold the ends of the lattice strips under the edge of the bottom crust and crimp to seal.
5. Pour butter-sugar mixture over top of pie, coating the lattice, and allowing any remaining sauce to drizzle through the crust.
6. Bake in the preheated oven for 15 minutes. Reduce heat to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C), and bake until the crust is golden brown, the caramel on the top crust is set, and the apple filling is bubbling, 35 to 40 more minutes. Allow to cool completely before slicing."

15063,good
15064,This game's ability to create a rapture like event like every time you think your safe is the magic every other game should be aiming for!
15065,Great game when played with friends
15066,"If I could put a maybe on this I would. The Forest makes me feel good and bad. It‚Äôs a good game with friends and has great story telling moments like how some people went insane and formed their own groups. Whilst letting the player discover hidden secrets of the island without shoving it in their face. And tidbits of info for the player so they don‚Äôt get lost. But I‚Äôd be lying if I said it was a 10/10. The game feels very dull and there‚Äôs not much to do on the building side of things. One thing I love about survival games is build but this game doesn't give me a reason to. Sure, I'll build a storage box and maybe a house. But walls, tree houses, and traps? That‚Äôs not needed. Honestly even the enemies in the game don‚Äôt pose a challenge. Especially when you find the katana or chainsaw. The most difficult thing I‚Äôve had was the boss fight and that‚Äôs it. So if you're looking for a strong story with grim moments and a great atmosphere then this is it. But if you're going for building, then keep looking."
15067,"Absolute blast of a game to play with friends,even tho i become a psychopath with the traps and the custom effigies, fiance is  concern after seeing me kill thousands of cannibals and chop of their limbs for effigies i make in a flower shape 10/10"

Very cool customization capacity, & genuinely an awesome game all in all. Story is great, always have fun playing & always with others.

Edit: In the end the game 'ended' feeling a little hollow. Though we had fun piecing the story together, the 'main' ending was a little shallow. [spoiler]Not just that though, the group of friends I played with ended up making a choice which wasn't really an ending at all and we ended up having to watch a youtube video to even see the ending 'cuz we couldn't go back.[/spoiler] A little disappointing but otherwise the game was quite good."

If your a fan of survival and horror games I highly recommend although there isn't much horror it is more jump scares. definitely recommend buying thought. worth the price."
15135,I streamed this game a bit on witch and besides freezing my fingers off i loved it. cant wait for the second one.
15136,cool game
15137,"Do you like survival games with a hidden story? Do you wish Stephen King would direct your nightmares? Do you enjoy waking up to the sound of howling cannibals outside your front door? Do you like crafting weapons out of the bones of your enemies and armor from their flesh?

If you said yes to two or more of these questions, then this pretty little game is just for you! For a small chunk of change, you too can jump at every shift in the breeze and crackle of branches. Come in to THE FOREST."

15171,"Even on the hardest difficulty, it's really easy to beat this game in less than 1 hour without ever building anything. You don't even get punished for dying to the final boss, you just get to keep respawning until it's dead, without even restarting the fight. That being said, it's pretty good if you're unfamiliar with survival games, and I'd still recommend it. Hopefully the sequel is a bit more difficult."
15172,"I got this 
*Dies*
I don't got this"
15173,"Me to my friend playing as the black character with armor fashioned from many bones of many murders:
Why do you look like a voodoo Thomas Jefferson?
Him: I look like a what???

Later.
Same friend: Do we play this game because we're psychopaths, or does playing this make us psychopaths?
Me: OH A BASEBALL! (hits a bird out of the air).

Shortly later.
Me: If we went to central park and started playing baseball with the pigeons, do you think we would be arrested?
Him: Yes.
Me: When are we going to central park?

Later.
Deadfall trap instantly kills cannibals.
Us: Laughing for 5 minutes.

Conclusion: I enjoy this game."

15179,"I just can't get into this game. Survival games like Green Hell and Stranded Deep are vastly superior. The mutants aren't scary. I Leeroy-Jenkin's them the first time I encountered them, killed 4 with the indestructible omni-tool you literally start the game with, and they became just an occasional annoyance. The world feels empty; compare it to those two aforementioned games where every inch of the world is positively wriggling with fauna and flora. And for some reason, you can't pick up most food items, just snarf them down from the floor. I don't understand how this game is ""overwhelmingly positive"". It sucks."

If you have ever watched someone play this and are thinking that you would be really good at this game and that it doesn't scare you well, when you're in the game you have a whole different experience! It's more scary and exciting and knowing that there is something out there it just makes you scared but not in the bad horrific way in the fun way! I love this game so much, I recommend it to any horror lovers. I do recommend that you buy it near Christmas because it has an awesome deal! I love the scare you get, and you should 100% get this game!"
15233,"A very cool game to play with your friends. The mechanics aren't that difficult and you don't need an external guide to understand everything this game has to offer. Exploring is fun, building a base is fun, fighting cannibals is fun. Overall, this game is at least an 8,5/10 in my opinion."

15246,"good game
"
15247,"A perfect game, if you're into it.
This game is most definitely not for everyone. You should know what you're getting into before playing. It contains violence, gore, horror and cannibalism.
Despite or because of that, the gameplay-experience is just marvelous. You get stunning visuals, immersive AI-enemies, an extremely thought-out and detailed map, an ominous story, diverse tools and hundreds of opportunities for different play-styles.
tldr; know what you're getting into and enjoy this masterpiece"
15248,Perfect game to go insane with your friends

"
15255,One of the best Horror/Survival games out there
15256,"I am a big fan of survival builders and the freedom of building is amazing. It is the entire reason I downloaded and started playing. The combat can be a little wonky/unrealistic but hey this is a fictional game. The visuals are beautiful at max graphics and it is all around fun. If there were more buildings/stations that could be crafted I would rate this a 5/5 but as of right now 4/5 for the freedom, beauty, and horror this game has."
15257,i like it!
15258,"Decides to enjoy a relaxing night beside my campfire....Hears crazy laughter/noises.....Thinks it must be nothing
Please let it be nothing.....Not now.......please no......

In the corner of my eye I see a light....why ...whyyyyy....I looked.....it is a crazy thing hunched with flaming skulls staring at me from a far....... Whyyy....whyyy...I run to it hacking it with my axe until it's dead.....after I killed it I think to myself how of a savage I have become...shame on me.....but dammit I am afraid...

very afraid haha......I told myself...if I hear this sound one more time i'm leaving haha.....5 seconds later I heard it and said nah I'm out ... bye Felecia...

15282,"Looking for a crazy, creepy and disturbing but great game to play with friends? Look no further. Will you ever find Timmy? Our group gave up on finding our son and just tried to survive the insanity. The gathering of plants and fungi in the game makes it a bit more realistic, watch out for those poisonous mushrooms! All in all the game is great and gets a 5 out of 5 from me. Timmy on the other hand will be left to rot in the forest for eternity."
15283,Sons of The Forest.....HYPE!!!!!

15285,"Only 109 minutes and I feel like I've been through a game that has no building limits; the reason why everyone loves minecraft! It gives you a great feeling to be limitless, with a true challenge. There is actual story, enemy progression, and my personal favorite, the reason why this game was made for an adult audience; Dismembering and Cannibalism (I have not gotten far in the game, that's all I know.) The horror factor of this game is quite satisfying- for me, its perfect. The night is pitch black, there is voice chat, and the fact that you starve so quickly is nice, practically being constantly on edge for what you will catch next. Great game in general.
Thanks."

Just exploring the caves with my friend in VR was worth the price. What a great atmosphere, building a fire to warm up, building bone armour, crafting arrows, loved it.

I will buy the sequel day one if VR is included. If not, I hope they add it later and you will have my money when you do.

15423,its fun and challenging
15424,"I don't get the hype.. I came into this really expecting some great, polished gameplay and left utterly confused how the game has above an 80% rating.

Character progress is minimal, item gathering & base building feel uninspired, the monsters weren't that interesting, the world map felt very empty besides some preplaced events.  I had really high hopes given such great reviews but felt like it completely lacked in the ""survival"" category.  Maybe the entire focus is the story, but gameplay wise it just felt really cheaped and overlooked.

My personal favorite survival games are: 7 Days to Die, ARK, Don't Starve, Kenshi, Rimworld, Terraria, Valheim"
15425,W game btw yall should play it
15426,its all fun games until in the middle of the night someone naked starts yelling at you

15432,"Whilst I'm sad the devs abandoned the game without truly finishing it, the gameplay is still good enough to keep me coming back for more."
15433,"Good survival game, story line is interesting, building is hectic but if are playing with friends it's fun."
15434,cannibals are yummy
15435,good shit
15436,"It's a fun game, with friends. Alone the time required to build any structure of decent size is unreal. The overall jankyness of most mechanics can make the game really annoying to play, ie hit boxes, poor lighting, and god-awful building system makes it player vs game, and not player vs enemy. If you're looking for a survival grind and are able to put up with what feels like a dated game, then totally recommend. But if you don't like having to tolerate poor game design then find another game to play."
15437,Remember the only way to beat the cannibals is to eat the cannibals

15448,"Buy this game if you like walking around in the woods bored out of your mind in ""peaceful mode"" or play ""normal mode"" with (cannibals that act more like zombies) of which make the game really challenging to the point where it strips the fun out of the game as if it ever had any to begin with.  Yet another hyped up game that caught my eye on YT....oh well another dumpster fire to add to the hot dumpster juice games section."

15463,5/10 why

15465,"This was a good game with just the right amount of jank and terrible crippling glitchiness. The storyline really blows though. Shoulda had more clues, or more interactive story 'hints', ex: more tapes, or audio cassettes.
Also, the cave map was just terrible and frustrating.

The music in this game got REALLY awesome when I found ""something.""
AMAZING stuff. The music guy > your entire dev team, rofl.

Story was such a letdown though. 8.5/10. Sucked the life out of me, but, beat the game rather quickly."

15481,"Writing this review while waiting for meat to be dried.

10/10"
15482,"This game is amazing, simply put. I absolutely love the crafting and building aspect., which is pretty extensive, but not so much as to be overwhelming. The game is indeed playable solo, but be prepared to suffer through monotonous tasks, such as gathering lumber and rocks for hours on end, its much more enjoyable with a party.  You can set out to complete the story as quickly as possible, or build up a main base to add comfort and security on those long, dark nights. The intricate cave systems are actually pretty scary at times. It took a little while to get used to hacking up bodies, but the bones are worth the mental instability that you will surely suffer. This is the epitome of a survival horror game and I strongly recommend this to anyone who also enjoys crafting and building."
15483,its cool
15484,Happened to my friend eric
15485,Must play for everyone ..... amazing journey. One of the best single player and multiplayer experiences.

15490,"I love to hop on this game whenever I feel the urge to go on a camping trip with my family! If you enjoy beautiful father and son relationships, roughing it in the wild, and meeting new potential friends... this game is for you. You can focus on survival, building, decorating, treasure hunting, fighting, or getting the attention of some beautiful women with legs that will drive you wild! 10/10 For every kind of gamer."

15496,Cannibal Titties. 5/5.
15497,Nice but recommended with teammates its a lot more fun that way
15498,I want to play it forever
15499,"The Forest is a reasonable length survival horror game.  If you've played Green Hell, it's similar to that but with a lot less micromanagement and a stronger emphasis on exploration, combat, and horror.  They are similar enough that if you enjoy Green Hell, it's fairly safe to say you'll enjoy the forest - the forest is the less hardcore of the two (and my favorite between the two).

Co-op is fun (though often tense when caving) - I usually just host from my game rather than running a dedicated server.  Only thing that took us a bit to get was that we assumed only the host had to save their game - EVERYBODY has to save.

It also plays well in VR - and you can play mixed VR/non-VR when playing co-op.  Like many games, there isn't exact parity between VR and non-VR players.  VR players can attack faster and more accurately, timing a strike to interrupt an enemy is way easier when you're swinging your arm, and there's no glare in a VR headset so generally VR players have better nightvision.  On the other hand, inventory management and crafting is way easier with mouse and keyboard.

On to some of the details...

If base building is your thing and you're just looking for a game to build a fantastic palace in, few things you need to know that might be a hangup for you.  Settling down in one place permanently means at some point the island's cannibals will figure out where you hang your hat and start trying to take you out.  They don't patrol entirely randomly.  They are fairly organized - and once you start a war with them and they're beating on your wall ever other night, moving out is the only way to end it.  They can definitely damage any structure you put up.  On the other hand, building structures is fairly free-form - it'll be some variety of log cabin probably, but you'll be able to define the shape and get moderately creative.

Up to the player if the cannibals being able to zero in on you means you live on the run, or you build and maintain defenses, or you build multiple small bases scattered in relatively out of the way locations and just swap to another if you get discovered near one.  Construction is optional, but drying racks, rainwater collectors, storage - they're convenient.  At the very least you won't get through the game without the occasional campfire.

There's also a slow escalation of violence - your first few run-ins with the locals might just be them shouting and making threatening gestures.  Even when they get violent you can often drive them off by hitting them with a stick once or twice.  You'll kill some soon enough though (pretty much need to when caving), and they'll know, and try to respond in kind.  They mourn their dead when they find them, and form up hunting parties when they do, which is alarming and noisy when the corpse is anywhere near your camp (though you can carry bodies elsewhere to throw them off your scent!).  

The enemies on the island patrol dynamically, and remember where they've encountered you or seen your structures, and adjust accordingly.  Standing your ground and killing patrols make them less likely to attack you when they don't massively outnumber you (e.g. lone scouts), but more likely to patrol or outright attack where they think you are in and in bigger numbers.  If you like to fight, the NPCs will oblige by getting more fighty.  Playing it stealthy and refraining from murder, you'll still get into the occasional fight (or flight) but there will be fewer NPCs out looking for you (and less likely to follow you if you try to give them the slip).

The Forest is not for everybody - but it's a good fun-sized survival game.  Finishing it is far from a daunting prospect - most of the challenge in finishing it comes from figuring out where you can and can't go - finding the caves, and delving into them.  Then maybe revisiting old caves when you get new tools (e.g. SCUBA gear).  If you know where everything is and just go straight to it and live off knowing where all the candy bars and soda are stashed, you will skip a ton of exploration time and the game could be finished in a day probably.  But if you just play it and don't know all that, it'll take a while to finish - pretty much down to how much you dawdle."

Me, a few friends and my sister all played this game together and its super fun to build log castles and wood skyscrapers. Also the map is huge so exploring the landscape is always fun! with a bunch of cave systems to explore in. And the dangers are great, you must make weaponry to fight back the cannibals and monsters that live on the island you crash landed on. 

Could not recommend this game more! Buy it now!"

15584,"Take you son and travel far away ..ah damn your plane falls down nobody survives just you and just see how your son get kidnapped..
Thats the story , sure you find your son .But the first try to survive ,hunt and built a base , construct weapons or find any stuff in caves or diverse villages at the island.
You can run around 100 of days and more and dont finish the story or you know the game and you are finish in 3days .
Its about you ,if you want just do the story or you like the survival basemode. Defend against several attacks and creepy enemies or just speedrun the game..
With friends its easier alone you can get a bit paranoid dont worry its ok but a little hint,when you die..
Never die under the water or in the snowhils (and put the spawn there) because in the water you never can catch it again alone or in the snow mountain you will need a special coat for survive .

The game have a lot different plants and animals , enemies can be different ,the sleep automatical respawn of the ""villages"" is a good help for ropes or soft drinks /arrows/chocolate food or dynamite ...etc."

15594,"This game saved my life.

I am 28.

My ex-wife and I have a daughter together, and adopted our son together. They are now both 4 years old.

When we were going through our separation, I found myself lost and miserable. I was self destructive. I got so mad one day from everything spiraling out of my control that I punched some concrete in a moment of overwhelming emotion. That caused me to break my 5th metacarpal in my right hand... my working hand... my games hand.. the hand that I held and carried my children to bed with.. The hand I desperately needed to make sure I could continue to provide.

After learning of the severity of my self-inflicted damage, I was borderline suicidal. Keep in mind that just a few months before this, I was the happiest man with no history of depression or anxiety. I have never had fits of rage, or been one to break down and cry, but I was in a low spot that just really buried me from being able to see the light on the other side.

Having nothing better to do, I searched for a game I could play, ONE HANDED while I recovered. I somehow stumbled upon this game and read some of the reviews. I decided that it had to be worth a shot... I must admit, I didn't beat the game, or play nearly as long as some of you. In fact, I may have only played this game a day or two.. With that being said, after doing so, I had a new found joy and hope for life. I was able to put behind me the pain and suffering that had been cast over me. I was able to experience other peoples joy and happiness. I was able to see the fruits of my ""labor"". I relaxed for 5 :hillary: :hillary: :hillary: :hillary: :hillary: :hillary: :hillary: minutes to this music long enough to realize that I was going to be okay.
After coming to that realization, I turned the game off, and I went back to work. It hurt my hand like hell but I was motivated. I stopped feeling so damn sorry for myself, and I became the father I needed to be in that moment, not the weak boy I was behaving as.

Today, I am close friend with my kids mother. We don't fight, or argue, or say hurtful things to each other. We are parents, and friends.

I now have 3 kids. My third child is, wait for it, ALSO 4 YEARS OLD. The woman I am with was going through a very similar situation at the time of my own separation, and we just stumbled in to each others life unexpectedly. We have been in a relationship for a year now, and are very happy together.

Moral of the story, you never know what life holds in store for you, and if I would have given up when all the odds were stacked against me, I wouldn't be where I am today. This silly little game helped me realize that.

Thank you"

"
15618,"on paper the game is really fun
mechanics are typical of a survivalcraft game but the caveat is that exploring the caves is truly terrifying even with another person
the drawback of this game is that the hostile enemies are literally programmed so that you cannot avoid them after a certain point in the game and you are plagued with constant raids which are virtually undefendable
would be a fantastic game if you could avoid the cannibals but that one game decision from the devs singlehandedly ruined the game experience"

15623,Really enjoy this game and playing with friends; love the story part of the game even though the ending is REALLY MESSED UP. Mostly we just try to survive. It gets annoying when you play on a server and as long as the 'host' is on; time is passing even if the other players aren't on. As the game time goes on more and more 'baddies' come making it nearly impossible to build anything unless you just start over in another part of the map.

15671,"This game was incredible.. but some things really got to me.
Disclaimer: minor gameplay spoilers, nothing from story

In short: After completeing my home, and completeing the story. I feel fulfilled yet wanting more. This game rewards you immensely for going off the beaten track, if you can see one that is haha. I hear this game is great with friends but I played solo. Lumberjack simulator with fair amounts of hints of danger. Don't forget to save at a bed or shelter you've made frequently. Always prepare for the worst, no such thing as being too prepared in this wilderness.

In full:
When I first woke up from the beginning of the story.. you were literally thrown into this beautiful wilderness we know as 'The Forest', and my Subnautica mind kicked in almost immediately: Make a shelter, do I need tools?, get some food somehow, hows my water, can I do this before night? Alot of things flooded into the cranium and I was hooked into this game immediately. As night came, they arrived.. I wasn't ready for them and ended up running along a coast line until I dipped into a big pond and lost them as I stayed under the water as long as my breathe would allow. Day came and I made some progress on something resembling a place I can at least hide for the night. I learned you can sleep in this game but it goes off of when you did it last over if it's night or day. Fast forward to having this small cabin made with a defensive wall around it, bordering a deep pond so my foes can't get in my base but I have access to water I can boil, my ambitions get bigger... fast forward till about 3 or 4 days of gameplay from the times of this review, I finished my log cabin, log for log, rock for rock, it's a masterpiece imo that took alot of finesse with the building mechanics of this game (it has a very elaborate custom log building system, probably the best building system in any game I've ever played! Impressive 11/10). I knew it was time to proceed with the story... 

I should add in between all of those happenings I mentioned above, I cave dived to explore and got quite rewarded for my efforts.. I'll let you figure out the rest but in conclusion with this remark: Save at a bed or tent/shelter before you go down. Be sure spare underwear is available irl lol."

15720,"I completed The Forest a while back and I held off writing a review because at the time I had real mixed feelings about ""the end"" (no real spoilers, I promise!)

The Forest is a game of 3 main parts: the surface, simple caves and the [spoiler]sinkhole[/spoiler]. The first few hundred hours I poured into this game was on the surface and the simple caves. Exploration was fun with a sensible level of survival and progression ... and that's where this game shines: base building.

Bases start as simple, well hidden, with small fires and basic comforts. You can spend ages finding nice little spots, just far enough from regular patrols, but near enough to essential resources, building essential outposts you'll need for exploring further and deeper. Now, you could complete The Forest with just these simple bases, but actually, this is where the game really shines! Once you know your way around the island you'll find yourself drawn to spots where you think ""hey, this would be a really nice spot to put down some roots - look at that view!"".  Soon, your simple camp grows and the base building mechanics of the game really kick in. You'll soon have walls, rooms, heat and light! It's here where The Forest lets loose in a way that few other games do. It's not pefect, it has niggles, but base building is a real joy and the freedom a player has is only tempered by their ability to create whilst under attack by the islands denizens.

Multi-player takes base building to a whole new level and is where the game really shines and where I spent many happy hours, creating, tweaking, experimenting.

I'd played most of my hours in Alpha and took a break from the game until it was fully released. My return focused more on the story line rather then base building. I stuck to smaller, agile camps which provided sufficient shelter whilst not attracting too much attention. The game doesn't penalise you for this at all, in fact, staying on the move often proves less dangerous, albeit you need sharp eyes and ears with an ability to get stealty really quick.

Solo, and agile I started to really enjoy the flow of the game ... until I hit the end part of the game. From being very open, very player-led, the game takes a far more linear path. The closer to ""the end"" the more this was true. Rather than exploring and chosing how I was approaching not getting eaten I found myself on a narrow path with enemies I simply had to go through, rather than choose if i wanted to fight or stealthily avoid. And the nearer I got to the end the less fun I was having ......... and that's why I didn't review the game right away. Because, right then I felt all those hours had been spent in the wonderful sandbox to suddenly going through a narrow tunnel.

Now, don't get me wrong, the story is good, and there are important (albeit often vague and unexplained) player choices, but the end of the game felt very, very different. I couldn't just bail temporarily and enjoy the top side for a while longer, or pop back for supplies, I was on a path I couldn't control to a great degree.

Overall though the game is amazing! The graphics are beautiful, the setting and almost silence of The Forest are so appealing, as is the sudden pace change when you walk into a group of the islands inhabitants. The above-ground section of the game is amazing and my only real gripe there was the AI of the enemies which could have been so much better.

If you're looking for a survival game and not so concerned with the actual stroy line so much then you will love The Forest."

15795,"One of my favorite games. 

The graphics are more than good enough and make the open-world (island) very pleasant to explore. The world offers a lot of different landforms and terrain for the player to evaluate and decide on the kind of base they want to build. Minding my business chopping trees and spearing fish is an enjoyable and relaxing experience. At least until I hear the distant shrieking of cannibals and have to decide to flee or fight. Players have a variety of weapons they can make or find, as well as defensive items to be built, allowing us a lot of freedom in play style and strategy. 

There is a main plot that is almost entirely made up of environmental story-telling and exploration. Should the player choose to explore the caves below the island they will come across various items that offer insight into what the hell is going on as well as direct them towards the goal of finding the protagonists son. The plot is interesting enough, but it's not really where the game shines.

This isn't one of the scarier games I have played. Most of the fear is in the tension of knowing that the enemies are out there watching but having no idea where. The player needs to keep their eyes peeled for movement in the tree tops, ears attuned to notice the snap of a twig or rustling of leaves that could just be the wind or a rabbit but might be something waiting to attack. The scariest part about cannibals is their speed and ability to jump from tree to tree, hunting you from above. The island also contains mutants who are luckily slower and make a fair bit of noise. I love the mutant designs. Virginia is easily one of my favorite enemy designs in a game. 

A decent amount of space combined with the crafting system and fun combat mean that even after over one hundred hours my experience playing the game is still unique and enjoyable each time."
15796,This game is so difficult but it is so worth it. Survival and horror and custom building mixed perfectly together. I love horror and I let out a scream in my house by myself at one point. It is so amazing.

15897,"Review of VR version: So close to being amazing, but in the end, it's just another janky half-a**ed VR port of a flat game. Correction: I see it's actually a flat game with a VR ""mode"". Good lord, I should have known better. VR isn't just a gimmick anymore. Make a VR game or don't.

My biggest complaint is that the physical crouch option is broken. Every time I squat down or even bend over to try to reach something on the ground, suddenly I'm levitating three feet in the air, and whatever I was reaching for is now out of reach. And this bug apparently appeared in 2019. So I guess the game is abandoned or they just never cared that much about making it an actual VR game in the first place.

Possibly both, judging from the weird cuts to a third person view, which is unexpected and jarring in VR. And then I get to a part where I have to get through a whole cave system full of enemies with no saves or checkpoints, in a game where throwing molotovs is really weird and hard to aim and more likely to set me on fire, where there's one spot you have to walk through but there seems to be an invisible wall, where sometimes I get launched into the air for no reason...at which point I think I've decided I've had enough.

There are good native built-for-VR-from-the-ground-up games now and more on the way, including at least one survival game, and another that is technically a VR port, but I hear is so well done it might as well be a native VR game. VR games are not just flat games in 3D. I don't care how good the flat version of a game is; if they're not going to take the time and effort to actually make a good VR game out of it, I'd rather they just didn't even bother."
15898,VERY YES FOR YES

15993,gud game
15994,"This game is meant to be played together and that's very clear in the game's systems. I tested it out with a friend for about 2h and we had a blast but he refunded the game so I was left to play alone. Now, I'm not going to argue the game needs and ""easy mode"", it doesn't but the scaling of difficulty between playing solo and coop is like night and day. When playing coop you can easily deal with 6 normal enemies rushing at you but for some reason I don't think the game does any scaling of this when playing solo. I get absolutely destroyed if 3 of em rush at me at once, 4 hits and I'm dead. All the other mechanics like building, crafting and such are great but the game feels like a pain to play when you're alone because it's not balanced. Normal difficulty (easiest in the game if you exclude peaceful) shouldn't be to much of a struggle to get through, you should get close to dying and face a challenge but it should be able to be overcome by trying a few times. So in summary, if you want to play it together with friends definitely buy this game, otherwise I can only recommend it if you like grinding and dying a good few times before you survive  your first nights."

16017,"The best spooky game. I really love this game. It's excellent at being a horror game, it's a survival simulator too, you can build as much as you want (or not), and all the little details, such as game mechanics, crafting, and the makeup/design of the [i] literal forest [/i] are really what truly makes this one of the greatest games of all time. 

Sometimes I just like to stand in the forests during the daytime. When the wind is blowing, and the sounds of the trees and the animals are all around you, it's just beyond magical. It could nearly rival the real thing. Ethereal."

16032,"This game and Green Hell are the holy grail of survival games. I recommend playing singeplayer at first to get the horror and loneliness feel of the game. Once that wears off, I recommend playing with a friend or two. By far, my favorite qualities are the tree chopping mechanic, the graphics, and the cannibals with their AI. My least favorite qualities are that building is long and tedious and can be destroyed quickly by cannibals and instantly by mutants, and the zipline will not work in certain angles- and if you want to rebuild it, you have to destroy it and rebuild it with new resources, including the valuable resource ,rope. Overall, it it is my favorite survival game alongside Green Hell and I 100% recommend."

And a blast played with mates. I reckon it's also peaceful and relaxing when the cannibalistic mutants aren't eating you. You tend to loose your sense of time playing this game which makes it a really good game along with a amazing story. 
I'm so hyped for it's upcoming sequel!!!

16096,"Great game; very fun to play as a group with friends. There is some plot to the game but it's very subtle? Finding plot points is essential to BEATING the game but not necessary to survive in the game. Private servers/worlds are easy to manage, and there are options included to personalize your game with relative ease (resources being replenished, enemy difficulty, etc). 
It also seems that there is a creative mode, which I have not tried but seems very interesting as well. 

Overall I would give the game a 7/10 for intuitive gameplay, replayability, and just general fun."
16097,sheesh
16098,"The best part about the game is being absolutely scared in the dark and imagining voices around you when you're just cutting down a tree. Playing it with friends is much better because then you can scream into the mic asking for their help while running towards your base and being chased by 6 cannibals. The chaos that comes when 3 mutants raid your base is also the most fun part

8/10 would recommend
10/10 would recommend if have friends"

16130,Amazing game and story line. The graphics and sound effects make it seem almost real. Terrifying monsters and challenging natives make the game all the better. Definitely recommend 100%. However if you don't have a good graphics card the game lags constantly. Definitely better on a homemade PC than a laptop. You need great graphics to beat the final boss otherwise your computer crashes. But I still love it and fully recommend! Every rival is beautifully terrifying and I love it

16155,"Always come back once in a while to this game. However I feel like the learning curve is very steep, and at least a few replays later you can sort of get a hang of this game. This leads to my bad review for this game because, since replays are quite frequent in this game, the map and locations of items are exactly the same, making it growingly repititve after each game.

For instance, in other to get to the ending, you do step 1,2,3,4,5
but because the enemies get exponentially strong with time, you see yourself dying before step 4, then you have to repeat the previous steps numerous times.... fun for a few playthrough, but gets boring after that, no matter if you get to the end or not, very bad replayibility"

16174,"As far as my impressions of The Forest, I have to confess that, unlike other survival games I have played, I do not find myself sitting alone thinking, ""I really want to play The Forest for a while."" On the contrary, I get a 'butterfly stomach' when I think about playing alone.  Rather then being drawn to the game and then scared while playing, I find myself scared of playing and yet drawn to it (to some degree) because of that apprehension. That said, I am enjoying The Forest, but like most games I play, I enjoy it more with others rather than solo."

Some of the monsters could be designed better though"

On the positive side, some of these bugs are even fun. [b]Nevertheless, I recommend this game.[/b]"

16197,"i've beat this game far too many times, made so many friends while playing and i must say this has to got to be one of the best and scariest gaming experiences i ever had. the randomization of the game is great, as you either spawn in and see literally 0 cannibals or the whole village rolls up on you. it may also make your life of finding food and water easy or extremely difficult because the damn deer have weird hitboxes and run annoyingly fast. the darkness in this game is incredible, as it is genuinely impossible to see if you don't have any light sources. the caves are genuinely horrifying, as they are extremely dark and the cannibals scream at you from the darkness. the way you and your friends begin screaming when an armsy charges you in a cave or a group of cannibals rushes at you is something you never experience in other games. while the game can be non-serious at times, i believe it is a great horror experience and everyone should give it a shot."

I also do wish there was more content to explore, I kinda felt I had seen it all already with mainly just the same monsters just in different colour reskins and all the caves kinda looked the same.
There wasn't a lot of different kind of animals either and exploring in the cold temperature areas wasn't really necessary for anything, just felt kinda gimmicky.

TLDR; Game is fun but barebones, needs more content

I will play the sequel and hope to see more content and more diverse enemies :)"

16360,Nate Higgers.
16361,good to play and enjoy
16362,One of the better games i played in a long time. i 100% recommend trying this game out if you haven't played it before but see if you can get a group of friends together to play to make it more fun.
16363,chop a tree down
16364,It is fun and annoying at the same time.  You can do cool things.

16373,very nice shit
16374,I had a pretty good experience playing the forest nothing bad so say about this game the only thing that I would say is that you need to play this with your friends playing solo is not that fun unless you're grinding for achievements but that's just my take on it

16381,"this game is tough. if you like Minecraft, Valheim, and Raft and other sandboxy, open world, survival-craft games, this is a new challenge. The only thing i'd say negative is that this game doesnt do a very good job of guiding you through. I accidentally stumbled upon the end of the game without having done A LOT of the things you're 'supposed' to do/get. But it's a challenge and if you like these types of games? You'll enjoy this new challenge."

16389,fun with friends scary alone
16390,Nice
16391,Cool game
16392,"This is a fun game, and there's plenty to do, but honestly it's underdeveloped. There are a large number of bugs that were never fixed, and it sends the fans in my brand new, high spec gaming PC crazy. I've still played 52 hours, and I'm not finished yet (having too much fun) but I wish this game had been given a bit more love. Hopefully the sequel (Sons of the Forest, due October 2022) will be a lot more polished."
16393,jhon is hot.
16394,gg good game
16395,best survival game so far!!!
16396,"This game is a masterpiece. From the lack of music to fill the voids, to the desperation of the music in the main menu screen. The visuals are great and amazing for when the game was released. The cannibals chasing you around the peninsula feel almost human as they take attacks in turns and roll to dodge attacks. The building aspect adds a lot to the game's ambiance, as even the smallest amount of protection from the unknown and feared can add a sense of security and some horror at the same time. All in all, The Forest is one of the best video games I have ever played. I'm personally very excited about Sons of the Forest."
16397,"Excellent game, different experience in VR!
If you like Exploring and crafting to survive in a creepy environment this game is for you"
16398,its trash
16399,Playing the campaign in co-op was one of the best gaming experiences ever.

16407,goog
16408,swinging little hot dog helicopter monster
16409,best thing about this game is the walkie talkie
16410,"Finally just beat the game after an eternity of goofing around and making new worlds but totally worth it. It can be buggy at times but if your'e looking for a survival horror, then its one of the best games you could go for. Only complaint I have is the permanent hearing damage I have from my friend screaming at the bats in caves."
16411,one of the best games i have ever played the story line is amazing and the whole aspect of the game is cool 10/10 if you don't mind a bit of jump scares then you should buy this game
16412,"Better with friends, highly suggest friends"
16413,I love being kidnapped by cannibals while I‚Äôm building a cabbin that‚Äôs inside of a cave that was just claimed from other cannibals(they died suddenly by my axe)

16420,"This game is OUTSTANDING. It is pretty scary but once you build a base and get some good light, you'll be fine. This in VR is AWESOME on the Valve Index with full finger tracking and Half-Life: Alyx kind of vibes. I highly recommend that you get this game! You won't regret it :D 
Have a fantastic day!"

16458,"EN; --- a good survivor! any friends? play with them will be fun! no friends? don't worry, 3 nights and a whole crowd of friends ""foes"" will come running to you who will definitely appreciate your buildings in this game and no matter how long you built them, they are not satisfied with your every action, probably they just protect nature from deforestation. But, if you still decide that these friends are not suitable for you, you, as a civilized person, can roast them at the stake, for that they will obviously be more useful. First of all: you did well, as you gave a ""warm"" welcome to your friends. Secondly: friends will stay with you, because you will walk in armor made of their bones. Thirdly: delicious.

16476,cool game for survival with out a dinasaur in site
16477,"I have known and played The Forest for quite some time and everytime I go back to the game I't brigs me not only enjoyment but terrifying excitement. 
I love when you can get jumpscared out of nowhere one time and build your house peacefully the next. I like all the cannibals and mutants, but what I really like is that you can take animal and enemy heads and put them on walls like trophies. 

It's a great game and if you have not played it I suggest you try it out especially if you love survival! :D"
16478,gud
16479,"Amazing game, I bonded with many friends when we killed some naked cannibals trying to eat our guts.
I remember, selling my soul for a stick in this game and to this day, i don't know what the devil is doing with my soul. A group of my pals (me included ofcourse) decided to Deforest the entire forest to make way for our lord and savior Jesus Christ. But this crusade came to a stop, after one of our rafts decided to fly and become a treehouse.

During this time, i have completely forgotten about my son Timmy who has been lost since we crashed. I am faithful to Timmy's mother, but the naked female cannibals running around my camp are starting to make me question that loyalty. If you think that it would be easy to keep said loyalty, you have not been on this island for 7 years with nothing resembling pleasure except for this dirty tree stump, which has just started to grow things and i believe that Timmy is now officially a big brother, so if i find him, i will tell him this wonderful news. 

May whoever find this message come to this island, to save me from these females and this tree stump who is soon going to ask me to pay child support..."

16512,"This game is a blast. I don't know what it is about it, but it's just so fun (both with friends and without, though I highly recommend playing with friends for a full hilarious experience).

The building mechanics are a bit janky sometimes, but there's just something satisfying about spending hours chopping down trees to make nice log cabins and fences that will inevitably get torn down by mutated beings from hell. In fact, most of my hours are probably just from chopping down trees and struggling to find sticks.

The combat is very simple, but you can upgrade your weapons to an extent which is nice. The spears take some used to aiming with if you want to throw them. The bows are a little easier to get used to.

It doesn't matter how long you've played or what you do, there's always a dread-filled, creeping feeling when you hear the cannibals' screams at night when all you have for comfort is the torchlight. The worst are the caves, which are deep, dark, and terrifying. They did an amazing job with the tension and creepiness factor. I still haven't gotten the courage to go into a cave alone.

I'm very excited for the new Forest game in the works."

16528,Kak fun
16529,"This game is incredibly fun. I originally played it at a friends house and had to buy it for myself because I had spent about 70 hours in game over there and they were getting annoyed with me. The game has a compelling story and can be very scary when you're on your own. When played with friends however, it can become an insane free-for-all with the cannibals vs. the unstoppable force that is YOU. I 100% recommend playing this game."

16567,"Probably the best survival/horror game I've played so far. Even if you're not into the whole horror theme of it, you can play with no natives, so on a way, this game is nearly for everyone, and it gives you enough space to do whatever you want. Amazing survival mechanics, interesting story, scary ass enemies, and so many fun ways to fight them back, and to build shelters, you know, to survive.

For such a small team, this game is way better than I expected to be, 10/10."

16583,"So far it has been an incredible experience!! Building, surviving, and fighting mutant cannibals!! I play on VR and PC and it has been great! Takes some time figuring it out, but you can always look up beginners tips on the tube of you. I love the caves! Just be aware of the crying... I won't spoil it...
Only con I have so far is on VR you have to pull up your inventory and grab your walkie talkie to be able to talk to others in online mode even when they are standing in front of you, (Unless there is something I am doing wrong). It becomes burdensome especially in the caves or at night when trying to be able to see and communicate. Every time you pull your inventory your light goes out on your torch. You can only light it if you build a campfire unless you don't use the walkie talkie."

16614,"Gameplay is good. Survival aspects are well thought out. Base building is fun. Exploring is good and sometimes fun. Enemy AI is interesting. Almost everything in this game is extremely well done.

The only thing I can think of that I dislike is how not scary the game gets after you learn to aim the bow. A single headshot takes all smaller enemies down. Makes for trivial fights. I kinda wish on higher difficulties some enemies had shields or something that they use to protect their heads from arrows. Would make things more interesting.

All around great game, though!"

16635,"Hello there, reader of my stupid brief reviews I wrote in a coffee buzz for fun.
The Forest was a unique experience. I played it twice with friends, first time with a friend who was cooperative... the second time was as cooperative as a my parents trying to deal with my childhood trauma. 
A lot of memes, screams and creams in some pants were had. 
7,5/10
Hemulimymmeli will come for you...."
16636,"The first 10 hours , ""I can't get enough of this game, this is so addicting."" 

The next 10 hours , ""This is getting too repetitive and I already explored the whole island."""
16637,good game
16638,This is a very well done survival horror crafting game. The art and sound design is spectacular and really scared me at times (especially inside caves or at night). The combat is decent but you should definitely try your best to fight from range as the enemies can mess you up easily if given the chance. The building portion of the game is pretty fun but the amount of wood / stone necessary can be a bit too much for some structures (such as the gazebo) which makes it a bit tedious. There are some minor bugs but nothing too game breaking. Overall I highly recommend this game and am looking forward to the sequel.
16639,"My very first survival game when stepping on Steam. I have played it several times, and I could say it's quicker, easier, and stronger with more people around. Collecting materials and building will surely take less time when you do it together. When I played it duo, it feels more challenging that I can explore, craft and learn everything from scratch. By the time I play it again, it's for accompanying friends who haven't completed the main story. Overall, The Forest offers a generous amount of adventure and thrill when played with friends, but a bit gore for me."

Additional notes: I say game time is infinity and beyond because it depends what you're trying to accomplish, if you want to find timmy (or whatever his name is I don't remember) then yes it will take a while but if you're just exploring the island and trying to survive against cannibals then yeah it's a never ending game. Pretty decent game.

16645,fun with friends but building is kinda limited
16646,I've never been so stressed about trying to collect rocks and wood to build a fence. 10/10 AI is scary and the paranoia is real.
16647,good game lots of fun with many friends
16648,"one of the best survival experiences around. you can just piss around in the forest doin' your regular harvest/build/fight cannibals game loop, or go explore the cave systems for story and special items. even better in vr, which isn't perfect, but works surprisingly well, and doesn't even give me motion sickness after a few hours. it's good by itself, but multiplayer i think is where it shines, IF you have a dece group of people i guess."

16678,"I just finished the game with my girlfriend doing coop from the very start to finish. I highly recommend this for survival fans.
The base building mechanic is great and your defenses keep you mostly safe as long as you keep up with the maintenance. The game has a grind to it but no where near as much as a game like Ark. The Traps you build to stop the cannibals are hilarious for such a seriously toned survival game. 
Diving in the caves always feels intense and you don't get a full feel for their complexity to until you reveal most of the map for them. 
The tools you earn along the way keep the pace moving forward and let you go from barley surviving to thriving.
The ending was also A+,  I can't wait for the sequel."

My one complaint is that the game price should be reduced, I bought it on sale it was well worth 7 dollars but I think the base price should be dropped to 15 the 20 dollars seems a little much for a game that has been out since 2014 even if I think its worth 20 dollars people that haven't played it would shy away from the 20 dollar price tag."

16765,"this review consists spoilers
 You're stranded on a land with cannibals who have a machine to break down any kind of plane from the sky and make it crash land.
 As I see it, the concept is pretty good and it brings a fun experience while exploring caves, I, who played with friends of course enjoyed it a lot, but it still felt mysterious whilst I was with them.
 Furthermore, I can see why people enjoy this game since it has a somewhat of good replay-ability.
 In conclusion: the game is enjoyable 8/10."

Is a awesome game, about to survival how many days you can or to search for the kid to rescue, but not to late is cuz you're gonna do the bad ending, the graphics are fantastic and good optimized at perfomance, so you don't need to worry about of your old pc.
   Is more fun if you play co-op with your friend/friends, it's not a game where you get angry and the cool part is when you travel through the caves, foods/resources/etc. are regenerates back, so, you can do farm from this.
   In conclusion, is chil game, is not a harder game, avoiding some big creatures/boss, and if you worry about are so many items to craft, don't panic,you will learn faster becz yeah, is easy."

16808,"the first day goes by fine, you say to yourself ""this game isn't that scary,"" then night comes. it's pitch black, you can only see about three feet in front of you using your lighter, ""did i see something in the top of that tree,"" you ask yourself. ""was that laughing,"" you say turning around. ""did i hear breathing"" you say looking around you, squinting. then you see him, about 50 feet from you stands a seven foot tall humanoid creature, hunched over, breathing heavily. he charges at you and you defeat him, but the noises continue, ""i have a bad feeling about this,"" you say to yourself before three of them surround you.

16810,I think this game is fun. it has a lot of bugs but thats just how games are. The one thing they should change is womens nudity. They need to get rid of that because kid eyes are seeing this.
16811,"Difficult, demanding, frustrating, terrifying, beautiful and captivating. A truly perfect game for those who don't mind a little blood and mental anguish. It can be glitchy at times, but is an overall great experience. I would give it a solid 9/10."

16847,"This game put me into a downward spiral of cannibalistic crimes, my friends and I so enjoyed butchering the native peoples of the island but that ""innocent dark fun"" turned into a craving for human flesh. Several weeks after I consumed my first victim, I have now consumed over 13 people. I have received a life sentence of imprisonment and I may never taste freedom again, I am writing this on the computer in the prisons library. Don't let this game twist you, no matter how good it tastes. 8.5/10, more fun with friends."

English/Angol: The game itself is very enjoyable if you have someone to play with. The story was quite well hit and so were the side quests. I'm glad the game makers put a lot of hidden things into the game. The problem with this is that it alone is boring, the ideal player amount is 4-8 people. Good luck to all of you playing"

16904,i finnaly got everything completed this game is a 10/10!
16905,da
16906,One of the best survival games. I dont really care for the story in this game tho. Building a base and defending from cannibals did it for me.
16907,"Spent two hours carefully collecting resources, preparing an area and exploring our local surrounding whilst trying to figure out what was happening.

Night falls, and we have finally a home, a small crop plot, meat, defenses

Friend chops down a tree to complete an 'idea' he's had. Smashes house to kindling.
Cannibals attack, I am eaten, friend is somehow on fire and a lifelong friendship is ruined.

10/10 will play again"
16908,is good
16909,There's still a staggering amount of bugs for a fully released game. There's better options for survival games.
16910,"Pill popping, baby killing ,candy bar munching adventure/thriller - only in the end do you get coffee and rock music on a cassette!"
16911,"Whilst my friends and I have yet to finish the game, that does not take away from the fact that The Forest is a great co-operative survival experience. Being chased by cannibals at every moment is definitely not calming, and shows the kind of atmosphere that you‚Äôd be getting yourself into. The base building mechanics are very easy to use and allow you to really personalise your camp. Whether you‚Äôre playing on the hardest difficulty or the easiest, the game‚Äôs story is compelling and creepy - Two qualities I think a horror game should have. Therefore, I would recommend the game to those who are looking for a creepy cannibalistic experience."
16912,VERY FUN
16913,Can't get enough of it!
16914,A very fun and sometimes scary game that is cool to play with friends

16926,"Great game, its a helluva lot funner with friends, 10/10 would recommend. I always wanted a multiplayer horror game and this game does exactly that its perfect. couldnt ask for one better."
16927,I would recommend this game to other players of steam!!
16928,i got it.
16929,good fun
16930,Better than Minecraft
16931,fun
16932,"I replayed this game after my brother had introduced my to it to play with our friends and family. I cannot tell you how good this game is, and how nice it developed. I was completely obsessed with it until I beat it, and still play it afterwards. I can't wait for the release of the second one!"
16933,This is one of the best games to play with friends.

16943,finally I can live out my cannibal dreams <3
16944,You can kill homeless people
16945,"I have played this game for a while, I would easily say it is one of my favorite games. No matter how many times I enter the caves, it never fails to creep me out in one way or another. Weirdly enough, massacring and slicing up cannibals is very therapeutic."
16946,best survival game of all time.
16947,"big good when playing with friends 
"
16948,"Fun survival game. Played with friends and it 200% made it better. 

This game does have one major downside though, and that is that it feels unfinished. It really feels like an early access game and since it's finished it really shouldn't. Some of the menu's need some work, and I find myself going to the wiki to look up crafting recipes quite frequently. I also think that there should be more advanced tools for mass collecting of resources. If I need to make a wall that needs several hundred rocks which in my opinion is not unreasonable then there should be something that allows me to get those faster than just picking them up one by one. 

I hear they are making a sequel, and while I am looking forward to it I do hope they actually finish it and give it some good polish this time."
16949,forest
16950,fun iin coop
16951,fun game for you and friends or by yourself. only problem i saw was we beat the game before even exploring the map because the ending cave is at the coast and you dont need the climbing pick as you can just jump for it so we didnt even see half the map.
16952,"i taped a bottle of alcohol to a stick and proceeded to accidently throw it directly at the floor beneath me to catch a lizard, turns out it explodes and now the cannibals have a toasty corpse to eat"

16964,good game
16965,epic game
16966,"This game. This one right here. This is the GOLDEN STANDARD for survival games in my opinion. Every other survival game I've ever played has always at some point made me think ""man, I wish this game had this one cool feature like in the forest."" It is fucking INSANE how much you can build in this game despite there being a lack of large servers of people. It almost feels like Rust if the game wasn't nearly as brutal and the player base had very little toxicity. On top of the in depth building mechanics, the story for the game is truly riveting. I could replay this game several times and I would still enjoy the story and the gameplay as a whole. Survival game makers should take note, this one fucking NAILED it. 10/10, would DEFINITELY play again."
16967,"game is kinda good i love the naked cannibals, like much those boobs cannibals, they give boner to be, satisfation. i am looking forward to sons of the forest boobs."

16972,l
16973,"Definitely a fun game, especially with friends. I like the build aspect, and the fabrication system"
16974,"10/10 would recommend, more fun if in multiplayer mode, as the hoards can overpower you fast. Only recommendation is the hunger and thirst stats are too quick, need to be more slow and would love to see more smaller crafting options like weapons, crafting benches, etc. Overall super beautiful, amazing sound quality, and can't wait to see how far this goes :)"

17000,"10 hours in at the time of this review, over half of that in VR mode via Oculus Quest 2. Nearly shidded my pants on several occasions, since i also have a solo save. Very fun, keeps you on your toes, and very good at atmospheric horror."
17001,yes
17002,"This is one of my favorite games up with Garry's Mod I highly recommend this for horror fans.  I like almost every thing about this game, the weapons, game play, enemies, and the atmosphere. My only complaints would be those pain in the ass worms (and boss when near my buildings) breaking my buildings. I rarely fight these things, instead I just reload an old save ( especially the worms).  I also don't see why they censored the cannibals genitals when, A: this game is not for children, B: the female cannibals breast are not censored. I also find it strange how none of the dear are bucks. But I am nit-picking I was so excited to play this game once I saw the trailer and it did more than deliver. If this review seemed like I was just shitting on this game, it just because I thought this review would become a novel if I listed all the positives."
17003,good
17004,"fortnite is better

17042,Awemase
17043,"A fantastic survival game, though quite blurry in VR. It is not the most stable game ever, but it is well worth playing despite any issues you may come across. There is something special about building up a base and then defending it from terrible mutants."

17082,"This game is really fun to play with friends. I always get scared when ""they"" scream out of nowhere, which makes it very fun to play. I would definitely recommend playing this, because you can choose if you want to complete the story behind everything or if you want to build and just survive for as long as possible."

"
17201,"The Forest in a nutshell:
You've awaken.
Your son is gone.
You encounter little annyoing sh*ts that make saving your son harder.
You build a base that story-based gives u nothing because you'll abandon it after finding your son anyway.
You waste your time doing memes, achievements and burning bodies.
Finally, you come to research center, kill a mutated spider that looks pretty [strike] hot [/strike]I mean dangerous and illegal cause she's a minor even tho she's a monster.
[spoiler]You find your son, life is good, wife dead, but your son turns out to be another mutated thingy  [/spoiler]
Growing up in this family is really difficult I suppose. This is what they call a difficult childhood."

I never thought that a guy off the perc and about 30 pounds of acid could create such a mind boggeling game. This game is 100% worth the price. If you have not yet, visit youtube and watch some trailers on Sons of the Forest, the game that extends the storyline of the The Forest. Amazing game 10/10 would recommend."

Big Boobaroobas"
17297,the hardest ive ever laughed was the opening scene that goofy ahh kid
17298,"Alone, a harder, scarier game about survival, but with more people, it's a really fun game about surviving, cave diving, fort building and taking out enemies. with more than one person is where this game really shines, a great game that I played with my dad and am planning to play again with him and my brother and friends, overall, a great game to play with the boys at the end of the day/week"

I wouldn't play this 100% single player, but you may enjoy it. 
Very glitchy, some game breaking bugs unfortunately.
There is a focus on building in the game but I have found it to be secondary to the story-line progression - so if you just want to build a base you may be slightly disappointed. 
Great story line.
End Boss-fight is scaled up insanely from the difficulty of the rest of the game.

Will definitely be buying Sons of the Forest."
17305,YES

17307,"good game, just can get quite grindy if you are planning to build large structures, u keep collecting logs and stone 40% of the time, also adding automated mechanisms that are available mid-end game (like redstone in minecraft) would help, absolutely great story and final choice, cant wait for SOTF."

17316,"As someone who doesn't normally play these types of games, buy it. I love it. I do only play it with others as I find it easier and more manageable, but someone who is better at games in general might find it easier and more enjoyable to play in single player."

17376,PLAY THIS GAME! This game is such a fun adventure with some friends! The crafting can sometimes be confusing but is really unique. The Physics are the best things ever in this game! There is so many bugs with things like corpses and carts and I LOVE IT! You go flying or just get tossed across the map but all in good fun! Make sure you pack some friends along and you'll have a blast!!!

17378,"The Forest is a fun and interesting horror game, it had a lot to do and it was fun going around and exploring the map. Where this game really shine's is in multiplayer, you can troll someone and have them go down a rope to their death if you wanted to. Or you can have a tree house and huddle up there when you get attacked.

Over all if you're thinking about buying I would recommend playing with a friend."
17379,"Very good game, very fun to play with friends, but you also don`t have to. Whole community is pretty nice, so you can basically have so much fun even with random people."

17431,The crafting system is weirdly split so that it tells you what resources you need to build for structures and nothing about how to make food/medicine/pouches/weapons unless you have 1 of the required resources in your inventory. It It felt like this weird half way between the minecraft and subnautica crafting systems. I would have preferred if it was consistent.
17432,og good ol game
17433,its nice
17434,I screamed so hard that my dad woke up and beat me up to dead
17435,""" A fun experience solo, and a maddening yet eventful experience with friends and others.""

The Forest is yet another survival craft genre, though this time, its more crazy with brutality.  With the enemy AI, so much can be done.  Building is only one part of this game's interactive experience.  Highly recommend playing this game if you want: 1. Some crazy shit to just happen and spice up your sitdown life, 2. Building game with naked people 3. Horror experience that gets funnier as you play.

ps, lore is optional yet recommended"

"
17472,"The forest in ""The Forest"" often looks and feels as close to real as I've seen, and that's rad. The AI is extremely impressive, as I'm sure you've heard, but it is breakable. That's not a bad thing. Especially with how smart enemies feel and how helpless you are as an early-game solo player. That said, your experience with this game can go three ways: 

Play ""The Forest"" alone if you want a heavily immersive disaster survival crafting sim. 

Play ""The Forest"" with a friend if you want to somewhat break the immersion in favor of capital ""F"" Fun. 

Play ""The Forest"" with a friend using a third-party voice chat program if you want to get absolutely buckwild, build a treehouse or two, and cut a swath through the enemies you once feared. 

It's a good game, I'm a day one for the next installment."

I left my son in the facility,became a cannibal,ate the other cannibals, killed a child for the final boss,and created an entire family out of wood.
10/10 Would play again."
17477,Pretty fun game.
17478,"If the cannibals, monsters, and the island wont kill you, your friends will."
17479,"Note: I will edit this review once I complete the main story/quest to find ""Timmy."" At 23 hours at time of typing the following: 

This game is f-ting incredible. It is slightly janky at 8 years out from its initial release. This is very much an ""indie"" game. That said, the level of freedom in terms of what you can create, how much you can explore, and the level of depth in both literal, virtually physical/geological terms, as well as in terms of how deep the AI systems and mysterious story elements make the forested island seem, come together to create a survival-horrific co-op experience (lucky and cowardly enough to not have played alone yet) that is absolutely unparalleled and still graphically beautiful by current standards. You can slide downhill on a sea-turtle's shell and beat a cannibal to death with its own club after devouring its BFF's arms and legs, then turn the newly dead cannibal's skull and bones into arrows and light fixtures. You can build a raft next to the scene of this grizzly encounter and paddle it to a little island from which to view the larger island in all its terrifying grandiosity, toss some dynamite at a subtly marked bit of stone, and watch as the explosion uncovers a cache of hidden supplies. The achievements are goofy fun, too. Little Timmy be damned! I built a Gazebo!"

The ¬®Main¬® objective is to save Timmy. But to be fair no one likes Timmy. Timmy's ugly, Timmy smells weird, Timmy's a moron and no one likes him. I will still recommend to save him at least once, and then immediately leave him and build a FU*KING VILLAGE INSTEAD. But still a nice game surviving The Forest and or the caves. Can't say much about the soundtrack as most of it's just atmospheric sounds."
17516,"Can't boil water with the POT. It keeps duping the pot and I lose all my collected water. Not too happy because I can't find a fix. 
Edit: I fixed this bug by building a sap collector, so now I am happy. It is a very fun and immersive game, as well as pretty scary at times. I like the crafting. I have several hundred hours on a different platform, so this is not my first time playing the game."

17615,Not a bad game I really like it but after awhile you run out of stuff to build and all that's left is the story which is ok the first couple if time you play it after that it gets super repetitive and tedious
17616,"At first I thought this game was boring but after I tried it with my friend it completely changed my mind.
This game gives you a wonderful and unforgettable experience and makes you curious when you are exploring caves.
Really an unforgettable game.

17627,"Fun game to play with friends, can be creepy at some parts. There are some annoying parts of the game, like when it rains and you're away from base you have to build a fire and cant move away from it or you'll get too cold and freeze to death. Another annoying thing is that you can't bind mouse buttons, you can't have key binds for weapons (you have to go into your inventory and select the item each time) which is very annoying. If you can get over these inconveniences, it's a fun game."

I like a slower pace.  I tried the game again last month, but this time on peaceful mode. I found playing in this mode  extremely interesting and relaxing.   I'm close to 90 hours now and enjoying it more and more each day"

This game has all of that plus a really twisted story line (if you choose to follow it).  It is open world, so if you prefer you can just play around in the forest, build a nice little shelter or a massive monster harvesting machine, or become a forest pirate and just sail around the peninsula.  I prefer to play alone or on private servers with friends, public servers imo are annoying."

The controls are seemingly randomly placed around the Index controller functions in bizarre fashion.  You don't interact with things in a VR way.  It probably makes more sense if you've played it as a flat game first, and VR is just a novelty to you."
17747,Let me explain why I don't like this ridiculous game. Because this game makes my pc shut down instantly. It does what CS GO or others don't.

17765,"The Forest is a really intriguing concept and fun to play, except it is also buggy and has a lot of bad design decisions that kill the game's enjoyment off.

For example, rejoining a multiplayer game gives you two options: ""Continue"" and ""Join.""  If you absentmindedly click ""Join"" it erases your progress and starts you over.  Why is this even an option?

Also, time apparently does not stop on a dedicated server when all players are logged out - We had played for something like 12 hours, got a really decent base going, and then logged out.  Real life prevented us from getting together to play again for a couple weeks, and when we finally did, our base was completely gone and a dozen cannibals were standing around where it used to be - the only reason I know it didn't reset the map or anything was because the lumber sleds we built to haul logs around in that area were still there.  Apparently it also killed us off while we were logged out, because even clicking ""continue"" to get back on to the server started us over from the plane crash with empty inventories.

All in all, this could have been a great game.  But the developer stopped before it was done, and it's one of gaming's biggest dropped balls ever."
17766,"So i've played this game somewhat more on different accounts, and i have to say it is one of the most fun survival games because of how non-functional it is, this isn't any new groundbreaking information. Basically, what i'm trying to say is that so many aspects of this game are fucked beyond belief that it comes full circle and is more fun than if it were 100% patched. Games were the fun comes through bugs are notoriously frustrating in some parts, and this is no exception, the combat system needs a serious re-work and so does the AI of the enemies, however, if you can put aside all of that, you still have an incoherent mess of gameplay. 8/10

17769,"It was interesting at first until they started throwing boogey men at me and night fell really fast. So I spend long boring stretches sitting near a fire swinging at annoying boogeymen instead of playing the game. I wish they had sorted their pacing and made it so that I could actually play the game rather than spamming me with nightime sequences and boogeymen. Gave up after stumbling around in the dark one too many times. Note to designers: You don't have to spam the player with ""action"" in order to make the game interesting. There is enough to do and learn for you to leave them alone for a bit so they can just play and not be on a constant state of defense. Why can't I sleep through the night? Boring."

17802,"I thought this game was great! I played through the entire thing in VR which scared the crap out of me. Dropping into a cave full of monsters was certainly an experience that I would recommend everyone have in VR. Even beyond the scares, there is an element to the forest that keeps drawing you back in. Whether that be the crafting or the exploration, it creates an itch that must be scratched. I'm not going to give any spoilers but, I personally didn't enjoy the final moments of game play prior to the ending. It just felt like the juxtaposition between the 97% of the game play that came prior to it was too great. Overall it was a 9/10 VR experience."
17803,"best game!!! 2022
"
17804,"I like this game. It has an expansive map that is enjoyable to explore, you don‚Äôt feel bored as you walk through the forest and continue to look over your shoulder and behind trees‚Ä¶.waiting for any threats to present themselves. The sudden attack from those forest fellers are actually really realistic and align with my experiences. Funny little creatures they are. The building aspect is a lot more polished than one would expect. The player is able to cut down trees and construct buildings, defences, traps ‚Äì leading to a cohesive flow of the game. 

Just writing this is actually making me reflect on my own life and experiences a little bit. Some of the games accuracies have invoked some vivid memories within me. Usually I have a memory like a sieve, so games like this really help me to reflect (smiley face). 

I grew up in the lush forests of Ohio. Deep greens and beautiful browns as far as the eye can see. I lived with my father in a small clearing of the forest, close to a view of the ocean ‚Äì it was beautiful. I am a son of a preacher man, he would go to the local town and read the bible for those who came to listen. Delivering sermons, giving last rites, those sort of things. It was never really for me and I‚Äôm not sure if it was for him, but he liked carrying around the old bible and the attention it brought. He even would accept donations for his efforts, something I‚Äôd often tell him off for. But he‚Äôd just look at me and say ‚Äòson! If it smells, it sells!‚Äô I quite genuinely never understood what that could have meant, but I guess looking back that he meant that it didn‚Äôt matter that he wasn‚Äôt religious. Sure, the act of faking it was bad, but people enjoyed it anyway and got something from it ‚Äì so maybe he was right all along. One day when he was making his way down to the town, I called out to him from our humble home to remind him to take his Luncheon. That old coot would always forget his spam sandwich, more for me I guess. But I knew on that particular day that he‚Äôd be out late so I wanted to ensure he took the sandwich and his 2L bottle of full cream milk. My father was a simple man, and as I reflect on my life, I guess I am too.

Before we departed for the day we‚Äôd often shout out to each other: ‚ÄúLook out for the forest fellers!‚Äù as a laugh. We‚Äôd chuckle and go about our day, it was a fun little ritual that made us feel close. The forest fellers are the fabled creatures of the Ohio forests. No one has ever truly seen them and yet they are mentioned in the town almost daily over concerns about the threat they may pose. I never understood those town fools, I‚Äôd spent my whole life exploring those forests and had never seen such a creature. One day, once my father had left, I set out in the forest to hunt for dinner. It was a warm day, the sun trickled down through the lush trees above me and a distinct smell of pine hung in the air. It was still, quiet even, and the only sound heard was my boots against the slightly damp leaves which coated the ground below. It didn‚Äôt take long for me to find a rabbit stuck in one of my traps. Seeing the rabbits struggling in the bonds always made me feel strange. I was happy to know I‚Äôd caught dinner and would be able to cook us up a hot meal. However, I couldn‚Äôt help but feel sympathy to the creature. It‚Äôs death would allow me to eat and yet I could never shake the feeling that as I was staring at this struggling prey, I was looking at a reflection of myself. Almost as if in the middle of a food chain I couldn‚Äôt understand. I‚Äôd escape a glance at the eyes of the rabbit as it would peer at me. I could have sworn that those animals I hunted would gain some form of sentience before I would finish the kill. Their black eyes would peer at me, into the chasms of my emotions ‚Äì where conflict would stir. The way they stared at me always felt the same. A distinct feeling that their eyes were saying ‚Äúyou‚Äôre next‚Äù   
--------------------
That same night I had prepared the rabbit into a stew, and had it slowly reducing over a fire as my father arrived home. He was in a hurry and huffed into a chair by our dining table.

‚ÄúThose fools in the town, always playing silly buggers‚Äù. He muttered as he took a swig from his water flask. 

It was always the same. He‚Äôd sit down and complain about the town‚Äôs folk making fun of him, well, the non-religious ones ‚Äì ironic.

Father slumped further into his chair, his chin against his chest as he muttered. ‚ÄúA bunch of divs they are. Skinny, that bald fool, sat in his hightower all day thinking he‚Äôs above us all. Little does he know that his town folk wouldn‚Äôt be as content as they are without my sermons.‚Äù

‚ÄúSorry to hear they‚Äôre giving you grief again‚Äù

‚ÄúSorrys won‚Äôt cut the mustard, I need to show them how vital I am to that retched town‚Äù

‚ÄúFather, we‚Äôve never been of their kind. We‚Äôre proud forest people‚Äù

Father looked angry after I said that, but not at me. ‚ÄúOh, are we? That‚Äôs another issue, those idiots think we‚Äôre in cahoots with their big bad forest fellers‚Äù

‚ÄúWhat?‚Äù I stammered angrily

Father grunted out ‚Äúmmhmm‚Äù

I couldn‚Äôt believe it. Just because we prefer to live in the forest, they think we‚Äôre somehow friends with a bunch of mythical creatures? Those town folk can‚Äôt look past their own noses! 

I poured the stew out into two bowls messily, my coordination a little affected by my heightened mood. ‚ÄúLets not worry ourselves with them, we need to be above their foolishness‚Äù

‚Äúmmm‚Ä¶..maybe you‚Äôre right‚Äù father said as he swallowed a bite. ‚ÄúNot a bad stew, son‚Äù

-------------------

The next morning father went about his usual routine, grabbed his bible, and set out. ‚ÄúLook out for the forest fellers!‚Äù we cheered, as usual. I didn‚Äôt have much to do that day. I just tended to the gardens a bit, using some compost full of banana peels and other food scraps to keep the crops healthy. 

Once I washed up from the gardens I decided to venture into the forest for a walk. I was still fuming from the conversation the night before, and I was hoping I could clear my head from the walk. I‚Äôve heard the townsfolk have a remedy called Sudafed. However I had forgotten to ask father to collect some for me and thus the walk would have to do. I came upon a clearing not long into my walk.  A small area where the sun struck the ground and the trees had almost parted to allow it do so. It was a magical place, a natural marvel. I would come here often to relax. This time, however, the clearing felt different. It was like the ground had sucked up the sunlight and left me in a dark void. The trees around my almost felt to close me in. It was dark, solemn, and yet the light still poured in. I felt panic rise in my chest and my legs feel numb. A slight buzzing sound began to sound in my ears, soon growing louder and drowning out my own thoughts and even heartbeat. My head felt light, my body almost airy, and my mouth dry. I struggled to understand the feelings as I looked around hurriedly and attempted to grasp at the knife on my belt.

17805,this happened to me once
17806,this game is so good
17807,no
17808,no bc it keep crashing even tho i have good pc and its shit playing all alone no friends idk man seeya
17809,Super fun to play alone or with friends. Though much easier when you have people to help you survive!

17815,very good very niceeee
17816,"one of the best survival i ve ever played , even better if you play on multiplayer"
17817,Velmi dobr√° survival hra. P≈ô√≠bƒõh je cool ale kdy≈æ u≈æ dohrajete p≈ô√≠bƒõh tak je blb√© to ≈æe m√°te po≈ô√°d ten stejn√Ω svƒõt.
17818,"When I saw my favourite content creators, such as Captain Sauce and Smi77y amongst many others, play this game and have a blast with it I figured it had to have a lot of good things going on for it to garner that praise. As someone who thoroughly enjoys survival games, I was sold pretty much straight away with the setting and premise. So why am I not recommending this game to you? Because it's absolutely abysmal.

For starters, the combat is an absolute mess. I can barely, if at all, defend myself from the onslaughts of cannibals that can literally combo-stunlock me into death and lose my 30 minute save TWICE. I try everything the game tells me, and yet I get punished for following the guide. HELL, I get punished for NOT following the guide and crafting new gear and armour that does literally nothing to help me. I spent 20 minutes hitting trees to make a shelter or a sick house, which is fine since it's a forest and obviously you have to incorporate that somehow. But at the end of the day, I think the crafting system for structures is so unbearably tedious that making a simple FIRE is expensive.

Overall, this game is just a massive letdown from what I had my expectations set out to be. I was expecting to be met with a fun yet challenging experience, especially with the horror elements, but I was met with bullshit combat and survival mechanics that REALLY hindered my enjoyment for this game. Get it on a discount instead."
17819,great game but hard to fight unless your good at PvE. Also the girl cannibal is hot....

i hate my AUTISTIC friend."
17829,titties go hype
17830,i liked it beacause it was fun beating the game with my friends and megan is tough and strong as hell and i support it a thumbs up cause i liked it thanks for letting me play and everyone else.
17831,This game has helped me and my family stay sane during the COVID crisis.
17832,Its like the TV show lost only it actually has a non repetitive story that makes sense
17833,"Terrible, unsatisfying, ruined orgasm, swiss cheese, sunk cost fallacy, cuckold of an ending. The devs literally forgot they added an ending and you don't get the achievement for beating the game if you shut the lab down. SO MANY BUGS. First game ever where the host saving the world doesn't save the guests. Everything looks the same, the caves, the trees, the camps, the enemies, ALL THE SAME. TEDIOUS, REPETITIVE, BORING, BROKEN, GARBAGE. I spent hours building a base FOR NO REASON, you literally DO NOT need one. My inventory got wiped multiples times a game session because I wasn't the host. The AI is as smart as a sack of wet mice. The main antagonist was DOA. This game wants to be a survival, puzzle, horror, adventure, story driven narrative but doesn't do a single one of those right. I would have had more fun watching paint dry if I wasn't playing with 2 friends. I would rather have edged myself for 18 hours rather than playing this game."

17878,Stachu? Stachu... Gdzie pieniƒÖdze sƒÖ za las...
17879,"The one thing that is regrettable about this game is, I did not get it during it's release. It was on my wishlist literally for years.

This game is a blast with other people. If your group is well organized, some can hunt for food, while others are building.

The main story does not overwhelm the game making it priority. More like it is running in the background waiting for whenever you are ready. I find this good, as with story dominant games can feel like you are on a railroad track to completion.

Overall the graphics are great, but they are a few things I like to point out. The deer looks cartoonish, the player model is really atrocious. Which is weird because the cannibals  look fairly good in comparison. Lastly  since we on are the topic of cannibals. Why didn't they give the males naughty bits or a grass skirt like the females? Kinda immersion breaking seeing a bunch of ""Ken Dolls"".

Final tip before I bring this review to a close. Play your game on multi-player host. That way you can invite friends to participate in the world of your creation."

17969,pee pants
17970,is cool
17971,i had a whale of a time eating people and spear fishing
17972,"Good game with friends, sometimes glitchy and buggy but this gives a nice texture to this *chefs kiss*"
17973,Crashes alot. Spend a hour exploring a cave only to have the game crash at the end of it when I finally got to the top of a very very very long rope. When starting up the game again found out I lost all the progress we made and the plants in our farm were gone. Also teleportation deer that vanish after you shoot them once. So glad they are making a second game when the first one isn't even finished properly.

17975,"Fun little story, chilling (as a horror game should be) and frightening at times. Great to play with friends."
17976,its somewhat realistic and its a solid 10/10 for me

It was great back in 2018 for what it was, it's still ok now in 2022. 

But it being 'ok' and having overwhelmingly positive reviews is just bs, regardless of other people being entitled to an opinion. There are far, far better games on the market. This one just happens to be a streamer's fan-favorite so naturally a lot of blind followers will jump on the hype train that it's something spectacular. 

Is the horror unique and terrifying? Yeah it is
Are the graphics good? Yeah they are 
Is the animation good? Yeah it is
Is the atmosphere there? Initially yeah it is
is the crafting a chore? Yeah, it is
Is it worth $30? No way, maybe for $10 and even then that's for the added fun of co-op

I think The Forest was unique back in 2018, but now it's not. Maybe the hype got to the developers when it came to developing the game? In 2018 you would have thought by 2022 it would have been a borderline AAA title, as it looked like an ambitious title with good graphics and animations, just lacking the funding for polish and content. It's not a flop but it's not great."
17990,Scary 8 legged woman chased me and broke my house. 11/10 for realism
17991,forest VR with multiplayer is a janky though enjoyable experience.
17992,Very good survival combat game good story and very fun with friends
17993,good
17994,THIS GAME IS TRULY GOOD from taking in the nature to running for your life it is so fun
17995,kill cannibal; become cannibal
17996,"nice

17997,Werry good game
17998,very good
17999,"Fortnite Battlepass i just shit out my ass
Booted up my pc cuz i need need 
To get that Fortnite Battlepass
I like Fortnite did i mention Fortnite
I like Fortnite it's night time i mean it's 5 am so it's basically night time"
18000,its lit
18001,i like poking naked tribal people with my stick
18002,Good game final boss glitched so I killed it in 1 bullet kinda lame would like to see better boss fight in future.
18003,I like that you can turn off the cannibals for a pure survival game!
18004,"Creepy, dark, fairly gruesome but fun to play with a friend. It's not one of those games that goes on forever (I suppose you could if you want but it lacks enough content to remain interesting to play for long periods.) The story was definitely interesting and I would recommend it to those who enjoy survival games."
18005,mid
18006,great survival game 10/10 just dont play it with retards
18007,"Much better with friends, still might scream like a child when something sneaks up on you. Built everything, ate a leg, admired my blueberry farm. Would play again and again"
18008,wow what a game
18009,"Going from Normal to Hard difficulty in this game is like going from having pretty annoying neighbours to enlisting in the Vietnam war. Play with friends to see them go from pacifists to cannibalizing the cannibals leaving you wondering who the true evil of the forest is while deforesting an entire island, wrecking the local wildlife and slaughtering hundreds of people. In a quest to save a son that you forgot about 15 days ago. To stay sane; you have to live by a code. Never. Ever. Kill The. Turtles. That is what separates clothed morally ambiguous murderers from the naked ones."
18010,"its a really fun game to mess with your friends on, also just doodling on peaceful is fun"
18011,yes
18012,its so fun
18013,probably good but my friends dont fucking cooperate
18014,"Kinda Scary, part adventure, part survival, part wtf? Explode an island with deep and interconnected caves and tunnels to uncover the mysteries the island holds while trying to survive the island native monsters. 

Better bring friends. Better in VR. Can't wait for the sequel! 

9/10"
18015,one of the best survival games ive played and a great story too.
18016,it appears i was in the forest
18017,cool
18018,"My personal record with dynamite is 13 trees so suck it.

In all seriousness great game, great story, great mechanics and enemies. Cannot wait until the sequel comes out!"
18019,Very good game :)
18020,Dont question me its a good game ok The Naky cannibals try to kill u and u build ur own house and in the words of my freind REEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE

18022,yup fo sho
18023,shi fye
18024,Love the nature
18025,very good
18026,"Favorite game. Few bugs and glitches here and there, but overall really enjoyable. Keeps you feeling like someones always watching you. It's both terrifying and exciting at the same time and I highly recommend if you're into horror survival."
18027,"its a really well made game no bugs, well optimized, and over all fun to play."
18028,"Loved getting harassed, chased and raped by a squad of cannibals, deforesting a forest and shitting myself while getting chased by mutants in dark caves! Playing in VR is awsome!

10/10 would buy again!

18036,enjoy playing with my brothers
18037,sons of the forest betta be good
18038,This game is good gotta wait for the second one
18039,"this game was pretty good, but only downside was my computer kept crashing but i dont think thats the games fault. Overall this game is good for people who enjoy horror or gore type stuff. It was a challenge to beat but it is a really enjoyable game!"
18040,"was absolutely shitting myself the whole way through, crying and laughing bc of my friends, mate put nature through my gaff twice never wanted to break my pc more, if you enjoy spending 1 hour trying to build a house buy it but if you and your friends are too serious still buy it idc"

18046,"this one kinda came outta left field for me. i originally bought it just because it was available in VR, played it a few hours and kinda forgot about it til some friends got me into it again, but the game play and mechanics are well tuned on both VR and flat screen. my only complaint really is for parts in VR that are immersion breaking like the opening cut scene looks really cool being front and center for a place crash but the scaling is off and when it takes you out of first person perspective when you climb ropes or get knocked down is a bit off-putting. but that pales in comparison to all the rest that this game has to offer. the crafting in VR is especially fun. and using the modern bow as well. makes headshots feel extra rewarding being able to actually aim down sight with your hands. and the chainsaw makes me feel like a lumberjack. map traversal can be difficult but never frustrating, although ive yet to play the harder difficulties. but there is always plenty to find so it makes exploring worth it"
18047,<3
18048,"Good Content Map Needs to grow, other then that awsome game!

18052,yes
18053,"Being only 5GB the game was super fun and kept my attention hours on end, recommend playing with friend and NO TUTORIAL. Watching walkthroughs ruin the game and if you do that u might as well just watch a lets play."
18054,this game is good if u have friend to play with it.
18055,Good game. Scary and a good level of difficulty for the survival factor.

18065,"Good game, fun playing with friends. Or your friends who is newcomer. Or maybe solo! Always get good time every time to finish the game."
18066,Great game needs more updates.
18067,great survival game!
18068, gfcvjghfcj
18069,"I enjoy the game somewhat, but the bevy of quality of life issues make it hard to recommend. This game came out in 2018 and the controller support is minimal at best. The default layout is not great, and there is no in-game way to modify it; this is unacceptable for a modern game IMO.

Also, the actions in game can be incredibly finicky. Picking up an item can sometimes require a good 10-15 seconds of slightly moving your character to be in the exact position necessary for the command prompt to appear. Additionally, it's often difficult to even see what button they want you to press because the color blends with the environment.

Combat is boring and shitty. You have an attack button and a block button, that's it. Hit the bad guy a couple times, then hold block until it attacks you, wash rinse repeat. When using ranged weapons, there is no reticle. Sometimes it's not a big deal, like with the slingshot. Other weapons, there is absolutely no fucking visual point of reference at all, so you just have to waste ammunition and probably die in the process.

Graphics are good, theme is good, it's fun to play multiplayer, but the previously mentioned issues bring it down considerably."
18070,The best survival game I've ever played.
18071,"This game was the shit when it released on PS4 and i played it with my friends but uh i just cant find that spark again with this game.
I recommend it to those who have never played it before specially if you have friends i mean come on this is one of the best co op survival games you can play but it is just boring now lol."
18072,"If you want the hair on neck to stand on end, play this game.... [i][b] in the dark!![/b] [/i] .  I bought it on a whim and was not disappointed.
The graphics are pretty good, but I got the game (after watching a couple of videos on it) because I like these sandbox type games that allow for free roam of where you are at.  
There is a number of storylines to follow in the game, which I'm having a hard time doing.  I'll probably have to resort to watching videos on what I have to do to actually ""complete"" the game.  I'm 25+ hours into it & don't think I've accomplished much in the ways of the storyline.  I'm having quite a bit of fun just with the ""base building"" aspect of the game.  I'm just glad there is no timer on the story line. 

It is a bit on the ""gory"" side on what you have to do at times and it's a little disturbing on the types of cannibals you'll find so beware of that if you plan on having kids watch or even play it.  

Mats for construction are quite abundant so no hunting around for them.   That's a plus in my book.

I give it a 8.5 out of 10.  For ME that's high.  

And remember....play it in the dark.  [i] [b] Trust me!!  [/b][/i]"
18073,awesome
18074,NEEDS TO BE CROSS-PLAT
18075,Almost died of a heart attack because of a crocodile. 10/10

18077,HAIYA SIAO LANG EVERYWHERE
18078,very fun caves are nice and detailed and the canniblase are well made and all out fun it is so much fun with a friend though but if you dont have any o well.
18079,"i got murderized by nekid people.... 10/10 i would get murderized by cannibalistic naked people again probably

This is as true as a horror survival as you can get

way ahead of its time, so much content, i played this when it first came out, i think i downloaded a torrent hehe but i always used to try before i buy, at least im honest 
:D
Graphics are beauts#

Sound effects are very effective, very immersive too, they add to the effed up atmosphere

survival is pretty hard and a nice challenge

base building is really cool too, very unique amd theres 2 ways to build a base, prebuilt huts or free building where you can even make the shape of your foundation.

enemies are really creepy mutant like tribal people that are cannibals and they are naked hehe

mechanics are smooth and no issues at all

the map is beautifully detailed with wildlife and fauna looking very realistic

gameplay is perfect, theres literally nothing wrong with this game, its a perfect horror survival game with base building which i love

Highly recommend this masterpiece, cannot wait for the sons of the forest

1000000/1000000 GET IT

10/10 IM CRQP AT GAMES lol

18162,AMAZING game with ur homies!
18163,yes
18164,"I am intrigued by the survival scenario, but I ended up playing on peaceful mode most of the time. Even the easiest mode with monsters was very difficult to build up defense before a hair-raising encounter. There are too many things to do to ensure survival and not enough time, energy, or safety available at first. When I tried to escape from them I found it near impossible and frustrating. I suppose this may be realistic to the scenario, but this is a game. It killed my desire to continue playing.
For gamers who like a challenge it's a decent game, but I think there should be a reasonable period of time at the beginning where there are zero monster encounters; a player could get better set up that way and focus on objectives better. The story is frankly not that appealing to me either. Too generic and makes me think of Fallout 3 & 4."
18165,W
18166,"The Forest is so perfect, the lore is amazing, and i really enjoyed the way the game worked. The game is very old, so the graphics are not that fancy, but the new game coming in May 20 will be as fancy as anything you ever seen! I really recommend the game, but there are some scenes that can get you traumatized."

18254,its a fun survival game
18255,"Let's get one thing straight. Other than the monsters and their designs, this game, is dog shit. The graphics suck, the map is small and bland, and you bug into a wall every 5 minutes. And while the sequel does seem to be improving on almost everything, including the monster designs which were already fantastic, that doesn't excuse the original ""The Forest"" to suck monkey balls. With that being said, this game fucking slaps. Now I've never played this game alone before and I don't plan to because I bet I'd be pretty miserable. But the three times I've went out of my way to suggest starting a new world to a group of friends boggles my mind. Because conceptually, all my previous critiques still hold up. But for some reason, something about T-bagging a poorly rendered zombie with your friends while we're all starving and dehydrated just never gets old. It's such a bad game but it can be so fun with the right group of people. 10/10"
18256,pretty good game
18257,this game be bugin bugin
18258,"Really good game. I recommend playing with an expert, or a friend that's kinda good at it first because it can be hard on your own."
18259,.
18260,"This game is extremely fun to play, it is even more fun to play with friends if you have some."
18261,"I¬¥m at 44 hours played and just decided that it was time to revisit The Forest after I stopped playing it for a while. I guess that the fact that I¬¥m reinstalling now means that it¬¥s pretty good.
I liked the atmosphere of the game and as a survival game system it¬¥s the best one I¬¥ve played so far. I feel like survival games are an attractive idea but I get bored with all the collecting resources and going through a crafting system. This game doesn¬¥t solve that problem for me. Soon you¬¥ll be chopping trees and crafting things but otherwise it¬¥s great."

18377,"Definitely enjoyed the game on single player.
Has a variety of spooky things to come across, slightly challenging, and interesting and decent-made crafting mechanics.
The story-line is interesting, feeding you bits and pieces of lore through exploring caves, camps, and villages.
The best game play is when you're with friends.

The main downsides:
Armor in the game depletes REALLY fast and it takes quite a bit to get enough bones for a full set of bone armor.
Depending on where the game puts you in the start, without any knowledge, you can very easily run into a cave that has very difficult enemies, a lot of enemies, or a combination of both.
The thing that pulled me out of the game was going into multiplayer hosting my own game without cheats enable and a bunch of kids with loud mics somehow used cheats to destroy my buildings while hovering in the sky, laughed when I came to the camp and saw it, and then proceeded to kill me when I ran away.

I'd give it a solid 6.5/10."

18379,Outstanding game. You can follow the story or just survive and it will keep you entertained.

18411,"Beware! Once you begin this game, it takes over your life. You can't go back to normal life, you have to be in The Forest.

My plane crashed. Someone took my son. I seem the only survivor. I pick up an axe from the dead stewardess's chest and run to a safe location with my nifty survival book and my lighter which NEVER EVER gets empty! the book has blueprints for a fire and a shelter. I cut trees, more trees and even more trees. I slaughter birds with my axe and throw them in the fire. I eat birds and drink poluted water until I find a pot. I cook water in the pot yummi. I cook birds in the pot. I catch rabbits, I eat reabbits. Then I need to build more buildings, chop more trees, build a neat cabin and a bigger fire. I need to build traps and a wall so I cut more trees, chop chop. O no, there are the cannibals and my wall isn't finished yet HELP! The cannibals surround me and attack. I dance around them. One steps into my fire the dumbass, haha that teaches him! I slaughter a cannibal with my axe, take his club and smash the others with this club. I cut off their heads and put them on a stick. That will teach them! I cut off their arms and legs and hang them to dry so I can eat it later. I burn what's left of their bodies so I get bones. I make armor from their bones and a spear. I go hunt fish with the spear but what is that? A naked woman trying to kill me? Can't we talk about it? ""You woman, me man, I got this nice cabin there... no?"" She doesn't fall for my charms and attacks so I chop off her head and burn her body, more bones. Her screams alerted more cannibals. I hide in my cabin. They look through the window, I shoot an arrow through their head with my just self made bow and bone arrows. My wall is almost finished, just a few more trees. I must have chopped a thousand already. I got ambushed by more cannibals and mutants, I pass out. They drag me to this cave and hang me to dry. I wake up and they were foolish enough to: 1. leave me alive and 2. leave my belongings with me so I lit my never emptying lighter and see my axe. I chop myself loose and fall on the cave floor. I find meds, soda cans, a compass and a map. I see a rope, I climb up to find myself in a cannibal village. As I sneak away, another naked woman jumps on me. I forgot to take the damn meds and my health is really low. She knocks me out and eats me. Best next thing to sex.

Score 11/10 - would get eaten by naked women again."

18457,"This has to be one of the best made survival games on the market. However the difference between ""The Forest"" and other survival games is the story. Yes, many other survival games have a story all their own, but with ""The Forest"", to me, the story is more of a main focal point of the game itself. I love playing with my friends and jokingly start yelling, ""Timmy! Timmy! Where's my son?!"" (If you haven't played this game before, you play the role of a plane crash survivor and have your son (Timmy) taken the first few moments you're on the island). Apart from the story line, this game is a wealth of fun, especially if you are with friends. The experience of ""The Forest"" is drastically changed when played in a multiplayer setting and the horror aspect is turned from terrifying, to scary with a dash of laughs and smiles. Weird to say, but I feel that's how most horror games are and ""The Forest"" is no exception. Overall, ""The Forest"" is an amazing game and I highly recommend it to those looking for a fun (and what can be challenging) survival game! 9/10 all around!"

18474,best survivel game ever
18475,so fun and im black
18476,"Best survival game of all time 
forgot my kid ngl"
18477,"I watched a trailer of ""Sons of the Forest"" not so long ago and realised that I already own the first game in my library for ages. Finally decided to give it a try and man, this damn forest just sucked me in. It's fascinating. I could not even imagine that cutting trees can be so addictive. 

The first impression was indescribable: first meeting with cannibals, first fallen tree on your log house, first meeting with mutants (with all 3 at once in my case - unforgettable experience), first visit to the caves... It was created just by four people? - unbelievable. So many things are done on such a great level in this game, that it can easily put to shame numerous losers from AAA industry. 

I'd like to mention stylish and ergonomic inventory, fantastic sound design, thrilling atmosphere, overall attention to details 
and of course - great enemy AI. I have not seen such a good AI probably since F.E.A.R. These ""primitive"" cannibals are 100 times smarter than all those super soldiers from CoDs and BFs.  They learn. And you have to learn how to deal with them. 

You can pacify them or make them even more agressive. You can trick or scare them. They can run away in fear and call for help. Some of them are so deranged that can start eating their own fallen brothers and sisters. Others - show compassion and try to drag away wounded tribesman. Great work.

What worth special mentioning - the way developers limited the world. You have a huge island, surrounded by boundless ocean. What could stop you from leaving the island? Try and see. It was such a simple decision but at the same time so emotionally strong.

The game tells me to find some Timmy... Who is this Timmy? Ah, da hell with Timmy! I already spent more than 100 days on this island, established my own religion, building my private village and of course - practicing healthy cannibalism!"

18486,"I have some really strong opinions on this game, this might be the best survival horror game I have ever played. The experience is also elevated by presence of CO-OP. This is a masterpiece, simply put. From the story to game-play to the shivers you feel while playing, the game grips you from beginning till the end. You might not realise what the game has in store in terms to the storytelling. Some think this game is an ordinary survival horror game that relies on jump-scares but the really is harshly contradicting. The story takes you somewhere you might not even dream, let alone expect. Its an absolute must play game for someone who likes a good story that will stay with you forever, just like some of the best thriller movies. In terms of game-play the game offers all you can ask for in a survival game, like crafting, making shelters, gathering resources, discovering new regions, etc. The main focus of the game is in the caves, as you would find hints to the story and more importantly tools to progress in the game. Also the cave experience is phenomenal as the caves are pitch black and you don't have any light source other than your trusty lighter. Moreover there are plenty of cannibals in the caves which further elevates the spooky setting of the caves. 
It takes an exceptional game-play and fitting story to gather overwhelmingly positive reviews which just shows the capabilities of this title. Also this is the first game made by Endnight Games, who are small team with just 4 people(while The Forest was made). It pains me to think that big developers like Ubisoft are launching Far Cry sequels which are completely identical to previous ones and people still choose to play those rather than trying new and fresh games like these. I hope that with a debut game like this, Endnight Games grows and give us more stunning titles like these and would not deviate into more generic game making.
Second part of The Forest is also coming out in 2022 named Sons of the Forest and to say that I am excited is an understatement. <3"
18487,Not well optimized for VR. Couldn't even get 60fps with a 3070.

Very enjoyable to play with ya mates as you travel through the forest and get spooked by the cannibals xD. Can't wait to get my hands on ""The Sons of The Forest"" the sequel of this game."

This game has more cave exploring than forest exploring and base building is pointless as caves feed you an infinite source of granola bars and soda."

18547,The Forest is a very fun game to play. You can join a group of anywhere from 1-8 of random people online and make knew friends or play with old ones. You can follow the story line of the game and unlock creative mode and build to your hears content or you can enjoy the survival game play with your friends. All in all there are many different options for how you could play this game. Give it a shot its worth it.

I won't repeat what's already said countless times here, like how amazing their AI is. Which it absolutely is. But what I will say that previous reviews do not mention is that this game does night right. It's been a long time that a game managed to give me goosebumps and this did it.

Where I was scared to enter The Forest's cave systems, I can only imagine I'd be terrified for Sons of the Forest. I can't wait."

playing w/ friends is even better!!

only cons i can see are some bugs like the deer standing still after being hit, too many duplicating pots, and that's about it. other than it functions just fine from what little i've played."
18606,i played this game for 5 hours straight constinting of chopping every limb of every canibal i saw then eating it and collecting the bones in a basket as trophies then went on to collecting heads of armsys and legsys and putting them on a wall then made a wall full of decapitated baby heads from legsys children then continued to kill every animal i could find and not even take there meat
18607,very gud game and would reccommend since funny(if u havd friends)

Would definitely recommend for a game to buy with your friends. If you're thinking of buying this game soon though, just be aware the sequel is going to come out in a couple months (may 2022). I anticipate the sequel being way better than this game too."

18718,I would recommend buying this game on sale not that there is anything wrong with it. I think the game runs great and has a fantastic story to run either solo or with friends which always adds more to the game when it allows you to run a story while having fun with friends. If you want to put time into making a base or trying to craft or kit up your items it does become slightly boring having to chop down trees or try to get stick but it does help and allows you to get more in depth into your story. But getting this game on sale i feel is just better just in case the interest drops better to pay 8-10 dollars for a game you play all the time then 20 for a game you won't touch after 2 or 3 times of playing but that being said buying it full price and finding out you don't like it you always have the option to refund your game for I believe up to 1-2 weeks either way if it wasn't what you wanted or expected you have some time to get your money back.

18746,"Pretty barebones compared to similar survival games and lacks replayability. It was okay at first but got boring and repetitive after a while; the environments feel really hollow and drab, combat is unpolished and building isn't that fun. The countless bugs that ranged from visual glitches to softlocks didn't help the experience either. I wouldn't say this is a terrible game but I mostly have bad memories of it."

18819,it a vary good game if you like survaivel games. 10/10
18820,great survival game with or without friends
18821,"I'd picked this up a while ago and just not touched it until recently.
I've been playing with my son which is really good experience and the more hours i sunk in the better and more i love it.

If your ever on the fence like i was about originally buying it then my advice to you is pull the trigger. ENDNIGHT are a cracking company and the thought and time they take show in their game. 
Sons of The Forest (second game) is out this year so that's even more reason to give this a try. 

If you need more convincing or tips while playing then check out YouTubers ""Farket"" or ""The Outer Middle"""
18822,OMG i just played for 3 hours! This game is fun with friends!
18823,it good game
18824,Great survival game!

18833,probably one of the best horror adventure games in the past 20 years
18834,"Was a buggy pile of shit, still is a buggy pile of shit."
18835,"Fun, non mechanic heavy horror survival"
18836,good game for men that like blokes. would highly recommend men and boys if you swing that way!!!
18837,"Even if horror isn't your thing, you can still get a ton of entertainment out of the survival aspect. World building is really good. And if horror is your thing, you can't go wrong here. Game play mechanics are interesting and keep you on your toes."
18838,"its cool game, i having a great time in this game with my friend. you should play it even the single player its very fun"
18839,"Love this game! I bought it a while ago, but just started playing again with a friend in anticipation of Sons of the Forest. 9/10"
18840,the video game is silly and fun. the leg monster made me fucking shit myself in vr
18841,"This game is insane, it's as real as reality, defintly a 10/10"
18842,nice
18843,"good survival game, fun to play with friends"
18844,Honestly it's one of the best survival games I've ever played.
18845,Gud
18846,id love if you guys added better vr support i wanna play it so badly with my friends but it runs like poop. its frame rate is capped at like 60 and it doesn't have an Oculus mode which would benefit quest 2 users like me. to me if you guys fixed up the vr a bit or made it a stand alone and made it from the ground up to be vr and not just a port id buy that in a second.
18847,"The locals are very peaceful and friendly.

Definitely recommend playing this with a friend for some fun giggles and spooks. I can imagine the game being quite challenging for beginners / solo players but with a friend it strikes a nice balance between surviving and having fun poking things with sticks.

The survival elements are simple yet nice to use, especially the inventory system. My biggest problem with the game is the desync issues in co-op where sometimes you will not see the same thing as your co-op buddy. General glitches and a lack of polish also hold this game back a bit and it's kinda concerning that they've apparently moved on to a second game already without fixing this one. That being said it's still a blast to play with a friend:)

God speed, gamer"

18855,"I liked the game play, although the I am quite new I can say this game is 1000% of it's money, It's hyper realistic game and it does include some gorey(?) stuff which just adds more depth into game."
18856,The game is very good with many twists and turns. It could be a little scary for a person with a little less life experience.
18857,Hehehe cannibal go RAWR!!

18860,yes dis game is veri kool to pley wit frends and solo kanibal like my  wife
18861,Played this with my girlfriend. First time playing we built a fire place but it was the size of a tree log. Compared to our home which was a shack. Few hours later we‚Äôve  learned how to make really huge places that had a farm and ziplines and all. If you ever wanna know how it feels to be a conquistador well here it is.

18863,"Freaking awesome, difficult and scary as hell at the beginning but tapered off to the boss fights being difficult, depends on where you build your base. Played on and off for a year and a half with my ex and best friend. Will be playing the second."
18864,"Even after 100 hours of play- i still jump at times.
Crafting is solid, enemies are creepy. Caves are dark and full of nightmares."

18886,"Beautiful graphics and lively atmosphere, simple yet good story too. Great for playing solo or with friends especially with people who like standard survival games with a little bit of base building.

Just prepare to shit yourselves when you find a random naked dude, drenched in blood, staring at you silently in the middle of a forest...

18897,"First of all this is an amazing game, I've owned this game for about a year now and it is still a great game to play, now don't get me wrong, this game is fun in all but it does get repetitive very fast, get wood make a shelter, get food, sleep, get water etc, don't ruin the story or look up where to find things. I did it and it was a huge mistake, it ruined the whole game and I don't play it often anymore because of that, but other wise I'd buy the game."

18902,"Really like(d) this game, I was obsessed with it for weeks upon purchasing. Enough so to 100% it before even thinking of putting it down. There are some bugs that I came across while playing, but didn't deter me from continuing to play. Just the log cart getting stuck or flying up into air when placed or just walking it somewhere at random. The ending felt like a work in progress still. I did crash out at the end my first play through, cannot recall what caused it.. Wish the game itself told more of the story, I personally feel like I learned more of the story line/lore from a YT video instead of the game itself. Stoked to hear about the next release from Endnight coming up and looking forward to it greatly."

18920,"The forest is a vast survival mode, and follows a free to explore world. Everything you collect, in various locations along the way adds up to the final ending. The ending, and storyline, are fun are easy to follow. The game is even better when played with friends. I recommend this game!"
18921,Really fun survival game
18922,i like that the AI are so smart but i don't like how you get raided by them a lot. but its good that you can turn off structure damage so they cant get in. i like how its open world and so realistic. you can do pretty much anything you want. 4.5/5 game for sure one of my favs.
18923,i liked the bit where the kid died.
18924,"this game is epic i can do alot like commit cannabilisoumisumoisum (good spelling btw) and kill the tribal people of the island and eat them, there are also spooky enemies like mutants and a flying penis monster. I like to build a big base and survive from the monsters and then 1 runs through my wall and blows my base up like the twin towers (would recommend 14.35274/10)"
18925,this game is fun i love it
18926,20 hours in and still learning more about the game every hour
18927,"If you go into the game blind not knowing anything about it, there is a special experience to be had in the game, slowly uncovering whats going on and unravelling the mystery of the island was really good. 
top tier survival/horror game
VR compatible, Multiplayer works pretty well and the solo survival is actually really good.

If you havent yet check it out if its on sale but it is worth paying full price for"

18934,"While this game took me a little bit to get started, I fully recommend this to any form of survival horror fan. I thoroughly enjoyed playing this game, and I still play this to this day. However, I do recommend playing with friends. It's a bit more grindy when you play single player."
18935,"It has a very obvious story line, the interface is manageable (after you figure out how to do things, that is) and inventory limits are based on numbers of items rather than weight.  The AIs are very intelligent too - which makes game-play interesting because they don't simply run up on you and attack, but can rather attack in a pack and kill you with back-stabs.  Not a game for beginning survival/crafting gamers, but very enjoyable for those who like a challenge."
18936,the screams at night made me go wee wee in my pants
18937,YEET just play
18938,Soooo coool if you play co-op
18939,"chopped trees for 2 hours straight, definitely recommend"

18945,yeh
18946,"First of all, this game is so beautiful and scary! I've played the peacefull mode in solo game...omg it is so calm and I can build lots of things without being interrupt by cannibals constantly. My favorite time in peacefull mode is when I can explore the caves (which are very creepy by the way). In the normal multiplayer game (with cannibals), it's very challenging and I love it. The progression of the different level of cannibals through the time is very interesting and it make you feel constantly in danger. So you have to build many traps and a good ""home"" to protect your things and yourself. Sometimes, it will take you many games to find the better way to do more days without dying, but this make the game so beautiful and challenging.  I recommand this game for all who wants chills, fun and relaxing time."
18947,Nice cool game
18948,gets stale
18949,gud
18950,Big scary
18951,Cool
18952,....
18953,The forest is one of those games where you kinda have to use Google to progress further you don't really know what to do or how to craft anything eventually you get the hang of it. Also the game doesn't take that long to best really all you actually need is the scuba gear and the keycard that's it then you just jump in the middle and swim then boom finale boss. I'm also going to give some tips so yea tip #1when the world first starts cannibals won't really attack you unless you attack them and as the days go one the more you'll see and the more aggressive they become so watch out for that. Tip #2 live by the sea it's a great source of food because of turtles which can be dried. Tip #3 mutants aka the big guys aren't as tuff as you think they usually take on stick kf dynamite  or a couple bow shots
18954,good game had fun me no like canibal tho
18955,The game in my opinion is very fun and is worth playing specially with friends.

More like when you have a really weird disturbing fever dream about your son being abducted by cannibals that come in many shapes and sizes but are always naked and angry. Building was a lot of fun, the survival aspect is just right to keep you entertained throughout the day and give you an incentive to grab materials to advance further into the story and world exploration. Combat isn‚Äôt that bad at all, actually quite fun to try and figure out what‚Äôs the best combination of weapons to take a heavy-hitting cannibal down fast. Lots of funny moments and good memories ahead but I would recommend playing with atleast 1 extra friend because I could see the single-player becoming difficult and the solo work being demotivating towards progression."

But what I will say is, this games sandbox is unironically one of the best I've ever played in."
19011,"I remember my first time playing, I set up my base at the beach right in front of the plane crash site. A couple of days in, I look at one of the cliffs and I see a small group of cannibals just watching me from afar. That's when I realized how great/scary the AI was. I could have never looked up at that specific cliff and saw them, but they would have seen me. Makes me think how many times I haven't seen them. Also playing with friends in vr is the funniest thing in the world, just seeing everyone start swinging there arms trying to hit the cannibals is the funniest thing in the world. This game is really amazing and it is really fun :)"

19045,"Nearly the most unintuitive UI I've ever seen. The aiming mechanic for the spear makes it random and nearly unusable. Crafting is a friggin' mystery. What can you make, how do you make it, how do you get a weapon that allows you to actually kill things? These are all good questions that ultimately require going and reading a forum or watching youtube walk throughs.

19067,"Day 38... Exploring the caves with the boys... stumbled across the holy grail of the island... ""The One Who Hums""... a small fragile naked cannibal who hummed with the power of a dying sun. Hums that made time itself stand still. He did not attack us. He was at peace knowing the power he withheld inside himself. At first we stood at a distance observing this creature of beauty... soon we were sitting side by side. He stopped humming at one point and at that very moment life seemed to have no meaning... no purpose... then he broke out in a symphony of hum. We danced and we pranced and circled him. Then the level 4 noob appeared and lit him a flame... the Forest went silent for years to come... much love."

19105,good game:)
19106,"Hi, I'm writing this for both the game developer and the players: What's good about the game? Quality, enjoyment with friends in this big world, simple construction almost flawless and many other things that you may know better than me.

But the negative points of the game: (which I want the manufacturer to fix) ... Lack of fabric and lack of alternatives in nature is a big problem that can cause:
1- You will not have a rope
2- You will not have bone armor
These are the greatest applications of fabric that can protect you in construction and resistance to the enemy.
Leaf-covered armor may be an alternative, but it is not effective.

Lack of cooking tips (for cooking food with a pot) in the survival booklet.

* Excessive attack on the enemy during construction, even normally, there is no safe place to build on the map! Except in the water, which makes it impossible for us to build a house in the forest.

Lack of other wildlife such as bears, tigers, bees (which can be used for medicine or food or even poison for weapons), snakes and insects that can be a challenge to treat.

And .... not having a torch to search in the cave or at night, so that we only have to find our way with a lighter!
Why is there no option to make a torch using wood, a little tree sap and fabric or tree leaves?

But with all this, it is a good game. I hope the basic problems of the game are solved with a little creativity.
Good luck."

19146,"This game gets worse the longer you play it. It starts out very fun, but if you manage to make it to the end you'll experience limited gameplay variety, horrendously inaccurate bordering on unusable maps, impossible to find required items, and more frustrating hangups in an otherwise good game. Definitely a fun game to just try to survive, but if you decide to go through the full main storyline it becomes obvious that the experience is not as polished as it could be"
19147,"played this game with a friend. with just both of us, we manage to accomplish quite a fare amount of stuff with limited knowledge of the game."

19151,"One of the most fun games I have played to date. The horror and scare factor of the game is perfect - really most of it plays off the fear of the unknown and exploring caves... Great fun solo, even better with friends. Super excited for the next game, Sons of the Forest"

19168,like it
19169,"It does something that survival horror should strive to be, half survival and half horror.

You see, most SH games go too far with one of those categories, in The Forest its balances both and goes strong.

Example, during the survival part its kinda cozy but during the horror parts its extremely unnerving. Also it ties both well with the atmosphere such as when you could be chilling by a fire during the night and then hearing the shouting of cannibals is the distance and then shortly after they show up and you can barely see them in the small radius of light your fire gives."

19178,Saving that child was not worth it but good game
19179,BEST GAME EVER 10/10 PIECES WOULD PLAY AGAIN
19180,"If you are a fan of the open world survival craft horror genre, then this is undoubtedly THE game to play. Solid 10/10. This is a must play for so many reasons.

Excellent balance between survival, crafting, combat and ""creep factor"". The cannibal AI is awesome. They are intelligent and unpredictable which is one of the best and most terrifying parts of this game. The survival aspects are simple and effective. The core survival mechanics of hunger/thirst/sanity/warmth are enough to keep you busy without becoming cumbersome. The game strikes a fantastic balance between moments of pure beauty as you explore this incredible island landscape contrasted against the horrors of the cannibals. The sound design is extremely effective at both informing the player and at creeping you out. The story is solid and between surviving, defending your base and progressing the story, you will have plenty of quality gameplay.

The base building is a beast all its own. You can setup a simple effective base with just the essentials. Or you can build a towering fortress to exert your dominance over the local population. It is easy to spend hours upon hours tweaking your defense, perfecting and stocking your base with all manner of resources. It's extremely rewarding and addicting. The building mechanics are simple and intuitive. Alternatively you can go with the minimalist approach and build everything you need to survive on a simple small raft (bed, drying racks, water collectors and fire pit). This makes you immune to all enemy attacks as they can't reach you on the water. The small raft is the easiest and safest 1st base which you can put together within 5 minutes. From here you can build a bigger houseboat or start constructing a land base while having a safe place to run to if/when SHTF.

I've had this game in my library forever and I finally had time to start playing it recently. I am so glad I did. This game is a masterpiece and I am really looking forward to the sequel (Sons of the Forest).

TIP: If you are struggling with visibility at night or in the caves change the color grading to M131 in the display/graphics menu. For a truly terrifying experience leave the color grading on ""Original"" and don't adjust the night/cave brightness slider."

19201,"What can I say? I'm a wuss and play this game in creative mode where the only thing that can harm you is falling off a cliff. I just like to build things in games and don't care to be bothered by screaming cannibals or rushing to build. I build to relax rather making myself stressed. This game gives you many options of how you want to play; from downright peaceful to easy, normal, hard and nightmare (something like that). Perhaps one day i will play the game on normal mode and in VR. Currently I am playing it on PC using keyboard and mouse. From my understanding, you can play this game on multiple platforms."

You can bring friends, but the more you have the less scary the threats of the island will seem and you're more likely to buckle down and go to war with them. It's honestly an interesting game but your mileage may vary. Peace is always an option. You could even try not turning cannibal yourself, not sure if anyone has ever tried that."

19232,"Easily one of my favourite Survival games and one I go back to time and again, alone and with friends.

While I couldn't care less about the main goal of the game (besides escaping) it's fine in general, the real beauty to this game though is the small details, things like the way you cut a tree that gives it a realistic feel or the rabbits that breed when penned, and something that seems to blow everyone's mind is the enemy NPCs, I don't know how but the way the developers designed the NPC AI makes it seem like they have infinite possibilities in terms of the way they behave and react to your actions. 
I've tried to replicate certain things in the hopes of getting similar behaviours from them and failed multiple times, but that gives the game such a refreshing long term playability. 
The crafting and building in the game is very free, a lot of trial and error, and gives you a sense of accomplishment when you've built a camp or filled your backpack with interesting and useful items you've created.
There are some small gripes I have about how many of certain resources it takes to build certain things, or how long it can take to build a substantial base, but honestly it's not important. 
The VR implementation is absolutely magical too, so even long after you've figured out this game you can jump into the VR version and become truly immersed in it like it's brand new.

Overall this game is incredible, I highly recommend it for survival fans and for multiplayer fans, and I should add, it has given myself and one other of my friends and actual, real-life panic attack on separate occasions, because of an unintended jump scare (by us not paying attention), if that doesn't entice you into playing I don't know what will."
19233,"You can eat a guy here
Bear Grylls approved"
19234,"Day 69
----------------
My friend group have became total psycho after staying too long in this island, one friend reveals himself to secretly be a cannibal who have an obsession with eating the native cannibals's legs. The calm and reserved one became a bloodthirsty hero-complex murderer who jump headfirst into slaughter, and the rest made a cult worshiping femboys and they have been branding the cannibals as heretics and have been trying to convert the cannibals by means of killing them ever since.

"
19284,"I‚Äôve never been terrorized, stalked, or fascinated by enemy AI quite like I was in The Forest. It‚Äôs a harrowing survival ordeal that knows how to play with tension and create the sense of a real world with complex inner workings and mysteries I was eager to discover. It‚Äôs I Am Legend told in the depths of the hinterlands, with a meaningful story progression that doesn‚Äôt overstay its welcome. Disregard the warnings on the walls and hidden between the trees at your own peril ‚Äì and if you want a unique and memorable survival horror experience, then you should absolutely dare to do so."
19285,good

Only give 9/10 because there are some bugs here and there but thats about it."
19290,.
19291,"really fun with friends to explore around and create stupid shit
cant wait for the second game!"
19292,If you are reading this. Stop scrolling and buy this game now. It is a gem of a game. Played best with friends.
19293,Very good game. Fun and scary even with friends but probably even scarier alone.
19294,This game has way too many hidden mechanics (and far too many more partially-implemented ones). I shouldn't have to spend 10 hours reading an independent wiki before feeling comfortable starting a new game.
19295,"Got eaten by a shark, then a crocodile, then fell to my death. Cannibals never got me though!"

19297,"Good game with friends, but not without they."
19298,"This game came out ages ago, and I've played it since it's release, got my steam copy for VR.

Amazing game, I absolutely refuse to play it 2D/Desktop mode after launching it for the first time in my VR headset. I'll leave it at that."
19299,"Great game with an interesting and quite deep story. Im a bit biased because I played it with the best gaming buddy anyone can wish for, so my review is about coop experience. The coop works smooth. With all honestly it would be way too scary for me to play on my own, specially the cave exploration (fck you bats). If you enjoy exploration and survival, you will love this game. Looking forward to the next part!

Pros:
Well working coop
Enjoyable graphics
AI of enemies
Base building with traps, treehouses and houseboats
Super scary caves
Great story

Cons:
Not enough incentive to actually build a base
I want more!
Not much of a replay value (for me personally), its a been there done that kind of deal
"
19300,"Fun coop game. If you know, what you are doing, it can be completed quite fast.

Cons:
- little monster variety
- no essential need for building the base
- sometimes clunky controls and AI behavior (getting stuck and such)

Pros:
- Fun coop
- Monster AI behaves in unpredictable patterns
- Atmospheric
- The story contains some twists that are fun to uncover

Looking forward to sequel."

19337,Very great open world survival horror
19338,"The game is very fun, especially if you are playing with friends. The Story is somewhat short, but not the main aspect of the game imo. Its about the survival."
19339,If you are going to play it with friends it is going to be great fun messing around but i would wait for a discount and i wouldn't play it alone since it doesn't have a big story.
19340,Yes
19341,"me kill cannibal, me have fun :)"
19342,good way to use extra time of your life if you have all the time in the world
19343,Probably the best survival game out right now.
19344,good  game made me poo my self
19345,great horror survival game to play with your friends (or by yourself if you're crazy)
19346,"In general the game was fun.
The story was interesting.

But I think in regards to crafting then subnautica is better.
The problem with the forest was that you can build a ton
of stuff you never really need. Like the house boat.

I also nearly did not use traps. I did not build one single wall.
It was just not necessary.

The style and graphics were alright (water was mediocre but forest
was good).

What I did not like was the way of finding equipment. I ran allover
the whole map and placed some markers. Then I figured out that you can find
a map in one of the caves. This map will then show you locations which you visited.
Sad for me: it only counts from that point when you find the map. All my discoveries
before I had to do again.

Same for caves. One of the caves was not marked as finished for some reason. I then went back etc.
figured out that you need to use climbing axe to ""trigger"" the event. I just jumped down so ...

Fights are pretty cool. Enemies can surround you pretty fast.
During the game you will find a lot of cool equipment.

But game is still buggy. Had 2 crashes and some minor stuff like crafting made 
all of my berries disappear etc.

I can only recommend this in a sale.

EDIT:
forgot to mention my main issue with the game: the caves are so stupidly dark. I could barely see anything. Even on highest brightness. It was so difficult to navigate. I wanted to play without mods. This lights should have been a little more powerful etc."
19347,its a nice game
19348,10/10
19349,im just here for the boobs
19350,Love it
19351,idk what to say else thats its a great game
19352,In my opinion u need balls of steel to play the game because if u play it alone its creepy af so its better to play with friends :)
19353,Gotta love building a base while being attacked by people who want to eat your face.

It has a lot of bugs and has aged a bit, but still i would recommend this game to everyone.
10/10 pure fun
also the Community is kinda funny.

there are boobies but they aren't nice to you. 
which is surprisingly normal in real life too actually?"
19370,"Nice game and good story tbh
"
19371,"It makes for a really fun time, especially when you've got one guy screaming he's ""been up and down the same beach four times and there's NO TURTLES"" and another one speaking jibberish in a cave halfway across the map because he decided to go running off towards death without us :D"
19372,"Don't be like me and get a little too close to the fire and accidentally light yourself on fire. Your friends will not appreciate having to revive you. I speak from experience. A little too much experience...

This game is so fun just don't be as stupid as me. At this point my friends are my babysitters."

19377,yes
19378,"I beat the game twice, The first time was a terrible free mode ending and the second one was a god awful cut scene that made my incel of a son have an epileptic seizure after i cut down a tree with a big black man. This game is fun until you play it the way it is actually intended. I can honestly say that I would rather slam my nuts in a car door than ever play this dirty booty hole of a game that was made by a bunch benchords."
19379,people eaters
19380,this game was good but the endings are absolutely expired horseradish
19381,"It's a good game, i recommend it playing for once, i got bored playing it for the second time and the achievments.

It has a nice story but not awesome, i would give it a 8/10.
The gameplay is so cool i give that a 10.

I rate the game 9/10

19410,"this is a great game i like killing the canaballs then cutting up there limbs
but i do hate hackers and cheaters on my server"
19411,mmm
19412,"The Forest is a survival game with good combat, a large map, and an incentive to *actually explore and beat the game* (unlike other games I have reviewed).
The story is that you were going on a plane somewhere with your son named ""Timmy""
The plane crashes and you (or a few other people if you're playing multiplayer) are the only survivor(s) of the crash. You look around and see a flight attendant with a hatchet lodged into her chest. You pull it out and you use it to collect resources and to fight the nearby cannibals and, a little later into the game, mutants. These guys will attack you and unless you set up a fort you're going to be doing a lot of dying. I would recommend building a base overtop a cave entrance due to the fact that if your base ends up being overrun you could escape into the cave and stock up on supplies that you can find down there, and go through and alternate entrance to escape any mutants or cannibals at your base. I won't be touching the storyline all that much to avoid spoilers but the final boss was a little underwealming. Just a little more health and damage than a regular mutant. It would die to about 7 flare gun shots. The fact that you were basically givin free medicine and food and water made me expect a lot more than what there was. In conclusion, this is a pretty good survival game with a lot of insensitive to beat the game and a good story."
19413,"Good game, make me poop my pants."
19414,crawling baby i fucking shate my pantes
19415,pretty cool so far

19425,"It's painful, I love it."
19426,"I like taking bones from other living beings, excellent game."
19427,very fun
19428,"It's just so simple of a survival game that doesn't go immersion breaking. None of it is you grinding up to these outlandish gadgets and towers, it's just you getting basically QOL upgrades to make everything easier. The AI is great and can actually surprise you at night where it's tense, atmosphere is great, caves are terrifying and claustrophic. And it all works with friends 8.5/10."
19429,Cut down trees and enjoy Minecraft but with Anxiety
19430,its fun to play with friends recommended for people who is trying to find games :)
19431,"Overhyped, extremely buggy. Here is a short list of my complaints

1. A friend and I built several rafts that kept getting glitched onto land and stuck on tiny obstructions in the water. Also rafts are pointless as far as I can tell because the inner waterways are almost impossible to navigate with a medium sized raft and there is no benefit to building a raft in the ocean as there are no islands.
2. The game doesn't distinguish between dried food and raw food which makes drying racks a pain
3. The hit registration from certain enemies is atrocious and the physics is even worse. Ever been punted into the skybox by a monster that is facing away from you?
4.Flashlights taped to any tool or weapon are invariably useless as it points at the top right of your screen
5. Tropical salt water fish living in fresh water ponds. Giant Monitors and Rabbits living in harmony. Seriously?
6. Controls revert to default every time you open the game
7. Lighting molotovs, dynamite and fire arrows is insanely tedious. Throwing the two former weapons is also janky as it uses a floor reticle, which would be acceptable if it didn't scroll at a weird angle and if it were actually accurate.
8. The developers decided this game was finished and have decided to work on a sequel rather than make this game good.
9. The developers quit working on this clearly unfinished game in order to make a sequel.
10. The developers are satisfied with this and think it deserves a sequel.


The game gets crafting right though, and it gives you a lot of freedom in placement which is very good in my opinion. Gathering resources and exploring is a lot fun in this game, but after 18 hours and 4 raft bases that literally beached themselves and several deaths to projectile drop kicks from that fat zombie bastard, I have a hard time seeing myself ever playing more."
19432,Game is very fun with friends. It also allows VR!
19433,Yes
19434,its a very fun horror/survival game with tons of ideas and things to do filled with creativity and the multy player is sooooo fun.
19435,Best when played with others.
19436,"mega fun survival game
"
19437,"this is a really really fun and good game. It has slowly creeped its way into my my top 5 or 10 of all time. Its funny yet scary yet challenging and satisfying, and it looks beautiful for its time and compares well to many triple AAA titles today. Love this game, very excited for the new one. 

Only caveat, needs to be easier to dupe megan and bring her home, fuck timmy he a pussy ass bitch coulnt even fight back bozo bozo bozo we stan megan and megan only"
19438,Spooky. Difficult. Fun.

19441,its scary
19442,its addicting
19443,"I took a few weeks off from Rust and this was one of the games I was recommended to try from friends. I enjoy that it's strictly a co-op/single player and only PVE. It's a nice change of pace from PVP/FPS games. 

1. The story occurs through items you find and through cut scenes. It is not a deep, or lengthy story.
2. The tools and weapons are nice. I strongly recommend using the modern axe over the chainsaw to build strength!
3. Building bases is fun. My friends and I would build mini cities/settlements I suppose.
4. The Cannibals are pesky and challenging at times. Git gud with the bows or hack and slash them with the Katana!
5. The mutated creatures are challenging. They can be quite aggressive and damage your base. Lure them away!
6. The sequel is coming out this summer from the looks of it. I look forward to playing it!

19474,"Been watching a YouTuber known as [b]Lanceypooh[/b] since a long time ago and even before then I used to watch a YouTuber known as [b]Farket[/b] through which I got introduced to this amazing game which I had wanted too badly to get my hands on since a long time and when I finally did, I took an experience I thought I would've never got to experience especially after watching that much amount of videos and for that much amount of time. Playing it by myself just seemed to have more fun than one could ever have had imagined, in basic language this game is yet another one of those games that deserve the pennies especially in the sale prices for these games which shouldn't be neglected at all whatsoever. If you're into Survival games which aren't gonna give you much problems especially when it comes to System Requirements (just have a 64-bit OS for sure) then go for this as well as getting to feel the experience of being in a Forest. (as the title suggests) A graphics card with even 4GB VRAM (GTX 1650ti)  isn't enough for maxing out the game though which is OK for me as for a game being in development from 2014, but other than that - as for running in a decent PC, it'll do more than just okay. The multiplayer component is probably the one you're to enjoy the most so yes, it does work well as more and more old players are starting to play it once again while waiting for Sons of The Forest as well. Go for it while having a blindfold up your eye - it's [b]fun[/b]."

As in any survival game we will eat a lavish 5 meals a day.
I decided to make a small cabin at the cost of half the forest.
There is also a civilisation of nudists living in the forest. They are supposed to be a dangerous enemy, but they are an absolute joke. Just started a new game? Just run at them and start violently swinging your axe and laugh at their demise.

This game is boring and poses no challenge. Though somewhat fun with friends and there is a decent story, I don't recommend this game."

19493,"The Hog Rider card is unlocked from the Spell Valley (Arena 5). He is a very fast building-targeting, melee troop with moderately high hitpoints and damage. He appears just like his Clash of Clans counterpart; a man with brown eyebrows, a beard, a mohawk, and a golden body piercing in his left ear who is riding a hog. A Hog Rider card costs 4 Elixir to deploy.

Strategy

His fast move speed can boost forward mini tanks like an Ice Golem in a push. At the same time, he can also function as a tank for lower hitpoint troops such as Goblins as he still has a fair amount of health. Most cheap swarms complement the Hog Rider well, as they are nearly as fast as him and usually force more than one card out of the opponent's hand.

The Hog Rider struggles with swarms, as they can damage him down and defeat him quickly while obstructing his path. Barbarians in particular can fully counter him without very strict timing on the defender's part, though be wary of spells.

A Hunter can kill the Hog Rider in 2 hits if placed right on top of it. However, if you place something in front of the Hog Rider, the Hunter's splash will damage the Hog Rider and hit the card in front of it more.

The Hog Rider in conjunction with the Freeze can surprise the opponent and allow the Hog Rider to deal much more damage than anticipated, especially if the opponent's go-to counter is a swarm, or swarms are their only effective counter to him. Skeletons and Bats will immediately be defeated by the spell, while Spear Goblins, Goblins, and Minions will be at low enough health to be defeated by a follow up Zap or Giant Snowball.

However, this strategy isn't very effective against buildings as the Hog Rider will take a while to destroy the building, giving the opponent ample time to articulate another counter.

Against non-swarm troops, it can deal a lot of damage during the freeze time, but this can allow the opponent to set up a massive counterpush. For this reason, players should either only go for a Hog Rider + Freeze when they have other units backing it up from a counterattack, or if the match is about to end and they need to deal as much damage as possible.

It is not a good idea to send in a Hog Rider simply to destroy a building, especially if it is the only building targeting unit available, as defeating Crown Towers becomes substantially more difficult. Spells or simply waiting out the lifetime of the building are more effective. The exception to this is an Elixir Collector placed in front of the King's Tower. If a Hog Rider placed at the bridge, he can destroy the Collector for a positive Elixir trade, though the damage from both Princess Towers will usually mean he does not survive to deal any damage to them. However, if the opponent sends in defending troops, it can be an opportunity to gain spell damage value.

In a deck with several low-cost cards, it might be worth it to simply send the Hog Rider against one building. These decks shuffle their card rotation quick enough, that they will arrive to their next Hog Rider before the next building arrives in the opponent's card rotation.

Long-ranged troops like Musketeer and Flying Machine can snipe those buildings, preserving some of the Hog Rider's health, possibly allowing it to get some Tower damage.

When there are buildings placed in the middle to counter the Hog Rider, understanding the placement of the Hog Rider and the type of building placed can help the Hog Rider to bypass certain buildings.

Passive buildings such as spawners and Elixir Collector have a larger hitbox than defensive buildings; which means that if a passive building was placed 3 tiles away from the river in the middle of the opponent's side, then it is impossible for the Hog Rider to bypass that placement as the Hog Rider will get pulled to that building.

Defensive buildings have a smaller hitbox than a passive building, which means if that if a defensive building was placed three tiles away from the river in the middle of the opponent's side, a Hog Rider placed at the very left or right side of the Arena may be able to bypass it due to its smaller hitbox.

If the player has a building already placed down in the center of the arena, and the opponent tries to bypass it with a Hog Rider at the edge of the arena, they can use certain air troops to push the Hog Rider towards the building as it jumps over the river, effectively denying the bypass attempt. They must be already hovering over the correct placement, as very quick reflexes are required to correctly perform this technique.

For Bats, Skeleton Dragons, and Minion Horde, they should be placed right in front of the Hog Rider as soon as it is deployed.

For Minions, Skeleton Barrel, Mega Minion, Flying Machine, Electro Dragon, Baby Dragon, Inferno Dragon, Balloon, and Lava Hound, stagger the above placement one tile to the right if the Hog Rider is placed on the left side of the arena, and vice versa.

They can also use ground troops to achieve the same result. Something like an Ice Golem deployed at the Hog Rider‚Äôs landing spot will obstruct his path and force him to go around the unit, which causes him to be closer to the building instead of the Crown Tower.

The Hog Rider can kite Very Fast non-building targeting troops due to his own Very Fast speed and building only targeting if he is placed on the fourth tile from the bridge, slightly into the opposite lane. He can also stall grounded units when placed right at the bridge. He will pull them towards him while deploying, and then be untargetable by them when he jumps over the bridge. After landing, he will pull them back. This can be useful when the player needs to deal damage in the same lane they are defending. It will also help separate troops behind a tank in a large push.

A Tornado placed on the second tile front of the player's King's Tower and staggered two tiles towards the Princess Tower will activate it without any damage dealt to the Princess Tower, helping them in defending future pushes. This can also be a method of mitigating all damage dealt to a Princess Tower, but doing this more than three times may result in the King's Tower's health being low enough to be targeted directly, opening up the possible threat of a back door three crown. A better alternative is to pull the Hog away from the Princess Tower into the attacking range of all three Crown Towers, which will negate all damage as long as none of them are already distracted

A very powerful combo is the Hog Rider, the Musketeer, and the Valkyrie, typically referred to as the Trifecta. The Musketeer will defend against most troops, while the Valkyrie can protect her and the Hog Rider from swarms or high damage units. The Hog Rider is used to deal damage to the tower.

This can be effectively countered by Lightning, one-shotting the Musketeer and severely damaging both the Valkyrie and Hog Rider. The Minion Horde is also effective, but the enemy can Zap them and the Musketeer will one-shot them all. Even if the Musketeer is defeated, the Hog Rider and Valkyrie will have enough time to severely damage the Tower.

The Hog Rider should be placed behind the Valkyrie to give it a boost so that it stays in front of the Hog Rider, protecting it.

A Hog Rider combined with a Goblin Barrel can be awkward for the opponent to defend against. Timing it so that the Hog Rider is tanking the tower shots for the Goblins is the most effective way to deal damage. However, a Barbarian Barrel can shut this down with minimal Tower damage for a positive Elixir trade, as long as the Goblin Barrel was placed directly on the Tower."

I've 100% the game, I've speedrunned it, I did practically everything in it.
While it is buggy at times, there is a satisfying complexity in its subtle simplicity. Fighting enemies is exciting and scary (when playing it first time), exploring caves progresses the game in a great way, and building big, huge tree forts and complexes is just the best. So many great things from this game. I highly, highly recommend this game."

19599,"The Forest is the survival-horror, where you need to kill aborigens, mutants, collect food, research caves, and on the end to fly out from this island or stay there forever. I almost forget to say you the name of the island, its is Peninsula island, it has very long story. There are 4 mutants, they are: Virdginia, Armsy, Cowman and babies.
The best way to kill Virdginia are bombs, for Armsy are arrows ( or bombs ), for Cowman are the hairspray and lighter, for babies it can be even a stick. In the game you are playing for the game hero, his name is Eric LeBlanc, and you need to save his son, Timmy LeBlanc. I really like this game!!"

19621,"This game is a blast with a friend or two, but only with a friend or two. If you try to play alone, the story is really difficult to follow because it doesn't point you in anything but the most general of directions. Exploring, messing about, and getting startled with friends is what makes this game so fun (at least for me). Playing it alone makes it feel almost pointless and hollow. I do really like the building in the game though. It can feel a bit clunky at times, but generally you can build whatever you can think of with enough ingenuity."
19622,SOMETIMES THE ZOMBIES HAVE BOOBIES
19623,fun and scary
19624,"        Le for√™t. Der Wald. El Bosque. The Forest. No matter which language you speak, where you live on this planet, or what a forest looks like for you, it often suggests the same universal concept: a separation from society. It is this universal trait which the developers of The Forest are well aware of and have made palpable through their harrowing survival horror.
	To begin, every element of the game is a product of the setting. While this may be true in some respects for many games and media, few titles use the setting with as much versatility and application, squeezing from the setting: the mood, the tone, the atmosphere, the conflict, and even the plot arc. The forest alone demands the player‚Äôs respect. One must forage for food and water to maintain their energy levels in order to keep their endurance levels up for completing work as well as for surviving interactions with the brutal, cannibalistic denizens of the island on which the protagonist has been marooned. 
	Pause. Cannibals? Yes, cannibals, and no, certainly not zombies. And how terrifyingly refreshing these horrible people are as antagonists, and antagonize they do. Part of the setting, the cannibals are a tribal people riddling the island in groups, even families. There are hierarchies to their order, which you will occasionally be able to identify based on their dress, but more impressively‚Äìconsidering a programming standpoint‚Äìby their behavior. I must break the immersion here to laud the incredible AI of the enemy throughout this game. From the few things I heard about this game before playing, I figured you built a fort and survived waves of cannibalistic monster-zombie things as long as you could. That is not what this game is and to debase it to such an idea would be to vastly undermine what the developers have achieved. There is a great variety to the enemy, they have different strengths and tendencies: some aggressive, some more observant and standoffish, some hauntingly complacent. Let it be said that when it finally does come to fighting them, it is a primal challenge. They are strong and can kill you with a few hits, especially if they are armed. And launching into a melee with more than one is a gamble, especially as they will retreat and regroup with incredible speed. I could say so much more, but you should find it out for yourself; interacting with them is absolutely intense and a wonder to behold from a psychological standpoint.
	Back to the setting and progress of the game. Much of the gameplay has the player fighting to survive the landscape. If one can last long enough, they will find themselves gathering resources: primarily sticks, rocks, logs, and food. If successful, the player can build a fire, cook a meal, and with persistence, even build a respectable shelter, of which there are many varieties, and considerable freedom for a totally custom cabin of any size and shape the architect (the player) decides.
	A player could probably survive in the world while building a minimal shelter from location to location and living a more nomadic lifestyle, but that is not how I wanted to play. I greatly enjoyed building a cabin complete with defensive walls and traps all around, customizing it to my needs and wants, so that in the interior of my walls was a nearly completely self-sufficient compound. It took me many hours, but it never felt like a grind, as gathering resources takes time, but only enough to keep one from being careless.
	And this is where, again, I must stress the power of the setting in this game. I have never played a game that so literally gave me the sense of being home. This game defines what a home is. Is it where the heart is? I suppose it can be (especially if you decide to become a cannibal yourself) but to me, it was about security and respite. Mind you, none of this was scripted by developers, it simply happens through your own interaction and decisions in the world. For example, I chose where to build my cabin, and I chose it strategically. After completing my compound, I felt a true sense of accomplishment, not only that, I felt like I had separated myself from the incessant dangers of the island. Starting a fire in the black nights granted the respite I mentioned. Beyond the walls, I would hear cannibal‚Äôs footsteps in the grasses nearby, or their howls, or barks, or shrieks. And while I felt such respite in my cabin‚Äìmy home!‚ÄìI knew my safety was never absolute. I had to defend my walls many times and many nights from raids. After surviving, it showed me where I needed to bolster my defenses. This is a major part of the beauty of The Forest: nothing but the setting and your own tribulations tell you what to do or how to do it, and as time goes on, you learn more, and become much more effective at surviving. As this happens, you get braver.
	You will eventually push into the forest. And you will eventually step into the caves. Not because it is scripted, but because the setting will drive you to do so when you feel you must. Where the forest itself is beautiful yet unnervingly tense, the caves are black and timorous.
	The caves are dwellings of nightmare. Your progress through them is dim, slow, and myopic. You‚Äôll hear sneers and rustling in the impenetrable dark, only to see a face and muscled body breach the light of your flickering lighter. Filled with gore and evidence something misanthropic lives there, the caves are always desperate, and you will want it to end the entire time, making the moment you see daylight true relief. Upon reaching the surface once more, you will walk much lighter as you return to your cabin, which by this point will solidly be defined as home. If you reach home, you will want a drink‚Äìperhaps both in-game and in real life.
	It is in this way that the setting also creates the narrative. I could write so much more on this, but I do not want to spoil it for you, and to do so might dampen your experience. I will say, though, that the narrative I experienced while playing this game is the most profound I have had in about two years (ask me which game made me feel as strongly). However, where that game had a beautiful, literary, rich script, thousands upon thousands of lines long, The Forest must have a script of fewer than even a hundred lines. Yet through the introductory sequence and the ending sequence, you realize that this game embraces the videogame medium so beautifully, so artfully, and that realization will elevate the entire experience for you. Without spoiling anything, I realized that, again, the setting is the narrative; the programmers created an introductory sequence and a conclusion, and all the decisions, actions, and events you decided to make create the unscripted plot arc of your story. This, to me, is embracing the medium. In a movie, you observe snapshots of wondrously staged realities, where what happens will always happen to those characters with imagery that is crafted for you, but granting unique interpretations. In a book, you read otherwise impossibly detailed perspectives of events and characters with beautiful language, which spark a unique image and connection in every reader. Videogames are about choice and interaction; they are about controlling and affecting another reality; whether or not deeper meaning is made from it is up to the player, but made more present by the developer. The Forest perfectly demonstrates this in a way that is universal. Through such a minimalistic script, the developer somehow weaves incredibly profound themes of loss and possession; survival and morality; to have and have not. 
	I cannot recommend this game enough, and I will not forget the fifty-hour experience I had with my first play through.
        Hell, I didn‚Äôt even touch the multiplayer. I bet that‚Äôs good.
        Overall, I give this game a sublime rating on my patented reverie-scale of ‚ÄúThree weeks of pre-sleep ceiling-stares with frequent, innumerable, future ceiling-stares to come.‚Äù"

19636,"Survival game that has just enough survival aspects to not be overly annoying and inconvenient. Keeping up with hunger and thirst is actually not hard. You can even build a rabbit farm for infinite food and build rain catchers with turtle shells for fresh water whenever it rains. Really fun to play with friends. Without spoiling the fun and the mystery of it, the caves are where the interesting stuff is at.

Pros:
+  Interesting story with a lot of mystery. You can look up the wiki which I recommend unless you want to figure stuff out for yourself. This would take a LONG time to do so... I recommend using theforestmap.com for finding any tools, weapons, hunting sites, etc. that you may need. It's very buggy in the steam browser though so take care.
+ Combat is fun. Lot of choices for offense like, bow and arrow, katana, clubs, molotovs, handmade bombs, spears, a flintlock pistol (if you have the will to find and assemble all of the parts. A bomb are needed for each part), etc.
+ Lore is interesting
+ Mundane additions like the music player, and birds landing on your hand, show attention to detail and make you feel immersed
+ Derpy physics can be extremely funny with friends
+ Things get easier as you progress and find tools and build

Cons
- Although the physics can be derpy and funny, it also leads to things being unpredictable. During combat, or low-health situations, you will find a slight to moderate loss of control.
- Hit boxes are a bit weird for ranged attacks. You can get used to it but even I still have trouble landing arrow shots
- Sometimes the enemies glitch as if experiencing high-ping in Call of Duty
- Free building in this game has no way of measuring and is completely eyeball reliant
- Without a wiki/map a player would find it extremely difficult to play the story"

19653,"This game has everything in it: cool weapons, challenging enemies, caves, mysteries, very nice landscape, and many other  things. But what i loved the most about the game is the story, a dad which tries to find his son."

19682,good game lots of fun with friends
19683,"how do i get a refund
"
19684,"Great with multiple friends, especially when they make a bit fuhhed up jokes about the cannibals.
Great graphics, good story.
Pretty decent crafting system.
Good Fighting system."
19685,"It's not meant for everybody, to me it is just lackluster in the experience it offers, the graphics are too realistic it makes me feel I am in some forest, and that bores the crap out of me. It gives the vibe that you are totally alone, with nothing to do but set up a log house and survive. I'm sure it would be fun to play with a friend, however not everybody has that option available to them. I haven't joined servers so I have no right to judge however that experience may be but it's definitely a game you would enjoy to play with someone close to you, if you have that option."
19686,Cowman is scary to your base
19687,Game is fun but changeling and gives u a since of real survival and it can be scary if ur alone lol  takes a lilttle time to get good at but thats part of the fun its like alot of other games but it stands out as its own nothing else i have played is like it if u like building exploring open world killing even canablizum this is ur game the limits are up to ur own mind so play and enjoy u wont regret it
19688,i love this game its a fun game to play with friends and the story is really good i recommend you play this game

19695,Can't help but love a game where you destroy the forests and kill the natives.
19696,Didn't like it.  Not sure why it has gotten so many positive reviews.  Didn't have any idea on how to get started.

19704,nice
19705,"This game is truly good. It's a really fun survival game, whether you're solo or multiplayer. You can discover alot of stuff throughout exploring the map. You can build up defenses, your own house, you hunt for food.. The struggle in this game and its creepy vibe really makes it an enjoyable game. It's way more scary playing alone, but so much fun when you're with friends. Exploring the caves and dying multiple times, getting lost 24/7, losing your stuff, it's very entertaining. I recommend this game."

A game that keep the players interest by having the ability to shape the environment for your survival with many option to building, design and style, with a bit of creativity and many hours of constructing your impenetrable fortress you start to feel worried about it being attacked by the co-existing island dwellers."

19799,"Not going to lie, this game took me a little while to get into.  I played it for about 5 or 6 hours and put it down, not touching it for about 6 or 7 months.  But then I saw it popping up again on reddit, so I decided to give it another try.

Boy am I glad I did!!  It turned out I was approaching the game the wrong way (as in more of a base building game, much less of an exploration/survival style game... which as we know doesn't work out too well if you're a newbie). After watching a 15 minute video on Youtube about the different styles in playing the game, as well as a few do's and don'ts, I jumped back in.  And I played non-stop until I beat it.  I never played with a friend, only solo, so I can't imagine how much more fun this could be if you had a buddy to play with.

This game is fun, scary, exciting, and rewarding.  Definitely work every penny! 9/10"

19834,Should 110% win awards if it hasn't already. So well made. Only complaint is that the building in the game is practically pointless unless u just want to for no good reason. Building a home doesn't help progress in the story it only serves as maybe some minor protection.

Luckily they were nowhere to be seen when I woke up so I emerged from the cave, went back to my hut on the beach and continued savagely slaughtering trees like an angry woodsman till I'd built a wood empire that even my missing father would be proud of. Finally completing such a vast project I can get on saving my kid Steve or whatever his name was.  

9/10 for the travesty that is I can't befriend any of the crazed Island dwellers to have them live with me and raise a child who won't get themselves kidnapped on an unknown island."

19918,"If you haven't played it yet, there's still time to before the sequel, Sons Of The Forest is released. I consider this game exemplary of everything a good survival game should have--base building that will itch that creative urge, some heart pounding suspense moments, a beautiful open world to roam, and--perhaps most importantly--a good story driving the whole thing. You'll uncover the mystery of the island as you play, which gives players that much more motivation to continue exploring and discovering up until the point you begin to piece things together--at which point you'll realize the story is perfectly set up for a sequel. Luckily, one is coming."

Very satisfying game mechanics and graphics although the first time I played I thought the propelling of the main story to be hard to trigger, lots of roaming around trying to find clues. (Which is good if you like that kind of thing.) Gave me plenty of time to learn the game before entering the end game I suppose. I bought this forever ago and I still play it with my friends so 9/10 and good for long term playing."

20000,very great game
20001,"Two complaints up front.  Darkness is a problem, and unfortunately none of the fixes are completely adequate; I found myself sitting by a save point just waiting to go to sleep so I could have some light to work with.  Second issue is that I spent a whole lot of times my first playthrough cutting down trees and gathering materials, and when I started the game over, doing all of that work again felt like a slog.

Other than those, I think this is a fantastic game.  Enemies are pretty interesting (although, there isn't a huge variety of them), once you get used to how combat works it gets fun.  The crafting is cool.  Some of the more obscure items will require some research to locate (you'll never find them all on your own).  All in all, it's a lot of fun, and it has emotional content.  Great graphics and sound.

I highly recommend."
20002,good game friendly axe hurts good yes
20003,"Fun game if you have friends to play it with,
the  story is just too short don't beat the game that quickly"

20010,"I've never completed the game but have spent several hours on multiple platforms playing it. I really didn't care much about the story, but loved building up a camp and defending it from the mutations in the woods."

20026,"this game is pretty fun. it's a mix of survival and horror and I like that. one annoying aspect is that one second your just building you base, or collecting items and all of a sudden there's a gang of  five cannibals ready to attack you. all in all it's a great game. worth the 20 bucks"
20027,"A nicely done game, played it with friends, got the best times. Looking forward for the sequel :)"

20054,"After having over 30 plus hours on the forest i must say. The forest is a wonderful game to play with your buddies to play with, but it might get tedious if you don't have someone to play with. You will then¬†become bored if you don't¬†have any friends. and after words become¬†quickly¬†bored and disinterested in the game."

20092,"Content was extremely lacking. I had 1 save and I ""completed the game"" but didnt get the achievement. The game just majorly needs more things to do. The need of a base isn't even required. If you plan to play to make a cool base. There's not much of a point to do so."

20128,cannibals are a sustainable and renewable food source
20129,best survival game
20130,A lot of content to explore you'll definitely get your money's worth out of this game. The survival aspect isnt so overwhelming that you cant focus on objectives making it very immersive

20132,"This game is very interesting, very entertaining, and its good that the game can be played on PC and VR.

20212,There's so many things you can do in the forest it's so addicting. The story is a bit boring but the gameplay holds it up good. Let's hope that The Forest 2 is more exiting story.

20214,This game has a fairly realistic feel to it.  It incorporates creativity with basic survival and a robust enemy suite that includes superior speed than the player.  Enemy mobs behave in different ways depending on player stats and behavior.

20240,"Game was fun, with 4 people the game isn't quite as scary as it could be solo or with one other person. Playing with 3 other people made the game very easy. Overall the map is barren which from an immersion point of view makes it represent ""The Forest"" but gameplay-wise it doesn't add much. I wish the game had a bit more to do than just find Timmy. The story feels mysterious but a little underwhelming if you don't check out all of the tapes. 

7/10 good but lacking the extra mile to make it great."

If you're on the fence about the game, allow me to sway you. This is one of the most thrilling, scary, exhilarating, and push you to the edge of your seat games I've ever played. It incorporates survival, thriller, horror and base defense in the most incredible way. 10 out of 10 and can't wait for sons of the forest to hit stores."

20269,"About five years ago I lived downtown in a major city in the US. I've always been a night person, so I would often find myself bored after my roommate, who was decidedly not a night person, went to sleep. To pass the time, I used to go for long walks and spend the time thinking.

I spent four years like that, walking alone at night, and never once had a reason to feel afraid. I always used to joke with my roommate that even the drug dealers in the city were polite. But all of that changed in just a few minutes of one evening.

It was a Wednesday, somewhere between one and two in the morning, and I was walking near a police patrolled park quite a ways from my apartment. It was a quiet night, even for a week night, with very little traffic and almost no one on foot. The park, as it was most nights, was completely empty.

I turned down a short side street in order to loop back to my apartment when I first noticed him. At the far end of the street, on my side, was the silhouette of a man, dancing. It was a strange dance, similar to a waltz, but he finished each ""box"" with an odd forward stride. I guess you could say he was dance-walking, headed straight for me.

Deciding he was probably drunk, I stepped as close as I could to the road to give him the majority of the sidewalk to pass me by. The closer he got, the more I realized how gracefully he was moving. He was very tall and lanky, and wearing an old suit. He danced closer still, until I could make out his face. His eyes were open wide and wild, head tilted back slightly, looking off at the sky. His mouth was formed in a painfully wide cartoon of a smile. Between the eyes and the smile, I decided to cross the street before he danced any closer.

I took my eyes off of him to cross the empty street. As I reached the other side, I glanced back... and then stopped dead in my tracks. He had stopped dancing and was standing with one foot in the street, perfectly parallel to me. He was facing me but still looking skyward. Smile still wide on his lips.

I was completely and utterly unnerved by this. I started walking again, but kept my eyes on the man. He didn't move.

Once I had put about half a block between us, I turned away from him for a moment to watch the sidewalk in front of me. The street and sidewalk ahead of me were completely empty. Still unnerved, I looked back to where he had been standing to find him gone. For the briefest of moments I felt relieved, until I noticed him. He had crossed the street, and was now slightly crouched down. I couldn't tell for sure due to the distance and the shadows, but I was certain he was facing me. I had looked away from him for no more than 10 seconds, so it was clear that he had moved fast.

I was so shocked that I stood there for some time, staring at him. And then he started moving toward me again. He took giant, exaggerated tip toed steps, as if he were a cartoon character sneaking up on someone. Except he was moving very, very quickly.

I'd like to say at this point I ran away or pulled out my pepper spray or my cellphone or anything at all, but I didn't. I just stood there, completely frozen as the smiling man crept toward me.

And then he stopped again, about a car length away from me. Still smiling his smile, still looking to the sky.

When I finally found my voice, I blurted out the first thing that came to mind. What I meant to ask was, ""What the fuck do you want?!"" in an angry, commanding tone. What came out was a whimper, ""What the fuu‚Ä¶?""

Regardless of whether or not humans can smell fear, they can certainly hear it. I heard it in my own voice, and that only made me more afraid. But he didn't react to it at all. He just stood there, smiling.

And then, after what felt like forever, he turned around, very slowly, and started dance-walking away. Just like that. Not wanting to turn my back to him again, I just watched him go, until he was far enough away to almost be out of sight. And then I realized something. He wasn't moving away anymore, nor was he dancing. I watched in horror as the distant shape of him grew larger and larger. He was coming back my way. And this time he was running.

I ran too.

I ran until I was off of the side road and back onto a better lit road with sparse traffic. Looking behind me then, he was nowhere to be found. The rest of the way home, I kept glancing over my shoulder, always expecting to see his stupid smile, but he was never there.

I lived in that city for six months after that night, and I never went out for another walk. There was something about his face that always haunted me. He didn't look drunk, he didn't look high. He looked completely and utterly insane. And that's a very, very scary thing to see.



overall it was a pretty fun game"
20270,if you're a fan of survival games this is a great one for a great price!! BUYERS DO BEWARE - be careful if you work from home because I do and I have accomplished very little this week because of the game.  10/10 recommend
20271,"This game is perfect for those who like open world, survival, horror, and massive freedom to build. If you're lazy and do not want to collect resources there's a way to get unlimited resources and if you're too scared of the enemies in-game there is a peaceful mode."
20272,"I may have small play time, but this game is incredible. I have over 300 hours on playstation.

 First off, the game is relatively easy to pick up, the controls are simple and easy to understand. beginning off is exiting and thrilling. First few in game days you will have likely done some exploring and ran into a few cannibals - Even at this point the game is enjoyable, simple base building and survival right? Not really.

The storyline in this game is one of the best out there. even to this date (2022 Feb) the exploration is incredible, large wide landscape and a huge mess of cave systems. LOADS to explore. even myself after playing over 4 years haven't seen every inch of the map. Even the miniature side story's are very immersive, knowing other people have crashed there and you aren't alone. Through exploring the cave's - for the first time - you will find stronger enemies and mini bosses. Terrifying and thrilling. Along with exploration, new items, new things to craft - one time only item drops and loot drops if you die. Difficult but fun.

The story plays along a character looking for their kid. The more you explore the map the more you find out about the story, how sinister this island is and whats on it. Solo or multiplayer the story is enjoyable, role play possibilities. Going into the endgame is so thrilling. The story so in depth you feel like if you die its over. It no longer is a game it's a mission you have to complete.

Even after you defeat the final boss there's more options for you. End the game and leave the island, or stay. Leaving will mean you lose the world but unlock a creative mode - even more possibilities. Staying on the island means new over powered items are able to be unlocked, questions answered that you have asked through playing. The longer you are on the island stronger enemies appear on the surface aware of you. Secret caves you might find.

This game is limitless, its also beautiful. Outstanding Graphics for it's age. I would HIGHLY recommend this game. ALSO a sequel is due May of 2022. There is so much more i can say about this game, but in short - It is one of the best survival games out there. Alongside it's top quality storyline and in depth gameplay and enjoyable replayability its 1000000% worth investing the small amount of money for this masterpeice.

Have an awesome day <3"

[h1]""Bugs, bugs and once again glitches""[/h1]
And that quote accompanied me the entire game. It is broken in almost every inch. The list of bugs I encountered throughout the 40 hours of gameplay is almost endless:
- Disappearing items
- Duplicated items
- Problem with logbook entries in caves
- Items that cannot be picked up
- Disappearing armor
- A falling tree will not destroy a rabbit cage made of a few sticks, but it will destroy a gazebo.
- Disappearing injured animals
- No water in turtle shells despite the rain
- The immobilized rafts
- Practically all sounds
- Being thrown to the desktop
- And many others

Playing alone is pointless. Two of us on normal difficulty find it difficult to go through the caves - I dread to think how you can do it alone.

I have to say that I'm sad and disappointed because this game, without all the annoying bugs, would deserve at least 8/10 for its interesting and unique story and atmosphere. Unfortunately, until the developer fixes his game (which is unlikely to happen), the rating remains in the low range.

[h1]Tips:[/h1]
- Respect every tape you get and make bombs out of them immediately - you'll need them, and you can never have too many tapes!
- Build birdcages - a very quick way to get feathers and thus arrows
- Logbook entries often pop up [b]ON TOP[/b] of cave entrances
- Mutant heads count towards the ""Trophy Hunter"" achievement (easier to get than geese heads)
- The ""Longest wall"" achievement is not about a palisade, but about the wall of a building"

20342,GOAT Game
20343,"Its a fun game to play, you have so many options what to do & its fun exploring the world.
Would recommend if you like survival games w a realistic touch."
20344,well written
20345,"It's almost alarming how quickly this game pulled me in. The setting is a worst case scenario primitive survival response, and the fear is made real by the constant threat of whatever is making those strange sounds near you... And the inventory-and-crafting set up is pretty unique, quick and fun. Definitely should give it a try!"
20346,"This game is amazing. I can't stress this enough. It tells a story in such an open-ended and non-invasive way that many games never seem to have done before. While cut-scenes exist, they are few far and between and most of the story is told directly with how you interact with the world. The island that you find yourself marooned on contains so many secrets and it is your responsibility to find them as you are given no exterior story telling that can tell you how. And when you do find the pieces of the puzzle, it is up to you to put them together and interpret them. If you like games where you can build, but you also like horror games, this game is for you. I appreciate just how realistic the survival aspects to this game feel."

20384,"Reviewing after playing more than 400hour, 

You are looking for a survival game with a great story & playable with multiple friends? Yes this is what you are looking for. The forest is still the best survival game i ever enjoyed my life even compare to minecraft it have good graphics, good gameplay & great story. I suggest every single person if you got some friends just make sure you play it. 

Graphics : 7/10
Gameplay : 8/10
Story : 10/10"

20402,nice game
20403,goodm game but its very scary D:
20404,"This is a fun survival game I originally bought to play with my friend, and I ended up playing it by myself quite a bit, definitely gonna play this some more eventually, this game is awesome!"
20405,"The network design for this game is incredible. I have awful internet with 1000+ ms ping, and I'm still able to play co-op with my Steam friends just fine. I don't know how the game manages, but I'm able to play co-op in a full 3D environment with an expansive base-building system, and still engage in combat with minimal frustration. 

And speaking of the base building, it is some of the best I've seen in a survival game. While the actual design elements are simple and limited in scope, you are given a surprising degree of freedom in how you use them."
20406,"Good

20409,"The game is whatever honestly, would have been better without all the gore. and you arent safe anywhere, there literally no point of building a base so youre just there. the spawning is whack, and theres an abnormal amount of body parts of people and a random lab in the middle of a cave. 

what i majorly didnt like was the enemies being children or using children for sacrifice.  

Really demented game. Steer clear, you arent missing much."

20423,love this game!
20424,"I did not play this game on release, I didn't even think I would like it. To be perfectly clear I didn't give it a chance until I saw it had VR support. All of my gameplay has been in VR.

What this game does well:
Creepy sometimes scary aesthetic for a large amount of the game. Base building and survivalcraft with SOME tower defense mechanisms. Exploration is a must for better equipment and learning the secrets of this island. Narrative and story are not cutscenes and long books but instead found as subtle hints or drawings in the game world. Says the game has been around since 2014 (alpha) and I don't see a mod community making the game look graphically better. Even still, the game looks and plays like a relevant 2022 game.

What it could do better:
VR floating hands leave something to be desired, even if the best game of all time in VR does the same thing. Using both of my hands to do things would be amazing but my right arm is the only one getting a workout LOL. 3rd person movement is a bit quirky and weird on ropes and such. It could have a sequel out with VR capabilities right now. Honestly these are all minor gripes, they've done a great job here.

Conclusion:
This is a whole game. A whole game with a better than decent VR port. IMO SkyrimVR (not modded) doesn't even compare to this in terms of playability. If you enjoy survivalcraft games and need a VR experience...please consider this one."
20425,"Recommened. Must try game.

The building mechanic is kinda weird, but it's just different from the other games I play. Had a lot of fun last Friday, streaming with 2 other players. The three of us were able to build stuff and kill things so we could survive for 6 or more days straight.

20500,A good game to play if you like survival and monsters. If you just want the casual experience of survival without monsters you can simply make a world without the monsters implemented.
20501,so awesome
20502,very good game very enjoyable
20503,"Game would've been fun if it were 2 hours long and had no combat. Literally every single design choice was working against the narrative, except for maybe the killer soundtrack and audio design. If the sandbox were a different mode like in Long Dark and the story had it's own map to itself this would've been a much better and more immersive experience. As it stands right now, there's maybe 5 minutes of a playable game buried under a generic unity survival sandbox."
20504,"√Ø think it very pro game.
You can kill woman and look at the booba so very good game yes"

Keep me running...

20511,"THIS GAME IS MADE ME CRY IN 10 MIN.  VR is terrifying. i wont play it by my self. you need to get it tho. 10/10 for tree
"
20512,"I‚Äôve bought this game, to play with friends and family. 
It seemed, like a fun horror-survivor game. 
And it is. 

However, after about 3-5hrs the zombies/natives/cannibals, whatever you refer to them became obscenely annoying with constant boss spawns near our camp, despite us making sure not to leave their (or really, any) bodies around. We destroyed all the totems, and were mostly mocking about, but the constant harassment of the AI quickly killed our fun.

All in all, it‚Äôs a good game, and I‚Äôd still recommend it if you like fighting against increasingly impossible odds. 
Just be ready for the constant harrasment from boss zombies, which‚Äôll quickly eat through your inventory.

20533,Great game to play with friends. Would recommend.
20534,The game is lacking in the most basic of features relevant to its genre. Anyone who enjoys The Forest either has extremely low standards or a very dull mind.
20535,"I'll give the game a good review because my friends and I did have a lot of fun playing this game, but some of the things that you do in the game are pointless. 

The only goal is to go through caves in order to get items. Things like: building bases, hunting, etc. are pointless because the only thing you need to do is go through the caves. 

My friends and I spent hours making a base, just for it to never be used."
20536,O jogo e bom Joaquim!!!!!
20537,"this is a great game lots of fun can be had whilst playing so i would really recommend this game to other people 5 stars.

20543,yes
20544,"Overall, solid game that is very fun to play. Things can get goofy when you play with friends, but overall the atmosphere stays consistent throughout. I was personally disappointed with a few of the achievements - it felt like some milestones should have been achievements and others shouldn't have been - but that is a small quibble with a generally enjoyable game. There are a few ""casual"" bugs that typically made the experience comedic as opposed to being game breaking. Would recommend to folks looking for a decent survival horror game."

20547,good game
20548,"solo or multi, pc or vr...any way you look at it this is my favorite game on steam by far. the optional storyline and every increasing chance of death around every corner. keeps you on your toes and gets a little creepy! a must have to anyone that likes the genre."

7 Minutes and 29 Seconds before

1 Minute.
Awaken inside a crashed Plane.
Hungry. Got Food from around the Seats. Found also Medicine.

2 Minute
Got a little Axe from the Corpse of a Stewardess.
Jumped down from the halved Plane.
Nice Graphics. Love the Forests Beauty.
A Bird was landing on my Hand my. Nice little guy.

3 Minute.
Using my Axe to open Suitcases.
Found cloths, a duct Tape, Medicine and‚Ä¶‚Ä¶ a Tennisball.

4 Minute.
Turn around from the Plane to throw the Tennisball away, got shocked from something in front of me, i didn¬¥t hear coming.
My Health went down and i got unconscious.

5 Minute.
Animation from me getting pulled somewhere.
Found myself hanging from the  Ceiling, somewhere in a dark Cave.
Freed myself from the Ropes.  Looked around. 
Urghhhh, a Passenger also hanging from the Ceiling and his inside was hanging outside if you know what i mean.

6 Minute.
Trying to see something in the Dark, having only my Pocket Lighter.  Fascinating Light effects .
Hearing a shrill scream out oft he Dark.
Something is jumping in front of me.
A Cannibal or something.
Got me by suprise and killed me.

7 Minute.
Staring at the Screen, stunned from the Atmosphere of this Game.
Opening my Discord. Loosed a Bid.

https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2752545455

Yes my dear Readers, i haven¬¥t play anything like this before.
On the first Hand i¬¥m a little feared of playing this Game alone again, on the other Hand it is such a fascinating and addicting atmosphere that whispers to me: Come back. Come baaaaack.
And yes, i came back. With 2 Friends. Thanks to B. and N. for the amazing Time together. 
We played both Endings.

Shortly, your Plane crashed on an island, your Son was kidnapped after the Crash, survive and find him.
THE FORREST is an awesome Survival Game, with an exciting Story that slowly unfolds and drives you on to find out whats going on, with an outstanding Sandbox System and highly intelligent Enemys.
These are no dumb running into your Weapon Enemys, no they are organized and act as Teams. 
They revolve you, they call other for help and they flee when you damage them to much and come back if when you don¬¥t await them most.
And they are really, REALLY scary when the night comes.
You will hear them Sream and you don¬¥t know where they are. 
So build as fast something safe with the ressources of the Forest.

https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2752544867

Eat, drink, build, craft, fight, explore, SURVIVE!
That is all you have to do and the Island has much to offer, if you learn to survive.
Do it alone or with Friends, what is pure fun.

THE FOREST is a Masterpiece in the Ocean of Games and an absolute Must Have in every Game Collection. I bow myself to the Developers. 
And i¬¥m looking forward to the next Part SONS OF THE FORREST coming in May.
THANKS!

And thank YOU for reading.

20597,"The survival mechanics of this game are too easy and too annoying at the same time. 

The island is too small and there's nothing interesting on the surface.

 Base building has a lot of options but is pointless because settling down in the same area increases the risk of being attacked by the cannibals, so it's just better to move with a temporary shelter.

Maybe it is funnier with friends, but I found the solo experience rather boring."
20598,hell yes it such a good survival game its fun alone with friends but you need B A L L S   O F S T E E L to play

20618,this game goated
20619,"Would recommend even though I haven't played multiplayer yet. It is a fun survival game but you really have to guess what you can use to craft different things. For me I built a whole log cabin, a house boat, and a gazebo in the first six hours of gameplay and 1/4 of the forest is gone. Lets just say the cannibals aren't happy about that one."

20621,"First play was fun, getting achievements was not. Experiencing this game for the first time is a treat for anyone. Beyond scary and interesting. Crafting is unique yet annoying too. But do not play this game more than once because it will stain the image that it has initially."

20627,AMAZING GRAPHICS SO FUN ABSOLUTLY RECOMEND
20628,"First real survival game I've played, in addition to it being my first semi-horror game.  I went in rather timid, but managed to find my way.  The Forest is incredibly well done, with suspense, paranoia, and a little bit of horror.  For anyone out there who shares the same fears of running through the unknown, I urge you to try out The Forest.  Learning curve isn't too steep, but the game won't be holding your hand either.  The game is very enjoyable alone, or with up to 8 other people.  I would recommend playing either alone, or with a single friend, as anymore then that can possibly break some of the immersion you will experience.  All things considered, incredibly beautiful game.  I would give it a solid 8/10 for the overall experience."

20642,"do not listen to the other positive reviews, this game is absolutely terrible, mechanics are horrible, enemies dont give you a chance to breathe. overall the game company should remove this game from steam and think about their mistakes."

20650,pretty spooky
20651,One of my favorite games growing up I kept going back even after I finished the campaign truly adored it. It offered a lot of terrifying feelings when I first started playing I remember going into the first cave terrified at what might pop around the corner. After that honeymoon phase of being scared of everything because it was new the game felt like a blast I was always messing around with my friends and doing stupid shit because we could it was a blast definitely recommend this game.

20686,Wish I would have played this game at the height of its popularity. I decided to give it a chance before Sons of the Forest comes out later this year. Good survival game and way more enjoyable with friends. Search for Timmy while fighting cannibals and mutants or play as bob the builder and create a bunch of forts for no reason like I did.

20707,fun
20708,Absolutely a fantastic game. Very fun with only a few bugs and glitches here and there. The only thing I hate about it is that it is not available to be played on Apple computers. i believe that games as great as this one should be able to play on any kind of computer. It is also especially saddening that some people can only use Apple computers for a number of reasons and are unable to play it because it is only able to be played on Windows. My daughter has to use Apple products because that is the only brand compatible with her hearing-aid and she was so excited to have found out about this game to play with me and her sister only to find out that she couldn't download it on her computer because it is only available for computers that use Windows. I hope that maybe someday this game can be available to everyone regardless if they have a Windows computer or if they don't.

20743,its just janky and not fun
20744,Pretty good game worth the money but gets boring fast.
20745,"This is probably one of the greatest survival games to ever grace this Earth, and there's a multitude of reasons for that.

First of all, very few survival games manage to deliver such an enticing story with an absolutely mindblowing ending, and even fewer manage to do it solely through clues and events instead of the usual mixture of dialogue, notes and so on. The Forest not only manages that, but it manages to balance it well with the survival aspects of the game. It's like there are two layers of gameplay here; The Forest - the survival game, and The Forest - the mystery/investigation game. Puzzling together the pieces of what happened while you try to survive through hordes of cannibals and mutants is an amazing addition to this game.

And let's talk about those mutants for a bit. They are properly terrifying. Beyond just being a survival game, The Forest is also a full fledged horror experience. While learning to fight off single mutants doesn't take a particularly long amount of time (they are quite dumb and you can easily cheese them, especially if they come at you one by one) that doesn't stop them from feeling like a constant threat to you and your encampment, as you can get easily overrun. A couple of Armsies and some cannibals barging through the woods can easily turn a nice morning where you went out fishing into an intense battle, while hearing their approaching roars in the caves can chill you to the core.

Finally, there's the building aspect of the game. While the building system isn't as impressive as it is in some other games (the building mostly consisting of preset objects, with quite few custom options available) there are still enough options to satisfy most people who enjoy building in survival games. The custom foundation and custom walls will be your best friends when trying to build your house in your own unique way, while being able to run platforms and bridges along trees is a nice touch as well. The building can sometimes get tedious, as you have to bring each and every log that's needed for the construction over to the building side either manually or with a cart - you can't just magically shove them into your inventory - but I do feel that this more realistic approach to building feels right at home in The Forest, and I don't think a more ""advanced"" system would've worked qute as well. You're a crash survivor after all, not a builder and architect!

Overall, this game is an incredible experience, and definitely among my favorite games of all time."

20764,The Forest in VR is amazing. Best multiplayer VR experience. So many laughs and so much exploration!
20765,"This is one of the best multiplayer story games out there. It is never boring and you always have stuff to do. Also, the lore is really interesting as you can find fragments across the map that tell you the story. I would say this game is totally worth buying."
20766,play
20767,gud
20768,just nice cant wait for the next one
20769,"One of the best survival games i've played in a while, the suspense that this game build whenever you go into a cave or go of adventuring is scary but makes you want to do it more, the atmosphere that this game has aswell is another reason why i would recommended it to anyone i know, if you're playing singleplayer you truly feel alone and have to rely on your knowledge and instinct to not die, whereas when you're playing multiplayer you feel actually like a group of survivors trying to not die. you have to share with your other teammates otherwise its pretty much game over. the story is really interesting aswell, it makes you truly feel for the character your playing as and makes you want to figure out more each step of the way. it could've been made a bit better however because i have noticed ill get frame drops and stuttering even on the lowest of settings and the game feels a bit too easy in the later stages which personally i dont think should be the case because it takes away the horror and suspense that makes this game so good. Overall, this game is a amazing survival game and anyone who plays it will be in for a treat :)"
20770,Very good game with very polite people with special diet
20771,i liked this game
20772,GAME SCARY AF DONT PLAY NOT FOR KIDS

Really like it when birds sit on your hand."

20789,"plese award mee
ill give you a game"
20790,"It's a good survival game but flawed in many regards:
[list]
[*] Clipping, oh man it gets annoying to see myself or someone I play with just levitate or clip through objects. Especially during preset animations, they never seem to match from other person's perspective;
[*] There seems to be [spoiler]an invisible wall midway down the hole if you decide to build a rope and go down that way. Glider works, from what I've seen jumping from a zip line into the puddle works so why can't I rope down?[/spoiler]
[*] The alternate ending does not give you the Survive the Forest achievement (finish the game). If it's considered an ""alternate ending"" why not? It would've been cool if I actually had to do something [spoiler]after I decide to crash another plane, not just watch it go down and bam, black screen, one year later whatever. The same way alternate ending let's you continue playing, the ""right"" ending should let you too, at least to some extent.[/spoiler]
[*] Getting [spoiler]the artifact[/spoiler] feels worthless. Not because the zombies (I know it's cannibals but I couldn't be f*cked to differentiate) are too easy on normal difficulty but because [spoiler]it literally has no God d*mn story significance. The cave collapses if you chose to emergency shutdown so you either end the game by creating another 9/11 or play in your little ""creative mode"" with a spike-ball that either repels or attracts zombies.[/spoiler]
[*] What does the S.O.S. sign do again?
[*] Why can't I use a flare as a torch? You know, weapon in one hand, flare in another.
[*] Some caves feel... empty. For example [spoiler]there was some underwater cave which we couldn't go in because we had no scuba gear. After getting the gear from another cave, we went back and lord and behold, there were f*cking coins all over the floor. That's it, just a deep dive for some coins which I can't even use because you get way too d*mn many to ever have the other components for explosives and I'd die of old age before I use them all on vending machines in the laboratory.[/spoiler]
[*] [spoiler]I don't feel like Indiana Jones going through the whole map to assemble a gun that takes ages to reload.[/spoiler]
[*] [spoiler]Why is the kid bass boosted at the end there? During the live show tree cutting cutscene, the kid looks like he has several strokes at the same time. You'll find that either disturbing or the funniest sh*t you've ever seen. Is it intentional? Or is just the animation that f*cked lol.[/spoiler]
[*] The combat is.... eh? It goes back to the clipping issue.

But, overall I believe this game excels at things other survival games don't: crafting, base building, exploring. You know, the very thing a survival game is based upon. Considering it's 16,79‚Ç¨ full price, I'd say it's a pretty good d*mn game."

20796,I think I hear something in the woods...
20797,"Both great and bad at same time. It has great graphics. The layout is solid. But it has a unfinished feel to it. Like when you build if your not exact you get caught up on things getting you stuck. There are some things you need a lot of, but no way to store any off them except by cheating like skulls. Sure you can store skulls in a catapult but then you need to launch them to collect them. Things that you need up front like a map need to be found. Once you know the area no prob but before you learn you will spend hours wandering around aimlessly with only just a few reference point super easy by look. You will have to change your video settings to play it. There is no light in a cave. And what they give you for light only lights up two foot in front of you on normal settings. So you need to play with the brightness and gamma to be able to see at all what your doing and thats with still adding lights. Things like fire dont last long, its easier to keep them lit more then most games as you use leaves to keep them lit, but i'd rather have a fire i had to put wood on that lasted more then 5 min tops. The night cycle is so weird. If you dont sleep on time exactly you will eventually be moving the time at which you can sleep resulting in you playing at night and sleeping in day. Is it fun Yes but it feels unfinished in alot of areas, and worse yet the devs havent put out a update in over a year so i doubt there still fixing it. Oh sometimes you will be fighting while standing on something it gets bumped or something and send you and it flying 20 foot in the air to land and die. Ive played 20 hours and got 100 kills and it says less then 25% that purchase this game get that. So it makes me think people give up from all the quirks to quick."

From screaming and running from cannibals to singing sea shanties while exploring the shorelines it really is a fun game to play with your buds. I haven't done the storyline, just running around like idiots but I hear the story is cool."

Veru spooky in vr and on pc its no spooky i only survived 30 min before i ALT + F4 because it was night and i saw a big black man. i give it 10/10 on pc because no spooky and 10/10 on vr because good but little buggy but no spooky.

20847,"The game is like minecraft but with better graphics, and scarier enemies. The realism in this one when it comes to island survival is on point because you can barely see anything at night, plus you get hungry, cold, sick, etc.

Definitely recommend this to anyone looking for survival games to chill with. You can also use the developer mode to toggle creative mode and explore everything."

Oh, and she chose the guy who bought her a fckin stuffed seal... 6hrs of hard labor and pours my heart out < $80. I think my math is correct. Women aint shit."

20881,this game has great atnmosphere and amazing sound design the visuals look beautifull the gameplay is fun i do not suggest that u watch many videos on this game before you play it as it is better expirienced if you dont know whats making the noises or in that cave it is fairly entuative so you dont rly need to anyway
20882,Nice Game. A bit wierd story (About finding parts) but nice. Would recommend to play with friends for sure!
20883,"Excellent game, a few bugs, but it was created by four people so...given that it is incredible."
20884,"This is a very well made survival game. It's difficult, but not to the point where it becomes annoying. For the most part this game runs smoothly, but it does have a few issues. One major issue in terms of gameplay are the trees. There is a setting that will allow the larger log trees to regrow if you don't destroy tree stumps. However, this doesn't seem to work at all, or is much slower than I was led to believe. 

Multiplayer is a fun way of playing, but it's a little glitchy, although not to the point where the game becomes unfun. Some of the achievements don't work in multiplayer unless you're the one hosting the server.

All around, a very good survival/horror game. Definitely worth the money for it."

20903,"The forest is a pretty great game alone but is an entirely new experience with friends. While the game isn't easy it also isn't so hard that you can't progress without getting the old gun or some other non story required items(unless you playing on higher difficulties). When I bought this game I honestly thought it was gonna be a game me and play once but it was a completely different experience, we liked it so much we decided top beast the game on hard survival and get every achievement we can on the way there. Of there nothing without faults and you can find a few glitches and bugs here and there and that would be a problem of ""Sons of the Forest"" wasn't coming out so soon. In the end I would rate this game a solid 8.5-9/10 I would definitely recommend this to anyone looking for a game to play with friends."
20904,"it is a great survival game for playing with friends. If you have ever wanted to play an actually good survival game that has multiplayer features I would advise you to play this game, its really enjoyable to play with friends and if you don't have friends, don't worry! there is a single player mode which is also extremely fun. So if you do get this game, all I have to say is good luck against the mutants."

20920,"The gameplay itself is interesting, but because there are too few items and objects on the map, the game gets boring for me relatively quickly. At some point I just dont feel like doing the same thing over and over again: cutting down trees, eating meat...
And the critters make the game interesting in the first moment, but at some point they are just annoying. Especially when the big critters come and you dont yet effective/heavy weapons tocan kill them. The game is too immature!
Another point of criticism on my part is that the stamina doesnt increase, although that should be logical if you run around in the forest all day. its very annoying when you have to stop again and again to regenerate."

20950,"Chop tree, Chop naked men."
20951,"A great game for a group of friends - I think the value in this comes from the cooperative exploration and survival-based building elements of the game. All of this is drastically enhanced by the sense of fear the game cultivates. 

On a side note, the cave exploring element of this game maybe the best I have experienced in a game. It excels at making one feel claustrophobic and on edge as you travel deeper in the various cave systems.

A great bang for the buck!"

21033,My name is Walter Hartwell White. I live at 308 Negra Arroyo Lane Albuquerque New Mexico 87104. This is my confession
21034,good survival/horror game
21035,"Great idea, but does not follow ‚Äúbest practice‚Äù rules in game-design! 1# the save-system is infuriating, you can only save at camp, which means you can easily lose hours of progress ‚Äúexploring‚Äù the world. 2# since there is no proper tutorial, you often find yourself having spent hours doing ‚Äúthe wrong‚Äù things. 3# its easy to get lost in the caves for hours, then die, and then you spawn back to the last time you saved.  

In summary, if you like loosing hours of progress when gaming, then this is the game you have been waiting for. If you like the feeling of ‚Äúmaking progress‚Äù in games, then this is your nemesis. 
"
21036,"This game is a full blown joke.

That game is written in Unity and even though my GPU isnt the best it still can play gtao at 20 fps but here in the forest its impossible.

The devs dont even care about the forest anymore. I mean yes Im planning on getting a better gpu but cmon, why does your game need like 5tb vram to even get to 2 fps???

The biggest joke however is that this game has so many bugs, I cant use my upgraded stick anymore with cloth, I can go up infintely into the sky using a rope but then when I go down I die bc fall damage. This is more broken than devious licks(!!!)"

Have you ever wondered about the history of gaming, or why people play games in general? And why gaming can be useful? Well, I‚Äôm here to tell you, even if you don‚Äôt care! First of all, Have you ever heard of gaming? Well, of course you have. It‚Äôs been all over the world, for multiple years, almost a century now! Now, for those of you that don‚Äôt know, Gaming is the act of playing a game on your console or your computer, it‚Äôs the activity of playing games. Now, did you know that the first game was made in 1958 by the Physicist William Higinbotham? Yes, It was a very simple tennis game. The game was called Pong, and it was very popular back then, and little bit now. But now, you might be asking, ‚Äú how many people play games? ‚Äú Well, there are currently around 3.07 billion people in the world that play video games! 
Let‚Äôs now talk about why people play video games, and why it can be good in your life. First of all, gaming helps people around the world. It can help cope with people's stress , and some games can just make you really calm, and help you get a better attitude/mood. You can also make money by playing video games, PROFESSIONALLY. You make a lot of money by streaming or winning tournaments/championships. It‚Äôs a win-win because while you are making money, you‚Äôre also having fun. But, you have to get lucky to start making money in games, so it‚Äôs not something easy and it also requires skill, which is why there aren‚Äôt many people that go for playing video games as their main job. For me, playing video games is a hobby, and it‚Äôs really fun with friends. So that‚Äôs why I play video games, as well as it helps me cope with the stress I might have sometimes, or it puts me in a better mood. Now, there are multiple reasons why people play them, but I believe that those are the main reasons.
Now that you know all of that information, you basically know almost everything about gaming, so I‚Äôll just be telling you fun/interesting facts. There are approximately over 5 MILLION video games in the world! That just shows how many games or options there are for you to play.. Did you know that there are 10 main types of video game genres? There is Sandbox Real-time strategy, Shooters (FPS and TPS), Multiplayer online battle arena, Role-playing (RPG, ARPG, and More), Simulation and sports, puzzlers and party games, Action-adventure, Survival and horror, and lastly, Platformer. There are so many genres you can pick to play, which is why gaming is SO popular! Did you know that  Games provide a 23 percent gain over traditional learning? 2013 research shows that games can increase learning outcomes by two grade levels. Playing action video games trains people to make right decisions faster. How, you might ask? Players develop a heightened sense of their surroundings and that helps them multitask. And surgeons that regularly play video games make 37% fewer errors and perform their tasks 27% faster than peers. There are so many benefits of playing video games!
I hope you learned something new from this, and I hope you enjoyed my speech! I just have one last question for you.. What is your favorite video game? Personally my favourite video game is fortnite, I play it all day, and I am champions league!

21093,its fun with your friends i recommend have not had fun on a game in a minute
21094,3 words: Dead Baby Cave
21095,amazing fantastic
21096,"the enimes have big titties huge rly big 
"
21097,Was good for awhile then got kinda repetitive. I did however enjoy eating  naked people.
21098,"If you enjoy games based in building things, fending off enemies that vary in difficulty, and collecting materials and items, then this game is definitely one you should at least try, for $20 it's fairly entertaining, enough so that I have over 100 hours in it and still find it fun to play. 

Story wise, this game is pretty good. I like the lore, and I am saving my pennies for the second one coming out soon. 

The online has potential for griefers, but with a decently large map, it is not too difficult to just move away from them or just even remove them from the server altogether. 

Other than that,
 my only complaints are the low enemy volume, as after a while, I'd really, really love to see groups of like 20-30 cannibals attack my base,
and the boats, because the largest raft with two oars on each side is basically impossible to use by yourself, something it does NOT tell you when crafting it. 

And for some reason, they removed heavier boat building. Which, while I understand, is just disappointing to me. I really enjoyed having a hilarious tiny raft with 5 floors and flights of stairs causing it to lean heavily to the side, while staying row-able. That was a hilariously fun glitch.

Otherwise, this is a good game to play to pass time, and is even funner with friends or even strangers, and I'd recommend grabbing it, if you can on sale, even when the second comes out."
21099,Nobody liked Timmy anyway.
21100,poop!
21101,good game

21106,great game
21107,Felt like a badass killing 8 mutants at once
21108,"The Forest is an incredible survival-horror experience. I highly recommend cooperatively playing with friends and if you have a VR headset, play it in virtual reality - it's surprisingly immersive and doesn't feel gimmicky at all. It feels like this game was made for VR just as much as it was made for playing on desktop. This means that you can play either way and switch out between the two each play session and still have a blast!"
21109,"Cool game
Kinda minecraft, kinda mystery quest 
Main Story reminds me of ""Lost"" in a way

21121,"been playing for less than a week and i have 24hrs of gameplay. all i can say in this game is that it's very good. although there are some bugs that are yet to be fixed, it's still playable even in potato laptops like mine. 

this game is self-paced and won't force you to do the main story. you can just mess around the open-world of the game or build with creative mode, or do the story if you really want to! there's no pressure in this unless you're playing in high difficulty.

overall, i really recommend this game! you can even play it with friends up to 8 players. it will be more fun that way!"
21122,yes
21123,Fantastic Game!
21124,love the way Canibals jumpscares you in the caves

21147,wow
21148,BIG GAME
21149,Great game
21150,pretty good
21151,Spent ages building a rock wall and fortifications. Set up great traps outside. Came back from a hunt to giant enemies spawned inside my camp. It was walled off and surrounded by cerberus-level defences. They wrecked everything. That kind of lazy game design is unacceptable.
21152,"By Far the best multiplayer horror survival game out there right now and i cant wait for the second game to come out. Ive played the full game on both my ps4 and Pc and its most certainly a great and must have game for the price its at. I had lots of fun being chased down by cannibals, jumped scared by babies launching themselves at you, giant legsies and armsies hunting you and exploring the caves for the good loot. Would recommend to get."

21159,"It's a fun game with friends. For me personally I did not care too much on my own, it's just not as fun. But, I play it with my wife and we have a lot of fun! It's a great game to play if you like horror and playing with your partner. :) I highly recommend this game."
21160,"Well I have played 1000 hours so far.
So yes this game is great and there are loads of things to do and make."
21161,"The name of the game speaks itself when you start playing or watching the trailer of the game. You actually experience to survive through forest as survivor. Alone, with friends, online, or family depending on your choice. There are a lot of difficulties and knowledge that you will learn throughout by playing the game.

There are challenges in this game for you to experience through while you are staying over a lot of time, and building a lot of things. The stronger monsters will become. The needs of crafts are very interesting and exciting.

The game is worth to buy, and if you did enjoy the game survivor!"
21162,corpse pinata! :D
21163,"Such a Great survival game ........when you enter into cave and go deeper and deeper and you have lack of resources it's so horrific experience ....... Cannibals acts so real they laugh , scream and runs around you ..............there are lots of weapons hidden in cave ......"
21164,Gotten eaten by cannables the baby from RE Village and a Vagina monster whats not to love
21165,NIce Game but Motion Blur is Annoying
21166,Fun if playing with friends. Really confusing to go around the map even when you've acquired items that help you with it. Story lacks links and the endings aren't really worth all the effort. LOTS of bugs happening around often.
21167,"Love The Forest. If you are new or you're on the fence about buying, I reccomend watching ""Outer Middle Show"", or ""Farket""'s youtube channels. They have a decent amount of gameplay and have honestly made the game fun for me since they teach you the basics that you'll need (as the game does a rather poor job of that, but I think that's the point, as it is a survival game). I have played this game so many times and have so many different saved files (or seasons, as I call them). There really is no wrong way to play and with the second one (Sons of the Forest) right around the corner, you will be glad you bought it."
21168,good
21169,"Awesome game in VR. Tried it a while ago and couldn't play; framerate was so bad, but maybe there was new drivers or update or something, because now it is awesome, and in my top 3 VR games of all time. A good game; a great VR game."

-Gameplay is pretty fun from the start.
-Enemies are not that dumb.
-Visuals are ok. Can be better. It doesn't look like on screenshots in the steam store. (yep i have all on ultra)
-Audio
-Coop
-Crafting is fun?

Cons:
-Building in the game is sort of terrible. There are lots of limitations and odd rotations. Some parts of buildings cannot be repared after enemy destroys it.
-Feels like they added a lot to the game and tried to throw it all together.
-No random generated maps. Kills the idea of replaying.
-Can be a bit buggy and higher difficulties are stupid. Can't really build anything when enemies come every 5 min or less.
-Combat is sort of awkward. Hitboxes are a little odd as well.
-Lag when you enter cave or some part of cave. It looks like the game is loading the location you have entered."

21311,I can do illegal logging
21312,cool
21313,I farted and it stunk and then i completed the game 3 times.
21314,The game is enjoyable although very lite on story and objectives. It was fun to base build and try and survive while constantly under attack. There is a large map to explore although there is very little direction given. I wish the game had more smaller objectives and or things to find. A lot of the time you just find your own objectives or look up what you should be doing late game. There are few to no hints as to where things are and you just need to be very diligent about looking everywhere for things. Was far from perfect but fun nonetheless.

21326,"Hella fun game to play. It's about a million times better when you play with friends. Gameplay wise, there's an endless amount of things you can do in the game (assuming you have the required dedication to cut down the trees you need. Also this game successfully made me shit my pants. Just around the time those ""things"" come out, it's not a pleasant experience. 8/10"
21327,there is a forest in this game
21328,"its good

21336,spooky
21337,weird shit
21338,"Solo and cooperative gameplay feel very different. 

In the former, you're scared, alone, and constantly threatened. Caves, once cleared, are your only true safe zone. You pray that your camp, if you have one, isn't demolished by weird mutants, and that your traps can ensure a safe escape from groups that wander the island. Camouflage is a must.

In cooperative gameplay, you have other people to help build fantastic walls, set traps, build a farm, stock shelves, and revive you in a fight. The game quickly becomes an exciting splunking expedition where your previous dangers have become a resource of bones and skin. The surface is yours to sew and reap. Grab your chainsaws, and have fun!"
21339,"good game



scary if not prepared for example

naked people chase with stick in hand

21343,good game
21344,This game is really fun and a blast with friends
21345,good like mc
21346,"So, what you need to do is:
Open the Game
Play it
Shift + Tab to pull up steam overlay
Click 'web browser' 
Go to The Forest Wiki

Not that it's bad, but caves are hard to navigate and have required items to end the game with. It's great"
21347,a banger with friends
21348,"It's definitely 'a' forest, but I don't know if it's 'the' forest. But it's an island I definitely wouldn't want to visit in my lifetime."

21352,"AWESOME survival game. I know it says I've only played for 1 hour but that's because I have almost 100 hours logged on my PlayStation and I enjoyed it so much I bought it AGAIN almost immediately after getting my PC to experience it with even better visuals and with other friends! The crafting element is really cool and easy to use once you do it a couple times and the base building offers a lot of variety. The overall story is fantastic and I was blown away by where the story takes you if you follow it. But it's equally as fun just as a sandbox survival game, no following story nmecessary. I'm STILL discovering new things to do. Morbid and wild enemies/environment constantly giving me scares and jumps that evolve as you play. Imagine a truly terrifying horror Minecraft with real world graphics and an actual story. Single player or multiplayer, if that sounds like you're thing, you're missing out if you haven't played this."
21353,Where my Timi?
21354,A cannibal walked up to me and
21355,Good survival game
21356,great game I played it for hours its just a little bit scary
21357,"I would suck a cock if that means playing the sequel earlier

I am not joking"
21358,goood
21359,bats- too scary
21360,"Played this for over 2500 hours on ps4 and this game never gets old for me, the amount of fun after completing the game and before is the best. The first time i played with friends it was the most fun we all have had since games went to shit."
21361,aweesome
21362,"Would be good if it wasn't absolutely full of bugs and glitches. Prepare for items to disappear from your inventory even if you saved and never be available in the world again.

Honestly, it's not even a finished game."
21363,sandbox
21364,scary cannibal bad but game good

21380,"Great game. Needs some polishing and maybe a better starting options such as a character customization (height,speed,strenght) and maybe a different inventory system. Otherwise really nice!"

21382,"it is the best game ive ever played and thaTS SAYING SOMETHING
"
21383,"It is hard to get a good start with this game. Nature is harsh and the local population is trying to kill you every chance they got. But when you finally survive a few nights and know how to get water and food, the game really kicks in and lets you feel survival at its best. Good story too!"
21384,"Good game, play with your friends for maximum experience."

21386,I am now a really fat kid (no life btw) and I forgot what grass feels like all because of this game. I wish they would add intimate action with the zombie men. 10 of my hours were spent with my right hand doing its own thing. Ari Gato.
21387,good gam with friends get it
21388,"Great Game, Great Scares Sequel Coming"
21389,"Its a good game with a decent amount of Playtime, it has some elements of crafting and base building however after the first 4 hours, you have almost seen all there is it, there are some Equipment's that could introduce new recipes but they are kinda limited, you have about 10 enemy variety ( including same npc's with extra equipment or more health ), and there are unique monsters in addition to that, the game is a bit disorienting in the sense that you could sometimes just lose your way or cant find the next cave to explore for hours. All and all it is still a fun game to ply but i would not suggest anyone to play it solo, buy it with friends because that's where you can have the most amount of fun with it ."
21390,Insane gameplay. You can get a lot of hours in if you do not use the wiki. You get use to the cannibals and the game gets less scary the more you play. To a point where it's not scary at all. Really emotional ending and can't wait for the second game. 9/10 just cause I wish it could stay as scary as its start.

21409,"An interesting game with an interesting plot. Playing alone seems pretty boring to me, but when your friend joins the game, everything falls into place.

Of course, there are bugs here, but these bugs are closed by the construction of the game. It seems to me that a lot has been invested in this game, and there are also mysteries.

I‚Äôve put a little time in survival games but never have played a game like this. The enemies are so unpredictable, it‚Äôs creepy! Would definitely recommend having a friend or 2 to play with.

The VR mode is so fluid and enjoyable, normally VR seems tacked on to the end of most games but The Forest seems as if it was designed for VR from the start. So great!"

21668,"Extremely enjoyable and, for me anyway, challenging game. There's a learning curve to it as there's no tutorial, so if you like or need your hand held to play a game this isn't for you. There's a wealth of guides here on STEAM, its own wiki, the web, and YouTube however to help get you started.

If you like survival games, base building, naked mutant cannibals, or airplanes then I highly recommend this game. I also recommend trying out multiplayer with either your friends, family, or both."

21674,"This game was OK at the very best, but the fact that this is a full release makes it feel very empty. This is essentially an early access game, as you will find 99.99% of the map being more or less barren. If you disagree, search a map up online. There isn't much to do besides caving, in which you can finish the game extremely fast. The atmosphere was it's best point, and it did a pretty good job at that."
21675,"its pretty mid, the story is lacking and the map is barren. could be more fun if there was more to do other than find timmy"

21720,This game is very fun to play with friends. The crafting is decent and easy to understand. The storyline is fun but can get tiring after multiple plays.
21721,"So much to do, but will they give you enough time before it turns dark?"
21722,"Very great game! loved playing it with my friend's as it is a survival game. there are many different items to get like a flashlight, katana, chainsaw, climbing tools and many more. it was a fun experience and the building is great! you can build defenses for you and your friends. in this game there are cannibals to fight off and be wear because on day 7 you might see mutants which are very strong and can hit you very hard. although the crafting system is a little hard you can just google it! you'll also need a beefy computer and if you don't then just turn down the graphics in the settings menu. anyways this game is fun and you should probably buy it if you have a beefy computer."
21723,great yet challenging game
21724,"Maybe this game is fun with friends, but its sucks solo. Really disappointed in this, maybe due to all the hype around it. Happy that I at least bought this as a game key for 5$... it still feels like a waste of money though.

Graphics are ugly as hell... like 2010 ugly. Doesnt look like the screenshots on the store... fake? Idk, this is not how the game looks.

So far multiple game mechanics are lame af. Game tells that you are ""thirsty. find clear water"". Looks a small river that is HIGHER than ocean level and has completely CLEAR water. Can't drink from it. In fact I am yet to find any river or pond that I can drink from. Can't even fill up a pot and boil it over the fire. This in a survival game no less. 

Talking about fire, I built a tiny ""basic"" campfire and accidentally stepped my foot a bit into it for a very short while... burned to death within seconds. Somehow woke up in a cave hanging from cealing after burning to death.

I will play this with my kids and see if we have great fun. If we do I might update the review for recommendation, but for now this feels lame."
21725,Eat cannibal very fun (would recommend)
21726,I think this is a very good game you should cop it
21727,"Amazing !

Seriously half the people including myself initially don't understand this game. Anyone who claims there isn't enough crafting is wrong , as after 55 days in im still finding cool stuff from a secret evil church to a full on glider. It's not minecraft but once you finish it you'll get that mode which is cool. Or the horde mode that's crazy. Because its not Ark it actually works and works well which means it's a scary horror story which has two endgames based on choices.

The optimisation isn't great and there's a few glitches but nothing bad considering how much is going on.
The music is none existent outside of musical tapes but the sound is terrifying ..truly scary.
The gameplay is high mearning curve and finickity at times bur plenty of options.
Lastability is months or years as every time you play its different with random starts and locations and new updates. No microtransactions at all.

The combat isnt destiny but its brutal and fast with awesome weapons.
Overall the attention to detail is spectacular with many stories told through the environment as much as the lore through collectibles.
The multiplayer is a little buggy but amazing fun and an entirely different experience.
So i'd say buy it as it's cheap and play it and dont give up.
Use your second device as a game support tool as there are interactive map apps. And the wiki is cool though don't spoil many of the brilliant secrets and surprises.

I've played games for 20 plus years on all formats and across every genre and i was amazed to find it is one of the best game experiences i've every played and beyond value for money. Give it a chance and you won't be disappointed."
21728,"great game
"
21729,"It's the most real-feeling survival game I have ever played.  Very tense.  It is also the scariest game I have ever played.  If you are going to play it single player, I recommend doing a play-through on Peaceful mode first, to learn the game mechanics because it is not very intuitive.  The tutorials are not very helpful.  You will most likely be Googling a lot, at first.  Also, it involves a LOT of caving, and the caves are so dark you  can barely see your hand in front of your face.  They are also like mazes.  You will most likely get lost a lot and finish up highly frustrated.  Learning HOW to craft items, what items can be crafted, and what they do is very important to your survival, and it is a lot easier to learn on Peaceful mode.  Then you can also learn HOW to build, and a bit about the map because the map provided is not very helpful, plus you can learn many other things such as how to build.  Once you know the game mechanics, this game is highly addictive because it is a lot of fun.  Really a blast on multi-player."

21907,i hate cannibals so much
21908,Good game building and blue prints need fixing up but with friends thats were the game shines
21909,"Loading in for the first time with a friend, this game had a lot of potential. Encountering the enemies for the first time was exciting. Discovering our first cave. Building our first base. After about 3 hours or so, however, the game very quickly loses all of its charm. The jank of this game becomes extremely apparent.

Combat, for example, is incredibly shallow. Bows deal little damage, and take an absurd amount of arrows to kill the simplest of enemies. Clubs and axes simply boil down to mashing attack and stun-locking your enemies.

Zero replayability. Everything on the map is the same every playthrough with the exception of the spawn point. Once you've experienced all the caves and the ending, that's it.

A majority of the buildable things in-game are pointless. You can survive with a basic fire and shelter and that's it. The rest is a waste of time, especially since enemies can destroy them anyways. My friend and I took  roughly 30 minutes to build a log cabin, only for it to be destroyed a couple nights later. 60+ logs worth of time and effort just gone.

Unfortunately I had lost substantial progress on a character playing w/ friends, not knowing that the save function was mandatory in MP. Kind of ridiculous that the host saving doesn't save for everybody... and sleeping doesn't save either? Specifically making a manual save is required regardless of SP or MP. You can chalk that up to being a mistake on my part, but still...

And finally, once you reach a certain point it feels like a guide or walkthrough is mandatory to complete the game. There are a about 10 or so caves scattered throughout the island and multiple points of interest, some of which are incredibly hidden and unlikely to be found by natural means. If you don't look up the necessary caves and items you will wastes tens of hours looking for things you don't even necessarily know about.

Overall kind of a generic survival/crafting game with little replayability and an endless ocean of jankiness and obtuseness. I would suggest not wasting your time."
21910,"Amazing game with friends, worth the purchase."
21911,I have really enjoyed this game with family and friends. We play on hard and hard survival along with setting up camps in high native areas to make things interesting.
21912,"It's has lots of bugs but nothing feels game breaking, lots of fun alone or with a friend, story is really thin but it helps with the mystery, doesn't hold your hand for a lot of things, overall it's a great experience even in 2022.

On a side note: Having to draw out the cave maps on a piece of paper outside the game was a lot of fun."

22055,"Even though there is a sequel coming out very soon called ""Sons of The Forest"", this game is still a classic and fun. It would be more fun if you had a group of friends to play with, the game is beatable even with friends by your side. The horror factor is still there, sometimes you get jumped by mutants or by cannibals. The fear is unwavering even at night, because you'll never know what's behind you. The thing I like about this game is cave exploration, so many lore to uncover. I've recently beaten the game with friends, and I'll tell you: It was so fun and satisfying, but there is no replay factor unfortunately. After you beat the game, you're left with nothing but to fuck around with developer mode. Still, get this game on sale."

22098,"This game is absurd. On normal mode, which is the EASIEST of the 3 difficulties, is unbalanced and overly difficult. It spawned DIRECTLY IN FRONT OF ME, TWO ARMSY'S. Not to mention, the enemies are overpowered! It takes 10 spear stabs to kill Regular Cannibals, and they hit me WITH BARE HANDS, and in THREE HITS, I'm dead??? Also, they can DODGE and I CAN'T?! RIDICULOUS! The weak spear, which has half the damage of the upgraded spear takes TWO THROWS to kill a Cannibal. But the upgraded spear? TEN STABS?! I tested it and the weak spear being thrown does as much damage as DYNAMITE!!! The game is still bugged too! A deer SLID off of a mountain and got stuck SIDEWAYS on the side of it! A bird was just sitting in mid-air! Not on a tree branch, mind you. IN THE MIDDLE OF THE AIR. A bench fell through the wall of a building. Just went straight through it. Then, despawned, respawning back up inside the building, proceeding to fall again. Rabbit was just in the water, running around on the bottom of the pond. I threw my spear, and it left the dimension. I could not find it, it completely despawned. Pulling up the crafting screen lets the world audio keep playing even though the world is paused. Suitcases and objects FLY in the air without even being touched! I ate a blueberry and it HURT ME?! Passengers bring powered tools, but NO WATER?! Only alcohol?! This game needs SO MUCH fixing and the normal difficulty NEEDS DESPERATELY to be decreased before this becomes #1 on the Rage Games list!"

This is the second time I've tried it as originally there was issues with physical crouching, which now seems to have been partially addressed but there are still times where you find the camera moving away from you when you move toward it, which is very jarring.

Also the controls aren't clear and there seems to be no actual tutorial, or if there is I wasn't shown it by default.  Anyway, will try again some time, but from my experiences so far I don't recommend for VR."

Some of the mechanics in the game, such as athleticism for your character, are pretty much useless as well as some of the weapon ""upgrades."" Combat can be comedic at times, and it's certainly not super polished. Hopefully the sequel fleshes stuff out more, but for $7 I had a ton of fun and enjoyed a surprisingly interesting story.

And its really fun to experience with friends since you all can team up and beat the game, And there are also different modes on what difficulty you want to play, Which i appreciate since you can play in a peaceful world first to get used to the controls! <33 sorry for the long rewiew!"

22152,nice
22153,"Pretty fun in multiplayer with 3 friends! I'd recommend not googling anything until maybe 10 hours in and then only googling a map so you can point yourself in the direction of new things, but try to avoid googling other than that. We got about 20 hours of fun out of it, you can get a lot more if chopping down trees and building a huge base is your jam, but you don't need to at all. We mostly just built tiny shacks to sleep in as we ran around."

22177,"what a trash fire of a game. It takes hours to do anything to the point of boredom but you have to do it fast so you don't die from the awkward enemies. Oh and if you want to pack up the resources you have acquired that is not an option because breaking down constructed items and buildings just deletes all the items you spent so long gathering. Oh but I should play more so I can get good at the game and get better equipment right? nope.... the ""boats"" you can make have steering that is nearly nonexistent and the armor and improved weapons you can work your way up to making barely feel impactful or worth the effort. I hope this game improves, but I have little faith after its long development cycle so far."

22277,"This game saved my life.

I am 27.

My ex-wife and I have a daughter together, and adopted our son together. They are now both 4 years old.

When we were going through our separation, I found myself super turned on and moist. I was fapping like a maniac. I got so mad one day from everything spiraling out of my control that I fisted my rear end in a moment of overwhelming emotion. That caused me to break my 5th metacarpal in my right hand... my master baiting hand... my games hand.. the hand that I held and carried my box of tissues and soap to bed with.. The hand I desperately needed to make sure I could continue to satisfy myself. 

After learning of the severity of my self-inflicted fisting damage, I was borderline suicidal. Keep in mind that just a few months before this, I was the happiest man with no history of depression or anxiety. I have never had fisting of rage, or been one to break down a butt and cry, but I was in a low spot that just really buried me from being able to see the light on the other side.

Having nothing better to do, I searched for a game I could play, ONE HANDED while my butt's recovered. I somehow stumbled upon this game and read some of the reviews. I decided that it had to be worth a shot... I must admit, I didn't beat the game, or play nearly as long as some of you. In fact, I may have only played this game a day or two.. With that being said, after doing so, I had a new found joy and hope for life. I was able to put behind me the pain and suffering that had been cast over me. I was able to experience other peoples joy and happiness. I was able to see the fruits of my ""fisting"". I relaxed for 5 ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•ing minutes to this music long enough to realize that I was going to be okay.

After coming to that realization, I turned the game off, and I went back to fisting. It hurt my hand like hell but I was motivated. I stopped feeling so damn sorry for myself, and I became the butt fister I needed to be in that moment, not the weak ioncel boy I was behaving as.

Today, I am close friend with my kids mother. We don't fight, or argue, or say hurtful things to each other. We are parents, and fisting friends.

I now have 3 kids. My third child is, wait for it, ALSO 4 YEARS OLD. The woman I am with was going through a very similar situation at the time of my own separation, and we just stumbled in to each others rear end unexpectedly. We have been in a relationship for a year now, and are very happy together.

Moral of the story, you never know what life holds in store for you, and if I would have given up when all the odds were stacked against me, I wouldn't be where I am today. This silly little game helped me realize that.

Thank you"

Such a good game but it¬¥s too buggy, the fact that it¬¥s not an easy game and it will continue changing my Bone Arrows to regular arrows pisses me off, is a waste of time to collect resources just for a  building to pop-out without any reason, arrows switching from advanced to their regular wood arrows , so far those are my complains and I wasted too much time collecting and building for the game just for it to suddenly decide my tree house is not valid ,right when I¬¥m about to finish it .

I say this as someone who loves open world survival.
The base building leaves much to be desired. Some of the objects you can place are cool, however I feel the requirements and grinding needed to build anything remotely useful is a bit much. 

Plus, there's no real need to build a base as you can complete this game without anything at-all.

Once you've completed the crazy story, the game feels a little repetitive and pointless.

But, it takes everything that I love from survival games and presents us with a solid experience. On top of that the story is really intriguing. It keeps me wanting to play for hours on end.

22410,"Great games, i enjoy it"
22411,"It starts off great me and a single friend, with a plan for this large screw off base. We're running out of trees in walking distance to cut, so it's a must to create a wooden cart to haul wood in. Well cart #1 ends up capsized in the river, never to be touched again. Then comes along cart #2, it did its job for a while. That was until it hits a stump, sending it into the 9 circles of Hell. As you watched cart #2 travel to the center of the Earth it's suddenly shot into sky, and was now falling from the sky like something out of Chicken Little. This stayed like this for the entirety of the game play, you'd watch the cart fall from the sky, through the ground, to the center of the Earth and repeat. This is where the fun begins as two more friends join the server. One a goofball, not wanting to actually build a base, but instead creates a raft. A raft that would keep him away from the cannibals but also make him ""the captain"". But this is not just any old raft, he puts a shack on it. From the cliff of our base you see this floating shack, which was glitchy as all hell. He was on a mission to sail around the island on his new raft, but little did he know, that he would give himself a plethora of new name tags. So when you did a 360, you'd see at least 7 copies of his usernames. But what makes it more fun, is that you'd also randomly find multiple shacks around the ocean as it glitched more into the game."

22418,"I'm a big chicken when it comes to horror games.

...But this one's got a spot for people like me too. You can turn all the baddies off for a purely survival gameplay experience, which I thought was great. My online friends and I discovered how well this game does with the scares. By far, the most brilliant trick this game did is some optical illusions with lighting and level of detail that keeps you on your toes. The story arc is great, and it really feels like a discovery the whole time.

What I'd change: I don't like killing sea turtles or sharks, neither creature deserves it. I wish survival wasn't so easy to brush off, mid-game survival gear makes it trivial. A few more survival mechanics (more intense cold, sanity maybe, illness), and I feel like the local, um... residents... obliterate your structures without much thought, a log wall seems to only slightly slow them down.

Worth the play, but this game could definitely benefit from a little more depth and tuning."

22437,worst game but i love it
22438,played this game with 2 friends and restarted 4 times because we got softlocked in caves that we couldn't get out of. the game without a guide is bullshit because your fucking lost for most of it and you could wander into a cave that you have no way of getting out of. after 17 hours me and my friends finally got to the end and we killed timmy because fuck timmy and the ending was really good like letting go of past memorys or some shit but then we watched the good ending and we were all disappointed by just how it should have ended with timmy mutating in front of the crowd and killing them leading into the second game but no hes alive and mutated years later. besides that its alright i guess

While up there I noticed a ship wreck just off the coast and before heading down the hill to explore it, I took a moment to appreciate the tranquility and peace I found being out of the forest of cannibals and various other dangers lurking among the trees, only to turn around to leave and see three of them absolutely sprinting full speed towards me from 20 feet away. I screamed, panic quit the game, and have been too scared to go back. 10/10"

22655,"Wish they had a mixed review option. This is one of the most fun games to play on regular PC. But as a VR experience, its absolutely terrible. As far as im aware, you can't communicate through Discord and play PCVR at the same time. Therefore, the Walkie Talkie feature is the absolute worst feature in the world. The fact that I have to use a walkie talkie when my friend is 10 inches away, makes zero sense and ruins the immersion.
I also had a major problem trying to connect and play with my friends in VR. When we're on computer, no issue, but VR seems to be a hassle whether it be not actually joining the game, or lag thats unfathomable. Just a rough experience all around. 

Recommended for PC not for VR."

22679,good
22680,"- Boring. 

Despite having random spawn points, the game is too linear and you'll end up going to the same caves in the same order each save/world.

- Building is lack luster and time consuming, for example a log cabin takes 80+ logs. Want to build a castle? Good luck.

- Easy to cheat, takes the fun out of it.
You can dupe arrows accidentally just by trying give them away! or dupe logs just by your friend picking them up too fast while using a log sled.

- Hackers. And hacks are easy to get!

- Short story; no lore. Which leaves the game being a day and night simulator.

There are in-game structures which are indestructible; this makes using them a no brainer, after awhile cannibals are no longer a threat or much less of a threat. Your base regardless is ONLY used for: extra storage, cooking and sleeping. So... if your base does get overrun, it doesn't matter anyway. Who cares? Not me."

22685,"playing a game has never been so disappointing. They should literally pay you to play this terrible game. Let me give you an example of some of the blasphemy that occurred in this game. My friend were playing this game trying to have a fun time like any other survival game little did I know the imbecile degenerate monkeys looking fellows in this game were racist. you see I have hispanic genes. And when we split up to build bases, I was being attacked constantly, I didnt have a second of breathing time. I would either kill them or die come back and then instantly die again all whilst my friend was having a great time in hoo loo lala land acting completely immature ungrateful . Profane I must say but sough cough thats beside the poitn. he was not attacked a single time. What is the meaning of this?? this game sucks dont buy it if you actually enjoy having a life. Youd be better off going and Playing a visual novel about having sex with no real plot. Yes one that is literally just fan service. The most hopenfluer and least fun games to play. This is the first game I have ever left a review on and I actually hate this game with a passion. I would kindly rather watch paint dry"
22686,"Good Day,
                I am writing this review in hopes that anybody seeing it will realize how actually ass this game is. I have 10 hours in it so far and i have accomplished nothing. Now, this could be because of my immense lack of skill, but being a sigma male, I am going to further shit on this game to make myself feel better. The developers have put more time into this game than i have been alive, and it still looks like dog crap. I open the game, choose my viewing settings, and am immediately faced with the most horrendous, piece of shit game that I have ever laid my extremely masculine eyes upon.

I just got Covid and saw that The Sons of The Forest was coming out and it looked really good so I thought ""Why not beat the first one before TSOTF comes out"".

Boy did I have a diamond of a game just sitting for years. 

The forest is a hardcore mutant like survival where you're stranded on an island and have to freely explore to unlock the story. It is challenging enough to make you think, but not hard to where its no fun or you feel like you're not making progress. There are useful items scattered throughout the map and throughout caves that will definitely help you. I cannot lie I did have to take to youtube at some points to find items/ make sure I'm going the right way through the final cave, but I was able to do so without spoiling anything major. The ENTIRE ending is absolutely phenomenal. You go through a certain door and its like the entire game changed and it gives an amazing wow factor and feeling. You are left with 2 choices, two different endings. I personally activated the button and really enjoyed that ending. (trying not to spoil anything but also share my thoughts on the ending I chose) it is a very good twist and leaves you ready for the next game. 

Took me a good 5 days of playing to beat it, maybe 5-8 hours everyday. 

Definitely worth my time and money and I will be counting the days till the next game!

9.5/10. Great game!"

22716,"Controls hardly work in Rift S, the game is NOT friendly to new players. The Survival Book is absolutely garbage, the only thing this game does to new players is just scare them with ooga booga cavemen running around, we spawn in with low hunger and we can't even catch rabbits. I regret not refunding this like a year ago, because this is the worst VR game so far that i have played, please remove your VR feature or just rework it because it looks like your janitor that has a broken vr headset programmed the VR feature."

22727,Fun for $7 to play with a buddy and learn the game together. Just scratching the surface but would recommend to others if looking for random game to casual play. Seems like could be played solo also and be just fine. At very beginning stages of the game though.
22728,Good game.
22729,Saving the child was definitely more hassle than its worth (he is bald and does not contribute to the economy). He is destined to work at a kebab shop.

22744,"Very fun game to play with friends, i did get a few spooks out of this game as well the combat is fine nothing really interesting just block and hit but it feels good and works for this game the survival aspects are fun there's eating, drinking you can get infected, cold go insane, building huge bases combining stuff to make cool weapons or upgrade your standard weapon the story is there its not that big just trying to find your son timmy the world looks beautiful the caves are amazing only thing is a bit to dark which can be annoying sometimes because the flash light is really bad also playing with friends can really fuck the fps and cause alot of frame drop so that kinda sucks but its still playable

22802,"- can't drop items
- deers have no bones (only the human enemies?)
- combining some things are tedious (backpack for equipment slots, metal trays to hand over raw ingredients)
- can only drink on edge of lake
- burning bodies get bones but not chopping/skinning
- carrying a corpse does not mean you can place it on fires. You have to do that from your inventory
- some edible food you can eat straight away, others you have to put them in your inventory first then eat from there
- if you're ill, just die and you get cured
- dead enemies falling on top of players delete the rucksack
- some raw resources are available to everyone, some are not
- can't combine meat armour even though it's on the mat
- didn't get cold and wet after swimming in cave water
- water's SO loud
- can't drop climbing axe
- drinking water from fire
- crafting arrows 29/30 + 5 = 30
- when you put down food on racks it places the down the ready to eat food before the raw food
- can't tell what's dry and what's not on the drying racks
- right click to unequip for some items, equip another item in the same slot in other cases
- lighting flares is right click, lighting dynamite is L
- hovering over inventory makes a loud sound for everyone even if they're miles away
- can't interact with the white tents (bigger) but can with the orange tents (smaller)

22961,Fun the first time you play it but its not very replayable.
22962,"basically, this game has 3 core pillars, building, combat, and exploration, if your planning to play this game for 100-150 hours or less and you don""t like building or being creative this will be one of those games you love for those 100 hours but after that it will sit in your library and will only come back with a friend or nostalgia, why? its not that they suck you just adapt to well to them and it feels the same, the world is the same every playthough and once you know the map you bassically get the most op stuff in 2-3 days, combat is really immersive at first but once you know how to use a bow, all headshots are 1 shots except mutants, and once your used to mutants and how they work, all you have to do is litterally throw a spear at them 5 times...... you craft a spear with 2 sticks yeah its easy once your used to it, building is the main focus when you have enough hours because it has many features to help you build your dream cabin, the first 100 hours are unforgetable and better to play with a friend, but if you want a game to play past 100-150 hours unless your a builder, i will say this you need ranged weapons for the final boss melee is suicide"

22972,"Well optimized, atmospheric, mysterious, and immersive AF. Definitely pretty scary too. Suffers from some design flaws, oversights, and poor choices, though, but nothing game-breaking, more like just frustrating and tedious. Only being able to get water from specific ponds, for example, is pretty dumb. The game excels in its single-player story mode. While co-op is certainly fun, it often feels like an afterthought, which is a damn shame. The client-side synchronization for the players is pretty abysmal and there are some DUHH co-op features missing, like being able to give important items to your bros or trade between inventories. Overall, the game punches well above its price category and I highly recommend it, especially on sale. As I'm writing this, the game costs less than 6 euros, which is simply amazing.

Perhaps what I love the most about this game is that it has that arc where you can go from a weakling to your enemy's worst nightmare. The fact that you can become a worse cannibal and monster than the cannibals and monsters stalking you is quite the gruesome power trip. Decorating your fortress with the impaled heads and skulls of the savages is the very essence of this game's soul."

23016,I like that the game doesn't hold your hand but it can be a little frustrating to pick up as a new player from lack of information of basic gameplay mechanics. Its designed around the player themselves being curious and checking the menus out to see what they need to do but it can be easy to get confused. still this is a minor gripe and a quick google can set you stright

23028,Survival game that has some horror mixed in. Caves will scare you most of the time. Joining random lobbies isn't the wise decision since some of the community is toxic.

There are multiple endings to this game and it depends on you to choose. I have never screamed so much playing a game. The 2nd part will be released soon, and that also looks promising."

23137,"This review will contain minor spoilers.

Like many Early Access games of its type, The Forest had a tremendous amount of potential.
It's very clear that the developers had a ton of ideas just as it's equally clear that they lacked the time or manpower to execute on many of them.
In a word, The Forest feels unfinished. It's genuinely impressive for the first couple of hours, but its many issues become glaringly obvious the longer you play.

The game is filled with half-baked systems which are at best baffling and at worst a waste of time. A few of these include:
-Sanity
-Weapon upgrades
-Sleep
-Weight
-Crafting in general (many items have only a single use)

Even basebuilding, which obviously had a lot of work poured into it, is ultimately pointless since the optimal way to play the game is running around the island and building temporary shelters every night. There's no crafting bench which grants access to more recipes and there's no reason to have stationary storage since materials are so plentiful and your character can already carry around so many. The game features a slew of traps which can be used to defend your base, but in my 11-hour playthrough, I never once even considered building them as there's just no point.

The story, for all the praise people give it, feels shoehorned in. A lot of what you encounter makes no sense in-universe. As an example, towards the end of the game you are required to have a keycard to progress. Right before the checkpoint to use said keycard, there's a photo on the ground of a dead body with the keycard in its hand. The photo has the word ""keycard"" written on it with an arrow pointing to the corpse's hand. The game is FILLED with moments like this.

Beyond that, the game feels generally unpolished.
-The level design is extremely amateurish and immersion-breaking.
-Once you get the katana, combat becomes trivial.
-The animal AI is hilariously bad.
-There are a number of bugs, one of which forced me to reset to an earlier save.
-Inventory management is UNBELIEVABLY clunky. I cannot stress this enough.
-General menu navigation is a chore (at least when playing with a controller)
-Audio balancing issues throughout the game (especially noticeable in the final cutscene)

I could go on but I think the above should give you an idea of what the game is like. The fact that the reviews are Overwhelmingly Positive is baffling to me. The Forest feels very much like an Early Access game which needed way more work to be considered complete.

The game is not all bad. The mutants are well executed, the cannibal AI is very impressive, and some moments genuinely spooked me, but the luster wears off quickly.

Never in my life has my opinion of a game gone from extremely positive to abjectly negative so quickly.
In short, give this game a pass."

23172,good game
23173,Great game :)
23174,fun and dont ask more
23175,BEST GAME!
23176,"To start with the strong point: Ambience is really good. Few games are unsettling even after you see the monsters a few times but this one manages to be creepy for as long as I played. 

That's where it ends. I started playing blind on hard with a friend. Here's what I found by the time we decided to drop the game.

The food/thirst system is basically meaningless. You can overcome those issues within a day or two in game. Find a few sea turtles or tortoises and you've got water for the rest of the game. Birds are literally everywhere and make getting food absurdly easy. Every area you explore is full of literal snacks which restore plenty of hunger even if you go in ill-equipped.

The combat ranges from decent at best to boring and gimmicky most of the time. Facing every powerful enemy in the game is like ""Let's pick them apart from range with ranged weapons that feel terrible to aim and run until they retreat to shoot them again""

Worse there is no tech-tree. There are a few crappy items you can make, and then a handful of other items you can find in caves. The game doesn't really feel like you progress at all. It just felt so pointless. 

The only thing you can do is go around and explore caves to find some decent loot, cheese OP abominations and repeat. 

No XP system. No tech progression. An extremely basic stats system, and the ability to occasionally glitch through the floor and fall forever. (which was the last straw for us.)

I don't understand all the positivity. Y'all ever play other survival crafting games? They're better."

23179,Great multiplayer game. Solos too but i got it to play with friends and its a great survival game.
23180,"Strung up some naked people and proceded to beat them with a pointy stick till they dropped their cavity filled teeth.  My absolute favourite thing to do on Sundays, and now I can now do all the time without having to hide the bodies after and spend time in custody because I looked seemed to be the main suspect.  Or that's what I would say if my lawyer had told me not to say that"
23181,"Single player is fun, but multiplayer is a##. Not everyone is a nice person but nothing can be done. sometime you just got to go in alone."

23183,This game is bad ass played it in 2014 and loved it and now just started replaying it and its improved so much. Can't wait for sons of the forest.
23184,"yes, buy it
"
23185,"Great game, I love it"
23186,love how intense it gets and fun it is playing with a friend
23187,It's good!
23188,"I had played this game for a while and thought the horror aspect was almost non-existent, like yeah cannibal guy screams from behind you in the pitch black woods, that can make you jump. But recently I made the mistake of dying which gets you an animation of you being dragged by two of the cannibals, the horrors that exist in that cave are the reason I leave this review, holy shit. Traversing that cave is scarier that any horror game I've ever played. 10/10"

23201,its ok i guess.
23202,"poop and shit on the funny people

23203,"Really good game to play with friends and it takes a while to complete so you have to grind alot,
I like it so much that i will buy the next Forest game 'The sons of the forest' which will release  on may 20th 
2022. Note : trailer is out already."

23206,"i cut tree turn around get jumped by naked men i enjoy
"
23207,Naked people trying to eat you
23208,Nice game. Fun with friends.
23209,"I have never played this game by myself and don't think I'd ever be able to; it's way too scary loll. Instead I played with 3 other friends and we all had a blast, making fun of the gremlins and even starting a band?!?!!! The survivalist aspect was pretty difficult but the grind was fun, knowing that at any moment you could die from thirst or hunger while also trying to fend off the gremlins.

The storyline was unique and interesting, and the game had fun ways of pushing you into wildly horrific circumstances which could easily chill you to the bone and make you want to crawl into a corner and pass away, even with friends to help eachother, which is what really sells this game for me. The stress and fear may difficult to live with in the moment, but the absolute GREATEST part about this game is when you're done killing gremlins, done with a cave or done with swimming and you have that awkward & chilling moment of peace before jumping back into the game.

The graphics were amazing for a game that runs really well on my less than adequate PC, with the wildlife always bringing you joy even when you had to kill animals to drink water and slide down mountains (which was easily one of the most fun parts of the game)."

23216,"I am currently playing and enjoying the game for the most part. A lot of details were added and I can see room for future growth. From the moment the plane crashed I found it next to impossible to believe that there was no one else nearby that survived. Unless it was similar to Cast Away and you made a Soccer Ball into a friend, someone else should have been with the playable character or at least an option to be completely solo or not would have been amazing. I found playing with completely no friendly NPCs made the game hopeless giving no inspiration to carry-on seeking others.  Besides some of the things I listed below I still want to complete the game and see what else is in store. I know I have less Pros than Cons listed but the game is still good overall.

Pros:
Nice open world.
Enemies were scary and unpredictable. 
Teaches good critical thinking in regards to survival skills.


Cons:
The build options would benefit greatly if it had more to offer. (Unless it does overtime and I have not progressed enough) 
VR made it impossible to complete certain tasks. (I died trying to light a fire after 15 minutes because it would not light for nothing)
Ability to save in game would have been helpful to save even while in a cave in case you needed to fins a stopping point for the day/night.
I was stuck in a cave with absolutely no way of understanding how to exit and came close to stop playing altogether.
More detailed guide of what to do and or where to go.
No ability to climb small rocks that was right by my base that the enemies could scale with no effort.
Another thing that I was most sad by was that no other passengers or NPCs were able to help me build a stable, secure place to build a base and gather food, water and other things like wood. That would have made for a really enjoyment, causing players to play solo while also being tasked with keeping the found NPCs alive and working together to complete the game. 

(Don't want to spoil anything and my sincerest apologies if I have already)"
23217,this game is the best
23218,Good enough to have Fun
23219,"OLD BUT GOLD

When u play it for the first time u gonna sh!t urself Fr
this game is unforgiving for beginners"
23220,"This is an amazing survival game, if you have friends playing with you.

Highly recommended, 10/10!  :)))

"
23221,"i got exactly the same experience as going into the forest behind my house, not sure what the hype is about"
23222,"In my opinion, the game is great but there is a lot of annoying features that makes the game unbearable.
- Inventory system is the worst, can't even find what I'm looking at and can't even change their places. There is no need for such a complicated system, it should have been more simple. Imagine you are crafting something new and you cant find it.
- When you want to build a building or such things, you have to use a book that contains them. The book has a lot of pages and when you want to build a specific thing, you have to look for it through the pages or memorize the page. Page tabs are not clear so you have to look at pages for a while.
- You will find the map ahead of the game and it's possible that you may never find it. Even if you find the map it's just a piece of blank paper that draw on it as you travel around. It's ridiculous and unnecessary, you could have just given the blank paper at the start of the game. Absolutely bad choice.
Overall the game is actually fun and scary, even more fun when you play with your friends. You get used to these annoying features but I do not recommend the game."
23223,"i love this game
"
23224,"An FPS solo/multiplayer survival game with an interesting and simple story. You and your friends have to survive on an island full of cannibals, with a goal to rescue your son who has been stolen by one of them.

A great game for survival fans with a faint touch of horror game, the game has 5 different difficulties (creative, peaceful, normal, hard, and hard survival), I personally find the normal difficulty is good enough. 

The game doesn't have a lot of explanation/hints telling you how to craft weapons, armor, medicines, etc. You just have to figure it out, and you will get a hang of it, as soon you understand their mechanics. A few flaws and glitches in the game but it's not too bothering. I'll might as well say, the glitches can make the game still enjoyable and fun. 

I'm looking forward to Sons of the Forest. While waiting, might as well play The Forest again :)"

23232,"good game, not a lot to do tho"
23233,The game is extremely fun and I enjoy playing it. Personally I prefer to play with friends because I'm not the type of guy that plays horror alone. That thing out the way I would say if you like open world survival games and horror this is the game for you. It is also surprisingly realistic.

23323,My cousin and I murdered a group of island inhabitants and we ate them. We then got home from our school trip from Fiji and played The Forest Co-op. Can't recommend enough!
23324,"It's fun and entertaining, especially with friends. It gets really hard if you don't play at a good pace though."
23325,scary half naked woman chase me with stick and i pee myself

23343,this game has boobs and blood very good
23344,Wormie = Laffy Taffy
23345,"Okay, I usually am not one to write reviews but this game was SO good. I played it with a friend and the story line was really fun to figure out and follow along with as well as just playing a survival game in general was super fun. I really enjoyed periods where you just focused building your base, hunting, etc. and then you go to caves and really dive into the story line and the eeriness of the game. The ending also had me super surprised and after reading up on it, the amount of Easter eggs and depth that goes into the story is super impressive."
23346,"fun 
"
23347,"omg so good, very nice video game for my eyes to percieve would reccomend love dis game to da moon and back"
23348,good fun
23349,the game is so much fun
23350,"Building/Crafting. Exploring/Looting. Hunting/Scavenging. While not having a very diverse building/crafting system and only a handful of different enemies it's still great fun. The story whilst not completely engaging isn't entirely forgettable and the tasks tied to it will keep you entertained for a couple of hours, great fun and hours of playability with friends. Unlike most other ""Survival"" games this one isn't limited to above ground and features cave systems with rewards for those willing to explore, there are even secrets in the ocean! Decently balanced combat for the mechanics of the game with options to cater to most combat type preferences. 7/10 could have done with some crafting tweaks and additions."
23351,"I have played this game for some time now. I played on my playstation with my friends and I made new pc friends to do so here as well.

The Forest is a unique experience, the story aspect gives you the hopes to eventually finish your journey, but the ability to play differently or play as long as you want is truly one of the best aspects of it all."
23352,GOOD SCARY
23353,Great survival creepy game. Keeps your head up at all times
23354,fun
23355,very cool
23356,"Decent gameplay, but has a crappy building system. Going from this to Valheim is like night and day.

The cannibals put you constantly on edge if you aren't prepared and mutants freak you out. 
If that doesn't tickle your fancy, you can always do peaceful, which is basically you vs. the wilderness. 

F*** the caves though.

EDIT: fuck this game, fell through the ground, lost about 3-4 hours of progress"
23357,fantastic!
23358,nice.
23359,"I like The Forest very much, even though it sometimes scares the shit out of me and I absolutely hate those deformed babies who screech and jump in my face in attempt to kill me. 

I'd suggest people with a weak stomach to stay away from this game because there is a lot of gore from what I've seen already and I'm only at the beginning of the story.

If you have the chance to try it out, you totally should!

23420,"The best survival game I've ever played, it's really scary at times, and the gaphics are very good for being 2014 but there are plenty of buggs such as flying up in the air. Overall I think that the game is a 8/10"
23421,"well put together. Sometimes if you have lag in multiplayer you end up with a not good time and invisible enemies. Otherwise, love the story, like the building parts. Some of the achievements are funny. Messed up in a very good way."

23428,"The story is great, and its execution is subtle and engrossing. The sandbox in this game is great fun--but even if you don't spend dozens of hours building island forts and glider towers and cages for mutants and whatnot, it's a great little horror game with a well executed (if a little unoriginal) story and some fantastic adversaries. 9/10 :))"

23476,"There are Improvements to be had to this game, but i'd say its worth its price tag, specially if you got some friends to play with, 

>Pro's
It's cheap
Fun to play, and satisfying when you kill tons of Cannibals and mutants!
Tons of variations to base building, decent amount of different crafts of weapons and utility.
A pretty good sized map to explore, including a quite extensive underground area.
Enemies feel alien and foreign in every sense of the word, they may look somewhat human, but by god they are anything but.
Combat especially inside the caves can be quite challenging and fun.
The Environment feels alive, and is visually pleasing for the most part.
The Story is actually kinda interesting once you get into it and collect pictures, find missing passengers from the plane etc

>Cons
Can get stale if you play by yourself
Building a base, is a real time sink(getting an efficient method of transportation is vital, like zip-lines and log carts)
Combat is pretty repetitive n basic, and extremely clunky, like the Spear is long, but it feels more like its melee range is sat to the same as any other melee weapon.
I can't seem to remember the music in the game
Big grind fest, limited inventory
The Katana is somehow not the best melee weapon in the game, even tho it's an actual proper weapon, compared to these makeshift clubs and wood cutting axes.
Feel like they missed out on the opportunity to make metal forging a thing(could have just used metal scraps or even mined some, i mean there's plenty of rock formations, especially down inside the Caverns)
No Crafting animations, or animation when you wear armour(bone, hide etc) only a small effect that your char acknowledges that you put it on.

Overall, cheap fun game with friends, not a great game to play by yourself unless your really bored and forgo all the base building. Because building one yourself without cheats or mods is a super long endeavour. Decent story, freaky enemies, and a overall fun experience if ur into these kinda games

23480,Balls. Just straight balls. Also pink wormy things....
23481,good game so far

23489,edibles
23490,"great AI I'm Shocked on how adaptive the Ai is. Pretty Good Storyline Could of done with a juicier story overall. good building physics. building is immersive and intense you don't wanna build in the night definitely better in day. keep in mind the forest is a big grind if your going for 100% completion. very good combat physics for fish animals and cannibals. you have to be smart with where you put your base too. graphics are great,. if you leave tree stumps they will know where you have been lumbering and will then be agrovated and they can also glitch at the logs and be stuck circling them which mind you is pretty funny. raft and water physics are good. -Animal list,raccoon,deer,rabbit,different types of birds,boar,turtles,sharks,fish,-Cannibal types,Starving Cannibal Starving Cannibal.

23540,"dont care this game fun
"
23541,i really like how this game is very realistic and how it has a good storyline and you can play multiplayer
23542,"Cut down big tree
make bad man dead
eat Lizard
10/10"
23543,"Definitely a game that's best to be played with friends. It may be a little confusing at the start, but after getting the hang of it, definitely it's a game that's worth your time. :)"
23544,You need to try this game
23545,Reminds me of one particular game...
23546,bunger
23547,a
23548,"Mycket Gott Spel
"
23549,Don't waste your time playing solo with enemies because they will just show up and destroy your hours worth of work in about 30 seconds.  Complete waste of time.  The cannibals are unrealistically relentless in pestering you after your first night.  You won't get anything accomplished
23550,I must build a castle...
23551,"The biggest complaint I'd have to have for this game is the building, as it is, I suppose wonky is the only word I could use. It's so free that its very difficult to control. That being said, the building is far from impossible, as time goes on you figure out some tricks to get what you need.

As far as playing goes, this game is fantastic. although, the deer are cursed. You'll know what I mean once you play it!

The story so far is very obscured as I have not finished the game yet, What I have found so far intrigues me greatly. Its a captivating mystery so far, I have no doubt that it will have a captivating end. 

I would definitely recommend this game."
23552,"Nice game.
"
23553,"Great Game long enjoyable beginning with lots to do and much to explore with the up and coming action a bit later on
"
23554,"Great, with better AI and fixing some minor bugs it could be a very respected AAA title. The plot, concept, horror elements, crafting elements and cooperative possibilities create a strong mix that should not be missing in any game library."
23555,"definitely a fun game you must buy if you like playing with friends, building stuff and survival"
23556,"i came into this game with an open mind, after only 5 hours i want to blow my head off my shoulders..
i do not follow my friends i swear"
23557,amazing game
23558,"Ive only done 1 playthrough so far(i do plan on doing alot more) but i will say this. This game is infinitley better with a friend. Me and my friend had a blast being maniacs and psychopaths to the local people and wildlife.

10/10 would surround my wall in noose traps again"

23566,One of the best games I have ever played. It's hell of fun to play with friends. You can choose to complete it in an hour or in an hundred hours. I completed it 4 times and still playing
23567,ong sha geng
23568,good game if you are into scary survival game!
23569,"Tried to put a corpse on a log sled, ended up launching the log 30 ft away, crashing onto the river.
Sprinted while pushing the log sled down a hill, then launched myself 40 ft into the air, miraculously surviving with only a tinge of HP left.

Best fucking game I've played in decades 11/10"
23570,Great multiplayer survival.
23571,"amazing to play with friends and also fun if you're alone (and have good loot), it's really cool to mass murder cannibals with a chainsaw, also i personally love going to the mountain and sliding off of it with a turte shell, if you're looking for a scary survival game this is for you. also, i don't reccomend getting into the game without knowing anything about it (as in story item locations, weapon locations, etc.)."
23572,Good survival game to playing
23573,This game slaps but a few funny bugs. Not too game breaking tho. Great game.

23600,"esta god, el combate medio poronga pero lo recomiendo igual"
23601,"I got lost in this game. Crafting a super cool base was a lot of fun, making a network of bases was great, and the highlight of the game was interacting with the cannibals. It's nice to see an enemy that won't behave the same every time. 

There's a mod out there that lets you extend your ziplines. I highly recommend using that."
23602,good
23603,"the story line is amazing, if the forest ran me over with a car and curbstomped me, i would still say thank you. i recommend this game to all of my friends, even though it is a little graphic, its nothing you cant get used to. its definitely a must-play :)"
23604,"Super fun, gory, but fun. Especially with friends."
23605,good game
23606,"We do a little cannibalism, its called we do a little cannibalism."
23607,"Awesome survival horror, resource collecting, base building, cannibal slaughtering game. Exponentially better with friends. Nearly every time I've played The Forest recently, I've been either zoinked or sloshed and it really makes for an epic experience."
23608,(`>`)
23609,i enjoy making my friends mad by wandering off into the unknown and getting slaughtered
23610,"Its bad, its tedious; building especially doing things one log at a time. The late game *surface* area is completely barren.

So why the hell do I like it?
Story is decent enough, in the background.
Ambience is great.
Locations are exciting.
Building just enough is content-ive... is that a word?
Combat is basic but fun.
Mystery in thrilling.
Houseboats are cool.
For whatever is bad about it... yeh, I dont care. I enjoyed it."

23624,THIS GAME IS GOOD IT HAS BOOBIES
23625,me loved it
23626,This game can get hard and frustrating at times however the bases you can make can get really cool and intuitive if you have the right ideas and the story while not really guiding you is still a good one with all the cut scenes and the ending is a pretty good one in my opinion
23627,Please i wish i never live in a forest the amount of cannibals chasing after while trying to collect 80 logs for my new house.

23632,"This is the best survival game I ever played! I want to love survival games, but usually hate them. This has it all. Story, mystery, and not to overwhelming. I like I can just drink water. I don't have to kill a dinosaur, to make oil, to craft plastic, to make a water bottle, to seed clouds, to make rain, to drink before I die. This game is actually fun. But I'm not sure why there is ample boobs but no penis. That's the scariest part."

23647,very nice and solid game I liked it very much when I played with my friend but after finishing the game there is nothing to do but to try out the new mods and that is all all in all it is a great game just find a friend to play it with before u buy it

23678,"The Forest first introduced itself as a janky early access alpha. It's much more polished now, and while some residual jank remains there are a lot of features and details that make it well worth a playthrough. The combat and crafting have a lot of variety, there's an actual story that can be enjoyed cooperatively, and the VR support is surprisingly decent for what I assume was an afterthought.

I laughed, I screamed, I ate a family. I did not expect to enjoy this game but was very pleasantly surprised."

23684,a bit scary but overall it's fun. jiggling honkers of  the mutants/ cannibals were good too B^)
23685,"Its an incredibly fun game with friends, building is kinda of a hassle but thats just my opinion.

8/10 Game"
23686,awesome game to play with friends
23687,"I personally enjoy this game. It's a great roleplay/survival horror game.

Pros:
Hunger and thirst bars.
Usually realistic.
Pretty good combat, though a more modern gun would certainly be appreciated.
Fleshed out story.
Semi-fleshed out cannibals, however they could use a little more work to establish their religion, and whatnot. But you can even teach them, that you're peaceful. By using a stick with some cloth on it, to block all their attacks, without hurting them. Walking slowly, and never turning your back to them... etc. But you can sort of ""tame"" them, which i really like.
The graphics are alright.
Can be genuinely terrifying on singleplayer.

Cons:
Incredibly difficult, which some players may not like.
Nudity, which makes it hard to stream this game on sites like YouTube and Twitch.
It can get REALLY dark. And i mean, the ""you can barely even see your hands"" kind of dark. And that's difficult to deal with. But a very minor con, nonetheless.
It doesn't really do much of a good job at making you care about TImmy. But saving him, is not really the point of the game, nowadays. Used to be though.
Very bad memory management. Can easily crash some computers.
Can't set character as left handed. But not really an RPG, anyways.

But overall, it's one of my top 10 favorite games."
23688,great game to play with friends especially if those friends get jumped by cannibals
23689,cannot wait for the second one
23690,"Amazing game, and very much worth playing with a friend. I will say that it is frustrating to have to play the entire game again to try a different ending, so create a new save file, don't overwrite. Awesome game, looking forward to the next one."

23749,"Initially, I found this game very frustrating. Where am I supposed to go? What am I supposed to do? What‚Äôs the point? A new player really needs some basic direction. Once I understood to build a camp, a fire, a spear, with a compass and map to find, that was it. Now I am many hours in and no intention of stopping anytime soon. This is just phenomenal fun. It‚Äôs the perfect mix of sandbox and structure. For the price you simply can‚Äôt beat it. I can easily see myself playing this for 100+ hours."

The horror and gameplay aspect to this game is also rlly well done. This game is piss scary especially in caves.

EDIT:            (59.6 Hours at Time of Review)

After 40+ hours after writing this review my opinion on the game has heavily made me happier I spent 10$ when on sale but this game is worth the full 20$. The content and possibility is hundreds of hours worth and you can find your own way of joy. I found my passion in achievements with the goal of 100% the game, its truly refreshing the access to hundreds of community videos and muitiplayer options make this game as lovable as games like terraria or stardew valley, etc. (Note: Still very fun to play single player)

I bought it in early 2022 with the goal of completing it before the new games release and I'm proud to say that I'm so close to doing so and waiting for Sons of the forest release in the fall!! This game is definitely a 9/10!! Highly Recommend."

23805,"This game could be fun if it weren't built like a piece of shit. Nothing works right! you have to google just to try and figure out how to save your games properly and perform basic tasks. The structure builder works poorly at best and everything in the game is designed to be overly difficult for no reason, as an example should you die you respawn back at the plane and your life is almost zero you have no stamina and your often covered in blood which is basically like being poisoned. whats the point of respawning if your basically dead again. Overall would enjoy this game if it wasn't hacked together like the piece of shit that it is. Certainly glad I bought this onsale and didn't pay full price"

My brother pointed us in the direction of this game during Christmas and now it is a family event every week.
23828,"is good cusue it has a story
"
23829,"The Forest is all about surviving and getting out alive but, now that I finally did it, I can't wait to get back to it in the upcoming sequel!


Pros:
Exceptional exploration with no hand holding.
Caves that are better dungeons than those in most RPG games.
Ambient audio.
The forest can really look gorgeous.
Unpredictable A.I. makes the natives look and feel threatening
Simple but functional crafting system.
Original and fun inventory design.

Cons:
Impolished/buggy.
Could use more hotkeys.
Enemies in the caves should respawn.
Enemies in the middle of my base should not.
Items respawning in the same place are easily exploitable and kind of silly.


What you're probably thinking is that The Forest is a survival focused game where you're supposed to build a fort and simply persist. Cant blame you for I was under the same impression until I got my hands on the game.
While survival can be the name of the game, me and my friends led mostly nomadic lives, building only what was necessary to spend the night while catering only to the most basic needs and staying constantly on the move throughout the peninsula and its network of underground caves in pursuit of our goals.
It is up to you to choose how you want to play and set your own pace for exploration as The Forest's gameplay is flexible and free-form. I'd say it was more of an adventure than a survival game for most of us but, that does not have to apply to you and your band of brothers.

Personally, I enjoyed the exploration the most and can't even remember all of the times that The Forest left me gasping in amazement. Successfully navigating through and surviving the perils of the cave systems felt like a rewards of it's own to which the frequent ‚Äúlore chunks‚Äù and occasional gear upgrades were more of a cherry on top.
The lack of hand holding greatly amplified the reward and the experience for me as everything we did, every cave that we successfully navigated and went through felt like it was 100% our doing as there were no ‚Äúarrows‚Äù guiding our way to take the credit, and the moderate consumption and distribution of previously prepared rations encouraged us to embark on another expedition and conquer the peninsula and all of it's nook's and cranny's, one by one.


Other than exploration, there's also a simple yet sufficient base building aspect to The Forest.
Cutting down trees to make walls and huts, getting familiar with, harvesting and eventually cultivating local flora (and even some fauna) comes with advantages of their own ‚Äì as well as the consequences.
Sure, it's great to have a place called home but should you stay in it for too long and make a ruckus while doing it, be prepared to deal with your new and openly unhappy neighbors.

The natives will take actions proportionate to yours (or so it seemed to us) so if you desecrate their hunting groves or over-expand into their territory, be prepared for more than a couple of sleepless nights. Also keep in mind that violence breeds violence so, if it's not necessary or in self-defense, try not to cast the first stone. Cowering in the nearby bushes or simply running away is probably the best option - unless you crave bloodshed.

One last thing to mention is that, unlike most games dabbling in the survival genre, The Forest actually has the beginning and the ending. It even provides the player with optional activity that will encourage exploration and investigation which I highly recommend doing as it will shed some light on the history of the the land and events that took place there.
Whether it's a good story or a mediocre one, well, that's up for you to decide but I can say that I really liked it and that it definitely wasn't a bad one. Those of you who liked 


Still having doubts? I say pick it up!
Support the small, creative team and help them make a sequel worthy of The Forest. I personally can't recommend it enough."

23850,"18hrs in like 3 days... this game is good! I had it sitting in my library for a few years and just started playing it!!! A few bugs, but most of them are just funny. The horror while traveling in the caves is top notch, especially when you have FOV set to realistic (I'm totally immersed). Base building is as addicting as Minecraft, being able to build awesome bases and defending them with traps, while fighting off packs of harder cannibals and mutants as the days progress. Plenty of crafting tools, armor, and weapons as well as modifying options for your weapons. The ai mechanics/animations are great and very realistic to a mysterious but maniac tribal people. Very re-playable game and if you can get it on sale, it's a steal! Looking forward to Sons of The Forest this year!"

23878,"Cannibalnya freak banget , teriak-teriak bikin kagetüò°"
23879,"I'll keep this short

Having backed this game since the start, I'll say it's been journey. Lots have changed during it's development, but I have to say that the crew behind The Forest have made a near perfect survival game that can be enjoyed alone or even more so with friends! It's incredibly scary and horrifying but at the same time the most serine relaxing game I've come across in a survival.
if you're into straight up survival, this game can challenge you just against it's nature, but if you include the indigenous you'll be in for quite the hellish experience. Be aware, you can treat this as a sandbox game, or a story driven scare game guaranteed to keep you  on your toes be that in the deepest of caves or dark forests.

I would always recommend this to anyone, because Steam allows you to play for a few hours and should you find you hate it; get a refund! - I doubt even the most picky of players will request a refund tho, as this game has been with me for years, and for years I've played it alone and with friends over and over... Each time finding different things to do and different ways to play. Who doesn't love making giant Tarzan-land covered Forests or Castles to fend off foes...

Anyhow, do try it! You won't regret it!"
23880,brrrrrrr zooom aqaaaaaa
23881,"Love the game. You can actually be creative with the building instead of just clicking things together like Ikea furniture. You'll get plenty of scares playing through it the first few times and it's so much fun to play with friends. The story is ok but I didn't really play it for the story. If I had a knock on the game it would be lacking some depth in story. Can't wait for Brothers of the Forest to come out in May, looks really good!"
23882,Great game to play with friends.  I'm enjoying it.
23883,Really like how the game doesn't provide a lot of help or instruction on how to survive.  Also appreciate how the player isn't pushed into following the storyline.  Very immersive experience.  Very scary going out into the dark at night.  Exploring the caves with a weak flashlight is terrifying.  Great game overall

It's always super rewarding when you discover new things to craft and new places to explore. 100/10!"
23937,If I knew I could keep playing on the same save file I would have left Timmy for dead
23938,"One of the best story driven survival games.

Yes, there is a story and lore which i think is good enough for a survival game.

Basicly you crash land on an island and you want to get out. With your son preferably. 
On the island are a load of cannibals and mutants that want to eat your meat.

This game has one of the best atmosphere i seen in a game. The level of horror, the eerie winds blowing through the trees and dark damp caves which you can explore. Even the music of the intro screen or the tapes you find really fit the horror genre.

10/10 and i can't wait for Sons of the Forest"

23951,"The Forest is a buggy mess that failed to grasp my interest from a gameplay standpoint. If I didn't have friends to play it with, I likely would have never bought the game entirely because of the poor polish and my own personal difficulty with getting into survival games. But, the game came on sale, prompting my friends and I to get the game. 

We had a group of four. One friend who had completed the game prior on PS4, one friend who had watched a playthrough on YouTube, and two noobs (I was a noob). My time in The Forest featured many bugs (some entertaining, others deterring), an addicting gameplay loop and lots and lots of deforestation. We setup camp near the yacht per our leader's recommendation and began our playthrough. Our gameplay boils down to two categories; Base building & piss-farting around, and exploring. We all contributed a little to our eyesore of a base, but the other noob in our group spent the most time building. In one instance, he spent about 2 hours at the base building up a large custom house that we barely ended up using. During this time, the rest of us were deep underground stood in a circle messing with the [i] awful [/i] in-game voice chat making each other laugh in any way we could. As for the other half of our playthrough, we'd always go cave exploring the moment we get bored of base building. I did a lot of ""follow the guy who has his map out"" so I didn't have to lead the pack, meaning I didn't get the full experience of the exploration aspect of this game, but it worked out for me. We'd explore the caves and always emerge satisfied with the loot we'd find, and go back to base building. This gameplay loop was enough for us to jump back and forth between the two sides of the game without getting bored. Overall, the gameplay was good. 

However, this gameplay would not have kept me hooked personally. Without nostalgic value, a fresh survival game is like trying to do nofap. I'm willing to give it a go, but I'd likely give up after a couple hours. What kept me going was my friends engagement in the experience. Since most of them seemed to be immersed in the adventure, it was a lot of fun to play and mess about with them. Now that we've finished our playthough, I likely won't touch this game again unless its with other friends. 

TLDR: The game is awfully made, but fun to play. If you have friends to play it with, your positive experience is guaranteed. I look forward to the sequel."
23952,i love this game so munch i can not get enough of it i have over 20 hrs in still not tired of it if anybody looking for a good survival game this game is for you worth the price i paid for evan the vr is so good perfect 10 out of 10 game

I have recently purchased this game , this game  is quiet good but when i was playing the game with my friends from nowhere a bomb came and exploded our base in the game and abusive words were being spammed by our accounts even though we weren't typing . This game is in serious need of security upgrade. Hope the team takes action about it , if not so please give me refund."

23987,"If you're interested in a survival game about being trapped in an uninhabited part of the world, surrounded by native cannibals, with the ability to build up your own base from scratch in any way so you please; avoid The Forest at all costs and go buy Green Hell instead. 

The Forest is a collection of half-baked ideas slapped together and brimming with frustrating controls and gameplay. If you decide to just use of the of the pre-built structures for saving and sleeping and spend the rest of the game just speedrunning through the main quest, then maybe you'll get a few hours of distraction from it. But if you try to engage with any of the game's base building aspects (aka: the main feature of the game), you're going to be left disappointing at best and furious at worst. 

First of all, none of your build-able items have descriptions so if you want to know what a thing does or how to best use it, you'll be going to a wiki constantly. Furthermore, very few items actually snap together, forcing you to do your best to eyeball structures as you cobble them together. And as far as I can tell, when you try to place the blueprint of an item, there's no way to 'scroll' that blueprint closer or father from you. So you have to move your character first to line it up, which can cause a ton of problems if you're trying to build in a tight space or in a precarious position. And by the way, don't make the mistake I did and waste all the time and resources building a fireplace thinking you could use the FIREPLACE to make fires or cook food. Nope. It's a decoration only. 

It's that kind of baffling gameplay choices that you'll find everywhere in The Forest. Food you put on fires has no cook time indicator, so you might not even notice you put down something small like bird or rabbit meat and leaving you to guess at how long it will take to finish. Also, you are unable to take cooked food and put it in your inventory. Once you put it in a fire, your only option is to eat it. But if you leave it in too long, it burns, lowering its value. You're only able to sleep at specific times, so if you're low on energy and have no food to keep it up, you're kinda just screwed. Also, I hope you enjoy being attacked by natives. A lot. Because no matter where you go to try and build on the map, you're going to be fending off cannibals several times a day, every single day to the point where you can barely even get through cutting down a tree. And this isn't late game mobs, either. No, you're dealing with this annoyance day one.  Not that failing combat even matters. As long as you lose all your HP outside, all the cannibals do is drag you into the same cave and string you up, forcing you to cut yourself down and trek back home. You don't even lose any your things, or even much time, so there's no thrill to combat; its just this annoying thing you have to do all the time.

Overall, everything The Forest does can be found better in other survival games. If the concept of this game still seems interesting to you, I would HIGHLY suggest getting Green Hell instead as it has everything this game has to offer with none of its problems. As for The Forest? I bought this game for $8 and I still feel ripped off."

24026,"The game is full of bugs.... I mean full.... I watch a bunch of cannibals just die in front of me for no reason.... I managed to get the kill 100 cannibals achievement with only killing maybe 4 myself.

The game is too dark most of the time and I know that is for the horror atmosphere but really it was just annoying.

The Story was OK but the way it was presented was shallow and reminded me of old fallout 76.

Game was unbalanced in combat especially with the mutants and you are basically swarmed by enemies if you don't build your base on an island or make a boathouse."

Its both tons of fun when playing with friends, but horrifying to play on your own.

I wouldn't recommend if you don't have friends willing to buy it or you want something that plays as intended."

Simple, straightforward survival gameplay with an easy to use and ""just-enough"" build system compliment the clunky but accessible feel of the game.

24058,"Build a base, cut down a tree, tree fall on base, base gone, repeat. Enjoy!"
24059,"Great Survival experience, with a compelling underlying story driven by exploration. Its great with friends, and pretty challenging solo but there is fun to be had either way. Besides who doesn't want to live their best life on-a island invested with crazy mutants! I also love that there is an actual ending (multiple in fact) to be had, with full cut-scenes and everything. some real AH-HA moments that will stick with you."
24060,fun
24061,"disgusting game  i couldnt find any rabbits for the glider pluys my glider disapeared when my game crashed even tho i saved
"
24062,"The forest is a great survival game that in my opinion is much better with friends but still great even if playing alone. Even tho i haven't played it that much, I still think it's great! If you like survival games but you're not sure if you're gonna like The Forest, just think of it like it's ARK: survival evolved but with no dinosaurs. I hope this review was helpful!"

24077,I would recommend this game to anyone. The story is great but the survival aspect is what makes this game amazing. This game so fun with friends to mess around with and the weapon system is great.

24083,"I only have 38 hours here but I have so many more on ps4, I recommend this game so often and know it like the back of my hand. its so fun, a little scary but its the type of game to really draw someone in. there's a lot to do, a lot to craft, so many different play styles. Almost endless possibilities. I will forever recommend this game to other people!"
24084,"It's alright I guess


Very awesome game, I am very excited for the second one!"

24127,"It was a beautiful start of 2022. We played this game together, he and I. While there are thousands of miles between us in real life, in game it felt like we were really close to each other. We built a base together, - it wasn't anything fancy but it was nice sharing a living space with him. We went against cannibals and mutants together. I would lie if I said it wasn't challenging. Not just for the fighting part; I got to see how hot - tempered he is when things got messy. It even led to an argument between us but it was nice getting to know the other side of him and overcoming struggles together. Like in real life.

We went to hunt animals together. He was the one who taught me the art of hunting and, let me tell you, I've never felt more confident about my skills than I did back then. Finally I was able to provide meat food for both of us, not just berries. Surviving in the forest together really brought us close. I remember that delicate moment he approached me to have a suck on my peen for the first time. It was unforgettable. And it's become a thing we treated each other to on a regular basis ever since. I've never felt being so close to him. So intimate. We even had a threesome once. It was a stranger that we stumbled upon during our journey. We parted our ways soon after but he kept thinking about that person and the experience we had as a trio for quite a while.

Looking after our home base, cutting trees, crafting stuff, exploring caves, stalking animals, dismembering and eating people, experiencing countless bugs, looking for trouble and regretting it after, having arguments and sorting them out, creating a space to live and survive together, teaching and learning from each other, speaking la langue de l'amour... It was nice sharing a life with him. Far from the civilization. Just the two of us. Living together. Getting close. In game. Beautiful start of 2022.

24155,"I've been playing this game since it was in Alpha. Its changed a lot since then. And i would recommend it to anyone that is looking for a survival horror experience.  

Its fun to play with friends or alone. And its modding friendly. Give it a shot! it's worth the price in my opinion."
24156,good with friends only
24157,"Personally, I thought the game was good. I speedran the game just so I could get to the part where I tag team my son with a giant monster. Played in VR so i could really feel that thang"

24176,"English/German review

The Forest is an entertaining survival game, which mainly convinces with it¬¥s surprising ending.
Visual and playful bugs sometimes occur, but this also provides the game a certain charm, since these bugs rarely occur and never affect the entire gaming experience. The team behind the survival game is also quite small.

Overall 8,5/10

The Forest ist ein unterhaltsames Survivalspiel, welches vorallem mit seinem √ºberraschendem Ende √ºberzeugt.
Teilweise treten Visuelle als auch spielerische Bugs auf, dadurch entwickelt das Spiel jedoch auch eine gewisse Charme, da diese Bugs selten auftreten und nie das gesamte Spielerlebnis zerst√∂ren und das Team hinter dem Survivalspiel auch recht klein ist.

Im gro√üen ganzen eine 8,5/10"

24198,"Ratatouille is a 2007 American computer-animated comedy film produced by Pixar Animation Studios and released by Walt Disney Pictures. The eighth film produced by Pixar, it was written and directed by Brad Bird, who took over from Jan Pinkava in 2005, and produced by Brad Lewis, from an original idea from Bird, Pinkava and Jim Capobianco. The title refers to the French dish ratatouille, which is served at the end of the film, and also references the species of the main character, a rat. Set in Paris, the plot follows the rat named Remy, who dreams of becoming a chef and tries to achieve his goal by forming an alliance with a Parisian restaurant's garbage boy."

That being said, I thoroughly enjoyed the game more than I thought I would. Played the first time in multiplayer, and then played again in single player to explore more. The crafting, exploring, and unravelling the story make the gameplay interesting. Oh. I hated that the blueprints for constructing buildings are hard to use, so make sure that shit's straight or else you'll get a wonky cabin! The cannibals and mutants can get annoying from time to time when you just want to explore. And those weird, flying dick mutants... wtf was that?! :))

But overall, very immersive and enthralling. And a really good game to play with friends as it can get boring and scary alone, haha"

24253,"by far one of my favorite survival games, theres an underlying story behind everything driving you towards the end story however short as it may be but the game will make you want to take your time build up your base and find everything you possibly can.

with plenty of tense moments this game is by far best enjoyed with friends either LAN or Online.

Ive played this game maybe 5 times beginning to end and never grow tired of booting it up again a few months later with some mates and re-exploring the forest.

10/10 would crash land and lose my son again."

\"
24260,"Decent game, but it has a ton of   [b]j a n k[/b]. Read through at your own peril but I'm gonna go over every single point I can remember off the top of my head:

+ Combat has a steep learning curve, but is fun
+ Aesthetic for the enemies, especially the mutants is great
+ Definitely gives me horror vibes, but not more than I can handle
+ Inventory UI is unique, and quite nice to look at
+ The story of the game is short and interesting
+ Base building is quite fun and customizable, love the House Boat
+ You can upgrade a rock with flammable cloth and set it on fire in your hands for a flaming rock weapon

+- This is the first game I've played where having 400 ping is actually an advantage. Animals do not even react fast enough to you sprinting up to them and stabbing them with a spear. It's nice but I'm not sure how I feel about it. Playing in my friend's lobby I was downright unkillable

- The game is honestly too dark. I know lighting is a mechanic but sometimes it's straight up unplayable for me. How can cave interiors be brighter than the open forest under the moonlight?
- Some obvious features don't exist, for example choosing which arrows to retrieve/deposit into an arrow basket
- The crafted bow feels like hot garbage, and I hear it was made this way because they added the modern bow. Doesn't make sense in my opinion, if it sucks so hard you wouldn't use it in the first place
- 4 hotkeys maximum? Really?
- You can't turn on/off flashlights on bows. Replacing the battery requires dismantling the modified bow, crafting batteries into the flashlight, then crafting it back into the bow. Makes 0 sense
- Lighter and handheld flashlight share the same keybind, meaning you can't choose which you pull out without going into the inventory. Lazy move on the dev's part
- You cannot disable the auto-equip of the Rebreather, meaning that once you acquire it, any submerge will start draining your air canisters
- Aiming for spears is atrocious. You cannot aim below a certain angle, so if a critter is too close to you, you gotta find some other ranged weapon to use on it
- Most weapons are redundant in this game. Weapons you get at the end of the game (Machete) are downright useless compared to weapons you get at the start (Modern Axe). The pistol is garbage considering how long it takes to assemble it
- *Permanent* weapon upgrades go away when you die. Doesn't make sense to me, unless the cannibals/mutants are stealing the glass shards right off your weapon after you're dead
- The gazebo isn't sheltered for some reason. Seems easy enough to just put a covering of leaves over it, but I guess that was too much developer time and money to implement
- It makes no sense that you can store 10 boulders, a chainsaw, 2 bows, 7 spears, 50 arrows and 4 axes in your bag, [b]but not a single animal head trophy[/b]
- Inventory management system being restricted by item quantities rather than max weight kinda sucks. Makes no sense that I can load up with all the above mentioned items, but can't drop 5 boulders to make way for 10 more lizard skins
- Lots of stuff falls through floors. Had several primed dynamite sticks fall through the floor before they could explode
- Bow/Crossbow aiming changes perspective when you crouch. I don't know about you but I wouldn't hip fire my bow just cause I was crouching down. It should keep its perspective no matter what position you are in, as it would in real life
- Plenty of outfits in the game that you'll never get to see cause you can't see yourself. Unless your outfits are only made of pants and sleeves
- Cold damage makes no sense. Rabbit fur boots exist that give 20 cold armour, along with the Warmsuit which gives 100. However cold damage cannot be prevented unless you have 100. Ergo, rabbit fur boots have no use in the game and are just a noob trap
- Baby damage is wayy overtuned in this game. How does a baby hit for like 120 damage on Hard, but a Cowman does no damage on charge knockdown
- Several arrow types exist in this game, including Bone and Modern arrows. However, Bone arrows are retrieved as wood arrows, and modern arrows convert to wood arrows after having fire/poison applied to them. So basically only wood arrows matter
- You can store raw, bloody meat and severed cannibal limbs in your bag. But you cannot store berries without a fur pouch
- For some reason, thrown cannibal molotovs cause my game to stutter every few seconds. I like that they exist, they just have crap performance
- Sharing system is crap. You can only trade 1 quantity of 1 item on the sharing tray at a time. It also makes no sense that the ONLY way to pass something to someone else is to put it on a tray instead of like... Dropping it on the ground maybe?
- I just remembered, you can't drop most stuff on the ground. This is a flaw of their weird inventory management system
- I can wear 10 pieces of creepy armour but the armour rack will only hold 9..?
- You can only carry 10 crossbow bolts, but the flare gun can be loaded with 10'000 flare ammo, ironically making it a better and more convenient ranged weapon than the crossbow
- Flintlock pistol parts in multiplayer are not shared, so you'll have to kill your friends to see who gets the one pistol, which ends up being a crap weapon compared to the modern bow/crossbow so you end up with no DPS and no friends
- You cannot pick up and discard burnt food from a fire pit. You literally have to force yourself to eat coal to get rid of it. If you accidentally loaded up your fire pit with spoiled meat, you can't get rid of it either. You have to wait until it becomes coal, then force yourself to eat all of it, or else your fire pit becomes unusable
- Forcing you to use turtle shells to craft water collectors seems unrealistic. I'm fairly certain people use like banana leaves and stuff IRL to do that. Also cause the dead flesh stuck to the shell might poison your water over time
- Breaking buildings doesn't return any materials to you. Not even partially
- I've never heard of a log holder before. I'm pretty sure it's easier to just pile logs on the floor rather than build a log cage out of sticks
- It isn't obvious ANYWHERE that you can upgrade storage buildings to a higher tier. I finished the game twice before figuring that part out because the icon for it looks like it would mean ""Reverse orientation"" or ""Flip"". A plus sign would've been sufficient but apparently that wasn't intuitive enough
- I can put 10 sticks in my bag, but to store 5 spears which are made of 2 sticks each, I need a separate bag made of boar leather. 2head move by the devs

At this point you probably think I'm being nitpicky. That's because I am. A lot of these were obvious QoL or common sense things, that a game priding itself on [b]REALISM[/b] should have thought about long ago. If this game was in beta/early access, I would be recommending it. Unfortunately we're way past that and some parts of the game still feel like garbage. 4 hotkeys in a game where you get pants pockets and a backpack feels like an archaic design and is not fun at all, considering how many hoops the devs make you go through to do simple things - like picking berries. I definitely have more criticism to throw at the game but this is just what I thought of off the top of my head. Game needs work"

24282,"You should be able to save Megan. I hate games that force you to kill dogs or kids.

Not talking about the cave babies mind you, I killed every one I saw."
24283,"An open world exploration game with a lot of interesting hidden secrets. If crafting items, exploring caves and fighting off cannibalistic monsters is your thing, then this game might be for you. 

Fantastic game with alot todo and build, I'm 33 hours in and I'm still finding new things in the game. The longer you play,  the more the game will challenge you, in a good way.

The game does seem to have a few bugs and the over all inventory setup could definitely use some work but nothing major in my opinion. 

Over all I give the game a 4/5 
Great survival game, fun with a couple of friends, easily able to spend hours and hours discovering new things."

24286,great
24287,"the first about 5 hours of this game i had the idea that it was a pretty ""standard"" forest survival game. 

oh lord god is it so much more-
this game's story has so much meaning and complexity, and there's so much hidden in the game; but what i find interesting is that the majority of this is completely optional. Don't care about Timmy or the passengers, so be it, go and build a cabin. But if you take the chance to explore and really dive into the story it is scary, addicting, and SO COOL

i find complex story games like this so fascinating, and am very excited for Sons of the Forest. 

get this game. and play the whole story."

24313,"i love this game
"
24314,"I adore this game.
It is difficult, but most of the time not over bearing. It is scary and calming at times. The AI, at least to me, is insane.
I love the building side of things. You can make a fort or castle if you wish. I personally have 3 places walled off meeting with zip lines.

The graphics are pretty good, nothing insane. Night time is like DayZ in the you're gonna see maybe a foot in front of you maybe, and only broad shapes

The map is of good size, and thankfully very easy to remember, but also VERY easy to get lost in.

This game is definetaly going to be in my favorites and if you're having issues I HIGHLY recommend the YouTuber Farket. This dude pretty much leads the way on whats to know in The Forest."

i hope the sons of the forest will have better VR support but I doubt it will at all. this game also scarred me for life NOT FOR THE FAINT OF HEART!"

The graphics are awesome and there is a bunch of content, I played this game for 5 hours and haven't really moved from my starting point because there is just so much to do, so much to kill, so much to explore. The map seems huge and very fast, with all kinds of nooks and crannies to look into and explore. Fun game."
24357,"Well, Yeah i think its the best survival game its my opinion but its so fun with CO-OP playing with friends building home and then getting killed by mutant, I just think this is the best game i ever played, Well not really goodbye."
24358,"I love this game so much! That being said, there are still some pros and cons to it.
Pros: Almost always in some threat that keeps gameplay fast moving, Fun and intuitive crafting interface, intriguing story, good progression from early-game to late-game items and gear, multiplayer is always a blast with friends! Enemies are cool, scary, and just difficult enough to keep things really interesting. You really do earn everything you have.

Cons: The custom structure building mechanics are very difficult to get used to, and even then, building custom stuff is a chore. Buildings can get demolished by falling trees and even just one wave of enough enemies. Rebuilding is a constant struggle until late-game. It is very possible to lose all your hard earned itmes and be forced to start over from scratch. Any bugs you encounter will not be fixed as it is not priority at all since a new sequel is coming out soon. Hard to run on less powerful computers

If you are able to look passed the cons and really immerse yourself in the game, I can not suggest this enough. I've played this for so long because even with its flaws, it's a fantastic game with a great community and lots of online help if you get stuck. Have fun!"

24398,"i would 100% recommend this game because of its great graphics and gameplay - the story is rich, there is enemies that you fight against (or you can choose peaceful mode) and you can build and design your own base anywhere on the map. I would say both single player and multiplayer are great and for its price (i got it on a sale) i think your friends would be willing to buy it! i honestly think its worth the money. Overall i wouldnt say there is any major annoying glitches (except the log sled glitch where it gets stuck and you cant pick it up but it doesnt effect the gameplay so its fine). Have fun playing the game!"

24414,"Played through this game over the course of a week with a couple of friends. While crafters and survival horror games aren't usually my taste, I really enjoyed The Forest. It's genuinely spooky, and the crafting mechanics are intuitive and fun. Jump-scares and gross-outs happen organically. You can really get lost in the atmosphere. Playing solo was too freaky for me. Chopping down a tree while cannibals stare at you from the woods, breathing heavy? Ugh. No thanks. Playing with a group was still tense, but in a fun way. You know you're going to wind up going down the big pit in the middle of the map, eventually - How you get there, though - that's the story."
24415,GOOD
24416,"[h1]The Forest Game Review [/h1]
[h2]TL:DR[/h2]
I've never been so fun playing survival game that look similarly to Minecraft, except it gives Horror environment with the island inhabited by intelligent cannibals looking for cannibalizing you. You are to survive by making shelter and gathering resource while also looking for Timmy and other missing passengers.
This game is just so worth, It also provides Multiplayer mode where the story wise you also have other passenger surviving with you(of course it would be CO-OP Quest story although it would reduce Horror atmosphere in the game).

[b]The Forest Terrain and Environment[/b]
The environment, Graphic of Terrain in the game are so HD is fancy. the game has fixed terrain and places, means making multiple world will have the same terrain and location of caves(only plane which would be your spawn are different) atleast the map is not too big than other Similar Open world games, which mean you will likely less watching clue or walkthrough from internet to progress your story.

[b]The Forest Gameplay Mechanic[/b]
By explanation as simple as possible, this game is an open world survival game played in first person perspective, where you have the decision of how do you want to survive(whether be it making shelter guided by basic surviving knowledge book and marking place as your home, or attacking the other Tribe and cannibalizing them).
The game provides basic knowledge that can be used for real life surviving in the forest such as making fire, shelter, how to find water, SOS signal, etc.

As for Creatures, are designed with well controlled movement. Take an example of deer or rabbit, it can smell you right away when you want to hunt them. You can have this problem solved by disguised with nature which will reduce their awareness of you(this work for Cannibals as well).
The first time you meet Cannibal would be your best experience, they often move in a group and not attacking carelessly unlike mobs in other game. they are designed so well that it has nearly sapient intelligent level, capable of surrounding you, attacking you from behind, and even stalk and scout you from away.

[b]The Forest Story Review Warning Contain spoiler[/b]
The game provides the scene where you and your son named Timmy were on the plane. The plane went turbulence and crashed on an unknown island, where you son is taken to somewhere unknown. while surviving you are also besought to find clues about where your son is taken off, finding whether are there any other passenger survivor, and clues about man made things which is abandoned.
While Progressing the story, I found it enjoyable and giving Horror atmospheric feeling. it's wiser to explore the side caves before you exploring the main cave because it require some item to be fulfilled in order to progress which lead to the explanation of how cannibal exist, what caused your plane to crash, and many more.

[b]Weakness and things you should considerate [/b]
the game also has weaknesses, which I thought would be:
[olist]
[*]lacking of late game weapons since you need to progress the story in order to obtain more stronger weapon and the more you progress the story, somewhat the tougher they become.
[*]lack of late game building ideas since the book only provide basic knowledge of survival.
[*]the game actually demand you to find other missing passenger and Timmy rather than enjoying survival because the cannibal does attack you occasionally whether you're on your shelter in the morning, or trying to sleep and woke up being surrounded, etc.
[*] I only played this CO-OP, I did singleplayer but didn't progress the story since CO-OP feels merrier and more fun. but I found out that even we did CO-OP the Mutant(I haven't mention this, they're different than cannibal) is quite tough, strong and require tactic to kill it. [spoiler] let alone the final boss [/spoiler], i can't Imagine how hard it would be if i played it singleplayer.
[/olist]
That's all my Opinion I can give, my verdict has been given on top of my comment."
24417,cock
24418,"If you really want to feel the meaning of loneliness and surviving on your own among scary cannibals and awful freaky monsters , going through hell and back to fine every item that is useful , to build a little camp that would keep you alive for at least the first week and above all , to fell the stress of running as fast as you can just to stay alive during the mid-night rain storms , I recommend you to play the Single-player campaign.

Btw, Try to get the KATANA Sword on the first day , Trust me you gonna need it :)"

24439,Very good
24440,"This can be a fun game, but I think you have to play with friends. It's worth noting that I played as a guest with others and had no idea this game had an actual story. 
Potential Spoiler- As a guest, you get a slightly different intro, so I had no idea why I should find this Timmy kid on my objective list, it wasn't until I played some solo that I saw an alternative perspective and realized. I think this is a neat dynamic, but the lack of awareness for the game made it difficult to follow and I just thought it was a ""Rust"" like game.
This lack of story created an environment where we spent most of our play time cutting down forests and building bases, zip-lines, and other intricacies before one of my party started reading online... Then it all changed. We went from trying to manage our village to exploring and achieving goals. These goals and my companions understanding of the game gave us purpose and this is when I started to enjoy the game...
Until we ran into several glitches and issues (destroyed points for one do not mean everyone sees it destroyed or your location may not match up with some locations of items- reloading fixed many issues by resetting values. Another issue was achievement tracking in the system didn't register so for some doing this, you may have to host a separate game to get those that don't register correctly). We worked through them, but these issues can severely disrupt the enjoyable nature of the game.
One key takeaway for those willing to brave the game- guest saves are separate from the host... so if the guest saves and the host reverts their save, the guest maintains everything. This is nice for guests.
If it weren't for the multiple bugs, I would definitely rate this more favorably, but it's still an enjoyable game with a good group."

24455,"This game saved my life.

I am 38.

My ex-wife and I have a daughter together, and adopted our son together. They are now both 4 years old.

When we were going through our separation, I found myself lost and miserable. I was self destructive. I got so mad one day from everything spiraling out of my control that I punched some concrete in a moment of overwhelming emotion. That caused me to break my 5th metacarpal in my right hand... my working hand... my games hand.. the hand that I held and carried my children to bed with.. The hand I desperately needed to make sure I could continue to provide.

After learning of the severity of my self-inflicted damage, I was borderline suicidal. Keep in mind that just a few months before this, I was the happiest man with no history of depression or anxiety. I have never had fits of rage, or been one to break down and cry, but I was in a low spot that just really buried me from being able to see the light on the other side.

Having nothing better to do, I searched for a game I could play, ONE HANDED while I recovered. I somehow stumbled upon this game and read some of the reviews. I decided that it had to be worth a shot... I must admit, I didn't beat the game, or play nearly as long as some of you. In fact, I may have only played this game a day or two.. With that being said, after doing so, I had a new found joy and hope for life. I was able to put behind me the pain and suffering that had been cast over me. I was able to experience other peoples joy and happiness. I was able to see the fruits of my ""labor"". I relaxed for 5 :hillary: :hillary: :hillary: :hillary: :hillary: :hillary: :hillary: minutes to this music long enough to realize that I was going to be okay.
After coming to that realization, I turned the game off, and I went back to work. It hurt my hand like hell but I was motivated. I stopped feeling so damn sorry for myself, and I became the father I needed to be in that moment, not the weak boy I was behaving as.
Today, I am close friend with my kids mother. We don't fight, or argue, or say hurtful things to each other. We are parents, and friends.

I now have 3 kids. My third child is, wait for it, ALSO 4 YEARS OLD. The woman I am with was going through a very similar situation at the time of my own separation, and we just stumbled in to each others life unexpectedly. We have been in a relationship for a year now, and are very happy together.

Moral of the story, you never know what life holds in store for you, and if I would have given up when all the odds were stacked against me, I wouldn't be where I am today. This silly little game helped me realize that.

Thank you"

Story wise it's also good as you gradually discover what's behind the island disappearances and murders. (It is way more than cannibal monsters.)

24498,Amazing Fuckin Game. I love everything about this game. It's SO fun with friends and you can have a full on interesting journey traveling through caves fighting bosses and even building shelter to live the darkness. This game has to be one of my FAVORITE games I ever played. I am not very scared by games but the CAVES in good graphics are SCARY and creep me out. Buy this game if you have good humor with your friends and I can swear you will have the best time of your life if you keep looking at your to do list and your clues you found. Looking Forward To SONS Of The Forest.

24503,Fun game to play with friends.
24504,"I loved this game. The story felt original and can be interpreted in whatever way you want. It seems to be one of those survival games where you start off with very little information but a clear goal in mind. Your plane has crashed and you must find your now missing son in a vast Forest. As you proceed, the game unravels a twisted (and tbh thoroughly enjoyed) story about it's inhabitants.

Without giving much more away than that, The Forest is a solid game. Genuinely scary, with stressful survival moments make this game both intense and worthy of a lengthy playthrough. So often for games in the survival horror category seem to not end, or have no goal beyond just surviving as long as you can until something kills you, but this game has an ending I really enjoyed.

Singleplayer or multiplayer with friends, doesn't matter this game is really fun either way. If you're more horror-oriented, I would recommend singleplayer because obviously playing with friends makes it less scary."
24505,cannibal eat your toes
24506,"I probably finished the game about 3 times and played 6 or 7 times with different people. As you can see, it's a good game, the crafting features of the game are pretty good compared to the game's release date! The story of the game is very beautiful and ends with different endings depending on your different choices and the materials you collect. One day you will not be able to find anything wise to eat, you will eat mutant human legs, the next day you will make stew from the islanders, in some days you will cut freshwater turtles into pieces and then slide on the hills with their shells.

NOTE: flying, sliding down the slide is extremely fun. After finishing the game, it is highly recommended to turn on the cheat mode and make a water slide!"

Though building in the game is really good, it still feels kinda limiting to how much creativity the player can use in building structures. Multiplayer opens up a whole new world of fun for this game, making it go from a horror game in singleplayer to a fun experience with friends in multiplayer. Had a ton of fun with friends in multiplayer even there were some annoying bugs sometimes. Overall, I'd give it an 8.5/10."

24534,"After 35 hours and a lot of scares, I can say it is well worth the pick up. I bought it on sale because I remember watching people like Mark and Jack play it all those years ago back when I was still in school, and I thought little of it outside oh it looks like a cool and never really thought I would play it and here we are now years later. I had just finished it tonight as I am writing my review and I can say this was one of if not the best survival horror games I've played in quite a long time. Its well worth its price tag and that's not even to mention the incredible level of immersion and sound design that lends a beautiful hand to the horror of this game. I cannot wait for the sequel that is supposed to release later in 2022 I believe."

Caves arent randomized and are literally the same thing every time you go in, very few mutants inside the caves that do not respawn.
all items are always in the same spot leading to very easy game play and a lot less replayability
Unobtainable items, Specifically a gun part photo
Bad balancing and optimization for some weapons and buildings, Crossbow shoots way too high past aiming, the gun is way to underpowered for a weapon that is the hardest to obtain in the game and you cannot place most items in the church obtained through the blueprints.
You cannot change the flag on the log cart and the cart is indestructable leading to multiple flags all over the map. 
And many many more issues.
The game is great but i feel like it was far from being fully developed and required a bit more development
Some cool things they could've added to the game would be.
Skill points and perks.. The ability to level up stamina, speed and health and have certain perks like carry more logs or better bow accuracy.
More than just the 5 mutants.
a nest cave where you could fight a load ton of cannibals at once
more animals like bears or wolves.
I still very much think everyone should give this game a go. however the devs should have done more with it, Especially because its such an amazing game. i just hope the second one is a lot more developed."

The outstanding game mechanics and crafting system is smooth, the combat is smooth and interesting, and the environmental aspects are on point.

24596,"[i] TL;DR: A short and intense experience to be enjoyed both in solo and co-op, marked by its horrifying atmosphere and focus on getting closer to the story's conclusion.[/i]


I encountered The Forest often on the Steam front page. Not even once was I interested in buying this game. I never even clicked on it. Until somehow my friends and I decided to play it. I had no idea what to expect, and the game was all the better for it.


We went in fresh, eager to see what the game was about. Had I played this solo, I would likely have built a small base and gone through the game slowly and, frankly, nervously. Instead, we ran all over the island like maniacs. Maniacs who were even worse than the cannibalistic locals.


Wherever we encountered the natives we cut them down. As if that wasn't enough, we invaded their subterranean homes and slaughtered their women and children too. The mutants struggled, but their resistance was futile. No enemy could withstand the might of coordinated molotov cocktails.


We found other passengers and strange clues on these expeditions that eventually led us to the story's finish. A revelation and ending that were as freaky as the entire game up until that point. I enjoyed the entire wild ride from start to finish, but it was frankly quite horrifying."
24597,gud
24598,"Super fun to play and mess around in, especially if you have a friend to play it with. It can be a it frustrating at the start, with being killed by the cannibals and whatnot. Make sure your making armor for yourself so you wont be as easy to kill. The lighting and sounds of the game are pretty good, and i can definitely tell there's a story going on, but i admit i have not been paying attention to it. Fun game!"

24603,"Fun game with lots of things to do, making it very addictive. Not crazy about the topless female cannibals, but still enjoyed the game. Definitely worth buying!"

24618,"The Forest is a single player or co-op survival game where you seek to endure after your plane crashes on a mysterious island inhabited by tribes of cannibals. Not only that, but one of them has taken your son, and it falls to you to get him back. If you like survival/crafting gameplay, atmospheric wilderness, fast, deadly, brutal combat, uncovering mysteries with a breadcrumb trail of meticulously placed clues, and soiling your britches in a cave with one to seven of your buddies, then this game very well might be for you.

[b]The Good[/b]
[list]
  [*] The foundation upon which The Forest builds everything else good about the game is unquestionably it's atmosphere. For a low budget game originally released in 2014, the environments look really good - the surface areas are beautiful, isolated, mysterious, and wild, while the caves are dark, cavernous depths, menacing and enticing at the same time. Incredibly good ambient sound design adds to this - in the forest, wind blows and leaves rustle, while in the caves, water droplets echo through the empty spaces and unseen things scurry in the darkness beyond your vision. It is all delightlyfully immersive (until of course you spot a deer running into a tree).
  [*] Weirdly, despite AI for certain things like animals being dreadful, The Forest really nails the enemy AI. The cannibal enemies are very immersive - they stalk you, they surround you, they run when they lose the advantage and wait for you to turn your back, or come back later at night with reinforcements. I swear to God that I've even seen one pretend to be grieving a fallen companion, only to immediately come attack me when I got too close. Combined with the combat, which is simple but nicely impactful, your encounters with the enemy are really good and tense. The cannibals feel intelligent and threatening, especially early in the game. In a lot of survival games, the enemies are just an annoying hassle there to inconvenience you, and don't really create much interest aside from the objective danger they pose (i.e. you might lose some health and items) - even the venerable Minecraft has this problem. In The Forest, though, the encounters by themself are engaging and immersive.
  [*] Despite having a pretty minimal approach to storytelling, The Forest manages to present an intriguing mystery to unravel. Within the first couple hours of the game you find yourself with a lot of questions. Where is this island? Who are these tribes of cannibals? What is this weird gigantic quarry/sinkhole? As time goes on, more questions get added. Why [spoiler]are there a bunch of horrifying mutants on the island[/spoiler]? Why did the plane crash in the first place? How freaking deep does this cave system go? What the hell is this [spoiler]modern industrial facility at the bottom of the pit[/spoiler]? Now, this is where a lot of games fall short - they present intrigue, and get you to ask a bunch of questions, but never get around to answering them properly. The Forest actually manages to stick the landing - if you continue to play, you will slowly uncover the answers to more and more of these questions, eventually building to a very cool and climactic ending sequence that offers something different from the rest of the game. For an open world survival sandbox game, The Forest does story surprisingly well.
  [*] Survival mechanics are solid and not overbearing - survival systems like hunger, thirst, and energy are definitely present in the gameplay and are something you need to manage, but the systems are simplified enough that it doesn't become tedious or distract from the meat of the game which is the spelunking and exploration. They strike that nice balance of adding something without materially reducing the enjoyment of something else.
  [*] I think it is well understood now that 'good with friends' is not a very meaningful reason to recommend something since almost anything is fun if done with people you like spending time with, but I think in the case of The Forest it is justifiable, and I'll tell you why - the emotions and experiences you get while playing The Forest are in particular feelings that thrive off of a group dynamic. On the one hand, The Forest can be terrifying, and this feeling of anxiety can easily be fed and intensified by a group of people. If you are already jittery crawling around this cave in the dark, imagine how you are going to feel when your buddy ahead of you rounds a corner and starts screaming for everyone to run. On the other hand, The Forest can be busted in hilarious fashion, and it is less annoying when you have some people to laugh with. My friends and I spent several minutes after one of our log sleds began clipping through the earth and repeatedly falling from hundreds of meters in the sky back to earth trying to catch it, and fun was had by all - if that had happened to me in single player, I would have seen it as an irritating setback and likely tried to just ignore it. Friends make the good parts of this game better, and minimize the impact of the bad parts, so I highly recommend finding people to play with, even though the single player experience is solid on its own.
[/list]


[b]The Bad[/b]
[list]
  [*] This game, despite coming out of Early Access in April of 2018, is blatantly unfinished. It can still be very janky, things clip through geometry, wild animal AI is completely busted, easily reproducible bugs that have been in the game for years (like the pot duplication glitch) are still present, areas that seem like they should serve some purpose or have something in them are empty, and so forth. The company is working on a sequel now, though, so these things will likely never get fixed. As I said above, the game is fun, I recommend it, and it is in an acceptable state for the price point, particularly if you get it on sale, but I want to temper expectations - despite what it may say on the store page, this is still very much an 'early access' game and it will be forever. This is hopefully something the developers can improve upon in the sequel since they are presumably going into development with a lot of experience and resources than they had when they made this game.

This game satisfies adventurers, builders, solo fighters, team players, and horror fanatics. I love/hate the ambient sounds of each area. I love/hate the reality check on precious resources. I love/hate the philosophical and ethical issues that arise. Replay? Probably not, but not outside the realm of possibility. Sequels? I hope so! 

Have fun!"
24661,"I love this game for casual crafting/exploring. The campaign was a lot of fun and I love seeing how many days I can survive without dying. 

The game reminded me a lot of Rust, only everyone works together to beat the common enemy (mutants) instead of pillaging each other. Oh, and all your hard work doesn't get wiped off the server after like 2 weeks either, which is nice.

Overall awesome game that keeps getting updates and has tons of replay value. Try to survive for many days, try to get all the items and craft all the things, or play it as a more realistic Minecraft experience by building things. Many ways to play."

24670,"The Forest is a leader in horror survival games, the graphics take a hit compared to other games however this is more than made up for due to the enjoyment of the actual gameplay. I have play other similar titles however they are all benchmarked against The Forrest... in my mind The Forrest is still my favourite.

Dropped onto a hostile island you have to survive and solve a mystery to find a way off.... drag some friends along with you...you're going to need the support. Its a lot of fun"
24671,they fixed a lot of the bugs and if yo get in a server with others it can be fun
24672,Classic survival and possibly the best one.
24673,very fun
24674,GET
24675,A lot of trees
24676,this game is very good i guess
24677,Very good game.
24678,"It's fun. (Other than the fact that you can get so much stuff, die to a cannibal, lose all your stuff, be too lazy to go and get it back, quitting the game then uninstalling.)"
24679,please help me im turning into a murderer
24680,it amazing
24681,Buying this game is cool. Do it. You can be feasted on by hungry naked men and women.
24682,"Thank you for this survival game. 

I like how the game is made, there's a storyline that is awesome.
Weapons, building mechanics, the enemyes, everything is so perfect.
"
24683,"fun with friends, also fun solo I bet (Have not yet) but having good time with just 1 friend so I would say good game if you have like 20 bucks but it goes on sale -50% off sometimes so if you see it is I would say YOINK that."

24706,I honestly like this game. Really fun to play with friends. It is survival but it is still got that horror aspect to it. Only downside is the map maybe being a bit small and the story being relatively easy to complete but still really good game. Would recommend.
24707,UGLY CANNIBALS

You really see how your character becomes a psychotic killer trhough a journal. You get to explore the secrets of an unknown island by mowing through them naked hobos with your chainsaw
24732,Awesome terror coop survival game
24733,PANTEK
24734,"It was fun-ish, for the sale price under $10 it was a decent deal. But honestly the ending was meh and very anti-climatic. The combat system is very easy to cheese without even trying (IE They wont go in the water). Base building was very clunky and just not worth it. Sorry."

24748,"This was one of the few survival horror games I managed to finish. Playing alone tends to get slightly boring, but industrious minded folk who find joy in creating structures and have the patience to build it over hours of their playthrough might enjoy that alone.

The real fun started when I began playing multiplayer though. With more people, and playing on the hardest difficulty for the lulz, we suffered through many days and nights of terror when fighting enemies, exploration through environment and caves, as well as having fun with constructing base building, long af ziplines, and dense fortifications laden with traps against mutants and cannibals. 

The story element is a slow burn as you find pieces and pieces of clues that you put together to understand wtf is happening with the island and it was a blast to get most of the big picture and realise how messed up everything is. 

The cannibal AI is highly intruiging (sometimes janky yes, but it makes them unpredictable at times), and the design choice of making enemies climb trees, sneak, lunge, and generally act like a sneaking murder demon in the darkness led to plenty of screams from me personally. The paranoia hits when you hear noises in the distance and have frantically figure out how much of your resources you want to save and waste in confronting or running away.

Not all is peachy though. Some mechanics such as the sanity meter just seems unfinished, and other design choices (such as hidden structures) are so well hidden that the average player would never find it in their runs which is a shame. Even though most of the game is worth the exerience and polished in most aspects, it's clear to see where the gaps in their polishing were.

Overall, an amazing game and highly recommended a playthrough with friends."

I did timmy's mom dirty tho I feel bad for here, I was with timmy in the plane when we crashed. why did they not take me? timmy is my best friendi would never leave him:(."
24755,My friend tried to throw a tennis ball at me but he was holding a rock so he just smashed my face in. 10/10 Would murder cannibals with him again.
24756,"Not actually living up to the hype amongst my friends. Good game overall, but pretty monoton and short if you play through the game, even more boring when you play solo."

24773,"So far its amazing. I highly recommend it if you enjoy survival horror games or just survival games like Ark or Subnautica. One of the things that surprised me is how amazing the sound design is, it really ramps up the horror aspect. One of the only games to ever scare me and holy hell does it do that well. so far id rate it a 8/10, the crafting system is pretty iffy and a few of the gameplay elements aren't really shown to you unless you are very smart or look online for help, more specifically the patrol route system and the location of the key 3 items needed to reach the bottom of the sinkhole."

24806,"This is the best Game ever !

I tried this game not so long ago and I fell in love with it.

I started a Peaceful multiplayer server and it became more of a multiplayer survival than a horror game !

Nothing else to say, just WOW."
24807,One of the best survival game!!!
24808,cold game
24809,"I have no life, this is all i need to say."
24810,great game and runs well
24811,"It good. Fun when caveself challenge rival tribe











First playthrough, I go alone. Encounter rival tribe. They attack, I survive, progress campaign, enjoy.

Play with friends, encounter rival tribe. They attack, friends and I attack back. Win. Conquer foemen and eat them. Get hungry, more tribals attack but we are stronger tribe now. We kill, we eat, we hunt down more. Become strong warrior, big axe, chop lesser tribe of foemen - eat remains. Uglymen come. Many legs, many arms, not good. Tough beast but we kill, use hide for armor. Build large house in woods, make farm, grow crops, hunt deer. Warrior explore cave, find ferals, kill and eat ferals. Find new axe, use new axe. Good fun. Warriormen now dominant tribe, we conquer.
Good game, remind me of vacation to Boston but less killing. I enjoy :)"

I sincerely hope the one who came up with this game got the professional help he so desperately needs.
10/10 Would hand in my sanity again"
24820,I've never played a game with such flawless crafting and survival systems. Also the devs balance out horror in a truly unique experience that builds a lot of tension without relying on cheap jump scares.

24826,Fun game. Rather frustrating progression near the end to find out that I still lacked something after obtaining all the items needed to get to the last area. I felt that normal difficulty survival mechanics was too easy and once I got my bearings I regretted not playing on hard.
24827,very good game. the mutants are also hot
24828,nice
24829,Plane crashes. You get up and can't find you're son... Then you cry because you are a horrible father. Then you realise that you don't have a son and it's just a game. You eat some stuff from the plane. Get out of plane. 2 guys and 1 woman (with showed boobies) attack you. You run away... BUT THERE'S MORE OF EM. They kill you. You spawn in and... you eat some stuff from the plane. Get out. 2 guys and 1 woman (with showed boobies) attack you. You run away... BUT THERE'S MORE OF EM. They kill you.

Great game, unresponsive devs, sub-par object render distance, no access to tweaking anything. I would still be playing if I could actually make it look good."

24854,"Amazing game that's infinitely playable; I've come back to this game after finishing it time and time again - and it's even better multiplayer. Even after replaying it so many times, it's still just as scary as when you run through the first time.
The AI is deliberately confusing, which makes the game so frustrating but so enjoyable, and the snippets of story you pick up from photos and experiences are incredible. The 'campaign' as it were, is frankly both terrifying and addictive.
There are definitely some aspects of this game I would change, and things I think will be rectified in the new game Sons of the Forest, but as it is, it's a wonderful game and I cannot recommend it enough."

24858,"Fantastic game. Loved playing through with my friends. I loved the story and general survival vibe. Somethings were a little frustrating about the game like trying to make a base and always getting griefed by the cannibals but that's just part of the game really. 
The world is a beautiful one with lots of details and places to explore. Both full of mystery and scares mixed with a lovely flavouring of beauty in the natural landscape of the game. 
There is lots more to be done with this game and plenty of new things that can be added. I'm sure that Sons of the Forest will capitalise on building off what is already a fantastic game. If you love horror and some survival and exploration especially with your buddies then I cannot say enough that you really should give this game a spin.

Love it!"
24859,Fun to play with fwiends
24860,It's a great survival game with a fairly interesting story. the building can be a bit buggy sometimes and its a bit grindy but it's very fun to play through with friends

You can play with out any drama where you are pretty much just exploring with out any danger, Then medium difficulty where you get attacked every now and then, then there is just Barbaric where you get attacked pretty much non stop!!!!

24867,"An incredibly janky and finicky survival game and a nightmare to try to build in, The Forest is unashamedly a single-minded vehicle for it's incredibly well executed AI and jump-at-every-noise atmosphere. Everything else rides in the back. While I'm frequently frustrated by bugs or UI decisions, that feeling is outweighed by the things this game does best. If the sequel's a more polished, well rounded survival experience I could easily see myself sinking a lot of time into it."
24868,Fun.
24869,"its a really good game, i love the story line. nut i dont understand why they chose cannibals or that there was a experiment in the mountains and that there is a giant demon child that you have to kill to save your son that must of survived a plane crash and was stolen by another human saying its the red cannibal and that there are giant mutants in a cave with a bloody katana inside and that there is also giant blue cannibals and other fat orange cannibals that can jump so high"

I explored the caves and the mountains and the whole map finding things.  I hope they make another without giving away the ending...it is all set up for another game.  The changes of progress in the game are really felt because you struggle and struggle then you get somewhere and you are like yesssss this game is amazing.  Well done - this is a terrific game.

24967,"The Forest is a beautifully immersive survival game that expertly lures you into a false sense of security, executing the Lovecraftian horror elements with perfect timing and precision. Under the base survival mechanic lies a cryptic, thought provoking story line that consistently plays on mystery, and ends on morally macabre decisions.

The world has been presented in such a way, that you WANT to explore. You WANT to venture to the deep, dark morbidness because the game rewards you for doing so.

If you love horror - this game is for you!.
If you don't love horror - Play multiplayer - Much less scary when you're with friends."

And there are random 3rd person animations. So if you click a ladder for instance, you'll be floating behind your character as he climbs the ladder. It's super frustrating and ruins the experience."

The second part is exploring the caves and trying to solve the mystery of what happened to the little boy that was taken after your plane crashed.  I'm doing well on the base building and setting it up.  Having a little bit of trouble with the other part.
I guess I should mention that the cannibals are unpredictable, except when they have far superior numbers, 
then you will be attacked.  The Mutants can be avoided but will attack if you get close to them.  It's also good to have more then one base to fall back to.  It's an enjoyable game though."

---{ Review Summary }---
To put it simply. This game is amazing. I remember when it first released and how choppy it was but the gameplay was there and made it fun. The story is completed along with multiple endings which is worth playing both sides. The horror aspect of it is perfect, especially if you know anything about the AI which is something I could write a book on because this game has probably the best AI in any game I have ever played.

My friends and I always find ourselves coming back despite if its been weeks, months, or even a year. We always come back to play and when we do, its either we beat the game again or we just binge-play for hours among hours. I cannot wait for the sequel to release and to play that for many more hours to come."

25046,"The game is fun to mess around in, but a lot of  mechanics are clunky. Stamina runs out way too easily. For such a large map, with big caves, traversing is a chore when even descending a rope drains your stamina. The enemy AI is not great. They get stuck on rocks, run around in circles, walk into water and die way too often. This ruins immersion and downplays the horror aspect a lot. Building anything requires way too many logs where I couldn't care to build anything cool due to the time needed to farm logs. The in-game map lacks any detail, and the cave map is quite useless beyond a rough idea of where the caves are.

There is a story, but you have to piece it together based on items you find, walking sim style, which doesn't do justice to the story at all.

The game doesn't tell you what items you require for the endgame. The path to the endgame cave is super long, and takes forever to get out if you realize you are missing something or need to stock up on resources before the final boss. 

Once the novelty wears off, the game is just unpolished. It still does a lot of stuff right and is a fun time if you keep your expectations tempered."

"
25052,very fun and scary game. i love the theme of the game and how you need to save Timmy. love how the cannibals get stronger and stronger after each day. the only thing i always get scared of is the bats in and outside the caves.
25053,"Setting up a dedicated server can be a headache but after several hours of troubleshooting I got mine working. There are some bugs in the game that are quite strange, such as the Old Pot duplication glitch that happens if you let the fire go out while you have a pot on it. Do not play this game expecting a flawless experience. That said, it's a nice take on survive 'em ups; I appreciate the environment, the little objectives, the nice surprises in the game world (no spoilers), the crafting system/interface, and so forth. I would recommend this game to fans of the genre who have the patience for less polished titles."

25142,Great game
25143,AMAZING!
25144,"Pros:
-Gameplay is pretty damn fun from the start. It is challenging and enjoyable to learn things as you go along.
-Enemies are interesting and relentless
-Game has come a long way since launch. Gotta respect the work.
-Visuals are nice. All environments are interesting to explore.
-Obviously, one of those games that need people to play with
-Crafting is fun and nice to try out

Cons:
-Building in the game is sort of terrible. There are lots of limitations and odd rotations. 
-Feels like they added a lot to the game and tried to throw it all together. 
-Only one kind of map. No random generated maps. Kinda just kills the idea of replaying.
-Can be a bit buggy and higher difficulties are stupid. Can't really build anything when enemies come every 5 min or less. 
-Combat is sort of awkward. Hitboxes are a little odd as well.
-Unfortunately, I have to compare something like this to Valheim since it seems sort of similar in ideas. Valheim is much better in content and gameplay."

25161,This is a very engaging game because of how challenging it is!
25162,"Game has quite a bit of jank to it, probably wouldn't recommend picking it up at full price.

Overly esoteric in its design, as if it expects you to look up a wiki to know what to do. Minecraft suffers from this as well - the sort of thing where everyone already just sort of 'knows' how the game works and what to do. Game really should teach you more.

Other than that it's an indie game with a pedigree, an interesting setting, VR 'support' if you can call it that, and is best played with some mates. Pick it up when it's on a sale but I would honestly give this a pass if I were buying it today at full price."

25200,"Me and my friend found it really fun to play, never found that we weren't doing something throughout the whole game. The experience allowed for a scary and enjoyable experience that improved my experience. Graphics are a bit janky but that doesn't matter because there are many other elements to improve the atmosphere. Looking forward to the sequel."

25208,"A very nice game, especially when you realise it was made by such a small team. Story is very interesting and the main point of the game.

Gameplay is nice too and even better if you have friends to play it with.

I reccomend buying it at a discount as there is one very often."
25209,Treehouse :D
25210,Good. Similar to the game Green Hell. Not sure which one came first. Dont like the wandering around until you find the next thing you need aspect of it though. But story was very cool. Play with friends not solo

25221,"wasted 15 pounds and half hour for the game not to let me join anyone with ""could not join steam lobby"" fix this steam ffs"
25222,"I love playing this game. The survival, concepts and story are very neat and have a realistic feel to them. The quality and sounds aspect of the game make the game even better as they give the feel of actually being on the island.

The only thing that could be improved is the VR support. There is no controls section for you to check the key bindings, which can make some things hard to figure out. For example: I had to google how to jump not knowing that you would have to push the right joystick up. Personally I don't really like that because its the same joystick as looking around which makes jumping in VR difficult without your character turning around."
25223,"Fantastic game. Both single and multiplayer.

I got this game purely because I said I'd play it with my boyfriend but def worth it. Honestly not that terrifying once you get used to it. The bat jumpscare noises will always get me though."
25224,pretty fun game when playing with friends
25225,"this might be the most addicting game I have ever played
the best part is that time doesn't fly while you are playing it
get this game!"

25231,yes
25232,Very fun
25233,I have nightmares mixed with sexual desires about this game
25234,"i got my booty ate by a black man, 10/10 would play again"
25235,SAMMEE
25236,"If you love base building games, the further you get into the game the more difficult it gets. This is a game for you. I would say this game is Similar to Ark Survival, and Subnautica. The game I love because you dont have to progress and it makes for a fun camping game, but only scardy cats do that. Alright so pretty much I highly reccemond this game because it took me about 45 hours to beat, with youtube help. For the money you spend for this game its worth it."
25237,i tried to kill my son but i failed

25244,"THIS gAmE... Will put some friggin hair on your chest... EVEN FOR THE LADIES. Never did I ever imagine in all my years of living (21) that I would think to come across a naked lady and be AFRAID!!! This game knows how to mess with you, challenge you, and reward you. You will want to grind this game with friends and find your lost son timmy and put a friggin axe to the skull of whatever cannibal comes across you. Get this game if you are a sigma and want to play a real survival game."
25245,yes
25246,"its good for if you wanna be scared or have a laugh with friends
"
25247,10/10 would cannibalise to survive again
25248," A really fun game to play solo or with friends. If you like survival games and horror games, look no further than this game where you crash land on an island full of cannibals and have to build a base, hunt for food and fight off or run away from endless patrolling cannibals.

But wait! There's more sinister things to discover as you play..."
25249,You will get a lot of laughs if you play with your friends and it is a simple yet amazing game at the same time with many things you can go out and do and many things you can find.
25250,harasho
25251,fun

25255,it good
25256,Can cut up body parts. GOOD

Couldn't give a toss about the story at this point."
25296,very good game fun with friends and randoms lots to do and explore
25297,"if your into scary fucking caves, having the only music be at the end of the game or in cassette tapes that have absolute bangers, chopping and killing over hundreds of cannibals that could jump at you at any moment with a katana. and remembering like in every game where you are trying to find your son but you end up building forts and farming for wetsuts this is the game for you 

also you will love cutting trees

25299,Within our first ten days on the island we had already slaughtered dozens of natives and started collecting their bones to make furniture with. This game turns you into a psychopath.

25308,"The best survival game I've ever played.  9/10

Being a big fan of horror and a casual fan of survival games this game exceeded my expectations. There being a story had most of my interest but the aspect of survival into the discovery of the story kept me pushing forward towards a goal rather than just becoming over powered. Constant discovery of game play enhancing items and lore items with an end game truly make this game stand out from the rest. I consider this more of a story game with survival game play. 
 
That being said, one of the big perks of this game is it can be played as just a survival game alone or with 8 other people but in my opinion it would have been nice to have other hostile forces such as bears, cougars or snakes and a fishing pole mechanic would have been nice as well, basically deeper survival mechanics. If this were just a survival game without its story, it could still hold its ground due to the great crafting options, craftable item placements and dynamic AI but could also come across as limiting to those with minor nitpicks. still as stated before, the best survival game I've ever played."
25309,"fun game to play with friends 
"
25310,"shanice was scary

The fighting mechanics are a bit sloppy, but overall I really love this game. It can be a little scary at times, I love it! I don't normally become scared with a game, but this game is just amazing. I totally recommend this for other people, it's a wonderful game with an amazing story-line and an awesome idea tied to it."
25318,baller

25325,great game with mates
25326,"Pretty fun, but it needs more. It gets really repetitive and has hardly any replayability. Needs more to make it fun to replay."
25327,treee fall on freind funny
25328,The game is very good in my opinion once you get an upper hand over the cannibals and is extremely fun with friends
25329,"I bought this in 2017 and I am still playing in 2022, can't wait for the next installment."

25342,"10/10 would play again, amazing story, mixed with the survival aspect made this one hard to top, worth every penny i payed for this game."
25343,"This game saved my life.

I am 38.

My ex-wife and I have a daughter together, and adopted our son together. They are now both 4 years old.

When we were going through our separation, I found myself lost and miserable. I was self destructive. I got so mad one day from everything spiraling out of my control that I punched some concrete in a moment of overwhelming emotion. That caused me to break my 5th metacarpal in my right hand... my working hand... my games hand.. the hand that I held and carried my children to bed with.. The hand I desperately needed to make sure I could continue to provide.

After learning of the severity of my self-inflicted damage, I was borderline suicidal. Keep in mind that just a few months before this, I was the happiest man with no history of depression or anxiety. I have never had fits of rage, or been one to break down and cry, but I was in a low spot that just really buried me from being able to see the light on the other side.

Having nothing better to do, I searched for a game I could play, ONE HANDED while I recovered. I somehow stumbled upon this game and read some of the reviews. I decided that it had to be worth a shot... I must admit, I didn't beat the game, or play nearly as long as some of you. In fact, I may have only played this game a day or two.. With that being said, after doing so, I had a new found joy and hope for life. I was able to put behind me the pain and suffering that had been cast over me. I was able to experience other peoples joy and happiness. I was able to see the fruits of my ""labor"". I relaxed for 5 :hillary: :hillary: :hillary: :hillary: :hillary: :hillary: :hillary: minutes to this music long enough to realize that I was going to be okay.
After coming to that realization, I turned the game off, and I went back to work. It hurt my hand like hell but I was motivated. I stopped feeling so damn sorry for myself, and I became the father I needed to be in that moment, not the weak boy I was behaving as.
Today, I am close friend with my kids mother. We don't fight, or argue, or say hurtful things to each other. We are parents, and friends.

I now have 3 kids. My third child is, wait for it, ALSO 4 YEARS OLD. The woman I am with was going through a very similar situation at the time of my own separation, and we just stumbled in to each others life unexpectedly. We have been in a relationship for a year now, and are very happy together.

Moral of the story, you never know what life holds in store for you, and if I would have given up when all the odds were stacked against me, I wouldn't be where I am today. This silly little game helped me realize that.

Thank you"

25391,"Amazing game to play with friends. Would still be fun playing solo but I enjoyed the multiplayer aspect a lot more. Story at the end of the game made everything worth it, can't wait for the 2nd one to come out"
25392,AYO YOU EATIN HIS ASS
25393,A real terifiying joyride for the Lads and I
25394,"The forest is an amazing and deep game. It has a very interesting story. The basic story is, your a survival expert who was enjoying a flight with his son, Timmy. Then your plane runs into some turbulence and your plane goes down. Than you wake up to find that your son is gone, and your stranded on a large and undiscovered island. After exploring for a bit, you find a village. Turns out the island is not undiscovered. There are a bunch of hostile native tribes. Than you get F***ed by the natives. THE END.
"
25395,Excellent game! makes you think on how to survive plus not be hunted by the critters. Story line takes a while to get into but map is huge with caverns and caves to explore and survive.

25481,"This game is very entertaining and caters very well to people who like complex survival games. This game pretty much has it all from melee and ranged combat, to cutting down trees and building survival shelters or a fortress on the mountain. There are many elements in the game that make it impossible to experience boredom in any play through and similarly to Minecraft there is an optional ending. This means you can continue to build your Island and survive, or you can speedrun to the end in an hour. Overall I believe this game is great considering it also offers coop gameplay which makes base building a lot easier and taking on caves a little more interesting."

25525,Game crashed as we got into a mode after death and lost all our progress. After spending a lot of time getting items it there was just no way to get them back. Played a good amount of survival games and at least you cant get stuck in a death state behind locked gated content and lose it all to a crash.

25529,this game is fun and intriguing all on its own a very fun and  you'll forget how much time has passed
25530,"Loved this game. Open world where cannibals roam the island trying to kill you every chance they get. Being able to build bases to help ward of the cannibals as well as finding interesting ways to kill them. This game provides hours of fun. Not only that, the overall plot to this game is awesome as well. The story is sprinkled through the game and is not fully linear so it gives you a lot of freedom. The way the game ends is great, wrapping up the this game's plot with a nice little bow and hinting at a sequel. I would highly recommend this game!"

There's random enemies you can find around that can give some challenge to the game, and there is a story you can unfold or ignore. In addition, base building is good, but quite grindy if you want a bigger base.

(SPOILER) 
chose to go with the good ending where timmy remains dead, but you save the other plane passengers which allows you to stay on the island. we also know the other ending, but I think this ending gives the opportunity to even continue with what you've created or built before you found timmy, but this game has been really fun and I honestly can't wait for the sequel to come out."

25710,"Pros-
The Story- This is a huge element that Minecraft is really missing. There is little to no lore in Minecraft or Rust for that matter. The Ender Dragon only has the meaning the player applies to it. While this is fine it doesn‚Äôt keep the imagination and causes the game to become kind of stale because it doesn‚Äôt create a need to explore map areas for special items. The Forest does not fall into this trap. The story starts the gameplay and helps provide a reason to explore the whole area. 
The game begins with a plane crash which sets up a survival situation. The main character was traveling with his son who has wandered off with other survivors from the crash site before the protagonist awakes in the wreckage. This missing child is what drives the story in The Forest. Another big advantage to the story of The Forest is that it is not forced upon the player. Only the beginning is mandatory. After this the only things compelling you to follow the story is your own morbid curiosity and/or your empathy for your son and survivors as well as some snide achievements from the developer. However, you‚Äôre going to want to follow the story. It is exceptionally entertaining, and the atmosphere really helps sell a decent narrative experience. While exploring the vast wilderness you soon learn that you are not the first visitor to the Peninsula. As you gather the remnants of other inhabitants you slowly learn the story behind the fleshy abominations that stalk the wilderness. 

The gameplay- Beyond the story the gameplay is excellent. There are many games in this genre which try to go for ultra-realism in response to the fantasy worlds of Minecraft, Terarria or No Man‚Äôs Sky. The Forest hits right smack dab in the middle of these two takes on the genre. The graphics are not cartoonish. Most of the game is sensible. There are no magic tomes or spaceships to gather an endless amount of resources for. You do not have to travel to another dimension or planet to get some new, undiscovered resource. On the other end you are not trying to gather 12 different things just to make a container that will hold your water. There is little in the way of creating an economically functional homestead because cannibals do not care for trade. You are not building a campsite for your survival. 
Skill in base building is not necessarily an architectural trial where you are trying to get every little detail perfect. It is not an exercise in creating an automated production facility to trade large amounts of items with NPCs or other players. Your base‚Äôs quality is mostly measured in its ability to defend your homestead and the effectiveness of your organizational structure for storing your resources. The base building mechanics are fluid. You are given several basic premade structures and options for custom buildings. This allows for you to choose how you want to approach the story. Are you going to hold up in an intricately designed fortress and slowly gather a good number of resources to tackle the story in a few large excursions into the interior of the Peninsula or are you going to traverse the island and build a series of small bases at key locations on the map tackle the story area by area? Are you going to do a little bit of both? All of these are considerations to be addressed as you are beginning playing. 

The Enemy A.I.- The Forest has a stellar AI system. The enemies on the map evolve as you do. They have a collective personality, and this creates very compelling combat. Initially many of the cannibalistic inhabitants of the island are neutral towards you. Your actions with the functionally sane Cannibals dictates how they respond to you. If you are aggressive, they will become aggressive earlier in the game. If you are stealthy or diplomatic, they will leave you alone for a while. In addition, the natives frequently run patrol routes from their camps to specific geographical areas on the map.  If you are discovered in an area by the aboriginals, they will send out raids against you if they are hostile. There is also a hierarchy to the forces arrayed against you as well. Cowmen and Armseys act as tanks or assault vehicles for the cannibals. Virginias are a kind of personnel carrier for the freakish abominations. The Cannibals are a kind of foot soldier. They use tactics against you. They will try to surround you then rush you. They may engage in a kind of one-on-one honor combat to test you. 
I would like to note that there are strategy games that would wish to have an AI this advanced. The A.I. adapts and evolves and it can make the game immensely entertaining. You are not handicapped in any way. The cannibals in this game do not get more resources. They do not get attack of defense buffs or any special units like they do in strategy game. The AI gets no special privileges. It makes the combat a true test of wills where you feel a legitimate sense of accomplishment for successful raids, ambushes, or intelligently engineered defense perimeters. I would highly recommend the developers of Total War, AOE, Starcraft or even Paradox games to get into contact with The Forest‚Äôs developers and ask them how they created such a dynamic and challenging A.I.

Cons
Lack of resources- As stated above I think one of the best parts of this game is the pacing and the gameplay. It‚Äôs not a huge grind to build the perfect base. All this being said I think there were some missed opportunities. In most survival situations clay is a commonly used resource for shelter building and storage creation. I think this game really missed an opportunity to make clay storage containers and structures. Currently there is only one or two storage options for clean water in the game and clap pots would be a welcome addition. I would have also liked to have created clay house by a river junction. There is also a lack of options when it comes to building with pelts of hunted animals. Most of the animal pelts are only really used to create storage pouches. I think there was a miss opportunity to create a yurt in the plains area of the island with animal hides. 
Limited weapons and combat options for the player- While the AI is stellar and leads to many unique combat experiences the options for defending yourself are limited. There are few one-handed weapons. Most of the melee weapons are two handed. There is no shield even though you can collect turtle shells as an item. Currently the turtle shell only has two uses. A turtle shield could have easily and sensibly been implemented into the combat. I would have also liked a crafted blade option. A stone knife could have been added to the game and would have been a welcome addition to crafting and combat. There is also only one firearm in the game. A few firearms would not hurt the game play. I think a bolt action and a revolver would be a welcome addition and would not give the player too much power especially if ammo was rare on the map. 
The game includes too many impractical traps. Many of these traps are only useful in a handful of situations. There are a few useful ones such as the leaf trap. I think a rock or boulder trap would have been a better option than some of the other traps due to the dynamic and elevated terrain of The Peninsula. Lastly, I would have liked combat opportunities to clear certain areas on the map of natives. You can kind of do this by placing out totems and effigies but it‚Äôs not an exact science and they are not guarantees what you won‚Äôt be raided on your territory during a midnight resource run. An option to clear out a few select areas of natives would also add to the multiplayer experience because it focuses the more combat oriented players on a server on the common enemy and not onto other base building focused players. The players on a server could organize little 3-man war parties to go raid the natives and freaks and take control of territory and resources.

25730,"This game is hella fun, from its exploration, to the storyline. Playing multiplayer is actually a really good experience, as long as its with friends, as you could end up with modders in your game in a public session. So private is the way to go, the game could be tense, especially in caves, but its enjoyable at the end of the day."

25770,"tree bad 
"
25771,pre fun multiplayer for when u got no games to play
25772,"This game is garbage. In the half an hour I played it I encountered at least fifty bugs. I normally spend at least and hour and a half before returning a game, (so as to give it a fair chance) and while I almost never return games, I couldn't even play this for an hour. Its just so boring and pointless. And don't even get me started on the ai. People says its really good, but when I found the enemies they kept running into rocks and trees. Couldn't even get to me. Avoid this game."

25784,it is amazing
25785,best game very fun with friends
25786,"An outlier in survival games.

The AI derpy at times has a unique curiosity towards you that you will not see in a zombie game. They eat you but it's endearing.

The game has a story that doesn't stuff itself down your throat. It's just there, you stumble into it sometimes, you hit a point where you are crashing into the story faster than you crashed into an island. And then the game is done and you could do more but probably not feel the need.

BERRY POUCH OP!
That means nothing in any other game."

25874,"This is a fun survival game. There is a lot of flexibility for gathering resources, building, crafting, etc. Building fortresses are fun and expansive.

25877,Very fun and a little scary game
25878,"good game

25879,Amazing game with a fine story and very detailed but not too complex basics and mechanics for survival. You can basically finish it in 5 hours unless you want to explore more about it. Graphics maybe cannot really catch up to the latest games but it's still pretty nice for the eyes. It contains constant pressure because cannibals and mutants can attack you at any time. Can't wait to see the sequel of it with upgraded building options and season changes. This is definitely a must play game for all people who are fans of survival - horror genre.
25880,played this game for about 3 hours and I saw that I got an achievement for surviving the first night. How did 20 percent of people not survive. Just shows im better so 10/10 game

also fix your shitty noclip glitch"
25900,"Played this game a few hours with a friend and a bit on the single player , tough survival truly but a fun experience. Best to be played with a squad of 4 members , members must split up into 2 teams of hunters and gathers , names imply the roles , building must be done together and never be split up for too long , stick together and you will ensure your survival"
25901,d
25902,game is meh. grapichs are a bit out-dated but gameplay wise its pretty good. so its a decent MEHING. also you eat other people which makes you a cannibal so thats VERY COOL
25903,"fuck my friend
"
25904,So far this game is everything a survival game should be... It's a great experience with friends
25905,very fun game best with friends
25906,"WP, more improvement"
25907,"The feelings that you get when you find yourself barely alive after the airplane crash are priceless. Vulnerability and fear force you to explore, craft, and defend yourself against the unknown. Then, once you get to know the unknown, you feel yourself even more vulnerable and desperate, and yet eager to resist and survive. And this is why I want to recommend this game.

However, it has its flaws that will make your journey quite bumpy:
- I expected to have more plot hints that will make my exploration more determined and connected
- at times, the AI acted in an unpredictable and glitchy way which also ruined the moment

26001,"pro: cool
con: none"
26002,very cool
26003,"The game is really good. The plot is kind of weird but super creative. The AI doesnt even seem like AI - they make the illusion of actual speechless cannibals wondering what kind of living organism you are; They get into a safe distance from which they can observe you and even follow you to your base and call backup. The construction in this game is brilliant - so are the graphics. But sometimes, the game gets buggy.

26009,"This game is extremely fun. The crafting is great, its diverse and complex but not in a confusing or difficult way. Just makes you think a little is all. The combat too can be seemingly overwhelming but fear not it does get easier the better things you find or build. The world looks great too, graphics are very nice. The plot is a very good story and doesn't feel choppy or forgettable considering you are free to the play the game as you wish. My brother and i played this nonstop and loved every minute of it and felt very accomplished once we beat it. I highly recommend play this game because the sequel to this comes out soon!"

26031,Looking for a game where you are dropped in and left to your devices to literally just figure it out? This is the game for you. Awesome crafting mechanic and pretty awesome story line. This game is an absolutely amazing bang for your buck. Get it.
26032,"Very well made game, looks good even now on max graphics, rafts are a little buggy tho but no other bugs found so far"
26033,"This is a fun game to play alone or with friends. Playing alone gives it a bit more of a scary feel and makes it harder which i like, but playing with friends is so much more fun because it makes it fun and silly with a ton of jobs to get done and glitches to laugh at. if you are looking for a perfect game you will be disappointed but the glitches are what make it so fun and I can't wait for the 2nd game."

26067,great game
26068,"Fun with friends. It is an Indie game so expect poor optimization and bugs. I would recommend this game to anyone, the survival aspect of the game is not that major, it is mostly incorporated into the base building where you need to gather tons of material. But otherwise it is not really that focused on it's survival niche. Cool and quite linear story but that is fine."

26090,"First off - I've played this a few years back and have come back to it recently to play with my kids. Single player is pretty stable though we're seeing lots of bugs in multiplayer.

That said, the game is fantastically playable. The enemy AI is well done and there are some truly creepy moments I've experienced in this game. Co-op truly feels necessary, and grouping up to defeat enemies or just for mutual defense addresses the feel of the game - safety in numbers.

There's so much that can be said for the game, but I recommend you experience it for yourself."

26139,"The nameless and silent hero is what you are. The ruthless, cold and determined survivor. Watch to see if you can escape the Forest's clutches. The cannibalistic beasts that look into you from the darkness of each passing night. A land outstretching over jagged stone, complimenting the softness and gentle nature of deep lakes and rushing rivers. Over rock, dirt, branch and tree, the plethora of all the creeps and crawls and runs through the trees awaits you, the sole survivor of a devastating plane crash. 

Will you survive? 
The choice is yours, silent hero."
26140,Build a base for seven days survive. Friends join. Friends cutting trees. The trees fell to the base. Repeat.
26141,Doesn't work with multiple monitors unless you go to an amount of extra effort you really shouldn't have to. You should just play a game where you can turn left without getting shunted to a different window
26142,"The atmosphere of the forest is enough to scare me even when I'm playing on peaceful mode and there's no enemies to worry about. Just having effigies respawn fills me with a chill, because it reminds me that I don't entirely know what's going on in the woods beyond my cute little cabin. Definitely the most fun with friends, but a great experience alone as well."

Building in this game was one of my favorite parts with a lot of possible approaches to building a base. Getting new weapons and gear by crafting or exploring was really fun. Looking forward to the second game of the franchise."

26231,"Good jump scares, good story for horror fans, and nice AI hunting.  The inventory / crafting system is innovative, but sometimes clunky and not intuitive.  Need better instructions for simpletons like myself to better get used to item slot use.  Overall a unique and fun experience.  Multiplayer is much better than single player in terms of playing the game.  Lastly, the need for setting up a dedicated server is real, because if you are playing with friends the save will be on someone's local."

26279,"Im not a huge fan of difficult survival games, but this one seemed good at the start, until you realize you miss melee hits 30-60% of the time and the cannibals never let you rest and often in groups of 6+. So you find yourself in a very difficult survival game, not far from the likes of dark souls, and you finally accept that. Come a few hours of playtime and you now have either been randomly kicked from the game or manually exited. It does not matter if you saved or not cuz your data gets lost anyway with no seemable way to recover it. google, steam, and other forums have no working solutions. So.... Buy at your own risk."

26341,"The Forest Is a great open world survival with fun features such as in depth caves with a story line and items inside to help you. What I find really cool is that you do not NEED to go into the caves or pay any interest to the story line and you can just explore, build or just kill. 

I will say there are still bugs in the game that I wish were fixed such as the item called ""old pot"" Whenever trying to heat up water 50% of the time it wouldn't work and it would just duplicate the pot. This isn't actually useful as you can only hold one pot and that it doesn't boil your water making me die of thirst. Another issue is some of the multiplayer. I played with a friend and found a few bugs such as all the old parts did not spawn for me but spawned for my friend. I could not hunt fish if my friend was not with me otherwise they would not spawn and that's it to be honest.

But that's just small bugs and does not really effect much of the gameplay. I still really enjoyed the game and really recommend it. I must say the story was really interesting and cannot wait for the second game.

"
26342,"I should not have put this off for as long as I did. But some part of me is glad to wait until about a week ago when I picked this game up. Now I cant wait until May 2022 to snag the 2nd game coming out. This was one hell of a ride.

Played through nearly the whole thing without looking up a single thing on any wiki site or help videos. Had to near the end cause we got stuck and instead of spending the next several hours looking through every single thing we just took a peak at the overworld map and one of the caves along with an odd bug with the end boss but otherwise this game was great to play. 8/10 (-2 just bugs and some issues finding key elements)

Go and get this game if you haven't already , you wont regret it.

Cant wait for the 2nd story."

26345,"One Piece takes place in an alternate world where pirates rule the seas and anything can happen. Gold Roger was the Pirate King who had fame, fortune, and power. But when he was captured he was sentenced to be executed. On the day he was executed he revealed his One Piece treasure is hidden somewhere at The Grand Line.

This made people set sail and try to hunt down the One Piece treasure. Many have failed and never found the location of it. But over the years it's drawn attention and formations on hundreds of Pirate groups who seek the title of Pirate King. The whole world has entered the Golden Era of Pirates.

On one island lived a boy named Luffy, who is friends with a pirate named Captain Shanks. He looks up to Shanks as a hero. And would do anything to be part of his crew. But he was too young to become a pirate or part of any crew. One day Luffy encountered the Devil Fruit. He ate it and obtain the power the fruit hold. It gave him the ability to stretch with a body made of rubber. But once you eat the Devil's Fruit, you're cursed with the powers forever. And can never be able to swim again. After almost drowning in the water, his friend Shanks saved his life. As Shanks departs with his crew, he gave Luffy his prized straw hat. He told him to keep it with him, until they meet again. While Luffy was left feeling sad but honored at the same time. And his new destiny in life, will be to start up his own pirate crew, go to the Grand Line, find the One Piece treasure, to become the new Pirate King.

A few years later, Luffy starts his quest to find him some friends for his pirate crew. Throughout the series, he'll find new lands, new allies, treasure, danger, and plenty of villains to face off. But with some faith and the powers of the Devil's Fruit. Luffy will sure to succeed his goal in becoming the Greatest Pirate that ever lived.

Comic made back in the late 90s, and the anime series has been around since the earlier days of SpongeBob. I first heard of it when it came on the FoxBox back in late 2004. I wasn't entirely into many anime back then. And I never saw the English Dub of the series, as I found it to be an OK series. After reading on the internet that the dub is heavily edited and nothing like the original. I grew interest on how good it is. I read the first volume of the Manga series. And liked how the story was going.

Wasn't until January 2007, when I finally start to check out the Anime. Only I viewed the episodes that are subtitled, uncut, and uncensored. And I grew to love it. The animation is very well done, it's funny, it's action packed, and it's dramatic sometimes. I don't even consider it a kid's cartoon, when it's more aimed to teenagers. But with an interesting cast of characters, and over a hundred secondary/miscellaneous characters. One Piece is indeed a great Anime next to Case Closed, Naurto, & other ongoing series.

The reason why it's very underrated was because of 4Kids being the first company to distribute the anime. Which they edited and censored a lot. And many flaws in the dubbing. Such as voices that don't suit the characters' personalities. Too many pirate accents and catch-phrases that get old instantly. All the violence, blood, alchol, drugs, and nudity were altered and removed. All the weapons were altered to look harmless. 4Kids spent more time edditting than spending time on the scripts. Plus a lot of filler and small episodes were removed. And most of them were too important to take out in the series.

The good thing is 4kids no longer owns rights to One Piece. I knew they would drop it, because they did a poor job in introducing the series to English speaking countries.

With over 300 episodes, I can tell that One Piece is really big in Japan. I've seen all the current episodes. And can't get enough of it.

So those who like their Anime uncut, should highly recommend seeing One Piece uncut by fan subs or Funimation's release on the series."

It is very much similar to Minecraft, but more hard and alot realistic. There are some down side with frames and the internet. Me and some other friends had the same issue when we entered a cave we could see through and could see the cannibals. To fix this we just closed the game and rejoined.

26401,"As a survival game, this one misses the mark, as a building game, this one leaves something to be desired, and as a horror game, its far too disjointed. This game could have been great, if the story line was done in a better manner, instead the only way to ""beat the game"" is by searching every corner of the cave system to find the items needed. It was long, boring and finally required looking up from other gamers what I was missing.  I spent lots of time with this game, but not because it was particularly fun or entertaining - it was due to a lack of information on gameplay, a terrible save-game system that potentially makes you re-do tons of work, and because I was determined to ""beat it"". The gameplay and combat system was pretty bad as well. You never really grow as a character and run around hulking on enemies, you just kind of learn some better tactics. Despite the huge effort and time with this game, the pay-off was far from worth it with the crappy and confusing ending."

I could eat their limbs or i could get more bones from their bodies. So from this game I have become a more sane person so I don't have to do this in real life.

26438,It's a great game to play when you need to kill some time. It's relaxing and intense at the same time. Do you guys feel the Minecraft vibes? lol

26442,It gud.
26443,just yes
26444,"Not just a good survival game, but also an excellent horror game. The caves are genuinely terrifying on your first go-through. It may have a few bugs, but none of them take away from the game's quality and fun! I mean, who doesn't wanna watch a log sled go flying after you accidentally drop a dead body on it?

10/10. Moths my Titty."
26445,peed my pants in the first 4 seconds while playing this in vr mode 11/10
26446,its fun
26447,pretty fun game but playing alone sucks would recommend if u have friends XD
26448,This is a good first time survival horror game for anyone. It is an excellent game to play with a group of friends and it even has an okay story.
26449,"it really fun, and  makes me poo poo me self"
26450,"VERY GOOD

26455,Good if you wanna get jumped by titty monsters
26456,good
26457,"The game is pretty fun but there are glitches that break immersion, like: items randomly popping into the air, tumbling bush branches after game load. Also items respawn after some time, including key items like map and compass. You shoot bone arrows but remove wooden ones from the dead body. Building is not working well, its hard to build seamlessly. I thought its beta but its not. Not cool"
26458,"If survival craft is your go to, then this game is for you. it can be very spooky at times and its just fun to mess with the locals. 8.5/10"
26459,"This game is very fun, especially in VR. Great gameplay and story, extremely fun and funny with friends. Combat could be better when playing on a PC but it is really good when playing VR. I would recommend this game 100% although I would say it is better in VR it feels like it was made for VR."
26460,A game where there are minor benefits to cannibalism. 10/10
26461,"I really enjoyed this game play. I played with many of my friends and we had a great funny, memorable and straight out wild fun time. The game seems very empty at first but when you start to explore the game really shines. There is a lot scary creatures in the game, and a lot of deadly creatures. The game is very worth the time and money if you have friends that are into story survival games. This is one of the best multiplayer story games I have ever played or seen. Thank you for my Ted Talk"
26462,"Within my first few nights of the game, I had a naked lady run at me and I nearly pissed myself. Needless to say thats the most action my gamer butt got in a while. Love this game, buy it."

26477,"I remember playing this game for the first time on my PS4 years ago, and the fun me and a friend had by just screaming and running thru the caves and this game. A lot of indie games that come out nowadays aren't usually that great, but this is just one of those games with an amazing plot, that they executed very well. The soundtrack is amazing, the enemies are very interesting and unique, the story is very riveting, there's a few side missions you can do, base building, just a lot to do in the game. There's nothing scarier than going into the caves with just the plane axe and a lighter, especially since the lighter decides to mess around and go out every single time you're about to do something important. Although there are exploits and glitches in the game to beat it or make it easier, playing the game legit for fun is awesome, and it really is a great co-op game to run with any of your friends, or even alone if you wish. There definitely is some replay value in this game, which is awesome as well. I remember getting the plat achievement on PS4 for this game, and I usually only do that for great games. If you're looking for a new game to play with some friends, this is definitely a good little horror survival you can all play."

no this game is not the most stunning in graphecs, but it is a very good looking game that can be ran on an average PC. to be honest the DEV team is amazing and i have not seen anything like this. i would recommend  to  most  every one. it is not so indepth that it is hard to pick up but it is not lacking by any means.


the only thing i would complain about is a lack in animal threats such as bears or wolves but this is a very miner complaint."

26524,"9/10 great game. Love the depth of the story and how easily i'm absorbed in play. I would have issues with some of the physics and a few other things if this game were large in data size, but for the size it is, it's basically perfect."

26630,"Awesome game.

Got it on a discount but to keep it short, this game brings exactly what I've always wanted. A survival game, with a damn story. And a good one at that.

It's what I always wanted from Don't Starve. Took me about 80 hours to finish, but to be fair I spend more than half just surviving and building my base.

Graphics are really good and the FPS is both high and stable."
26631,"Good game
"
26632,"Solid game!

I suggest to play with friends as it's more fun to throw all your morals out of the window and chop down naked women in the forest together. 

The Story is interesting and the game does a great job holding that balance between having the right amount of story clues (with its collectibles) and leaving you to explore everything at your own paste. 

Considering how the game used to be in its early stages (not the first acc I play it on) it has come a far way and while it's not perfect (you sometimes still can see through certain walls, achievements are buggy in multiplayer, ...) it certainly has improved a ton. 
Especially the multiplayer function I have to address; something that used to be so damn bad I quit the game with my friend is actually a ton of fun now. The few cut-scenes the game has, while they can't be entered together, look well made in the perspective of the second person too. Sound would be cool for them too but at least you get to experience them about as good as the other player. 

The Forest is a game you deffo can play once every half a year/year (just story, building never gets boring if you are into that stuff) and still have fun going through collecting everything over and over again. 
Hyped for the next game, will definitely buy"

This game is lots of fun, especially co-op. The open world allows you the freedom to progress the story or just play in an unofficial survival/build mode on your own schedule. 10/10 would recommend; can't wait for Sons of the Forest."

26752,the best game ever
26753,Best survival game out there.
26754,is good
26755,"very good game, better with friends"
26756,Fun gaem. Bear grylls simulator
26757,makes you experience something primal. this game will make you a caveman. this invokes violence. good
26758,"The game is overall fun and intense. The game is like a normal survival game but there are these zombie like human things that try to kill, but if you prefer a normal survival game then just set the game mode to peaceful then the zombie things will not exist in that new game you create. I do recommend playing with your friends or anyone because it just makes the overall experience 10 times better."
26759,"Though this game might be slight dated in 2022 because of all the crafting games that have since come out 8 years, it still remains an enjoyable game. I ended up playing this game alone because my friends tried it and didn't like, so refunded it. My main complaint is there's no real incentive to go north because of the cold, so I never saw a boar and skipped that  entire area. If you have VR I feel like this game could be horrifying"
26760,It make me shit pants i gave thumbs up
26761,cum in the canible badussy
26762,cannibalism
26763,I like hairspray now
26764,Why kill the cannibals and let their bodies rot when you can kill AND eat them. 10/10 game
26765,"This is a fantastic game if you're a fan of the survival genre. The sound design especially is top notch. Varying environments, multiple endings and enough achievements to keep even the casual gamer engaged."
26766,"actually tho, lamp."
26767,berry good
26768,It's fun
26769,<3
26770,"i hate this game
"
26771,Boom goes the canibal
26772,This was a really fun game to play. The achievements weren't too hard to complete and I was able to put in a decent amount of time. When you finish the game and achievements there's not much to do afterwards but was still a lot of good content. (was quite a bit of bugs but oh well)
26773,zamn this shit scary
26774,Good game enjoyed playing with my kid
26775,"my dad beats me
"
26776,play with friends and the game hits different
26777,very yes

26779,i killed a naked woman for bones to use as armor 10\10
26780,Dogwater game.
26781,fun game!
26782,Very good
26783,"This game is schizophrenic. It tries to be a horror game, a CO-OP survival game and an open world builder game and fails on all accounts due to poor implementation. The crafting system is unnecessarily complex and the inventory system makes no sense. Serveral basic functions(such as cooking, swapping equipped weapon/item or simply saving a multiplayer game) are extremely unintuitive and will sometimes screw you over. I'm a big fan of survival/builder games like Subnautica, Raft, Valheim etc but this one just doesn't cut it. It's shoddy workmanship all over that leaves you frustrated. I played this with a friend for about twelve hours and then we just stopped because there is too much wrong with the game to keep it enjoyable."
26784,very fun was a bit of a shocker when i hear a yowl and a naked person started attacking me but recommend anyway!

26805,"5gb waste of space
"
26806,boobs
26807,It is awesome
26808,i killed a babymaker
26809,"Very fun game, i like it."
26810,"While I can't say that the game is amazing, I think it is a fine game. I played the game with my friend on hard survival. We ended up dying a few times, before we picked the safest spot in the game, and got to work on setting up defenses. The parts we hated the most about this game was caving. It was very tedious and boring to do. The horror element of the game is kinda taken out when you are with a friend, so it was just me and my friend wandering aimlessly. About 15 hours into game play I discovered we had a cave map. That would've been useful for a long fucking time. We ended up packing supplies, getting to the bottom of the sinkhole, and I killed the final boss. I say ""I"" because my friend ended up getting glitched into the ground after trying to kill the final boss with a chainsaw. We ended up building a drip car, and sledding down into the sinkhole. This game really told us nothing, and I had to watch a few hours of farket to understand what the hell we were supposed to do. I love the cannibals in this game. Their behavior that doesn't make any sense really puts you on nerve. Finding a creeepy mutant or two out in the wild is always a scary sight. We, unfortunately, never had to deal with any raids, despite having the artifact to do so. Overall, I enjoy the game's cannibals and building in the world, but other than that it is an ok game."

26862,"This game is pretty fun, I've had it for 2 hours so far and I'm enjoying it.

I'd recommend going in blind though, I'm very happy that I don't know much about this game and that I get to uncover it as I go."

26867,lee
26868,Very fun by yourself or with friends. I enjoyed it a lot. Wished it was still being updated consistently. Can't wait for Sons of the Forest
26869,"Phenomenal Game. Although its not really scary, unless playing alone with cave/night brightness turned all the way down, its melee combat is brutal and its always fun to light cannibals on fire. The building is great and highly customization. The game inst fully polished, and i encountered a few glitches, but nothing full cyberpunk 2077 level.

Overall: Amazing game! Just waiting for the Sons of the Forest now..."

26878,"I liked that it's adventures and that it has horror in it. I love those types of game. Even when you can build in it and you have to get the materials you need to build it.

What I dislike is not really anything. It's very fun and im fine with everything."
26879,haha deforestation go brrrr
26880,THe best game ever. Its basicly a game to survive and explore. i always have super fun when i play this game and i strongly rekomend to buy it
26881,"Great survival game, you can have real fun with friends."
26882,Go vegan #Cannibalism
26883,tree
26884,Very nice game.
26885,"Items and world loot is shared between all the players on the server. You chop down a tree, you pick up the branches. Everyone else also able to pick up those same branches from the same tree that you chopped down. 

I don't see the logic in that. There should at least be an option to turn that off. 

Also, the game looks ok but the contrast ratio is really weird. Highlights are too bright and shadows are too dark.

Lastly, the mouse sensitivity slider doesn't work properly. At its lowest setting, which is 0, i would expect my mouse to do nothing. But it still moves my camera and it's still too high of a sensitivity (for me).

26899,"Was sceptical when a mate of mine told me to buy this game to lan. Boy was I ever surprised, this is a game very good game.

It's is fun, challenging and scary!!!

Only annoyance with this game is that is slightly unpolished, with a few glitches and wonky building mechanics."
26900,great game and great value :)
26901,"This game is awesome, I don't regret buying it at all.

10/10, even better with friends :D"
26902,"very good
"
26903,"Wow. Highly Recommended. The game feels like it's in a beta, but has enough content to rival most triple A games. Great progression, story, and lore. Great base building. While I would wish for more options, it still has more than enough.

The community is the only draw back. Playing online it's a solid 50/50 if your going to play with someone cool or a hacker/griefer/asshat of all sorts. Which is really sad, because this is one of those games that you have to work hard for everything. And one person can make you feel like you want to quit and never play again. So I wish you the best. It's a great time if you stick through it. Just keep looking for the good ones."
26904,its fun
26905,its one off the best co-op games for story and adventure. You can build bases and traps. you can craft a rollercoster. if that dosen't sound interaesting to you i dont know what does
26906,nigger
26907,very funny lookin dodgey men who try touch you in funny places ykyk ;) so kill them all round whiteboard out of 10 also use turtle shell as sled its very fun with freinds (if have any) enjoy :)

I know they are doing #2 but why it took them long time to do it. anyway i am waitingggggggggggggggggggg THANK YOU FOR MAKING SUPER FUN GAME!!!!!!!

26911,good game fun with friends

26913,"yes
"
26914,"has a few frustrating aspects like armor doesn't last and if you actually follow the story the game is a little short with no ""end game,"" but still pretty fun, good job done with the randomized AI etc"
26915,h

26944,"I never screamed so much in a video game and even though I have a hard time handling horror, I'm loving it! Playing with a friend makes it bearable, so I highly recommend if you scare easy, just add a friend to play with. It makes all the difference. I'm having a blast. I love the creativity of this game. It's one of the best survival games I've played yet (and I've played A LOT of survival!). I am going to put this one up there with the best (7 days to die, Subnautica, Green Hell, The Long Dark). Must-buy for people who love survival and base building."

"
26946,its good
26947,"This was a very fun game when I got it. It is the only actual good survival game I have for vr. And lot better with friends.

Though for the cons...
This game does not have an anti-cheat. You can host a local server and have random people join but also risk people with cheats to screw up your world. Its either that, or play singleplayer, or play with only friends.

Other than that, it is one of the best survival games. I cannot wait for Sons of The Forest to come out!"

27010,"My whole life I've been waiting for this game. Right out of the womb I told my mother this would come out in approximately 15 years. When it released I was so joyous I threw a party  at my parents little duplex and all my nerdy friends showed up to have a LAN and play it for the first time. We played for 8 hours and took a fun little bathroom break and continued our journey for happiness in the gaming world. At first the game wasn't bad, but slowly the shivers came in. After around the eight hours I was shivering timbers and my friends had to 911. But it was too late. I passed away from a major brain stroke. I think it was the lack of gameplay and it reminds me to much of minecraft. Especially the pesky zombies and the building mechanics. This is not me but this my mother speaking on behalf of me. Currently I am paralyzed from the neck down and will be a forever vegetable in this realm of shitty ass. I would nopt recommend this game for anyone lest you will meet the same fate as I did. I'm gay btw"
27011,"The Forest is an open-world survival game taking place on a strange island which may or may not have some human-like monsters roaming around.

Very good story-line to go behind it, I do wish it would let you carry more items on certain things that is needed for adventuring, but other than that, there is not one thing that I would change about this game. And also makes for a good bonding experience for friends of friends! If i had to rate this game out of 10 it would most definitely be (for me at least) 1,000,000/10!"

It has some lore but i didn t care about that..just watched it on youtube, the gameplay is fun, as i said you can shit ur pants in the caves, make buildings with friends, eat the cannnibals (The hunter became the hunted 4 us) and lots of exploring, you can hunt animals (and cannibals :)) make items and even make a small village with walls and all that...
The cons of the game i'd say are that: 1. Alone is pretty boring, 2. u need lots of freaking wood for medium buildings, 3. in the night ur fucked if ur alone and a group of cannibals comes into you base (especcialy the spider ones)."

27156,"The Forest is a great horror/survival coop game, played it with my friends, and played a solo world. It is definitely an experience. The forest itself looks really well made, it may all seem peaceful until some interesting monsters start to appear, then it all seems a bit twisted. That's why I like this game, surprised never end."
27157,Meat taste funny...        10/10
27158,This is Crimson Wind and I recommend this game .  The Forest is a fun survival game . I rate this  game 8/10.
27159,"This is classic  YouTube Hype. The game is buggy and should not be considered as a finished product. 
1> combat is virtually impossible when dealing with 8 or more enemies at the same time.
2> Defensive builds are weak to the point that it is pointless to build and use them.
3> Food gets destroyed way to easily. 
4> Mobs are OP to the point that the i just build save points because i die ALL the time. 
5> When the game glitch player loses everything. 

In conclusion: This game hates the player to the point that the game isn't fun. The player can't enjoy the build aspect, can't enjoy the survival aspect and it becomes endless frustration with the combat glitches that enable mobs to insta-kill because the player becomes frozen. Mobs also destroy food so recovery becomes impossible and again more frustration.  Maybe my PC can't handle the game as well as it should but i cannot recommend this game to anyone because the game is simply not finished."

27177,"[h1]TLDR[/h1]
 So far, it's very promising. 

[h1]Cons [/h1]

[list]
    [*] There's a glitch where you will occasionally do a charged / heavy attack even though you are no longer giving input on keyboard or mouse. 
    [*] Steep Learning Curve (although, not as steep as some other games)
    [*] Multiplayer bugs are few, but when they happen, being attacked by invisible enemies sucks. 
    [*] There are occasional sound glitches where there are no cannibals, but you can hear a cannibal, which make you panic a bit, thinking you're about to get attacked. 
[/list]

[h1] Pros [/h1]
[list]
    [*] Excellent Survival Sim
    [*] Challenging Enemies / Fights
    [*] Beautiful Visuals
    [*] Extensive Crafting System w/ Unique Interface

[spoiler] So first up, there's a fair amount of cringe culture in this game. The cringe starts as soon as you run into any females. This game has boobies, and probably other jiggly bits, but I haven't gotten far enough or glimpsed them. 

What I have seen are mutant cannibal babies that blob along the ground and make the most disgusting and nightmarish sounds.

The worst parts of the game (so far) are the best parts of the game. Be prepared for disappointment with your first bow. Killshots are not a thing with early arrows. Maybe upgrades will yield better results. 

Loot, survive, stay alive. 

Will update upon game completion.

27178,"I took a chance on this game, as you don't always know with early access games (at that time) whether or not they will end up finished or even what they promised to be. Thankfully, 260+ odd hours later, it turns out I found a hidden gem in this game.

The story is decent, although if you are like me, you might forget about your son for a loooong time (like in fallout) as you focus on surviving and building up a decent base or bases.

The game has decent survival elements, and the enemies are just as interesting. The more days you survive, the harder it becomes (which is a nice change, as usually, once established in a survival game, it can become too easy) as different enemies begin to appear and the AI seems to, at times, try and work out ways into your camp/base/settlement.

I don't want to give too much a way, so IMO. this game is worth a shot - plus, the incoming second game looks even better, so this franchise is really looking like something to get behind. Enjoy!"
27179,Played this with a cob of mine and this is super fun. Very excited when they release the sequel so highly recommend for anyone who's got pals to play with and explore.
27180,I give it 5/7

27186,"Amazing game when you play with your friends, But my only concern is is that I still have to manually save the game which is hard for me and my friends because my game kept on crashing and there were times where I wasn't able to save, where all our progress is gone ;-; 

But overall It's a great and fun game AHHAHAHAHA
"
27187,I like the cannibal boobies
27188,Yes
27189,"Must play survival game. I solo completed the game to experience the dark, scary, and complex cave system. Then completed the game two times with friends to enjoy the co-op aspect of the game (Hearing friends scream) :D. The story behind this game is great too, can't wait for the son of the forest to be out!"

27193,"You crash land on an island filled with cannibals with your son missing, instead of searching for said son you will end up building mega-structures and borderline becoming as insane as the very cannibals you fend off each day.

Beware of the flying sausage monster."
27194,Its cool
27195,A classic game. Even better with friends.
27196,Very good game
27197,super fun game i have many hours on it on playstation and then got a pc and this game is amazing with friends and solo
27198,died to person eating my ass then the cannibals came in the game and ended it
27199,i got it on sale for 8 dolars and its great but its super scary you might has some problems if you dont understand the game and the creaters can and sould make a better death animtion but for the most part its great it made with only 4 people and for the quality its great
27200,"Near the end of the game, there was this spot where you got kinda stuck and it was cringe. You had to get lucky with a jump to get out of it."
27201,very nice
27202,good scary
27203,"Great fun with the homies. Build a base in the trees, hunt some mutants to extinction. have a good time"

(
TL;DR  kinda shit game doesn't respect your time or efforts. kinda fun with a buddy, use cheats to get some extra play time. 2/5 game, below average.
SLEEPING MAKES THE GAME HARDER for little to no benefit, just drink in-game soda
)
-Spend hours cutting and delivering trees to have a hut and defenses, cannibals destroy your work and the resources used.
Ok. ""don't build just anywhere""
-build safely on an island, cheating out the 600 logs my buddy and I already delivered for our Barbie Dreamhouse ‚Ñ¢
...what did I need a base for? Building upgrades to survive the trek to save Timmay.  Upgrades mostly make building easier. 
build  to upgrade -> upgrade to build..... weapons and survival tools come from caves... ""building is a waste of time.""
Spoiler enhancement: [spoiler]your one objective is already a waste of time, for reasons. So you're supposed to do all this survival crafty BS just to do it.  [/spoiler]
There are more complete survival crafters that respect your time.    This is scraping the bottom of the barrel for me.

OH. and the lighting never gets better. darkness everywhere, so the only scares are jumpy, or body horror I guess."

I got no wife, but you got a boyfriend

Rip you in front of your crew like, ""It didn't happen to me""
The difference is: I'm real and you're phony
My style's fat, like Siragusa, Tony
Yo what you gonna do? You can't hurt me
A threat from both sides of the plate, like Eddie Murray
But don't worry, I get straight up in your face
It's John Cena, 'bout to blow the roof off the place
It's No Mercy, so don't worry, I'm dirty
I'll bleed you 'til you burgundy, what? Yo, you can't hurt me
I physically murdered G's
Yo, it's absurd to me you can't see this
With telescopic lenses
I'm crazy like twenty-inch rims on them Benzes
You don't think I can rap? You calling me black? What's up with that?
Yo, I teach you straight how to act
Yo this is ill, this John Cena's committee
You from Baltimore but I straight run the city
Down and gritty, yo, it's time to get dirty
Wave your hands up I don't care if you're four or thirty!
What's up?!
Yo, that's right, that's right, baby
'Cause I'm ill like a sick metaphor
Got the crowd chanting ""Cena"" like they want some more
Yo, hand in front of my face, ""you can't see me""
You probably heard me rip MC's on 92.3
That's right, hold up your hands, wave 'em high
That was a nice diss but it was a wack ass try
You can't fly with me, C-E-N-A
It's a freestyle rap, baby, we don't play
I come off the dome like every day
Come at you from both sides like lesbian threeways

27341,"After about 14 hours of playing with my friends, we have finished the game and we can say, or I can say, that it is absolutely worth buying the game on offer. The game offers a lot of tension, interest and fun. If you have a lot of interest in mysterious secrets, then it's worth it. What is also nice about the game is that besides the campaign, the game also has a lot of free things to offer, by which I mean that you can build your own houses, defenses and a lot more. So if you want to try a new game for a change, which doesn't cost too much, you will find yourself at home here."

Its a fantastic game, genuinely one of my favourite survivals I've played. It doesn't force you to do the story, you can literally build, farm & hunt if that's all you want to do, or you can do all of that plus actively doing the story. There's so much to do and explore  and its great to play with your friends too. 10/10 would reccomend."

27379,"If you like multiplayer open world survival crafters with spooky atmosphere (think 7 Days, H1Z1/Just Survive, etc.), you'll really enjoy this.

The gathering and building systems are okay, and in line with basic expectations for the genre. Cut trees, gather sticks and other assorted bits, build things. The building is flexible enough that you can make some cool creations (check the community screenshots), but it's never going to rival something like Conan Exiles. There also isn't much in the way of decoration available, though this fits well with the theme of the game.

The inventory and crafting systems are unique, immersive, and intuitive. Everything you carry around is represented by the item itself on a big tarp -- an actual big pile of stuff rather than the typical icon/number in a bag slot that most inventory systems default to. You combine those items in the middle of the tarp to make new items, and while it isn't the deepest, most tiered crafting system I've ever seen, it also doesn't feel skimpy. Everything has purpose.

The combat is excellent, and the enemy animations are spot-on. The hitboxes and enemy strike range feel perfectly tuned. The encounters with these things are sometimes genuinely horrifying (especially that first playthrough -- all those sounds in all those caves WILL make you feel things). I don't really want to say anything about the individual enemy types, because some things are better left for players to discover on their own. It'll be quite a discovery, though, I assure you.

Speaking of caves, there are a lot of them to explore, with a ton of items/equipment to find (lots of stuff in the overworld, too). The world is static, so once you get the island memorized you'll know just where to go for everything in subsequent playthroughs, but getting to that point takes quite a bit of time (provided that you don't use an online map to assist, but even then sometimes it's difficult to orient when underground).

The cherry on top of an already fun game is the surprisingly engaging story. It's told in a way that starts off by piecing together subtle, disturbing clues but eventually snowballs into something much more goal-oriented and linear and clear. You don't have to mess with the story at all if you don't want to -- the game functions just fine as a pure survival builder. But I'd highly recommend it.

Gather some buddies and crash a plane on murder island. It's totally worth experiencing."

27393,"While not a perfect game, it was still an excellent experience to play through. 

At times it feels like it's two games at odds with each other (the more standard Survival stuff in the Forest, and the creepier cave-diving), and it'd probably be an even better game had the devs focused on one of the halves, but it's still great overall. 

Highly recommend it! If you're into creepy, scary stuff, solo play is for you, if you just want the story and experience, co-op is a fun, albeit occasionally buggy experience."

27486,"I had an absolute blast playing this game with a friend. At first glance, I thought it was going to be a mindless survival game but I was totally wrong. The cave systems were massive and extremely well designed, the story was well-written, and the crafting was so fun that we spent 5 hours building a lift to access a hilltop for our base... also, don't even get me started on the cannibal AI. They're so damn smart that they will literally watch you from afar, not engage you, and observe your every move so they can plan their attack accordingly. I was blown away by the level of detail the developers put into this game. I bought the game on sale but would have 10000% paid full price. I cannot wait to play Sons of the Forest in May :)"

27508,"Realmente no se que decir. Estoy enojado por varios aspectos del juego. Lo termine tanto en ps4 como en Pc 2 veces y mate a todos los bosses, Whorm y Megan 3 en total. La idea del juego es excelente, de hecho el gameplay en si es excelente y la historia esta ahi para acompa√±arlo a este, haciendo a ""The Forest"" una experiencia survival horror muy vivida y de las mas turbias que uno podria jugar. Imagino que se preguntaran que es lo que me enoja respecto al juego, si todo lo que mencione fueron alagos. La cuestion es que todo lo que me enoja del juego son en aspectos tecnicos. El juego esta LLENOOO, y digo REPLETO de bugs. Algunos son graciosos, otros son perdonables y otros incluso arruinan el rol y la experiencia, rompiendo el juego completamente. Y no solo los bugs, sino que tambien la mala optimizacion del juego. The Forest parece que fue optimizado por 4 monos y medio. Tengo una rtx 2060, jugue el juego en medium/low y me iba de 60 a 35 fps, lo que me parece completamente injugable. Por momentos parecia que estaba jugando en ps4 pero con teclado. Horrible. El juego es bueno, muy bueno y lo recomiendo, solo advierto respecto a los bugs que van a encontrar jugando y recomiendo que jueguen en low a 720p o menos por que ya te digo que ni una Rtx 3090 va a poder correr bien el juego. 


Edit: Estuve investigando un poco mas y lo que mas baja fps es hostear un server de multiplayer (q evidentemente es la forma mas divertida de experimentar el juego, jugando con amigos). Si jugas singleplayer o multiplayer sin hostear, el juego deberia ir bien depende que gpu tengas. Ahora respecto a los bugs, xD ta bastante bugeado el juego, no hay mucho que decir."

27536,very similar to forza 3
27537,"very cool, also Epstein didn't k1ll himself."
27538,very time consuming
27539,after only 2 hours of playing i can confidently say this is the best survival game out there. the graphics are amazing. the ambient sounds of the nature and slight screams in the background gave me chills. the best part is that its genuinely scary too. the crafting is super intuitive and the realism is surprisingly spot on all things considered. and all for only $8 on sale?? you wont find a better game at this pricepoint.
27540,great game but look out for the bats
27541,cum
27542,"I thought this game looked like a good survival game similar to other survival games I'd played, but even though it starts out promising, eventually I found the survival element to be extremely basic and superficial.  The game has plenty of different animals for you to hunt and plants to collect but they are all so abundant (and loot too) that there's never any threat of starving or dying of thirst. There are plenty of things to craft and that creates an incentive to look for particular animals and plants, but once you've crafted them all there's no real pressure to gather food or hunt. I thought things would get more difficult as I went along but in reality the only thing that threatens your survival is attacks from the mutants. 

The other major problem I have with the game is that base building is essentially unnecessary. It's purely cosmetic, as the mutants basically never attack it unless you build somewhere close to their villages or patrol routes. Basically all you need to do is build the most basic hut in the game and it will serve the same purpose as a huge base with palisades and guard towers all around. Also, building even a medium sized base requires A LOT of grind, from collecting timber or stones you need and bringing them back.

Another thing I didn't like with the game is that exploring the caves, which is necessary to ""progress"" whatever semblance of a story there is in the game, is mostly just tedious and pretty much impossible to do properly - unless you know how (you need to plant lots of skull lamps around each cave to let you see what you're doing).

My last major gripe with the game is the ""snow area"" (I don't know what else to call it), which is a large area in the map that's covered with snow leading to up to a mountain. Firstly, this area starts about 50 meters above sea level, despite the fact the rest of the island seems to have a tropical or sub-tropical climate. Then in order to explore this area you need to craft a ""warmsuit"", which requires more components than any other craft item, but after exploring it pretty thoroughly it seems there's basically nothing in it, just a few abandoned tents and nothing particularly interesting. So it's essentially just a waste of time bothering with it.

To be fair to the game I thought it did do some things quite well. The graphics are pretty nice and I think the horror elements of the game are pretty unnerving, like the weird appearance and behaviour of the mutants and the strange style of buildings they use. There is also plenty of building options for base building too, if you have the patience.

To me the Forest would be better described as an ""open world horror"" game rather than a ""survival"" game, as the survival element is largely superficial, while exploring dark caves and battling strange creatures is actually what the game is mainly about.

27543,"11/10 Best Game EVER

the 2nd guy below me doesn't know games... he probably just plays auto-battlers like TFT."
27544,yes
27545,"This game is the definition of pain. 

You eat a berry once, its all g. 
You eat a berry twice, you die. 

The water can kill you, or it doesnt kill you. 
Sometime zombies want to kill you, sometimes they dont. 

You're friends leave you to die, over and over again like its groundhog day. 

The zombies are also naked. No cap.

But you can put seagull heads on your base. So i guess its worth buying. 

"
27546,"18 hours, no searching things up until we absolutely had to in order to paw our way through the tiring and difficult journey of this game, and I say this in a positive manner. I mean that this game does everything it can to throw you into the shits when you think you're safe and everything is fine. Unexpected things will happen. 

This game is actually very well made, solid frame rate at all times during game play albeit loading screens. The story is actually fairly easy to follow if you pay attention to the files you've found and pictures and what not. We had not known there was multiple endings to the game and we happened to get a darker one. I won't spoil anything for those yet to play it, but I will say that the implications this game leaves you with on that ending are wild. I have not played a game that isn't afraid to go all in on their story like this in a good while, they don't pull their punches with this one. 

All in all, I would give this game around a 85/100 because I had found much joy in this game, from learning to do the crafting without realizing you can hover over the gear to see what you need to make specific items, finding out which weapons worked best for me and having my loved one with me through all of this. I recommend playing this game with one other person at least, it is much more fun when you're not alone, however if you're into it for a true horror survivalcraft experience. This is a VERY good game for it!"

27634,"[UPDATED REVIEW] I have put in around 23 hours now into the game and have progressed through the story quite a bit, but sadly throughout that process, I have decided that I can no longer recommend this game. The game just feels way too incomplete and it only gets worse the longer I play it. I've ran into countless bugs and have reached a point where I am no longer enjoying the game like I once was, trying to complete this game has become a burden. Overall this game is very fun but there are so many things holding it back from being a good game. 


[FINAL UPDATE] I just finished the game and honestly, I'm speechless with how great the ending was and how refreshing it felt to see the entire story link up and build up to the ending. I have decided to change my review to recommend the game again just based off the story itself. Although the gameplay and buggy mechanics frustrated us often, the story made up for it, glad to say that I can recommend this game once again."

27743,its a very good survival game
27744,"I enjoy the story line and building techniques you have to use to go further into the game, playing only on normal so far the cannibals are hard to defeat at some points but still a very fun game."
27745,its bussin
27746,"Great Game, never played it before though"
27747,there are trees
27748,"The game should not be called THE FOREST, it should be called THE CAVES. 

CONTENT:
- There is no content on the surface at all, that you are encouraged to do.
- To complete the game you need to go into THE CAVES and hope to find the cave that has the items you need.

SURVIVAL:
- There is no survival aspect, I could survive the game only on chocolate bars and sodas found in caves.

BUILDING:
- Building in this game is pointless, there is no point in having a base as caved are split across the map and monster attacks are large and its just a waste of time to fight them.

COMBAT:
- There is no variety of monsters in this game, like 4 types of monsters with variants of each other.
- Combat system/attacks are overall clunky and slow"
27749,"This game is about finding holes.
The spear is the only thing you need to poke the naked. 
But without booze this game is unplayable.
And that kid (Timmy) was meant to become beyblade."
27750,NO DON'T BUY IT!
27751,a very fun game  to play alone and with friends
27752,Played for less than 2 hours and liked it so much that I gifted 3 family members the game also.
27753,This isn't the Ihop
27754,"This game saved my life.

I am 41.

My ex-wife and I have a daughter together, and adopted our son together. They are now both 4 years old.

When we were going through our separation, I found myself lost and miserable. I was self destructive. I got so mad one day from everything spiraling out of my control that I punched some concrete in a moment of overwhelming emotion. That caused me to break my 5th metacarpal in my right hand... my working hand... my games hand.. the hand that I held and carried my children to bed with.. The hand I desperately needed to make sure I could continue to provide.

After learning of the severity of my self-inflicted damage, I was borderline suicidal. Keep in mind that just a few months before this, I was the happiest man with no history of depression or anxiety. I have never had fits of rage, or been one to break down and cry, but I was in a low spot that just really buried me from being able to see the light on the other side.

Having nothing better to do, I searched for a game I could play, ONE HANDED while I recovered. I somehow stumbled upon this game and read some of the reviews. I decided that it had to be worth a shot... I must admit, I didn't beat the game, or play nearly as long as some of you. In fact, I may have only played this game a day or two.. With that being said, after doing so, I had a new found joy and hope for life. I was able to put behind me the pain and suffering that had been cast over me. I was able to experience other peoples joy and happiness. I was able to see the fruits of my ""labor"". I relaxed for 5 minutes to this music long enough to realize that I was going to be okay.
After coming to that realization, I turned the game off, and I went back to work. It hurt my hand like hell but I was motivated. I stopped feeling so damn sorry for myself, and I became the father I needed to be in that moment, not the weak boy I was behaving as.

Today, I am close friend with my kids mother. We don't fight, or argue, or say hurtful things to each other. We are parents, and friends.

I now have 3 kids. My third child is, wait for it, ALSO 4 YEARS OLD. The woman I am with was going through a very similar situation at the time of my own separation, and we just stumbled in to each others life unexpectedly. We have been in a relationship for a year now, and are very happy together.

Moral of the story, you never know what life holds in store for you, and if I would have given up when all the odds were stacked against me, I wouldn't be where I am today. This silly little game helped me realize that.

Thank you"

27798,"this game is a really fun and enticing solo or multiplayer game, with a optional story and lore that you do not have to follow to play and get far.
CoOp: 10/10- very cool and gives a in game way of communication which is nice.
Story/Lore: 8/10- some parts are hard to follow my first play through i did have to look some stuff up, but interesting story. 
Survival: 10/10- love the way that survival gets harder the harder the difficulty is set, where you set up camp also plays a factor.
overall: 9.5/10- There are still some glitches and plot holes but overall enjoyment was high and I found myself playing for a long time.

27925,Great game to play with friends! Especially with this holiday discount (at the time of writing this review)!
27926,"*RECEIVED THIS GAME FOR FREE*

TLDR: The game is a worthwhile play, it is enjoyable.
However the game can be quite slow and boring at times.
Progression through the story is optional but pretty much required.
The game is worthwhile with a discount.

I personally think this game is quite a bit of fun. It's very engaging and the concept of this gamestyle is really interesting.

The game is centred around the survival aspect of 'The Forest'. Similar to other games such as Rust, Raft, Dayz, Minecraft. Your aim is to survive for as long as possible, on both natural resources and resources gathered from surrounding establishments. 

Where this game differs from the afore mentioned games, is that there is a strong emphasis on the plot and story of the game, in which you must locate your son Timmy, who was taken by a cannibal not long after the plane crashed.

Although the story is technically optional, it is pretty much necessary to have any fun and to progress in equipment. As the majority of supplies such as food and water, as well as upgraded tools are acquired by engaging in the story.

The story in particular is quite interesting, there is definitely a lot that could be delved into regarding lore, and the story unfolds itself very nicely.

My only criticism with the game would be that it can be quite difficult initially, due to the lack of instructions. However this is also a good thing as the game teaches you the mechanics through failure.

One thing to note however; the game is able to be completed within 1 hour. It is usually done much longer within the 15 - 30hr mark from other reviews and mentions. 
I personally found the game far to slow paced for my likings. It is far too difficult to locate the items and is very redundant. So through the use of a walkthrough or two  - to guide me in the right direction (after doing the same thing for an hour). I was able to comfortably complete the game in 11hrs feeling very satisfied with the story."

27954,"My boyfriend kept seeing that this game was rated high. We played together and he got bored very quickly. It's like an offline Rust or instructionless 7 Days to Die. It's just... Weird. And if you don't kill the people outside the cabin you make.. It sounds like there's a huge orgy going on. I guess it's alright if you've never played games like 7DtD or Rust, but overall we had both found that most of our time playing was spent on how to use the controls. We ended up resorting to Google to figure out how to do a lot of things. I recommend getting Sea of Thieves over this game. It's better quality for the price. I'm just thankful I got this while it was on sale."

27980,"Play through The Forest in 2020-2021, and I had an absolutely immersive blast. This is an easily digestible entry into survival for someone like me who's inexperienced with the genre. It is captivating, horrifying, and builds a perfect road of rising tension and mystery as you discover terrible clues of the peninsula. Highly recommend for a heart-pumping single player terror-ride."
27981,help they got timmy
27982,"The ecosystem on this fictional planet makes no sense. The 'cannibals' (who weren't actually that canaballising anything, and should've died long ago had the digestive system even remotely occurred in the developers minds, as no humans graced the face of the small barren 'island') are poor excuses for enemies, and even the baddest bitches in the whole of the planet were big ass babies who got their ass smashed in by my small ass coin bomb. At the end, the endings were, well, disappointing to say the least, but i'll leave that to you losers who would love to discover this full game. The ecosystem would've been thrown into full disarray had any simple research been completed before hand, however it was clear there was no pre-development phase. The 'cannibals' (whom i have mentioned were completely upsetting and pitiful) should've ate everything and anything shown by their nature and juicy phat bazooga bums, and send the environment into havoc. But nope, the trees still grew like hormonal petty bitches and the rabbits kept on running their dumb asses into my little dumb fuckin traps which made me visibly upset. I hauled my stupid ass around for almost an hour to build a scrubby little hut which could not fit me and my 7 other friends who all seemed to love this game also. The alternate ending the game had in store for us was also disappointing. Our child had a huge spasm which was completely normalised and everyone was gasping as if theresa may death-dropped on stage. Can't find a pro for this game. Enjoy <3"

27984,spook
27985,picked the wrong ending. Therefore this game is awful. also why is there no forest i was tricked. The title is lying its actually a big beach . Peace out

27992,Dis game de bomb
27993,yeah
27994,"It is a really fun survival game, at the moment, it is one of my favorite survival games, and I recommend to play this game. The only thing that is very rude in this game, is when you have 2 screens, if you are turning your caracter into the left or into the right (it depends where you place your second screen), your seeing a cursor and when you click for farming wood or kill a cannibal, it is going to quite the game instead :( , please fix that bug, but the game on it self is very good :). I recommend it."
27995,very fun game. i like it.
27996,"I love this game a lot. I used to play it all the time with friends and some of my fondest memories are on this game. I wish I could go back and do it all again and experience this game for the first time again.

This game is a must play with friends. It is really fun to build, explore and defend with friends on this game. I look forward to what the next game will bring!

Thank you for all the amazing memories and nights of fun."

28023,I don't wanna change anyone's opinion but this game is great it really is but the story is lack luster and the game gets boring after awhile I changed my perspective on this game and really realized what it is the game is basically run into a cave get the stuff you need and then after that base building and additional obtainable items but that's really about it but this is my opinion personally I would not recommend if I do recommend wait for a sale DO NOT BUY FULL PRICE

The ai of the cannibals in this game is amazing, you learn alot about how they act and what their intentions are, they also have patrol routes that you learn about. Its a great game and the story is also great btw. Cant wait for Sons of the Forest."
28046,This Game is great really relaxing during the day you can build and hunt but come night you will fight off some crazy motherfuckers and exploring caves and shit is also good best if you have people to play with though.

28096,"This game is very creative and enjoyable with creating and surviving on an island full of dangerous entities like mutants and cannibals. It sometimes takes skill to travel through the story and get to place with it but in the end you get there. With VR being supported with the game is even better, game mechanics are more challenging but attacks and swings with items are much easier to use.

I recommend playing this game if you're a chiller."

28100,"This game bring out the worst in me, for some reason I have tendencies to not only kill but to hang cannibals from sticks, while setting them on fire with hairspray and a lighter. Then shortly after cut up their body parts and make monuments out of them... 9.9/10"
28101,i can burn the people
28102,h
28103,"Quite well made.  I used to dream of making a game very similar to this myself.  Visuals are very good.  Crafting is rewarding.   Being a very experienced camper, survivalist and having lived for a short time by bushcraft myself, I appreciate it.  If the developers are still adding to this game, I'll add a wishlist...

Proper fire building technique: stone ring, then leaves, then sticks then, later a large log to burn in half.  This is how fires are done and it would be cool to see it represented in a bit more detail.  The fire is the heart of a camp.
Garbage on the seashores.  It really is everywhere.  Just a few odd pieces and a useful item now and again.
Add plastic bottles.  They can hold one water.  Cannot be used to boil.  
Make it cost slightly more endurance to cut trees down.  You should have to rest for a moment after each tree.
I like how the tree cut animation chips wedges out of the tree!  Nice touch.  It made me wonder if you could work out a way that causes the tree to fall realistically to the way it is being cut.  I have felled a few trees and its not that hard in a basic way.  Front wedge, back cut, etc.
One last thing... I get that there is a list of plants found, but if there are notes on what they do I dont see it.

Thanks for the game experience.  You rock and I hope you make a good buck!"

28114,Cannibal's meats are pretty great ngl :)
28115,"4/5 

This is a great example of what a survival game CAN be with its mysterious island lore, intuitive crafting system, and competently frightening AI. With or without friends, this game is an absolute blast to play, and there's always something to do, something to discover, something to kill. The only things I didn't enjoy about the game are minor things which are greatly outweighed by the positives, and I can't wait to see how polished the gameplay will be when the sequel comes out."

28136,"What a game. In my top 10 of all time.

More mystery and story twists than an M.Night Shyamalan movie. Gameplay is great, enemies are satisfyingly spooky and the building is pretty good.

A proper gem of a game that deserves even more praise than it's already gotten."

28138,yak and yea
28139,"Highly recommend this game because it has a very interesting story and it can also be scary! There are a lot of things to explore on the map and that makes the game spontaneous since you don't really know what you can expect from it. It has a few weird bugs but overall it is very exciting and enjoyable, especially with friends!!!!!"

28166,"Glad I bought this game. Haven't tried multiplayer, but solo is a lot of fun. It can seem tedious building and collecting. The real trouble is when the Guardian and Reset View don't fix the terrain levels. The story is scary like the cannibals. I don't foresee myself getting tired or bored with this game."

Despite the minor flaws, this game is unlike anything I've ever played before; and I look forward to (hopefully!) surviving long enough to finish the story!"

28242,"Game is unreal, give us the sons of the forrest! Hurry up damn it!"
28243,"The Forest is an excellent game with a compelling story line and the gameplay to back the story up. The visuals are stunning, with the lighting being very well done. The attention to detail in this game is meticulous, such as the precise sound design, the animations, and some other completely random things that just enhance the experience such as the chance for a bird to fly onto your hand if you're standing outside. Most of the things and items found on the peninsula have some connection to the lore. The AI of the mutants in this game is where this game really shines, this isn't some AI pathfinding thing where it just constantly looks for you to kill you. You can remain friendly with the mutants, you can be hostile, the mutants respond to your actions accordingly. There are patrol lines of the mutants, there are multiple tribes and they clash. Now, the cave system is really the bread and butter of The Forest, and this is where it really gets interesting. By delving deep into the complex cave systems of The Forest, you will encounter new enemies, find new and better weapons and find items crucial to the lore. Without spoiling anything, I can say that this game exactly follows a linear circular narrative with the ending, the ending isn't cliche, and will probably surprise you (unless you've paid very good attention to the lore throughout the game). I personally find The Forest much more enjoyable with friends, however, the single-player experience is also excellent.

All-in-all, if you're a fan of survival/horror games, there is no game I would recommend more than The Forest."

"
28339,"Great atmosphere with a real sense of foreboding about exploring dark, dingy caves. 

Although the game's idea of ""death"" is being dragged unconscious to the same cave location again and again making more for an inconvenience than an actual threat but be sure to save often regardless.

Very much looking forward to the sequel!"
28340,"My friends told me to get this game, and i got it without knowing literally anything about it at all. What a horrifying yet exciting surprise this game is :)"
28341,"Pure Dankness, theres some slight bugs but nothing worth putting you off the game its really good and often on sale, massive replayability with a optional but fun story."
28342,"It is a very interesting and fun survival game. This game sort of contains a horror element because of the mutants. You can fish, build bases, search for upgraded weapons, and explore. What I loved about this game is the constantly having to evade the mutants, or fight them off. You can use stealth, or you can go in fighting when you see a village of them or a patrol. I would recommend this game to anyone who likes survival games such as, Minecraft, Ark, Rust, and more."

28368,"I am a 69 yo father, probably one of the oldest people playing this game. I am a single farther to my Son, who is 16 now. My son got this game for Christmas from his uncle, so we installed it on his computer and he started playing. By the end of the week he had 30 hours on this game. This was horrible for me, as it was already hard for me to find ways to spend time with my son, as he is always out with his friends or just, watching YouTube. So i decided to make a Steam account and get this game to see if I could maybe play alongside him. loaded into the game, made my character and world and started playing but I was stuck on what you where supposed to do. I asked my Son for help and he hosted a game for me to join. loved it as it was the best time had spent with my Son since my wife had died. This game has ever since brought me and my son closer again and now we actually spend time together outside the house together as well. This game reminded me that there's fun to be had in everything, and it has brought both me and my Son many happy memories."

28406,Want a island survival game to play single player or multiplayer with your friends. Try this its a island survival game based off a plane wreck. The main problem after the plane wreck is that well yeah human eaters become a thing. You can also build cool forts maybe have struggles along the way because of the human eaters. You can play in a game mode like peaceful that gets rid of the human eaters and have an easier time building your cool fort and having fun with friends. Another ability in peaceful is you run out of thirst and hunger easier and same thing on stamina but health is all the same.

28424,"Like creepy cannibal beings in caves with multiple arms and legs that throw babies at you? Well, this game is for you then! The first time I ever saw this game I knew I'd like it, this is my favorite genre after all, Open world survival crafting. I know it seems like this game just keeps going, but there is an end, a very strange one at that, and it's pretty much in line with the rest of this creepy storied game. VR makes the creepy factor of having babies thrown at you in a cave even more creepy and generally adds new life to the game even if you've beaten it in non VR."
28425,"This game saved my life.

I am 41.

My ex-wife and I have a daughter together, and adopted our son together. They are now both 4 years old.

When we were going through our separation, I found myself lost and miserable. I was self destructive. I got so mad one day from everything spiraling out of my control that I punched some concrete in a moment of overwhelming emotion. That caused me to break my 5th metacarpal in my right hand... my working hand... my games hand.. the hand that I held and carried my children to bed with.. The hand I desperately needed to make sure I could continue to provide.

After learning of the severity of my self-inflicted damage, I was borderline suicidal. Keep in mind that just a few months before this, I was the happiest man with no history of depression or anxiety. I have never had fits of rage, or been one to break down and cry, but I was in a low spot that just really buried me from being able to see the light on the other side.

Having nothing better to do, I searched for a game I could play, ONE HANDED while I recovered. I somehow stumbled upon this game and read some of the reviews. I decided that it had to be worth a shot... I must admit, I didn't beat the game, or play nearly as long as some of you. In fact, I may have only played this game a day or two.. With that being said, after doing so, I had a new found joy and hope for life. I was able to put behind me the pain and suffering that had been cast over me. I was able to experience other peoples joy and happiness. I was able to see the fruits of my ""labor"". I relaxed for 5 minutes to this music long enough to realize that I was going to be okay.
After coming to that realization, I turned the game off, and I went back to work. It hurt my hand like hell but I was motivated. I stopped feeling so damn sorry for myself, and I became the father I needed to be in that moment, not the weak boy I was behaving as.

Today, I am close friend with my kids mother. We don't fight, or argue, or say hurtful things to each other. We are parents, and friends.

I now have 3 kids. My third child is, wait for it, ALSO 4 YEARS OLD. The woman I am with was going through a very similar situation at the time of my own separation, and we just stumbled in to each others life unexpectedly. We have been in a relationship for a year now, and are very happy together.

Moral of the story, you never know what life holds in store for you, and if I would have given up when all the odds were stacked against me, I wouldn't be where I am today. This silly little game helped me realize that.

Thank you

Would recommend playing multiplayer for a more fulfilling experience."

28524,"Pro-tip from a local, you can light a tennis ball and be a human torch. 
- This game is so in the grey...not because of the tennis ball trick. The initial five hours were so bland, everything seemed as generic as it can get and the game wasn‚Äôt expecting anything from me, it was as if the game was pretty much expecting me to know it all. Survival, the first two days it was berries and mushrooms with an occasional warning from the locals to stop plundering their stuff seemed normal. But it soon got tedious when I tried to progress, the first rabbit trap was 31 sticks - the game for some reason mostly spawns a few dozen sticks in a particular area rather than spanning to a larger space so there were times either you stumble upon dozens of them or there is nothing. Same for a Cabin, had to chop down 20 trees. By the time I was done with the two, it felt like a part of the forest is gone. Survival Guide checklist was useless, it asked me to build a shelter and now it wants me to defend it‚Ä¶but from what?
- Bugs, just like with the sticks birds do the same and they are so abundant you can see 4-5 of them occupying a single spot with some choppy AI, same with animals. 5 hours in-game walking around and I was still unsure of the objective, my guy won‚Äôt say or write down anything about the geology. The local population kill count according to steam achievement has gone up to 25 though I haven‚Äôt killed a soul yet. One of the worst about the game was the hostile animal spawn, they just spawn right under your butt or somewhere behind with the occasional despawn. This caused my first knockout, an alligator spawned right behind and attacked, there was a fight and it retreads then re-spawned behind me again. I know it‚Äôs the same alligator because of the blood splashes and it happened twice with the same alligator. 
- The locals were kind enough to rescue my butt from the beast and secure it in a cave‚Ä¶now the game decides to give me a map and a compass‚Ä¶why now? And the map is empty so the previous 5 hours were for nothing. In fact, this game should call itself - ""The Abysmally Dark Caves"", because everything the game has to offer for the plot is in the caves. I say abysmally dark because you can‚Äôt see sh!t, most of the time I was spooked by my own hands. Of course, the game has options to craft any and everything from the start including torches and I was stupid to think there will be craft progression/blueprints to collect so ended up face to face with a baby-maker humping my guy to death. Start again, this run doesn‚Äôt count.

The second run was way better since I understand the game elements a bit more, inventory management/crafting system was excellent. Cave exploration is now better with spears and arrows, and more bugs. Molotov just passes through the floor and at random fire arrow will not have a prompt to light it. Lighter has more range than torches or any light source,  and enemies can spot your lighter from half a mile away‚Ä¶once alerted they start running back and forth in a circle between their initial spawn spot and a little bit short from where you stand indefinitely. Enemies are so easy to exploit and kill, but they do offer quite a bit of challenge when combat works. Day and Night cycles don‚Äôt matter anymore, sleeping is bad since it immediately makes us thirsty and hungry. So the game is mostly about going above to get resupplied and making progress in the caves, there is no way to switch between the two maps so you‚Äôll have to just remember the geology. There is no UI to keep you up on anything, I totally missed so many items and lost at times because of the chase, for almost 10 hours there was nothing but backtracking since the game does a terrible job at aiding you to progress - as I said before, it expects you to know things and it doesn‚Äôt want to end by helping you find anything, everything has to be memorised. 

Is it a bad game? No, so is it good? Almost. My take on it is if you have a lot of time to spare with friends it is a great game. It did a terrible job at keeping me engaged, everything is there but you‚Äôll have to find the meat of it yourself which takes a lot of time. The story content of the game is around 30 minutes, but it took me 20+ hours to find it without help. As an overview, the land above is for base building and fun, while the caves underneath are for the story. For the price these can even be two separate games, so the game deserves the asking price. Personally, it falls down where certain aspects of the game feel underdeveloped. Eating and drinking could have done more than just filling up a meter, sleeping is not worth it, sanity‚Ä¶got no clue. Stats improvements seem to require cutting down trees‚Ä¶hundreds of them, not sure if it does anything. There is no NPC to interact with, no dialogues, no notes, the only sense of progression is when finding unique gears. The game doesn‚Äôt even let you know when it ends so you can roam around the desolate place for all your life. It was fun but most of the time I just wanted it to end.

Edit: Changing to Positive. While the game does lack at explaining itself, it was mostly fun after understanding the core mechanics and of course less tedious since I know what was going on."
28525,Its pretty good with friends 7.5/10
28526,"The Forest is a good game. To put it shortly, I think that this game is worth the money, especially with a group of friends to play with to mask the flaws of the game.

THE ISSUES:

The biggest problem for me in the forest was the lack of surprise factor when playing the game. Over the first few hours of gameplay, everything seemed new and completely unexpected. See that huge-ass monster? What is that thing? Over time though, that feeling seemed to fade away and nothing was left to replace what was previously so surprising and evoked the feeling of, ""What the hell is that?"" The cannibals were never really scary or anything, they just kinda watch you and if you smack them in the face they run away and don't fight. The cannibal villages were also very lazily made in my opinion, no beds, just a tent and dirt, sometimes there wouldn't even be anything in them. Only really the main cannibal village was interesting in my opinion, but it still needed a lot of work. The animal enemies were really bad, like the crocodile, who was nothing more than just a blind and deaf old lady who walks into your house sometimes. Aside from that. the game overall seemed to have a large emphasis on the building aspects of the game, but I didn't really care too much about building something cool or interesting, me and my friends just built what we wanted to and left it at that. The amount of content available post-game is also something that needs a bit of work. Like yeah, you can spend hours of your time scrounging for the hidden pistol, wait a bunch of time to fight the worm fella (24 real-life hours, btw), build a huge house, but the problem with all of those is that they are tasks that are meant to take a while inherently, like a goal that is being worked towards just by playing the game. The problem comes when you beat the game with your friends on like day 20, have already done all of the caves, beaten the main story, and there just seems like nothing else to do. There is no reason for to try to make a better house than I already have, because there is nothing that even threatens my house. There is nothing left to explore, nothing left to collect, nothing left to see, and therefore achieve. Those are the biggest problems in my opinion.

THE GOODS:

The Forest is not a bad game, even though I might seem critical of it. I really like the atmosphere, outside, in the caves, everywhere pretty much. The combat felt pretty nice too, even though the bow felt kinda odd and I never bothered to get the gun because ammo is so limited for it (also annoying to get). The final area was really nice too, the contrast between it and the rest of the game was cool. The enemies were also really cool, too, I really enjoyed discovering a bunch of wacky creatures that really made me back up and go, ""The hell was that?"" I think that this game is best played with friends, because a lot of things in this game would be a lot less interesting if there wasn't someone else with you. Searching for caves, which is pretty much the goal of the game, is also a pain in ass if you don't have a few grunts (friends) helping you along the way. The Forest is a very on-your-toes kinda game, you don't know when something might jump you out in the woods, or what that thing might be. I think that really summarized my experience."

28529,"Amazing Game!

28541,"Good Game, tp serem anj!!!"
28542,"Updated review from recommended to not recommended. Glitchy af.

I loved the game at first. I'm new to the crafting/survival genre but sadly the game is riddled with glitches making it unplayable.

I spent a lot of time crafting and building out the map, which was fun, found some glitches but nothing that impacted too much.

That all changed today. Basically after spending days of my real life building out the map, my structures are just falling apart for no reason. I will load a save and half a structure will be gone.

Because this is the main appeal of the game... it's extremely frustrating and makes it feel pointless. It's unintentionally become the Dark Souls glitch that makes the game way more difficult.

I have only had one other game that I loved and stopped playing--Dead Island--and I stopped because randomly my save reverted back to a week or two previous, and I didn't feel motivated to redo everything on the chance it might not glitch out again.

There are full lists of glitches out there for this game, and you kind of put up with most of them if they don't impact the game. For example:
1)Arrows, spears and other weapons disappearing when you try to pick them up
2)Fire not being able to be lit when you have just built it
3)Building things in places where they don't work (e.g. a climbing rope goes lower than the ground, therefore you can't climb up it)
4)Corpses and trees disappearing early

Most of these you can kinda push through or workaround. The bigger ones were
1)Can't raise your weapon to block in some circumstances
2)You can jump or fall into parts of the image that you can't get out of, meaning you have to reload from a save. I guess they call this clipping.
2)By design, you may switch weapons when you don't want to--for example, while holding your weapon to block
3)By design you die quickly from fire--however enemies don't die after being burned multiple times
4)By design, your armor doesn't last at all very long in normal mode
5)By design, if you start building something and cancel it, you lose all materials that went into it.

All in all, I would have given the game and 8/10, but now I'm thinking 5/10 would be pretty generous. I got it on sale too I think, but at this point I feel like I've wasted my life on a game that doesn't play by its own rules.

Hope the devs can make a stable build of this sometime."

I have not yet completed the story, as it is very, very long, but the graphics look incredible, the gameplay is intuitive and not repetitive, and getting even just 2 buddies along for the ride makes this one of the most fun experiences I have EVER had. MUST BUY. (sometimes suitcases will randomly go flying.)"
28585,"Love this game! The graphics are pretty good and so is the audio. Can't say too much on the story because I get so distracted by trying to build an awesome base and keep it away from enemies but so far its pretty interesting. This is not a game I would play on hard the first run through because even on normal I've died a considerable amount of times. Definitely best played in a dark room with the audio all the way up. Its really a unique game, the mix of horror, survival, mystery and exploration is deeply interesting and will definitely keep you playing for awhile. I wouldn't recommend this game for children or young teenagers.

28649,"if you have free time in your hands and you're looking for a decent survival craft game then the forest is a game that you should really dive into. 
I had so much fun playing it in both solo and with friends, so after having enough hours on it, I finally decided to give it a review
[b]Gameplay:[/b]
as you may expect, you will be collecting food, drinks and going for alternative ways like hunting and saving water to maintain your energy while exploring around and spending a fair amount of time cutting down trees, also finding and crafting equipment that could make your life kinda easier and also weapons to protect you against cannibals attacks¬† 
[b]Enemies and difficulty:[/b]
the more days you survive the harder it goes and the more creatures and cannibals appears to attack you or try to destroy your base and at times you will be forced to defend it or move on and explore the map  
speaking of it, I really love how smart and unpredictable the behaviour of cannibals here, it really feels realistic so kudos to the devs :) 
[b]Graphics and atmosphere:[/b]
for a crafting game it looks very good I must say, and I really loved the environment, when I finished building a cabin and sit in front of the fire at night it felt like I was really there haha
(you may still want to adjust the graphics and filters to your preference)
[b]Story and replyability:[/b]
the story was added later and it can be or can't be long depending on how you play the game, I found it decently good but once I finished I felt like I lost a purpose of playing the game, so my advice is to not focus much on it
as for replyability I wouldn't mind replaying it with friends, some people will stick around especially if they are having fun with building and getting creative so it varies from a person to another. ‚Äã
[b]conclusion:[/b]
when I first got it I didn't expect much but I was really impressed uh well except for the cheaters who joined and tried to ruin everything when I set the lobby to public, but anyway if you feel like you're in the mood to give it a go then do not hesitate on picking it up!"

28654,"like the graphics, interesting terrain, crafting a bit clunky, but once you are used to it, is fine.  cannibals are scary!"
28655,ate a cannibal
28656,"this game is super realistic and very fun to play with or without friends. theres so many secrets behind it and the lore is amazing, it also contains some thriller/horror in it.its a very good survival/horror game and is deffinetaly too cheap, totally worth it."

28683,"This is a very good hore game
"
28684,"This game is honestly one of the best Survival games i have ever played, While i wish the multiplayer was a little more active for solo play and two to three players is comfortable. It allows for players to have a completely immersive game-play. The only draw backs in this game is the combat feels a little off on hit boxes (enemies are a little too easy to hit) and the stamina seems to run out quickly but if you keep yourself fed and with plenty of water there is no problem. The only other thing I can think of is the stun locking of enemies when it comes to Fire arrows, def makes it metta when fighting more then one enemy. Overall 10/10 would buy and play again though. The devs have made a very good game for those interested in survival games last complaint is with a little bit of the back story. The game seems to be lacking in content but the wild adventures and building make up for it. I know my steam account says 11 hours but i have hundreds on my alt account and always come back to kill some mfs every now and again. I would like to see a single action shotgun or some new weapons in the game maybe a utility vehicle that has to be built much like the pistol!"

28763,I like
28764,It was really enjoyable although it was a bit short. I do think that building a base is kinda useless and I would have preferd it to have more of a use. Besides that. the game was amazing
28765,"The Forest is an enjoyable co-op experience, but isn't polished at all.
We've encountered many bugs and problems during our playthrough.

[h1]1. Story[/h1]
The Forest won't offer a narrated story. You need to find tiny bits of information hidden within the world. As much as I like game like these, it's a needle in a haystack. Even if you find every tiny piece of story, it‚Äôs confusing. Nothing is really explained. You can vaguely guess, but ultimately everything is a mystery, which I find rather disappointing.

[h1]2. Gameplay[/h1]
[h2]2.1 Fights[/h2]
Fighting enemies is more or less fun at first, but get very tedious in the long run.
While shooting arrows with bows work fine, melee weapons feel weird in the beginning. It took time to compensate woolly attack patterns. Once you learned how to kill enemies it‚Äôs rather hard to die.
[h2]2.2 Building[/h2]
The tree chopping mechanic is enjoyable. Gathering resources is easy and slightly tedious, but no big deal. Building anything works good most of the time, but I dislike the ""building menu"" as much as I dislike the inventory. It's hard to find anything within it.
Any bigger structure needs logs from trees. The bigger the structure, the more you need. But enemies will just destroy anything they see, so you will likely lose parts of your base. Buildings have almost no purpose, which makes it really sad to see your decoration and enormous amount of time you put into it just go -poof-.
[h2]2.3 Exploring[/h2]
As good as the game looks, whether it is overground or underground, the island you‚Äôre on will only offer a few things to see. Especially, caves look almost all the same.

[h1]3. Conclusion[/h1]
The forest is a massive time sink with too many small and medium-sized problems.
In all objectivity, the game does not deserve a positiv nor negative review.
But my disappointment weighs it down to a negativ review."

    For a start, make a house in the tree or a house on the water to avoid the attacks of cannibals, to sleep you can make a tent of the leaves (the leaves fall when you cut trees). As a food source, I suggest making a combined spear from two sticks and throwing it after animals or catching fish. For water, you can drink from any pond or use the turtle carpace combined with 4 sticks and catch rainwater. Don't forget to star fire and fry the meat."

28961,"scary and anooying  because of cannibals spawning every 5 minutes around your base that you tried to make for 6 hours buttttttttt adventurous so i like


Okay... so i learned that you need to find a good spot for your base (around the river and some rocks)  but don't forget to make the wall!


it is getting exciting  0_0"
28962,boss baby
28963,"hours and hours of gameplay!!! addictive and fun (actually scary). best if played in teams of 3+ players. i mean, you can play with 2 players as well but base building will slow you down significantly"

28972,"This game is pretty good to be honest, I've only played it for 4 hours
but I've been having a blast playing this with my buddies. 

Here is a status for what we've done so far in the game, well
we found a medium sized rock in the middle of a lake, we decided
to make our base on that rock. So we placed a foundation and then we
placed a bridge over the lake so we could get to our home without
swimming or building a small raft. We cut down trees for about 1,5 hours
so we could build the bridge and foundation. We didn't meet any cannibals
until we reached the 3,5 hour mark. Good base spot, game is 10/10"

29040,Wholesome ending.
29041,Stressful lol if you really put yourself in your character's shoes this game should weird you out pretty bad. I've only played alone and in the normal setting. I'll be doing whatever and all of a sudden i see them. And sometimes they just look at me and grumble to each other. Other times when they decide to come greet me is when it gets bad. Like mind games bad. I don't want to go into detail and ruin anything but this is some majorly freaky weird actually if you think about it could happen and probably has happened in real life stuff. Dont let the beauty of the forest trick you. Stay on your toes. Dont waste the daylight. They are watching you!

The great:
- Multiple and appropriate difficulty levels (including sandbox)
- Animations are outstanding
- Full player agency
- Some areas and sounds literally give me goosebumps
- Building and crafting is fully immersive and well designed

The good:
- Good realism
- Engaging multiplayer
- Decently large map
- Low price in 2021

The bad:
- The sequel ""Sons of the Forest"" comes out in mid 2022, making this game less of a value as time goes on.
- Combat is janky and not that fun
- Game minimizes when tabbing to another window"

29126,"Great survival/horror game. Good mechanics, multiplayer functionality, and story. Crafting mechanics in this game are different, and good in my opinion, as you can place items to be crafted and then start to build them without any materials on hand. This allows a player to piece-mill building as one might do in a true survival situation. I received this game as a gift from friend to play with. I have not been compensated for my review."
29127,I have played for 6 hours and I am enjoying how the game is showing how my presents is effecting the world around me. I have found many pieces to the story but I am still trying to figure out this islands function. Good game solid if you like horror survivor.

29178,"Has a few bugs and some items are plain bad or useless (for example the upgraded rock, which lights YOURSELF on fire whenever you hit something[!?], or the bomp, which has an exploding radius of an Inch), and most of the caves you need to do to get special items, like the Chainsaw or Katana are a bit too easy while some, like the cave of the modern recurve bow is a fairly big cave with acceptable difficulty. 
Exept for that the game is a really fun one to play with friends -I dont like playing it by myself, because I get scared by mutants easily- and it has some interesting features. The graphics are extremely good even on bad PCs, but the game has some trouble with handeling 2 Monitors, at least for me, because it tabbes out sometimes even though I am in the game. There are also a few cute details, like a birb landing on the arm of the Character or spiders crawling away after picking up a rock. 
Over all this game is very good and fun to play. I highly recommend playing it and I look forward to the release of Sons of the Forest."
29179,"In a word, ""Adult Horror Minecraft""!

Scary as hell, especially at night. Barely managed to build a small log hut, starving, cold, thirsty and standing in the darkness in the corner of my hut not daring to breath for fear ""they"" will hear me. 

Who are ""they""? They caught me once but I escaped, stole some of their stuff and ran.

29224,"Best ai in any game, the enemies feel like real people. The story is engrossing and interesting, and the graphics are incredible. A little buggy tho"
29225,yes
29226,a
29227,this game is fun and scary. i rate it pg-13
29228,A really great game. I had a really fun time playing this with friends and following though the story line. I highly recommend this to anyone who is wanting to get into the world of spoopy gaming!
29229,"This game is one of the only horror games I've played that has actually made me feel scared at times. The feeling of always being watched is creepy and in my first playthrough I was on edge the whole time. The gameplay is fun and the story (if you even pay attention to it) is somewhat interesting. Each cave felt unique and I felt a sense of accomplishment whenever I made it through and got a cool new tool or weapon.

I think that some people get a feeling of being mislead by the game's presentation as a basic survival game and then get bored because they run out of stuff to build, but in my eyes the limitation on that kind of stuff is more of a signal that you should go actually try to beat the game. And even then, there's so much that you can build with the different custom buildings and the hidden blueprints that are underwater.

One thing that bugged me was that there's no autosave and you have to individually save characters at a bed for each person playing in multiplayer. This was a big problem because one of my friends that I played with would randomly disconnect because of his internet connection and then lose all of his progress since we were last at our base. It was very annoying and something that I hope will be improved on or even removed altogether in the sequel.

Overall, I think this is my favorite survival game of all time and I would recommend to anyone that is looking for something to do."

29232,"One of the best coop survival games I have played.  The game play, building, and story are all amazing.  I have been searching for a game that delivers this well, but have yet to find one."

10/10. great game. totally recommend it."
29243,A LOT OF FUN CANT WAIT FOR THE SEQUEL
29244,My friend killed me with a falling tree
29245,It's an interesting game but gets really boring after some time. And besides it feels like the developers just made some quick weird ending on this game so they could get rid focusing on it. I guess the game can be fun for some people I played it with my friend and i think that is what it made mostly entertaining
29246,.
29247,"Very good game 
Had much fun playing it 
"
29248,Each Time I play I feel compelled to build a Kong Wall. Love the Game.

29290,"its a good game, the night is pretty scary and cannibals can be really persistent, the caves are creepy too, overall good survival game if your looking for something thats a bit more hands on and buildy"
29291,its a fun survival game with or without friends.  trying to defend your base from cannabals/mutants is fun and you need to strategize how you build your base/defenses and also i wish this game got more updates/bug fixes because its kind of buggy at times.

29299,"Wonderful graphics, plenty big and interesting world, plenty of hunting, danger and cannibals to kill, good structure building and object making tools once you learn how to do it. And challenging quests. Character control works good. Fun in both single and multiplayer mode. One thing I don't like is the save game feature. You must build a shelter or find the right tent to do a save. So, if you spend an hour exploring a cave or forest  then die, you've lost an hour or more of game time. The sleep feature is a nice touch. If it is night and you are in a shelter you can sleep the night away in a few seconds. I say it's worth buying."

I love that you can entirely ignore the ""missions"" and just mess around when you want. Tons of building options, varied and fun combat, and an interesting story. Extremely fun to play with friends!"

There's a good balance of survival elements. There's definitely high potential for jump scares, as the enemies aren't always noisy in their approach and can sneak up on you. Lots of fun in general!"

29360,"Not for the faint of heart.

[h1]The pros :[/h1]

- Probably the best building system I've ever played. So much freedom !
- The ambience is amazing.
- One of the few first-person games that did melee combat right.
- Complete freedom, you can ignore the story completely if you want and still get many many hours of fun.
- Good both in solo or coop. Different vibe for each, solo is more intense and spooky. Coop takes away the spook factor, but adds more fun and allows for crazy building projects.
- Pretty impressive AI.
- Cannibals are incredible. From their looks, sounds, screams and growls, to their behaviour, the devs really did an amazing job designing them.
- The world is well designed, after some experience every area is easily recognisable and you almost never need to use the in-game map (which is terrible anyway).
- Cave exploration is quite unique.

[h1]The cons :[/h1]

- Some bugs were never fixed and most likely never will be.
- For a survival game, hunger and thirst quickly become a non-issue when you have a bit of experience.
- Cave exploration can be weird : too often the most dangerous areas are the most unrewarding.
- In Hard Survival mode, the calories system is poorly done, because of the sudden 6am reset. Especially since there is no way to tell what time it is when you're in a cave (despite the game being filled with wristwatches, pretty ironic).
- The weapon upgrade system doesn't make any sense at all.
- The system for quickslotting items is very obscure and not explained anywhere. You have to combine your backpack with the item you want to quickslot from the inventory screen, just weird. Thank god for search engines, I would have NEVER figured it out.
- Ironically the flashlight is the worst light source in the game
- Some areas of the world are too empty"
29361,Super fucking fun
29362,"Would highly recommend this game.. it's so creepy. The map is huge. At the beginning it is hard as you have no idea what you are doing and basically no guidance at all (on how to craft, what to craft, what to do) but once you get the hang of things it gets a bit easier in that aspect, but the creeps get bigger and badder. Much fun. Also got it on sale so worth it even more."
29363,"Great game with simple story and mechanics, two things I disliked though. One is that after finishing the game, if you pick one of two options, you don't actually get the achievement. The second one is more of a personal problem. Without guides, the weapons and tools in caves are tedious and annoying to find. However, this is a minor issue that is not relevant when talking about how good the game actually is. 8/10, definitely recommended."
29364,"Amazing survival horror game. Gives really good scares.
Amazing exploration.
Amazing story/ plot line.
Cannot wait for the sequel."
29365,"Did you know that in the May 30th 1990 edition of the Garfield comic strip, Jon Arbuckle drinks dog semen? It's true, Jim Davis says that it's a protein drink to help pregnant animals but frankly I think Jim Davis is a fucking liar, fuck you Jim you can't even write a single adult joke without backtracking? I expected more out of the artistic integrity of my daily newspaper comic strips, Jim. Instead you play me like this, play me like a fool who doesn't know what dog semen is. Well Jim I know what dog semen is and you can't hide it from me."

29390,No more trees
29391,"The forest. Released by the developer team Endnight Games Ltd, their early work was little too new wave for my taste, but when The Forest came out in 2014, I think it really came out on its own, both comerically and artistically. The whole game has clear crisp horror aspect, and a new sheen of professionalism that really gives the game a big boost.

As a whole, I highly recommend this game, especially if you'd like to enjoy a good horror game with friends, and I'd even suggest that you don't search up the answers on the internet since it's more fun to find them yourself."
29392,"BUTTERSCOTCH SAUCE INSTEAD OF ANAL CREAM, CREMATION OF THE MALE GENITALS!!!!!"
29393,"I was supposed to find my son but... Building ridiculous and over the top shelters is waaayyy better than parenting! 
Also don't make my mistake. You CANNOT make friends with the villagers. For your safety do not try to give these villagers hugs. They will eat you."

29399,"i didnt know that if you died or got knocked out outside a cave that it would set me back 10 days in game worth of work and time
immediately lost me and any time investment I had in the game and uninstalled the end
not to sound like a little b*** but stuff like that should maybe in an info area before hand? I mean it was my first run in the game and i was doing great but to me you just immediately loose me the moment you make me spend 3 hours doing everything I just did all over again, ya no."

29414,UPDATE?
29415,Great game to play by yourself
29416,yes
29417,kapsas duria kojas
29418,simply better than minecraft
29419,it is cool
29420,I like beating up naked cannibals.
29421,So bad you could not eat the babys
29422,Nice game..
29423,Best Survival Game I've played for a while.
29424,loved it
29425,"Doing meth makes this game rather enjoyable, I can't speak on whether its good without... As I am an addict and never not on meth. Buy it."
29426,pp poo poo ooooooo
29427,I played this masterpiece in the past and decided to come back to it. I was not dissapointed at all. I really love it and I'm certain you problably will too. Give it a shot if you havent allready! :)
29428,best survival game for multiplayer
29429,The game is very fun to play with few friends. It does create a creepy play set and the caves are done pretty good. The ai is kinda dumb but  can kill you easily though.
29430,"Me and my friends decided to kill everything and start a cult.


It went well.

11/10
Would commit cannibalism again"
29431,Such an amazing single player and multiplayer. My friends and I had so much fun playing together. Great story line and really good survival base building.

29435,good game
29436,I enjoyed slicing up cannibals
29437,"fun,very fun with friends"
29438,"Hell to the yeah! Playing by yourself offers an immersive survival experience with an intriguing story however, playing with friends also offers unforgettable moments of terror and pride from evading cannibals and creatures to building colossal bases with the social element which in my opinion, makes gameplay more fun social. For the price, it's worth every penny. Play offline though if you're playing by yourself to avoid people coming in to crash and destroy your world :P"
29439,"Good and realistic experience, best with friends, and can be pretty scary."
29440,"Great by yourself, better with mates"
29441,"Very good game, a lil too dark but great over all game :>

29463,fun game to play with a friend
29464,yah
29465,"I purchased this game in early access back in 2014, when all I had was a study laptop that ran it at 5 fps. Recently, with a new laptop, I've jumped back in again and, well, its amazing. The way the survival guide and backpack inventory interface are implemented is refreshing and intuitive. The base building is simple enough to get on with but allows for any degree of complexity. The physics and combat are both satisfying and brutal. All in all, the best survival horror of its type that I have encountered, and a fantastic game to play with a friend(s)."
29466,Just like real life the child is just a second thought
29467,hjbi
29468,"Best game that i have ever played!!
I would recommend this game for sure!!"
29469,Best surviving game!
29470,I like watching my friends drag cannibals into the base and do unspeakable acts.

29472,Fun game until your friends starting being too obsessed about building

29480,"Love the hotties!
"
29481,"Despite the numerous amount of bugs that plague multiplayer and collectibles, it was still a super fun game to play with friends as you traverse the desolated island and caves while fighting cannibals and messing around with structures. Definitely would grab it on sale if you're planning on playing with other people.

As the only other survivor on the island once told me,
""cannibal lives matter"" 
-XYZ"
29482,fun
29483,"mata suge pula
"
29484,The Map feels empty af and gameplay felt clunky with lots of bugs but was fun for awhile i guess

29491,weird but cool
29492,this game gud i can kill cnanibal with frend anD KILL FIRNED ahahahha
29493,"Absolutely would recommend to everyone. Some bugs, but a great game."
29494,"amazing game, needs some work on bug fixes tho"
29495,ok
29496,"I love this game with all of my heart. Exploring the wilderness is a refreshing experience and the pve system keeps the game fun and exciting. No other game until now has given me the same feeling as when you first wake up in minecraft but I think the forest comes the closest of any other game has gone to giving me that feeling again. learning to build, explore, craft, and fight is captivating and it gets even more fun with friends. Also has surprisingly good story (if you look for it). The end of the game is amazing as is everything inbetween. 10/10 definitely worth the money."
29497,literally one of the most addicting games i have ever played
29498,i have more time killing cannibals than saving timmy 10/10

I then proceed to find a cool ass hole and get to close to the edge, proceed to fall about 25m, shatter my legs and find myself tied up, upside down, in a cave. I look around after cutting myself down I find a few human skulls and find out I can use them as weapons, I then beat the shit out a local, steal a tooth right out of his skull and then get swarmed by the rest of his family and die for good. and thats how I lost my first save after only 20 mins"

29608,"I've spent a lot of time playing and spectating this game, definitely a fun time! The building and survival aspect isn't anything unique these days, but it has a really nice UI. The enemy is really unique for a survival game, though! It's improved a ton over the years, and it finally feels like a complete game. Admittedly, I don't love the story, but it's so much fun even if you ignore it and just focus on survival! Multiplayer is also a blast - and makes things easier, of course. 7/10"
29609,epic
29610,It's a fun game to play with some friends and the learning curve is small.
29611,gaming?
29612,gud gaem :D UwU
29613,It's cool lol
29614,"fun game with friends, a bit too easy, wish there were harder enemies"
29615,paint huffer mental problems utah boy double D ruined everything
29616,"this game is a great horror game with decent AI interesting lore , goals that make sense, i enjoy playing multiplayer but the true horror must be played in single player but the horror is not extreme and game feels rewarding  to make progress all around a good game
7.6/10"
29617,MEN
29618,Before I Played This Game I Had No Life Now I Have Mustard
29619,"Super fun game, specially when playing with friends. There's a few glitches here and there, but nothing game breaking. I usually hate zombies, but the forest might be the only exception. Lots of jumpscares, extremely addictive."
29620,This game is an amazing and quality game. I have only played it for a while but its a real experience.
29621,REALLY FUN
29622,"its a great game and i cant wait for sons of the forest to come out, my favorite thing is the ending"
29623,
29624,cool game but scary lol
29625,so good so nice
29626,"Totally WORTH! Best played with friends. teamwork, betrayals and stupid moments with the island locals makes it feel so good. Cave exploration makes you feel like indiana jones/tomb raider. Hunt the cannibals and raid their villages (WOMB RAIDERS)."
29627,Very fun open world survival game.
29628,Yes.
29629,its aight
29630,yes just yes
29631,I love the ape people<3
29632,"Even at minimum setting the mouse sensitivity is unplayable high and seemingly unfixable without a third party program of some sort. Complaints about this issue go back to the game's inception with no fix. Visual clutter in the form of building icons grossly obstructs vision, teammate crafting spams the mic of everyone ingame, and overall the game plays and feels like a tech demo for the sequel."
29633,Fun game for with friends
29634,very good with friends
29635,yeah im lost
29636,watch out for big mutants and angry caniballs (get it balls?)

29650,"got raped by a bunch of cannibals, would recommend 10/10 very enjoyable."
29651,better than rust
29652,It's adventure and fun to play with friends at the same time!
29653,Super dope
29654,Big naked women chase you 10/10
29655,very scare
29656,Nope.
29657,Yes
29658,"I just binge played this game for 22 hours in two days. It is sooo fun to play with friends, but if you're playing alone its more of a horror game. I would still recommend if you're playing alone or with friends 10/10 would recommend."
29659,
29660,18/10 bussin game- Enjoyed all the free food I got when defending my territory against the fellow other cannibals on the island! Thick thighs saved lives a multitude of times on this game! Can't wait for The Forest 2 :)
29661,"I recommend that.

The game is very peacefull.
Not scary at all.
Cannibalism is every day routine. 
You can play solo or with friends.
Exploration is fun and great time killer while writing your college assigment.
So there is a lot of reason to play that very peacefull, not scary, family-friendly  game.

I recommend with my heart.
Really there is my heart --> üß° 
There are my last words üíÄ"
29662,"good game, much love"

29671,great survival game.   cool a.i. that pose a rare challenge.  you have to search and find tools to use and progress via exploring caves and defeating a.i. tribes.   cool game.
29672,"Wait, I have a son I need to rescue?"
29673,its a spoky but very fun game to play with friends
29674,A less blocky Minecraft
29675,"Best co-op open world survival story game on the market, if you have a friend to play with don't even hesitate to buy this game. 11/10. Also, steal their food off the drying rack."

29682,Just a brilliant game. Even better with friends.
29683,"Fun game, coming from a nerd who has only played for 58 minutes. If you like vr and normal gameplay then cool!"
29684,Great game for you and some friends to play. I personally enjoy it as it can be really fun and funny!

"
29690,"This Game is so well developed it has some bugs but its manageable. I started playing it for the survival aspect, but now i'm interested in the whole story."
29691,yes
29692,"very fun, but bad if you have no friends. So this game is bad. Please download and play with me"
29693,mmm tasty cannibals
29694,"Building, running, killing crazy zombie ppl!! So much fun!"
29695,good
29696,good game
29697,"you can murder babies 10/10
"
29698,"Considering the very cheap prices you can find this game for, it's 100% worth it. The graphics are good, it doesn't take long at all to be building your base. Whilst it's more than playable solo, it's even better if you have friends to play it with."

29700,fuck timmy
29701,poggers
29702,"So this game was very, (what is the word) very, interesting.  I could not deal with the Large Penis worm thingy. 
It freaked me out, made me think of my last boyfriend (creepy much, tell me about it.) So anyways, The game play was Decently OK, hitting things was annoying but you still got it.  I have yet to finish the game, but I keep running into creepy large Things that creepy me out. 
Will only play with friends, because its boring with out.
"
29703,this is the funnest survival game ive ever played its my fav genre and ive played alot i do recommend
29704,"What a horrifying experience honestly what the f***

>spawn in crashed plane

>4-5 surround me
>knocked down by cannibals
>pulled into cave

>heart attack
>instantly die

I absolutely love it."
29705,yes much
29706,Forest is a great game. F**k Duncan!
29707,"Does what it is supposed to do keep you on the edge of starvation running for your life, looking for meds to heal up, good if you are looking for an edge of the set survival. but it would be nice to have custom game play setting, like how long it takes before you need to eat or drink, what enemies there are and how strong they are, but still fun to play, especially with friends."
29708,"i fucking love this fucking game, fuck yeah"
29709,yes
29710,"Great game, best survival game!"
29711,its a fun game
29712," I came into this game with an expectation, and to put it plainly, this game blew my fucking mind. Graphics are crisp, realistic, and beautiful. Combat is responsive, sharp, and intense. Building is fun, maliable, and creative. This whole game is so damn good. Playstyles vary heavily from a peaceful, jogging-through-life style, to a badass Doom- AC feel. Godly. Holy shit there is so much to this game and so much to do. With other classic games like MC, COD, and SS falling out this was a great pick to play. Worth your time and money."
29713,nope
29714,it was fun
29715,tree

29754,"Hands down, amazing game. Graphics can be a bit wonky sometimes depending on the lag but the story line and overall game play is so good. 9/10 game highly recommend."
29755,this game is amazing!!!!!

29757,I saw a lost man walking naked in the woods.
29758,The life in this forest is a walk on the beach and I am eating the sand

29760,little bit creepy but honestly really fun awesome survival game
29761,really good game if you like to grind
29762,Not allowed to eat children.
29763,"Super atmospheric in singleplayer.
And lots of fun in multiplayer.

After Speedrunning the game 5x, Obtaining all the achievements and 2 save files with 100+ days, I can say this game is an absolute gem.
Awesome AI, great idea and gameplay way better than other games of that time or price.
I'm looking forward to May/20/2022.

-Toast"
29764,"Awesome game, funner with two or more players!"

29796,master tree chopper
29797,amazing with friends
29798,"100% cannot go wrong with the game, mad  fun just exploring and building bases. Capturing natives in traps and putting them in a cage if you feel like it. 

You can be on the good side of the natives or bad side depending on how you play. The AI is actually pretty intelligent, they move and react to you in ways that feel different from any other game.

I can't wait to play the second game coming out, I have never wanted a game so badly. It is killing me being patient.

"
29799,BEST horror/survival game ever. Played this all the way back in the super buggy Alpha/Beta and before Steam Achievements were even a thing. Had all the cave systems mapped out and knew exactly where to go for the story items. Amazing story and is very fulfilling. I hope this studio will continue to make more games.
