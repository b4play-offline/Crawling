8,"Nawet fajny ten CS w singlu, ale wypadało by go trochę poprawić."
9,Counter-Strike with lore. I love it.
10,This was the first counter-strike game that I've ever played.
11,brony easter egg. do not purchase.
12,honestly great even though there was story to follow.
13,better than gta 5 story
14,"Simple the best single player Counter-Strike experience, nuff said."
15,Can confirm this is way better than CS : CZ
16,Good
17,a delightful little shooting gallery
18,Very nice game about CS. Feels more like Half-Life but have CS movement and weapons. Pretty good for a free game which come with condition zero and 1.6.
19,"If your curious what this is, it's a half life campaign for Counter Strike chopped up into shorter scenario's using mostly reskinned hecu soldiers as the basis for all the enemies you encounter.

Most of the game is pretty great to enjoy, aside from a few difficulty spikes in a few scenario's. But it's nice to experience what could've been the singleplayer going forward for CS itself."

Definitely an imperfect game, but still worth a play through

22,cool gam
23,Is cool
24,"Fun game, reminds me more to hl1 than cs tbh"
25,"The single-player projects that Valve develops have always appealed to me far more than their multiplayer games which is why it is so interesting to see the framework of Counter-Strike be applied to a single-player campaign. The actual game is well-made and while as a whole it feels very disjointed, most missions are a lot of fun and have a new settings, gameplay mechanic, etc. to keep everything fresh."

54,Approved

56,"Great game, it really shows you how a CS game with story should look. I hope Valve consider remaking it with the new Source 2."
57,Most fun I ever had since 2014.
58,I kinda hated the part where you had to raid the Tower because I kept getting shot up by the gunners and the snipers.
59,"There's not overarching story, just a bunch of levels.
Often times you'll find yourself not knowing how to proceed from an area.
Ammo is scarce so there were missions I had to finish using only my knife a prayer.
Enemies most of the times aim-bot you and spawn behind you (in areas that you made sure you cleared)
It has a Half-Life vibe to it but it's not very high in quality."

68,"its fucking gay ass game the enemy positioning makes me want to jump off a building and i hate that you have to make checkpoints every 2 fucking seconds because it always spawns a dude with a rocket launcher and a sniper in the same fucking place and it just makes me want to kill myself

75,"For people who like Counter-Strike's gunplay but want a single-player experience, or for players who primarily play single-player games who want to learn what CS is like on a mechanical level before jumping in online, Condition Zero: Deleted Scenes is entertaining enough to be worth at least one playthrough in spite of some glaring difficulty spikes; just treat each level as a standalone mission rather than all the levels being connected to some over-arching narrative."
76,"The gameplay was fun at times but you're better off just playing CS:GO. It has better graphics, gameplay, and mechanics. This is just the worst version in every way but it has a story attached. The story really isn't interesting or worth it in any way. I did want to off myself from some rage-inducing moments but I couldn't push past mission 6 after I was ""too late"" with the extraction. If you have a lot of patience go ahead, it's a hard pass otherwise, 4/10."
77,Good campaign!
78,"Brings back childhood memories, its fun if u have time to waste."
79,Yes
80,I honestly wish this was finished
81,It had a campaign?!?
82,I don't really recommend this game. After completing all the missions there is nothing left to do.

88,yes
89,"Think of this game as a call of duty campaign version of counter strike.

You can finish the game pretty quickly and there's little to none replay value so if it goes on sale, feel free to buy it if you want to waste a couple of hours shooting npc targets."

91,"I like the story-based gameplay of CS:CZ - the ability to join various Counter-Terrorist forces across the globe and fight terrorism in various settings. Reasonably challenging with ""Half-Life"" kind of playing style. CS fanboys should give this a try."
92,"the campaigns are fun, and the m72 is literally the most fun weapon to use, especially if you rocket jump with it.
"
93,"I wish counter strike games were all like this and had levels with plot and single player mode, as then i wouldn't need an internet connection and have to risk getting hacked by some a** with nothing better to do. But if you're going to have people from other countries can you get voice actors from these countries because i dont want to have to get my ears destroyed by an american guy screaming nonsense words in a fake japanese accent every 20 seconds or have to listen to the english man talking in what i thought was supposed to be Argentina"

HAHA'' no,  i had it on normal and i had no fun at all, i tried to say to myself all the time ''i think i will like this level'', and then i did not, i liked nothing at all and i understand why its called deleted scenes now, however i have yet to play normal retail which will be nothing like this, i hope."

110,"If you like CS you would definitely enjoy this one, bring back old memories, just buy it already. Still you need to have in mind that this is an old game so maybe lobbies are not as active as they used to."
111,It has some of the most creative environment design I have ever seen

120,"[h1] Counter-Strike: Condition Zero Deleted Scenes - Review[/h1]

Well, that was a surprise. I completely didn't expect this game to look like that. It is not Counter-Strike that everybody knows. It's a proper single-player campaign!
The storyline doesn't really exist - each missions is a separate scenario, which pretty much looks the same in each level: you play as a counter-terrorist, go in somewhere, kill the bad guys, maybe defuse a bomb at the end or rescue some hostages. Simple, yet fun. Unfortunately, the visual layer got old really quickly - the game is quite ugly. In terms of audio, it's alright. There is a lot of funny dialogue between ""not-the-smartest"" terrorists. Deleted Scenes is also filled with a a lot of easter eggs, so while being generally mature, it also makes the player laugh.

At the end of the day, I enjoyed those 9 hours I spent with CSCZDS (lol). It was a great experience and a nice stepping stone from the original formula of Counter-Strike."
121,"i beat a level while dead, them failed it, them the game sent me to the next operation, very great game"
122,counter-strike is a homoerotic game
123,a nostalgia trip you can experience even if you didn't play the game at all
124,Like a half life pretty good FPS
125,this game is fun
126,"Pretty good campaign actually, I'm kind of surprised, I wasn't expecting this from Counter-Strike."
127,"I Just Love This Masterpiece Of A Game Its My 4th Favorite Game For Counter Strike
Still I Will Take The Normal Basic Version Of CSCZ But This Is Like A Little Treat For CS Fans
Still Its Good"
128,"so far so good it's singleplayer CS with scripted events
kinda wish it had coop though..but everything else is very nice"
129,to be ready for online busting... pass the game on the hardest mode.
130,"Half-Life mod where you gib aimbotting terrorists all across the globe, really fun and action-packed!!"
131,this is terrible the whole game is ruined by the last mission (and more middle missions that are not fun) and bugs.  ive been playing on hard without getting stuck untill the alamo because i cant actualy shoot the enemies coming out without peeking into 2 angles and the rpg guy dosent die sometimes and because i have m4 and they prefire the shit out of you it cant be beaten unless you want to sit here for 2 hours and thats a chore not a game. what a fucking shame

135,"this is what condition zero should've been, not a dam reskin of cs 1.6"
136,"This will be probably my unique and serious review.

About mapping, SFX, ambience and weapons are 10/10
But bad of this game are their voices translated to spanish... are very steoripated and sounds SO absurd...
Another bad thing is don't let you freedom to make a mission, what I mean? For example, on a stealth map you can't decide to make it like ""Rambo way"" or different items like radio you can't use them freedomly too.

And last, missions sometimes are very repetitive and boring (especially mission of Miami with taking hostages, that mission is sh!t)

Anyway, I recommend it and had fun with it.

Bye."
137,"very entertaining and fun, i really liked the jet thing 
7 / 10"
138,¯\_(ツ)_/¯
139,Cool.
140,"The deleted scenes campaign is brilliant, a true Counter-Strike single player campaign. Ritual Entertainment's work here is much better than the bot matches labelled as a 'campaign' in the main game. This should have been in the main game and not hidden away. At least we can be glad it was even released at all and not just joined the pile of unreleased Valve projects. It also received an additional six missions in later updates that are playable from the World Map. If you're a Counter-Strike fan, give it a go."
141,very gud gaem i recommend to plae gaem caus ieat fun and funi moment
142,good game

The game itself became a Multiplayer classic, icon,

you want... this game is a masterpiece even if it's old, remastered
remade, people are gonna play it and love it... i was playing the original

Missions are cool, gun-play is of course amazing,game missions are action and also stealthy, there are more kind of special weapons and every one of them is unique.I played this game 3 times and i do not regret any second of playing it"
172,best cs ever
173,"If CS:GO had singleplayer missions, I'd certainly play it more.

It's like the Pre-Rainbow six siege Rainbow six games, but this time they've left the more ''tactical'' parts of it out the door and focused only on the gunplay and movie-like action."

182,"One actual history mode for CS, very nice, glitchy as hell but nice anyways"
183,"Not great, not terrible."
184,"This is what Counter Strike Condition Zero should have been instead of that crap the final product is. The game is basically a Call of Duty idea with Counter Strike mechanics. and I must say that the result isn´t as bad as I expected. There is no story itself cause you play as some agents from SAS, Spetsnaz, GSG 9 and SEAL trying to stop terrorism in different ways. However the game it´s really well done with 15/20 minutes missions. But the bad thing is that for a 2004 game the graphics and physics are outdated (Valve decision of making this the last GldnSrc game knowing that in 2004 Half Life 2 and Counter Strike Source would be released with Source Engine), and some missions can get repetitive (defuse bomb, rescue someone...). If you want to try a new kind of Counter Strike, buy it leaving the original Condition Zero forgotten. Otherwise just buy CS 1.6, Source or Global Offensive"
185,sigma chad game
186,best game of 2013!!!
187,f*** this game die 2000  *******************
188,"It's good. Decent map design,cool guns,ect."
189,CZ: Deleted Scenes is a campaign mode. pretty fun remidns me of half life
190,Mid.
191,haha HP laptop go BRRRRRRR
192,Great Campaign
193,its not global but i still took offense
194,Counter-Strike Condition Zero Deleted Scenes it's meaning to me a lot of time in offline mode because the internet end last day
195,With a graphics card this game doesn't disappoint. Handy to play with friends. Playing with computer though isn't boring or bad.
196,Call of Duty From Counter Strike world
197,Can be a test on hard level
198,cool
199,"No story, still nice Single Player CS which deserves a different name."
200,i played this game when my internet broke down its a old game but i rly enjoyed it ! amazing experience and a bit of nostalgia wish CS:GO had a campaign !
201,its so good
202,very good
203,good game tho really sad it went trought 4 developers to finish it and the relese of css didn't aid it either really sad faith
204,The campain is COD but its counter strike But the COD is COD 4
205,"Campaign is awful, gameplay's bad, gunplay's bad, there's no story, 99% of it is just clearing rooms with enemy behind p much every single corner, it gets boring after 1st mission and there's 6 hour of it 
Mission's are poorly designed, so are the locations in which the action takes places
Fuck it, i hate it.

Multi is fine, 1.6 but enhanced?"
206,Nice to have a story mode in cs
207,"Better than CoD campaigns these days that's for sure.

209," even though there are some parts of missions that are quite confusing, it's a bit challenging which makes it a fun game"
210,"Just play Half-Life again.
Unless you like wasting your time, in that case sure, play it. :)
a review isn't gonna stop you"
211,Terrible
212,Why wasn't this realesed instead of that crap.
213,yes
214,Old but good !!
215,based
216,remake this on source2 and it will be 11/10
217,"The deleted scenes are MUCH better than what was released, it feels more like an FPS than the non deleted scenes version, but sadly no multiplayer."
218,"This game has lots of points. Sometimes i just wanted to quit and play something else, others i was truly enjoying the gameplay.
The thing about it is it takes itself way too seriously. The missions are pretty straight forward, just keep moving onwards and killing enemies until you finish, with rare occasions of having to use your brain. The stealth missions, in the other way are EXTREMELY boring and frustrating, since it's just waiting and walking, with the enemies having eagle vision on you, sometimes seeing you through walls even.
The good points are for example when it let itself go and stop trying to be Counter Strike, and approximating more to a Half Life formula, which was pretty well done in mission 12, the skyscraper.
The game doesn't really have a story, it is just defending the world from terrorists, which is ok, and that is something you should know before buying.
Conclusion: it can be a nice fun for somebody who wants to play a cod-like game with a CS feeling, but the CS formula just fits way better when we are talking about Competitive multiplayer shooters."
219,"Even though it gets old fairly quick, it's still better than the missions included in the base game."
220,"This game had a very well put together campaign that felt like counter strike, but had really cool additional tools like the remote bomb and the blowtorch as well as a few others. It featured many maps from different places around the world, which were all really nice. Overall, a really fun and relatively shot story to play!"
221,"Possibly the worst, most broken, repetitive, bullshit game I have ever played. And I loved every second of it."
222,One of the best fps games....loved it!  Another great Valve Job!
223,Nostalgic!
224,"why shotgun bot op???
"
225,"Worst FPS game I've ever played! One of the worst mission design of this decade! CS was never a good FPS game and this game proves my point!

249,"This game was surprisingly fun and challenging at times. In some parts it was difficult to find where to go, but the game is good. Short but fun :)"
250,Condition zero but with deleted scenes
251,"Therapist: CS:CZ story mode does not exist, it can't hurt you !

CS:CZ story mode:"
252,"Allthough the puzzles are quite cryptic to find the solution of i would say that it was enjoyable to an extent
would recommed 7/10"

257,"funny how they made an entire game and was like, ""nah, lets not use this"" and made another game"
258,yes
259,"This game may not be fit in the franchise but i miss cs game like this. A cod-like campaigns. Fortunately though, they bring story mode into cs go operations and that's nice"
260,"The single-player campaign is actually quite fun, wish more CS games had it as a side content."
261,"this game is like l4d2:
what do u do when you get bored after beating it a thousand times?
mod the hell outta it."
262,It's CS:CZ but with a campaign and training missions.
263,"The Deleted Scenes campaign absolutely makes this worth it, honestly reminiscent of the single-player experience you find in OLD Battlefield 1. I kinda wish they remaster the whole story, it is so cool for history buffs interested in the happenings of global crime/terrorism in the late 80s through the 90s."
264,Nice !! :)
265,Good Game!
266,"Regarding the Deleted Scenes: I played this campaign about a decade ago, and it still holds up relatively well. A rather straightforward military FPS with familiar Counter Strike weapons.

If you're looking for a singleplayer FPS that plays like CS, this isn't quite it, but it's a nice bonus to what was otherwise a great expansion on the original CS 1.6.

Condition Zero as a whole package is great. It's a better CS 1.6 with much needed single player content and multiplayer with bots. Though I never actually got to play this game online before I got my hands on an internet connection and CS: Source, I can tell you had I spent a ton of hours having fun playing this game with my friends, brothers, and bots. Recommended if that's what you want to do with this game (read: play old school CS offline or on local LAN), however I would recommend CS: Source as the better alternative for both offline and online play."

270,please update this game with more story mode.
271,YES YES YES this is AMAZING its a counter strike single player what more do you want!?!
272,"Имхо, недооценённая и крутая часть CS. Хоть и миссии из разряда: иди туда, убивай врагов здесь, потом там. Но для своего времени вышло отлично."
273,Weird try to make a single player out of Counter Strike. It sucks.
274,Great classic that doesn't get the recognition it needs
275,GG
276,yes
277,This game feels like the half-life of the counter-strike version.
278,funi
279,Old good game any ways on this Steam if you bought this some at least 10 old games like Half-Life you get for free not like game Dear Ester and so on made on Counter Strike Source egnine tyep like Half life 2 not on this game old but it`s Gold Engine I was get some 40+ games very good for free on these two steam Engines.
280,"Es interesante,sobre todo porque no esta en steam."
281,"basically counter strike story mode

282,Classic game by Valve. Lots of childhood memories. Ahhhhhh
283,muito nice

286,half life but cs
287,"GG
"
288,meh.
289,"A fun single player cs game, strange, but not unwelcome."
290,7/10 cs no friends edition
291,"Old School Counter Strike. Even for the date of release the graphics were....terrible. We had Half Life 2, Halo 2, COD 1 in the same year, and by far, surpassed the graphics in this game. However the old graphics can serve as an advantage,  as even the most potato-y of PC/Laptops can run this no problem. I tried running this on a 15 year old PC with 4 GB of Ram, and about 215 MB of V-Ram, and it ran smoothly. If you can get passed the graphical limitations of the game, then you will find an enjoyable experience. This game serves as the most tactical Counter Strike yet, with a good campaign experience. Outside of graphics, the story and setting is immersive, detailed, and most importantly fun. The unconnected and non-linear story allows for a variety of locations in the world.

I would highly recommend this game for anyone looking for a cheap, simple shooter, that can run on the most crummiest of systems.

Overall rating:
11/13"
292,"the game which brings back the Nostalgia? hell yeah this is great to play CS game with unsettling story mode with decent graphics (at that time) XD, I recommend y'all to play this game :D"
293,Best game of its time
294,"people joke about it but its not horrible, i mean its fairly fun, AI might not be the brightest but its still a decent little campaign."
295,Good Games!!!
296,"i really like this game and y will like it too 
if y like old school counter strike y willl love this 
"
297,Its CounterStrike but with a COD Campaign
298,Boss helicopter. Good old meat.
299,COD but its csgo
300,much good
301,This game is the best shooting game i have ever played. there is never a dull moment. you never know what is next. This game is action packed.
302,"Took plenty of time to complete, very fun, very difficult when you suck at Counter Strike, but a blast from the past, and plenty of secrets, as well as love the showoff in the credits of the technology they were using with physics and etc."
303,"Valve could have easily moved this game to the Source engine, but it is still on the Half-Life engine. Expect low fps, because it is not threaded well, nor it is on DirectX."
304,"The game is very nice and good,i finished it again for fourth time but it is still nice and nostalgically FUN.
Thank's valve for this nice game <3"
305,it kinda fun
306,why yes
307,"The missions are fun to play.It's just counter strike story mode.It's really good,buy it."
308,"All it takes is mouse and keyboard easy.
"
309,nice
310,it brings up the good old memories
311,last resort when me no friends
312,"I FLAT. OUT. LOVE this game. This is one hundred percent Counter Strike: Story Mode, and i think this is the best counter strike game/add-on. I just needed to say that.
"
313,cool deleted scenes and very fun to play
314,its pretty fun to play in your free time. some parts are actually challenging and thats why its enjoyable.
315,bugs

318,My childhood memories what can be better then cs with missions
319,Great counter strike game. The only one that lets you play a campaign. So its great.
320,Low Poly Cod
321,Great enemy A.I. and pathfinding!
322,since no one read review. im a big nerd. pls dont bully :(
323,Mission Accomplished
324,"12 Single Player missions full of action and suspense, all around the world without continuation whatsoever. If you like Counter-Strike, and a bit of a challenge, then this one provides all your needs. I recommend you get this on a sale, like I did and buy it with the whole Counter-Strike Collection."
325,just half life but reskined
326,"It's an ok side gig in the series, people behind CZ definitely were passionate about what they were making, not only renewing the og CS, but also making a single player campaign. Some levels shine through with some interesting ideas and execution, however there are some bugs and jank.

Basically it takes the CS mechanics and all, adds some special equipment, and slaps it onto an half-life like missions. Naturally it doesn't translate super well, recoil, reload times and movement speed are all clearly not the best fit for that kind of game. It is playable of course, and not all that terrible, yet it feels a little off.
It has a handful of very weird things about it, often it's not super clear where you need to go, you sometimes have to sneak around, you get ambushes with rocket launcher guys, sometimes it throws a handful of enemies at you, and each time they hit you, you get the screen turning effect just like normal CS.
I also had a game breaking bug at the weeb level, which is a shame as that one was probably the most interesting, since it was in actual city streets with civilians around.

If you bought the cs pack, it might be worth a shot, keep in mind it's nothing phenomenal, and if you pay attention to the story, you might actually have less fun, seeing how many god damn super special agent infiltrator movie tropes they crammed in (cmon lone wolf, defuse the nuke XDDD). It's quite a basic shooter all in all, but a neat little addition nonetheless."
327,"i like game, please play game"
328,This was just annoying to navitgate without looking up a guide.
329,[h1] Nedrilax approves Counter-Strike: Condition Zero Deleted Scenes. [/h1]
330,Nostalgia
331,"Counte-strike:Modern Warfare

I think it's safe to say that this game is CRIMINALLY underrated."
332,"Has aged really well, had a fun time!"
333,very gud game
334,"An attempt at a  CS single-player campaing, a perfect example that a precision shooter doesn't work in a run and gun game. Why do the terrorists have bullet-proof turbans and bandanas."
335,"[h1]A Single-player mod for Counter-Strike 1.6[/h1]

To be really honest that's what Condition Zero Deleted Scenes is, a Single-player mod. There really isn't anything groundbreaking about this game, but it's fine for what it is. Graphics didn't look good at the time but these days you can consider it as retro. Even if that does sound like a bold statement.

I would recommend this game to anyone that are fans of the Counter Strike series or First Person Shooters."

359,"Believe it or not. This is something quite and interesting to play. It's not much, but it's still great to see a Counter Strike Single Player Campaign Mode. I'm personally happy with this. It's quite fun. Recommend it for sure. It's a good old, but gold game. 5 hours at most and you'll be done with the whole campaign though, it's quite short."
360,"Very fun game from that era, the graphics are ok, it has some story of its own, but it also has a lot of bugs. Basically the game is ok, it's worth the money!

373,"Counter-Strike: Condition Zero Deleted Scenes - to CS z fabułą. Wykonujemy misje jako antyterrorysta a to żeby ochronić ludzi, lub powstrzymać zamach, lub zabić jakiegoś przywódce. Gierka ma 12 misji z czego wychodzi pół godziny na każdą. Akcje odbywają się w różnych częściach świata przez co świat jest odwzorowany tzn: W Ameryce są same duże wysokie drapacze chmur a za to w Japonii ciasne uliczki z mangami na wierzchu. Dostajemy również unikatowe przyrządy jak np: Palnik do rozwalenia zamków lub C4.

380,Its addicting and I don't understand why
381,"Bastante bugeadas algunas misiones. Y como te revientan en difícil, pero bastante divertido. Si lo que buscas es hacer misiones de operaciones especiales pero con la sensación de estar jugando Counter Strike 1.6, este es tu juego."

391,an underrated gem that unfortunately 99% of CS fans have never played
392,"A nice, story-based version of Counter-Strike, Really deserves more attention."

It plays like a generic 00's shooter game. There's no major plot, and every mission has its own little story.
You just play as counter-terrorist, you cannot play as a terrorist."

411,This is actually ass holy fuck
412,"This is essentially a ""Campaign Mode"" for Counter-Strike.
It's a real shame that there isn't anything else like this, but it's still a good game that I found a lot of fun to play, despite the fact it hasn't exactly aged too well in terms of graphics. But that's part of the beauty of games like this: making the most of what you can, while keeping it within the potato-operating systems they had compared to now.

It's clever, well done, and ensures you see plenty of action."

435,"its very good
"
436,I had fun with it
437,"Welp... I'm it's kinda cool to have another Valve (not really) Single-Player game, but at same time it is just Counter-Strike game against bots on scripted kinda cool maps.

I have tried many time to finish this, but it's kinda get boring and I just quit it after mission or two, because there is no challenge in it. Or maybe is just because I prefer to play against people, just like I did for past 20 years lol"

-pros
 call of duty esque campaigntrhwuda
 has cool gadgets
 contains chicken

-cons

453,This is exactly what i was looking for a game where you go through levels with same counter strike style. i love this game.
454,fun as fuk
455,yes
456,"[h1]The only CS game with the Stories[/h1]

so CSCZDS is the one that is described as the CS with several independent stories, but not the original CSCZ. And Valve showed again that they don't fxxked up with the stories. U could get huge amounts of fun, even the sense of playing HL1 but with some independent levels, but some of them is just too short (actually maybe most of them). 
Anyway this game's so fxxking great"
457,meh
458,yes
459,good
460,"I was super annoyed S.W.A.T 4 was not available on steam for a long time, totally missing out on the weirdest mix between it and classic Counter-Strike, that is, the invisible game that goes under everybody'""s radar, Counter-Strike: Zero Deleted Scenes, both mouthful to say and to get through.

If Counter-Strike ever had a more tactical focused game-play, this is what it would have been like, the game-play is slower and more focused on a single-player experience, a lot of new tools and enhancement to the classic textures and weapon sound design, expect from the shotgun, they really dropped the ball on that one. Other than that, it's a mediocre bite-sized linear shoot'em all with a few tactical features that create a weird mix between the classic Counter-Strike experience and the S.W.A.T experience, only chunkier and worst, but still, a quick run down for the buck."
461,Is nice
462,"very good single story but feels like a played already this story... from... call of duty..
but  here.. cs is more older than Cod , so ..... shame activision..."
463,F*CK F*CK F*CK F*CK
464,very good story line! best Condition Zero as its finest!!
465,It really is worth buying when its on sale. The game is more like CoD Modern Warfare than CS. If you play dont put it on hard because it takes a full mag to kill one person.
466,"Really good game but very diffrent from other cs games (NOTE: if you are not the best at csgo or any other cs game, then choose easy, normal is VERY hard)"
467,good game

485,this game sucks
486,"Counter-Strike: Condition Zero (Story Mode) ?
Good!!"
487,this game is soooo hard but its pretty fun
488,you can put a few hours into the game just by playing the normal campaign or have fun with the console commands
489,Actually fun no cap
490,"Top 2 like:
1. It's like CS. But with short single player stories.
2. Voice acting. It's not good, but rather entertaining anyways.

Top 2 dislike:
1. I could not get scoped weapons to work. This includes the door peeky thingy. Seems like the scope sprites didn't work for me. And terrible lag when scoping in until i switch to another weapon.
2. Enemies with lightning reactions."
491,"Pretty fun, I enjoyed playing some of these maps. I found the hangakai map very hard though. I was only given an shield and a fiveseven. Maybe not the best loadout

507,"ITs pretty much the same as every other Valve game. Half Life graphics, half life gameplay, everything. The campaign isn't anything special or complicated, but its still fun to play. There's still the issue of corrupted save files like in every old Valve game ever. I don't know why but Valve really decided to make RPG enemies areal pain in the ass and put them in the most inconvenient spots in the map.

It has issues but I think the game is very fun, 8.5/10."
508,"very fun if you have no internet connection, or just want to pass time"
509,"In this game, you play as ultra-rad dudes, killing ultra-bad dudes, while doing manly-man things, like doing your taxes, visiting your grandparents, and stopping ultra-nationalist terrorist regimes that sell illegal narcotics. It's fantastic."
510,good
511,"i like the whole game, buy it now, while it is on sale"
512,Love counterstrike. but this has major issues with bugs. if its patched i would 100% play again. for now its a broken mess of loading errors and map sync issues.

569,"[b]Intro[/b]
Note: This is a review of the Deleted Scenes campaign only. The content/replayibility score does take in other modes however.

[b]The Great:[/b]
++N/A

[b]The Good:[/b]
+Sound design's actually somewhat decent with some really punchy weapon effects and half-decent environmental effects
+There's something oddly enjoyable about Gold Source's engine despite its annoying quirks. I honestly can't put my finger on it, but I'm sure plenty of people can relate.
+There's some bonus levels outside of the campaign
+The combat isn't totally without its' merits

[b]The Okay/Not Too Big of a Deal:[/b]
+-The devs actually managed to do some impressive things with the engine. Animating dead bodies to look like true ragdoll as in other games for one, and animating crumpling paper and crushing boxes for some more. I don't know how they managed to do some of it on the engine, but it actually does a good job of mimicking
real physics. It absolutely doesn't save this game's presentation, though.
-+The voice acting isn't the worst thing in the world but it's certainly not good, and the phony accents don't help

[b]The Bad:[/b]
-If you're below 25 health, all you can really do is pray to the RNG gods that both the enemy will decide to miss you and that your weapons will be accurate, which aren't often the case. So sometimes you'll go around a corner and die over and over until you get lucky and the enemies decide to miss and your bullets
decide to hit where you're aiming.
-Hit detection is awful, and I know I'm not mistaking it for inaccurate weaponry
-Reload animations are annoyingly long
-Movement is as slippery as Half-Life's, but much slower. Given how many thin ledges and platforming is required from you, I have to wonder who thought giving the character roller-skates was a good idea.
-The campaign is very short. Under 4 hours even on Hard. There are some bonus maps, however.
-Enemy placement is BS sometimes, but especially on the last level
-There is no story. There are settings and objectives for each level, but they're totally self-contained.
-It's barely a challenge for at least half the game, but then the enemy placements get more annoying and it starts kicking your butt some more
-Music's forgettable
-The stealth sections work about as well as you'd expect on this engine. Thankfully, they're rare and cheese-able.

[b]The Horrible:[/b]
--This game came out in 2004... two thousand and fucking four. Yet, it barely looks better than the original Half-Life, which ALREADY looked out of date 6 years ago! To compare this game visually to Half-Life 2, Doom 3, Thief Deadly Shadows, or, you know, ANY game released in 2004, is like comparing the U.S. healthcare
to any other first-world country -- it's nothing but a laughing stock.
--Counter-Strike's trademark nonsensical, ridiculous recoil system made playing this more and more annoying. It's often up to RNG as to whether you'll actually hit anything thanks to random weapon spread mixed with strong recoil. Sometimes you can get two easy headshots without a problem, and sometimes you'll miss
even with your crosshair clearly right on their head and even shots point blank at their body. It's just absurd.
--Incredibly repetitive. Shoot similar types of braindead enemies over and over while planting a bomb or pulling out a gadget every now and then.

Sound: 5.5/10
Graphics: 2/10
Gameplay: 4/10
Content/Replayability: 8/10
Overall: 4.5/10

[b]Conclusion[/b]
Not a dreadful experience, but I can't recommend it. Good for a nostalgia trip if you played this at the time, or just to kill a few hours, but that's about it. I'm sure you have better things to do and games to waste your life on. I don't, that's why I bothered to finish it."
570,i want a better counter strike campaign. this will do. kinda fucked up that they made a mission based on a real terrorist attack in japan. 8/10
571,Good game need to learn old machenics tho if you want to have an enjoyable time'
572,Cool game.  Basically an addition to the famous Counter Strike: Condition Zero game.
573,"NPCs are just pure aimbot, or I suck."
574,"Muy interesante, pocos saben de la existencia de este cs y la verdad no esta nada mal."
575,"Nice souget, very nice gameplay, but the monotony of this game is infuriating!!!"

577,"""HO HO HO HO!""

-Couple of Artic Avengers"
578,amazing better than the toxic multiplayer with more more interesting gameplay than the other games as well
579,really think CS 1.6 is much smoother simpler and enjoyable
580,"This game has a campaign mode, the game itself is decent with mechanics similar to 1.6.
Overall, its decent."
581,Best Counter-Strike game hands down. The only problem I have with it is that you can't change the FOV.
582,ye
583,half the damn time i was stuck
584,this game is great and everyone should give it a try at least once.

586,A VERY fun game that i recommend if you enjoy a good singleplayer fps experience

589,addictive
590,great game
591,good game. classic. you will miss a classic if you do not play
592,"Obligatory vents.
Obligatory physics box.
Obligatory crouching.
Obligatory save scumming into a corner hallway down 87 health.
Obligatory peeking.

Game Saved omg get out of my cross-hairs. 

The Internet goes out, you want this. Packets of ketchup.

I ran out of ammo on about every mission. 

Sometimes enemies can get pretty cheap. Like, you take a step it's so cheap.

I only got through The Alamo because I stayed dead long enough for the ai to sort itself out and after that it went Mission Failure and just queued into Mission Successful and then next mission.

Obligatory ladder.
Obligatory tight-rope ledges.

I couldn't finish Rise Hard, I walked through a double-door and the screen went black.

There's an overview with every mission plotted but there's no indication as to if it's been completed, so after the error I just disconnected. 

I didn't get the AK until the 4hr mark. I thought it was super cool that each mission has its own loud-outs (if you can find them all), I love weapon cycling."
593,Wait this isnt a counter strike movie?
594,The earth is 4.6 billion years old and we managed to exist at the same time as this masterpiece.
595,very nice speech between enemy characters very cool scripted scenes it may get repetitive and cheap sometimes but it makes up for it with the unique missions
596,cool campaign
597,"Counter-Strike: Condition Zero Deleted Scenes is a nice bonus to the original CS:CZ. These deleted scenes actually comprised the single-player campaign that Ritual was working on before game development was handed off to Turtle Rock.
The 12 missions present in this game are pretty fleshed-out, with scripted sequences and dense amounts of action. However, they might feel a bit “clichés” as a whole: they seem like flashbacks to the shooters of 1999 and 2000, so you'll immediately know why Ritual's project was canceled.
None of the missions are linked together so there is no story to it. You are just put in to missions of your choice and given a few basic objectives to complete.
Since I think it is part of the CS pack, there is no reason for you to not try this game."
598,This is really fun why do people dislike this
599,.
600,its good
601,"Ever wonder what a CS story would look like this is pretty much it

story puts you in the shoes of unnamed operators of the famous counter terrorist units such as Seal Team Six SAS GSG 9  Spetsnaz and a fictional one named Japanese Kidotai (well atleast i assume they are fictional) for some reason French GIGN only makes a cameo in the motorcade assault mission 

Gameplay is esentially same as the  counter strike its a on a rails a generic massacare until a specific prompt

best part is game still runs good on laptops even if the battery is no connected thus essentially making it the perfect game to empty battery for a healthier laptop usage"
602,i like guns
603,Much better than most of Call of Duty games :)
604,very nice
605,well I got this game from a bundle and save so i wasen't really expecting much. It was an ok game
606,Yes
607,Same problem with the original but a improvement is bot AI so you can practice by yourself and a singleplayer even though it's not that good.
608,[spoiler]///// ///..[/spoiler]

610,no
611,fun
612,"a shame some of these missions can't easily be ported to sven, they're pretty good"
613,"It's a very good game, except for some inaccuracies (F.E., the global map its bad designed, and some locations are in the middle of the sea when they shouldn't, or some signs translated to Spanish and other languages are awfully written) It's enjoyable, I played it on hard because I wanted a challenge (and it really was), so my experience was dying at least 5 times in every map.
 I rate it 8/10
 Also the credits are f*cking GOLD"
614,89
615,its cool
616,<3
617,Gud Game
618,Yeah.
619,Best expansion to CS!
620,Better than classic Condition Zero
621,"[b]Counter-Strike: Condition Zero Deleted Scenes[/b] is not really talked about and wasn't really popular, but this is a single player game which is actually quite good. This is actually the first time the [b]Counter-Strike[/b] did something like this.

- Single Player campaign
- Great and enjoyable missions
- Some great maps

622,"h1 DELETED SCENE /h1

the campaign is dog shit, bots will flank you from everywhere giving you no chance to kill them without taking damage or they will act brain dead and stand there taking your bullets without reacting. All of the missions are ""generic shot the baddies."" And some of the ""puzzles"" are press button or push a block to make a jump, its ok but the push block if pushed into a corner can softlock your progress forcing you to load a save and repeat the shooting parts (which i fucking hate) or cheat. The worst level is this one japanese mission where the ""puzzle block"" is spawned in the corner FUCKING TWICE IN A ROW. And once i got to the end the fucking ai tried to shoot at me while there was a hostage infront of him basically softlocking the game into a mission fail. in which i just gave up."
623,Yes
624,Well...Counter-Strike:Condition Zero Deleted Scenes
625,ez game
626,the best
627,"This game is a bit overpriced if you buy it individually and its graphics are outdated. I enjoyed playing through the campaign and my overall experience was great. Don't buy this game if you expect it to be a call of duty clone, the mechanics in this game are unique. If you have the money, I suggest you buy the complete Counter-Strike series together."
628,"To start out, I've really got more like five hundred hours in this game. I started playing it obsessively long before Valve thought to add playtime records.

It's fun.

The bots are fairly competent as long as you disallow them from buying grenades and the list of maps that come prepackaged far outstrips that of the original Counter-Strike. (They're also far prettier, at least as much as they can be on the GoldSrc engine). Hostages are, as always, somewhat brain-dead, but they're nowhere near as bad as the ones in Counter-Strike: Source--although the fact they all wear identical orange jumpsuits makes me wonder who really are the good and bad guys. Isn't variety the spice of life?
Sound design and quality are improved slightly from the original game and many of the less generic maps lack that kitchen_rats look that's become so indicative of Half-Life's engine, so that's a plus. At the same time, a lot of maps have odd collision detection issues and I'm somewhat bothered by the fact that Counter-Terrorists are as chatty over the radio as their criminal counterparts.

643,"It may have been bad back then, but oh boy do I have fun playing it in 2020! This game brings something special and unique to the Counter Strike series, and I like it! The missions and fun and engaging, encouraging you to explore your surroundings to find secrets and better weapons. Although the bots are a bit weird at times, the gunplay has been absolutely fine. I'd totally recommend you try this game out!"
644,Good Game
645,Who doesn´t like CS
646,"I think this game is under-appreciated. this game actually added lore to the counter-strike series
I recently finished Miami Heat, and it was great it felt so much unlike the counter strike experience I was used too. Counter-Strike: Global Offensive takes too much of the fame. this game just feels forgotten by time. but this is a good game. 
10/10 could've sworn I heard somethin..."

649,its the samething as condition zero but just worse
650,Ah classic good game.
651,"If you're up for ""single-player"" gameplay with missions certainetly this is for you but if you want PvP avoid it."
652,"[h1]SUMMARY[/h1]
Condition Zero Deleted Scenes is the Call of Duty campaign that you never asked for for Counter-Strike.  It provides a multitude of different situations, environments, and enemies for you to fight in decently scripted scenarios.  The campaign starts off kind of slow and generic in the middle east with Taliban fighters, but quickly ramps things up with more interesting scenarios in South America, city-streets, siberia, and Japan, among others.

It features 18 missions, basic AI, some entertaining action and set-pieces, and has an overall very b-movie appeal.

660,"This game is one of the best games of my childhood along with likes of Project IGI, Half Life, Max Payne etc. Simple FPS no-nonsense shooter with just adequate storyline. Great graphics and game physics for that time. I make sure to play through this game at least once every year."
661,funnier than cscz lmao
662,ok cool game
663,OLD BUT GOLD
664,"This game is actually really great, but horribly underrated.

Historical context: this game was in development for almost 3 years, long overdue and long over-schedule. It was touched by a total 5 different development studios (Rogue Entertainment, Valve, Gearbox, Ritual, Turtle Rock) and had at least 3 distinct development resets. By the time it shipped, CS: Source was right around the corner.

Deleted Scenes is Ritual's singleplayer campaign, which is best described as Counter-Strike meets Half-Life by way of Medal of Honor/Call of Duty. It's a mission-based CS game with scripted, linear levels but it plays pretty well and has great use of scripting to keep the action constantly going.

The only issue is that when Valve modified the game before finally releasing it in March 2004, like altering the mission structure and remove 6 missions from the game. IThey also hid the hardest difficulty setting - it's never exposed. However, the final product is pretty great, an inventive singleplayer approach to Counter-Strike gameplay. Only worth playing on Hard mode or Nightmare mode (skill 0) - but a must-play in that form if you're in any way a CS fan, past or present."
665,yes
666,different maps and every scene is different v/good
667,"[h1] DISCLAIMER: This is a first impressions review, and NOT a full review [/h1]

Counter-Strike: Condition Zero Deleted Scenes is a game developed and published by Valve, and is the sequel to the classic FPS shooter. This version contains deleted scenes that were cut from the original game; Counter-Strike: Condition Zero, hence the title

The game offers some nice graphics, although some ugly glitches here and there, it is pleasant all the same

Counter-Strike: Condition Zero Deleted Scenes overall, however, is a fun game to play, and it does get boring if being played for a long time, but is a very good action game and to play in short bursts

[h1] RECOMMENDED :) [/h1]

[b] A Very Sub-par, Single-player Focused Counter-Strike [/b]

[b] Counter Strike: Condition Zero [/b] sounded somewhat appealing to me on paper - a single-player focused story that could weave a tale within the CS universe. What I encountered instead was a boring, repetitive story mode with predictable mission structure and brainless enemy AI.

The campaign, from what I played, is very disappointing. There doesn't seem to be any coherent plot, so you're just running around doing single-player missions for no reason at all. The diversity of tactics that fuel CS gameplay is so watered down that it frankly doesn't even exist. It plays like a poor version of an original ""Call of Duty"" title, but at least in those games you have some sort of consistent mission and theme. Here, its essentially a mission pack that proves itself to be fairly basic, boring, and asinine.

There is very little character design, and the levels are appear muddy and washed out. There are cliche hostage rescue missions, escort mission, and ""sneak in unnoticed and take everyone out"" type missions. The game is flavorless - it functions, but there is no soul behind it.

The audio is at least pretty good, even despite the other technical limitations. With more polish and work put into this title, it really could have served as a stand-out, smash-hit for Ritual, Turtle Rock, and Valve, but alas it was squandered and remains as a very forgettable CS experience. In the end, I would [b] Not Recommend [/b] playing [b] Counter-Strike: Condition Zero [/b] unless you are a very big CS fan and are desperate for some old-school content.

685,"This is CS 1.6 but in campaign format. The missions are unrelated to each other, but it's still a nice single player campaign with 6 bonus maps to play in which you can enjoy a little bit of the classic counter strike but with the thrill of the unknown.
All missions play well and are unique in their own way, which is a strong plus. You will also see some familiar maps into the mix, another fun plus.
Deleted Scenes is the best of the two Counter-Strike Condition Zero games, and something I truly recommend playing if you own it or you really like CS in general."
686,best cs game ever lots of damn good memories
687,great
688,"This game is more or less Call of Duty singleplayer but it's Counter Strike. The stories aren't very memorable but they are intricate and give you a reason to keep going. The combat is just like Counter Strike except the NPCs don't behave like CS Bots. They behave a little bit like the Grunts from Half Life. Their is a variety of enemies. Snipers, suicide bombers, riflemen, shotgunners, etc. There's even rocket men and machine gunners. The weapons are the best part of the game! We have all of the weapons from previous Counter Strike games but we also have a few new additions! We have a rocket launcher, a machine gun that is based off of the M60, and we also have some tools for certain missions like a blowtorch, radio controlled bombs, a fiber optic camera, a walkie talkie, a regular camera, and a briefcase. I'm only into the second mission so I don't know exactly what everything does, but kind of get the idea on what everything is supposed to do. There's only 12 levels but holy crap there difficult, and this is probably the only flaw with CSCZ:DS is that I'm always low on ammo, and considering that the only weapon that doesn't consume ammo is the knife, it's gonna get ridiculous if you keep missing you're shots. The enemies can be annoying sometimes to, some die in a few hits, others take like three shotgun gun shells to the chest! The damage is inconsistent and can get really annoying if you're close to death. Speaking of death, if you die without saving, there's a change you might have to restart the whole mission. There IS autosaves but they only happen occasionally. Overall a really underrated Counter Strike game."
689,"It's like Call of Duty, before Call of Duty. Very much an outdated, but charming, experience. Besides the Half-Life Engine's old clunkiness, the worst thing is the enemy AI and their inability to move around. The missions are enjoyable and it shows you a pretty cool view into the past of Counter-Strike's development history."

691,"This game is really, really good in my opinion. It's a lot like a much more intense, tactical and way harder half-life, I just completed the entire campaign in about 7 hours so it's not a super long game but definitely one worth playing. If there is one gripe I have it's that there is a huge and sudden difficult spike on the last two or so missions."
692,It's pretty good but I like the other Condition Zero much more.
693,Bring backs so many memories! I liked the campaign a lot and it would have been nice if they made this for the other CS games too.

No matter how old it gets will always put a smile on your face whenever you will play it and in the end that all matters!!"
715,Story Based Counter Strike
716,"So first things first. I never knew this game was single player... 20 years and i never knew it! I only gound out from a Noclip documentary that this was single player.... Why am i only finding this out now! Back in the days before internet i was a weedy 10 year old with a disc with half life mods and expansions that included this and all i used it for was adding the cool weapons to half life and its expansions and now you tell me it had its own missions and isnt a multiplayer game! This game is awesome! Yeah sure people are going to crack up that counter strike should always be PVP but i actually like to think of this as a prequel to half life. I have my reasons.... Sure the first mission threw me for a loop when my ""delta"" guy kept running in to get killed in 5 seconds flat but ya know what i worked around it and the rest of the game is fun challenging and this may be lockdown fever talking but i think it is a really good game. Why have i never heard of this before! I see elements that would later become splinter cell in here.. Elements that would later become call of duty modern warfare - the old one not the new one... why did they call it the same thing twice. Anyway this was out before all those wasn't it?"

[b]ตัวเกมภาพรวม[/b]
 [list]
      [*]ยังพูดไปข้างต้นภาคนี้เป็นการเล่นโหมด Single player และเราจะโลดแล่นไปกับภารกิจต่างๆใน Counter-Strike ซึ่งก็อย่างที่เรารู้กันว่าจะมีอยู่ 3 อย่างคือ การกำจัดผู้ก่อการร้าย กอบกู้ระเบิด และการช่วยเหลือตัวประกัน ถึงแม้ว่าจะมีเพียงแค่  3 อย่างนี้ แต่ เนื้อเรื่อง ลูกเล่นต่างๆในเกมทำให้เราไม่เบื่อกับเกมเลยแม้แต่น้อย 
      [*]ภาคนี้ไม่ใช่ Counter-Strike ธรรมดาทั่วไปมันถือว่าเป็นลูกของ Half-Life ที่มีเชื้อของ Half-Life มากที่สุดเลย(ก็มันมีการดำเนินเรื่องอ่ะเนอะ ถ้าภาคนี้จะไม่ใช่ก็ยังไงอยู่) และน่าจะแปลกกว่า เพื่อนๆ First-Person shooting ด้วยเพราะในด่านแต่ละด่านบางทีการดำเนินไปข้างหน้าจะไม่เป็นแค่การเดินผ่านประตูหรือการ Take cover แต่มันจะมีการปีนป่ายหาทางในการเดินต่อไปหรือทางที่มันลับตามากถึงมากที่สุดแต่นั่นแหละคือทางไปต่อซึ่งบางทีมันอาจจะดูขัดหลักอยู่กับเกม First-person shooting ทั่วไป แต่พอมาคิดดูแล้วว่า 
Counter-Strike เป็นลูกของ Half-Life แล้วผมไม่แปลกใจกับการสร้างด่านแบบนี้เลย แต่ไม่เพียงแค่การไปต่อบางทีถ้าเราตาดีเราก็อาจจะได้ปืนที่จะทำให้เราผ่านด่านง่ายขึ้น ก็ต้องมีปีนหน้าต่างปีนคานบ้านกันไปบ้าง การฮีลรักษาก็เหมือนกับ Half-Life คือมีตู้พยาบาลสำหรับการฮีลประจำจุดถ้าแถวนั้นไม่มีก็ต้องลากสังขารให้ถึงจุดต่อไปให้ได้ ซึ่งพอเเมื่อถึงกล่องประจำจุดก็จะมีศัตรูที่อยู่รายล้อมหรือว่าแอบลอบยิงสำหรับผู้ที่ไม่รอบคอบมุ่งหน้าแต่จะเอากล่องพยาบาลอย่างเดียวให้ต้องกำหมัดและตายอย่างน่าอนาทไปและส่วนใหญ่ศัตรูจะไม่วิ่งมาหาเรามันจะให้เราวิ่งไปหาและรุมฆ่าเราอย่างเลือดเย็น
      [*]จากข้อก่อนหน้าเราพูดถึงสไตล์ของศัตรูในภาคนี้ไปบ้างแล้ว อาจจะไม่ถล่มมาหาเราก็จริงแต่มันจะอยู่ประจำแทบทุกจุดแทบทุกหัวมุมที่เราผ่าน ซึ่งศัตรูแทบจะได้เปรียบเราเสมอเมื่อเราเดินผ่านเจอหน้าปุ๊ปมันจะยิงเราเลย ในแทบจะทันทีหรือด่านจะมีสไตล์ที่ให้เราเดินไปในทางแคบแล้วทางออกเป็นพื้นที่โล่งมากซึ่งจะมีศัตรูเล็งมาที่เราในทุกสารทิศ ไม่ว่าจะเป็น สไนเปอร์ หน่วยปืนLMG และอาวุธครบมืออีกมากมาย แต่สิ่งที่พีคที่สุดในเกมนี้คือ ตัวถือ rocket launcher มันไม่ลังเลและพร้อมจะยิงเสมอไม่ว่าคุณจะพร้อมหรือไม่พร้อม ไม่ว่าจะเป็นพื้นที่แคบหรือพื้นที่กว้างมันยิงเรียบ มันอาจจะบื้อตรงที่สามารถยืนอยู่เฉยๆ แล้วเรามีเหลี่ยมในการยิงได้ แต่เราจะไม่ถือว่ามันเป็นการอ่อนให้ ต้องเรียกว่าเกมเมตตาให้เรามากกว่าเพราะมันไม่ได้ทำให้ง่ายลงซักเท่าไหร่เลย
      [*]สิ่งที่เพิ่มเติมมาในนี้คืออุปกรณ์ 3 อย่าง(3 อย่างนี้จะเป็นหลักส่วนใหญ่จะอยู่เกือบทุกด่านซึ่งอุปกรณ์อีกหลายอย่างก็มีแต่มันอยู่แค่เฉพาะด่านนั้นๆ) ซึ่งมี Blowtorch[spoiler]อุปกรณ์สำหรับพังล็อคประตู[/spoiler]Fiber Optic Camera[spoiler]อุปกรณ์สำหรับสอดส่องศัตรูด้วยกล้องขนาดเล็กซึ่งจะส่องผ่านมุมผ่านช่องต่างๆ[/spoiler]และ Radio Controlled Bomb[spoiler]อุปกรณ์สำหรับการระเบิดของหรือเพื่อเปิดทาง[/spoiler] ซึ่งมันก็ใช้ได้แค่เฉพาะที่มันต้องการให้ใช้แหละ มันก็ทำให้อะไรๆสมจริงมากขึ้น ทำให้การลอบเร้นในเกมนี้สนุกขึ้น
       [*]ในนี้จะมีกองกำลังตำรวจ(ไม่เชิงตำรวจ)นั้นก็คือ Kidō-tai คือหน่วยปราบจลาจลในญี่ปุ่นซึ่งไม่มีปรากฎในภาคไหนๆให้ได้เล่นกันด้วย(ในวิกิจะเรียกว่า Riot Police Units)     
[b]สรุป[/b] เกมนี้อาจจะเก่ามากแล้วหรืออาจจะไม่มีเนื้อเรื่องเข้มข้นเหมือน Half-Life พ่อของเจ้าหนูคนนี้ แต่ต้องบอกว่าเขาได้จากพ่อแรงมากถ้าต้องการหาเกมที่ใช้เวลาไม่มากและเป็นกลิ่นอายของ Half-Life เกมนี้ค่อนข้างตอบโจทย์สำหรับคุณเลย [spoiler]แค่ระดับปานกลางผมก็ตายบ่อยแล้วอ่ะ Hard น่าจะเร้าใจน่าดู[/spoiler] นี้คืออีกมุมอีกด้านหนึ่งในหน้าประวัติศาสตร์ Counter-Strike ที่คุณไม่ควรจะมองข้ามเลย ขอให้มีความสุขกับการเล่นเกมนะฮะ ⊙▽⊙"
718,"Released less than a year before Valve introduced the world to the Source engine with the release of Half-Life 2, Counter-Strike: Condition Zero Deleted Scenes is something of a swan song to the GoldSrc engine that powered the first Half-Life game and its derivative mods/campaigns.

If Half-Life offered gamers the first cinematic FPS experience in history, CS:CZ DS is something like the first half-hour action anthology television series FPS. Across 18 unconnected single-player episodes, players take on the role of various counter-terrorist agencies across the globe and complete mission objectives including hostage rescue, sabotage, and killing every terrorist in sight. The graphics, animation, and voice acting are all great for their time and offer a fine dose of nostalgia for older gamers.

Those who have played any of the mainline Counter-Strike games will find few similarities in CS:CZ DS's gameplay (aside from some cosmetic and thematic similarities). The team coordination and tense showdowns of CS have been replaced by standard single-player FPS mechanics, and the level design is highly (perhaps excessively) linear.

Still, CS:CZ DS is very much worth playing. The gameplay is varied and exciting, the scripted events are spectacular (in the Half-Life mold), and the overall production values are exactly what you would expect from Valve."

I like the simple way it is, doesnt need to be fancy. Shooting up terrorists, saving hostages on an international stage. Would have been nice to see this go further with more in these days, but at least we have these missions. Would recommend to all hard core fans who want to play soldier and real life operations based gameplay. Still playing it sometimes when im bored or after a good war movie , just to keep the heart pumping haha."
740,"Pretty good, Not gonna lie! I really like how all this AI's has such a silly death animations, Now i have seen everything."
741,Good products for collectible sake for Counter-Strike franchise fans. A complete package from Condition Zero series.
742,"Counter-Strike Condition Zero: Deleted Scenes is a breath of fresh air to play, even now. A classic game, it can be easily mistaken as one of those games that fill your library but goes untouched, which is a big mistake. This game was mostly overlooked during the time of its release and neglected as nobody was ready for a Counter-Strike ""story mode"" game. And who can blame the playerbase, at a time when a multiplayer Counter-Strike was at the height of its popularity with the rise of ESports and thousands of dollars in tournaments. But, like many movies that flop and turn into cult classic later in their time, Condition Zero deleted scenes by Ritual Entertainment is an amazing change, it's like playing Half-life but with Counter-Strike flowing through it, like some strange lovechild of the two franchises. I would argue this game is the original Call of Duty, offering the same thing from an equally huge blockbuster title. I would definitely recommend this game if you like CS 1.6 as it brings the original Counter-Strike into story mode form with thrilling fast paced 80s action style missions."

749,УУУУУУУУУУ
750,"For what it is, I think it's a great little game to grind out on a rainy weekend when you have nothing else to do. 

The storyline of the game isn't really the most engaging or interesting, it's kind of your standard 'Here's a set of missions leading up to this big momentous event that you need to carry out.' I won't spoil it, but I would personally go into the game to see the progress of CS, the FPS genre and Valve in general. One thing I will say, is that the level design for the game is quite impressive for the time. The immersion of the game is something that I really enjoyed. Some levels make you feel like you're in Saving Private Ryan, others like you're in Indiana Jones, and others like building scene towards the end from The Matrix. The missions that you have to play suit different playstyles quite well too. If you're someone who goes in all-guns-blazing like Rambo, you can do that, but you'll have to rely on your aim and reaction times being quite good. You can play it slow too, peeking corners carefully, and clearing out rooms as though you were destined for a SWAT team. Or if utility is more your thing, then you can take advantage of smokes, flashes, molotovs, and grenades too. As well, some levels have a puzzle-like element to them, where you have to find a way to progress through the stage, whether that's looking for a vent that you have to crawl through, finding a ladder disguised as a pipe, or a specific item that helps you blast open a door. I will admit (shamefully) there were some times where I did have to look at a walkthrough, but I'm a little impatient, and had I spent an extra 5 minutes, I probably would've been fine. Gameplay is identical to that of CS:CZ, with graphics and performance being the same.

No, it's not the best game that Valve has ever made, but I would take the game as more of a learning experience. A product of its time. Yes, the graphics look VERY dated compared to today, and the level design doesn't compare to what we have now, but you have see the game from the eyes of someone from 2004, and you will see a glimpse of appreciation for where we are today. Give the game a try, don't take it too seriously, have fun."

754,"[h1] CS: Condition Zero Deleted Scenes Review [/h1]

CSCZ: DS is probably the only story-based entry in the entirety of the Counter-Strike games, and the singleplayer manages to actually be fairly good. Running on the GoldSrc engine of Half-Life and Counter-Strike 1.6, the game has a bunch of story-oriented missions where you can go around killing terrorists and rescuing hostages in many locations. 

The training area is surprisingly well made also, but I feel that there were a few areas that were a bit buggy at times, and that might just be because it's on a 1997/98 game engine of all things. 

CSCZ DS also has little health/medical cabinets to replace the health chargers that you could find throughout HL1 (if you've played that), and suit charge is replaced with basic ballistic armour. 

The gunplay is pretty good in most of the levels (at least the ones that I have played for myself), but there are a few places where it gets a bit annoying, especially if you lack the appropriate equipment (in one level, I think it was Alamo, there can be a terrorist who continuously throws grenades down the stairs). The melee is also pretty mediocre, especially since this is, once again, a GoldSrc game. That makes the melee more like this: Hit, get to cover, hit, get to cover, repeat until enemy is dead.

Overall, I recommend it if you want a Counter-Strike story mode. It's obviously not up to the graphics or physics standards of CS:GO or CSS, but it mostly makes up for it in the gameplay department."

780,"At least it works on Win 10, which shows what a great engine Half-life was using.

But to play it is simple a waste of time now.

Some levels stacking or too vague how to proceed"
781,pretty good
782,You shud play it. :D
783,"Well it's quite odd a Single-player Counter-Strike game, but if I am honest this was fun for me at least.

There is little story though, only missions (like hostage rescue, infiltration, assassination, etc).

The music is decent it fits the theme.

The visuals are what you expect from a Gold source 1 game.

But overall I give this a 7/10"
784,"Well. This was a thing, I guess. It's like a semi-serious community made mod, but with an official contract with Valve. If you have nothing better to do, and your PC is at least a level 3 toaster, you should be able to enjoy this, but keep in mind, that when you don't need it, there will be tons of ammo and health, but when you desperately need them, they seem to have vanished,

This game is an unfinished unbalanced mess. The end credits really sum up the experience."
785,eh old game but good for a one go
786,It remembers me of classic COD
787,Very underrated
788,"Greatest Counter-Strike game!
Comes with fun gameplay,great story,and level design!
Pros:
Fun for hours
good level design
Cons:
Some bugs"
789,as i said about classic CZ mode - this story mode simple but hardcore and interesting. and im not sick guy. its fascinating and fun.
790,mega manqk sum na serjanta lubimec
791,"Not as good of the original 1.6. But, it did something to fixed everything, before the latest release of the Source replaced everything."
792,Is ok
793,Even though it was discontinued its actually better than you would think and its a ton of fun
794,good game
795,a classic in single player
796,"Nice little valve game. Before I bought it, I didn't even know, that CS with a plot singleplayer exists."
797,"Despite its flaws and being incomplete (as I've discovered these days), I still had some fun with this game, and I loved it when I was younger. The A.I is dumb sometimes, but the missions are nice, the maps are beautiful, and each mission is short, so it won't take too much time."
798,★ ★ ★ ★ ★
799,very epic yes
800,GREAT GAME
801,"amazing
"
802,ffuytyyufrtfgyftrtsdygsdfgsdhfsdfr sghs
803,i love missions that is done in here i hope in new counter strike games will be same kind missions like here or remastered
804,"Entire game I had a feeling of being set up, squad constantly was either dying at the beginning of the mission or coming up with excuses why not to do the mission with me."
805,"The thing which makes this Counter-Strike different than the other ones is that this one has story mode. I always enjoyed games with story modes, story lines etc. CS: CZ Deleted Scenes is definitely for me and everyone who likes these type of games."
806,<3
807,jd123
808,cs 1.6 but with a singleplayer campain
809,Yes.
810,Coolest counter strike campaign. This game didnt get the attention it needed at the time. Even now.
811,After all this years this game is still a classic and a must have to remember how FPS used to be in the early days.
812,nostalgia
813,EXCELENTE <3
814,very fun call of duty like campaign with counter strikes amazing gun play and the great half life like levels and gameplay but it seems to much half life like but its a solid 8.9/10 for me but im biased because i love csgo and half life and its like they meet.
815,"it's okay i guess
7/10 would guerrilla warfare again"
816,"I love this game so much.

But I am looking forward for a sequel or spiritual successor and something that is rather much more realistic and with some stealth mechanics."
817,"This game is great, it's counter-strike but with missions."
818,Counter Strike but with a singleplayer campaign
819,"E destul de fain, atata am de zis, joc bun pentru 81 de centi..."
820,"really good
"
821,"It lost my save.

Other than that, the game is decent, basically a Call of Duty with extremely confined space and CS gun mechanics, but still enough to be a fun game."
822,The missions are fun. Kind of scary though because you don't know where the enemies are.
823,"Это дополнение, которое включает сюжетную компанию. И это выглядит интересно. Поиграть в Counter-Strike в компанию, это свежно. Сами миссии здесь в меру сложные и в меру интересные. То-есть ничего удивительного вы не увидите и впринципе компания не вызовет у вас  каких то положительных и ярких эмоций. 

Итог: интересная задумка, но проходняк."
824,NPCs are stupid but nice bossfights lmao
825,It's cool if you like playing old games !
826,"Never thought an actual fun Counter Strike game could ever exist; a decent gallery of missions that's better than Overwatch 2, the guns actually work and most things felt optimised, despite it's age. And yet all we got is CSGO trying to mimic Fortshite, this was indeed a suprise.

For reasons beyond me, all of this content was cut and dropped despite having a ton of potential of making Counter Strike an approachable game, the campaign may have felt repetitive at times, but I liked how it tried to do a lot of things and do them well.  

It's a shame to see all of this content go to waste. To some Counter Strike purists, this time capsule of a game may have came across as your generic Call of Duty first person shooter, but honestly I think it's the only Counter Strike game it had fun to be found in.

7/10"
827,ho lee sit download
828,Stamp of Approval!
829,"yeah its a game
its single player counter-strike
idk what else you expected"
830,"A fun experience, similar to Half-Life."
831,Its better than Operation Shattered Web.
832,gud gayme
833,good cut content
834,kakkasin housuuni
835,"Its as good as those typical Call of Duty campaigns. (so not very good) 
The levels are Half Life 1 type of confusing. 

Yet its still counter strike, and it comes free if you buy the Normal Cs cz"
836,"shuut gaem, very gud"
837,A neat spin-off to the greatest game of all time where you can play some old school missions if you ever get bored of public servers and clan wars
838,a sp cs campaign. whats not to like
839,you should buy this game full price it is so good ! ! ! ! !!  ! 50000000/10 best game i have ever played
840,Old Sounds of Half-Life Episode 2. Very Good
841,the mission mood is so cool :)
842,yes
843,Deleted Scenes from Counter-Strike : Condition Zero
844,"A pretty enjoyable story campaign playing the role of the counter terrorists.

Pros:
*Enjoyable but brief music
*Nice looking environments
*Causing Destruction and pacing went well together.
*Fun dialogue
*The stealth action parts were good

Cons:
*Easy to get lost at some points, but nothing major
*Hidden enemies that don't have any telegraph of being there (Moving around, making sound, etc)
*Ammo was somewhat scarce for a game with alot of enemies at some points. Bit easy to run out even with placing shots well."
845,"Banger.
Enjoyed all 16 minutes of my playtime."
846,Light side of this game is story mode which is fun to play!
847,Great variety and nice self contained stories. Can be punishing with bosses however so be prepared for some difficult fights. World map doesnt look right in widescreen but still works.
848,noice
849,t f
850,Kind of weird when CS has a campaign but it's as good as COD.
851,epci
852,Good
853,This game had no counter strikes and there were conditions being made and there were no deleted scenes
854,this game is my favorite agong all of game. This made my childhod better!!!
855,CS 1.6 is better. Idk how a newer version of a game feels less realistic...
856,"Como esperando de um jogo antigo, contendo ideias de um novo."
857,This game has a very good campaign. The only problem is that the enemy spawn is very bad
858,It is teh classsix
859,This is a good game if you like cs games.But if you dont i dont recommend this.I like the game is your opinion if you want to buy this game.
860,Didn't age well.
861,just fun
862,Deleted Scenes is the singleplayer campaign version of Counterstrike.
863,Best Singleplayer campaign.
864,its fun
865,Basically a horror CS 1.6 with so many campaigns. This game will punish you hard for not checking every corner. Might also rage quit.
866,Great CS atmosphere in Single Player maps.
867,bbbbaaasically counterstrikecampaign!!!! u get to kil lterroist with gun and its like wtf
868,vary fun
869,"funny voice lines, sometimes frustrating missions. Graphics is bad but game is very unique from other Counter Strike Games"
870,its not very challeging and i wouldnt say its good. but it feeds my hunger for nostalgia.
871,Gg
872,이게임은 갓겜이라서 언제든 심심하면 한번쯤해볼만하고 한번해보면 빠져나올수 없는 무한한 재미를가지고있어요 모두 재미있게 하시길 바래용
873,"When I was told to buy Counter Strike: Global Offensive, I decided to buy the Counter Strike collection because it was a Steam sale. It came with Condition Zero, Deleted Scenes reminded me alot of the original Half-Life obviously because Counter Strike is a mod for Half Life. 7 hours of campaign fighting terrorism across the globe. Anybody who likes Goldsrc counter strike if they don't mind playing a  campaign instead of multiplayer, half life players because this is obviously similar should play Deleted Scenes as well."
874,cs the story
875,good for its age
876,nice to play
877,"i love this game, this game is life"
878,its good and but when i enter it its opens up is cs 1.6 so if you know what to do tell me
879,good
880,AIJSOIJSOJSOOISJOISJJIJSOIJSOIJSJOIJSOJSOJSOJOSJS
881,no
882,better than global offensive
883,cs
884,"This game was Valve's take on a Single player CS game. I must say, they pulled it off in Style. 

The game gives me delta force mixed vibes, absolutely beautiful given from its time era. 

hopefully we get a single player for CSGO one day?"
885,Its fun
886,nice
887,It's not that bad l just think it should be fixed or mods should fix it or that's a thing l don't know l have a small pp anyway
888,"I don't know. It's just fun. If this was updated into CS:GO, i can see this being a huge hit."
889,"Old but gold, I still play it"
890,It was fun
891,Single player Counter Strike. Great game!
892,is fun
893,very  good game
894,"Welcome to a new episode of ""Valve trying to convert a story game mod back into a story game"""
