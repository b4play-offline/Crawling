1,guess its just one game that is like an addiction to the point of loosing the track of time it self!
2,Game
3,Addicting as heck at times.
4,"Best strategy game ever, more refined than civ vi and more chill"
5,"My best friend got me hooked on this game back in high school. This is a good time killer game and how when you make a turn based game could be fun. I like how you have to go into the game thinking as well as needing to plan out your moves ahead of time, and make sure that you are going to make the right choice in that turn. With all that said I would recommend this game good to kill time and all around fun if you like convective thinking games."
6,"No one is going to read this, so i am gay.
"
7,I used to love this game but it will not start on steam now. Steam has been useless in helping.
8,sid civiled izsations
9,"“This game is better than Civilization V with the Brave New World expansion.”

Thank you Law and Order SVU"
10,A fun strategy game with history added to it based on the different civilizations. Can take a long time to get through one game but easy to save at anytime and get back too. Turn Based strategy. Fun to play.
11,yeah its alright
12,Great turn by turn game - has the feel of a living board game. Learn about history and get cultured while playing a game!
13,"One of the greatest games i've ever played, irreparably tarnished by a buggy and unnecessary 'launcher' recently forced into an update.

shit. 0/10."
14,"Added a new online launcher I assume to bundle with more transactional garbage. 
It is currently in beta and crashing.

I have had no issues running this game till the new launcher was added. 

2k getting greedy."
15,Rip to sleep
16,"Would I recommend this game to a friend? No, because I don't want them to become addicted like I still am."
17,Experience pain and suffering
18,"this is a wonderful version of Civ
it truly brings the best of Civ to game play"
19,"Have to watch the time, but a great experience, from passive through to warfare, you can try them all and see the world thrive."
20,e
21,one of the best strategy games ever
22,Perhaps the most comfortably lazy version of CIV.
23,Legalize nuclear bombs.
24,"Enjoy the flow and originality of each game.  Wish it would progress into advanced weapons like Civ IV did.  Liked so much better than Civ six, which I no stopped playing to go back to V"
25,This bussin no cap
26,their should be more leaders
27,"its good.

30,Honestly it is a fun game to play with your friends to establish dominance about who has the superior world leaders. Long games though so make sure that be ready to spend at least 5 hours per games.
31,yup it's good now stop asking me to review this game
32,yes
33,it's ok
34,"This game rocks

44,"Thanks Sid, very cool."
45,u click on this and u just win lol if you have to be smart lik me to win tho u will prolly be bad
46,i have an addiction now
47,My bestie's favorite game. He always down and committed to play every Sunday.
48,"Just a heads up, MAC USERS CAN ONLY PLAY WITH OTHER MAC USERS, THERE IS NO LONGER CROSSPLAY.
"
49,Every time you play the game you can choose to play it differently. Almost a game that you can change the ending of any time you play. Always learning different techniques. Keeps it interesting.
50,Great game
51,l
52,Civ games are the primary source of most of my general world knowledge.  They make learning fun!
53,"poland is too strong but thats exactly what they wanted

dont play this without the dlc"
54,"I have been playing Civilization ever since it was a very poor table game, but the sales of those games earned the author enough money to build Civilization I. Each following release has been better than the last. I have succeeded in wining at every version, including 5, but now that 6 is out it is a whole new ball game, I've played it 3,000 hours and not to complete one full game yet."
55,Its Fun
56,Pain to learn but worth it
57,Just finished my first map. It's pretty good.
58,perfection
59,"It is kinda hard but that's the beauty of it it gives you kinda a challenge and i love the strategy of planing your strikes against enemy npc players i love this game and i think its a great game for passing the time and just make your own empire or nation that you have always wanted but everyone has a different view point on this subject so in the end its your choice to buy it or not, but i do recommend that you try the game first"
60,"Civilization is a fantastic strategy game.  There are many intricacies to the game and resources to manage.
The best part of all it's a turn-based game which means nothing happens for other players until you click the continue button."
61,goes alright. im no genius.
62,goooooooooooooooooooood
63,For a certain kind of player this classic game is one of the best choices.
64,Good Game
65,"This game has endless hours of fun, although the course of the game and the path to winning can get a bit boring at times. Playing as each ruler though is enough to satisfy my desire for something a little different, and after 500 hours I can still say I love playing this game on a lazy day off, letting 8 hours fly by like it's nothing."
66,I prefer Civ 4. This game has a few new ideas but feels flat. Civ 6 refines those ideas but I think 4 is really a better experience.
67,great fucking game
68,my favorite game of all time- Civ6 is a pile of piss next to this masterpiece
69,yes
70,Old but good
71,"This game is better then CIV 6.      

So i will say the following i RECOMMEND the game.

The bad
- This is a New type of civ.   Civ 2 3 and 4 is a different game style compared to this.   And no i don't mean hexagons.
- Happiness is very annoying.
-  One  military unit per title.....
- Warmongering is nuts.
- the computer loves Peace over war... To extreme extent.  Warmongers will have it too easy.

The good.
-its CIV.... you should know its good.
- Hey hexagons!
- Strategy in war is more interesting then older civs.
- Game is very replayable.
- MODS...

Overall
Civ5  is basicly a great game that civ 6 followed in.   However civ 5 and civ6 started the DLC practice.    Civ 6 is a Horrible offender of this.     While civ 5 is not as bad it has enough to annoy you.    Enjoy CIv boys all the good civs are already out.  Civ7 and on will most likely only be money holes.    The value is here and before this game."
72,Civ 4 was better
73,Winning feels the best in this game 10/10
74,Best civ. Best graphics and best characters. community content is also dope.
75,"Ahhhhhh...watching videos, reading reviews..sobbing. This game is purely golden. I miss it. VI can gfis. I'm coming home, sweetheart! ~Civ V Rec 10/10"

82,"So, I read all the reviews about losing time before I started playing. 

This is my first time with a civilization game, but I got it on sale with all the DLC so I thought, what the hell.

At first, I didn't get it. I did not at all understand how this game entrances people to the point that they lose time.

I get it now. Once I got the hang of it, all I want to do is play this game. I literally told my husband to hide my laptop so that I can focus on real life, and not this game. I'm still thinking about it though....."
83,Better than Civ VI
84,Game sucks.
85,"Really? 2K games added a POS launcher to several of its games on Steam, including this one? Yeah screw that noise."
86,This is a good game. You can play it solo against bots or online with friends. You can play really long games or shorter ones.
87,The yes should be enough to convince you.
88,"It's Civilization, it doesn't need a review. They're all good. Except that crap ported to mobile."
89,The Random Map Options are great and having several level so it is challenging for several plays
90,I still love this game. I'm not fond of Civ6 though. Why they adapted such a childish look I have no idea...
91,"If you ever need to stop playing this game, make sure you stop playing just before you hit the ""end turn"" button, it doesn't happen if you press it."
92,I keep coming back to this game because it’s just perfect. 10/10
93,"Great game, better than CIV 6 depending on what type of victory you are looking to complete."
94,I LOVE THIS GAME. VERY SATISFIED!
95,"civ is the basis for most tech and time games.
why play a one off when you can play the original"
96,Good.
97,good game
98,Best Civilization sim bias opinion. give it a shot with advanced ui it doesnt feel old.
99,Waste of time
100,does not work just closes back
101,Great game. THE turn based game to play.
102,Fell in love with series because of this game
103,"Okay, it's a great game, one of the best in it's genre. 
Why the negative review? 
Because of the ""Retire"" button. 
I thought it was something akin to the Mount&Blade retire option, where you get an epilogue based on your wealth, influence and performance. Wrong, it's a game over button, only worse. Much worse.
I expected the game to end, so I saved before clicking it, which was a smart thing to do because it's an auto-lose button, no prompts asking you are you sure or anything. You click it, you lose. ""Well, that's why you saved, right? You can just reload and continue, right?"" Wrong. The game misleads you by giving you the options to quit game and continue game at the lose screen, I thought to myself nice, I don't have to reload game. Wrong.
See, the game continues normally for the most part, except for the end - it disables victory conditions.
I was going after the spaceship victory but couldn't assemble it, after a short search on the net I discover that if you press ""Retire"" you do indeed lose the game permanently. A bunch of people had this ""bug"" where the ""assemble spaceship"" button doesn't work and I was confused as hell until I read someones comment asking if you pressed the retire button, it should be grayed out and it means you already lost the game. 

So a recap: 
The game has a ""Surrender"" button that misleads you by calling itself ""Retire"", not only does it not ask you are you sure, but if you accidentally misclick (it's right next to the ""Options"" button) on it you have automatically lost the game, and it will even take a step further by misleading you with the option to continue, only to tell you at the end ""No-no, you can't win, you already lost"" after you invested 10+ hours into it. And the great thing is even if you are aware of this due to having no prompt to ask you if you misclick on it you have to reload the game and if you haven't saved before, that's it. You lost. Permanently.
Doesn't matter how great your armies, how many victories you achieved.
No matter how smart and educated your population is, they will never see the stars.
Your civilisation? Your culture? Irrelevant specs of dust, you already gave up, remember?

I'm probably overreacting a little (or a lot) but having the ending soured like this left me feeling really dissatisfied (tried cultural and diplomatic victory too, I fulfilled what I needed but seems all victory triggers are disabled). Playing a lengthy game with a buddy can be fun and all but if he flips the table and starts screeching ""REEEEEEE you lost REEEEEEEE I don't care about the end REEEEEEEEEEE you never won"" it will just spoil the whole experience and because of some arbitrary crap.
Why even add a button that does nothing but disable victory conditions? There already is a quit game button and it works fine. Asks you are you sure, doesn't break the game, even asks you if you are sure. Was it that hard to implement? Actually no, was it that hard NOT to implement it? 
I guess I should be grateful they didn't put the ""Retire"" button between ""Save"" and ""Options"" so it's easier to misclick. 
"
104,adictive fun in any civ game
105,Its a fun strategy game. I was a little confused at first but when I started to understand It became really fun. It keeps your attention and doesn't get boring.
106,Epic! Build a space ship or sell your jeans to the world!
107,"There are more advanced games from this producer but I first encountered this one and so still like the play as opposed to the more modern and advanced versions. (Old School mentality, I guess! lol)
"
108,"Long term engaging across many different people types

"
109,"10/10
"
110,"Still better than it's mobile-tier graphics sequel, despite having less features"
111,"Get it on some sale with all expansions, install free Vox Populi set of mods, and got best Civilization in the series and probably one of the best strategic games ever  :)"
112,"An enjoyable turn based strategy game, can keep you entertained for many hours."
113,"hmm good
"
114,"2k thought it was a good idea to add their buggy 2k launcher DRM to their games that have been out for over a decade, and the launcher breaks these games for Linux users.
I wish Steam would allow me to refund this game because I did not agree to having this 2k account DRM garbage installed with these games when I bought them. But since they wont allow me, I will write this review saying that I will never buy another Take-Two product ever again. I'm sick of companies like Take-Two, their sub-divisions, and their anti-consumer practices."
115,Fun as fuck to play in class
116,I really feel like the 345 hours I have on this game says more than any actual description I could give.
117,good
118,Better than civ 6
119,All good
120,Great game. You'll love it!
121,very gud
122,good memories
123,fun and encompassing
124,"Great game, reminds me of the classic Civilization games. Probably one of my favorite of the entire series."
125,It is a fun strategy game. Graphics are good.
126,"The last of the decent Civ games. 

Civ 6 was the worst purchase ever. Just stick with 5! I have played 1 - 5 and enjoyed them all, but Civilization VI tops the cake as absolute trash and ruining my opinion of the franchise. Guessing some woke affirmative action nonsense management took over and hoping this review helps someone not make the mistake of buying Civ 6 and just to stick with Civ 5 unless you want to waste your money."
127,"good game, got on a deal years ago 
runs smooth
good scenarios"
128,its good
129,..
130,its okay
131,the greatest grand strategy game in all times
132,How I change this version to the original?
133,Damn I love this game so much! Guys if u're lazy and bully to computer? Try it Venice!!!
134,pp gud
135,"My favorite Civ game of all time and that is saying something. The graphics are good enough, the narrator is probably the best one they could have got with Liam Neesen(sp). The battles aren't my favorite with one unit per hex but can be fun after you get the hang of it. Plenty of Civs to choose from(30+ i think) and lots of paths to victory with at least 4 victory conditions. There is faith, culture, technology, lots of fun building, Wonders, world and natural, you can go from Chariots to Mechs.  Trust me, this is the best civ game you will ever play."

142,very good few glichis
143,Fun strategy game
144, BEST  GAME EVER
145,"It plays well and is very interesting for anyone who loves history or enjoys strategy games. Have been a player of Civ since Civ 1 and this one has the best random map generator since Civ 2.  It has better graphics then Civ 4 and a fairer AI then Civ 3. With the new Mods it is on par with Civ 4 and fixes my decades complaint about insuffiencent  AI.  It balances a modest strategic game with a generous amount of  history, politics and science that equals a lo tof challenges and hours of gaming fun."
146,"Awesome game
"
147,"this is literally the perfect civilization game. not overly complex, yet still requires critical thinking. wonderful."
148,"It's good,"
149,"Ignore Civ VI, save your money, buy this."
150,Good game.
151,h
152,Based game for a based man

157,"i like it
"
158,"Love it, better than Civ 6."
159,its good
160,"Great game and all, if only I could play it. The launcher is coded to not start the game, and there exists no universal solution."
161,"Arguably the most gratifying computer game ever produced. Far better than Civ 6. We have 2,500 hours of play, and continue to play this game more than any other, 12 years after it first became available on Steam. It is the only program that has ever made us constantly want to continue playing ""one more turn"", and to be the first game we want to play during the day."

178,"One of the most legendary games of all time. There are few games that achieve a similar amount of awe. Yet in this case, it's full deserved. Endless fun is one way to describe it. The game itself has its own culture, its own feel, it feels authentic and real. When I say culture, I mean that it is not afraid to interact with the world. It makes a great game by showing us the great world of our own. Our own world wonders, our own painters, our own artists. All cherished in one simple game.

184,"So 2K, in their boundless wisdom decided to break not just their most recent offering with a pointless update that added a beyond-useless launcher, but made their game take a miracle to get started to play, but broke this previous version, as well, and made it unlaunchable.

Brilliant. Just brilliant."
185,great mind n time passing game cool history
186,its so fun fam
187,"CIV V (Gods&Kings and Brave Mew World editions) is the best version of Civilization.  

CONS:  Unlike Civ II, the technology advancement is badly inaccurate (forget about learning history from this game).  The game gets slower toward the end because the AI is struggling with much more complex actions than it did at the beginning of the game.  

PROS: However, the game balance is good, map generator is good, complexity and replayability is excellent, graphics are good and allow you to suspend disbelief to some degree when looking at units.    The game also has tons and tons of mods (although be careful with them because some will crash your game).  I have about 30 mods running now successfully, but only after isolating which mods were causing crashes.  If you try to use the Mods, add them only a few at a time so that it is easier to figure out which one is bad when/if the game acts up at some point.  Hint - the culprit is often a civilization that you added (perhaps 20% will crash the game at some point after you have played for a while).  Write down the mods that work/don't work after testing - that way if you have to reinstall windows or put it on a new computer, you can recreate the working Mods and not have to guess at which ones worked when you last played.

I am still playing this long after CIV VI came out.  What is wrong with CIV VI in comparison?  I tried CIV VI and was rapidly disappointed.  From what I observed:  1) the graphics in CIV VI are now dorky and cute, which may be fun but makes suspension of disbelief impossible. 2) It is even less realistic in technological advancement, 3) makes technology changes and other advancements more complicated than they are in CIV V, They seem to produce a broad spectrum of very minor changes each time, which reduces the decisiveness of your decisions and makes it too hard to decide which invention or construction to do. AND they want you to plan where to put your buildings in your city in advance!  If you don't allow the appropriate space for the construction you will build later in the game, you are penalized.  Which means it does not play like history, where you invent and build as you go, but more like a God-like game where you use your vast knowledge of the technology tree and many plays to plan all of history in advance (at least as far as cities are concerned.

So get CIV 5 and not 6."

213,Love this game. First computer game I got and every summer I come back to grind it. Definitely worth the time. This is a feel good game that you can take any direction from war mongering the world to trying to survive deity.
214,It's Civ V.
215,Chess with real life history at stake :-)
216,Great gameplay. Ive been playing Civ since the 90s and this is by far the best version.
217,the best turn based strategy game available
218,"140+ hrs on CIV VI.
1080+ hrs on CIV V.

'nuff said."
219,Love this game.  Highly Recommend
220,This has been my favourite game for years.  I have had games that last for months and it is my go to game when I just want to relax.
221,"great strategic game, think about it; there is a reason its still in the top most played games after 14 years."
222,I love this game. I personally think that its one of the best turn based strategy games ever. I really recommend trying this game out if you enjoys chill turn based games.
223,"great game, been a fan of civ for long time. this game eats up time, it is so good."

231,"It's decent, get the DLC"
232,"So I have not played this game in years. Just like civ 6 something has gone wrong. Will not load 90% of the time and crashes within minutes. I have at least 20 other games on steam that work perfect, just CIV 5 and 6 do not work."
233, definitely one of the games of all time
234,"I am a 43 year old father, probably one of the oldest people playing this game. I am a single father to my son, who is now 14. My son recently started Civ5 and in less than a week, he had already played for over 20 hours. This was terrible for me, as it was already hard enough for me to spend time with my son, as he is always out with his friends or just watching videos on Tiktok. So i decided to make a Steam account and get this game to see if I could maybe play alongside him. I loaded into the game, looked at the menu, but I was stuck on what you where supposed to do. I asked my Son for help and he hosted a game for me to join. I loved it as it was the best time I had spent with my Son since my wife had died. This game has ever since brought my son and I closer again and now we actually spend time together outside the house as well. This game reminded me that there's fun to be had in everything, and it has brought both me and my Son many happy memories."
235,One of the best games of all time.

255,"Hey guys, just so you know I am not the type of person who goes into great depths regarding game mechanics, AI etc but CIV 5 is ideal for those who don't have the patience to get involved with a game's steep learning curve! I also have CIV 6, but it is more sophisticated! CIV 5 is simple and entertaining and I would definitely recommend it over CIV 6 even though the graphics of the latter is better! Then again, I am not one who falls for fancy graphics when it comes to a game! Hope this helped!"

264,i mean. its a Sid Meiers Civ game. I shouldnt have to tell you anything.
265,"I've sunk quite a few hours into this game and I still have absolutely no idea how some things work. There's a lot of stuff that makes no sense at all. Other factions will declare war on me for no reason, many mechanics are poorly explained, trading is a complete waste of time as every faction you try to trade with just tries to screw you over and if you propose a fair deal they get insulted. The upgrades that you get as time passes seem almost unimportant and they tend to be very random. If the game just had a much better tutorial system to properly explain each and every thing about the game, I'd probably like it a lot more. The production quality is good, I think. My main gripe is that the way some things work is a complete mystery."

Thanks."

312,By far the better of the Civ games. Religion portion ruined civ 6 for me. Civ 5 is the best.
313,"It's a classic, fun to play solo or with friends."
314,"It is a great game, I love the gameplay and strategy, however: There is a bug with the workers, that they will stop working after every turn, which is quite annoying and it takes a lot of time to just order them to do whatever they where doing every turn. When a game has been out for more than 10 years, I think the developers should have addressed this bug.
Otherwise its great, I love it and it is very addicting."

327,GREAT GAME
328,"I got this game at the urging of two friends. I was a bit hesitant at first because the learning curve seemed very steep compared to the Battle of Polytopia, a similar game that I had already spent months playing. The $30 price tag didn't do much to waive my concerns, especially because Polytopia was free on mobile. But then my friends reminded me of the refunding system in steam that would let me play the game for a couple of hours and then be able to get my money back if i didn't like it.

After waiting less than 20 minutes for Civ 5 to dowload, I played for those couple of hours with my friends.

68 hours of playing after, I have no regrets. While the learning curve is much steeper compared to the Battle of Polytopia, Civ 5 provides many resources for players to get mini tutorials on every aspects of the game as they come up. You may be overwhelmed at first, but after a few minutes of reading tutorial messages or talking to an experienced friend, you'll get the hang of it. 

Civ 5 is a game that you can easily sink dozens of hours into. Alternatively, you could also play one turn at a time in <5 minutes sessions, even online if you are playing with friends. This is a rare, convenient option that greatlyenhances the playability of the game. 

Civ 5 has great depth to it. There are a million different strategies the you can chose from thanks to more than a dozen unique civilizations, 8 social policy tracks, close to 100 technologies to research, dozens of units to train, dozens of building to construct, dozens of unique wonders to build, and half a dozen methods of winning the game. Not to mention the many 'currencies' that you have to balance, including food for city growth and production for city effectiveness.

Civ 5 also has a vast pool of customization options to dive into, from map size to map type player count to AI difficulty to map type to viable methods of winning to custom civilization names and many more. This makes it so that you can fine tune the game to fit how you like to play, which is especially important for a game that can take double digit hours to play through.

All of that being said, there are a few things about the game that aren't as fantastic. To be clear, these are most certainly out-shadowed by the many good things in the game, and many of the problems I am about the list are fixed or mitigated DLC's, although nothing has been so problematic that I have felt the need to spend additional money on the game. Anyways, here are some of the problems I have with the game. First, the game has really cool animations for combat between units and cities. This wouldn't be a problem, except that the animation forces you to watch it; not only for you but also for each and one of your allies' troops. It gets annoying to the point me and my amigos keep it disabled at all times expect nuclear warfare. Second issue is really many issues: balancing. While there are many units, buildings, strategies, etc. that a player can employ in Civ 5, unfortunately there are some options that just aren't worth picking because the better options are so much better. One example of this is the Hanging Gardens wonder. Building this wonder can take you from being slightly behind in city growth to four times ahead in an extremely short number of turns. To make matters worse, only one person in the entire game can build the Hanging Gardens, meaning there is always going to be one person that has the advantage. This is one of the problems that DLC's can fix, I have been told. Another really annoying imbalance is in unit v unit combat. Units only have 10 health, no matter what. And, there combat strength typically scales with their current health. The imbalanced part is that, although you are given a preview of how a fight between two units would go down, nothing is guaranteed. The damage that units do is slightly randomized, so a 'Decisive Victory' against a low health enemy unit could end up being the end of your own, similarly-healthed unit. Again, this is a problem that can be mitigated with DLC's. The final imbalance I'll mention is between the various civilizations in the game. Obviously, some are going to be better than others, especially in different circumstances. But the best civilizations are rarely bad and the bad civilizations are rarely good, and the disparity is such that my friends, who have 5 times the playing time I do always reserve the right to 'mulligan' if they get a bad random tribe, even knowing that I'm playing a mid-tier tribe myself.

tl;dr is that Civ is a very fun game that is very flexible. It can take a bit to get used to, but it is well worth the time to get used to the game. You will quickly start having a lot of fun and you will consistently see improvements in your success, even after hundreds of hours of playing."

338,"My name is Walter Hartwell White. I live at 308 Negra Arroyo Lane, Albuquerque, New Mexico, 87104. This is my confession. If you're watching this tape, I'm probably dead, murdered by my brother-in-law Hank Schrader. Hank has been building a meth empire for over a year now and using me as his chemist. Shortly after my 50th birthday, Hank came to me with a rather, shocking proposition. He asked that I use my chemistry knowledge to cook methamphetamine, which he would then sell using his connections in the drug world. Connections that he made through his career with the DEA. I was... astounded, I... I always thought that Hank was a very moral man and I was... thrown, confused, but I was also particularly vulnerable at the time, something he knew and took advantage of. I was reeling from a cancer diagnosis that was poised to bankrupt my family. Hank took me on a ride along, and showed me just how much money even a small meth operation could make. And I was weak. I didn't want my family to go into financial ruin so I agreed. Every day, I think back at that moment with regret. I quickly realized that I was in way over my head, and Hank had a partner, a man named Gustavo Fring, a businessman. Hank essentially sold me into servitude to this man, and when I tried to quit, Fring threatened my family. I didn't know where to turn.
Eventually, Hank and Fring had a falling out. From what I can gather, Hank was always pushing for a greater share of the business, to which Fring flatly refused to give him, and things escalated. Fring was able to arrange, uh I guess I guess you call it a ""hit"" on my brother-in-law, and failed, but Hank was seriously injured, and I wound up paying his medical bills which amounted to a little over $177,000. Upon recovery, Hank was bent on revenge, working with a man named Hector Salamanca, he plotted to kill Fring, and did so. In fact, the bomb that he used was built by me, and he gave me no option in it. I have often contemplated suicide, but I'm a coward. I wanted to go to the police, but I was frightened. Hank had risen in the ranks to become the head of the Albuquerque DEA, and about that time, to keep me in line, he took my children from me. For 3 months he kept them. My wife, who up until that point, had no idea of my criminal activities, was horrified to learn what I had done, why Hank had taken our children. We were scared. I was in Hell, I hated myself for what I had brought upon my family. Recently, I tried once again to quit, to end this nightmare, and in response, he gave me this. I can't take this anymore. I live in fear every day that Hank will kill me, or worse, hurt my family. I... All I could think to do was to make this video in hope that the world will finally see this man, for what he really is"

435,"[I recommend getting the Complete Edition to get the most out of this game]
This game absolutely fucks. The motto ""Just 1 more turn"" didn't come out of thin air. This game is honestly one of the most addicting I've ever played and there's still a very active community behind this game, even though it came out in 2010.

Is this really worth the cost in 2022? Absolutely, yeah. In my opinion, I believe Civilization V is the best Civ game, and it's due to the sum of it's parts rather than each little thing separately. I'll talk about some of the reasons I recommend this game below:

1- The gameplay is enticing, and this game can also be easy to pick up and play if you're used to other games of this genre. Even if you are not, the tutorial pop-ups, although more annoying after more playthroughs, does a pretty alright job at explaining it all and what's happening on the screen. If you get annoyed with the pop-ups and want to learn some other way (I don't blame you in all honesty), watch some YouTube videos. Either by watching playthroughs, tutorials or more in-depth explanation, you'll be playing good in no time. I personally recommend watching The Solar Gamer's Civ V playthroughs, they do a pretty good job on the whole shtick of Civ V.
Be warned though, this game has some differences to other Civ games. I recommend looking this up if you're used to playing Civ IV or VI.

2- I dig the graphics quite a lot. Although this might seem strange, considering the strategic board-esq nature of it all, but I find the HUD, map and overall leaders quite appealing. It also makes this title stand out above other Civ games due to the others' ""cartoonish"" leaders and different layout and aesthetic. Although I admire the artistic choice of the other Civ games, I much prefer Civ V's appearance, due to the more ""realistic"" nature of it all.

3- The replayability of it all is just gross. I've seen people with 3k hours+ typing reviews and I can see why (More on this later). For starters, you have the Leaders themselves, that all have different percs and abilities. Only this, in it's essence, makes no 2 saves alike, which boil down to more gameplay and whatnot. But you might be asking ""How did I burn more than 250 hours on this""? With the ""Set Up Game"" option, you can choose basically anything about the save you go in, with so many neat options, maps and stuff that it can very much overwhelm you if you're not careful. My advice on my first playthrough is just choose whatever Leader you want, with the 2 Difficulty, with the Continents map and with some YouTube usage under your belt. After that save ends, feel free to spread your wings around a little and see what other stuff this game has to offer to spice up your save and your gameplay (Which in essence, is a lot of stuff). It can go from Civilization, Map, Victory Types, Difficulty, and some other neat tricks you can customize from the ""Set Up Game"" option.

4- The community is still very active. There's a ton of mods for this game, which vary from being purely aesthetical to making a whole different game. Also in order to squeeze everything this game has to offer, I recommend you get some of these mods as well, as some of these are sensational and really just compliment to the game.
Mods I recommend: R.E.D Modpack (Aesthetical), In-Game Editor (To fool around), Lekmod and Vox Populi (More Civs, Rebalancing and more stuff). Keep in mind you can download whatever mod you want, these are my recommendations. There's a whole bunch of Reddit threads about Civ V and it's mods if you want to dig deep into that.

Pros:
1- Gameplay is addictive and very fun;
2- Plenty of ways to spice up your saves, no 2 save games are alike;
3- Very active community, which a lot of mods that are basically essential at this point;
4- The realistic graphics and overall appearance of it all;
5- The tutorial system is alright, although it can be a bit annoying at times (You can disable it in your options);
6- Mods really carry a fair bit of this game and takes it to the next level;

Cons:
1- AI can be a bit buggy and messy (There are mods for this);
2- Some Civs are clearly better than others (There are mods for this);
3- Plenty of changes that makes this a very separate title to other Civ games (Hilariously, there are mods for this as well);
4- Some difficulties are downright unfair (6+ is probably where I'll draw my line, although some people like it);
5- As you can see, you might need some mods in order to play this game at it's full potential;

Final rating: 9,5/10. Although the base game is fantastic, the mods for this game is what makes a 8/10 into a 9,5. The community really stepped up in order to make this game even better than what it is, which also made me really happy in my purchase of this game and the hours I sank onto it. I would recommend this game to anyone that enjoys strategy or history itself. This is an awesome game."

454,"fun, lots of ways to replay."
455,Yes I would recommend this game

457,I've seen all I need to see
458,Love being a warmongering menace in this game
459,"[h1]Your decisions will shape history itself...[/h1]

[b][u]PROS[/u]:[/b] Civilization V is a turn based strategy title, & is widely considered one of the best in it's field.  The switch from a grid to a hexagonal based system feels like a stronger improvement, allowing for a larger array of connected tiles while also doing away with stacking units on a single piece.  Certain aspects have been simplified to attract new players in that help improve the game all around.  The slow build of a settlement to a futuristic city is still just as smooth, & the slowly growing borders of a civilization also adds to the feeling that the culture is growing.  The combat is smoothed out, with individual stacked buffs & nerfs on every troop.  The various policies & wonders a culture decides to make suit certain playstyles, & every civilization still has a personalized leader with their own unique trait, as well as buildings or units.  Scenarios are also added for more streamlined games with a more controlled environment, & can be some fun to play through.  The visuals are nice to look at, & the music just is a joy to listen to in a relaxing way.  Finally, the embracing of the workshop allowed for an array of completely custom content, including new world leaders, & was more than a welcome addition.

[b][u]CONS[/u]:[/b] The first real problem this game has is that diplomacy simply doesn't work.  This doesn't mean earning a diplomatic victory is impossible, it means dealing with other leaders on a nation by nation basis doesn't work.  Other leaders will never take any sort of agreement unless either they offer it, or it ridiculously favors them in every regard with no middle ground.  This even includes accepting peace while at war when they are a turn away from losing.  City-states can be just as much of a nuisance to deal with.  Espionage is a good concept, but only seems to be a factor when playing at higher difficulties.  The scenarios are also problematic, with some being absurdly unfair.  Unfortunately, the specter that continues to haunt the franchise is that the computer cheats on the highest difficulty setting, so adding that to the more difficult scenarios means completing them requires a precise course of action & an exact line of play from the computer with little deviation allowed to succeed.  Finally, & this is a bit of a nitpick, online matches can go on forever due to every player moving, making it games with friends can take well over 8 hours to complete a single game.

[b][u]ACHIEVEMENTS[/u]:[/b] Dear lord this list is not for the faint of heart.  There are plenty of simple ones to lull one in.  However, the grind, challenges, & scenarios drag the entire process to a crawl.  The grind achievements are what one can expect.  The challenges have some ludicrous conditions that almost seem only doable in multiplayer by having a friend set the conditions up.  Worst of all, the scenarios have challenge achievements for themselves, providing little wiggle room for success.  Finally, some actually require the player to disable some of the DLC to achieve.  This will definitely be a long haul of a list for anyone looking to complete it.

[b][u]FINAL[/u]:[/b] Civilization V is still a fun game to pick up & play, earning it's title as one of the best strategy titles.  It's addictive one more turn gameplay, relaxing visuals & soundtrack, & deep challenge can easily keep the player coming back for just one more game.  Despite it's flaws, Civilization V is still worth a look to any fan of the genre, & is an easy title to showcase for those new to it as well."
460,"Lets be honest... We all just end up cheating to get the nukes and blow up every other person's city. They call us a war monger, I call us tacticians, geniuses, and heroes! Anyone who plays these games normally has a lot more patience than I do, but you know, still gotta nuke'm.

7/10 fun with war"
461,playtime
462,"Gonna write review, first just gonna finish this one turn..."
463,GOOD GAME
464,The best version of the Civilization series. Lots of variety and a good range of levels from the Newbie to the world conquering megalomaniac. Game play is simple and straightforward to allow you to play against humans or the dreaded AI.
465,Still a Great game.
466,"got me back into turn based strategy games.

again playing multiplayer with mates is highly recommended"
467,"Definite thumbs-up
I liked Civ-4... then Civ-5 came out and I liked it even more. In Civ5 - the Civ Game came of age, I feel.
I was excited when Civ-6 came out but I couldn't - really... get into it, even tho I wanted to.
Same with Beyond Earth (BE), I excitedly bought the game straight away, but I don,t enjoy it... really. 
BE is a bit 'soul-less' long-winded path to nowhere feels like, not immersive, at all (and I like sci-fi and outer-space stuff).
Civ-6 lost the tactical simplicity of Civ-5. 
Developers seem to think that making the game better, means making it more complicated, but I feel they made Civ-6 more convoluted, tedious, soul-less, and less immersive and less fun. I play a game, to have fun not as a chore to finish. 

I played 2,500 hrs+, of Civ-5; but... I don't think I ever - even finished - a game of Civ-6 or BE.
...so there you have it
I come back to Civ-5 every couple of months and play a couple of games.
...And the MODS for Civ-5 are amazing - huge variety of just about everything"
468,nice
469,"great game
"
470,Both calming and stimulating in the best way possible
471,"I have tried to get into Civilization, but have not managed to like it yet."
472,It is a game?
473,"this is a perfect video game
like there are no flaws whatsoever 
buy this now"
474,"What i like is that you can build an empire and make allies with other AI's or players. Everybody, (including AI's) I've met are so nice to me, and i like that too. choosing your character is fun too, and I personally like Catherine. Yes, i recommend this game to anybody and everybody who looks into it."
475,Can be played through multiple times and still fine interesting
476,pretty good game
477,Great game. Recommend. Better than Civ VI.
478,Sweeping in with nuclear submarines after your friend has just finished a brutal campaign against an AI is a true show of friendship. 10/10
479,it's ok
480,Still deciding if I like the game or not. ?/10

488,"I Want To Like It
Fun View Of World History
Finished A Match Once"
489,"I played over 2k hours on this game growing up and realized i never left a review. For a long time it was my fav game of all time. an incredible choice, a masterpiece from sid meier. This is probably a moot point now, but a 10/10."
490,"I've played 2,935 hours, so far. I love the game."
491,"Nothing compares to this game 9.5/10. Civ6 rubbish cartoon graphics hatted it with a passion, I still play Civ5 with all the new added mods."
492,Don't trust Gandhi.
493,good
494,"Extremely easy to get into, insanely hard to master, this game has it all. Thankfully Civ 5 doesn't have as many DLCs as civ 6, and the DLCs in this one are very impactful, I would get this over civ 6 for replayability, content, and for that itch of this type of game. 9/10."
495," I love this game. It is great for the adult nerdy types like me who knows a bit about history and world geography. CIV-5 vs CIV-6 is more realistic characters and far less cartoon-ish. The challenge is present even at lower difficulty levels. The other thing I like is that the military strategy takes its lessons from Sun Tzu's ""Art of War. "" This dimension of reality keeps my attention and captures my imagination. Great Game."
496,"Simply put, having played every Civ, with every expansion, I can say that while this isn't the latest, it is the greatest. It is bookended by IV and VI: the former, a masterpiece coming in a close second to V, itself closely followed by II - the latter, a disappointing execution of high potential ideas.

With Civ, I recommend against ""one more game"" syndrome. Stick with fully unlocked versions of V, or IV, or II: because beyond this, there be dragons.

PS, No matter what Civ you choose, Google how to disable the 2k Launcher. I don't know if I can be more specific without possibly breaking ToS? But hopefully that warning will suffice, and you can thank me later."
497,Good old school strat game
498,good game
499,"What I dislike about this product is that I have to waste time writing this garbage, rather than simply giving it a thumb up."
500,I like it.
501,bonanza
502,Greatest game ever created
503,Classic game for building empires!
504,All the civs are great games. I like this one the best out of all!
505,Good game. Worth checking out.
506,very fun game indeed
507,"Honest to god and amazing game with time less amounts a game time that you could enjoy with friends alike
"
508,what is wrong with me
509,Fun game
510,Most addicting game ever.
511,The best Civ version in my opinion! Love this game.
512,Never exactly the same.  Keeps me interested.
513,Deep and utterly engaging. One of my top 10 games of all time.
514,Game is very fun
515,Great game!
516,"Definitely recommend, the mods and the mods community make this game even better."
517,"A now-dated instant classic.

The best of the Civ games, if you're a collector buy them all, but if you only want to buy one Civ to play, buy this one, not the newest game."
518,"There is no improvements from civ 4, it is a copy paste with the only thing that added was bad ai that betray you every 10 seconds. The diplomacy is an absolute mess, tech is way too overpowered, it is impossible to establish a meaningful alliance, the AI have terrible city placement therefore you have to either raze the city or deal with a badly placed one. The trade route system is way to finicky and it puts your entire civ into bankruptcy if the trade route gets blocked. Cities constantly demand luxury resources even if you currently cant see any on the map and cant trade for it with other civs making you have to build a city thousands of miles away to get get said resource which bankrupts your civ. City states takes thousands and thousands of gold just to get one luxury resource from them. The UI is also completely terrible. Some workers will bug out and require you to order them to restart improving a tile over and over. You can no longer delay unit promotions so they cant be used effectively. There are millions of other issues with this game. Not worth what i spent on this game."
519,Good Game. Better than VI.
520,Super Fun Game
521,"Declares war on England. Everyone denounces England instead of me.
10/10 for realism."
522,I enjoy the different levels of difficulty as well as the learning of so many great nations of the past.
523,"I have played every iteration of Civilization since the very first game in 1991. Civ 5 is the best of the bunch - far superior to the successor, Civ 6. Civ 5 is the gold standard for all turn-based strategy games."
524,It's a long game for one match but has lots of features compared to the previous games to keep you busy. Overall a great game. 7.5 out of 10
525,trying to win on deity and keeps crashing on my only good game but yeah pretty good overall
526,I have a large Thumb.
527,"A lot to unpack when you first start which can be daunting, but it's more an issue of how much you need to learn rather than how difficult, as most of it is pretty basic and can be logically understood. Science is essentially split into categories with military on the bottom, policies are great but can be ignored (just click whatever) until you learn more of the game, use the auto-build worker option that causes them to build optimal things automatically (until you figure out citizen management, luxury resources, and city tile range), and as a rule of thumb, science is probably always the best thing to go for if you are unsure."
528,FUN
529,Hours of fun and challenges
530,7
531,It's fun to play with a group!
532,It's like Risk but with more freedom of choice. Great replay value--enough customization options that you don't get bored playing over and over.
533,good stuff if you like strategy games

542,"game keeps crashing, you need to uninstall and reinstall to play the game, if tyou play tihs game you need to play all the way through with out saving as if you save the game you may need to uninstall and reinstall to play which will delete your saved game"
543,sucks
544,"great game
"
545,"I'll keep this short and sweet. After resisting for a long time, I find this game to be the best Civ game. I really enjoyed 6 and played it a ton, but this game keeps bringing me back. It is far more of a easy-to-learn/hard-to-master type game than Civ 6, since it is extremely accessible from the outset. There are far fewer rules and complications with learning the game. Just the absence of districts in this game along account for much of this. But this game is proof that even with a million gimmicks, you cannot surpass a great game. 

Highest recommendation."
546,If you know Civ 5 you know.
547,"I always love this game since CIV 1 back in the 90´s. There are many ways to play it, and I like to play on the hardest level, because the strategy must be perfect. There must be a policy for land expansion, cities growth, science evolution, infraestrcture, economics and prevention of social unrest. Also, the war games are incredible, with lots of warfare strategy. But if you´re starting now, go first for the easy level, learn the basics, and dont be shy to look things in the civilopedia."
548,is ait
549,"This game always satisfies my desire to feel like I'm exploring new parts of the world, run my own town, or complete domination over my enemies. Do I need help?"
550,Game is pretty good
551,fun.
552,fun and very long
553,Good game.
554,Classic m8
555,I've plunged the world into 35 Nuclear winters. 10/10
556,"Really good game, but SO BUGGY

You WILL be randomly booted out of the game.  A LOT.

**Good** classic game...  but it is buggy as you can imagine.

Use Auto-save FREQUENTLY, and set your expectations for ""game stability circa 1992.""

You WILL get randomly booted out of the game.  Other than that it is a good time.  Play Ghandi as a marauding pillager?  Yeah, that is possible also."
557,One of the bet games ever made. just fun and something that you can sink some time into.
558,pretty good
559,Game doesnt even open anymore what a garbage game and garbage company DO NOT waste a cent on this pathetic low effort company. Your money is better used on companies who make their GD games actually function GTFO Sid meier
560,You can nuke the equivalent of a stone age tribe and turn their cities into nuclear testing grounds 10/10 would commit horrible crimes again.
561,A solid real time strategy game from the late 90s. many hours of playing.
562,"I usually play civ 6 now, but for a less complicated game overall, Civ 5 is an excellent game. I played this alot as a kid and it is very well refined with all DLC. ALL DLC IS A MUST, It plays so much better with dlc. Get the whole thing on a sale and have fun for many many hours.

Multiplayer with friends is also extremely fun and you should do it."
563,great game! lots of replayability
564,Still the King of RTS.
565,"Barely have any hours for the game but it's pretty fun, still have a lot of the DLCs to still go through"
566,"Really complex, but in a good way. So many areas to consider-- religion, culture, diplomacy. You can play one game for a week if you wanted to. Love this so much."
567,"Oldie but a goodie. Still holds up content wise
"
568,great game!
569,"At this point it would be fair to consider Civilization V a classic. The only negative I have with this game is how addictive it can get. My playtime isn't that high but that is intentional. I put 43 hours in over two gaming session that lasted 3 days each. Once I start, I find it very hard to stop. 

Play at your own risk!"
570,So gud
571,"2737 hours. The mods the community make, make this game playable forever.  Because of the modding community, one of the best games ever."
572,fantastic
573,"masterpiece
genuinely fun even for long periods of time"
574,This ish is tight.
575,bravo
576,just one more turn....
577,one of the best!
578,I've played for 328 hours and have 110 achievements. It would be disingenuous to say I wouldn't recommend it.
579,"Fun game, both mindless and mindful, so I can knit while playing and not feel like I'm being useless"
580,"They broke it with this last update, can't play. Won't launch."
581,fun
582,"Literally have not played it, but my mom has."
583,Brought giant death robots to bare on enemies that hadn't even discovered gunpowder yet. 10/10
584,⠀
585,"This game has lower system requirements than civ 6, but features almost the same game system. Civ 4 is basically still civ 2, and most computers can handle civ 5, so this is probably the most accessible version."
586,i love sid
587,It cool
588,The pinnacle of Civ
589,Civ 6 without the bugs
590,Great casual 4x. Without rival.
591,im glad they improved upon civ 6 with this one
592,it's alright i guess
593,Come on it's CIV V you know how good it is
594,"This might be my all time favorite in the series. I prefer it to Civ VI.  Very re-playable.   
"
595,its alright
596,frustration guaranteed
597,"Game difficulty ""Deity"" is more around luck than skill. It does say only the best player in the world can beat this difficulty, they forgot to mention the part ""if they are lucky"". Good game I guess. Deity ruined it for me."
598,Best Civ ever.
599,civ v is very good game
600,no
601,YES
602,"For how old this gaming is slowly is becoming, it is a game with plenty to do, and personally, one of if the best in the franchise. With many nations to play, it allows flexability and adds the flavor of ""Easy to learn, Hard to Master."" The graphics are easy to look at and the theme of the game simply shown when starting the game is fantastic. One of my personal favorites and that's not including the insane amount of mods that you can play."
603,Probably one of the best games ever created 11/10
604,the challenges are interesting but not impossible.   It really isn't boring!
605,This is a very good game worth every pretty penny. It has in depth strategy and the difficulty is pleasing and 99% fair. A True Masterpiece!
606,Tremendous
607,"fabulous,  like 6 dimensional risk"
608,love this game
609,IT'S A STRATEGY GAME THAT REQUIRES YOU TO PLAN AHEAD. YOU NEED TO BE FLEXIBLE TO MEET THE UNKNOWN. DIFFERENT LEVELS OF OF THIS GAME CHANGE YOUR CIV'S CHANCES OF SUCCESS.
610,yes
611,Game's good
612,absolute bull**** that i can't stop playing. Times flies faster through this game than the olden days of playing minecraft with the boys.
613,electronic crack! DO NOT download this game.......you will NEVER get enough of it! 4000hrs. and still as good as day 1.
614,it's good
615,This is my favorite version. I'm still learning strategies and ways to win after playing 2392 hours. I love this game.
616,Gotten like 6 Jeopardy questions correct thanks to this masterpiece. Timeless classic.
617,Great Game!!
618,This game is awesome. 10/10 recommend.
619,oh god oh f*ck the huns found me again oh god
620,"be so fucking careful playing this game. I dreamed of Civ V. I've only had it three days as of this review, and logged eight hours today. This is scary. I WILL be playing more."
621,time vacuum™
622,Great replayability! Never a dull game.
623,All around good fun
624,its alright.
625,I have 420 hours so I have to retire. good game
626,Possibly my favorite game ever.
627,Still the best civilization game in existence
628,"clash of clans for men

629,Its cool game
630,"Great game, very relaxing."
631,"I could play just this game forever, it's time consuming to learn all the ins-and-outs especially with DLC but it's a gem still to this day. Very complex AI (for the most part) that go from baby easy to incredibly, incredibly challenging. Won't regret this purchase if you put a little time in to learn."
632,This game reminds me that i'm depressed. 10/10
633,had sound issues had to reinstall the game now I have lag or slow issues with the game it just doesn't end
634,ive played almost 900 hours playing Civ 5 in my life... along with countless civ 4 and civ3.. highly recommend.
635,just one more turn. mods. great for those who love board games.
636,great game
637,Make me bitch
638,PRETTY GOOD IT HINK
639,yes
640,ITS MORE ADDICTING THAN METH PLEASE HELP
641,This game is the shit
642,"I like this more than CIVILIZATION VI despite it lacking some really nice features that the sixth game provides. There's just some really nice feeling this game has in terms of look, UI, and play feeling. Coming from thousands of hours in Europa Universalis IV, I feel like this is the best option to get started with CIVILIZATION if you're a previous PARADOX INTERACTIVE player!"
643,Probably the best Civ game.
644,game sucks
645,"The vanilla game is endlessly replayable for my taste. The other expansions make for a different game, which is great value."
646,"It's a good game if you just want to pick up something and play it for 15 hours straight with no breaks.



I played it until I learned how to beat the AI consistently (defend yourself long enough to get universities, fill both slots, spam great scientist tiles, then rush to industrial revolution). How do I get my friends to play a full fucking game of this with me its so ridiculously long."
647,I really love this game! Recommend it more than the little pigeon statue that I wish I had
648,play it ..good ...game
649,★★★★☆
650,It's better than 6.  Sad that Firaxis is going backwards in game quality.  Civ 5 is probably the high point of the Civ series.  It doesn't have the broken army stacks of earlier games and with the expansions it has a fair bit of depth.  The only thing I wish it had from Civ 6 is the district system which I like.  Well worth a pick up if you can get it and the expansions on sale.
651,good game
652,Did not enjoy
653,this game is amazing tho i have a problem where i cannot open the game
654,"i've racked up 4k hours on this game tho 2 accounts, first reveiw of a videogame, simply put civ 5 with all dlc's best civ made to date...."
655,One more turn
656,It is a good bidogaem
657,I always come back to this game I love it so much even after all these years this game is just so good. If you are trying to get into civ I would recommend this game its the best civ game hands down.
658,using mods i made big boss go to war with miku
659,Always loved war strategy games and this one is still by far one of the best. Not a fan on Civ 6 had it and deleted it.
660,"Just a quick game of Civ, in and out"
661,This is till the pinnacle of the series.
662,this game should have an update
663,In my opinion better that Civ 6
664,"It'a such a fun and addictive game... the learning curve is a little bit steep at first (somewhat overwhelming) but you'll get into it quickly and understand how to play properly... do note that one game is somewhat long (especially with the longer time modes)

"
665,Gandhi big mad
666,Good game
667,this is a great game if you're okay with the minimum learning curve of ~200 hours
668,"A truly incredible game that, in many ways, still holds up to the modern day."
669,A Cult Classic.
670,Hours of your life you won't get back.
671,"Incredible game with seemingly endless replayability. I've yet to get tired of it after 650+ hours, at least. Here's to another 650 more!"
672,10/10 game. 11/10 with mods.
673,This is one of my all-time favourite games.
674,"This game has so many wild unfixed bugs, and feels like it was left dead in the water and unfinished. Best one of the franchise 9.5/10"

683,"It really doesn't click with me: too much abstraction to find the gameplay satisfying, and I never close the game feeling like the time I spent on it was worth it. I only played as much as I did because of multiplayer with friends, but I would never touch this on my own."
684,good
685,everyone needs DLC for DLC to work in MP :(
686,"the character leaders, the map options, all make this highly replayable, like a fresh game everytime."
687,Runs on older computers.  fairly easy to mod and available mods are mature. Some problems with restarting after exit to windows 10
688,My favorite game on steam
689,my favorite turn based game
690,"Civ V is a fun game. It is a strategic game that works your mind and builds you a mind of strategy (at least on the harder levels), playing Civ V helps you play other strategic games. And in Civ V you can learn about different countries and their leaders at different time periods and things those countries did or were good at Over all a fun game."
691,Fun game

707,"Great game, tons of fun!"
708,"I once had a moment when I realized how horrible I was in a game of Sid Meyer's Civilization 4, Beyond the Sword. My empire, mighty India, stretched across a third of the world, An entire continent was at my command, plus a wide sprawling dominion of tropical islands in the seas to the west. My empire wanted for nothing, any material possession was available. But I wasn't happy, for I didn't want any of that. I wanted the one thing I could not have, Supremacy. My empire was grand, but there were others, grander, more powerful, further ahead in technology and culture. So I made a deal with the devil. I re-tooled my empire from a land of prosperity and freedom to a machine of war. I grasped at any advantage I could muster. A caste system to keep my people in line, nationalism to draft unwilling bodies into my army, and sickening coal power plants to light my factories so that they may never cease their toiling. I subjugated any other civilization weaker than me while envying those above me, every move a stepping stone towards invading my more powerful enemies. And one day, I thought I was ready. I had assembled a powerful army and navy to reach out across the oceans and let death touch the lands beyond. Tanks, planes, and marines in their thousands left my shores. My opening move against the portuguese(the second strongest empire, with I as the third) was one of underhanded shock-attack. Their mighty navy lay in its port near their capital, and I struck there, burning the ships in the harbor after the city had fallen. Then, a brutal, pointless war raged for a generation. The landing point was so far from my empire that it took years for reinforcements to reach my battered army every time it was near defeat. And in the end? It didn't matter. The mightiest of the civilizations, the Malinese, intervened in the war, taking in Portugal as their vassal. Their army bore down on all my people had been forced to suffer for like a hammer against clay. Within a few short years I was forced to retreat onto my ships to save what little I could and fall back as they consumed my overseas empire. At this point, the cracks were beginning to show. Unrest from generations of dying choked my cities almost as much as the smog from the factories. My empire was decaying from within, growing feeble from years of neglect. I could've accepted that I could not win. That my position was respectable and enviable, and let my people return to peace, but no. My greed, my arrogence, the darkness that boils within my thoughts could not accept that. So I made my decision. I would wipe the Malinese from the world. Once more I put my people to work building an arsenal. Not one of men and guns, though there was plenty of that. It was an arsenal of ICBMs and tactical nukes, a fleet of submarines to slip by my enemies defenses and attack them where they were vulnerable. It was an arsenal of indiscriminate death, of cruelty, of genocide. I filled the seas around Mali with missile subs and crammed my production centers with ICBMs, but I did not attack. For even with my uniquely mad plans, I knew victory was still beyond my grasp. But then I saw it. Mali had launched a space ship to Alpha Centauri, and if it arrived before I could reduce their homeland to a smoldering waste, I was finished. So I let fly with fire and thunder, Billions died in the opening volley, and a land unblighted by war from centuries of security was torn away to one of suffering and loss. None of the Mali asked to be my enemy, and in truth, my attack did little to cripple Mansa Musa's armies. Almost all that I killed were innocents. All that I brought was suffering.

726,"PROS: relatively easy to get the hang of and easy and fun to play, while still being challenging
CONS: Not Civ VI if what you are looking for is ultimate complexity"
727,"Pure virtual heroin. It's 22:00, so I play one more turn before I go to bed. Maybe two turns. And then I look out the window and see the sun rising"
728,I had been looking for a game like this for some time. I've always liked the fact that you are the king or queen of your kingdom and you can interact with other kingdoms.
729,This game will suck all the free time out of your life.
730,Very Good
731,years later and this is still my favorite time sink as i eat breakfast on sunday mornings

741,"this is a game that you might start playing with a friend or group of friends, but by the end youll all either be against each other or all united in a singular cause to take down the nuclear mad man Ghandi and his kill everything attitude. its also a game that you wont realize its 3 am and youre 50 turns in and just saying one more turn. tis a wonderful game and is extremely fun!"
742,"Turns based game.  It works nicely as a solo game, where neither computer or human is assured of a win."
743,ass
744,Its Civ.  Its great.  enough said
745,Its a really fun game and i especially recommend this when playing with friends
746,"Thumbs down: This has a splash/loading screen after you say run game.  So 1980s

Other than that, the best Civ game that is out there.  Crazy replayability, good variety, and best solo game out there.  Great way to start your day!"
747,A black hole of time. 10/10
748,"I've put over 250 hours into this game, more than any other, and without a doubt this will go down as one of the classics. Better than CIV VI imho especially with Lekmod."
749,Game wont launch anymore. Windows 11
750,great game
751,cool

766,"I can get totally involved in the game,  I like the idea that if I could change history I would like to know how things would be different."
767,"Civ 6 sucks, play this instead"
768,"The best Civ to date, a lot better than the awful Civ 6."
769,taxes game
770,"take your time
"
771,"what a fun game, yet very challenging. seems the skill ceiling is so far beyond me."
772,Lek mod oldum
773,"The best way to disconnect from stressful life is to play this game. I have played CIV5 for well over a decade now, mostly on the easier difficulties, and can fullheartedly recommend it to anyone who is looking for one of those ""just one more turn"" type of games. I would even go as far as to say that CIV5, for me, is the ultimate Just One More Turn -game. Easy to learn the basics, and enough challenges for more experienced player, but also good for just a calming gaming experience."
774,its civ
775,"Nice game. Although you may lose many hours of sleep while playing, I believe that means the devs did something right with this game."
776,"good game

787,Its Civ.
788,I am a big sid meyer's fan
789,i mean its civ 5
790,Another great addition to the Civilization series
791,"It's addictive, what more can I say? It's educating as well if you take the time to read about the leaders and their civ's and the worlds wonders both natural and man made. Their individual histories can be quite interesting. Then there's the art, artists, scientists, writers and their works as well. It's a behemoth of a game, well thought out and can be complex."
792,Love this game.
793,A good one.
794,Classic game
795,fun game
796,This is my safe game. I always come back to it when not knowing what to play

811,Engaging and easy to come back to. I love playing on Marathon playing one game over a few weeks.
812,ayayyayaa
813,Just one more turn...
814,good game
815,"What can I say... it's CIVILIZATION people. You can't love it.
But seriously, I don't like Civ6, and just can't force myself to play it. Just got stuck with Civ5, because of its more ""realistic"" drawing style. Best of Civilization series as for me.
The only downside is that it will take days of your life ;)"
816,Still ass at this game ahaaaa
817,"stable and fine gameplay. definitely outdated, still a good time. if you want to play it seriously, take at least 5 hours time."
818,it good
819,"The best version (fully upgraded, with all DLC) of any Civ version in the franchise, both in terms of strategic scope and balance."
820,Cant do gwag gwag 3000 to daddy Washington

826,it's okay

828,great turn based game that makes you think a lot.
829,Quite a classic to the classics. Manageable addictiveness makes it probably the best since instalment of the first sequel.
830,It's good
831,Best of the current Civ games in my opinion. I do recommend getting an alternative hud addon for easier information gathering. The DLC are also almost a must with exception of some the specific empires. A bit pricey after all additions but the endless play and possibilities are worth the investment.
832,"Extremely good and addictive. Awesome to play with friends and the best game to play after work. After trying this game, you will never play spider solitaire ever again"

846,Vox Populi made this game 1000% enjoyable than any CIV series I ever played
847,They’re all gone! I’ve failed you my workers. 😭
848,"An entertaining, turn-based strategy game that is enjoyable to play solo or with friends."
849,I am amazed at the detail in the game.  The game speed is great. AI is predictable. I have played since 1995 and enjoy every aspect of every game.  Each one gets  better.  Looking forward to Civ 7.
850,yes
851,<3
852,"Despite the fact that the game was released about 12 years ago (as of the time of writing this comment), it still holds well even to this day. It is very easy to run on both Windows and Linux (native and Proton version) without jumping through 10.000 hoops. While the base game is somewhat bare-bones (for a 4X game) the expansions are a great (and I would even consider mandatory) addition to the game expanding on its military (comp.bows, bombers) and infrastructural (something something Petra) variety.

One of the key aspects about the game is its soundtrack. Initially, I believed it to be impossible to top Baba Yetu but regardless of what culture you pick at the start of the game I never found the music annoying or repetitive.  The civs you get to play as (and that is excluding the unofficial community mod support, more on that below) cover the entire globe - anything from Central/South America to the Oceania regions ranging from ancient era leaders like Ramesses II to more modern ones like Otto von Bismarck. The win conditions are straight-forward but you will have to make a decision to pivot into a certain path somewhere in the midgame as transitioning from one victory type to another on the higher difficulties is a bit more difficult (excluding conquest if you are leading in science) compared to Civ VI.  The modding community is massive and I am confident that you will find whatever it is you are looking for and then some: are you annoyed by the slow airplane animations but you do not want to enable quick combat? - there's a mod for that. Do you want to play with your nation but it is not included in the official ones in the game? - the community has you covered. Everything from simple UI mods to complete overhauls (looking at you Vox Populi) can be found in the Steam Workshop page or with a simple Google search.

With everything mentioned so far, I have to briefly discuss the downsides - the late game can be a bit monotonous (once you have played 40-50 games) if you are not gunning for a domination victory as there is very little the AI can do once you widen the culture/science gap. Without mods, the game encourages you to build few big cities instead of multiple smaller ones due to how the social policy mechanic is set up - it is possible to go for a wide play, but you better have an amazing religion or a god-tier start with multiple luxuries otherwise you are stuck up until the mid-late game where you pick an ideology from which you will be getting most your happiness points. The AI itself is not the best in warfare but the other players will gang up on you if you neglect your military in attempt to compensate for their incompetence. Lastly I have to discuss the difficulty system - I am aware that it is exceptionally difficult to program an advanced AI (though the Vox Populi community mod did an incredible job) but playing on Deity (the highest difficulty) in Civ V feels cheap. The AI get such massive and unfair bonuses (2 extra free cities and 50% discount to everything in the game) that the only way to beat them is to min-max to the fullest and pull off every cheap trick that you can think of. I personally find playing on Emperor (sometimes Immortal) to be the best in terms of fairness for my skill level. The game does lack the district system from Civ VI but I think that this is for the best even if the game does force you to build all the buildings in a single city provided you have the time/resources to do so.

Overall, I think that it is one of the best entries in the franchise and definitely the easiest to get into the 4X genre. I can recommend this game to people that are hesitant to try it as the 4X genre as a whole has the reputation of being too complex and not being beginner-friendly which this game manages to side step successfully.

P.S.: Achievements for the English civ are awful and I developed PTSD from not being interested enough in trading agreements."
853,its dope man
854,played base game for 100 hours and it was great enough to buy the extra dlc. Hoping it holds up to standards set.

also i'd recommend getting this on like g2a with all the dlc. 

furthermore play on fractal small map size, then in the lobby add like 12 civs. ITS SO GOOD ISTG if u get a big ass loser ass map with like 4 mfs it will be boring ong. 

also focus science i swear its more important than anything. and military conquests of like even one single city can change the entire game. okay what the fuck are u doing just go play bro"

872,"I like this game because I can play it while I work. You think, move and wait for the computer. You can pause at any time and the game AI can be challenging at the harder levels. Not the newest version, but I really enjoy it."
873,My absolute favorite Sid Meier game hands down!!! I plan on playing way more even though I have Civ 6. I think Civ 5 has been their best title!

889,who doesnt love this game?
890,this game ****ing sucks cause no hitler
891,"This is a Game that can fully scratch the Military leadership/ leading a nation/ Diplomatic interaction/ and that occasional Tyrannical urge that Civilization has always been able to scratch. This is a perfect game to play with friends to take turns on and just get together weekend after weekend making your way through a campaign together. I remember playing as Rome and my friend was Egypt and we had another AI that had a larger army than either of us. I had the ground south of the Alps secured with our enemy moving to attack from the north, I believe it was Germany. Well I was able to hold for just long enough that my ally could move to flank from the east and west on the north side of the alps I lost almost all of my army and he lost a good 20% but we held them at the alps. This secured my cities from anymore threat and from there we marched on Germany and brought their peoples to heel. I have nothing but good times playing this game and with the right amount of strategy and a bit of thought and common sense you can really have a fantastic time playing this game. I love the depth of all the different types of interactions with other leaders in the game, also the wildcards that the city-states introduce to the game. I just love this game and if you enjoy RTS style games and have a general understanding of how the Civilization games play I believe you will too. Also when selecting your Leader take your time weighing the Pros and Cons and adapt your strategy accordingly to maximize the benefits gained. Such as if you have early game troops that are stronger then use that time to your advantage in any of your conquering related endeavors."
892,Big PP Game
893,"Hmm, yes. Hexagons."
894,This timeless addiction of taking just one more turn has yet to be dethroned by the newer Civ games.
895,It gud
896,how to pass turn
897,amazing game 10/10 would recomend
898,"Although now quite aged and succeeded by Civ 6, definitely still worth picking up when on sale. Mechanically Civ 5 is fairly distinct from 6, and for players who enjoy building tall rather than wide, may even still be the preferable iteration of Civ. There is a reason one of the most popular Civ 6 mods is a reskin with Civ 5 graphics."
899,Nutty game
900,Best civ ever. Plays nicely on steam deck.
901,"I like how I am able to build up my civilization, help other, and general  do whatever I want. trust me this game is a must buy if you like deciding the fate of a civilization. Also it's just general fun."
902,"have played every civ game made, and in beginning, saw the sun rise many a time..1,000 of hours ..thank you"
903,that's one of the most addictive games i ever played and its all thanks to the quality of design and execution. Warmly recommended to anyone who enjoys the genre
904,Maybe the real Civ V was the friends we made along the way.
905,"[b] Awesome Game 9/10 [/b] 

Don't start it before going to bed."
906,fun
907,Great game
908,good
909,Best in the series: very streamline experience. Each Civ is unique enough unlike the bat-sh*t overpowered Civs in Civ6.
910,"After each of the latest windows updates (multiple), I would need to re-install Civ 5.   Now this last time Civ 5 doesn't start at all.  Please help!"
911,"yes
"
912,very cool with friends
913,"usually6 play CIV 6. CIV 5 went on sale, so got it. definitely more rudimentary in some respects. better in others. it is better to play with friends but alone against the AI's is a very fast paced game. I enjoy it most of the time, OL."
914,i really fucking hate this game
915,Civilization is the best!
916,gr8 m8 luv it
917,better then civ 6. still my fav civ game
918,"it will kill some time
"
919,"Civ 5 was what started my interest in strategy games back when it first came out, I've put 1k+ hours in it since and haven't regretted it."
920,Still a great game not much more to say here.
921,my favorite strategy game by far!
922,Maybe the greatest game ever designed? Certainly the best board-game strategy video game in existence. On an elite list of games with my total hours played count in the thousands (I've over 2K hours on another profile). One. More. Turn.
923,Great game. Kind of like modern chess.
924,Game keeps crashing.  Pretty sure this is the make you buy Civ VI.
925,I'm still not good at this game...
926,It is alright I guess.
927,Great game. I like it better than Civ 6.
928,yup
929,I love colonizing
930,5/5 would build a spaceship and yeet into space again
931,Pretty OK I guess. Brave New World sucks ass.
932,masterpeice
933,great game!... if you have about 2 days of free time for one game....
934,Graphics are better than Civilization VI so I find that I am more enganged. Whether or not the game actually plays better I can't say since I have only barely played Civ VI for just a few minutes.
935,GOOD GAME
936,Its good
937,Its an awesome game. make sure you fortify cities though because it gets tough on hire difficulties. never trust the Greeks though
938,Great game
939,"trash lmao, gyro uses shoshone like a pussy"
940,it's civ v. It's addicting
941,Played over 100 hours on this account but have played over 9k hours total.  Lost access to my old steam account so enjoy the challenges of starting over and with more experience under my belt.  Definitely would recommend this game as it is by far one of the better series of civilization but still love civilization 3 and 4 as well! Great buy and  great game to play and I'd recommend playing as each civilization!
942,One of my favorite games ever
943,"An excellent game, although dated a bit on graphics."
944,Ghandi has only nuked me once
945,Awesome game to Take OVER THE WORLD WITH
946,its pretty cool
947,"Just one more turn... wait... is that the sun

Probably not the best idea to play this on a work night, still the best CIV by a decent margin in my opinion"
948,I SUCK at the game
949,"Civ V is a great game that you'll lose many hours to. It's incredibly addictive and super fun in both singleplayer and multiplayer. Can't recommend it enough. One thing I will say is that the default UI, while not terrible, could use some work. Fortunately, there's an easy to use mod that fixes this."
950,Its really fun and a time waster
951,i hate this game
952,Far superior to Civ 6
953,Just one more turn...
954,mastahhpiece
955,Fun time waster. chill out game. war mongering is the only way. NO MERCY.
956,it good
957,sick game
958,"It takes a little while to learn it but it's worth it, plus it runs great on my laptop, which is not built for gaming at all."
959,:D
960,My life is melting away with this game
961,Classic Civ game. One of my favorites.
962,"Addictive, incredible, amazing for anyone who likes world-building or expansion games. The different leaders mean there are so many ways to play, and it never gets old."
963,A game that I always come back to

973,Great strategy game
974,"Such a captivating game in terms of ambiance and storytelling. 
Been an addict of all the series so far, I feel like this new chapter contributes a lot to the whole experience of Civilization.
A must for strategy lovers and already a milestone for this kind of games."
975,"meh, pretty good ig"
976,very good way to remove hours of time from the day
977,great
978,"I prefer crusader kings personally
Civ design just ain't there for me"
979,"When it launched, I thought this was the prettiest game I'd ever seen. Going from Civ IV with its blocky blue theme to Civ V with its golden dynamic map felt like moving up to 4k. Of course, it's fallen behind as the years have passed, but it's a sight better than the cartoony way Civ VI looks. 
Plays great, looks great, feels great. 10/10. (If they remaster the graphics, 11/10.)"
980,"Very fun, multiplayer is awesome"
981,this game is awsome!
982,I've been playing this game off and on since I was in high school.  I'm about to graduate law school.  6/10 not bad.

987,Better then 6
988,"One of the best strategy games available by far. I have near 1k time played and I still enjoy learning the Civs. As a casual gamer this is a thick Girl to play with, and she's fun. 9/10"
989,meh...eventually I got bored with it
990,great game
991,"The homemade mac n' cheese of strategy games for me. Not very complicated, but never fails to give me that warm and fuzzy feeling.

Genuinely fun and engaging 10+ years later."

993,It's kinda pog
994,Just playing one or two full matches a year can lead to lasting memories about the empires you once built. I love to think back to my greatest civilizations every now and then.
995,gud game. I played over 500 hours and still not sick of it.
996,i guess i like it!
997,Its amazing but you already know you will lose entire days to a single game and will feel so guilty for neglecting your real life but who cares. Its awesome.

1001,This game has taken over my life
1002,tight as a nun's clam
1003,"Great Game, especially with a few lads to play along. I favour this game, allthough it being the older part of the series, over CIv VI, because I am of the opinion, that it offers a more enjoyable solution concerning general gameplay and the way the progress system is implemented. Over all, big thumbs up !!!"
1004,great game; I've enjoyed playing for years.
1005,this game is so fuN!

1010,it is fun
1011,"Classic strategy and resource-management, worker-management, land management, etc in a historical fiction setting."
1012,Better than Civ 6
1013,Thoroughly enjoyed this game! Great game to play alone or with a partner/group of friends. Hours and hours of fun and any play style works - from simply having fun doing silly little tasks to fighting the entire world. Well worth the money!
1014,"brilliant game, would def recommend"
1015,"I had never played a turn based game properly until this one and I can safely say it's one of the best games I have ever played, set the game speed to something slower and you will have an awesome experience."
1016,"A thoroughly enjoyable, turn based strategy game.
Plenty of nations to play as with unique perks.
Multiple ways to win including domination, diplomacy, and science.
There is even a place for fellow men of culture."
1017,Addicting
1018,Almost as good as Morbius (2022).
1019,"A fun game with or without mods


And of course, the one more turn curse is real"
1020,Yes
1021,Simple but hard to master. It is a very good strategy game that resembles a physical board game. Each civ suites a certain playstyle and gives unique advantages.
1022,"Vintage chocolate chip cookies

Ingredients
150g salted butter, softened
80g light brown muscovado sugar
80g granulated sugar
2 tsp vanilla extract
1 large egg
225g plain flour
½ tsp bicarbonate of soda
¼ tsp salt
200g plain chocolate chips or chunks
Method
STEP 1
Heat the oven to 190C/fan170C/gas 5 and line two baking sheets with non-stick baking paper.

STEP 2
Put 150g softened salted butter, 80g light brown muscovado sugar and 80g granulated sugar into a bowl and beat until creamy.

STEP 3
Beat in 2 tsp vanilla extract and 1 large egg.

STEP 4
Sift 225g plain flour, ½ tsp bicarbonate of soda and ¼ tsp salt into the bowl and mix it in with a wooden spoon.

STEP 5
Add 200g plain chocolate chips or chunks and stir well.

STEP 6
Use a teaspoon to make small scoops of the mixture, spacing them well apart on the baking trays. This mixture should make about 30 cookies.

STEP 7
Bake for 8–10 mins until they are light brown on the edges and still slightly soft in the centre if you press them.

STEP 8
Leave on the tray for a couple of mins to set and then lift onto a cooling rack.

RECIPE TIPS
FREEZING THE BISCUITS
If you’ve frozen the biscuits, take them out and arrange them on a lined baking sheet. Once defrosted, pop them in a medium oven 190C/170 fan/gas mark 5 and heat for 2-3 mins to crisp up. Don’t leave them too long or they’ll dry out.
STORING DOUGH
You can keep the uncooked dough in a sealed container in the fridge for up to two weeks. Simply take some out, dollop on a lined baking tray and allow to come up to room temperature for 5 mins before baking

There's a lot of simple and complex mechanics alike which I've yet to fully explore. I'd expect even after reaching 1000 hours there are still things to learn from playing this game. 

Absolute timeless masterpiece 10/10 would recommend to pretty much anyone.

Also fuck Alexander lol"

1052,"This game runs smoothly and includes hours of fun, strategy, and replay value."
1053,"Good game, it feels more like a game about war than the other ones, and the actual civilization part of the game is a bit boring compared to the other games. I'd give it a decent 7/10 in terms of civilization games."

1071,yes
1072,very good would recommend
1073,"I used to play this game with my little brother and we'd try to survive in a world with raging barbarians while also trying to outpace the AI for the wonders. These memories are some of the most precious I have. From him yelling at me that he's surrounded and needs money. To me 'giving' him the great library so he had a chance to survive the AI. I will always look back to this game, and think to myself it was one of, if not, the best strategy game ever made."
1074,"Civ5 is single handily the best Civ out of all of them. It has complexity but isn't too overbearing, there is a diverse set of nations and [i]most[/i] of them are fairly balanced. If you are having a rough time getting into Civ6, then try this one because it is so much simpler"
1075,I liked it
1076,"It does drain life if you want to play it fully. I imagine people who play this game as people that like to garden. They start a project, get halfway through, get what they want and kinda abandon it afterward. Civ is a great game that I like to come back to time and time again to try different civ's and try new tactics. would recommend. It does take some time to get to know what youre doing, but (word of advice) follow the economic advisor and you'll get the gist on how to win!"
1077,Very Fun
1078,"One of the most well designed games, and extremely fun! But BIG WARNING, between the garbage AI and the very unstable multiplayer, you really have no one to play it with..."

1088,Great game!
1089,FUN!!!!!!!!!!!
1090,Just a fun way to kill time.  I like that it is a thinking persons game not fast action shoot em up.
1091,"I could talk baout this game for hours! Where do i even begin? Well, i suppose i will start with the obvious-- The McDonald’s McRib is a perfectly mediocre sandwich wrapped in an intoxicating aura of rarity and mystique. Is it as good as the legends say? Of course not. It’s a mystery meat sandwich encased in pungent barbecue ooze. But ultimately, it’s as hard to separate the McRib’s mythical status as it is to remove the sauce stains that wound up everywhere.

McDonald’s brought the hard-to-find sandwich back to menus this week, so get ready to hear a lot of opinions that you don’t care about -- kind of like the Spotify Year In Review in sandwich form.

McDonald’s McRib

The McRib is your vagrant and capricious uncle who you only see once every few years. Sure, he’s a little weird, but you love Uncle McRib. Everything’s fun when he’s around. You get to stay up late, eat ice cream for breakfast and apparently pour a bathtub full of barbecue sauce onto a sandwich.

But then you wake up the next day and there are tire marks from an ATV on your lawn, $100 in cable fees for boxing pay-per-views in your mail and sauce stains that you’re still cleaning up a month later.

The McRib works as a sort of Bigfoot of the fast food industry. It’s fun to think it’s out there and even chase after it. But what do you do once you find Bigfoot? You take a picture, move on with your day and then realize that it smells way worse than you realized it did.

So what does it taste like?

This sandwich has smell. It has so much smell.

Long before you ever get a chance to open the bag and examine the contents, the scent of the barbecue sauce is already working its way through every barrier between itself and your nose. No bag, box or mask will stop it. It’s like the cartoonish tendrils of scent that make Looney Tunes characters float up and get pulled toward the scent of a pie. Except in this instance, it’s a Kool-Aid Man full of barbecue sauce breaking through your car window and shooting you with a Super Soaker of tangy brown syrup-perfume.

In principle, the sandwich is fine. There’s a nice roll that’s soft and chewy. The pickles and onions add a nice contrast of flavor and texture. The pork patty tastes like pork, barely. Unfortunately, nothing in the sandwich is secure, slipping and sliding between the buns like the toppings on a poorly cooked pizza.

Everything about this sandwich is tied to the sauce. You don’t taste it as much as your tongue gets yelled at.

The “tangy” sauce has some good elements, but it hits way too hard to work with anything else. It’s like playing a marimba with a sledgehammer.

The actual “McRib” patty is a pressed patty of rib meat of questionable origin. It’s a little unnerving in how soft and loosely bound it is. The meat almost crumbles like hamburger as you chew. But it does taste like pork, carrying a nice meaty flavor once you manage to pick it out of the otherwise busy sandwich.

So is it any good?

This sandwich is a roller coaster. If you want to hop on for the ride of overbearing flavor that is the sauce, you might like it. Once that gets under control, there’s a solid-tasting pork patty in there with a couple of nice toppings and a bun.

If not, the McRib is going to take your taste buds through a miserable whirlwind of loops and corkscrews while your tongue hangs on for dear life.

The final word

There’s a good sandwich in here somewhere. But here’s the thing: I don’t think this should be a pork sandwich.

Listen, I shouldn’t have to tell you that the McRib is not a naturally occurring shape of meat. It’s like a chicken nugget. There’s more stuff happening to the meat than you probably want to know about.

So if it’s just going to get blasted with barbecue sauce and pork flavoring, why even use pork. There are plenty of meat substitutes that could work here. The McRib does not do a great job of copying the texture of actual pork. It’s way too loose and crumbly.

At this rate, McDonald’s should just partner with one of those faux-meat companies and start selling the McFib."

9/10"
1095,addicted to this game too much and love it
1096,"Absolutely not. This game is a goddamn narcotic. If you make the mistake of getting this came, you'll soon realize that you haven't slept or eaten in two weeks, and that you must absolutely play Just. One. More. Turn. before any of that matters. Seriously, don't destroy your life, this game should be on controlled substances lists."
1097,A true classic.
1098,incredible game
1099,This is a really good game when you're stuck at an airport

1107,Fuck Civ 6 all my homies play 5
1108,have u guys listened to the everything everything band? pretty good band in all honestly...... good game konami
1109,it's worth the price
1110,"I just have one thing to say about this game, it is amazing. I have not really played any of the Civilization franchise, but this game was really easy to get into. The tutorial really helped to get a basic idea of how this game is played and all the mechanics of it. 11 hours of my time have only got me through the tutorial and halfway through a large match with 10 AI. Really great game, 11/10 would recommend."
1111,eh its ok
1112,400 wasted hours that i don't even want back because i love this game
1113,It's good.
1114,"playing since it went out, probably missed many things in life playing this instead, was worth it."
1115,poop de scoop this shit is dope
1116,is good
1117,yes
1118,fun
1119,"I have played Civ 6 and Civ 5 both for over 500 hours, and after I got bored with Civ 6's AI, I gave another try to Civ 5's Vox Populi mod. And it's been a blast. Never experienced as smart AI in any games - of course not perfect but imo as close as you can get. Vanilla Civ 5 with DLCs is not close to VP. The mod just makes the game feel so realistic. You can roleplay your nation through the history."
1120,much better than civ 6
1121,pretty good
1122,"In my opinion, way better than Civilization VI and Humankind when you have mods like Vox Populi. Found this the most immersive 4X game so far."

1125,fire
1126,Its aight
1127,this game is funny funny

1135,"I've played Civ II-Civ VI and this is easily my favorite one. I really love the game play how the religions and social policies work. I like how it is pretty straight forward to learn, but the depth and strategy required to master the game takes time to develop and keeps me coming back."
1136,"so good

1139,I give one word Sid
1140,"Great way to think outside of the box
"
1141,"Worse than it's predecessor in almost every way possible, Civilization V is the arcady dumbed down crayon version of Civilization IV's masterpiece. Instead of a crescendo of industry and conquest, of a true trek through history, this feels like a Saturday cartoon version, a satire, of what Civilization is. The only good things about it are it's debate-ably better graphics, hexagons, and larger cities. Without mods, I cannot recommend this game."
1142,Just one more turn...
1143,Holds up.
1144,has always been one of my all time favorites 11/10.. masterpeace
1145,This is hands down the best game I have ever played. It works consistently with almost no issues and it is so addicting I can sit and play for hours on end.
1146,"My most favorite memory is stealing the Great Library from my friend who immediately alt f4's after the fact, when he's one turn away from getting it. Good times."
1147,its good
1148,Great game to get on sale with all the DLC. I have lost many hours of sleep playing this game and not realizing it's the next day.
1149,"I know it's hard to show growth of nations through the ages, but level of abstraction and simplification in this game is beyond me. It is a good time killer, but nothing more."
1150,a game of civilization... its awsome!!!
1151,I generally dont like games like this but I cant help but love Civ 5. Its a time burner but somehow still enveloping.
1152,good game
1153,goat
1154,Best game only because the two most subscribed mods are hitler and mussolini lmao
1155,"Still a great game, interesting scenarios, quite customizable map options, nation's specifics and a lot of other good things. Visuals are just a bit outdated, but no problem here. Music is nice.
But diplomacy with AI is not working well as for me, in tons of situations it is pretty clear what you want to achieve, but AI does not care or does not see reasons to react logically.
Another thing that is a big downside is a way of releasing a new CIV game: take old game, cut out most functionality, create barebones version, release it, then release actual fundamental functionality as DLC: religion, diplomacy etc. To be honest, it is a very bad practice.
All in all, Complete edition is still a great package now if you enjoy CIV and CIV-like games :)"
1156,"I've played this game for, at time of writing, 5,727 hours. I've gotten my monies worth...I think."
1157,Best game ever
1158,"Good fun great workshops to enjoy, relaxing and basically the civ game to end all civ games...at least until 7 comes out :P"
1159,Civ V is the Civiest Civ you can Civ it up with. 5 civs/5.
1160,Love it
1161,fuck i guess
1162,GOAT
1163,This is a really fun game. The controls are easy to learn and the art style is really cute. The cooking part can be infuriating sometimes but you get used to it. Very good survival game 11/10.
1164,cool
1165,"Civ V is a 4X game created by Firaxis, and this game is one of the best time sinks out there. Taking place on a world of the players choice, with a historical leader of that players choice. Civ V allows the player to create histories following their chosen paths. Sometime after learning the basic mechanics of the game by playing a game or two, you will have realized 300 hours have gone by. This game draws you with ideas of some relaxing fun, and and the cycle of ""just one more turn"" keeps you stuck to your chair. This game can be enjoyed in singleplayer, or even more so with friends.

"
1196,How can a history game not include Hitler. I think its completely absurd to remove a historical figure simply because controversial elements of his rule is popularized while several other included rulers are just as bad if not worse but simply committed crimes against humanity that are lesser known.
1197,"This was so good it was hard to try civ 6, but eventually it won me over. Game is still good today."
1198,"A classic, what else is more to say?"
1199,amazing
1200,"good game
would play one more move"
1201,The best game I've ever played. Don't hesitate to try this one; even if you're not a fan of strategy games.
1202,"If you like to ""build' you'll like it."
1203,great game
1204,good game
1205,fun
1206,Civ 5 is the best Civ I ever played
1207,Good sh**
1208,very good tactical game
1209,"Best of the Civilization game out of the series by my opinion. 
I have played over 2500 hours and still play when I can."
1210,"Rather lovely game. I wasted too much of my life on this but I am quite content about my decision. Much better than VI though the Giant Death Robot is way too bad in V compared to VI. Buy It, Play it, but do not expect a life from it."
1211,
1212,"the earth is flat

1213,Good classic only gets better with each new version
1214,simply awesome
1215,Ghandi fucked my wife 10/10
1216,cool game play it.
1217,🫵😵‍💫
1218,Its a fun game to play with historical features and war combat
1219,"fun game, i think the newer version is better if any one will start playing now tho"
1220,"Sid Meier's Civ, V fun to play, easy to understand and there are no problems with saves , starting or closing the game."
1221,One of the best time killers.
1222,better than civ 6
1223,I have 877 hours into this game. Idk if theres really anymore to say.
1224,"Absolutely insufferable online community. 90% of the time you will be kicked from lobbies for no reason other than the host just randomly decides he doesn't like you. And the few times you can play online, you're met with ridiculous rules that make the game boring, and are usually just so the host can win.

Not to mention, a majority of the servers are run by cringe nazi wannabes, who spend most of their turn writing the N word in chat because ""haha edgy."" 

Great game, terrible online"
1225,Evejn recommends🔓💜
1226,Fine wine classic that will never get old or be topped by its successors!
1227,Baby's first strategy game.
1228,BY FAR THE BEST CIV GAME FR CIV VI's art style is abhorrent they downgraded massively with the graphics
1229,"very good at consuming your time. W, is worth the money"
1230,Vox Populi gibi modpacklerle hala on numara
1231,it's okay
1232,"It is totally not a time-consuming game, Especially if you get into it, It will be quite fast-paced"
1233,"An enormous time vacuum. Highly addictive and prepare to lose sleep as you suffer the ""one more turn"" syndrome. Fantastic fun."
1234,I'd say it's pretty good.
1235,"I really liked how basic it is compared to later iterations. It's not super complicated and matches are super customizable, which is something that later games lack. Overall, it can be as easy or hard as you want it to be."
1236,wow
1237,its a really good game but since windows 11 its doesnt start anymore i hope this will change but in this state i can not recommend the game
1238,"This is the greatest  version of Civ, avoid 6 as is is thoroughly dull . I can no longer recommend this version as it will not play on  windows 11 (even with the legacy fix on steam)"
1239,"fun game to pass time and boost your knowledge on how to effectivly cooridinate strategies
"
1240,"Fun game, first CIV game i have ever played but its a great one! I have a urge to play this everyday
"
1241,Its pretty good.
1242,Pretty good
1243,LOVE THIS GD GAME
1244,"One of the best strategy games ever made. The game has got to be one of the most fun and addicting games ever made. It is easy to learn for people who are unfamiliar with this type of game but can still provide an adequate challenge as there are 8 difficulty levels to choose from. Doing multiplayer with your friends can be even more fun. The gameplay is very good and the fun factor is there. This is one of the first games I would recommend to anyone looking to get into turn-based strategy games or just strategy games in general. 10 out of 10, this game is flawless in my eyes.
"
1245,need more time to fully review but good so far
1246,Really good game.
1247,It's Civ-V...The World Is Yours.
1248,One of the best games out there
1249,game
1250,Over a decade of playing this game and still love every second of it.
1251,"I have played it for over 4300 hours...What more can I say ?
"
1252,"Yup, it’s still better than Civ 6."
1253,Great game
1254,Good stuff.
1255,"Bro, this game is so addictive. Even though I only played around 35 hours till now, I still remember when I first got it, I played 10 hours non-stop except eat or drink and my mind told me to stay away from this game lmao. I think this is still one of the best strategy game out there and you can truly enjoy it with any extra purchase of DLC. Great game! 
P.S. Can't believe Gandhi acts like that! LMAO!"
1256,"An awesome game to get absorbed in! 
Its one of the classic 4X games and its fantastic for anyone who would like a boardgame feel. Its not micromanage-y and its not overly complex but offers enough depth and choice of play to allow you to grow whichever way you would like. (Even though we all know tech domination is best!!)"
1257,Better than Civ VI
1258,fun time waster
1259,"not bad, need to play more to give full review"
1260,I have enjoyed this game off and on  for years. It can be very addictive and allows you to play in a number of different ways
1261,"Given that this is an ""older"" game and you probably didn't get here totally randomly, I'm going to go ahead and assume that you're familiar with the Civilizations franchise, or at least 4X (eXplore, eXpand, eXploit, eXterminate) games in general. Basically, you build cities, collect resources, research technologies, fight other players (computer or human), and try to win (science, culture, conquest, get elected world president, etc)

Why am I writing a review for a well known game that has been out for over a decade? For as long as I've had a Steam account, why is this only the second (I think) review I've written?

It just hit me that there may be another person like me out there,  looking for a quality time-waster for after they get off work. 

This one is almost perfect.

First off I have been playing video games for something like 38 years, and Civilizations games in specific for slightly over 30 years. Secondly, I am a super casual player, I have never really gone in for LAN or online multiplayer on these. The CIV games are my relaxation, almost my yoga; don't bring competitiveness into this.

My first experience was with the original Sid Meyer's Civilization in late 1991 at my buddy's house. I was a newly-minted 13-year-old, and I was almost immediately addicted. The first Civilization was the first game I ever pulled an all-nighter playing by myself (my buddy's dad found me still playing at like 9am, 5 or 6 hours after everyone else had gone to sleep... he said, ""Be careful with this one."" I think it got him, too.)

I never owned CIV 1; I only ever played it at by friend's house.

Woof. I was terrible. Basically no science, bad city placement, almost no expansion; I usually got wiped out by China or whoever when they attacked me with tanks. I kept trying to perfect my capital before I made a second city.

Whatever. 

I loved it.

I kept meaning to stop and go get some sleep, but my brain kept saying, ""Well... just this one more turn.""

I acquired a copy of Civ II when it came out for PC (I was rocking roughly 8MB RAM, a Pentium 75mhz processor, and like an 80MB hard drive), and I ended up playing the hell out of it (though I did drop most of the bells and whistles so it would run faster; I still love the ""advisors"" videos, though).

There are about 8,766 hours in a year, and it is almost certain that I've spent a full year's worth of hours playing Civilization games (it's possible I spent a full year just playing CIV II).

Anyways, those are my bona fides.

CIV II was, for a very long time, my favorite of the series. Eventually CIV III grew on me, but mostly due to me repeatedly playing games on the ""Marla Singer"" world map and trying to name all of the cities I founded (or took over) after real-world cities (or towns, or settlements, etc) in roughly the same place (the map was, by the nature of it being a 2D video game, kinda Mercator Projectionish, so I know way more about settlements in upper Canada and Siberia than I would otherwise; there is a TON of area to fill out on that map. Also there are a bunch of reasonable-sized cities, like Antofagasta, Chile, or Yekaterinburg, Russia that I really only know of due to this).

I will be honest that I do not like CIV IV very much. I don't know if it's something about the general aesthetic or the AI; I don't know if it's something about Corporations. It's my least favorite in the series.

CIV V, the first time (maybe the first couple of times) I played, I was really not a fan. So many changes to the core game mechanics. The shift to hex tiles, meaning spaces were now bordered by six other spaces (instead of 8 in the previous games, due to square tiles) seemed like an odd choice. The fact that you could no longer stack military units also rubbed me wrong. The fact that ""strategic resources"" were now based on quatity, as opposed to ""you eaither have it or you don't"" was similarly weird. The fact that different civilizations got VERY different bonuses (and building or units) was also weird to me in early games I played. All of these things make sense as you play, though.

Once again, I'm a person who plays these on ""Settler"" difficulty. I don't play against other people. I'm always hoping for that ""perfect"" start, where all my cities end up in ideal locations, and none of the computer controlled players build cities in just weirdly bad locations. I am generally a benevolent technocrat who refrains from attacking other CIVs until I feel like they're going to squeeze me out on resource tiles or something (or just found cities in terrible locations... seriously, who builds a city one tile away from the ocean? WTF is the point?). Whenever I start taking over an opponent's territory, I invariably immediately improve services and infrastructure (and I secretly feel bad for the damage I did while taking the cities over). I almost wish I could instruct the computer players as to where they should be building, but that would take all the fun out.

Due to the differences between different CIVs, some of which even affect how certain types of tile are used (some of them make forests useful), I find this iteration of the CIV franchise to have almost endless replayability in and of itself. But that's not all. There is a wonderfully deep Modding community who have taken it upon themselves to flesh out innumerable real-world civilizations (there're like three really playable versions of the Bedouins, as a quick example) but also just a metric fuxton of fictional civilizations (I'm kinda partial to the Pawnee civilization from Parks & Rec, though they're arguably a little OP vs vanilla CIVs in early game; their unique unit is basically a scout for normal cost, but with double normal movement).

The Mod community is what really puts this game over the top. It already had solid replay value, but now that I can play as Leslie Knope and beat up on one of the great houses from Morrowind, I don't see me abandoning this game any time soon.

Ratings:

Graphics - They don't really matter for this type of game, as long as they don't look terrible. Up against things being published now, I'd give this a solid 4.5 - 5 out of 10. It's clearly not realistic, but it doesn't hurt your eyes to look at (which is arguably what matters)

AI - As mentioned, I almost always play on the lowest difficulty setting, so I'm not the best person to judge this. The AI on ""Settler"" difficulty is basically a 1 out of 10, but that's on purpose.

Multiplayer - I have no experience playing against other human players, but it's probably fine if you're into that kind of thing

Gameplay - It's turn-based, and if I had a nickel for every time I was going to save and quit, but ended up playing ""just one more turn"" for a couple of hours, I could probably buy Twitter. It can get a little tedious if you have a lot of cities, but that's par for the course in CIV games. 8 out of 10

Replay Value - 10 out of 10 (especially with Mods)

Fun - For me, it's a 10 out of 10 (your results may vary)

If you're like me and play this type of game mostly as a wind-down, it would be difficult to find a better one. 

tl/dr - Overall Rating: 10/10 (based on my type of play)"
1262,My favorite Civ game. Though I'm sad the mod that adds in Hitler's Germany got rid of the fully animated Hitler.
1263,My friends are only my friends until I get nukes
1264,"i failed history class because CIV taught me that Ghandi was a warmonger.

8/10"
1265,The best Civ
1266,"Interesting tactical changes from Civ4 and earlier, and adds to more balanced gameplay with nice expansion options."
1267,next turn button is the most attractive thing i've ever seen
1268,"I just like it. It's easy to understand, but it gets harder the longer the game progresses.  Strategize early."
1269,"""You fool I am the Civilization V Complete Edition."""
1270,gg
1271,help me
1272,It is the best version of civilization.
1273,yes
1274,ghandi please stop nuking me
1275,Great game - you can play this tactical game in your own pace and difficulty
1276,top game
1277,"I've played these games since Civ III, and this is far and away my favorite. I can sit back and relax or buckle down and micro-manage and enjoy either play style. My personal quinessential Civ experience."
1278,"Just one more turn before bedtime!,crikey it's 3am again! :D"
1279,the cities scream when you siege them
1280,Still better than VI
1281,Siiiiiiiiiiiiid
1282,I haven't even played Civ 6 that's how good this one is. Cheaper too lol.
1283,its good i guess man
1284,"Many people's favourite CIV, not mine though."
1285,it's just good. Nothing else needs to be added
1286,fun af
1287,"Very fun but just very time consuming. Definitely worth the play if you like strategy war and city building games and/or history. Very addictive, make sure you set alarms when playing. The game has some balance issues and performance issues though just a warning. On multiplayer it crashes very easily and it is imperative that the host does not leave the game. Rejoins are buggy too, it's better to just remake the game. Other than some technical difficulties it is an incredibly fun game."
1288,awesome
1289,.
1290,cool
1291,"I've played this game for over 1,000 hours spread between several friends' accounts and my own. This game slaps, obvs."
1292,!
1293,i mean
1294,"good game. Best Civ IMO
"
1295,i liked everything
1296,perfect game for turn based strategists ten out of ten
1297,One of the best games I've ever played. And probably the best of all the civ games
1298,Best civ game so far
1299,"Civilization? More like, CiviliSEJtion.
IYKYK"
1300,It's all you'll be thinking about for the next 3 days
1301,"its fun 
"
1302,"the pros are numerous and the tutorial is longer than many AAA game campaigns

the only con i've found is i need a mod to auto save + exit on timed intervals so I don't ****ing ruin my life (41.9 hours played... in a 48 hour time span... pls help)"
1303,"A classic, it does not come with as many MODs as 4 and there are less features to control than in 4 or 6, but for me that makes it easier to concentrate on what we all play CIV for: WORLD CONQUEST"
1304,Civ V is a wonderful game. It's so easy to veg out and just have a blast playing it.
1305,"Do I have to say anything? This is civ, this is legenary...
"
1306,"its a very cool game 

its like the board game Catan"
1307,Thank you William.
1308,Good.
1309,good game
1310,If your friends get Nukes and start voting to ban nukes.. get ready to be nuked.
1311,"Everyone in highschool called me a loser

They were right"
1312,Played civ for most of my life and I don't consider it wasted time
1313,Its good
1314,ehhhh it's ok
1315,"best game i have ever played amazing
"
1316,good game
1317,It's OK.  Haven't played it enough to know if I really like it yet.
1318,"Hm avoid playing this game alone, or it will get super boring after a few games.
It is a shame that the developers didn't even bother to create an ingame map/scenario editor, you have to dig through an obscure section of your steam library to find it (Tools). And even then the scenarii don't work half the time. What a waste of potential when players could have make use of their creativity to built incredible maps themselves.

Other than that: ✓"
1319,Really disappointed to no longer be able to crossplay.
1320,Love this game
1321,best purchase i ever made
1322,A Civilization of my favourite art style.
1323,"Great game with endless fun and possibilities. If you want to unlock this games true hidden potential, think about getting all the DLC's & Lekmod / NQ mod"
1324,best civ game out there
1325,"The reason I made a steam account. Incredible game, replay value forever."
1326,"What can I say, 1800 hours and I am still excited like a little kid before opening christmas gifts when I start a new game...An epic game that I will always play and enjoy."
1327,"The best Civilization game out there if you get all of the dlc with the game. I cant recommend this game enough for strategy game enjoyers who likes civilization building. Its not overcomplicated and its just right. Anyone can get into the game and with a few games of learning be able to understand it easily. For how old the game is it holds up really well to standards today imo. 

:) smiley face"
1328,"Always come back to the game for a chill game, great content"
1329,do this instead of studying...trust me
1330,Good
1331,pretty good
1332,"great game, 10/10"
1333,Great Game!
1334,"Excellent game. Definitely one of my all-time favorites. It may have a few flaws - personally, its biggest flaw is that the game feels a little too grindy towards the later eras. At the start of the game, every decision you make has far-reaching consequences into the late game, but once you're in the late game, things feel less important. Also, winning conditions should have been a bit more streamlined - I don't know how many people out there like to do domination victories, but personally, I really don't like doing that one cause I don't really find it all that entertaining manually moving 50 units across the entire map to capture other players. That's just me though. Far prefer to do scientific or cultural."
1335,Great game.
1336,"Great game.  Would recommend if you just want to get lost for a few hours.  For the best experience, get Brave New World (100% worth it)."
1337,great game
1338,Miss this game; even better than 6.
1339,"Sin duda es un juego adictivo, no cabe duda que la complejidad es magistral, horas y horas de diversión (tensión) tratando de ser cada vez mejor y son la cantidad de variables lo que hace el juego uno de los mejores en toda la existencia"
1340,Dis game is pretty good
1341,"Been playing since Civ I.  This game is well known to me, and playing it is a form of meditation."
1342,"Love it !!!!
"
1343,"Addictive as all Sid Meier games, Civ V my favorite by far"
1344,Good game. Be careful of Gandhi though. He might nuke you.
1345,"Gameplay is fun, the game's well thought out and very much in touch with history. Game's reasonably educational, it's just good all round really."
1346,A very good strategy game that is quite challenging.
1347,bad
1348,Awesome game and a great game in the series...i like that it transcends time and its so in depth and you can actually learn some things if you read... and it can be walked away from for days and can still be picked right back up and continued.  great game!!  now wheres the tablet version???
1349,E
1350,"very bad design choices that break the fundamentals of the game
especially removing commerce,city maintenance 
and 1unit per tile which just causes endless traffic jams and micro hell without actually improving combat

civ4 is infinitely better play that instead"
1351,"A Classic, still like it better than Six."
1352,Good
1353,Amazing Game. Best way to spend a weekend at a time
1354,"This is my first Civilization game, and I had a lot of fun."
1355,yes
1356,"while it is a long strategic game, it offers several options to create a new experience each time"
1357,good game :)
1358,"I absolutely love this game and would Highly recommend to anyone who likes Risk, Axis and Allies, or world domination strategy"
1359,Nice
1360,good game.
1361,"Solid 4X and great entry into the Civ franchise. The swap to hex-grid and 1 unit per tile fixed the worst aspect of Civ IV. 

Civ V does lean very much towards a tall-style empire (4-cities + Tradition being the strongest combination), so if like me, you prefer large, sprawling empires, you're in for a rough time. This does, however, result in consistency. It's pretty easy to spot what is good and what doesn't work. The game has enough depth to stay interesting, but not too much to get overwhelmed by. 

It does suffer from the base game being weak, and essentially [i]needing[/i] both Gods and Kings and Brave New World to be good. Additionally, higher difficulties don't give you a harder opponent, but the same dumb AI with extra bonuses and cheats. Both of these things are inherent through the Civ franchise though, so can't be held against V too specifically.

Personally, Civ VI is the best in series, but Civ V is the ideal entry point to start playing."
1362,A timeless game that can stand the test of time.
1363,"Step by step strategy game about humanity, its people and their stories that you develope by playing it. Frome bronze to space age and even further."
1364,"Just 1 more turn you say.
Than I will do my homework or go to sleep...
50 turns later...
Nuke goes BOOOM
50 more turns goes by...
Man is it morning already???
"
1365,gud gaem
1366,"Played a lot
Still noob
100% worth it

100% will play again
100% recommended"
1367,","
1368,It's pretty good. Has some replayability
1369,good game
1370,"Okay so basically he waits until he discovers gun powder. So, when u see that hes building musket men just send a swordsman into the panama canal and click fortify. The look on his face will be priceless. He's gonna blow all his gold to kill 1 unit while you sit back and make more maois. It is full proof. JAJAJAJAJAJa"
1371,I keep forgetting to turn time victory off
1372,very yes
1373,"My favorite Turn-Based Strategy of all time, and my 3rd favorite Strategy of all time after Starcraft and Starcraft 2. 

~200 hours spent so far. 

Still better than Civ 6. 

100% Recommend.

For learning to play, I'd suggest FilthyRobot's youtube playlist of Guides Tips and Tricks videos."
1374,fun i guess?
1375,"Probably one of the best games I own. So incredibly fun to play. Kind of hard to pick up after a long break, though, so I recommend playing with some of the shorter/faster settings on if you want to finish a game. Also highly recommend playing in co-op mode with a friend; I don't see as many people doing that, but it's a blast."
1376,"This game is immortal. Its replayability hasn't faltered, 7 years and counting."
1377,The simplest strategy game
1378,Yep
1379,"Civ IV, Civ V brave new world, best turn game, any Civ game, love this game!"
1380,Amazing game with so many mods that can keep the game interesting!
1381,"no
"
1382,neat
1383,Classic. Possibly the best civ game
1384,Very GOod
1385,fun
1386,Love this game!
1387,Fun
1388,Meh couldnt get into it
1389,"I've loved Civ since I was a kid when my pawpaw showed me civ 3. Although it isn't my favorite game series, it will always have a special place in my heart and I will always love to come back to these games. I have civ 6 on my Nintendo Switch with hundreds of hours upon it, and Civ 5 does not disappoint. I love the more realistic leader models (compared to civ 6) and the more dry color pallet (again compared to civ 6). Although I have more hours on Civ 6 for now I 100% see myself having the same if not double the hours very soon."
1390,Better than Civ6
1391,Fun game but doesn't have Canada 5/10
1392,A Classic Game!
1393,I got the complete bundle during a sale. Really fun and easy to learn! First Civ game I've played and I greatly enjoy it.
1394,this game is good. without the DLC it is not so good. you should play this game
1395,based game
1396,I'll write this game review after just one more turn....
1397,It's much better and easier to understand than Civ. V!
1398,"I would recommend this game, but the bug where the workers stop every turn after being attacked by enemies is irritating. As such, you should consider this game only worth buying along with one of the expansions. I, myself, have bought Brave New World and have enjoyed the game MUCH more as a result."
1399,Very new-player friendly. Good for players that like to play the peace route and war route.
1400,I should probably buy the Dlc's
1401,Best Civ game I've played. What else to say?
1402,yes
1403,Just.. one... more.. turn
1404,Gandhi nuked me 10/10
1405,Its a good strategic time waster.
1406,I enjoy the directness and simplicity of the presentation and game-play of this version over the more complexified versions that come later
1407,Its a great game and very fun.
1408,W game ngl
1409,I've reinstalled this since Civ 6 is such garbage. It's still a good game however some of the advances of 6 make it seem a little dated.
1410,"Fun, addictive."
1411,"play this game
"
1412,"Civ will forever hold a spot dear to my heart , an enjoyable game"
1413,"The Base game is really nice, the game also truly shows who you are. if you have a grudge againts a nation which expanded to luxury resources first and you declare war on them when you have a bigger army then them(You can know this through the military advisor) and you also have a stable economy and a good amount of happiness, and oh! dont forget to research math as you need that court house with you! back to topic, it shows that you just declared a resource war and are a gready person.

-which is not a bad thing as you are doing it in a simulation, and you can also call me this oppresive and imperialistic gready person(as most of my wars i have declared on empires were for them having access to iron/uranium/oil)


i also plan on buying new world so i will be possibly be giving a new review when i buy it(idk if steam lets you put another review but ill see for myself)"
1414,"One of the best strategy game ever, highly recommend!"
1415,"I played civ5 for the first time years ago (this review 06.2022), so I've got civ6 and just couldn't get in to it, felt like running with tied up legs and  I gave up, then installed civ5 and my god I can run again. But that is just me and my opinion, some people really enjoy civ6 . Maybe there is something in civ6 settings but the first thing that really annoyed me was that the settler just couldn't build a city where I wanted to, but only places the map allows me to, that for me was no, no. I think that was the main issue for me, that the map is limiting me, meaning I want platform to build upon, It could be an empty rock for all I care. Some might say limits boost your creativity, maybe I'm not that creative, but I know one thing for sure I just wanna play the game and civ5  allows me to. And lets not forget mods from steam workshop."
1416,The complete edition is the best Civ ever
1417,over 500 hours and i still dont know what to do but its fun
1418,"Its great, if you like deep mechanics and turn based action."
1419,It's CIV 5
1420,"Do You want to dominate the world in as little consequence as possible? Is ""A Little Like Genghis Khan"" your theme song? Then do I have the game for you!"
1421,"This is a game for people who love going on r/pcm and cannot find partners because they have to say ""I am actually very interested by history."" It's not a fucking special interest you little goblin. Go play turn based RTS where that one dude from mongolia says ""I see the vermin are breeding."""

1429,I LOVE THIS GAME
1430,Amazing and timeless strategy game.
1431,"It's a game with depth and can teach you something about history and technological developments. It's a game you win by using methodology, skill and planning.  It's very fun in the beginning because you get to explore.  Some of the repeated sound effects are annoying."
1432,"This game with friends is one of my favorite games of all time, but with strangers turns into a hellscape of who can speed run the game the best."

1436,GOOD
1437,It's nice
1438,One of great game which can kill your time
1439,Nice addition to the Civilization franchise. I like the introduction of social policies and all the different options for specializing your civ. The new combat system is a real game changer too. The one unit per tile limit is annoying at times.
1440,"The 324 hours (at time of writing this) I have on this game is about equal to about 36 matches. One match, specially if you turn off the turn limit, can last about 6-10 hours if you play with real people. 

It's honestly one of the better history theme turn based strategy games out there but personally don't feel it's worth the full price due to basically needing all the dlc to get the full experience. Best to get this on sale.

For those who wondering the difference between Civ 6 and Civ 5, there's 2 key non gameplay differences.

One, Civ 6 is currently using their own launcher from 2K and since they added it, it has caused performance issues, crashes, and overall ton of people can't even launch the game. For that reason alone, you will find Civ 5 has a larger player base as Civ 6 for almost $100 USD for all its DLC + base game, people can't play it.

Two, Civ 5 has a way larger mod community and player base. Part of the reason is because of the first reason but also because the games been out longer and is more easy to mod from what I understand. That and from what I seen, most of the Civ 6 mods that are downloaded are UI ones because the UI from Civ 6 apparently is very bad. Civ 5's isn't that good of a UI either on some fronts but holy shit, they some how made it worse.

For those wondering why I just review Civ 6 and downvote review it, I don't own it. I'm smart enough to see everyone else's issues and this should hopefully get some eyes and convince people to go for Civ 5 over Civ 6. It's just a better overall and addicting if you love turn based games."
1441,upades make this game unplayable. Crashes constantly.
1442,This is the classic Civ game! It is fully enjoyable and a great time with friends! The game play can be slow at times but it can quickly shift and speed up drastically. The only downside is you need a fairly powerful PC to play the game at max settings.
1443,It is a fun game. But if you don't already have Civ 6 get that instead
1444,Love this game! Has lots of great options & the user interface is very friendly. Can't recommend enough!
1445,"Amazing waste of time
"
1446,great game
1447,nice
1448,"If Sim City met Risk. Though it may be a bit dated now it's still a decent game and part of a classic series. Great with friends, Fine alone too if you enjoy solo more, AI's are a little indecisive but you can't expect perfection from something that's this flexible. There's not a ton of bugs you can experience if any at all outside of cosmetic issues every now and then that go away by next turn. (Or atleast in my experience.) Easily a game one could put multiple hundreds of hours if not thousands into with the right friends."
1449,"Good game, but the expansions are pretty much mandatory.

I prefer Civ VI and Humankind, but there are plenty of people for whom Civ V is the favorite, and that's a perfectly understandable opinion. It strikes a good balance between complexity and abstraction, looks nice, and has a great soundtrack.

My biggest complaint is that individual cities only take up one tile and armies take up many tiles. This design choice affects many aspects of city planning and battles in IMO a negative way. Even so, the game is still fun. This issue I have with it is a matter of personal preference and is not at all game-breaking."

I've tried Civilization 6 as well, but didn't enjoy it as much. That's probably personal preference though, and I do admit that this game is starting to age and show it's rough edges, and isnt as polished as civ 6. 

All in all, I sincerely do recommend getting this game, but not for the 30 dollar price tag steam currently sells it for. Get in on sale or online and you're in for loads of fun :)"
1465,one of a kind

Definitely recommend this game. This game is also a great game to pass time too, and single player is very fun if no one is online either. This will go down in history as one of the best CIV games out there. Also CIV 6 is garbage so don't waste your time or money.

The only thing I dislike is on DEITY mode, almost everyone declares war on you for no apparent reason. I even had a city state declare war for no reason and I gave them hella resources too."

1500,"i review games on steam after i 100% complete them! check out my reviews to see all the games i have completed!
 
when i first bought a gaming pc, i was looking for games on sale to buy and the very first thing i saw on the steam store was that you could get civ v + all the dlc (normally well over $120) for about $12, and ever since then i've been sold on pc/steam gaming. civ v is one of the first games i bought on steam, and to this day it is still one of my favorites. it balances depth and complexity with accessibility for newer players. the amount of unique civs, all with their own unique units and bonuses, as well with the many different types of map sizes/shapes, really gives all civ games basically unlimited replayability. i recently finished getting all 286 achievements yet i still could put in many more hours in this game if it weren't for me recently buying civ 6 in anticipation of me completing this.

TLDR: this game is incredible for many different reasons. if you have even the tiniest amount of interest in strategy games and don't know where to start, civ v is a perfect introduction."

Played almost 70 hours of it prior to the new launcher without a single issue. Post update on the new launcher, nothing but errors and issues. Avoid.

Edit - And since then have been banned from the discussion thread for mentioning a single word - not advocating it, just mentioning it. Will never touch a 2K Game again."

1538,"Awesome game, although Brave New World expansion is necessary. The game can be entertaining for a very long time. My only complaint is with the AI. Overall, it is functional, but it really should be overhauled, since it often handles combat poorly, allowing you to overcome much larger armies simply because the AI doesn't understand how to position its units. In addition, the AI's stupidity makes the difficulty setting in the game very tedious at very high levels, since it simply receives larger starting bonuses rather than being just more strategic or dangerous. These bonuses tend to make harder difficulty runs tedious, since the game often ends up turning into a procedure (there are things you simply always have to do or rush to stay competitive), which restricts the strategic freedom you have by turning winning the game game into a relatively inflexible procedure."

1556,"After achieving my first victory (domination) as Suleiman, I think its a good milestone to write my review for this game. Like a lot of my games this review will be someone short until I play more of the game in which I will add to it and it will become long (just look at my hoi4 review for example.) Anyways, so far this game is great, I don't know any other game where you can play as one nation that lasts pretty much the entire time humans have existed. (unless you count Paradox mega campaigns but thats 6 games with converter mods.), And it's so fun to watch time progress as your units and buildings get better and better and more and more modern and refined. I also think the countries all having unique abilities makes the game a lot better as it increases the replayability, especially with specific countried being tailored toward the different kinds of victory such as korea being a scientific powerhouse. Now before you say I have no place reviewing this game so early, I will come back and write a new review once i have played now but for now I have played one domination victory as Suleiman, two defeats as Napoleon and Genghis Khan, and I'm on track to a cultural victory as Korea. I love this game. Go buy it even for the full $50 it is for the complete edition (i got)"

1576,it is really fun.
1577,"Civilization V is probably my favorite game of all time. 
It's the one game I keep coming back to, that never gets old (which is ironic considering it's a game about progressing though the ages and leaving the old behind). No matter what strategy I feel like employing, I know I'll have a great time, no matter what civ I choose (except maybe Portugal, they really don't have much going for them).  
Whether I'm busy offloading my entire unused supply of iron to the belligerent AI, trying to sneak out a Culture win under the warring nations' noses, or coercing the World congress into accepting 'Catgirls' as the World Religion, I'm always enjoying myself. 
Civ V is the definition of a chill game, where you can just jump straight in and play, turn by turn, oftentimes right into the wee hours of the night. Then it also allows you to sit around micro-managing your cities' output to your heart's content, which i vigorously partake in, only to lose my mind as the production progress bar for my Workshop ticks over to 119,5/120, since I ofc forgot to account for the Golden age boost ending...

10/10 would play Spain and discover El Dorado right next to my capital again."

There are some bugs and quirks that can be exploited to get quite the big advantage and it adds up: (stealing multiple eraly worker from a city state without making peace, getting production when citizens are born by always having production focus an locking food tiles, unable to starve when building settlers so lock production etc).

It definitely has a bit of a steep learning curve but once youve learned it this game basically has infinite replayability. Probably the best and most iconic Civilization building game ever made. The graphics definitely show some age but honestly its not even that bad. Plus you can run it even on an absolute potato.

Well worth the asking price, even for an old game. I highly recommend picking up the DLC as well for the full experience (at least get brave new world). The best Civ game by far."

1620,"What could I possibly put into this review that hasn't been said dozens if not hundreds of times by others?

Civilization is such a known entity, and yet there may be someone reading this that isn't familiar; someone that doesn't have a good understanding of what the series is about. If that's so...this review probably isn't the right place to go for answers. Plenty of sites have better material to provide a synopsis, an overview of mechanics, and so on. For the purposes of my review, this is coming from a long time fan of Civilization.

And I have to say...Civilization V is a masterpiece. I'd slept on this entry in the series for a long time -- I'm rather change-averse, and learning and understanding the changes in each new title is its own ordeal. How I wish I had moved on to Civilization V sooner.

So many much-needed overhauls. Revisions and adjustments to things I hadn't even realized I wanted fixed. Massively easier city management. Much better-handled AI negotiations and trade. Civilization V feels like it streamlines everything that should be streamlined, while still giving you absolute control over all the aspects that provide meaningful choice and options. The change to a hex map is massive, and warfare has never felt better. Individual Civilization abilities and units feel influential without being cumbersome (though some are certainly better than others), and the changes to how religion works are amazing.

If any Civilization fans out there (or 4X fans in general) still haven't tried Civ V, it comes with my highest recommendation as far as the genre is concerned."

The escalation in technology is really detailed and well constructed, it actually makes you feel the progress of humanity.
I recomed this game 100%"
1682,"Fun and addicting, especially with a friend group
"
1683,zSdvSDsQGSASWQcvsadafeasgseawwaGEWFWEGFASEdaw words cant describe ow much i like that game
1684,fantastic well worth the money
1685,"Civ V is ""peak civ"".

Or perhaps its successor Civilization: Beyond Earth is? IDK
Either way, with the release of Old World from Mohawk, 4X is stepping back in time. Civ V is retro as hell.
If like me you like scenarios and maps, then Civ V is vastly superior to Firaxis' followup Civ VI. Scenarios Into The Renaissance and Scramble For Africa are sublime.

As for MP, Beyond Earth and Civ VI are better games. But the single player experience in Civ V considerably more challenging.

Civ V honed the addictive ""One More Turn"" game play. Civ VI not so much."
1686,"Still one of the best strategy games out there.
One small gripe would be there are certain items that completely crash the game (great walls and scout are the two that have crashed mine so far)
Aside from that - 9/10"
1687,"fun game, a classic if you will."
1688,"Very Poggers much fun, happiness doodoo"
1689,accidentally played 20 hours straight + ghandi
1690,yes
1691,"Love it, but it will eat up your time lol
"
1692,"Great game, will however suck up all of your time. I am definitely an old man yelling at the clouds with this, but I really love the graphics of this edition of Civ as compared to the new one. I won't digress too far into this however, TLDR; great game, love it, would recommend."
1693,Very chill pass time
1694,I love this game! Wonderful complexity. A must if you enjoy strategy games.
1695,Dope.
1696,""" We want you to stop expanding so close to our borders.""
"" Okay, sorry, won't happen again.""
*Deploys 5 more settlers*"
1697,best RTS out there.
1698,"  This game seems more expansive than Civ 6, and I think it's because Civ 6 is made for apple Ipad's limited memory."
1699,Excellent game for playing on your own or with friends
1700,CIV V is a great strategy game that I enjoy trying to master.
1701,"much hours, some fun, beware english."
1702,It's Civ 5
1703,Kinda fun game to play...
1704,Very Happy
1705,There are endless ways to enjoy this game with challenging complexity. I've put in countless hours and still have so much to learn and try in this game.
1706,"great
"
1707,great game!
1708,Still better than Civ VI
1709,"I lost many more than I won which is only one, ""the space race"""
1710,It is a fun game
1711,2
1712,i still havent finished a game 10 out of 10
1713,"I've genuinely spent so much time playing this game over the years on other accounts etc and with friends. 

It's a fun game it can be annoying with the spawns but its purely rng the spawns. The game is more fun to play with friends then it is solo.

100% worth the money you spend on this game for countless fun and annoying times

10/10 would recommend even if new to this genre"
1714,"Great game if you like (micro)managing stuff and want to live out a powerful ruler power fantasy. Be aware though: You will lose yourself in it and won't recognize how fast the time passes. One more turn syndrome goes hard with civ.
Game aged like fine wine."
1715,"You tell yourself you will put the game down once this turn wraps up. 

Then the nation next to you attacks."
1716,Can 2K stop making that stupid launcher?
1717,fun to play
1718,","
1719,"Timeless, great game to play with friends"
1720,can never go wrong with a good campaign when you are to lazy to do anything
1721,trust no one
1722,Nuclear Ghandi.
1723,good fun
1724,one more turn
1725,good
1726,GOAT game
1727,"Great game I still need to learn to play on higher difficulties. So good that I bought the sixth game with all dlcs on sale and realised after a few hours that I will never play the sixth game because this one is superior. So I deleted the sixth game from my account with no regrets.
For me CIV 5 is a great addition to my Anno 1404 Venice addiction of chilling strategy games that I can play a very long time.
I think I will return to play CIV 5 for a few hours for years to come.
I would love to pay for a remastered version with new graphics but keep the gameplay!"
1728,"My ""friend"" destroys me right before I get my Nuke every single time"
1729,So many good mods with excellent mechanics.
1730,Game has great renderings and good choises.
1731,Great game to play alone or  with friends!
1732,it's good but you need to get brave new world expansion to get the real game
1733,"Just finished my first game.  Will ruin your life, but it's okay, since it becomes your life."
1734,it's a good game
1735,My favorite of all civilization versions
1736,Decent
1737,"Civilization V se inicial bien el juego, al poco tiempo se bloquea la imagen y luego se queda negra la pantalla, teniendo que apagar el ordenador e iniciar de nuevo"
1738,"I don't know why I keep coming back to this game again, and again. Granted, Civilization VI has better game play and game mechanics, but it wouldn't come close to the music, ambience, the graphics, the realism of the game and the leaders, to me at least. I keep finding myself immersed in the music and the game, whenever I play African or Asian Civilizations like Egypt, Arabia, Assyria, Siam and Korea, like I am one of those great leaders, leading, building a Civilization that stands the test of time.

P.S. My first gameplay was Egypt, back in 2013 or 14, and I lost that steam account. Years later, I find it still nostalgic. Hoping Civilization VII would expand upon this"
1739,"A replayable classic. Never experience the same game twice, for the possibilities are endless. The geometrical progression of this game allows even new players to grasp the concepts quickly, something that strategy games often struggle with. Do yourself a favor, take plenty of breaks. This is an addictive game."
1740,A really good civ game. Does exactly as you would expect and is super addictive.
1741,Good game
1742,peepee poopoo
1743,"My Empire is growing in size, power, strongest economy and won 3 wars against neighbors *Doesn't have salt* entire population rebels destroying my empire because no fucking salt to make them happy"
1744,"Ghandi nuked everyone
9/10 would recommend"
1745,"Great game, always loved it"
1746,"i have over 1000 hours in this game, I love it"
1747,good
1748,10/10
1749,"Pogramp
"
1750,nice game bozo
1751,BEST GAME EVER MADE
1752,Nice fun
1753,Just one more turn...
1754,"World Peace? and Nukes?? and Ghandi???
Good game.
I would play for just another round any time... only to find 10 hours passed... and its morning...
Play this game."
1755,always love these games
1756,"This game continues to be one of my favorite turn-based strategy games. As video game graphics improve and I move onto Grand Strategy games made by Paradox, this is one of the few games I regularly return to. Its relatively simple systems belie the true complexity of the gameplay. When you first start playing it may seem like you have little control over the fate of your civilization, but when you begin to understand and master the mechanics you'll find yourself looking back and seeing how primitive your initial gameplay really was.

I would suggest waiting for a sale and grabbing the base game and all DLC. Civilization 5 became the incredible game it is after the DLC filled out the gameplay mechanics, it's not worth playing without them at this point. This is worth your time even if no one else you know is still playing it. Enjoy!"
1757,great in depth turn based strategy game.
1758,"Played this game for years, always an enjoyment, though the mid game can be a bit dull at times. There's ALOT of achievements, so for those achievement hunters out there here is a challenge and a half"
1759,a
1760,I love nuclear genocide
1761,Civ V is a veritable staple in 4X strategy games. Worthwhile singleplayer or multiplayer.
1762,fun game !!!! love the exploration and  stuff lol
1763,can't run the game anymore
1764,dont leave
1765,It's a pretty fun strategy game with interesting characters and set ups. You get what you ask for and basically it's like a fancy version of risk.
1766,still the best role playing strategy game
1767,Its a fun game for the short amount of time i played it. just.....one....more.......turn.......@_@
1768,Gandhi has a control of the world by the pacifism
1769,Very nice game
1770,"Crashes on Win10.
Cannot start game."
1771,"Seemed to be a perfect balance between conquering, building, advancement and side events.  Got a little annoying though with all the opposing missionaries and prophets changing things..."
1772,Best game I've ever played.
1773,Better than Civ 6!
1774,"If you dislike games where you have to spend more than 2 hours on a playthrough this game is nothing for you. 

But if you like strategic games, like age of empires, but you're also searching for something that's more elaborate than that game, this game is definitely the pick for you. I guess you could see this game as a more elaborate version of the boardgame Catan. 
 
I will say that in my experience this game is a lot better when you've bought the dlc's, so if you're planning on buying this game I definitely recommend you buy the dlc's as well. 

There's so much to learn in this game that you never actually get fed up with this game. I've spent many hours on this game and I do not regret any one of them. And even after +1000 I still discover new things in this game

My score for this game is a 10/10."
1775,Probably the best Sid Meier's Civilization games every.   Wish VI had more of what this has.
1776,it is fun
1777,respectable game
1778,"Just buy Civ 6. Now I can appreciate and understand why people prefer the serious approach pre-civ6 games had, it just doesn't hold up to standards. The UI is a joke and is like going back and playing old Paradox games. Not worth the trouble in 2022 honestly. CIV 6 improves majorly and in nearly every way possible."
1779,"Buy it
"
1780,Lots of fun
1781,One of the best games to betray friendships.
1782,Addiction.
1783,A game where you can conquer the known world... you just got to love it.
1784,awesome
1785,"First of all I need to note, this is my first civilization game, so this is from a “ newbie “ standpoint. I really liked this game, it was challenging and fun, especially in coop with friends, considering “ scenarios “ well, they can range from quite easy to painfully HARD( I`m looking at you Boers in “ Scramble for Africa “ on deity!! *poke* *poke* * POKE * ).
Also need to note some logical downsides like why archers evolve into gatling gun team and lose attack range and why if enemy attacks me and I defeat him, capture his cities and everyone scream “ bloodthirsty maniac! “ at me?!
Other than that, well, definitely worth played time.

P.S. I did not buy it on full price(summer sale, it was 15$), figured I need to note that.
"
1786,.
1787,My 1st match lasted 7 hours....
1788,best game of the series in my opinion
1789,Love it
1790,I am dogshit at this game. I will GLADLY play another 30+ hour game to wipe Sweden off the fucking map just for EVERYONE else to gang up on me like 1k+ years later.
1791,Yes.
1792,fun
1793,"I've played all Civ games over the years from the original through till Civ VI, each game has its quirks and dynamic. Civ V is no exception"
1794,It's very good. Buy it.
1795,Easy to start playing. Fun to play solo or in groups.  Many styles of play from warlike to peaceful trade and exploration.  Lots of things to master over time and still fun after countless games.
1796,"GREAT GAME, MULTIPLAYER KIND OF BUGGY"
1797,this gmae is too hard :(
1798,good shit
1799,"there are more than 5 civilizations, and none of them are named ""Sid Meier"""
1800,"GOOB GAYM
"
1801,"Terra Nova music is ingrained in my brain forever, as well as the BNW dlc intro. This game will always have a place in my heart. Nowadays MP is less easy cause its harder to justify spending 50 bucks on a game to your friends when Civ 5 is a generation behind in it's series, especially since they haven't played much strategy. But overall, this game is great.

Still stick to this game because Im not a fan of graphic changes from realism to cartoony and other slight gameplay tweaks in Civ 6."
1802,...
1803,"2K suck my pecker. Wanna play the game? Here, use this horrible launcher for no reason. Wanna play DLC with your friends? Spend an hour crying to get it working."
1804,Still a banger
1805,when you realize being a dictator is fun
1806,A solid civ game
1807,yes
1808,123.1 hours on my record and I honestly think I have another 1000 in before I'll get bored.
1809,good game
1810,"I've played 1080 hours... and that is ignoring all the hours I played when I pirated the game or offline.... So yeah... honestly, I am not even hardcore about it. I just like restarting and save scumming with Spain on a huge map until I get some awesome natural wonders that let me get early settlers and then I build as many wonders as I can before I buy all the city states loyalty and get voted to be the world leader on the first vote.... sometimes I get a culture victory. 

I tried most of the civs once or twice. And have won with every victory condition. Domination is dark man.... Like I just feel like the world is getting sadder as I remove civilizations from the map and have fewer and fewer neighbors to talk to.

Science is kind of fun but it takes longer than diplomatic or cultural.

Cultural is meh.

Diplomatic is boring.

So I guess buy it? It's a pretty chill time."
1811,Great improvement upon Civ 4. AI plays to win not to be a stumbling block and AI interactions are balanced.  Gameplay has diverse elements too to keep the strategy interesting.
1812,Fun
1813,"Great, addicting game!"
1814,asdfsdf
1815,better than 6
1816,eh
1817,This game has all you need for the rest of your life.
1818,GERMANY GERMANY GERMANY GERMANY GERMANY GERMANY GERMANY GERMANY GERMANY GERMANY GERMANY GERMANY GERMANY GERMANY GERMANY GERMANY GERMANY GERMANY GERMANY GERMANY GERMANY GERMANY GERMANY GERMANY GERMANY GERMANY GERMANY GERMANY GERMANY GERMANY GERMANY GERMANY GERMANY GERMANY GERMANY GERMANY GERMANY GERMANY GERMANY GERMANY GERMANY GERMANY GERMANY GERMANY GERMANY GERMANY GERMANY GERMANY GERMANY GERMANY GERMANY GERMANY GERMANY GERMANY GERMANY
1819,It do be good tho
1820,Yes play it
1821,better than a drug addiction
1822,I am the lord of this castle!
1823,Awesome strategy game.
1824,good and fun
1825,good video game .3 / 11
1826,"Probably the best Hexagon tile game out there. There are no words to describe the amount of replayability you can get from this game and its DLC. With each map for each game being randomly generated  (unless you play a pre-generated map like earth), you can get almost every game you play to feel different from the last. 

Also the best Civ game"
1827,good game... just expect the random crash
1828,"A real masterpiece. Basically a board game like catan but your computer does the calculations, which lets the game easily have way more complicated rules than a physical one and is a lot faster to play. This game also goes on sale really frequently, so wait til that happens and you can buy the whole game plus all DLC for like 20 bucks.
Only real issue with the game is that mods don't work on multiplayer."
1829,I like the wide range of playing options
1830,Addicting.
1831,yes
1832,I personally like this better than Civ 6. Solid game if you are a Civilization fan.
1833,noice :)
1834,I played from CIv 1 when i  was like 5 year old or whateva i didnt even knew english good as it wasnt my main so i thought king or warlord are good options for a difficulty...But i played civ 2 civ 3 and i even played civ IV on notebook whole summer when i was on holiday in turkey i just wake up go outside to get color and play civ IV :D now im downloading this game after like owning it for so long and i think it will be good experience.
1835,"old game, newer versions out."
1836,"Play for a while, build a nice little nation, get nuked by Gandhi"
1837,"started playing with  Civ 3 and continued through Civ 6.  didn't care for Colonization, but Civ is a series to play."
1838,Would you like a trade agreement with England?
1839,more than 1000 hour so yea good game
1840,Nuclear war is fun.
1841,"This game is amazing. It is, in my opinion, the best game in its series, and it definitely holds up a stick to civ 6
"
1842,liek very much
1843,"My Father and I used to play this game together at least two or three days a week, and we had an amazing time.  I've been playing for such a long time and never taken the opportunity to share my opinion, so I will now.  This is not a game, this is the ultimate experience.   I truly have never had a better and more enjoyable experience and still continue to play to this day.  It has continued to stand the test of time and I thank every Developer and/or Designer who put their time into creating such wonderful, beautiful and happy memories for me and my Family."
1844,Best game ever made you just make cannons for 5 hours and want to kill yourself
1845,It's like Risk but way better.
1846,cool
1847,"Very fun game, very replayable"
1848,The Great nuking of China 1800 B.C.E
1849,Nice turn game so you can continue games easily
1850,"The hours speak for itself. Great game! I have never to this day, played another game to the extent I have done with Civ 5."
1851,best round based strategy game I ever tried. got over 80 hrs ingame and NEVER even finished a match.
1852,I has new and challenging ways to enjoy the Civ series . You can play the game in different ways and have just as much fun with each differing style of game play.
1853,"""I like to travel a lot"", been to every country, island, land, and continent. Built 7 world wonders, robbed from camels, founded a religion, and conquered civilizations hbu?"
1854,OH YEA!
1855,"Great game, one of my favourites of all time. Civ 5 > Civ6"
1856,Ye
1857,mod the game
1858,"What's really to say? It's Civ. 
Build a civilization while fighting barbarians, braving elements and dealing with AI politics. 
Multi-player ought to be interesting, especially when it comes to looking for games to join and waiting for the others to get off their thumbs and finish their turns... 
You know, Civ...."
1859,"colton, please hop off civ 6. michael, the guy hanging out of the window was not a jumpscare."
1860,SIMPLY THE BEST!!!!!!!>>>>>>>BETTER THAN ALL THE REST!!!!!!!
1861,is gud game
1862,
1863,The best version of Civilization for me. I can't get into 6. This is so good.
1864,"fun game
DLCs are worth it"
1865,"Klassikko, oli versionumero mikä tahansa."
1866,a
1867,I enjoy the competitive nature of building a successful civalation
1868,"I have only played with the expansions, but this is one of my favorite Civ's so far! Mid-End game can be a bit tedious, but really worth it!"
1869,It's fun.
1870,it was pretty good. i made a religion called Jewdaism. the Juish people are strong believers in kindness and respect and accept allah as their lord and savior. barbarians kept sponning even though they should cost 5 elixir so it was kind of unrealistic unless they manage their elixir really well
1871,Hours of fun.
1872,"Just. One. More. Turn.

Only negative I would mention is that when you're clearly going to be winning, it takes maybe 20% of the game turns, but 80% of the play time to actually push to victory."
1873,Do not buy this game. Civ 6 looks way better and has better gameplay. Unless ofcourse you were born before 1955.
1874,Good game to kill time once in a while
1875,"just wanna let everyone know that I beat this on deity setting 6 civs, small, continents, quick pace.













its also a really good game thats worth playing even if, like me, you don't think you'd be into the genre"
1876,"Not enough Hats, 1/10"
1877,Absolutely fantastic!  I just love it.  Brave new world and all.
1878,"I am not sure how to rate it since I have only played 7 hours. Haven't finished one playthrough yet, but I will go a few more turns and get  back to you in 12 months when I finish this."
1879,"im deaf, I lovw it he"
1880,It's a cool game
1881,"Do you want to build up an empire? Do you want to try and take over the world through diplomatic means? Scientific efforts? Economic profits? Do you want to throw all of that in the garbage because your neighboring nation just declared war and you forgot to build an army, and now it's 5am, you have work tomorrow, but you own all of Africa and Asia, and the city-states of the world refuse to do business? 

This game will capture your attention. Put on a movie, be sure there's another movie - or two - after that, and go bananas. I have the base game & no expansions. I have 500+ hours in. I play casually. It's worth the price."
1882,blink and lose 8 hours + annex whole map + i don't care if they're unhappy i'm a dictator
1883,yes
1884,"Its civ 5 , with the brave new world expansion, kotaku said its great, ice t also said that."
1885,awesone
1886,"I am unable to even play the game. It crashes after the cinematic intro every time. I would expect better from an indie game, I would never expect this from a Civ game."
1887,One of the greatest time sinks you'll ever play.
1888, I have played it for years and it is still a lot of fun!
1889,This and Civilization III are the best in the series. I also bought Civilization VI but don't play it. This is probably personal taste. Hope you enjoy.
1890,"GREATEST GAME EVER
"
1891,"Amazing game, worth every penny"
1892,its gud
1893,"I play on easy and dominate every single game I play so I can finally live my reality of being a ruthless dictator 

10/10"
1894,Its grate
1895,"been playin civ 5 for a long while, its good 6 can go rot in the dreaded deadset hole it crawled out from"
1896,"Classic, more interesting then the real thing"
1897,the best Civ so far
1898,funny end turn or ill tear you stem to stern
1899,Great take on the classic game that I remember. Still fun to play.
1900,Best Civ.
1901,I like changing my city names to insult the Persians.
1902,Best  game ever played over 460 hours.  Never gets old mods are great
1903,This game will never get old. Civilization V will always be one of the greatest games of all time.
1904,Its amazing
1905,Good game keeps you engaged.
1906,love this game.  If i cant think of anything to play i can always rely on this game to entertain.
1907,Its the good civs game. Screw civs 6.
1908,It is fun with friends
1909,"My favourite version of Civ. Never got to grips with Civ VI.

"
1910," Replayable
"
1911,gud gaim
1912,I spent plenty of time in this game playing and playing. I loved that this is a great game for distracted play and for long term gaming.
1913,Get it. It is good.
1914,Great gameplay and strategy. Fascinating historical content. Lots of ways to play.
1915,okay
1916,Better than civ 6
1917,i like everything about this game
1918,Almost as good as paraplegic dwarf fart porn.
1919,It's okay.
1920,Its ass
1921,"Addicting, I like it better than VI"
1922,"Awesome, addictive, clever, always learning and challenging! I have uninstalled and re-installed this game so many times trying to fight the compulsion to play, get distracted from the ""garbage of the  day"" and it works. The pdf manual is well written, with sprinkles of humor for an informed start (but not necessary to read to play). If I can ever master this I will look forward to trying Civ VI but that could be another 5 years.  

Some part of the scoring is vague during game play - such as the value of Research Agreements.  My only other partial tedium is the characters of the opponents (computer AI) dont change and become predictable - yes they can be randomized but they are still the same personality with a different country.

In summary - excellent graphics, effects, gameplay and as a non gamer this is my go-to.

Aloha"
1923,Bread.
1924,it is awesome
1925,"great fun so many civs to play as and so many ways to interact with other civs. the only downside i have to this game is that the game can be a bit long that makes me wish that we could have a shorter version of this game like the xbox version civilisation revolution. however if you can get past the time and just play in lots of sessions then i would highly recommend this game.
"
1926,uhhh yep pretty good
1927,Fun game
1928,great game
1929,"One of my favourite games to this day, with all the DLC endless singleplayer fun, with mods can even be balanced better, wish there was a better online community"
1930,it's awesome
1931,once you learn the game controls this game is a hoot to play
1932,"i just love sucking george washingtans toeseys, hes just so sexy baka"
1933,One of the best turn based strategy games hands down. Amazingly engaging strategic gameplay.
1934,IYKYK
1935,.
1936,hi
1937,good
1938,Still the best civ ever made.
1939,The best one of them all.
1940,fun
1941,Best Civ ever!
1942,It's a very fun and engaging game. Love the turn based strategy style and love the graphics.
1943,
1944,I'm getting addicted with this game. I highly recommend this game.
1945,better than civ 6
1946,"it's like if you have two sisters. This one is your favorite sister. Civ VI is the sister you catch up with every now and then but try and avoid. CIv V sends you funny memes every day and you grow to genuinely enjoy their presence after years of childhood fighting. You realize what family means to you now. Civ V, my life would never be the same without you."
1947,"it's like the first lick of a juicy cock, always satisfying to start a new one :)"
1948,"gorilla
"
1949,super fun can play for hrs
1950,h
1951,"Awesome game. Lots of options for civilization growth. Has enough creative options for the game to stay fun.
"
1952,"This game is so addictive. Just wish combat units would be unique for every civilization and would be more selection of units to chose. However, this game is awesome. We hope Civ VII is better than any other Civilization game I've played so far. And I did not like Civ VI because of the cartoon type of figures. I didn't even bother buying this game, but I played a Demo version."
1953,"Some parts did not age well, but a great CIV game regardless."
1954,very nice
1955,"I forgot that I'm hunger playing this game once 


"
1956,Gut spiel
1957,"fun game, great when you do not have internet access."
1958,"I have played 2000 hours on this damn game and I'm still not a master. There is literally always something new in each game which makes it endlessly enjoyable. Plus, all-AI civ games are incredibly fun to set up & watch. Also, massive modding community with fantastic free content!"
1959,a good way to press fast forward on your life
1960,good game
1961,"A 21st Century version of Solitaire.  No, more like Risk.  Addictive, well done and informational."
1962,"Idunno, ask me again after another 500h..."
1963,its good game n shit
1964,I think this is the best civ game.
1965,Terrible game because of instability and constant corrupted save games. I love the game but it is again and again unplayable because of stability issues! Of all the hours I played I was able to finish only 3 games while getting bugged out with all the others. So sad Firaxis does not bother to iron out the bugs and instabilities....
1966,"It's alright, I guess. Lacking content overall."
1967,pretty good game allround
1968,Mid
1969,g
1970,The best Civilisation game till date! Civ 6 has its own qualities but man Civ 5 is something else!
1971,"I am very cautious with the term ""perfect"", but this game at this point is as close to perfection as a game can be. If you are interested in strategy games, this is the game to play."
1972,"sunk way too ,amy hours into this
"
1973,yeah.............(:
1974,Really interesting game that challenges you.
1975,"Absolutely love this game. I always come back to it. Great with friends too, but be prepared for a odyssey if you do."
1976,Work well on standard desktops
1977,"My favorite game of the Sid Meier's Civilization series so far. I own the newer one Civilization VI as well but still prefer this one over the newer alternative. I've sunk almost 210 hours into the game and once you learn the mechanics, you can adjust how casual or hardcore you want your session to be with the difficulty settings."
1978,"good gaem
"
1979,a true classic that stands the test of time
1980,good game
1981,yes
1982,i have yet to finish a single game but i love civ V. the early/mid game is so fun that I keep restarting over and over lol

1990,still epic 2022
1991,fort nite
1992,I like the complexity and depth of the strategies.
1993,"I like the sort of train set construction aspect of it.
Building things turn over turn.
Combat is tertiary at best. But you do have to pay attention to it."
1994,fun
1995,not to sound like an annoying overhype-y guy but this is genuinely one of the best games i've played in my life
1996,"Need A way to waste a 1000 hours of your life, this is it."
1997,"After nearly 1k hours and about 7 years of playing this game, I still have yet to play Venice. 10/10 game, still refuse to convert to civ 6 (don't how to play the game)"
1998,good
1999,Great game that I keep coming back to.
2000,"Amazing game, i liked the part where all my allies betrayed me. Im looking at you Washington, you smug-faced looking bitch"
2001,WORLD DOMINATIONNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNN
2002,Enjoy /r/civsaves

2015,Fun
2016,This game SLAPS!
2017,Far better then Civ 6 and fun with friends. Doing 4v4AI or 2V2s is quite nice with friends.
2018,It is really fun easy to get into but hard to win
2019,easily one of my favorite games. better than civ 6. totally worth the money
2020,"It is a long game with lots a tactics. You often have to be prepared to quit and start a new game because at the higher difficulty levels it becomes apparent that you are going to lose badly, LOL ! Happiness is the hardest part to manage if you are an aggressive player. I have played for over 2000 hours so you know that I like it."
2021,"I've played for 9,900 hours so far.  According to Malcom Gladwell at 10,000 hours I will have achieved mastery of complex skills and materials.  That should feel good!"

2023,"Of all the civ games this is the best, even better than civ 6, asI don't like the cartoon appearance  of civ 6"
2024,"good game
"
2025,One of the best turn-based strategy games ever made! I even like it more than Civ 6!
2026,"I am a 50 to 60 hour a week worker.  My life is complicated (as are most) so i don't know how to stop working, even when at home.  I get ""stir crazy"".  When i'm playing this, it occupies my mind and lets me relax.  i.e. If I am taking over the world, that pile of laundry can wait a little while."
2027,fun
2028,I've enjoyed all of the Civilization series to date.
2029,"Love these series, while it does have its issues, I still have plenty of fun."

2041,"Give me that city or i will nuke you

All you had to do was give me the city XD"
2042,"Really fun strategy game, one of the icons of an era. Highly recommended."
2043,nice cool dope fun
2044,Taking over the world and forcing other nations to bow before you and submit is fun. One more turn please just one more turn.
2045,great game
2046,Never a dull moment in the game. You do not know what will happen with each roll. Very strategic.
2047,gg
2048,This games like crack
2049,"gr8 game, does take some time to learn though but it is worth learning if u enjoy (solo) strategy games"
2050,Fun and easy to learn
2051,"I've played for 5411 hours.
Nuff said."
2052,"Great game to pass some time, it's very addicting to stay for an entire match."
2053,Better thans Civ 6 for sure
2054,fun game with lots of clicking
2055,"Is this game good? Is this game worth your time, maybe worth spending your money on? These are the wrong questions for the wrong game. The questions you should actually be asking yourself are... Are you ready to throw your life away? Are you ready to neglect your kids and wife, ditch that job and everything you thought you held dear? If not, don't get this game... please help me...."
2056,yeah whatever
2057,Hours and hours of pure enjoyment where the time just melts away.
2058,very good
2059,"My dad plays this too much, when I want to play all I see is this stupid game please never introduce your dad to this game or your like will be hell."
2060,Amazing

2063,"Build up your cities, conquer others."
2064,This is a very interesting game if you like war games that let you role play
2065,"Please... Let me play one more round. I can't stop playing it, just like World of Warcraft back in the day."
2066,"would be great if i could get back on
"
2067,I think the hours speak for itself
2068,The only game where I can team up with genghis khan and take over Africa.
2069,it's good I guess
2070,"This game, is, very, addictive.....

Prepare yourself.....

The sun will rise and fall many times with a single game. :)"
2071,Banger of a game to play with your dad. Shout out to campo while i'm here thanks for showing me the game :)
2072,"Do you need to sleep?
This game shows you how little sleep you actually need!"
2073,was a great game since the launcher update doesn't load. So i guess i'm not interested in anything 2k has they're hands on running hp laptop windows 11
2074,"Vanilla is boring. So, Buy the one with all DLCs.
Download EUI mod for more efficient interface.
Games could take 3-5 hours minimum.
Very addictive played alone, even more with friends.
If it became linear after some time, then make sure to check out game balancing mods (e.g. NQ mod) to make it more interesting and dynamic.
The perfect game to pass time in a long flight."
2075,would smash
2076,I thought I was having a good time on this until my friend rushed me down with a array of different Hun troops. Big picture kinda game.
2077,Definitely the best Civ game in the franchise.
2078,Better than civ 6 by a lot
2079,Either strategize for 4 straight hours or make an empire of level one cities named after Buffalo Wild Wings sauces
2080,"I'm of the camp that thinks this is still the best Civ. Civ 6 offers some improvements, but is such a different game. More random, more cartoony. I prefer both the look and gameplay of Civ 5. Both are fantastic games in a legendary series."
2081,"Less finicky than 4, less cartoony than 6. Definitely the sweet spot for now, in my opinion. We'll see what 7 brings.

I especially enjoy the way that you can add back in the more granular action that 4 had with the extra content, or leave it off for faster games."
2082,"Dido robbed one of my city states and bragged to me about it, so I used submarines to destroy her navy and floated carriers full of nukes to her capital.

It's ok."
2083,great game overall
2084,Just one more turn before I go to bed......and them you see the sunlight through the window
2085,"Still better than Civ VI? Maybe, but definitely still relevant and still one of the very best experiences on PC today. If you love Civ, you should still play and appreciate Civ V. Civ VI does not replace this game, it lives alongside it, offering a different experience that won't alienate fans of the previous game if Civ VI does."
2086,"I find strategy games fun and I like learning about different civilizations. I, also, enjoy playing with my son who loves the game."
2087,"Complex, but not nerdy. Challenging, but not demanding."
2088,"Great game but be sure to set an alarm for when you need to be done, because you will play till 4 am."
2089,This is definitely one of the best strategies of all time.
2090,"I played some hours, its ok I guess"
2091,Got it to remember my passed friend by.
2092,The Civ games have always been entertaining. They always expand and excite. I have liked (Just about every) Civ game I've played on every platform. I have played Civ V for a few years now on and off. Just a great game all around.
2093,Love it
2094,Civ 5 > 6
2095,Its still better than Civ VI
2096,"This is probably their best game. CIV 6 is good too, but I  much rather this one."
2097,"> Play Japan
> Go for Domination Victory, because your combat units operate at full power even with less health
> Win with Cultural Victory anyway

10/10 historical accuracy, would export anime again"
2098,"thumbs up, great game if you are a nerd and even better if you have OCD :)"
2099,"This such a good game, but make sure to watch what time it is so your not on it for too long"
2100,Its Civ 5.
2101,i like this game and have played it a lot it is slow and some may find it boring if they aren't into the style
2102,"fortnite
"
2103,This is the only game I've returned to time and time again. I haven't even downloaded Civ VI. Such a classic and solid game
2104,its lit
2105,So great
2106,"Still much better than Civ 6 can ever be
"
2107,LOL i put funny name for my religion
2108,"Learning the systems and ai of this game is incredibly fun. Though there are specific victory types/paths, I like to just discover the maps and play as I like. You can do this and the game is still extremely fun. I wuold recommend this game to anyone for how fun, interesting, and replayable it is."
2109,Best strategy game
2110,hmmmmmmm yes
2111,
2112,amazing and detailed would recomend to not a fan of over the top turned base games
2113,Much better than civ 6
2114,"Even after Civ 6 is out there, i still love the V, from 2010."
2115,"Very good game, with lots of people online"
2116,Great game dude
2117,My favorite Civilization version.  Still better than six in my opinion.
2118,Fantastic
2119,Still better than Civ 6 IMO
2120,"Many pleasant hours of strategy
"
2121,good game
2122,Better than Civ 6 ever will be.
2123,it's good
2124,"love this game and still play it regularly with friends. 
does sometimes crash on multiplayer or not allow saves to be loaded.
"
2125,IT IS AMAZING FOIAMWDA OIMA
2126,"I am a 45 yo father, probably one of the oldest people playing this game. I am a single farther to my Son, who is 14 now. My son got this game for Christmas in 2021 from his uncle, so we installed it on his computer and he started playing. By the end of the week he had 24 hours on this game. This was horrible for me, as it was already hard for me to find ways to spend time with my son, as he is always out with his friends or just watching YouTube. So I decided to make a Steam account and get this game to see if I could maybe play alongside him. I loaded into the game, picked my character and world and started playing but I was stuck on what you where supposed to do. I asked my Son for help and he hosted a game for me to join. I loved it as it was the best time I had spent with my Son since my wife had died. This game has ever since brought me and my son closer again and now we actually spend time together outside the house together as well. This game reminded me that there's fun to be had in everything, and it has brought both me and my Son many happy memories."
2127,has nuke happy gandhi
2128,Still better then civ 6 less complicated and better graphics
2129,This game is great for multiplier.
2130,"Good, bombed many counties, commited war crimes beyond your wildest thoughts.

Based and cool."
2131,WOULD YOU LIKE A TRADE AGREEMENT WITH ENGLAND
2132,very good simulation. i can't stop playing it. i've had it for years/
2133,hello i am lindsey lohan
2134,Not my type of game
2135,
2136,"I missed the conception and birth of my child playing ONE game of Civilization V. 

10/10 Would recommend"
2137,best civ ever
2138,
2139,"Great time wasting stratigic gameplay with AI controlled unreasonable rulers & go for the  domination of all over world peace.. as its easier to fear your enemies into submission(or wipe them out) than be diplomatic to save their citizens & land from your destructive chaos.
-Easy mode is casual and Fog of war is why you want to scout first to find wonders & resources for more control before they get claimed by the enemy.(The harder the difficulty the more ruthless the AI become)
-Change the amount of players/leaders involved as well as map size & configuration for more variations of how the game can turn out giving you more to experience.
--Domination of the enemies fastest way to end the game or you can go for technical superiority by dragging out the game a bit longer & unlocking all scientific researches.. TBH i've never gotten a diplomatic ending especially on a difficulty setting higher than Easy.
-Spend ~24hrs+ to finish a game all at once(like a true gamer) or just make a few moves & come back later to continue your periodic playing so you don't waste your life all at once.
~~Remember to HAVE FUN!!! & try new ways to experience the game!~~"
2140,goof fun
2141,"Great game
"
2142,i have grinded so hard that I am playing this game in another country
2143,"Little rough around the edges but it's a good, smooth and a classic civ game"
2144,Best game ever made great maps gameplay and quite eeptonal game design
2145,Stands up well. Always available for a good distraction
2146,"My dad approves, my 1,000+ hours are his.  He also has 6,000+ hours on his private account.  Mom doesn't approve though:("
2147,"I especially like that I can play as a Dutchman, not may games that I've seen allow that and I also loved the early access to a ship that could capture another! I've only played it as a guest but I'd buy it at a lower price, it's pretty old now I believe, I gained CiV. 6 as a freebie gaining CIV. 5 in that way would also be very nice. ;)"
2148,Yes I recommend for others to play.
2149,Classic game that never gets boring!
2150,very good and great if you wana take over the would hahahah
2151,Addicting......
2152,Buy 6
2153,civ 5
2154,Just a few turns more...
2155,I'd have gotten my PhD 6 years earlier if it weren't for this game but I still consider it time well spent.
2156,This is my first Civ game. I have moved onto Civ 6 at this point but this one does a lot of things better.
2157,Civ is the best turnbased game I have ever played. But Im not sure which version is best yet... let your kids play it and they will understand how this world works.
2158,"Game is great, but I feel Germany is missing a VERY prominent historic leader..."
2159,Good shit!!
2160,ye
2161,"I'm new to gaming, so there's a lot I still need to figure out, but this game is very fun!  Definitely glad I got it!"
2162,nice
2163,liked the choices
2164,"This game is the bomb.com. Sooooooooo much better than Civ 6 imo. But, let's be honest, every Civ game is the bomb.com. This one is just the nuke."
2165,Better than 6
2166,Just playing this bc I can't play Civ VI (game's broken to smithereens)
2167,very good strategy game if you are looking for a non-grinding game to keep you busy this is the choice
2168,Love it
2169,"Way better than Civ 6. Wish that the AI were a little more strategic, but it's still a great game."
2170,"Negative review of ALL 2K games until they get rid of the launcher bloatware

A good improvement over 4, same formula, and heavily milked players with DLC."
2171,"Strategy, World Domination, Encyclopedia of World History"
2172,"If I can sit and play a game for hours at a time and forget how long I've been playing, I'd call it good."
2173,"Be careful, this game is so addictive."
2174,gandhi killed my family
2175,"I have enjoyed playing this game for many years and I still find it challenging with the higher difficulty levels. Each of the kingdoms have unique and interesting aspects that change in many ways how the game can be played.  
I do wish the game could be played in a manner in which technological advancements were limited to a period in history say iron age or bronze age for example."
2176,1
2177,"It still remains to be one of the most engrossing and definitive means to play a Civilization/4X title in my honest opinion.
The modding scene, albeit much more toned down, allowed some wacky concepts to come into fruition without inherently defeating the general purposes the game originally had.
It is one of those games that is ridiculously easy to fall into but it can be exceptionally challenging based on how you conduct your games.
But the weight of my playtime is tied to friends and the stupid challenges we put on ourselves like getting X victory with Y civilization on an islands game map or collecting all of X hemisphere's landmarks/artifacts.
However there are some caveats the uninitiated should be aware of before choosing this or Civ 6.

1. Each game plays to its dynamics different and each game is fundamentally different to the point I would strongly recommend watching a breakdown video over it versus a guy who simply ran long-term games with old high school friends and would abandon the game simply because someone was a little butt-hurt or couldn't make it to the next session.

2. There is a sense of repetitiveness that a lot of folks do not want to admit to it. There's roughly a ""soft start"" and the ""definitive start"". The early ""soft start"" can genuinely make or break your civilization and sometimes make your ""definitive start"" a little more troublesome, dependent on the dynamics of who you are playing with and who you encounter. You essentially click the same buttons, start the same way, but it is more dependent on your encounters and interactions and if you happen to be relatively unlucky in this regard, it can sort of feel like you aren't really ""moving"" when you go between game to game. The biggest outlier in this regard would be if you chose to do Germany and switched over to Venice who's dynamics are unique to the point you need to seriously rethink your approach to the game. But in general, if you abandon a game, do know that you'll be doing essentially the same thing until you hit your civilization's high points and unique factors-""the definitive start"".

3. Finally, this game should be treated out as a long burn. It's not my point in my review to say ""play it this way"", but rather a genuine recommendation. If you go in thinking ""I'm going to play everyone fully and do every achievement"" good luck, sincerely. The game takes time and your decisions are very impactful as the game plays with causality as part of its method of action and conflict. While it's not inherently ""deep"" like other A.I. in the 4X genre, your game time will pad out the more you consider your actions and how many people you play with.

Think: ""historical minecraft"". You play and binge for two weeks and then it gather's space on your hard drive. There is absolutely no shame in not ""completing it"" as many folks buy this for the multiplayer with friends to have a few beers with or relax after a long day of sweating over some pvp game.

Cheers and enjoy!"
2178,Classic. Awesome.  I love this game. I still like it better than 6.
2179,"I'm not really quite sure why so many people prefer this game over its successor. As someone who played Civ V at the time in my life where looking back on it should spark nostalgia, the only thing i find myself missing when playing this game is the myriad of improvements Civ VI brings to the table."
2180,Just one more turn...
2181,"ok so steam doesnt support Civ5 anymore?  or is civ5 just dead?  because my game wont play anymore.
"
2182,"Screw ya'll I kept getting nuked by Ghandi. 

Very historical accurate though."
2183,"Having played all of the Civ games, this is actually my favorite, although it will still regularly beat me and frustrate me."
2184,Istanbul was Constantinople now its Istanbul not Constantinople
2185,Great game really enjoy it
2186,Used to play this every single day
2187,เกมโคตรเทพ เหมาะสำหรับคนที่คิดว่าชีวิตนี้มีเวลาว่างไปแล้วอยาก Time warp ไปเดือนหน้าเลย

2189,.
2190,this game is cool.
2191,Very good game to stream to IPAD and chill.
2192,"You always say ""Just one more turn, just 5 more turns."" The its 3 A.M.

NOT RECOMMENDED IF YOU NEED SLEEP FOR THE NEXT DAY."
2193,Good

2196,"Strategy fun, art nice, game good"
2197,I've played every Civ from the very beginning. This is my favorite. The new game has just changed too much imo.
2198,cool game bro
2199,Can be chalenging. easy to learn.
2200,.p
2201,"i have loved every variation of this game, it has yet to disappoint."
2202,"Much Strategy, Very Wow"
2203,Good stuff
2204,The best civ ever
2205,its a nice strategy game but fuck ganhdi
2206,"It doesn't matter how good of friends you are with Catherine the Great. She is a wench. She had Peter III killed and made to look like she had no part and that is how she plays Civ 5 too. You have been warned. Oh yes, and I love this game. If I was stuck on an island and could only play one thing the rest of my life... it would be Civ 5"
2207,"fun with friends :)
"
2208,Coochie man :(
2209,I've logged so many hours into this game. Love it
2210,Better than 6
2211,Best game of all time.
2212,Have always loved this game - even now it is my fav!
2213,It's alright.
2214,It is addictive! I just can't put it away.
2215,Classic 4x game. If you like 4x this is a must play.
2216,Better then civ 6
2217,"This is my very first civ, despite playing RTS games my entire life. I have to say, it is a bit overwhelming at first. It is hard for me to come into a game when all the guides online are hours long. However, once you get over the leap in, it is a great game. Civ fanatic friends of mine says its much better than 6, but I haven't played 6 nor have the expertise to comment.

My perspective as a new player, a lifelong Age of Empires guys, it is a fun game. It scratches the itch when you don't want to micro manage troops and zip all over the map and deal with little annoying troops doing their own thing. You are in control. You have your turn to think, strategize, read, and enjoy the journey. I really enjoy my time on civ. 

Some negatives for me, I know it is a cult following but my new to the game perspective might be helpful for those in that arena. No real ""campaign"" is kind of a bummer for me. You just keep rerolling exhibition games? Mmk... not really drawing me into any story here or anything. If I am wrong about this please feel free to correct me (and tell me where the story is lol!). Also, I tried for a culture win once, and honestly, I just don't get how it works, despite many guides. It was on easy though, which seems impossible to lose on... and it didn't matter in the end. The game seems pretty cement and will work out one way, no other. It just didn't ""hook"" me.

Overall, I think it is a good game. I took a giant break, might be back, but not overly compelled to do so either. I think it strikes a certain fanbase exceptionally well, and maybe I am just not that fanbase. My question is, are you too? If you are considering buying, just be cautious. The need to buy all DLC's for it to be ""the game"" is also a bummer. I guess the more I go on, the more negative my review is becoming. Sort of like my playing experience. Enjoyed the ride, for a moment. But not up at night thinking about riding again. The game is good, but might just not be for me."
2218,Do not play this game if you have responsibilities/obligations that are time sensitive. They will dissapate. Only Civ 5 matters. Time becomes dust. Reality falls into meaninglessness. Only Civ 5 will remain. One. More. Turn.
2219,yes
2220,Just feels better than Civ VI
2221,"Great chilled out game to play with friends, can easily steal 8 hours from you on a free day!"
2222,it brings back my memories when i was 7-8 yrs old. back then i was playing pirated version on my potato laptop (still the same now but different laptop xd) and spent hundreds to thousands hours in game.. and for me civ 5 much better than 6.
2223,Russia is hot would play again
2224,good game
2225,It do be kinda fun doe
2226,Excellent Game.
2227,文明6回归到文明5

2233,sometimes i like to set the difficulty to settler/chieftain and become a warmongering expansionist bastard for a domination victory;
2234,fun game classic and timeless
2235,"Its like civ6 lite
"
2236,"Still playing this game, years and years later. Just check my total hours played! If youre on the fence about getting it, bite the bullet. Its better than Civ 6"
2237,You can do the funny russia v ukraine. but russia wins. so its a insta 10/10
2238,Fun thing
2239,gg
2240,fun

2242,ONE MORE TURN
2243,great game strongly recommended
2244,Addictive but slow
2245,Better than the new one
2246,Only game I've ever played for 500 hours and still suck at. Need to play one more turn...
2247,...just... ...one more... ...turn...
2248,"I had my reservations when someone bought this game for me for a gift, unsure if it was even my thing. After apparently 368 hours, I can safely say that Cid Meier's Civ V is indeed my thing. My favorite part is making custom worlds and seeing how things play out/exploring. Absolutely recommended!"
2249,"I may only have 277 hours at the time of this review and owned it since 2019, but it's amazing. Possibly one of the best games I've played, I don't care for Civ 6's gameplay, but Civ 5 with all it's expansions is worth it. Great time sink."
2250,It's a joy.
2251,as
2252,Played it for years I love it
2253,Aaaaaaayyyyyyyy!
2254,"fun game, always been a fan since civ 1"
2255,fun
2256,Great game!
2257,"Very good game. Looks hard to learn to play, but it is actually quite easy. First time I play and spend a couple of hours playing.

Advice: The tutorial cannot be saved."
2258,Engaging
2259,Best game ever
2260,I still don't know how to play this game
2261,good game
2262,"I've actually never finished a game before, I get distracted. But it's a great game to have on the side or to destress. Wish I could find something less about conflict and just founding and building cities instead."
2263,been playing for god knows how long and i'm still loving this game
2264,Still the best Civilisation game
2265,yes
2266,this game is the best game i have played in a while.
2267,My favorite strategy game of all time. It's just perfect in every way.
2268,this game is dope.
2269,"I personally don't see much to dislike about this Game. I wish the Space Race actually allowed you to go to Space, though; that shit would be sweet. Civ offers a God-tier social experience, and an almost addictive playing experience. I give it 9/10 because nothing is perfect, but this game almost cut it... if only going to space were an option."
2270,im bad and dumb
2271,"Good fucking game, but worse than civ 6 so..."
2272,YA
2273,ITSNITS
2274,"It's alright I guess, give me one more turn and I'll tell you more..."

2277,good
2278,good world bulding game
2279,An absolute gem of a game. I just can't get int Civ:VI...it feels too slow comparatively.
2280,Fun
2281,yeah it's pretty neat
2282,"Brilliant game and not as cartoony as number 6 which is better.
easy to customise games and fun to be diplomatic with city states. Civ never failks to be a good game (apart from  the civ revolution on xbox)"
2283,Dying ass gimma
2284,my friends dont play with me ):
2285,A1 from Day 1
2286,game good.
2287,"Just... one more turn. *Looks at the clock noticing 30 minutes have passed.* Just... three more turns.

It's highly addictive, has comfy graphics, and endless replayability. Civilization IV enjoyers will trash this game for it's simplicity, lower emphasis on religions, and lack of unit stacking, but I love this game for exactly those reasons. Also I kinda like the hex tiles more than the squares, and the soundtrack is far less annoying. The narration isn't as good, but you can mod Leonard Nemoy's voice back in via the Workshop. 10/10 game."
2288,"Great game even for how old it is. Has a lot of replay value, and the ""just one more turn"" mentality will cost you dozens of hours of your life..."
2289,It's good
2290,mid
2291,fun
2292,This game was my all-time favorite since the sixth grade. It has helped teach me history while still being amazinglu fun
2293,it's alright
2294,"It's very fun. I enjoyed the base game more than the expansions overall, but it has a lot of replayability with the scenarios and mods available."

2302,Awesome game!
2303,Love this game. It is most excellent
2304,it good
2305,"This game runs like absolute garbage on a modern system. You are at a catch 22 situation when choosing to run the game in DX9 and DX10/11 mode. If you select 9, the game has a ton of graphical glitches but system performance is decent. If you select DX10/11 mode, your CPU will be pegged at 60%+ while the game is running. The game OFTEN crashes and other apps cannot draw over the game. The core game is fun, but with how many people are still buying and playing this game, you would think the developer would continue to support and fix issues."
2306,PRETTY GOOD

2312,meh *listens to music*
2313,wasted my life so sad
2314,good.
2315,"played it for a bit, it's ok"
2316,"'Just One More Turn' ....... yea okay. I've yet to stop playing this game over the years. It's the best 'break'  from the MMO/RPG games we all play, but just know 'breaks' may last days, weeks even!"
2317,"good 
"
2318," My little Crack addiction, best civ game, better than Humankind with the dlc added"
2319,It is a relaxing game.  I use it to unwind and just 'zone out.'  The music is fabulous.  The graphics are fabulous.  I really like this game.
2320,"If you want to play a game that you can't ever stop playing, I'd recommend this one. Saying the gameplay is addictive is an understatement, it's also satisfying. While Civ VI has its charms, I find myself coming back to this one again and again."

2328,good!
2329,"Better AI would have been nice, otherwise its a nice game to wind down after a long day.
Would recommend :)"
2330,for big brains
2331,"The game is great, it has a ton of fun mods as well.

Even if in some ways I think Civ4 is better, Civ5 brings a lot to the table. The AI feels better than Civ6, where it was erratic and random.

If you like any other Civ, definitely play CivV. If you never played Civ, this is a good place to start.
The map editor is good too."
2332,"One. More. Turn. Just one more. 

Amazing game. Lot's of replay value! (Trust me, at the time of writing this I have almost 600 hours invested in this game!)"
2333,"One of the best games of all time, and although I wish it had some of Civ 6's gameplay additions, I'll take Civ 5's gameplay, UI, AI, even the graphics (getting older but still very clear and easy on the eyes, unlike 6) any day of the week. Civ 5 is one of the quintessential ""just one more turn...why is it 3 AM?"" games, while 'playing' Civ 6 is like suffering through teeth extraction."
2334,2000 hours NOT wasted
2335,its alright
2336,Civ?
2337,"Civ is the best strategy game for me! I have played other strategy games but Civ rose above all else. The depth and complexity of the game makes you spend countless hours without you noticing it.
This game is very addicting. You will really get hooked. ""Just one more turn!"" will never end.
You have been warned!!! ^_^"
2338,very good
2339,i have 500 hours in the game solid
2340,"can' t quite get a grip on how to really play the game yet i am really bad at strategy games but still like them and this one is also very nice and casual to play on yourself.

2357,great
2358,nice
2359,love this game keep coming back to it!
2360,I've ruined my sleep schedule on multiple occasions
2361,"Such a fun game. You get to controll all the things you need, or want It is also a fun game to play with Friends. Would be nice if there was a friend code so someone who cant afford it, could still play with you."
2362,"Lots of hours can be poured into this game without getting bored. It has a very diverse system of the different cultures and progressing through the game from a few cave men to massive robots is very exciting. Although the gaphics are pretty messy and buildings often clip. Very good game.
7/10"
2363,"in sid meiers big civilisation 5 you play as Sid Meier, exploring the wonders of the world and meeting new friendes along the way,but watch out for polish  people :steamthumbsdown:"

2365,"i like to drop atomic bombs on every on who think they tuff, then i pull down my pants fart on the screen and sniff it . it delightful"
2366,Really good and addicting game but i really needs the DLCs to be playble. Id also recommend downloading LEKmod and HB map script to make the gameplay less monotone in the long run.
2367,"I'd call this a crash simulator, except it doesn't simulate the crashes....
They're very real."

2384,No contest 5 is better than 6. I went back to decide if I wanted to spend the money for Babylon in VI and just stayed. Have played since IICTP (so III introduced me to the official series).
2385,i like gme
2386,it fun play more
2387,Fun
2388,Game is good - it's at it's best in single player when you know enough about the game to pick interesting campaigns/settings and before you've played so much that you've done/seen it all.

2390,Come to OJ Simpsonville! The water is fine!

2411,"amazing game, been playing since elementary and now im a junior in highschool."
2412,"Some of the reviews on here have people who have played the game for less than 100 hours, talking about if it's good or bad.. that's cute. Honey, I didn't even know you could make a giant killer robot until I was over 1000 hours in."
2413,good
2414,Good
2415,I know other people will like this game. But im just not someone who likes turn based strategy. I like real time strategy but if you like turn based strategy you will like this game.
2416,just one more turn

2434,"Its Civ 5 what other reason do you need
"
2435,ruined my fucking life
2436,"A well made and very engaging game. This was my first civ game and the amount of customization blew me away. Setting different map types and layouts, different nations to add or play as, and the ability to turn off some victory types makes the game fresh each time you play. The modding scene is great, and the multiplayer is quite good."
2437,k
2438,I luv war!
2439,it's good
2440,best game ever
2441,Game is very entertaining and can be played solo offline which is what i need
2442,"Obviously this is an amazing game but for those wondering about Steam Deck: yes, Civ V works perfectly on it! And I’d say I prefer playing on Steam Deck to my regular PC!"
2443,My fave civ game by far
2444,good
2445,"Skip this, pick civ6 instead no matter how non clean it is, it is widely better than this game that aged awfully.

Typical overrated hype just because it allows make deeper mods, so many boring designs:
- Traffic jam awfully managed.
- Ugly graphics trying look realist but only lack of clarity.
- Very bad UI with very few polishing, it's not an indie game but an AAA, a shame.
- Lame research tree with poor choices, yes, again.
- Building is ultra repetitive and annoying, and those wonders requesting all city build the same building, it's saying a lot on the game expecting it can happens, and building fake choices, or at least too basic.
- Happiness just at global level, very bad design, and as expected, easily blow up constraint, 30+ towns, 120 happiness, first play...
- City nations are half baked, repetitive, borderline spaming, a desperate effort to fill the gameplay.

The list is long, sure there's good point as parts of diplomacy, and it's a civ game, but it's so tedious, and the very bad idea of a traffic jam simulator, lame."
2446,it is a good game for me and mroe
2447,After 500 hours it becomes especially nice.
2448,The best ever strat game

2457,"I've been playing this game casually since 2014. I have loved nearly every minute of gameplay. There are certain elements I prefer in this game over civ 6, namely the movement rules and this game not having housing and amenity rates. There are so many cool strategies to learn to get you started on a really fun game. I myself am really bad at this game, I have barely worked my way up to difficulty level 5 after watching lots of Deity playthroughs from Marbozir on Youtube: but I love this game regardless."
2458,"Civ VI can't compare, although it's good in it's own way. V is legendary."
2459,"This was my first Civilization game, and I would recommend it to everyone. 10/10"
2460,"ah yes, very nice"
2461,"Doesn't work. Don't buy.
The worker unit is broken, the main unit for the game. They do nothing. So the game does nothing."
2462,I like how you can become a god
2463,The huge amount of options allow you to customize how you play and the world you play in. It appeals to warmongers just as much as peaceful players(me)
2464,iz good
2465,If you look past the quirks its a really fun game. There are so so many possible endings that you'll find yourself looking for unlikely victories.
2466,MEH
2467,"6/10 not as good as civ 3, but not as bad as civ 6 and beyond earth

2482,"My ""friend"" and I were playing together and doing very well. Suddenly my favorite city was nuked. The nukes had SIEGE INDUSTRIES plastered on the sides. His name is Siege. 

He and I are still on speaking terms but all of his cities are mine now. No more nukes. 10/10 would absolutely recommend."

2487,yes very nice

2490,"Indonesia wouldn't stop converting my religion (Birdism) to his own (Not Birdism), so I razed his whole country to the ground and left nothing behind to indicate to future archeologists that there ever was a Gajah Mada."
2491,"what is time. It's been so long. Empires have risen and fallen. Governments created and destroyed. Technology has improved beyond the imagined, disappeared, and been recreated. All the while I've been playing this game. What is time."
2492,"Hell yeah, this game hella dope yo. You know what the hell I'm talkin about here. I'm talkin getting mad hella dope up in this hizzy yo, that good good time when all the maracas come shakin down. Ye ye, that's the point you know. Goin nuclear Ghandi yo. Mad times bruv."

2495,Clasic Civ turnbased strategy its fun getting to know the tech list and making it work to your advantage against your enemy
2496,Fun
2497,One of my favorite games of all time! Must have for any gamers library :)
2498,the great battle of jeddah lost over 14 infantrymen
2499,Good

2504,LOVE THIS GAME
2505,"Don't let my hours fool you i have been playing this game for a long time almost 2000 hours to be exact this is just an alternate account, i love this game and that's all there is to it. if your looking for more specific feedback DM me and ill get back when i can"
2506,Sh**hole Publisher / Studio. Take your exlusives / timed exclusives and shove them up where the sun never shines. Get ft out of Steam with all your games and stop advertising here you greedy sh**s.
2507,Maybe I should switch to a higher difficulty
2508,yes
2509,"Fun game, one of the classics in the series."
2510,its ight. civ IV is better
2511,Way too addictive but worth it
2512,Very immersive and vast. 10/10
2513,Best Game Ever Created
2514,Its great
2515,"Prefer this over the newer Civ6, partially due to inertia -- I preferred Civ4 for several years after Civ5 came out (probably because it's tough to beat Leonard Nimoy as the narrator). Good overall introduction to the series, but starts getting very complex for new players because of religion and espionage if you're just learning."
2516,"I play and like Civ VI but I always find myself going back to Civ V. The gameplay, the flow, the mechanics all fit together better in my opinion. If they could combine the best in Civ V and the best in Civ VI, I believe we would have the perfect Civilization game."
2517,It's great!
2518,cool game <3 (:
2519,I have owned this game for years and I love to play
2520,Civ 5 is truly a game that will be hard to compete with and gives a nice nostalgic trip after a long time break
2521,Set aside 12 hours for a game to make your mates cry
2522,YES
2523,fooking wot
2524,"In my opinion, which of course is the correct opinion, this is the best edition of the entire series. I would recommend it to anyone looking for a game with high levels of replayability. Buy it now and try to stop playing before bed."
2525,"I'm posting this review because CIV 6 is absolute Poo-Poo. The developers need to look back at this game as an example of how the series should look, play, and feel in the future."
2526,me yes civ 5 yes civ 6 ok civ 5 yes
2527,yeah nan
2528,4****

2531,"My favorite game of all times, one that I return to again and again. Strategy, history, and the ability to creatively rewrite how the world unfolded.  

"
2532,fun
2533,"If you're a fan of grid strategy games, this one is out of control. From gameplay to a broad amount of choices this is by far one of my favorite turn based strategy games."
2534,Its good.
2535,good
2536,Great detail to game play. Very specific in orders. would  be great to have a little more control over contact with state cities.
2537,Cimbgvilization
2538,Civ V > Civ VI
2539,"This game was great, would love to play it again. Unfortunately, it will crash after the intro every time. I assume its due to windows updates and inability to keep up.. File validation and various launcher options bear no fruit.

I do not recommend buying this game because you cannot play it.

It was great."
2540,"I am running under Linux and depending on how my system is setup, its a good play."
2541,It is fantastic
2542,"fun strategy game, i like it better then civ VI"

2544,something bad is about to happen
2545,The Game is great and with Mods you can create the Ultimate Hitlarian society of your dreams. Or of course you can run it a pacifist MLP mods too. Either way the game is worth buying if you dont already have it.
2546,2
2547,i love to start a game play for 10 hours straight then start another game play for 10 hours straight start another game play for 10 hours straight start another game play for 10 hours straight start another game play for 10 hours straight
2548,"Good luck finishing a game. Always finds a way to stop working and corrupts game data. If you enjoy playing half a game then this is the substandard product for you. Steam is a joke. Steam support is a joke. All the support you get is a time consuming shitshow, I for one am done with this human junk. Pathetic"
2549,"10 years and 2770 hours, what more do I need to say?"
2550,Don't buy Civ VI
2551,"My sleep schedule is ruined. My life is in a disarray. 
Fantastic Game!"
2552,"One of my favorite games of all time. This game got me through some really rough times and I love it.
I have thousands of hours (not on steam) in this game. Owned it physically and It is so much better than CIV6 which has been made into a cartoony joke with hideous models. I think you should choose this one over CIV6 any day if it a contest of graphics. CIV6 has some fun mechanics but it truly is hideous. I hope CIV7 returns the game to its less goofy and cartoony roots. Until then CIV5 is simply the better option."
2553,"Civ V is similar to settlers of Catan, but it has a lot more depth. If you enjoy Catan I'd recommend giving this a go!"
2554,Best playing Civ game of them all.  Addicted.
2555,"If you're a fan of Civilization, this game runs well to its name."
2556,game sucks i go to BED
2557,"One of the best strategy games I have ever tried. Much better than Civ 6. The animation style on Civ 5 is much more fitting to the type of game Civ 5 and 6 are, and I hope that in a new iteration this animation style comes back, but elaborated and more mature."
2558,"Great game for people who are fan of this genre.
"
2559,it is fun and challenging
2560,The only bad thing about this game is that when you are about to take a city and the AI just decides to make peace and it ruins the whole point of the war.
2561,boring game
2562,One of the greatest games i have ever played!
2563,It has the most beautiful graphics
2564,Better then VI
2565,make war not peace
2566,A good way to loose yourself
2567,Civilization is one game which one can play on and on without break. A great multi-strategy game.
2568,its great
2569,"good game!
hope steam can give better service,not -324,-108,-105,-7,please!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
2570,With gods and kings+brave new world dlc its a classic. I have not yet played a 4x strategy game better than this.
2571,love this game. one of the best strategy games out there. timeless.
2572,"As fun (and addictive) as any others in the Civilization series.  Plays well on an M1 Mac.

(I received this game as a gift from a friend)"

2577,Very interesting and well organized strategic game

2579,Didn't think I would like it but it is addicting!!
2580,it is fun
2581,"all around great game
"
2582,amazing thought provoking strategy
2583,"Civilization series is the best turn based game, but earlier versions were better. Civ 2 & 3 were probably the peak games in terms of strategy & gameplay. Civ 4 was awful, Civ 6 is unplayable. Civ 5 is a nice balance."
2584,great game
2585,10/10 game. Fun to play with friends.
2586,Very fun experience. Had me hooked in the first 45 minutes.
2587,"Old, but gold..."
2588,Got bored after 15 minutes
2589,i made a religion called bird
2590,Just. One. More. Turn. (help I haven't seen my family in years)
2591,It's a classic!
2592,5/5 would drop a nuke on my allies again when playing co op.
2593,Just a very wonderful turn based strategy game
2594,"Highly addictive. Very easy to get into and learn in the early stages/difficulties - with a continuous learning curve. I'm around 390 hours in and I feel capable yet I still have so much to learn/improve, and each time you learn something new it expands the game further.

No two campaigns are the same, replayability is insane. I always find myself coming back to this game time and time again."
2595,Great play when you don't have internet access
2596,"One of the greatest versions of one of the greatest series by one of the greatest gamemakers of all time...I have been playing this series since I loaded it from floppy drive under DOS.  This game is kinda like the Velvet Underground is for music...the old saying is that if you can master this game you can run a country.
Going from squares to a hexagonal architecture changes the game a bit, as well as the inability to stack like units on a tile amongst other things...the rules don't change quickly but they do change the game and they make each version individual over time but there aren't really any bad versions...just different ones.
I have most of the game series produced by Sid Meier and they tend to run on PC and Mac and get updated to current platforms.
Great version and great producer...not a fps but if you go beyond that you will find this some of the richest soil for some of the greatest games ever made, and they stay up to date.
You may not always win but you will never lose getting this game or it's siblings"
2597,"Electronic Heroine, 10/10 recommend."
2598,"Basically a board game, love me some Civ 5"
2599,I like the balance between strategy and complexity. Civ V is the best civilization yet created.
2600,over 10 years later and its still $30 that tells you enough
2601,"This game has aged like fine wine, it lets your imaginations run wild."
2602,"one of the best
"
2603,"I played this so much, and it never seemed to lose its appeal.  Its like different games combined into one even when you play in one sitting.  Exploration, land building, city building, empire building, wonder collections, fighting.  As so many people have also said, I often found myself up to the wee hours of the morning going one... more... turn!"
2604,"nice game to pass the time, it runs well on stronger computers"
2605,good fun.
2606,"Veh nice.
"
2607,Love love love this game!!!
2608,If you love complicated strategy games this is the game to play. I never find myself bored and there are many different ways to try and win games.
2609,I enjoyed the experience!
2610,great
2611,"It's pretty good... I'm only a casual player, so not sure what my opinion's worth"
2612,nuke go boom
2613,It is good
2614,Fantastic computer board game sid meiers still knows how to make a game that draws you in and keeps you wanting to play
2615,hitler modd!!1!
2616,hehe nuke go kaboom
2617,"A mix of history, geography and game play allows you to rule the world by conquest, art, faith or diplomacy."
2618,yes
2619,litt
2620,I have played this for over 5 years. It is never not good.
2621,this was the first civ game i played and i STILL love it years later!!
2622,"Great game, Really fun"
2623,"If you want to lose hours of your life and your family play this game. You will lose all of your time, a solid, fun rts game tho"
2624,Strats good.
2625,Great game of strategy. Best to reach a level where you win sometimes and lose at other times.
2626,yes
2627,its fun
2628,world domination fun
2629,GREAT GAME
2630,it is cool ig
2631,Game gud.
2632,"Unless you've watched videos on how to ""master"" the game, playing it organically is intriguing and immersive. Play around with the game options for limitless results. Still play it and still love it."
2633,an absolute classic.
2634,fun.
2635,"i like this more than Civ 6
"
2636,PLAY AT YOUR OWN RISK. I COULD NOT STOP TO SAVE MYSELF.
2637,Civ 5 is very well designed and very engaging.  I particularly enjoy the early stage of the game where the empire is established and one seeks to stabilize the position of the empire vis a vis rivals.  Later parts of the game are a bit tedious and time consuming though.
2638,qwer
2639,Its a lot of fun. Ask me again at 2000hours.
2640,"Everytime I play his game I get excited to create a vast and expansive civilisation that trumps any other, but by the end of the play session I feel utterly disgusted at the fact I've just spent 6 hours trying to improve a completely fictional relationship with Norway.

10/10"
2641,"fun
"
2642,great game
2643,My favorite game from one of my favorite series.
2644,still awesome
2645,its gas pew pew
2646,In this game you play as the iroquois. i rate this game a 8/10 because it makes me feel like i'm sid meier
2647,"Easily the best strategy game out there, the fact that you start in the ancient times and can then later go into the modern era and a bit beyond that is nothing short of Incredible and cool to me. I also love the fact that you can have old medieval and modern buildings in a city/city's which is kinda funny, it's a bit hard to understand at first but when you keep playing and learn it you will probably become the strongest Civ in the game and easily take out those fu@ckers named The Zulus."
2648,very good
2649,Gud gam
2650,This is my favorite game ever
2651,the best strategy game i have played
2652,12 years later games still gas
2653,Fun!
2654,great game
2655,I love a game that I can both play with friends and get stuff done @ the same time. :)
2656,all of sid meier's games are fantastic
2657,Just brillant. Prefer it much to Civ 6
2658,Always a great game for those into turn by turn history/conquer games
2659,good
2660,"Great game, I spend hundreds of hours playing it, I also bought more than once!"
2661,"Started a game in the morning
Played for 5 minutes
Turns out I played for 12 hours"
2662,"love civ 5
"
2663,"I started with ""Civilization II"" back in the 90's.  In my opinion, this is the best version of ""Civilization"" that has ever been released.  If you want an extremely customizable turn-based strategy game, I have found none better.  No two games are ever the same.  The graphics are decent and game play is not overly compicated.  The only real down side is the AI, which is a poor tactician, becomes extremely predictable and can only defeat a human player when it has overwhelming resource and combat advantages.  I highly recommend this game.  It is better than Civilization II, III, IV and VI in my opinion."
2664,chill out with some Pink Floyd and vibe
2665,By far the best and most pleasent way to experiance a civ game
2666,
2667,ah geez man
2668,i liked the fact that you can talk to the npcs. you can also take over everything! it's also not OP. the only problem i had with it was that it wouldn't let me in the game after a while.
2669,"Civ 5, and Beyond Earth are definitely the best in the genre that I've played"
2670,Great fun
2671,The best
2672,Still my favorite game ever. Civ 7 should be an improvement(if it's possible) of Civ 5.
2673,I love the balance of the game and how it is so addicting
2674,Time to throw my life away
2675,It's aight
2676,Better than civilization 6
2677,Airstrike on barbarian swordsmen
2678,"I got it as a gift, the complete edition. As of writing the review, I easily put 3 hours, and I think I can easily put a lot more in this game, it's very addictive!!! I do recommend it!!!

Edit: This is dangerously addictive!!!"
2679,"Absolute best Civ game Ive played. Would have liked some small balance tweeks to diversify optimal plays but a great game that always has you saying ""just one more turn"""
2680,"Kinda good, might need more time to decide"
2681,It's a fucking Civ game. You don't need me to tell you how it is.
2682,good game
2683,AMAZING
2684,VERY EPIC
2685,it is a great game
2686,gr8 shit
2687,imperialism simulator. good

2689,BUSHIDO! DIGNIFIED! IT'S THE LAST STAND OF THE SAMURA!

2693,Best
2694,his canines become vampire fangs
2695,Lots o fun
2696,"Amazing game 
"
2697,Good game
2698,"Civ 5 best one yet. Had all the civ games. Should have stopped with this one cause the newer ones aren't that great.
"
2699,"Sadly the AI is so broken, no matter what you do they end up hating you, denouncing you and declare war on you."
2700,"Just one more turn’. I don’t know how many times I’ve repeated that phrase to myself, but Civilisation’s ability to entice its players for hours is one of its many strengths.

I would argue V is the greatest Civ game so far, and the DLCs only make it better. The combat system is straightforward. Watching your civilizations grow and become empires is very satisfying. Plenty of content for avid historians. The freedom to pursue multiple victories—domination, scientific, cultural, diplomatic or simply running out the calendar with the highest score—combined with the wide range of interesting faction bonuses and unique units makes it almost endlessly replayable.  

Michael Curran’s soundtrack, which is often overlooked, complements each Civ by giving them their own unique theme. I can listen to Terra Nova for hours.   

10/10 – The game is easily worth the money impossible for a strategy fan to resist picking up."
2701,much fun very wow
2702,best board game you can play on a potato
2703,"Highly recommend for fans of any builder/war genre. Difficult to understand if you just try playing without atleast playing the tutorial, which was extremely helpful and worth actually giving a playthrough to learn."
2704,nebushnawz deez nuts bitch you are skill issue
2705,one more turn bro
2706,爆杀文明6
2707,Easy to sink many hours into this game. Modding scene really helps balance the game and have fun
2708,One. More. Turn.
2709,"yup, its good"
2710,good
2711,the best
2712,yes
2713,"Fantastic blend of strategy and chance, with hours of play time. I prefer Civ VI's additional mechanics/content, but Civ V can't be beat when it comes to a ""conquerer"" style game."
2714,addicting
2715,"I wish they would stop making new Civ games, and just improve on this game indefinitely. I would very much be willing to subscribe to the continued improvement of this title. Indeed, I didn't even bother buying Civ 6. I don't see Civ 6 improving on Civ 5. Just put in more of the stuff that worked in previous Civ titles, like better diplomacy, espionage and animated World Wonders and Talking Advisors. Strive to make the best Civilization game instead of resetting the title again and again. I'm not buying anymore. This is the best Civilization title to date. Buy this one, rather than Civ 6."
2716,If you think keeping your partner happy and satisfied is hard try keeping your nation happy. You can't. You just can't
2717,The best of the CIV series.
2718,ha
2719,Great game and very addictive. You can spend hours playing this game.
2720,Always a fun time wrecking friends and crippling empires.
2721,great game
2722,help my brane is tiny (smal)
2723,The best TBS game ever. Although it seems old it is the best (even better than Civilization 6. because its graphics for teenagers)
2724,Game busts respectfully
2725,Get it for the mods
2726,"This is one of the greatest games of all time, definitely recommend for anyone who is interested in playing video games of any kind. This one is a winner."
2727,"Yeah, It's alright..."
2728,excellent
2729,"You make world history. By no means perfect, nor entirely accurate, but it comes about as close to reality as possible without being (too) overwhelming to learn. Beware - very addictive"

2742,"""Gentlemen -

While I receive, with much satisfaction, your Address replete with expressions of affection and esteem; I rejoice in the opportunity of assuring you, that I shall always retain a grateful remembrance of the cordial welcome I experienced in my visit to Newport, from all classes of Citizens.

The reflection on the days of difficulty and danger which are past is rendered the more sweet, from a consciousness that they are succeeded by days of uncommon prosperity and security. If we have wisdom to make the best use of the advantages with which we are now favored, we cannot fail, under the just administration of a good Government, to become a great and happy people.

The Citizens of the United States of America have a right to applaud themselves for having given to mankind examples of an enlarged and liberal policy: a policy worthy of imitation. All possess alike liberty of conscience and immunities of citizenship. It is now no more that toleration is spoken of, as if it was by the indulgence of one class of people, that another enjoyed the exercise of their inherent natural rights. For happily the Government of the United States, which gives to bigotry no sanction, to persecution no assistance requires only that they who live under its protection should demean themselves as good citizens, in giving it on all occasions their effectual support.

It would be inconsistent with the frankness of my character not to avow that I am pleased with your favorable opinion of my Administration, and fervent wishes for my felicity. May the children of the Stock of Abraham, who dwell in this land, continue to merit and enjoy the good will of the other Inhabitants; while every one shall sit in safety under his own vine and figtree, and there shall be none to make him afraid. May the father of all mercies scatter light and not darkness in our paths, and make us all in our several vocations useful here, and in his own due time and way everlastingly happy.""

2744,"I prefer this from Civilization VI. More ""robust"" game in  my opinion."
2745,As of the date of this review I only have 1636 hours played.....I guess it's good! :)
2746,6 way chess or somthing i dunno i'm bad at shapes
2747,"Like the games before it, this game is as remarkable and engrossing as it's predecessors.
It's wonderful fun and though there are adjustments to be made in the strategy due to the districts idea, it nonetheless is fascinating, offering new ideas on civilizations  and the unique units, buildings and abilities.
Heartily recommend this to one and all :-)"
2748,:)
2749,Won one match once with Gandhi's nuclear arsenal. Great game.
2750,please no
2751,I've always loved Civ ever since I was a kid and I'd watch my dad play the game. Growing up with the game and seeing it still giving out content makes me really happy. I don't really have any complaints on the game but that could be bias based on my love for it. I would recommend it to any one that loves turned based progression. Thank you Sid Meier.
2752,Yes. Good game
2753,"OK Great Game still and Civ 6 is nowhere as good

one wish - work on mac with Mods some work some dont"
2754,Awesome game
2755,g
2756,The game runs very smoothly on my Mac and the graphics and game play concepts are a big improvement on the previous versions of the game.
2757,"This is probably one of the best CIV games around. I liked CIV4 because it's resources were based on easy-to-edit XML files, but it's mechanics were pretty old-school. CIV5 is a welcomed upgrade to these as well as it's graphics."
2758,i like it
2759,good!
2760,cool strategy game
2761,"Love this version so much more than Civ VI!  More fun, challenging and better overall flow."
2762,its ok
2763,It's one of my favorite games of strategy. Civ 5 is by far one of if not the best version of the game to date.
2764,This is a very captivating game. Hours will pass before you realize it.
2765,Game good.
2766,nh
2767,not a bad game

2772,Very Addicting
2773,"Might as well finally write a review for this game since I have had it for almost a decade. This is by far one of my favorite games. I would consider a ""timeless masterpiece"" as it is something I can turn to every now and again for a long, solo game session where I can relax and just be alone with myself and civilization. Are there some downsides to a 12 year old game? Sure. But the pros of the game far outweigh them."
2774,who doesnt like civ?
2775,This game is amazing. I love to play it! You should certainly try! =)
2776,Very nice game play. Have played it for years still among my fav CIV
2777,It good; many big people.
2778,good soup
2779,Very good 10/10 worth the divorce and custody of the kids. I may never see them again buy Washington's calming face reminds me of why I play. Buy with dlc garbage without. I would donate money to this company however food stamps are not accepted.
2780,"Great Game, anyone who has played any other civ titles will love it."
2781,The play changes over time
2782,good
2783,Shocking time waster. One of those games you look at the clock and 2.5 hours have passed unawares. Different play-styles available. Singleplayer and multiplayer I really enjoy when warmongering monsters denounce me as a warmongering monster.
2784,.
2785,One of the best games! Used the concepts in my class!
2786,"very fun, honestly prefer this game to 6. only complaint is the trade system. AI always wants unfair trades even on easy difficulties."
2787,play for 500 hours beat deity then never touch again - beautiful game tho
2788,banging game
2789,this game is more addictive than crack
2790,"""Just one more turn""
- Me at 3am on a work night"
2791,h
2792,"good
"
2793,Don't piss the small bald man off.
2794,"naw evn gun lye to yo ah bruh, it do go har."
2795,"This one is generally ok, though sometimes when game ends its the game launcher keeps 'running' in steam  linked to QtWebEngineProcess.exe (some bug) that takes near all cpu process power. So your gametime would be logged incorrect, counting hours when you sleep/work, which is more a problem really only for those fella's looking to refund games within certain timeframes or perfectionists wanting to have accurate gametime stats on their profile for life."
2796,Addicting civilian killer game
2797,"It's such a fun strategy civilization building game featuring many great leaders from different time periods of real world history and each playthrough feels fresh and different. 

But be careful, one of these small and insignificant civilization AIs might flourish and blow up in your face in the form of a nuclear bomb... Oh my these Romans are crazy!"
2798,Forever Stand Refugee City 1.
2799,Game has been very fun when you have friend's who want to play something relaxing while talking. The AI either make very stupid decisions or aggressive ones that make us all gang up on them.
2800,"It dosnt quite live up to CIV 3, i dont like how it looks a little more ""cartoony"" Theres some new game mechanics that I really enjoyed. This one is wayyyy better than Civ 6. I think its worth the money, good way to chill and game"
2801,Still better than Civ 6. No Quitters mod highly recommended. If only they would fix the technical difficulties in multiplayer games =/
2802,yes
2803,Just one more turn...
2804,good
2805,Just one more turn. game can be addictive asf. definitively recommend.
2806,"gud game
"
2807,Great library rush only
2808,"Best Civ game by far.
Replayability is endless.

One of my favorite games when i just want to sit back and relax while gaming.
Thumbs up."
2809,I only play this between 11:30 at night and 3 in the morning. I dont i think its addictive this sounds more like a choice.
2810,"Oh, I've probably been a rather gruff individual on this game. But I learned to be this way. The funny thing is, I like the ethos of historical grimness, because it puts the present in perspective. But maybe my political condescensions could be a negotiated behavioral area of critique. However, the funny thing is that I've learned tech itself is far scarier than I have ever been. Otherwise, the game is very stimulating and replayable and I recommend it to all sorts of gamers with historical interest and a fair talent for strategic thinking."
2811,The best Civ game since Civ II.
2812,"GOOD GAME
"
2813,I have play a lot of civ games.  Love Civ5 and Civ3. Different but very playable!
2814,I like 900+ hour you can trust.
2815,I love it.
2816,"Been playing Civ since ver 1, still love it! Always looking forward to more."
2817,Best strategy game ever made. 10/10
2818,This is one of the best strategic  games that I have ever played...it keeps you thinking many steps ahead in order to not either over extend your forces or under explore the environment. I've played many hours and it is never the same game.
2819,Dude guyyyy.. This game is wicket gooood
2820,upomoc
2821,"Turn-based strategy game for enthusiasts. Definitely recommend, for beginners and advanced players alike."
2822,awesome
2823,"great game, lots of permutations"
2824,A good time waster
2825,Best game I have ever played. Over 1k hours in over 5 years and I still can't put it down. Not to mention the amazing variety of mods.
2826,"It's fun, but careful of denouncements, warmongering, and growing borders too quickly. The AI gets super jealous if they know about you."
2827,It's good.
2828,Still can't win on Deity
2829,This game can ruin my life if i ever lose my self control
2830,"This is truly one of the greatest strategy games going, 100x better than CIV 6 and SM Beyond."
2831,Doesn't get old
2832,Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa
2833,Still prefer this to Civ VI in the end.  A classic with plenty to offer.
2834,It's good.
2835,I once played for almost 15 hours straight.... too scared to play again.
2836,"Tested it a bit.

*scratches arm*

Uhh. It's alright.

Check the mods >.>"
2837,got back in 2012 and have been playing it for years always liked the civ games
2838,"Hey, you know what? This game and its expansions is pretty good. And it goes on sale for cheap, and you can run it on most computers available over the past 10 years. Dunno how it compares to Civ6, but i'm not buying the same game again, either. You only need one Civ, and since I can't run Civ2 anymore, this is it (I miss the barbarian tigers from Civ3 or 4 though, to be honest).

Approving grognard noises"
2839,"After A LOT of hours in Civ VI (with all DLC's), I got this through a Humble Bundle with all the DLC's.  After only 9 hours, in Civ V, I can tell that newer is NOT always better and that CIV VI was a step in the wrong direction. Everything is much more straight-forward in V, the ""playability"" seems better, the Civ's more balanced, and of course, load-times are lack of crashes in V are suuuch a nice change from VI. Just a much better game than VI and I strongly recommend it to anyone who is choosing between the two or a fan of VI who lost interest but wants a SOLID strategy game."
2840,Fantastic thinking game.
2841,it's fun
2842,Civ
2843,"Don't buy VI, go for this one instead. Endless fun."
2844,"Fantastic game, addictive still many years after release.  Have played way too many hours of it, and will play way too many more hours of it."
2845,Fun game 1500 hrs of play and still fun
2846,"i buy every DLC, play 18 min. uninstalls. kills my self :/"
2847,"A great game of world conquest that reflects many of the all too real challenges that any civilization will face.  An excellent game for dedicated competitors.  The AI is severely limited for single play defaulting to massive resources rather than intelligent play.  Still, it's better than playing chess with yourself."
2848,This game makes your brain release the dopamine
2849,great
2850,Timeless and addicting.
2851,!!!!
2852,Get all the DLC. It makes it a much more complete game.
2853,.
2854,How do I stop playing?
2855,Imperialism Lite. Great for kids
2856,garbage trash
2857,Best game ever.
2858,Fun and addictive!  It stays fresh and engaging throughout the ages.
2859,Civ 5 best Civ. If you think otherwise reevaluate your life.
2860,gaming is gaming man and this game fucking sucks on windows 10 DO NOT BUY IT it will glitch the fuck out
2861,Great game
2862,This game is most excellent.
2863,This is it !!
2864,"Its just a great distraction, every game is different"
2865,Love the game play
2866,its you to do this to get that.
2867,"Would you recommend this game to other players?
yes"
2868,On another account I had at least 2000 hours. So yes I reccomend it
2869,Very Fun And Addicting
2870,shit company
2871,Dobri moćaki
2872,Yes
2873,yep
2874,greatest strategy game of all time!
2875,pretty fun
2876,"good game, very nice. fun stuff. good content. kill indigenous barbarians, much fun. my wife left, very sad. game is great"
2877,Grate Game !!!
2878,Very addictive turn based strategy game.
2879,better then civ 6
2880,"This series has been so much fun since I was a young teenager. There is a lot to be gained from understanding politics, economies, and social economics. There is so much strategy involved here you can play from many different angles - be it all out military and war or maybe a cultural domination victory. 

Civ is a great way to spend time learning and having fun. There's plenty of valuable history and education here."
2881,It's a classic; I prefer Civ 5 to Civ 6. because the gameplay is better balanced.
2882,fun game
2883,good game
2884,good for long sessions.
2885,good
2886,"Make sure auto-save is pretty aggressive and play your little heart out.

I love this version of Civ. Wonky AI, deep systems, grumpy world leaders. What's not to love?"
2887,"What can I say about Civ V that hasn't already been articulated better somewhere else? The Civilization series is the defacto XXXX game for many, and Civ V is the defacto Civilization title. Before they added way too many systems and subsystems and complexities in VI, there was Civ V. Just the right number of leaders cover most of the civilizations that you would want to see. The game was balanced and unbalanced in just the right way to allow for creative, original gameplay without being to stifling or stale. The tech and policy trees were well developed to allow for people to pick and choose what they wanted to do in a per-game basis without being pigeon-holed into a single playstyle. Any victory was possible with any leader given the right set-up in game, something that feels lost in the newer title. Whether it be through the world congress or domination or space exploration (and nothing else because who goes for the tourism victory?), the game is fun AF in singleplayer or multiplayer. If you have even a passing interest in XXXX games, this is a good place to start, especially with friends. Pick the game up on sale and blast out with friends!"

2889,Its a great game to pass time with and to build your own empire!
2890,nice
2891,One of the best!!
2892,just awsome :D
2893,"Cool game, :0 got recommend from a friend"
2894,very cool
2895,ity good
2896,"If you love strategy games, this is a  classic."
2897,"Absolutely amazing game, I love the variety of playing experiences the game provides!"
2898,Ugha bunga bocka slavenska fooreshtin und forevermore thine joyous playe shall be decreede as a generally good time to spend with friends. 5/5
2899,"The game doesn't work after the upgrade to Windows 11, so until this has been fixed I wouldn't recommend it to anyone who has Windows 11 on their gaming computer. Hopefully this will be fixed soon, since I would like to play it. Both Windows 11 and Windows 10 with Enhanced security cause problems with some games and other programs, especially older ones. This is something to have in mind before deciding to buy a new gaming computer with Windows 11, upgrading to Windows 11, or raising the security level of Windows 10 to Enhanced security."
2900,"very fun alone or with friends, 100% recommend!"
2901,1
2902,The Utilmate gaming experience where Cracow needs whales and Vatican City wants Pierogi.
2903,"I always tell myself this is last turn for tonight, and then the sun rises."
2904,"It's a lot more relaxing than CIV VI, I'll tell you that."
2905,/
2906,wonderful fantastic game that has captivated me for hours. I plan on coming back for as long as this is the best game in this franchise! Recommend 10/10 great=greatness
2907,"even if junky from time to time, Civ is one of my favorite game for sure, even if i dont play it as often as other games, i will always find myself spending some hours here and there. Tho, if it wasnt for the big modding community i feel like a lot of the small issuies would had make me stop playing the game entirely.

The major problem with this series, is how the makers will try and dry your money by doing dlc bellow average while selling them AT The SAME PRICE Of The Vanilla Game For EACH major DLCs... never in the world do i think G&K and BNW would be worth 33(CAD)$ Each. At Best it would be the price for both."
2908,its alright..........
2909,"This game is like the broccoli of video games. You go out, eat some junk food and get wild. It starts to catch up with you, competitive scene gets you stressed. You start to fatten up and the grind gets boring. So you decide to go on a health kick and eat your greens, maybe even start working out.

This is your greens, and being ""healthy"" is putting in enough hours a week into this game to qualify for benefits in the eyes of United States labor laws. I might move onto another Civ game when we reach Civilization VIII, but in the meantime I will be stuck trying to 100% this game because it's an absolute masterpiece."
2910,great game
2911,An addicting and highly replayable 4X strategy game. The first evening I played this game I didn't get to sleep until 5AM.
2912,"Whenever I have one less military unit than the IA they think ""all your base are belong to us""."
2913,"Great multi
Boring single
Why bother with campaign
Give us mods in multi again
And resyncs are more annoying than friend complaining about being raided by barbs again and being unable to win 1v2 with warrior lol"
2914,It's good
2915,"Oh look, it's 4am. Just one more turn"
2916,"Nice, even though I can't really get back into it after Civ 6."
2917,Chill game

2929,just one more turn!
2930,Just one more turn... oh no gandhi! yada yada yada you get the idea. Best civ inmho. Yum yum can't get enough.
2931,"After playing Age of Empires and Age of Mythology in my childhood , this was the next game i had to pickup. For me personally Civ4 and 5>>>>other Civilization games. I have heard 6 is really good now but 5's mechanics and A.I always bring me back to it."
2932,GOod
2933,"Probably my favorite of the civilization games, the DLCs are also fantastic"
2934,great game great way to spend a day
2935,Great game.
2936,Good Game
2937,"It might just be me but I enjoy the art style more than Civ 6 the Leader character models are less ""cartoony"" than 6 and just seem more detailed in general also the cinematic for 5 is amazing. I would recommend Civ 5 over 6 for new players."
2938,"I once had a moment when I realized how horrible I was in a game of Sid Meyer's Civilization. My empire, mighty India, stretched across a third of the world, An entire continent was at my command, plus a wide sprawling dominion of tropical islands in the seas to the west. My empire wanted for nothing, any material possession was available. But I wasn't happy, for I didn't want any of that. I wanted the one thing I could not have, Supremacy. My empire was grand, but there were others, grander, more powerful, further ahead in technology and culture. So I made a deal with the devil. I re-tooled my empire from a land of prosperity and freedom to a machine of war. I grasped at any advantage I could muster. A caste system to keep my people in line, nationalism to draft unwilling bodies into my army, and sickening coal power plants to light my factories so that they may never cease their toiling. I subjugated any other civilization weaker than me while envying those above me, every move a stepping stone towards invading my more powerful enemies. And one day, I thought I was ready. I had assembled a powerful army and navy to reach out across the oceans and let death touch the lands beyond. Tanks, planes, and marines in their thousands left my shores. My opening move against the portuguese(the second strongest empire, with I as the third) was one of underhanded shock-attack. Their mighty navy lay in its port near their capital, and I struck there, burning the ships in the harbor after the city had fallen. Then, a brutal, pointless war raged for a generation. The landing point was so far from my empire that it took years for reinforcements to reach my battered army every time it was near defeat. And in the end? It didn't matter. The mightiest of the civilizations, the Malinese, intervened in the war, taking in Portugal as their vassal. Their army bore down on all my people had been forced to suffer for like a hammer against clay. Within a few short years I was forced to retreat onto my ships to save what little I could and fall back as they consumed my overseas empire. At this point, the cracks were beginning to show. Unrest from generations of dying choked my cities almost as much as the smog from the factories. My empire was decaying from within, growing feeble from years of neglect. I could've accepted that I could not win. That my position was respectable and enviable, and let my people return to peace, but no. My greed, my arrogence, the darkness that boils within my thoughts could not accept that. So I made my decision. I would wipe the Malinese from the world. Once more I put my people to work building an arsenal. Not one of men and guns, though there was plenty of that. It was an arsenal of ICBMs and tactical nukes, a fleet of submarines to slip by my enemies defenses and attack them where they were vulnerable. It was an arsenal of indiscriminate death, of cruelty, of genocide. I filled the seas around Mali with missile subs and crammed my production centers with ICBMs, but I did not attack. For even with my uniquely mad plans, I knew victory was still beyond my grasp. But then I saw it. Mali had launched a space ship to Alpha Centauri, and if it arrived before I could reduce their homeland to a smoldering waste, I was finished. So I let fly with fire and thunder, Billions died in the opening volley, and a land unblighted by war from centuries of security was torn away to one of suffering and loss. None of the Mali asked to be my enemy, and in truth, my attack did little to cripple Mansa Musa's armies. Almost all that I killed were innocents. All that I brought was suffering."
2939,"nice game, makes you time travel"
2940,"Steals alot of ideas from Elden Ring

the few things they managed to do for themselves, seems like a blatant rip off of Sekiro, another game that ripped off Elden Ring

the japanese culture has actual katanas, just like sekiro

The minecraft elements are not lost to me either 

I see you, Square ENix."
2941,"civ is life 
"
2942,"Half the content isn't viable gameplay-wise. Even worse on singleplayer deity. Doesn't take long to discover certain policies, units, wonders, pantheons, religions, and civs are tenfold worse than others."
2943,good game
2944,Ahhh Civ :)
2945,its better than civ 6
2946,"hate sweden, not racist, just dont like em"
2947,Great game to spend an evening with 10/10 would reccomend
2948,Great game overall.
2949,fantastic strategy game.
2950,Fantastic game.  Endless hours of fun.
2951,Fuck you Ghandi stop nuking me
2952,Still dunno what I'm doing tbh
2953,the mechanics are great
2954,9/10
2955,"""One More Turn"" gets me every time. Say goodbye to your free time, and productivity, If you can't stand the graphical style of Civ 6 then come back to ol' Civ 5 - it'll sort you out. Lekmod is god tier FYI highly recommend adding this to the game."
2956,"This is best version. Just need updates to this version for more civ, etc."
2957,"Great game, a lot better than Civ 6"
2958,good game fun survival aspects
2959,Fun Game
2960,Big Civ fan so big thumbs up.
2961,"Game that you will always have a place in my heart and I could loose many hours playing it. 
Now that it is cheap I recommend it!
It is much better (in my opinion) than Civ 6"
2962,good game
2963,very good stratagy game
2964,its too legit
2965,Relaxing.
2966,dope game.
2967,"i'm personally not a fan of these grand strategy games, but my friend held me at gun point and demanded it try it so...

it's fun. i like china and polynesia"
2968,"Would get stomped by my friends who picked the Huns again, 8/10"
2969,great stuff
2970,!
2971,I always enjoy this game for years I have played every one from civ 1 up till 5
2972,Fun strategy game. So fun that I don't want to write a long review so that I can play it.
2973,11 years on and still hands down the best Civilization game out there.
2974,Yes.
2975,e
2976,it's okay
2977,"A brilliant and comprehensive strategy game encompassing the operation and tenets of human societies, political structures, military action and the riches to be had from resources in the ground. Highly recommended although very addictive!"
2978,400 hours turn into seconds very fast in this game
2979,The first video game I ever played was Civ 1. This is a game Civ 1 would be proud of.
2980,"If you like this better than Civ 4, you are a MORON. And yeah, you better believe them be fightin' words."
2981,My ancestors would be proud
2982,WOW! SO ADDICTING! WOW! START DON'T STOP! 10/10!
2983,Great game if you don't like sleeping.
2984,Keeps you occupied for hours and it's really fun!
2985,fun
2986,I tried it. It is nice. Just one more turn before bed.
2987,"Great game for multitasking, just have it windowed and you can click in and out as you need"
2988,"""Just one more turn"""
2989,"I don't like the UI and crashes often. Long load times for games in progress. It's a civ game I enjoy it but if you are reading this to figure out if you still want it, no. No you do not. It's at least a step above beyond earth, go with 6 or ""VI"" or whatever is newer after this review is posted."
2990,"Perhaps my download is buggy, but I've noticed certain avatars are excluded from specific choices. for exampe, Pocotello cannot ever get a religion because no great prophet will ever appear. the icon will appear in the right page line-up, but not as an actionable object in the left-hand. this is a serious lack of access for that culture. in fact, i've noticed all of the non-eastern hemisphere cultures face this sort of difficulty. i've tried to un and re install the game, to no avail. 
"
2991,Good game. Played a bit.
2992,one more turn
2993,"I was once told that if you find one game that you can play over and over, you will be set for life.  For me, this is that game."
2994,it ok
2995,This is the game that got me into the Civ series. Since then I've played each one with varying degrees of enjoyment. This was a great introduction to the series with some of the staple game components that are still used today in Civ 6.
2996,"The game itself is fine, but the implementation is so fucking buggy that even a five minute turn means hours of arguing with Steam and Windows to deal with all the damn crashes."
2997,Just wonderful!
2998,Top Game
2999,"the game is kinda fun I guess, yam saying"
3000,"good game

3003,Better than VI
3004,"My first steam game.
It was fun until Civ 6 came out."
3005,man i love civ
3006,yes
3007,Game is broken an unplayable on Windows 10. It will randomly crash for no reason during play. There is no known fix.
3008,Ghandi.
3009,"Many Civs to choose from, varying maps, scenarios & multiple ways to win. Extremely re-playable. I also like the interface better than 6."
3010,"Amazing! Better than Civ VI!

UPDATE: Warning, Windows 11 is stupid and doesn't support this game. Curse you, Microsoft!

00
 n"
3011,the best civ game in existance....all it needs is the mighty Ukrainian resistance unit
3012,"the Civ series is one of my favorite game series.

don't get too relaxed though you may miss click and nuc your own city trying to transplant a nuclear bomb to it because you were not paying attention and clicked the drop button.
"
3013,"This is the best game.
Just the best.
It is so addictive. 
Don't buy it if you value free time or want to achieve things in your life as it will consume you."
3014,Great
3015,Game doesnt even work on Win 11
3016,"If you can't beat me, don't even think about running for a government position.
Other than that, game on!"
3017,Its hard but fun.
3018,One the best evening clickers and sleep stealers
3019,"This game builds knowledge of human development from the earliest time while incorporating history, culture, and strategy education. It is fun to play alone or with friends, always competing with the other civilizations."
3020,1003 hours of gametime. in my opinion the best of all the turn based strategy games. easy to learn but there are always things to learn to improve your gameplay
3021,"There's nothing to be said, ya'll know it's a great game."
3022,I have enjoyed all the CIV games so far.
3023,better than VI
3024,"Best game I have ever played, would definitely recommend to anyone who likes strategy."
3025,"One of the best strategy games out there, if you are unsure like was give it a chance and you will not regret it."
3026,This is my favorite strategy game ever. I don't like that the price hasn't changed in the nearly decade that I've had it but my 1.66 thousand hours speak for themselves.
3027,I guess it is ok.
3028,Great game if you really feel like you sleep too much and would rather never do so again.
3029,gud
3030,"Civilization will always be fun. This game actually runs really well on my older computer, because when i tried 6 it was too much on my computer"
3031,A game that never gets old - even when playing alone. Playing this game alone is fantastic - but multiplayer is a new level of fun.
3032,9.9/10
3033,It game that play is able to completely win yes!
3034,Great game to check out even if you are not that into strategy. I'm usually not the strategy type of gamer but enjoy this game massively.
3035,"If at first you don't succeed, drop the difficulty and spam the Impiis.

The game is so addicting, I put down my heroin spoon to properly place my armies to fend off Egypt.

3043,"Fantastic game. one of the best strategy games of all time, especially if you like history. If torn between this and the sequel, Civilization 6, get this, its a far better game (although both are fantastic)"
3044,the last good civ game
3045,"cool i guess
"
3046,It was fun
3047,I don't really know what I'm doing but I enjoy it.
3048,"While I was very reluctant to move on from Civ IV I am so happy I did because this one managed to blow that amazing game out of the park. This game gave me so much joy even if I was rather mediocre at the game. I actually truly appreciate this games ability to make everything ""viable"" because I was able to win by simply making more money in more places than my opponents. This game Is addicting to the point I am scared whenever I get the itch to boot it up because I will spend all of the time I can trying to win until I just run out of time. However I have lots of trouble getting back into that campaign after the initial burst of massive amount of enjoyment."
3049,gr8 way to learn history
3050,Excellent Strategy Game
3051,"Very replayable

3056,SO much better than Civ6.
3057,Technical challenge and military history are big pluses.
3058,The best in the series in my opinion.
3059,"Yep, would 100% recommend the game, especially to  plastic face midget's that act like Dr. Evil."
3060,A good game to just dive into and enjoy
3061,good
3062,It's the tits!!
3063,"Best strategy game ever. Few bugs and balancing problems, but they can be easily fixed with mods."
3064,addictive
3065,My favorite Civ game!
3066,"Love playing with my friends even now, every game feels different and I enjoy how different it feels as I learn more."
3067,"Civilization 5 The Complete Game is one of my favorite games. With mods, it IS my favorite game. It's one of only a few other games I'd describe as having infinite replayability. Other reviews have already gotten into the details of it, so I'll focus on recommending how to get the most out of it.

Stage 1: Play it without mods. Start with a low difficulty setting and keep cranking up the difficulty until you reach a point that feels right for you, whether you want to be challenged or focus more on role-playing.

Stage 2: Play with all sorts of the amazing mods, which can be easily added through Steam Workshop.

Stage 3: Play with the Vox Populi overhaul mod. There can never be enough praise to heap on this massive mod. Nothing against Civilization 6, which I like, but Vox Populi is the true sequel to me. Plus, it's free."
3068,"Hey it's part of the Civ franchise, what's not to like"
3069,"I hate this game so much. Literally makes me wanna cease existence.

3076,Great game for someone who hates the eco system like me
3077,I Could Not Recommend this game More. My All time Favourite Game. But it's not Everyone's Cup of Tea. If you Don't like Turned Based game I Still suggest to try out this Game. Beyond Earth and VI Kinda Suck But this one Is Gold
3078,"Spent hundreds of hours playing with friends

Get Noquitters! Essential mod"
3079,Civ V is a lot of fun and improves on the old Civ 4 game.  The expansions really make this game feel new and add very interesting mechanics.
3080,Don't buy it. You'll spend 15 hours playing it in one sitting.
3081,"The ultimate Civ experience with the New Worlds expansion! The best in the franchise despite the few downsides!

9/10, easy!"
3082,uwu
3083,It's the best Civ game.
3084,Just one more turn.
3085,"I love this game, there is so much to discover!!"
3086,"Its okay, and I like the map being hex over square grid - that was a good upgrade. 

But it is very simplified compared to Civ4. The AI, Religion, Social Engineering, Trade, and Spying are all just more well fleshed out in 4."
3087,idk
3088,"I feel this is the most balanced of Civ games, without being overly complex. I have spent countless hours enjoying CIv 5, probably more than any other version."
3089,good
3090,good
3091,"great time waster
"
3092,there are alot of great mods to add to the game to make it more fun but the vanillas game difficulty settings are more of a way to define the AI's handicap or how much of an advantage they have over you rather then how aggressive they play atleast thats what i found when playing on higher difficultys
3093,Great game
3094,Its er....very good!
3095,Good strategy game
3096,best civ so far
3097,"If you're interested in a 4X strategy game, you've probably heard of the Civilization franchise. I haven't played every single entry but I have played both this and the latest one (at the time of writing it's Civilizations VI) and I don't know why I just keep coming back to this one.

Along with the brave new world and gods and king expansion packs, this game just feels so engaging. I've had countless of sleepless nights. Suffered from the just one more turn addiction, played plenty of matches in both singleplayer and multiplayer games, and watched tons of game plays from other people who are extremely skilled at the game just to learn a bit of their strategies. I'd say it's plenty worth it, tons of hours of entertainment at a decent price."
3098,Its a sick ass game lol
3099,this one'll keep ya playin
3100,"is good. be good at game get good
"
3101,"How the hell is this game 12 years old, never have i played a game that holds up perfectly in every single level, and the game-play loop, oh my god. You start a civilization in a randomly generated map, encounter other civilizations, and are given a choice, befriend them, or ruin their life in total physical and mental war as you throw everything you have at them to make their civilization extinct, or just take some land. And I didn't even talk about the civilization leaders that all have different traits for different play-styles. Amazing 7/7"

3109,"Best CIv after the 3rd. It lacks beauty of the 4th and I do miss the sale of the 3rd. But lategame war is especially cool with battleships, fighters, tanks and SAMs and logistics hell. The 6th has nothing on it. 
"
3110,"In King mode it is not possible to win. I am trying for last 2 years. I am loosing interest due to this.

3134,History and fum game play!
3135,"This is the sort of game you might only play 1-3 times a year, but when you do, you go on an absolute bender. Once you're playing, you're going to be ""Just one more turn""-ing until 5am for multiple weeks in a row."
3136,:)
3137,"""I even heard it was better than Civ 5 with the Brave New World expansion pack"" - Ice T

Anyone who has played this game knows that is incorrect."
3138,Ver gud
3139,"My version of solitaire.  Play the first 200 turns or so typically.  Less complex than Civ VI, so makes for a nice, short diversion."
3140,just play it
3141,pretty hot
3142,crack
3143,"Many people here seem to like this game for nostalgia reasons.

I think it is not bad for its time.

For disclosure I personally prefer Civ 6, tho this game doesn't seem to be bad either.

So I will tell you a little bit about it.

Graphics:
Awful if you jugde it by the standarts of 2022, decent if you judge it based on the time when it came out. (I think it was 2010) Tho I didn't play it when it came out, despite my classmates telling me to. I actually played this after Civ 6.

I like that the leaders have a little bit of a less colourful and less cartoon like look in this game than in Civ 6. I think it fits better. But everything else looks very meh.

So if you are the kind of person, to whom graphics are important play Civ 6 instead, but personally I think graphics don't really matter with this kind of game.

Gameplay:
I think when it comes to gameplay there are to major factors concerning this game. The sandbox/design factor and the strategy factor.
This is since the entire point of the civ franchise is to lead and build your own nation, in your own image.

Sandbox/Design:
Your options are a lot more limited here, than I would prefer.
You have some tech trees when it comes to, in which direction you want to go, but it is basically just upgrading a certain thing (for example faith) once in a while.
You also can choose some believes for your religion.
And you can search for the next best thing on the science tech tree.
In the end there will not be a lot of creativity when it comes to designing the characteristics of your own nation. Just follow the tech tree and that's it.

City building on the map, and farming ressources is nice.

But in both regards its successor civ 6 is better. In which you have better options when it comes to great persons, you can choose a certain amount of policies from a entire bunch of them, you have secret organications, religion is a bit more interesting, etc..

Strategy:
Now since this game is more limited in its options, there are obviously less strategies you can employ.
But it also makes it easier to anylise the situation and not just choose random things. Something which happens quite often in Civ 6.

Also the computer is probably a bit smarter than in civ 6, but I'm not sure.

Over all I would say the following, if you like to plan out your strategy in much detail, this game probably is better, since you want drive yourself completely insane, overanalysing every single option.

If you like to chose from a big set of options, following your instincs and going your own individual way, Civ 6 is probably the better option.

Speed:
People unfamiliar to the civ franchise will probably not know this, but it can be painstakenly slow, especially during the early game (First 50 turns). In this regard civ 5 is definetly worse than civ 6.

Price:
It's cheaper than Civ 6, but honestly you will need all the DLC's to make it worth while. And than it is about the same price.
To me personally Civ 6 without any DLC's is better than this one with all of them.

Music:
Ok, this isn't important, since you can simply switch it off and listen to something else in the backround instead. But I rather strangle my self, than listen to the in game music of civ 5 again.

Chad status:
You will get great respect from the internet, if you play this game instead of Civ 6.
Average Civ 5 enjoyer.

So if your not man enough to live without constant validation from strangers, here you can get it.

Resume:
I'm personally not a big fan of this game. I think it successor is much better and has much more options and things to do. But you can still enjoy this game. Maybe."
3144,"""One more turn"" - very detailed game (with played with all expansions). It draws you in and can lead to surprise all-nighters."
3145,"A classic piece of the genre. A must have for any turn-based strategy player.
Unlike Civ6, Civ5 does not have such fancy graphics, but this allows for running the game on much lower HW specs.
The amount of achievements is crazy, though. 235 hours in game and still around 50%."
3146,"The best Civilization, years playing."
3147,its a ok game but everything takes so long
3148,"Isn't a bad game, but for me, the graphics suffered the more you explored the map and definitely late game. Civ 6 is definitely better in this regard."
3149,goated.
3150,It's good
3151,Hell of a game!
3152,Play it. It's good.
3153,simulate ur dreams of getting more oil

3161,one of my favorite strategy game's
3162,"love love love this game jolly good time with my friends picking up twigs picking up twigs i like i like picking up twigs 1 twig 2 twig 3 twig 4, i like twigs and i want some more"
3163,"I've been playing Civ games for ever, and I love them. I actually think Civ V is the best version of all."

3168,its good
3169,its good
3170,i hart it
3171,Pretty fun! I like it
3172,"fun game, I jeft it on in the background"
3173,Civ V is quite the classic. One major way it departs from prior versions is through a 'Happiness' mechanism that can make rapid growth problematic. It's an interesting addition
3174,I like to play! (Garth Voice)
3175,Love this iteration of the Civ series.  Was the one that came the best naturally to me.
3176,"if I'm able to log 21 hours, not be to the present day, and still want to log back in then I think I can say that this game is good"
3177,"This game is refined digital Heroin. Once you start, you can't stop. Studying, work, it can all wait. After all, this is you last turn, right?

Right????"
3178,its CIV! AMAZING!!
3179,Has some depth.
3180,"Enjoyable, not worth the price tho."
3181,Great game. I've been playing CIV for years. One of my favorite games. This one has some updated features from CIV 3 and 4. Easy play.
3182,Fun and casual game that will eventually turn you into an war mongering leader
3183,yes
3184,.
3185,"one of the best games of all time but to this day civ5 will at some point start crashing and wont stop.
iv spent as much time trying to fix the crash problem as i have playing the game.
deleting specific files before launching helps for a short time, setting compatibility and changing dx versions sometimes helps but after years of playing tonight the game still crashes anytime i attack a ranged unity and thats after fixing another issue that was crashing the game on start up.

I dont understand how this was never resolved,

If you buy this be aware that its like a lottery, some people have no issues, other people cant play at all.

Changed to thumbs up since i bought a very expensive pc i haven't had one crash so i guess it depends on your pc even though the game came out in 2010."
3186,"One of the great games, shame you have to pay for expansions but well worth playing."
3187,Got nuked by Mahatma Ghandi 10/10
3188,"Hugely replayable, great with friends, and has a massive modding community. Simple to learn, very difficult to master, and allows for a wide variety of playstyles. For anyone even mildly interested in the strategy genre, this game is a must-have in your collection. 
Also as this game is quite old, it's very easy to pick up either a discounted key or find it on sale.

It's a classic!"
3189,.
3190,Very good game
3191,"Very good, enjoyable, varying levels of complexity."
3192,"This history-based game is GREAT, very fun!

It is so fun and so difficult to master. It is just difficult to defeat on the higher levels.

This game involves building your very own civilization. Now I don't play the 2 expansions (though I do have them) but I do play it otherwise. Here you build your civilization through culture, science, money, diplomacy and military. In fact, you can achieve each type of these victory. There are many ways to win.

You must maintain and build a modern military to conquer others and defend your own cities. But then the people are demanding a wonder of some type of a good/commodity. You must also take care of your money issues, grow your culture, and keep your people happy.

You can sometimes experience a ""great person"" like a Great Artist to appear to help your game.

The game is so good, so intelligent and with such great AI. Most of the games like strategy games I have played didn't have such a good AI. Yet here I ONLY play against the AI because it is so challenging. And even the soundtrack of this game is so good. The graphics at-the-time are quite great too. Overall, 5/5."
3193,so fucking good I wasted 1600 hours playing it. Would I do it again? absolutey
3194,great game
3195,Beats VI
3196,Civ 5? Hell yeah
3197,"Anti-Russian company that doesn't mind selling to evil countries like Israel and the USA, despite all of their constant war-mongering and genocide."
3198,Is good game. Play game to make Civilizations.
3199,This game is more stable than VI at least and is actually not a bad game.
3200,cameron is evil
3201,good
3202,"This game is 11 years old and still fun to play... I was generously gifted this a while back, and as a FPS player who has never played a RTS/strategy game before this one, it took many years of coming back to the game for my smooth brain to grasp the learning curve. Once I actually understood most of the game it became so enjoyable, but i'm still trying to figure out the little niches and big brain strategies. 10/10 

Definitely pick this game over Civ 6, the map is much more pleasing to look at than whatever tf they got going on over there.

3206,cool
3207,"This game still holds up well and can be a great time sink. All three victory styles can be fun but some are far easier than others to achieve. There is a bit of a learning curve to the game, but once you understand the mechanics of the gameplay systems and the quirks of your leader it can be a fun and challenging experience depending on your difficulty level. The multiplayer can also be a fun long game experience with friends where the host can load in scenarios for a continuous experience until someone achieves a victory."
3208,Awsome time waster

It's cool"
3210,still the best 4x game
3211,BEST GAME EVER MADE
3212,"What I liked about ""Sid Meier's Civilization V"" video game is that there isn't really a formula or strategy to an all out victory, meaning that you can play as a different world leader each time you log in, and as the game continues into the next era, you have to alter or progress your play style accordingly.  Also, every now and then Civ V adds new elements to an already existing good game."

3220,Hmm lets see.. Is it replayable? Oh god yes. Is it beautiful? Absolutely. Is it balanced? 100%. Is it the greatest game ever made? Without a doubt. Get all the DLCs they complete the game.
3221,The most fun thing you can do in this game is manipulate the AI into being friends with you so they forgive your various war crimes. Also I have no idea whats going on with Mr. Ghengis Khan but he is also really nice to me for some reason every game.

3277,"easy to learn, difficult to master, fun to play"
3278,BEST RTS
3279,"Play it, Enough said."
3280,"WHEN SID METZLER ANNOUNCED HIS FIFTH CENTIPEDE GAME I WAS SHOCKED. I DIDN""T EXPECT SEAN MURRAY WOULD DARE TO TRY AND TOP HIMSELF AFTER HE MADE CEREALIZATION 4 FIRST BLOOD PART TWO. THIS WAS REALLY SOMETHING THAT MADE ME FEEL LIKE SOMETHING INTERESTING WAS GOING TO HAPPEN. A TRULY UNPREDICTABLE AND REMARKABLE TIME TO LIVE IN. VERY INTERESTING. IT WAS PRETTY FUN, IF YOU ASK ME.

SO WHAT MAKES CIVILIZATION V SPECIAL?

LET ME KNOW IN THE COMMENTS …"
3281,good+fun
3282,fantastic game. never gets old to sit down and hammer out a 2-3 hour game where you get caught up in building your civ however you want. wanna take over the world? you can do that. wanna go to space? you can do that? wanna vote yourself in as world leader through boring diplomacy in the United Nations? you can do that. anything is possible in this game as long as youve got nukes and XCOM squads. buy it over civ 6 if you have the choice. you wont regret it.
3283,"Brilliant
"
3284,its fun to play
3285,The last great Civilization Game
3286,My friends like to beat the living crap out of me every time we play. I'm always really nice and just want to have a good time. For this reason I can only recommend this game to masochists and the clinically insane. fuck you Spencer.
3287,eaw
3288,"Fun, Death Robots"
3289,Challenging to master easy to learn
3290,Hours of fun!
3291,slap on some mods and enjoy
3292,"This is a great game, 10/10 best simulation game of the year"
3293,"Friend gave this as a gift. Good game, very engrossing, will eat your time without even realizing it."
3294,go at your own pace
3295,Issa gut game
3296,Great statigy game
3297,"Kinda 'maybe'. See, I've played Civ1 and was delighted - no wonder, the first game in the genre. Then all the others. Loved Civ1 (bit less Civ2 which is Civ1.2, in fact), loved 3, loved 4... Then everything changed.
Game mechanics. Graphics. You name it. I hated it - vanilla Civ5. Took me two expansions to 'accept' it. 
What's more, I accepted it more when Civ6 come out - it can be worse!
Conclusion:
If you're new to the franchise, you may like it just fine. It's a decent game.
If you're a bloody veteran, then 'perhaps'. I'm accepting it, and that's about it. Also, people at Civfanatics.com hated it so much, it took them few years to even include it in 'The Game of the Week' and so on. But they did, eventually.
So did I. Acceptable. Not great. But not the one I'll cut my wrists without, not the one I'll stay up whole night and get late for work.
And yet, no cartoon piece of... like 6... Australia as a civ? Really??? No offense to Australians, but actually needing to BUY that glorious civ? Never. I got mine as a part of HumbleBundle. And never liked it.
Hope 7 will be more 'old-skool'. In the meantime, this is the best Civ after the first four. Get it on sale, not otherwise. Still better than that moronic Alpha Centaury reimagine..."
3298,Addicting strategy game
3299,"Best version since Civ 1, CIV VI sucks"
3300,YES
3301,This game is a blast to play! You will take on different leaders as you try to beat other players. There is an online version of the game that you can play with friends! This game is awesome!!!  Oh yeah... and Actions have Consequences
3302,great game
3303,Best 4X game ever.
3304,"game, good."
3305,Graaaape
3306,Fun!!!
3307,"315 hours over past few years sneakily played with doctor job, wife and 2 little kids   that dedication is only possible with a true epic   love it"
3308,
3309,"very fun but time consuming, play this on a day you have some free time on."
3310,"very poggers and big brain game, def worth it"
3311,"Everyone has their preferences.  I've played every CIV, I prefer IV.

This would be good for a first time CIV player IMHO, it seems a bit streamlined compared to other versions.

I enjoy this one, but I'm probably going back to IV.

IMPORTANT: tooltips, icons, and important information is PUNY on high resolution systems.
It's headache or unplayable.  The game itself does not have user interface scaling.. for some people this could be an immediate deal breaker."
3312,"Very good game, it's aged well since it's release"
3313,Fun
3314,"good game, cus u can take over the world and that"
3315,a good civ game
3316,"Really good AI. Tough to beat at the higher levels. A lot of victory condition options, but some are more likely to succeed than others."
3317,i like this game because you can learn a lot of things from it.
3318,"Good game. With the Vox Populi modpack, it's still way better than Civ6."
3319,Fun for the fam
3320,It's a hands down gamer's staple. Great for wasting the day away or getting away from the hectic gamepace of modern games. I'm just waiting now for III and V to have a baby.
3321,"I read on kotaku that it's better than Civ 5 with the brave new world expansion pack...

Words by an elite gamer.

Buy Game -> Buy DLC -> Mod the hell out of it = Great game."
3322,"'Just one more turn' you keep telling yourself and before you know it time is way past 4 a.m. 

"
3323,Great Game
3324,digital cocaine
3325,"Has a great balance of simple / complex - if you want to fine-tune every detail of your strategy, you can; if you want to rely on the game's automations to drive some actions (so you don't have to worry about something overly complicated), you can also do that reliably. Helps get you started quickly and allow for simpler gameplay if you're not in the mood for something really intense."
3326,I have school work to do... please send help
3327,This is by far the newest/QUALITY Civ game out right now... I honestly am not a fan of 6.... just my opinion.
3328,Is fun!
3329,The World has never seen a game as good as this one!
3330,Tom hates it
3331,I love the game it is very fun.
3332,highly recommended One of the best game I've played all time .
3333,Best game ever

But be careful, it eats up time fast"
3336,good

3339,The game was fun!
3340,brilliant

3342,Still my favorite Civ.
3343,good game

3346,Good game
3347,good game

3349,Pinnacle of Civ games
3350,"""lmao guys why is gandhi researching the manhattan project?"""
3351,srj
3352,I would highly recommend! I will say i hope they make Civ 7 more like this game? This game has way more depth then 6 and another detail i would like them to add is more empire related units like for example the Germans have panzers i say also add U boats and 88s for artillery and heinkel bombers like civ rev?
3353,The best CIV game
3354,"yup
"
3355,It makes addiction.
3356,"Game refuses to launch in full screen. Even after adjusting the settings. This is fucking unacceptable for a game that has been out this long to still have issues like this. maybe if they fixed their shit i could actually play the game, and this is the ONLY game that does this. Dont waste your money on a game that doesnt work
"
3357,like its own genre
3358,GUD
3359,yes
3360,"It's Civ, if you like Civ you'll like this

Honestly just get this one instead of 6"
3361,is good i will win thanks
3362,I like this
3363,i havent played much but im really enjoying this one
3364,ye
3365,"As you can tell by my hours, days, and weeks invested in this game. Its definitely recommended easily the best game of the series."
3366,The game play is perfect for me.
3367,"i have never reached the information era, 10/10"
3368,Easily the best game to ever come out.  Played since I was seven and still playing it now. 11/10
3369,GG
3370,"f
"
3371,"8/10 for me on buying this.

I would give this game a 10/10 but I didn't buy it till Civilization VI came out due wanting all of the garbage DLC they kept on making that doesn't really add anything to the game as a whole but it always feels like the game isn't complete with out all of the garbage DLC...

I don't recommend buying games like this until they stop making garbage DLC that they charge you for and it all goes on sale like a golden dumpster fire rolling down the street with flaming rats exploding out of every rusted out hole and for some reason your brain goes ""I would like that glorious looking dumpster fire over there""...

Other then the DLC issue, the game is solid, and I would recommend buying it if you like conquest board games. Because that's what this series is, a conquest board game with better graphics."
3372,nice
3373,where is civ 7?
3374,Game good
3375,It's a great little time dispenser.  The DLC and mods are interesting too.
3376,I upgraded to windows 11 and now I cant load the game to play.  any help would be great
3377,Great game :)
3378,good
3379,Better than civ 6 in almost every way
3380,"fun, easier version of hoi4"
3381,Yes
3382,"Ability to have different land, opponents, etc."
3383,Can't go wrong with dominating the world. Also a great study tool for Western Civ.
3384,I like it.
3385,Great game!
3386,"make sure u get this game via the [url=https://www.humblebundle.com/games/sid-meiers-ultimate-collection?hmb_source=&hmb_medium=product_tile&hmb_campaign=mosaic_section_1_layout_index_1_layout_type_threes_tile_index_1_c_sidmeiersultimatecollection_bundle] sid meier's ultimate collection humble bundle [/url]

it's worth it solely for this game but the others are a bonus :steamthumbsup:"
3387,    This game will keep you going for hours. Detailed planning for defense and controlled but there are many many upgrades that delay advancement. A great step up if you like the Rise of Nations games.
3388,Sanctions aren't gonna stop Russia
3389,I JUST GOT RID OF THAT BARB CAMP WHYS IT BACK
3390,"Bip bop time to take over a lot.
Civ 5 is amazing, Perfect for anyone. 
PERFECT.
If you dont want to sell whats left of your sanity and soul, this is a good alternative to Civ 6."
3391,Yes!
3392,"The first game I ever bought to get into PC gaming. Bought when it released in 2010. Played over 1000hrs on my old steam account and when I lost that one it was the first game I bought for this account. Now with another 700+ hrs on this account, this is by far my most played and favourite game of all time. I recommend to anybody who enjoys grand strategy games, is a fan of the Civ series.

I would like to see the next Civ game come back to this style of play, and move away from the districts of Civ 6. Lots of good reviews online, but when talking to friends and other fans, we all agree this was the best Civ ever.... Why stray away from it??

BRING BACK CIV 5 AND ADD THE BEST FEATURES FROM BOTH 5 AND 6 PLEASE, NO MORE DISTRICTS

We need WORKERS NOT BUILDERS PLEASE!!!"
3393,It's great!
3394,It's Civ.
3395,Good Game!
3396,!! !! !!! !!
3397,"spent 9 hours on the game today, i only bought it today, the arabs wouldnt leave me alone and france are just pure d1cks, 10000/10000 i will become supreme leader of the world next time and stop putin from being born"
3398,CIVILIZATION GO BRRR I BUY OUT THE CITY STATES GO BRRRR
3399,Excellent game
3400,"It's such a good strategy game!

10/10 would recommend"
3401,good
3402,i have 500 hours in this game for a reason
3403,"Countless replay value even though there is a new version of the game and also older, every single Civ game has been tremendous in this respect. 10/10 still playing in 2022"
3404,What an incredible turn-based strategy game! A Must-have if you like turn based games!
3405,V is best. VI avoid
3406,play with nq mods
3407,"Entertaining, love the variations."
3408,Once installed it never updates... it will say 6 files faild to load.
3409,
3410,The game is okay I guess.
3411,"Wasn't sure if I'd like this type of game at first, but I ended up staying up countless nights telling myself ""just one more turn"". Definitely would recommend."
3412,This is a classic. Learn the game and you will have a blast.
3413,"Best Sid Meier's game built thus far.  Out of all the games in the series, this would be the one I recommend you buy.

Negatives:  1. It appears that this game is not receiving much if ANY support from the makers at this point.  This has to do with them not keeping up with updates or Microsoft constantly trying to end support of older software.  2. Empires and civilizations tended to be happier when they grew larger, more powerful, and yet, for what ever reason, the game makers in their infinite ""wisdom"" made civilizations increasingly unhappy.  This can be fixed by a MOD, but it does break the game.  3.  It does not matter for how long you are at peace, the warmonger status will not go away.  True, they have a way to decrease your warmonger status by liberating cities, but this does not work that well.  

Positives: 1. If you are playing this game on a Windows 7 PC, this game plays flawlessly.  2. There are a TON of mods that are being routinely updated.  3.  You can run mods which will fix the stupid ""features"" that were built into the game.  4. You can play a TON of games and have each one be unique.

I HIGHLY recommend buying this game if you like turn based strategy games."
3414,One of the best strategy games.
3415,The Best Version of Civ so far.
3416,Better than Civ VI
3417,I've spent way too much time playing this game
3418,Just one more turn
3419,It's ok I guess
3420,"A masterpiece of a strategy game. Every time you play, you tell your own story, and mods make the game go on for even longer. Desyncing happens frequently on multiplayer games unfortunately, but it's only been catastrophic a handful of times. 

10/10 game, and there's only a handful of games I would include in that category."
3421,"Its nice
"
3422,Its good
3423,"This game is bonkers fun. It needs a good warning though, you may spend hundreds of hours with this title."
3424,ye is good
3425,good
3426,"This is in my opinion the single best civilization game ever published, and the most fun I have had in a turn based strategy game."
3427,civ 5
3428,"Sweet game, I loved Civ 2, did not like CIV 3 or 4 - but Civ 5 is really good.  Only thing I wish it had was the option to play the background music from CIV 2."
3429,Best civ game so far.
3430,Good. Fun.
3431,"Best of the Civilization games.   The right amount of strategic decisions to make - enough to make it challenging, but not too much where it becomes overly complicated.  Even better with Brave New World and Gods and Kings expansion packs.  Lots of playing options and victory conditions to choose from.  Lots of fun, although games are lengthy."
3432,Me & my friends have put hundreds of hours in this game and we still to this day haven't completed a game.
3433,good
3434,"great strategy game
easy to learn"
3435,Civ V > Civ VI
3436,Interesting game; plenty of variation; allows for a learning curve.
3437,it's good
3438,"[h1] 10/10; the most addictive game I've ever played yet! [/h1]
""Just one more turn"" while its 3 am."
3439,"I like Civ 5 for those days when I want to play a game, not have another job (civ 6 for those days)."
3440,Wonderful game! <3
3441,Very addictive gameplay
3442,it's ok
3443,love it
3444,Just play it. Your welcome.
3445,fun to play w/ friends
3446,nh
3447,Petachip
3448,very taxing graphics wise.. but soo worth it ..  great game single player or multiplayer
3449,i
3450,This is a game you find yourself coming back to time and again. Worth the purchase.
3451,Still like this version better than version 6.
3452,good
3453,I played for 1500 hours and I can assure you this game is horrible
3454,"Great time filler, solid all  around."
3455,"Very fun, only downside is that you have to buy like 20 DLC/expansions to have the full game. The base game is still really good."
3456,It's Civ V
3457,"Complicated, but still simple enough to use intuition rather than a calculator. Good balance of fun and strategy!"
3458,WW3
3459,Love the game and all the challengers and challenging situations that comes with it
3460,BEST GAME EVERRR!!!!!
3461,good
3462,Amazing game
3463,"The best civ game of all time!
"
3464,I don't really like it much
3465,Best of the series.
3466,"I am a big Civ Fan, but I got into this version only after the first few updates were out as I still enjoyed playing Civ 4 and the reviews for this one were mixed. But when I got it I must say it's great. Awesome Civs with awesome unique abilities and units. I enjoy playing as Austria a lot and even though I also own Civ 6 in the meantime I always return to this version to play."
3467,its alright i guess
3468,fucvk this
3469,Want some time to kill? This game is for you.
3470,very good game
3471,this is what makes the independence of america so horrible today i come.
3472,Warning: Dangerously addictive game. You'll never stop playing.
3473,"Once a campaign has got you hooked, you will forget sleeping, working, eating for 70 hours straight"
3474,gg
3475,The Goat
3476,"The base game is good, modding it is awesome."
3477,A classic and must-have!
3478,wanna past time and skip time play this game
3479,Play time says it all.
3480,Do you want something that took 1300 (and counting) hours away from your life without blinking? Well this is it. Enjoy not having a life but instead just insisting at 1:30am on a workday that just one more turn (really 20) and you'll really be able to stick it to Queen Isabella of Spain.  Easily the best and worst decision I have ever made.
3481,Computer AI is capable opponent

3497,The multiplayer in this game is the most infuriatingly broken piece of shit I've ever had the displeasure of enduring. Sid Meier can eat a dick. Do NOT buy this if you want to play with friends. Go outside and smush your balls into an anthill for a more enjoyable experience.
3498,a whole lot better than Civ VI
3499,sesdfdsf
3500,Should be a must have in your Steam library.
3501,crack cocaine.
3502,Very good game.
3503,One of the best turn-based strategy games. Combat is interesting and fun and there are many different forms of advancement if politics or science sounds more interesting.
3504,"Look, this game has sucked my soul for  a half year of in game time. I just found out there was a thing called Corona. Please play with caution, I may have inadvertently caused the whole Russian war issue that is currently going on. I'm too immersed! If you have read this far, I'm sorry it has a hold on you too."

3510,"2022 review : CIV5 is unplayable now ! just go play civ6 ! this game is DEAD !
===
 all the DLCs of this game should become free and part of the main game !!!
after playing a lot of civ6 i came and gave a run at the old civ5 and it looks bad, it looks dead to me !
i mean this game came out 2010 ! that's 12 years ago ! the game looks, plays and feels awful now.
you don't see the buildings you build, the grid and textures are just pictures and most of stuff are 2D and not 3D !
i mean when playing this game i felt like it hurt my eyes, it looks so awful, old and bad.
the only thing good about this game that i remember is that the Ai is much better than civ6, civ6 almost has no ai !
---
i played civ5 for so many hours when it came out, then after a year or 2 i bought it on steam and i had a few runs on steam too and i enjoyed it, but now it is unplayable, it is like after you live in a 2 bedroom house, you can't live in a 1 bedroom house, the same way, after playing civ6, civ5 is unplayable !
but i remember i had many great runs in civ5 where i made planes then ai made anti air guns, and etc etc etc,,,
but in civ6 as good as it looks, the ai does nothing, builds no anti air units whatsoever, never attacks you unless he has twice the power of your military+, the ai in civ6 sucks but the game looks so good.
===
i will give this game : 9/10 ! (if we were talking back then).
i will give this game : 5/10 now at the year 2022 !

Really fun if you got the time."
3513,Best CIV ever.
3514,Is good
3515,"This game is simply awesome. I was first introduced to this game by my father, at the age of 9. Ever since then, I followed the Civilization Games."
3516,i have enjoyed murdering other civs because i am so much better
3517,One of my favorites to unwind and loose track of hours/days. Hopefully Civ 7 is more like 5
3518,"there was this one time there was this guy named daybreaker and he nuked me and then i cired. also only plays russia, also also he keeps leaving little love notes at my door in cursive, i cant read it though, is it another language? plz respond if u can"
3519,"There is too much content to appreciate the whole game lot unless you play it regularly for a good amount of time. It is more dry than it;s content. EU4 does a lot more with less content. But I LIKE the CIV5 content. Civ 6 is ridiculous - it is boring compared to Civ 5. EUIV has so much experimentation variety with less content. You have to think of food and production and gold all the time with even interesting content features. They are just labels for these! EUIV you can do real world province and country management with far less! Making it more cohesive. Civ also could do with either icons or 3d models but not a mixture or lack of one or the other. It is very clumsy. But I like it. I am NOT a spoilt brat like the Scottish think I am - they are, not myself. How unfortunate they won't listen and refuse to change."

3522,With Vox Populi mod (Community Patch Project) definitely the best Civilization type game on the market.

3524,Fantastic game for single player. Multiplayer is terrible. Someone should be really embarrassed for releasing a turn based multiplayer game that either does not work at all or is totally unreliable if by some miracle you manage to connect to other players. Do not buy if you are looking for a multiplayer game.

3537,It's just out of date in a pure technical aspect. There are mods to alleviate most of the issues but you can only play singleplayer with mods enabled. Can't recommend it anymore.

3542,"Haven't played much Civ, but this one is really good."
3543,It's great
3544,"I started with Civ VI and will probably always be biased towards that game, but Civ V really ain't bad. 
I do think V's approach when it comes to policies is very interesting, but it's far less fleshed out and impactful as what you see in VI. The idea of having a smaller tree is nice, but I much prefer VI's policies that allow for a more flexible style with a mix between the several 'currencies', while also offering you the opportunity to focus on one single currency, maybe two.
The scientific tree isn't bad, but the amount of buildings you get to build feels very limited in comparison. I also enjoy the district approach far more to just plastering your land with improvements everywhere, even if building mining areas and large fields is very satisfying thanks to V's superior look. It's more realistic and less bright, but that issue can be solved in VI easily by installing a mod.
Wonders are something I am divided on. I do like seeing the wonders on a smaller scale, spread across your territory... but seeing the Oracle of Pyramids in the middle of a crop field is a bit silly. VI really makes you feel like you build something grandiose, not only due to the size of wonders, but also the decor that a wonder comes with, while V integrates the wonder far better into your city. 
Combat is a bit lackluster here. It feels less refined than it is in VI. I do like that promotions don't necessarily heal your unit when you promote, which makes the choice more impactful. Do you heal to inflict more damage/save your unit, or can you promote for more damage on flat ground, but at the cost of losing your unit because you can't pull back in time?
What VI does faaar better than V are the leader abilities and unique units/improvements. Some leaders in V have a dreadful ability that gives no real advantage whatsoever, and its their only ability too. VI sees leaders with at least two abilities, one major ability and one that's less strong, or two that are insanely strong together.

I still recommend anyone to play both. They're great games in their own right. If a Civ VII ever comes into existence, taking elements from V and VI, while also improving on them and adding new interesting mechanics, could make for an absolutely amazing game."

3558,"As kind of a noob when it  comes to strategy games, it has quite the learning curve but the abundance on features also means it has extreme replayability. I have started a new game a few times already because I learned some important lessons, either by 'doing it wrong' or by getting good tips, tricks and other advice on youtube of CIV 5 wiki's. And now I'm actually getting a bit better, I'm sure I will have many many hours worth of fun with it.

I feel like that no matter how many times I play a match that I still get a lot of enjoyment out of of a match.
This is a really good idle game for when I want to play something on the side while I do homework and want the occasional break to take my turn every few minutes.
I like Civ 6 too, but I do think that Civ 5 still manages to be my favorite."
3571,"Was a great game for 10 years, then some intern decided it was a good idea to force-feed a useless third party launcher into it that makes the game unable to launch.

3574,"Civilization 5 Brave New World is an epic scale strategy game encompassing international competition in military, but also economic, diplomatic, cultural, exploration, engineering, religious, and technology realms. You're in the role of a statesman / general, not the role of warrior. If you like to master games at this scale, this is the best one on the planet. It's a game you can focus your attention on for months / years, or, still enjoy playing with a short attention span. It is also far better than Civ6, which has failed humanity, destroyed expectations,  and brought despair. (At this point I've played 4000 hours?)"

Other than that game sucks, graphics are not cartoon styled the military unit construction time is terrible, seriously if imma make a trebuchet imma use muh trebuchet even though (depending on your game pace) I might have just finished researching cannons....Also nerf japan seriously way of Bushido does not need to apply to Modern Era units, just stop."

This is good and nice strategy game giving a lot of possibilities to create and lead their own civilization to victory. I can't compare it to Civ 4,3,2,1 like others, but what I got was a varied turn-based strategy game that was a lot of fun."
3613,"This timeless classic is made even better for Civ V, yes even better than VI. But, it's only for mature and responsible individuals who can limit the addictiveness of ""one more turn"" to literally just only one more turn. Godspeed! May the odds and your skill ever be in your favor."

3621,"if you're new to turn-based strategy games and interested in the civilization franchise, i recommend this game. the full version is often available for little money and the investment is worth it. the mechanics are easy to grasp and overall the gameplay is simpler than civ6. you don't need that much background knowledge and time to get in and enjoy the game. playing civ5 with a friend also helped me a lot to get better at civ6. nevertheless, the game is a lot of fun. what I particularly like is that the civilizations play very differently and there's always a subtle learning about history if you're interested in that. the soundtrack is also good and creates a great atmosphere. all in all a real recommendation."
3622,"It's like monopoly, but online. Watch as your friendships crumble before your very eyes."
3623,"First time playing, got sucked in for 14 hours straight. I get it now."

3640,It's OK.
3641,"I've always heard it said how addicting this game is. Boy, they ain't lying. Civilization V is fully aware of how addicting it is. You'll be begging for one more turn like a crack addict begging for one more fix.

Civilization V is deep. Like, deeper than yo momma's p**y deep. There are so many ways to play and so many ways to win and so many ways to lose it's mind boggling. From the plethora of civilizations to play as and against, to the number of victory conditions and the sheer number of ways to get there, to the sheer number of map compositions and ways to set up a match, you could play a hundred games and no two would seem even remotely alike. The sheer immense wonder of being able to simulate your civilization's rise through the ages offers up endless possibilities.

And don't think the game will let you catch any slack either. Civ V has one of the most advanced opponent AI I've ever seen in a video game. On the basic difficulty settings, the AI is a pushover. It will mostly cooperate with you and only become distant if you start warmongering. It will seldom outright attack you. The worst you'll ever have to contend with is it making a play to conquer a city state that you're particularly fond of (or one you want to conquer yourself). If you pick a fight with another civilization, however, they're easily  beaten.

But once you start ramping up the difficulty settings... watch out. The opponent AI becomes absolutely merciless. It will eat your lunch and then eat you for lunch. It's smart. Scary smart. It's like, how in the world hasn't it already conquered the real world yet smart. The sheer number of ways in which the AI will kick your @$$ is astounding. Fortunately for you, you have all of the same methods at your disposal. So you only have yourself to blame for your civilization being stomped by the AI and brushed aside into the dustbin of history.

So if you're more than up for the challenge, the computer is more than up to give it to you.

But if you'd rather match wits against a more human opponent, multiplayer has you covered. It's as comprehensive a multiplayer as you can get, with every player manning their civilization on the same map with or without AI to play against.

Graphically, the game looks decent. Good for its time and it holds up well enough compared to today. I wouldn't say that Civ V couldn't stand to have a HD facelift, with better lighting and textures. The lighting effect options are disabled for me, however, for some reason. 

Another odd thing the game does is minimize itself when I delete saved games. This is the only time it does it. The confirmation window pops up for a second before it minimizes, but when I open the game window again, it's gone. Strange behavior. But not really a problem. The game doesn't crash and the files are deleted as intended. It's just weird.

In all my 60 hours of play as of this review, I've only had one crash... or something like it. The game didn't really crash. It didn't even hang. The screen just went completely black and everything stopped responding. Everything. Ctrl Alt Del wouldn't register. At first I thought it was a problem with my monitor but I checked and that wasn't the case. Nothing that a simple restart couldn't handle. But it was an odd occurrence, and so far the only time it has happened. I can't even really confirm if the game was to fault.

Other than that, my only real complaint is how the camera jumps around the map to automatically center on each city and unit as its turn comes up. I'm not overly prone to motion sickness but I'm as vulnerable to it as anyone, and the constant shifting makes me ill after hours of play. It would be nice if there were an option to disable this behavior. In general, it would be nice to have a lot of options for a lot of things. But the options menu is fairly scant.

I also wish that the camera could zoom in closer. There is a lot of rich detail in the units and terrain. Watching your cities change with unique visual features as you add new buildings and wonders and advance through the ages is satisfying. But you can't zoom the camera in close enough to really appreciate it.

Pros
+More Addicting Than Crack
+Deep Deep Super Insanely Mindboggelingly Deep Mechanically Rich Gameplay
+Multiplayer Multiplayer Multiplayer
+Crazy Sophisticated Opponent AI
+Stable, Game Runs Great. I Only Had One Bizarre ""Crash"" But It Otherwise Runs Like A Dream
+Graphics Hold Up Well, Nice Little Artistic Details Here And There

Cons
-Camera Jumping Will Give Even The Most Hardened Fighter Pilot A Migraine
-Less Options In The Options Menu Than I Would Like
-Lighting Options Are Disabled For Some Reason (May Not Affect Everyone)
-Would Be Nice If The Camera Could Zoom In Closer

Overall, Civilization V is a game for the ages. If you're even remotely interested in 4X, strategy, board games, or anything similar, Civ V is the game to play."

3653,"This game doesn't really need another review and I really can't think of anything to say about Civ 5 that hasn't been already said, but I felt I had to post something about the game that has now taken nearly 3,000 hours of my life. I've looked at Civ 6 - it sounds cool, but the graphics looks cheesy in comparison. I'll wait for Civ 7. The terrain and unit graphics in Civ 5 are just amazing, I never get tired of looking at the scenery. 

My only complaint with the game is how land units morph into naval transports automatically when moving onto a water tile. It just doesn't feel right. I actually enjoyed loading up transports with units in Civ 3 to create an invasion force. I wish they would change it back."
3654,Tis good
3655,Great !

3665,great game if you like turn based strategy and war
3666,"I am sorry to say, I am not a fan of Civ V. 

I have played all the previous Civ instalments over an estimated 25 year period and enjoyed each one immensely. However, I find Civ V to be a ponderous and badly designed game. Visually,  the screen feels cluttered and messy, a chore for the eyes and the mind to scroll around. The GUI feels slow and clunky, so that I feel like I'm being dragged around the various turn options rather than being in full control. The gameplay doesn't engage me at all. Civ V seems to have lost the charm of previous iterations of the Civ series. I don't know what it is, I just feel the designers got it all wrong on this one which is a great shame as I really wanted it to work for me."
3667,The hours speak for themselves. Play with the Vox Populi mod of course.
3668,"very nice
"
3669,Very Fun.
3670,"1335 hours at time of review... well i can at the very least say it is worth every penny at any price you pay. the expansions are nice, it's an easy game to just pick up and play for a while save for another day or if you are a heathen like myself and many others you play just one more turn."

Uninstalled/reinstalled it and can't figure it out. Loved the game previously. Played a ton offline when I was home for holidays from college. Really unfortunate.

3734,"I am by no means any good at strategy games, but Civ V is even fun without having any idea how to masterfully play one on the lower difficulties. 

In my opinion more interesting than Civ VI, which I couldn't get myself to play for a longer time.

The different countries & leaders offer different strategic approaches and focusses, giving you the ability to plan for a goal you want to reach.
Workshop Support also allows you to add even more scenarios, maps and leaders.

Multiplayer Support is included, but I haven't played too much of it, so I can't make any comments on it.

3751,"I've always loved civ games, and this is no exception, however, I'm rather disgruntled that most of the time my game quits to desk top when trying to load or re-load a saved game, unless I leave the computer on constantly, and I can't afford to make a mistake. This problem tends to occur later in the game, the more cities, the bigger the territories, the more cultivated the land etc, I have a rather high spec gaming PC with decent hardware and powerful graphics card, and this is the only game I've had probs with so far. So it's really off putting when this happens, since as most players will attest, you can put a lot of your time into a game, but if for any reason the PC has to be switched off or re booted, I frequently find I can no longer continue and that's maddening. I make multiple different game saves to try to combat this, but I find myself often repeating the same steps and decisions and I'm beginning to find the game unplayable. Furthermore, the game takes forever and an age to load and that includes launching the game, other times when games have successfully loaded, I've found that terrain improvements I have made have disappeared, and while I don't dispute the merits of the game itself with other reviews posted, I cannot, in good conscience recommend the game to others until these types of glitches are fixed, which I feel is a monumental shame considering the overwhelmingly positive reviews I've read."
3752,"The best turn-based strategy game I've ever played. 

There are a few imbalances (e.g. all civs denouncing and/or declaring war with you at the same time), but, compared to this game's overall magnificence, they're insignificant."
3753,Better Ingredients. Better Pizza. Papa John's.
3754,You know.
3755,I love playing this game all by myself. It keeps me attentive and busy instead of just watching TV or similar stuff.
3756,"this game is rad, I'm not claiming its super balanced, and i've heard online play is a headache sometimes, but I really have no interest in civ 6 because to me, this is the ideal civ game"
3757,One of the best games of strats. Highly recommend! this was my first video game I owned. Best game!!!!!!!
3758,The best installation of Civilization in the entire series-- by far.
3759,"I have played this game for years, sometimes even with other people. Really great way to waste entire days away, one of my favourite games of all time. I refuse to move on to any new iterations."
3760,good
3761,I LOVE IT
3762,"One of the best Civ games, and a great game overall.  Infinite replayability, even in single player."
3763,"neeto
"
3764,best civ game
3765,.
3766,👍
3767,Very in dept simulation geme.
3768,"I have put in about 1200 hours in this game, it never gets old. Multiplayer sessions are kind of hard to do because of how long one game can get, but it still is a bunch of fun with friends. Solo is probably how most players play this and can get really interesting if you find the right mods. If you are going to get this game Id recommend getting the expansions too, the game just plays better that way imo."
3769,"Great game, better than VI"
3770,"""Just another turn"" ... oh it is already past midnight? Damn it got me again…

As already a lot of other players mentioned this game is really reaaaaallllly addictive. You play it again and again. Have a lot of fun. Than you try another civ or map and it hits you again.

Every session you learn something new. Even after 100+ hours.

Finally after it gets a bit stale and repetitive you figure out there are tons of mods available through steams workshop. Some of them are still updated until this day! You install one or two to try them out and… “Just another turn”… Where did my weekend go again?"
3771,"This game is fantastic. Great single-player experience, lots of modifiers and different playable civilisations. Replayability is top marks but the multiplayer stability is pretty inconsistent."
3772,"I about to finish my first round soon, so much fun! 

Its like Settlers of Cartan on steroids, only the KI could be better (just increases the stats for economy in harder difficulty)"
3773,Very gut.Very much modable and based.
3774,best strategy game I've ever played :)
3775,"As I have just reviewed Civilization 6, it's only fair I do the same for Civilization 5. This game was my introduction to turn-based games and to this franchise. Definitely a game worth trying, both Civlization 5 and 6."
3776,"Shoshone OP, fun game to kill some time with"
3777,"I mean, it's a civ game. You either love them or you don't."
3778,"I like the sense of discovery with each new map, and I like the sense of following a functional pattern - or varying it to try new ways of reaching the same goal. It's not actually a sandbox, but it has elements of the sandbox within the overall story. And being attacked by Gandhi with atomics is an utterly surreal experience..."
3779,good game
3780,My favorite version of Civ. Great game.
3781,addicting
3782,so much better than VI
3783,"I've been playing this game since the day it came out, and when I tell you that it is my favorite game of all time (in close contest with Minecraft) I am not exaggerating. With Gods and Kings and Brave New World, it's worth a try."
3784,"fantastic, great strategy game"
3785,Best Civ ever
3786,Works on Linux. It's my favorite game. I play it drunk with my friends sometimes.
3787,The most fun I had playing this game was with friends
3788,"Best in the franchise, skip Civ 6, and just play this instead, you will love it."
3789,Almost 600 hours well spent!
3790,Extremamente viciante. Tome cuidado!
3791,best game ever
3792,IT FUN
3793,Great game - thought provoking and engaging.
3794,depth in content
3795,good for fans of the franchise
3796,Great game with excellent classic civ gameplay
3797,Excellent Civ game!
3798,"  If you liked Age of Empires, or Age of Mythology, then you will probably enjoy Sid Meier's Civilization V.  It's about building your own Civilization Empire and surviving the other Empire Leaders and their designs."
3799,"AI, if you player, you know."
3800,"After countless hours of conquest, scientific domination, cultural annihilation, religious fervor, and the often undiplomatic diplomacy victories stolen from the jaws of Brazil and their 458th Carnival. This is easily one of my all time favorite games and I still find myself coming back to it now. It's a relatively easy game to learn once you get into it, though it will take many hours to master. The infinite re-playability of this game can lead to some amusing AI mishaps and hilarious or tense interactions with friends. If you're in the market for a 4X game with simplicity, this is probably the easiest one to get into and understand the mechanics. Overall, Civilization 5 has stuck with me through the years and even with Civilization 6 this game still manages to pull me back in for just one more foray into a world yet unknown, time and time again."
3801,"best civ game, use mods for more fair multiplayer"
3802,Best Civ game
3803,Great Game.

3809,"When I was little, my mom would only allow me to have educational games unless I bought them with my own money. Dad managed to convince Mom that the civ franchise was educational and thus, I was raised on this game. To be fair, I did learn about some of the monuments and leaders and so on because Mom would pop by occasionally to make sure I was learning. Anyway, the Civ franchise is my childhood and I am glad my Dad got me into it. Although, I do not think you should let a five year old play these like my dad did. Pretty sure that's how the world was gifted with such lovely folks as Kim Jong Un and Josef Stalin"
3810,ITS GOOODDDDDDD
3811,The only game where Babylonian Death Robots can fight Aztec fighter planes. 10/10
3812,cool
3813,"Amazing game -- over 2,000 hours played, mostly hot seat with my family. So many great memories built -- and epic scenarios. Masterpiece."
3814,"Great range of choices to tweak the experience.  I like naval type competitions on huge worlds.
"
3815,Hours of fun
3816,Great game. Takes some elbow grease to get off the ground and it's so worth it.
3817,"Classic, one of my favorites of the Franchise."
3818,Civ is always so fun
3819,good game
3820,"This game can turn fast-forward time, I swear"
3821,"It's good. Some features not like freeciv, but has nice multimedia"
3822,Pirates
3823, are you joking? you've never played this?!?!?! GET IT NOW AND PLAY IT WITH YOUR FRIENDS
3824,couldn't be more sad at the state of gaming first off id like to say this game could be a challenge to a child or someone severely disabled but for me this is just a snore fest took me 3 hours to figure out my IQ is far too high for this trash.
3825,Playing this game allows me to indulge my fantasies of being a dictator and conquering the world.  Overall not much to complain about.
3826,fun
3827,"It's a fun game, 10/10 would recommend."

3834,best game ever civ 6 trash
3835,I got Civ 3 when I was a youngin' and this is such an upgrade. Been enjoying all the different and new features within this one.
3836,Great Game!
3837,Addicticting and varied content. Best with gods & kings mod pack
3838,Good
3839,"I mean, it's Civ 5?"
3840,cool game
3841,yese
3842,"Extremely entertaining and dangerously addictive. Endless fun, with or without mods. Highly recommend."
3843,The best of all current Civ games (incl compared to VI)
3844,this game should simply be called barbarion defense with some rts features. fuck this crap.
3845,Something to past the time and relax
3846,It's ok I guess.
3847,rtrttga
3848,awesome!

3851,greatest turn based strategy game of all time. easily top ten for greatest video game of all time.
3852,Golid Same.
3853,It's my favorite game. I can't get into the new ones or the old ones. Just Civ 5. Love it.
3854,Great game. Spend WAY too many hours on this.
3855,perkeleen gandhi voittaa koko ajan
3856,Solid game
3857,"Coming up on 750 hours, of course I recommend it"
3858,"What a great game, very addicting even though I lose most of the time. Every play through I learn something new about the game, even in the early game."
3859,"Best if you have nothing to do the entire day
"
3860,solid game
3861,Will lose many hours to playing just one more turn.
3862,"Damn. 
I just cringed. 
Really hard. 

Anyway play civ it's fun."
3863,better than 6
3864,its so good but this game will consume your life. i lost my wife and kids due to this game.
3865,"I absolutely love this game, it never gets old and can be played over several days or long sittings depending on your time. The strategy changes you can employ depending on who you pick to play as are always varying and it's just a lot of fun!"
3866,Great Library go brrr
3867,No pasa de moda
3868,ITS JUST GOOD. GET IT.
3869,guns are powerful in this
3870,Really quite a nice way to kill 14 hours.
3871,"How do you like them apples, Gandhi?"
3872,"For a game that 2k seems to be refusing to discount anymore, it sure seems like it holds up pretty well if not better than Civ 6, which strangely enough is getting discounts still. Was a good game."
3873,"Superior game.  In fact, Civ 5 is far superior than Civ 6.  Civ 6 has failed, a reflection of vastly too complex game system architecture.  Civ 6 has failed, also, because of use of ""kiddie"" level drawings used for unit types.  In all, a Waste of Money (to buy) and a Waste of Time (to play)."
3874,"Civ V of course needs no more reviews: it's a classic for good reason, and it's over a decade old at this point.

Sill, I'd like to throw a story into the void:
From June of 2015 to May of 2016, a large group of my friends and I played a long Civ V game over GMR, passing the save file around and around while we trekked along with our massive campaign steeped in secrecy and schemes. My best friend and I secretly teamed up and we worked on an elaborate plot together, night by night. We had documents and folders full of screenshots, and we spent almost a year side by side, plotting to turn on everyone we loved and spring a diplomatic victory together. After months and months of slow and careful planning, we pulled it off, and we ruled the world together.

We're getting married in a couple of months. 

A little advice: plotting to take over the world with your Platonic Friend is not, in fact, very platonic. I can't guarantee Civ V will get you the girl, but it can't hurt."
3875,Just vibes
3876,"This is one of the most fun games I've ever played, once you learn the basic mechanics, you'll become addicted just like me."
3877,Great game
3878,"Chill music as you bonk barbarians and race for wonders. Don't trust a civ that gets too friendly too quick. A bit expensive, especially with the DLC."
3879,I'm 49 and I've played Civ since my teens. Civ V is one of my favorites. I recommend this as a starting point but they all have something you can appreciate. V is the last one before it starts getting a bit more complicated...in  a good way.
3880,dank af but look out 4 ghandi
3881,"A quick game of Civ is an oxymoron. That being said, even as old as it is, this game features incredible strategic game play and resource management. Be sure to keep Ghandi away from the uranium though!"
3882,it is so good. get drunk with your buddies and launch some nukes

3895,"Without a doubt, one of the best 4X games of all time, and possibly the best in the Civ series."
3896,yes
3897,Is good game.
3898,"Doesn't launch after they forced their shitty launcher upon people.
Don't ""fix"" what isn't broken!"
3899,good game
3900,"Civ is a strategy game that is best played with friends. While it can be played by yourself, I find it most enjoyable with one or more friends. All in all enjoyable. I’ve played about 60 hours or so. Pretty enjoyable"
3901,Pretty smoo
3902,"if your workers got scared once by enemy - they stop working whatsoever

3922,It's fun
3923,A timeless masterpiece that is the best in it's genre. buy the dlc and play with your friends and you might be able to catch me in hours.
3924,but it will suck your life away...
3925,Game good
3926,it is good
3927,My broken 7 year old Potato PC runs it pretty nice
3928,It's very easy to get lost in this game and forget how long you have been playing
3929,A game for those that think.
3930,Great game if you like strategy based games
3931,"Great game, good for replay and can keep you busy for a very long time! Really enjoyed this one."
3932,"Dont buy Civ6. The 2k launcher is completely broken. Firaxis is not fixing it. +

Civ5 is where its at. Look no more."

3936,Great game
3937,"Have you ever wanted to built the Pyramids?  Perhaps nuke Brazil, or conspire to take over England.  If so, this is the game for you.  One major side effect is that you will mysteriously lose 5-12 hours of you life from playing just one game."
3938,waste of time
3939,great game
3940,Solid
3941,god help you
3942,This game is awesome. Highly recommend.
3943,"game good
"
3944,Love it.
3945,"This is peak Civ, the only version you need. 
It's addictive... start playing at 7 pm. ""Just one more turn."" Before you know it you've played through the entire night without sleeping and its daylight outside! 
For more realism the Mediterranean map DLC is pretty good."
3946,"shit, boring and cringe"
3947,"Great turn-based strategy, easy to scale to the amount of time you have.

Biggest complaint with this one is how quickly you get slammed with new mechanics. There's so many permutations to win, it can be incredibly unclear if you're even pursuing victory correctly."
3948,is good
3949,"Great for passing the time, it's easy to get really into your simulation and it also some interesting factoids too if you like history."
3950,The definitive Civ experience
3951,one of the top life simulation games
3952,be prepared for some long nights bc you might not be able to stop playing
3953,"It's a fun, clean, semi-historical strategy game. It runs smoothly on even the worst PC."
3954,Great time waster
3955,Extremely fun to play to pass the time
3956,"I liked the ability to conquer the world in more than one way, Also enjoy playing a game that i can walk away from at any time and pick right up later."
3957,GREAT GAMEE
3958,its an ok game i havent played enough of it yet
3959,i mean i guess it's ok.. i don't think i've played enough of this game to give a full review yet
3960,Fun strategy game.
3961,Civ V rocks. Its the quintessential Sid Meier's title to date (even better than Civ VI). It will eat up hours of your time and leave you wanting more. The only real downside is that you need the DLC's too get the full experience. This is a no brainer to get when its on sale w/ DLC.
3962,"Tried playing with people but they all quit. 
I'm sure it'll be fine for other people though."
3963,"Although Civ 6 is now available, this is a still a fun game to play."
3964,Well it's Civ
3965,It's okay..
3966,"Single-player is really fun but playing with others, for me at least, is where this game truly shines. Can get very addictive."
3967,I miss my wife
3968,Better than VI
3969,urgh
3970,Deep and long gameplay
3971,gud
3972,"This game is one of my favorites of all time! The strategies are super fun, and I love playing around with difficulties and scenarios. Hard to get tired of a game that sucks you up like this."
3973,This
3974,Chill and fun with a buddy or two.
3975,finally figured out how to make workers
3976,"Its good
"
3977,"good game
"
3978,With lots of mods its super fun but its almost as unstable as civ 6 even without mods. without mods even a 5 year old can play and win
3979,Great game.  Lousy server (Steam).  Minimal customer support.
3980,gut game
3981,"Everythimg that I was looking for.

3995,love it man its just so cool
3996,"Naming my capital city ""Niggertown"" and slaying muslims. 10/10 would recommend."
3997,I've put so many hours into this game that I now put this on my resume.
3998,"As long as Poland loses, I'm happy."
3999,The only thing i dislike about this game is that my ancient laptop is too old to play it.
4000,
4001,"In 2022, Civilization V is still the best empire building tun-based strategy. It is a little sad and I wish I have new game like this to play, but the original design ideas are still strong, and contemporary attempts to improve them seem to produce opposite effects.

The game allows you achieve victory in many ways, and this feature is one of the core mechanics. You can build an empire strong in military, science, or diplomacy. Even if you are notorious warmonger like most players, you can still build a strong fighting force based on different approaches, such as focusing on technological advantage or economic power. In case of Humankind, you do not have this possibility, you do not event building an empire, but only accomplishing long series of quests in pursuit of fame. This is the age of social media, the number of “likes” is the ultimate power.

In all its complexity, the game is simple to play and easy to learn. Most of the concepts are intuitive and based on common sense. Archery tech gives you archers, a unit that should keep distance from enemy. You do not need to browse manuals to learn this. You do not have to spend hours investigating how to declare war and what kind of twisted and convoluted effect the war will bring, as with Paradox games. You play the game without learning the game for hundreds of hours, and the game feels like the game, not like a kinky series of tax law exercises for accountants.

Civilization V is still filled with real knowledge in many different fields, from history to art. It is familiar, it is informative, it is coherent and logical. You will not find this tone in next installment, Civilization VI (six!), dominated by silly descriptions and comments. It is even worse for games like Endless Space 2, where the entire universe is built on nonsense and fairy tales, such as building physical objects using “influence”.

The game allows you make decisions, that have a significant impact on the future of your empire. Civilization VI (six!) bombards you with small, dull bonuses for a change. You are not creating strategy in your mind, you are collecting small bonuses, and the recipe of the right combinations of bonuses it the key to victory. Or course, you will find the recipe in internet. You can also create your own recipe by browsing and comparing small bonuses which is even more boring.

Civilization V looks and feels like an epic and serious game. Civilization VI (six!) feels like a Smurfs empire building game for kindergarten. I understand that the money lies in children waving their parents' credit cards, but why Civilization franchise was pushed into this trend. Just make a new franchise, for example “Unicorns Empire”.

Civilization V has its problems. Some of them are integral part from the beginning, such as cities spam vs penalizing cities spam. Government forms are no longer simple and meaningful but replaced by social policy which is foretaste of Civilization VI (six!) spam of small and dull bonuses. Overall, it is nothing that can spoil the pure joy of the game.

TLDR: Civilization V is a simple but deep game with well fitted graphics and sound. It is a proper epic empire builder sandbox perfected for years and IMO the best experience of its kind you can get so far."
4002,"best civ game but like i also super like civ vi -- this is just the last ""old"" style civ game (though go buy all the civ games honestly they're all wonderful)"
4003,Good game
4004,I've played a few rounds and would recommend it based on my limited experience.
4005,Dont trust Gandhi with nukes
4006,"Great multiplayer, fun with groups. Watching your cities grow is satisfying"
4007,It's aight
4008,its nice

4010,NICE VERY NICEE....  I keep losing on Settler mode but nice
4011,"I played Civ 4, 5 and 6. If you are indecisive which of these you want to play, here's my evaluation: skip civ 5. It's boring, unrewarding, frustrating and honestly I probably will never install it again. I can't understand how anyone would recommend this game; you erect buildings that cost upkeep, so you get punished for developping your empire. you cannot stack regular military units, therefor moving your army is painful. the only thing i liked about this game was the policy system, you can specialize in some cool ways (like patronage). Empire expansion is severely hindered by happiness, at least back in the day (maybe there was an update?) you didnt have many possibilities to provide luxuries or erect entertaining buildings.
I have thousands of gameplay hours in civ 4 which I spent really delving into fighting offensives against enemy empires whilst listening to marvelous soundtrack. Of course, the graphics are dated, still it's worth playing. Civ 6 is just a beautiful and well-thought with lots of different game modes."
4012,Imagine getting completely nuked by every other civilization on chieftain difficulty. Couldn't be me.
4013,"Civilization, I play these games since the first game in the 90s and keep coming back. And I don't even like strategy games, that is how good this game is."
4014,It is better than civ 6
4015,"I am a nerd for strategy games, and Civ 5 is, in my opinion, one of the best in the genre. With the Gods and Kings expansion. Oh and Brave New World. Yeah, sadly this is one of those strategy games. Y'know, the kind where you basically need to own both of the major expansions in order to get the full experience? Civ 5 without them is still an amazing, but very barebones 4X strategy game. 

Once you DO have the two major expansions, you have one of the most frictionless yet in-depth strategy games on the market today. In my opinion you have no reason not to get it, it'll give you endless amounts of incredible fun and in multiplayer you can nuke ur friends like c'mon."
4016,better than civ 6 imo. hoping civ 7 is amazing
4017,Gewd Gwame.
4018,Tis' a good game
4019,"best strategy game ever, even better than the Civ VI. never gets old.."
4020,"It seems like a good, fun game for quite a while. Then, when you're getting good at it, you realize that the AI in Civ 5 is atrociously and unapologetically terrible. They clearly didn't know how to program a decent AI, so they just allow the AI players to blatantly cheat. This results in the game being incredibly easy to win up until the ""Emperor"" difficulty, where it becomes infuriating because the AI will build wonders and speed through the tech tree at a rate impossible for human players even if everything is done optimally. The game is fun until you're proficient enough, then it's impossible to even come close to losing on ""King"" difficulty and maddeningly frustrating on ""Emperor"", not due to any semblance of skill, but just blatant cheating. It's just sad."
4021,love it
4022,"The strategical and logical aspects of this game is rather rubbish. 
Most of the time the game will be set depending on your location and aquirable resources. These again will state the speed you will be able to expand. Building Settlers is allmost risk free (as you only stop your growth while building them, making gold quite strong for these), but then again, you will need to get more culture for each Policy and have enough Research Points to have the gold buildings to cover the upkeep. 
There are no strategic leaps in this game. No risk and reward, just a slow paced and calculated drift towards the end. The customization route you can take with your empire is very limited, and usually it is dictated in one way or another due to your resources or geographical starting location, and rarely due to other players or computers choices. 
You build a new City, Expanding it with the pace of your gold and happynes upkeep and wait for either the research to grant you more gold for entertainment buildings (so you can expand more) or for your scouts to find vital resources and landmarks that will let you expand without the gold for amnity. If you are lucky with these you will have to wait for your Research to catch up so that you can get another Tier of the eco buildings in each of your towns. There are 3 ""downsides"" of expanding: Building upkeep, Happiness Upkeep and Cultural Upkeep. Cultural Upkeep really pisses me off, as you build another city for your soceity and apparently this reduces the Culture of your civilization as a whole? I'm rather sure that the culture of people changes and deversifies as you travel around a country, and that a larger one would have an increased chance of cultural diversions due to the geographical size and ammount of humans. But hey! in this game multiple cities means you need more culture points for each Social Policy you want to get.
 And on it goes, 
 The computers are extremely random, and so are the barbarians, and the barbarians usually stand for most of damage you take in a game due to early game randomness. I've been swarmed by 3 barbarian outposts at the start of the game, and I've had games where there are none until mid game. Not sure what the gameplan for the computers are. They are rarely logical and tend to suecide by players hands with the dumbest timings and reasons.
 Now let me tell you about the road system in this game. You are forced to get these, and connect them to your cities (Good luck having 10+ cities without road connections or tech to connect them with your home base, you will be gold starved due too the upkeep cost of the cities itself. Welcome to Civ 5, where you build a new city on unoccupied resources AND LOSE MONEY DOING SO. fuck.) as that's just the mechanic of the game. This will let barbarians have areally easy way around your empire on a few stretches, and I've even had hit and run attacks from Siege artillery on my own roads. As you can move Siege Equipement (Even those who normally takes a turn to set up) on the roads, set them up and attack in the same turn and retreat. This is especially broken when it comes to defending places on the map. Your workers never deplete, and as long as you got them to delete your road networks, you can really make some weird attacks and defenses in this game that i really don't think was intended. if the shitty ""No risk and no reward"" type of gameplay did not make the game stale and boring enough allready, a messy ""hax"" of road-networks and siege units could easily be the nudge to quit the game. 
There are no way (nor need) to plan for anything in this game. It just floats depending on your start location  with a few RNG aspects here and there. A lot of easy math, and not really any options when it comes to anything if you want to play ""smart"". Follow the rules of your currency and even it out so that you can get more of all (Faith is optional)."
4023,I love the building aspect of this game seeing my civilization grow.

Sign your a** up."
4035,"Great fun, good variety of difficulties and lots of achievements!"
4036,Overall fun! Lots to learn and adapt to. A game to have on the library for sure.
4037,Best game ever. Just don't play for too long or else you may lose yourself in it.....
4038,Not A single Sid Meier's game that isn't fun in my opinion.
4039,"Civ V has less gaming complexity than Civ VI. Despite this, it brings incredible playability and an agile gaming experience. Although CIV V doesn't have its predecessor's new features, I prefer for far the Civ V game experience."
4040,"Aunque ya ha sido superado por Civilization VI en cuanto a contenido y mecánicas, Civilization V todavía es una gran entrada de la franquicia si lo encuentras barato o sencillamente no te guste la estética cartoon del VI."
4041,This game is far more challenging and is not so comic like as that of VI

4105,Like except Diplomacy.
4106,"Ages well, plays well. Can be played quickly without much depth and at the same time can be played with lots of control. Sure there are better games in each direction, but the games versatility and dare i say, stability is great."
4107,George Washington almost always declares war on Hiawatha within like 15 turns of meeting each other. Accurate game.
4108,"I was watching a CCTV camera footage of myself yesterday, I could not believe it. I could literally tell the Autism from my own movement. My gait was so ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ strange, both animated and rigid at the same time, kind of like a Will McKenZie walk. ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ hell, at this point I have basically embraced the Aspergers. I cannot stand being around other people, I feel so suffocated, I just want to be alone, yet loneliness is a pain in itself.

You have realised, or if not, need to realise that aspergers will lead you to a life of loneliness, that is the truth. You have to be very picky with girls (as if that is a challenge) and find one that is similar to you, easier said than done, I know. Even for Autists who actually make it and get married, the divorce rate is 80%.

I am just embracing loneliness. It is the best thing for me."
4109,Strategy changes with evolving knowledge. A game to play for life.
4110,A wonderfully complex strategy game. Theres a reason this has become an icon.

4116,probably the vest civ
4117,De CIV to play at this moment
4118,one more turn
4119,My old favorite
4120,this game makes no sense
4121,There will never be a need for another Civ game.
4122,"I've been playing Civ since elementary school! I'll play 'till I'm dead, or conquered!"
4123,"BAD - 
AI cheating (and so clearly cheating too, not even trying to hide it), 
Winning a war you didn't start, looking bad to the other AI for completely and totally justifiably destroying their cities so they cant start the next war with you (which is a real war strategy) and you know its coming - considering the AI also now hate you for taking their cities (...in...war...)

Good - 
Navy, 
killing the mean nation's leader,
NOT playing with AI"
4124,"like the game just wish there were spies and a auto mode for the workers where the do everything possible to 
a square  last is wish i could trade with other countries with good and knowledge"
4125,Classic game. Sid Meier is truly one of the great game authors.
4126,Excellent balance. Good graphics while still being low on system requirements. Tons of variety and replayability.
4127,Goog game
4128,There are multiple levels of civilizations and the AI will entertain and challenge any player
4129,"Es un juego muy interesante tiene varias variables, es un reto para cualquiera y se adapta a mucho a la persona pues tiene siete niveles de dificultad. Es muy bueno para que los que nos gusta la historia antigua."
4130,"The best Civilization game so far in terms of historical feel, immersion, and role play.  The graphics, voice, and absolutely amazing soundtrack have me coming back over and over compared with Civilization VI (6).  

I do feel like playing on marathon pacing allows me to enjoy the earlier parts of the game much more than the standard setting.  I also like customizing and modding the game, but sometimes it can get a bit glitchy if you go overboard. 

I really hope Civilization VII embracing an approach similar to Civ V vs. Civ Vi going forward."
4131,the uhhhhhhhh the graphics
4132,is good mayn
4133,its fun
4134,f civ 6 all my homies play civ 5
4135,great play at your own pace kinda game. always fun to play.
4136,"This game is great. 
The Civilization series is an amazing turn-based strategy game that allows you to build the mightiest empire the world has ever seen. The technology tree is rather comprehensive, covering many different creations and discoveries and each has their own significance. 
You have to make sure you properly allocate resources to produce the right buildings, units, and unlock tech in the right order or you will get left behind by the other civs.
The unpredictability of the NPCs allows for many different experiences playing alone, and when playing with friends (with or without added NPCs) is even better. This game is all about strategy, and, though the learning curve is a little steep, the game is seriously fun."
4137,"Sid Meier's pirates was actually my introduction to his games... and I seriously need a SM Pirates 2! But that's a tangent right out of the gate isn't it... sorry.

Ugh, I loved Civ V! I grew up playing RTS, like AOE, EE, BFME, and more, so migrating to 4X genre was not that much of a stretch. The joy of taking a civilization from infancy to flourishing and sometimes bloody heights is addicting. Like they say, ""one more turn.""

I would absolutely recommend this game, especially if you can get it during a sale. But if I were to choose between V and VI... I'd just get VI, Civ VI is a masterpiece that I hope becomes a benchmark of the genre."
4138,Love this game and how it challenges you on many levels.

4148,"Awesome game. Haven't played as many hours as it says cause I previously tended to leave the game open while not playing, but the Civilization franchise is one of the greatest ever made, and Civ 5 is a true gem."
4149,love how it ties human advancement with projects and construction

4215,good game
4216,Ruined
4217,Great game. Hate the damn Zulus for always trying to conquer me.
4218,
4219,Another fantastic installment of the Sid Meier's collection of games
4220,Civ is awesome.
4221,nice
4222,All 752 hours of this game were played in absolute misery...i dunno why i play this....
4223,"Better than Civ 6, my addiction for quite some time at one point.

Overall 10/10"
4224,Best CIv game I've played.
4225,DO NOT PLAY THIS GAME
4226,Personally like to play with friends only but if i need just a game to eat hours of my time this one is good to go with.
4227,h
4228,"played on large earth, the game is more fun and interesting"
4229,yes
4230,8/10
4231,"Classic game

better than civ 6
honestly idk what to say, its good"
4232,good
4233,"heckin good
"
4234,Enjoyable play - good options to keep things fresh for years to come.
4235,It is very nice.
4236,good
4237,great game
4238,"This is the best game ever created. Will it ever go on sale? No, if the price of this game goes under $30 it will destroy the gaming industry, and everyone will just play Civ 5. Play this game. I love you Sid Meier!!!!"
4239,"Magnificent game, huge part of my childhood. Basically just a board game on steroids but once you learn how to play becomes super competitive and fun even against a.i."
4240,"I like this one better then 6.  If you ever need to kill a large amount of time this game will take it and swallow it hole, You will be hours into a game that you kept saying just one more turn 3 hours ago."
4241,ROCKS
4242,"I put 102 hours, I still don't know how to play this game. It is really just clicking. GOOD LUCK. If you figure it out, let me know."
4243,A great and fun civilisation building game to play on your own or with friends (although it does take some commitment to be able to finish a game with friends)
4244,AWESOME
4245,"As the quest for power continues, one can only hope that no one has nukes."
4246,I like the overall essence of the game. The graphics are excellent as well.
4247,"You can get lost in it, big time
"
4248,Ease of use yet interesting for relatively relaxed gaming.
4249,best civ game
4250,This is pure nectar after dealing with the constant crashes and weird mobile game direction they went with for Civ 6.
4251,Absolute based
4252,V for Verymuchnotciv6
4253,h
4254,"Gameplay is good, art direction is amazing."
4255,play motherfuckers
4256,ITS FUN
4257,"I will tell stories to my children and grandchildren about Civ but i'll leave out the part about gandhi causing WW3.
"
4258,Civ 5 definitely has its flaws but its a classic civilization building game and theres nothing quite like it.
4259,wo xihuan zhe ge
4260,Super game :)
4261,"I consider this to be the pinnacle of the Civilization franchise.  Civ 6 has some fun new features, but this is the game I come back to when I'm ready to have hours of my life evaporate into thin air."
4262,Fun turn-based strategy game. Animation is not cartoonish. Game is complex enough to be interesting but simple enough to be relaxing.
4263,It's okay
4264,"Not bad, always play at the prehistoric age and quit the game before i go anywhere near industrialisation. Then I start a new game and do it again! Highly reccomend!
"
4265,Game's pretty good. Played for a few hours.
4266,Fun and strategic
4267,just buy stellaris or something it is much better
4268,A Masterpeice
4269,"Its fine game with good graphics But its getting boring after 5-10Hrs. Expensive, its better you get this game when its on sale but still i recomended this game you to play. Its Turn based game with good graphics. Also look like risk games or game style."
4270,.
4271,only played for a few hours its alright
4272,ye
4273,Just as it has always been...
4274,
4275,Military Strategy
4276,ive gotten off lucky.
4277,This version is beer than VI. VI is over-whelmed with religious wars and politics and there is no way to eliminate the religious conversion garbage from the game. A lo of good mods with/for this game.
4278,"I don't play this anymore because the moment I do, I don't stop. My current 37 hours of gametime are from just 2 games."
4279,good game
4280,+
4281,Great Library Simulator
4282,"The game's full screen mode is TINY. You can resize to use the whole of your screen by using windowed mode, but text remains SUPER tiny even in that case making the game if not unplayable then at least not enjoyable.

Touch mode and setting one's own values in config didn't result in an improvement. This on a ""15 laptop with a 4K touch screen."
4283,More fun than VI.
4284,Classic strategy game
4285,good
4286,"very good yes, very good."
4287,Awsome game.
4288,Good way to pass the time
4289,its good
4290,Civ 5 is a horrible dating sim but a decent game if youre looking to siege
4291,great game and the mods from the workshop are brill
4292,This was my first Civ experience and I thoroughly enjoyed myself.
4293,Help.
4294,"Highly addictive. Makes you feel smart and knowledgeable about the world even if it's not true.

The title music gives me an existential crisis while the game loads. It reminds me that in the grand scheme of things, in all the history of humanity and man's actions, I am sitting at my laptop playing a video game that creates an illusion of power and control. 

Good soundtrack."
4295,"I got this game 2 days ago
"
4296,Great game
4297,boring
4298,this is probably my favorite Turn based strategy game
4299,Civ.
4300,Just ... 1 ... more ... turn!  It's an addictive 4xE strategy game.
4301,"shit is fire
"
4302,"I first played Civilzation on Civ 3, back when I was a young boy. Now that I'm a man, I play Civ 5. 

In all seriousness though, this game is a masterpiece. It's my go to when I have no desire to play other games or I'm just feeling in a slump. Also great to put on with a video on second monitor and just chill. Also I'd like to say I hope they take the next Civ game back to the way this one looks and plays. I don't like Civ 6 because of how cartoonish it is, and how they went for more ""realistic"" things, like workers only live for 50 years irl so in game they'd only be able to complete two tasks before disappearing. It's a video game guys, please just let it be a game and not a simulation.
"
4303,"Fun time killing game. I suck at it, but still have fun"
4304,A great game overall. The hexgrid changes the dynamic of the game for the better and the civs are rich and diverse. A must play of the series.
4305,good
4306,Great game
4307,So much nostalgic goodness!!! I still have the version on the disk in a a case upstairs but most laptops anymore don't have disk drives so I was extremely excited to find this on Steam so I could play it once more!
4308,Better than 6
4309,nice
4310,"I love the graphics. It is also rich with many different units, buildings etc. . The gameplay can be adjusted in many different ways. Problem is, it gets tiresome after a while to select new buildings to be built in cities, also if you have aggressive neighbouring civilisations, you are constantly in war and have to position all your fighting units. I like to start a new game, play it until it is no longer fun, then restart another game. I play it a lot."
4311,"Absolutely love this game, I've played it for years and have continued to do so after the newer version came out. There is just a complex simplicity to it that is so satisfying. Great graphics even for today's standard, DLC options are incredible as well. all around one of the best if not the best immersive strategy games out there."

4319,yeah it's alright
4320,"time becomes a fickle thing, the lure of one more turn is a powerful thing"

4324,yeah

4326,one of the most fun time sinks to be stuck in with your friends
4327,its great fun being a god emperor
4328,My AI ally convinced me to start a war against our mutual AI ally that caused the first AI to go to war with me.  TFW I got WW1'd by fucking robots
4329,"If you like turnbased strategy games, this one is a classic"
4330,good
4331,"Wow, this game is fun. I thoroughly enjoyed playing this game. Only gripe is that it is too old.  5/5 Onion Rings."
4332,Very long game times only complaint. Very solid game overall.
4333,DO NOT BUY WILL NOT BE ABLE TO PLAY. COMPANY KILLED GAME REFUSES TO FIX
4334,A complete classic. If you don't have this you should get it right now
4335,"5/5. Amazing game, worth the 30 dollars."
4336,Best Game Ever
4337,"Dank, wanted it since I was 12. Finally got it at age 21"
4338,Great game and much more strategic than civ 6
4339,"best game for multiplayer nation building. if you try this game you will get hooked
"
4340,excellent game fore its type... been playing it for years
4341,"I mean, its Civ, if you don't have it, what are you even doing"
4342,Good.
4343,invaded france with just idiots using clubs
4344,It's Good.
4345,better than Civ 6 and Beyond Earth
4346,"It is a very well-constructed game and lightweight enough that you don't need a beast of a machine to run it at a reasonable quality level. There are some balance decisions that I disagree with, but that's not something that would make me regret my purchase. The only real problems I have while running this can all be attributed to me having an aging machine.

Happy worldbuilding!"
4347,good game
4348,Just play it.
4349,This is a better version of this classic than VI. Sometimes you need to know when to stop changing things
4350,Favorite strategy game.
4351,"As far as I'm concerned, this is the latest good Civ game out there. I've tried playing Civ 6 on many occasions, and it just lacks... damn near everything the older game has. I don't know if they tried lightening the mood or what, but the cartoonish animations and models are detracting. That's not my only bitch about Civ 6, but this isn't a review of Civ 6, so...

Civ 5 has all the classic traits of a turn-based strategy game. Every bit of it is turn-based. There are no RTS aspects at all, which I find refreshing these days when most TBS games throw it in there for some odd reason (looking at you Master of Orion). On top of it being a true TBS, it's hard as hell to learn. 920 hours into it myself and I still have problems keeping my shit together around mid-game. Once I get past the broke-as-fuck-and-no-army point, it picks up nicely.

It's a bit grander than the Panzer Corps games, and you get a good variety of maps with even just the base game. A couple DLCs and you have a really nice set of maps.

There are some bugs - render errors, characters not completing assigned tasks, etc. - but nothing game breaking that can't be worked around. I very much recommend it if you like classic TBS games."
4352,It's fucking gas
4353,best game bruh ngl xoxo
4354,Great game better than civ 6
4355,
4356,One of my favorite games of all time.
4357,Its fucking heroin
4358,"I like CIV 4 better, but this game checks out."
4359,"I've logged over 2000 hours in 5 years. I played this game on a 2011 MBP and somehow made it last for a decade. This game will take everything from you and give you a center-right interpretation of foreign policy and make you John Mearsheimer of the Civilization world. You will decide that using nukes aren't a big deal and commit genocide as much as you jack off in a day. 

I love this game."
4360,"I have played thousands of hours of CIv IV previously to this one. The mechanics are a little different, its slightly more build tall than wide, and war is slower and more drawn out. It's a good game with a nicer competitive feel to it when vs the AI compared to previous games."
4361,Awesome gmwe play. Greet graphics ansd good ability to tweak game play.
4362,dont get 6. V is superior!
4363,...
4364,Fun game
4365,"Solid game
"
4366,"Good game, for many hours of relaxation"
4367,"I really had no idea how good this game actually was, but this is by far the most addictive and one of the (if not the) most fun game I've ever played. You always got something strategic things to do. Where do you settle? How will you build your civilization to it's absolute glorious? How can you dominate the world or get the highest score? Where do you place your units when in battle or how much civilization can you ally? How will you provide your cities with the resources they need? There's always something to do. 

However, the best thing about this game is to simply watch your civilization grow. There's just something so satisfying to see how over time, your cities grow bigger and more advanced and you realise that you started as a settlement and grew up to an advanced civilization spreading through the outer regions.

I really like this game and I highly recommend anyone to try out Sid Meier's Civilization V. You won't regret it."
4368,"My favourite round based strategy game I've played so far. Did get a bit stale after 200 hours though, but games tend to do that to me."
4369,gotta think
4370,she goes alright maht
4371,Is good :)
4372,.
4373,"You first boot up CIV V in your computer. This is the point of no return. 

12 hours later
“Honey, you should take a break from the computer”
“Just one more turn!”

24 hours later
“Please, go to bed!”
“Just one more turn!”

1 week later
“Honey, it’s time to get off!”
“Just one more turn!”

2 weeks later 
“It is time to get off!” 
“But I need one more turn!” 

1 month later
“If you don’t get off, I’ll have to get you off!”
“Just one more turn!”

2 months later
“Really, GET OFF!”
“One more turn, and I’ll get off!” 

1 year later
“*calling relatives* I can’t get them off! It’s (sobs) impossible!”
“Just another turn, okay?” 

2 years later
“Are you (sobs) okay?”
“Just one more turn, please!”

1 decade later
“Get off, please, it’s been a decade…” 
“Just one more turn!” 
 
2 decades later
“Please, please, please get off!”
“Just one more turn!” 

1 century later
“Finished! Mom?”
“(sobbing, in old voice) Y-y-yes?”
“I’ve won!” 
“(in old voice) FINALLY!”

Once you are on, you can’t stop. That’s why it’s good.
Play CIV V."
4374,good clean fun
4375,Fun for a few games on the higher difficulties (emperor - deity)
4376,gud game
4377,I only meant to play one more turn...
4378,Great strategy game with realistic variables and great evolutionary advancement.  No mater which leader you choose there are unique attributes that make the game interesting.
4379,"the best game ever, it's probably changed my  brain."
4380,"I just wouldn't. Not that I don't like it, but I just wouldn't recommended it."
4381,"One of the greatest games of all time. You won't see the daylight of the next three days if you lay hands on this piece of art, I can guarantee you that. There is plenty to explore, to workaround and most definitely to abuse. 
You never know what civilization might become a neighbour, friend or foe. But one thing is certain, you'll come across Ghandi and he will nuke you into Nirvana."
4382,im the civ 5
4383,Civilization 5 is an exceptional game still good  for its age even at around 12 years old would highly recommend
4384,"It won 't open, even after having played before. 
And there is version mismatch"
4385,"This shit smacks
"
4386,its a good game
4387,It's pretty good
4388,"When things get rough I like to put the game on Settler mode and take over the world and go to space and found like 50 cities and there's nothing anyone else can do about it, and that rules. 

You can name your religion whatever you want. Really enjoy that."
4389,"Boring in the beginning, cool at mid-late phase of the game"
4390,Top del top
4391,.
4392,its civ wat more must i say
4393,"One of the main reasons I enjoy this game, is that there are SO many options, you won't play the same game twice."
4394,(9)
4395,not bad
4396,"Apparently I've played this game for 3060 hours.  127 days.  Over 4 months.  I'm astonished, but not really.  This is my favorite game of all time, and despite its flaws, I like it better than 6 or any other version of Civ.  The expansions are necessary IMO for the best experience."
4397,"Camel archers are the best unit in the game, change my mind."
4398,once you pop you just can't stop.
4399,"Many many bugs, exploits and glitches but still one of the best games in its genre."
4400,imma sell clocks
4401,Worlds greatest time sink.
4402,It is an excellent game.
4403,good gaem i lik
4404,"best game ever i've play! but you must buy god and king dls.
"
4405,Just one more turn and I'll write a review.
4406,"MY GOD. this game is addictive! I hopped on at one point to play a ""quick"" game with my friend, then looked at the clock a little bit later and saw that I had been playing for 8 hours! this is an awesome game."
4407,is fun
4408,The cream of the crop for turn based strategy games.
4409,Good Game
4410,Fucking great!

4415,"8/10 Best 4x Civ game from Fireaxis & 2K even 10 years later. Great selection of Civs, technologies and strategies. Great with friends, the DLC is good and the game has plenty of mod support. The newer games can't even compete. The only downside is that givin enough time, some Civs with certain technologies are brokenly overpowered and that multiplayer rooms sometimes freeze."
4416,Yes.
4417,"Possbly the most fantastic entry in the Civilization series, and a very entertaining game as whole! A definitive pick-up even after all these years :)"
4418,"best civ game out there
"
4419,Rush nukes. Terrorize all of your friends. Destroy their infrastructure and resources. Lose to the guy who attracts more tourists than you. 10/10
4420,"This is a really freaking good game. Easy to pick up on, fun, forces into strategizing. Civilizations are great. Though I totally recommend getting the DLCs, as they really immerse the game. Something bad about the game? Well, that would definitely be about the AI which isn't the smartest. It works like it has no desire to actually win."
4421,"Everything is all fun and games until the Askia of Songhai owns the world's only coal province.

When that happens, this goes from a digital strategy board game to a reenactment of imperialism real quick."
4422,"Not sure, I'll tell you after one more turn."
4423,Classic Games would recommend to anyone wanting to get into strategy games
4424,10/10.
4425,awesome
4426,"Can take getting used to, then it's habit forming..."
4427,yeah it's pretty good
4428,yep
4429,"I have mixed feelings about this one. It was fun enough to play repeatedly, but the AI got annoying. And the concepts became inane with religion and tourism and... on and on. This was the CIV that the series died for me. I played it enough to recommend it, but I don't really jump into it much at all anymore unless really feeling a 4X. Good if you are still a fan, but this was my last one."
4430,great game
4431,It made me sleep deprived :)
4432,It's fun to play with friends. Beware though if you drink while playing games there is to much time to do so while playing this so pace yourself!
4433,Game is great.
4434,"When my husband and I have nothing better to do, we play games, occasionally the game of choice is Civ V. I don't play the online multiplayer, so I cannot speak to that part of the game. My husband and I play as a duo and crush other civs! My husband likes to warmonger, and I take over the map with soft kitty power. I always ensure Carthage is one of our opponents, as Dido pissed me off at some point during our first game together, and now I demand that we destroy her cities every time we play. He's fine with that.

I wish the game had a way to win with religion. I obviously enjoy making cat-themed religions. My husband always eagerly awaits my next cat-centric religion, so he can watch as it dominates the map, as it should. I would more like to RP a tyrannical cat-woke zealot hellbent on ensuring all civs bend the knee, and enshrine cats as the most holy of creatures!

I recommend this game with friends. I'm sure it's fine playing by yourself, but Civ V is a more enjoyable experience when you have someone on your team to enjoy the lamentation of Dido's people as you nuke their cities for their leader's obstinate refusal to accept ""Fat A** Cats"" as their new religion."
4435,fun as fuck
4436,great game
4437,This is a wonderful game! But watch out for how time-consuming it is! You click Play and it's immediately 3 am!
4438,good
4439,Anyone else still play Civ V over Civ VI?
4440,"It's just good. There are a few things that I wish were improved here and there, but that's okay.

I hoped Civ VI would improve those while preserving the feeling of Civ V, but I don't feel that is the case.

If you are in doubt whether to play Civ V or Civ VI the answer is Civ V.
As for the legends of the time-sink Civ is, they are all true."
4441,"Sensible than the next vresion, animation is better than the nesxt version as well"
4442,"Love this game as a option for offline gaming. get it before you head out across across our great country. :-)

"
4443,"If you like strategy games get it. It's substantially cheaper than Civ VI and still very playable. I like the congress in this one better, and most of the other mechanics still hold up pretty well. Wait for a sale."
4444,10/10
4445,Very good strategy game.  Better than the 6th
4446,Its alright i guess...
4447,nice game
4448,"Civilization V is an amazing game and could be put on the list for the best games of all time, and without doubt it is the best strategy game of all time. I have been playing the Civilization franchise since the III in the early 2000's and this game is by far the best, even better than the newer Civilization VI."
4449,i hate playing this game with my friend milan but its awesome!
4450,I'd recommend this game to your MOMMA and she'd have a GREAT TIME
4451,A classic TBS.  Approaching 1000 hrs played over the years
4452,Great game.  Maybe my favorite ever
4453,Still a goated 4X strategy game as long as you have all the DLC
4454,"imagine shitting all over ghandi's weak ass excuse of an army, actually pathetic get good"
4455,Civ is love. Civ 5 is life.
4456,good
4457,"The best strategy game what I have ever played and much better than newer Civ 6, Humankind or Old World"
4458,"An absolute classic! One of the best turn based strategy games out there. This is the best Civ game in the whole series, hands down. Do yourself a favor and buy this masterpiece!"
4459,"Excellent game. I have probably too many hours on record (nearly 500), but this is probably one of my favorite game. Honestly, I have been contemplating about getting Civ 6, but to me that one just looks cartoony. Civ 5 is probably the best one of all. 
"
4460,Great game. All the Civs have been at the very least fun.
4461,"Probably the most well honed and enjoyable of the Civ games. Civ 6 might be more innovative and better in some ways, but it's also more hand holdy than 5, which Civ 5 is bad enough already in that."
4462,"Great Game, Been playing for years (3000+ hours on old account)"
4463,Fun game
4464,idk bro i just like building ig?
4465,416 hours so far. I think that speaks for itself.
4466,PACIFISM. LOVE. HUGS. KISSES. HANDSHAKE.
4467,Really great game :)
4468,"I always think this was boring, but i spend 10+ hours playing 

I get afraid when I boot it up 

time will be warped"

4471,"""Only one more Turn"""
4472,
4473,"Whilst CIV V is a visually stimulating game, the CIV team have still not fixed a problem that has existed since CIV II - The game crashes during the last phase of the game. This has been an ongoing error that has not been fixed despite many other changes to the game. It's probably a 'stack overflow' when processing a torrent of information during action-packed game finishes. 

It's hard to imagine a more disappointing game outcome than an irrecoverable crash just when you are going to win the game. What is worse is that even if you save the game and reload the saved game file, the game still crashes at the same moment in the game. The backend of the game needs to be updated to avoid 'system crashes'."
4474,my favorite game!
4475,It's like crack except it's gems and bananas.
4476,Is Not Alright.
4477,.
4478,"Before this, I've had 3, 4, and 6. Each version has different advantages and disadvantages in gameplay. I like this one."
4479,"Civ V is the best Civ, provided you have all the DLC."
4480,great game
4481,"its good 
"
4482,"off line strategy with good content.....""off line"" being the important part"
4483,Why can't I be a dictator
4484,i mean yeah its a good game
4485,IT GUD
4486,Great strategy game for History buffs over 50
4487,Very interesting game!
4488,its good i like it
4489,Love this game
4490,Cool!
4491,best game ever on PC!!!!
4492,да товарищ коммунизм номер один!
4493,"just the game in general, is one of the best games that I've played in a long time, and ever since."
4494,It's a hoot.
4495,just a fabulous game for me!
4496,it slaps
4497,"Great 4x turn based strategy game. Play from the ancient era through to the Modern era. Lots variability in nations and units, and has multiple ways to beat the game."
4498,"I have been playing Civ 5 for over 10 years. Every major DLC expansion vastly improved the game, to the point that Gods and Kings and Brave New World make it barely recognizable compared to the base game. If you get this game I highly recommend the expansions.

Civ V is a game that can be enjoyed alone or with friends, there are plenty of mods and each playthrough generates a new world for you to settle and conquer. Each leader presents their own perks and play styles giving this game plenty of replayability. I cannot recommend this game enough, especially if you can catch it on sale for less than $10."
4499,un
4500,Yeah it's pretty fun.
4501,very enjoyable
4502,Enjoyble
4503,The most addicting game ever made.
4504,"This is one, tough a** game.   But if you want an authentic experience, in the age of CIV having minor nation and citi-states, this is it.  CIV VI is fun for its environmental impact challenges, and rewards it gives for exploring more of the map.. but I often come back to the serious tone of CIV V.  

CIV IV of course, still holds that highest reward in my heart, as the best of the original CIV masterpieces. But for the new-age design choices, you can't go wrong with CIV V complete edition."
4505,mid
4506,"Civilization the fifth is the gift that keeps on giving. It's the only game I play consistently decade after decade. It has its faults, but is just moddable enough to work around them. I only wish a research randomizer existed.

The latter expansions show a distinct lack of design, especially in the interface. You can't, for example, look up pantheons anywhere; the list is simply hidden until you qualify to choose one. Same with ideological social policies. Considering you can see all the techs and social policies and use the civilopedia to look at nearly everything else, it's just lazy design.

There are a few frustratingly commonly occurring edge cases that feel like they weren't designed much at all. If you use a great engineer to hurry a wonder, someone can still steal it from under your nose the next turn. If a city is captured, any unit inside, no matter how combat capable or healthy, will simply vanish. These kinds of things don't come up too often but they're hella annoying when they do.

There exists a layer of familiarity attainable by experience alone, that the game completely fails to educate you on. The number of times you open the civilopedia to figure out some interaction only to find nothing is amazing. Like you can literally search for a thing that exists in the game and the civilopedia just doesn't have a page for that thing, even for some incredibly basic gameplay elements. Information on how terrain is modified or what improvements do just seemingly isn't there, it's just stuff you learn by trial and error.

But for all its minor faults it's still the best civ game to date, and contender for the best video game of all time."
4507,Absolutely love it. Consumes way too much time.
4508,Addicting and waaaayyyy better than Civ 6.
4509,yes
4510,"No brainer on sale for complete/gold edition.  100's of hours (or more) of content and is a little bit easier to get into and understand than civ 6.

Also a 'grittier' look than the cartoonish Civ 6, which I appreciate more"
4511,What is diplomacy?
4512,Fantastic game.
4513,10/10 - good for depressive episodes and relaxing days.
4514,it's Civi.
4515,I love this game!
4516,good?
4517,"Rehab centers should make people play this, its better then crack, and cheaper."
4518,"It's my favorite Civ game, better than 6 imo"
4519,This is the best game and you know it.  I've sunk over 3100 hours into it so far and will likely play this game until the day I die.
4520,Buy it very fun
4521,"Even with a failing economy, the AI still seems to be able to magically summon troops to wipe my armys off the face of the earth. Fuck this game."
4522,Great game! Learn about history as well. Win using diplomacy or military tactics or both.
4523,Personally think it's a better game than civ 6 which a lot of people don't agree with.
4524,quality game.
4525,fun and enjoyable game.
4526,Great advancement in the civilization series
4527,its ok i guess
4528,The number of hours played says it all.
4529,I've been playing Civilization since version 1 and I still love it.

4531,if  you want chunks of your life to literally dissapear. Try this game.
4532,"Played it for so long today that it froze my computer and got rid of all my progress in a 450 turn game


10/10 I'm gonna do the exact same thing tomorrow"
4533,This is a great game. Excellent replay value!
4534,
4535,"What's more to say, this is the best of civilization."
4536,I've been playing Civilization since CivNet in the 90's and this is by far the best one so far. Not trying to take anything away from Civilization 6 but as far as I'm concerned it doesn't stack up to Civilization 5.
4537,:D
4538,you have so much fun that you forget that you have been playing for 6 hours straight
4539,"I love this game. I play it incessantly. Quit taking prozac, ditch all your other addictions: Leave this open on your computer and dip into it for a few minutes when you need focus and calm. It's like a lower order of prayer."
4540,"The Good - It's Civ V
The Bad - Doesn't have UI scaling that works with my microsoft surface."
4541,YES

4544,its fun

4547,a good way to spend hours.
4548,Based.
4549,a great game  different every time
4550,Fantastic game.
4551,Addictive classics.
4552,"Played around a thousand hours on my old steam account.This game is a CLASSIC and needs to be in your library if you enjoy 4x games.

ON A SLIGHTLY DIMMER NOTE:
The franchise has failed to innovate and shake up the core mechanics of the game, unlike other 4x game franchises."
4553,Do not trust that snake Pachacuti.
4554,"It's a classic, y'all, what else is there to say?"
4555,fun and challenging
4556,Keep coming back to Civ V. Absolute polished classic compared to the latest IMO
4557,"I would say buy it.  But that's just me.  It is good.  I think it's better than Civ 6.  It is fun if you like these kinds of games, you know what I'm sayin'?  So, I recommend it.  I hope you have a nice day.  Take care now."
4558,fun
4559,"10/10

Nuking another civ's settlers is a form of diplomacy"
4560,el good gamo
4561,"one of my all time favorite strategy games, Civ 6 was a huge disappointment"
4562,"Easy to understand (difficult to master!), lots of customization, and worth the time!"
4563,Bleety globs on mastas cane ran wilbly wode forneight.
4564,Fantastically fun game. I wish they'd kept updating this rather than making Civ6.
4565,A very good game
4566,"i LOVE civilization v. I use alot of mods which makes the game perfect. I would like a barbarian mod where the barbarians are smarter and heal up like we do, along with taking cities it would be awesome."
4567,"Fun to play.
"
4568,"A friendship was lost, a rivalry was born."
4569,great time passer
4570,"Good game, the type of people that play this are cringe tho so watch out irl or they might forward settle you"
4571,"This review is not a review of how good the game is, merely a comparison between this and Civ VI if you are unsure which you should buy.  Both are amazing, but the latter suffers from a much more predatory business model preventing it from being a strictly better game. 

Both games are decent if played completely Vanilla, but both are prohibitively expensive if you want the full experience.  Civ VI MUCH more so than Civ V.  

Strictly Vanilla, Civ V and VI are equal.  
With all DLC, Civ VI is clearly a better game.  
For the price of a full game, you can get Civ V with much more DLC than Civ VI, and if the two games are not on sale I would recommend buying this game instead of Civ VI as you will get much more value for your money.  

However, if on sale, this game pales in comparison to Civ VI.  The additional modes, mods, and improved UI of Civ VI is simply better.  Civ VI has the benefit of coming in a later generation of game design than Civ V, and it shows.  Mods can close the difference quite a bit, but the difference is still there.  The problem is that the gap is not so wide as to warrant the $100+ difference in price tags between the two games. If you intend to play with friends, get whatever they are playing, it will be fun I can assure you of that.  If you intend to play single player however, the experience is similar enough that you should consider what you actually want to get from the game before choosing between Civ V and VI.  Civ VI has a lot more depth than Civ V.  A lot of people may disagree with that sentiment, but the district system introduced in Civ VI introduces a massive amount of potential strategies in city management, and the changes to how civilizations are punished for playing wide in Civ VI result in a much more complicated lategame than Civ V can manage.   The additional modes offered in the frontier pass also add such an incredible amount of variability to Civ VI, that Civ V cannot, with the only drawback being the prohibitive pricetag attached to Civ VI due to the necessity of owning the DLC. 

TL;DR:
If you want to play Civ Vanilla, V = VI. 
With all DLC, or if you intend to play for thousands of hours like me, V < VI.
If your budget is limited, or neither are on sale, V > VI. 
If you want to dip your toes into the Civ Franchise for the first time, V > VI.
If you want to play competitively, V < VI."
4572,"It gets old, lost interest in it."
4573,hexagons go brrr
4574,What a game.
4575,One of my favourite games :)
4576,"Um.. I found it fun? There's depth to that, but that's all I can procure right now. Like, really, really fun."
4577,I like V better than VI.
4578,"once you start a game, you play 20 hours until its done.... straight."
4579,"Honestly a classic game, mechanics in my opinion are better than civ 6."
4580,Conquering the world is fun
4581,"Very fun game, especially with mods, however there is a very large learning curve, at least for me. 750 hours in and I still have trouble winning on highest difficulty, maybe winning 1 in 5 games on Deity, 3 in 5 on Immortal. If you like strategy games and want something to consume your life, give it a go."
4582,Still the best Civ game to this day
4583,good
4584,The most fun severe addiction you will ever have
4585,nuking cavemen is really fun
4586,I mean come on it's civ 5 how could I not give it a positive review.
4587,Game gets a little stale after the first few hours tbh.
4588,bloody addictive fun game
4589,It's a lot of fun!
4590,"it really good, do play. Please add the mughals"
4591,"I love the many many tech, culture, and terrain options available. Every game is unique. I would love to add more nations to the available list, though. Every decision matters and the consequences of those decisions will reflect as you progress in the game. So choose and plan wisely!"
4592,We’ve been trying to reach you about your car’s extended warranty
4593,Fun
4594,"im pretty savage at this game, usually make my friends cry"
4595,"I have owned this game since the very beginning and it is by far the best of the Civilization games that I've played. As you can see by the hours put into it, there are literal hundreds of hours of game play and decisions to make. 10/10 would recommend if you enjoy TBS games."
4596,"10/10
"
4597,yaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa!!
4598,"Amazing.
- Tons of factions to choose between with only a few being complete trash (Iroquois, Venice).
- Every game is different with maps and playstyles varying widely.
- Well balanced gameplay against the computer, less balanced in PvP.

I know this is obvious, but this game is way better than Civ 6."
4599,The game is too addictive. Play with sound turned off.
4600,haha weapon. i was 15 cents short on the expansion i wanted so i am sad.
4601,"If you or a loved one suffer from the ""just one more turn"" affliction please wait a second and ill tell you what to do after this one quick turn I promise it wont take long."
4602,"Nevermind Civ VI... Go back to CIV V and reestablish your franchise in a proper manner, ya goons"
4603,it's great
4604,Just one more turn
4605,Great game that quells my boredom in life :)
4606,"Very good, game, slow online loadings between turns"
4607,I dabbled a bit and it seems alright but not sure I've played enough to go into all the ins and outs.
4608,"Fun game, mulitiplayer is a little more buggy than i'd like but nothing that can't be worked around. overall fun and engaging strategy game"
4609,very fun quality game
4610,"edit: turns out the option ""Pitboss"" makes the AI not take over. Wow what a good descriptive name wow. review changed to positive

gonna have to give this a negative review purely because of how dysfunctional the multiplayer is. i could forgive the frequent loss of connection and other bugs if the AI didn't take over and ruin everything when someone disconnects"
4611,"As good as it gets. If you are an old fart like me who kind of stopped around Civ2/3 or FreeCiv but now would like something with better graphics, this is the sweet spot. It has added more depth and options without totally bogging you down like Civ6 does. Lots more things to do, interface is good and intuitive enough (unlike 6) and it is fun to play."
4612,epoc game
4613,"very enjoyable, multiple cultures to choose from extending the game life"
4614,"Super fun and interesting grand strategy game, and not too hard compared to other games like hearts of iron.
It doesn't get old that quick because of the variety of leaders, units, and stuff like DLCs. Recommended!!"

4617,Don't trust Gandhi
4618,"Probably the best Civ game and I have been playing since civ 2. Absolutely loved civ 3 and 4, but this just adds a little more graphical polish and great gameplay. I like civ 6 too but still finding some elements weird to get into. This is close to the perfect civ game."
4619,fun
4620,10/10 genocide simulator
4621,"Launched the game, started to manage settings, set everything to Terra Nova."
4622,"Simply fantastic. I play this game on my Macbook Air that I got for university and it still runs surprisingly well, even on larger maps. 10/10 would recommend for simple fun, amount of content, and almost endless variety."
4623,"Ahh CIV V the game that's so infamous for having time magically elapse. I love this game so much! Whether it's the music or the cutthroat diplomacy programmed into the AI's there's so much fun to be had in this game. I love rolling up a nice doobie and listening to the USA music, something so majestic about it!! This game is perfect for casual yet intricate gameplay and can be very addicting. Remember, Ghandi will nuke the shit out of the very first moment he gets, don't let his innocent stature/physique throw you off, I've been nuked PLENTY OF TIMES BY GHANDI!!!! All in all, it's a great time killer, please clear your schedule for the day before booting this up.

Also, ""One last turn"" is a huge fallacy, it never ends up being just one god damn turn."
4624,"Reliably fun, good to come back to when I feel like it."
4625,"Game is facking great, played enough times to master none of it! :)"
4626,...
4627,It took some time to get the hang of things but it's a really cool game to keep coming back to that doesn't get boring.
4628,yee

4630,Spent way too much time in this game. Worth every second.

4632,~1600 hours in it get's really good.
4633,Much better than civ 6
4634,brilliant game
4635,Very replayable and good mechanics. Good way to kill a few hours in a blink
4636,It is a fun and engaging game.
4637,"I suppose that after playing 8.7k hrs I enjoy this game. 1) it is turn based so I have a lag between moves or actions and I am not worried about what the AI is doing during my turn. 2) I do not have to deal with trying to 'engage' the enemy. I attack and the game determines the winner. 3) I enjoy the different DLC mod be it different civ, maps, or game mechanics. Admittedly I have mod that speed the playing and make it easier to play and win. But I still have a challenge."
4638,Need Theodora sloppy
4639,V. GUD.
4640,"Great game, multiple ways to play
can't rate it highly enough"
4641,You can play as the UK
4642,great game
4643,Fantastic game. Civ has come a long way and I've played it all my life; just gets better.
4644,"Time is relevant with this game. An hour becomes a day, a day becomes a weekend, a weekend becomes a divorce. Be warned"
4645,I love Sid Meier's Civilization V! I'll be playing it for years to come. I love the graphics in this version. The realism in this game is the Civ style I prefer. Great depth and I really enjoy playing the HUGE EARTH map. Thanks Sid!
4646,Great Game over all

Complicated mechanics that can be understand.
Resuming a multiplayer session never works."
4654,yet to beat it on its hardest setting with all factions. replyability is very high
4655,"The best of the series since the old Civilization... The recent concept are clear and make a lot of sense, managing the priorities between growth, science and gold feels natural..."
4656,The multiplayer is a little unstable but still one of the funnest games I've ever played. Love it
4657,cool
4658,I havent played this for awhile but i fear that if i do i will never stop (this playtime was achived in 3 sessions)
4659,"Good game, always a classic"
4660,Con:  This game is addicting!  Pro:  This game is progressively very challenging at each level.  Con:  This game cheats at times.  lol
4661,Lived out my fantasies of creating a Neo-Carthaginian Empire while conquering the Aztecs with war elephants. 10 out of 10
4662,Yes
4663,great game
4664,I didn't think I'd like this game as much as I do! It is enjoyable to sit and play alone or with friends.
4665,Great game to play. Too bad you can't play as Adolf Hitler and create the 3rd Reich...
4666,Not played much seems fun tho
4667,its a nice game
4668,"As with all civ versions except perhaps 6, mods make this game."
4669,Garbage
4670,Huh ?!!! morning !
4671,little outdated graphically but gameplay has always been sick
4672,good soup
4673,"I have an addiction. If you like simple civ-building games, its the one. Lots of mod potential, plenty of ways to play it vanilla, and graphics aren't bad considering its age."
4674,I like the units and simplicity of their moves. The game is intuitive and not very complex to understand.
4675,Fantastic game.
4676,"Like Civ VI but good
"
4677,yes
4678,v fun
4679,I played 1000+ hours. What do you think.
4680,Give me the ICBM and this would be a perfect game.
4681,"Civilization 5 is the 5th game in the Civilization Franchise (shocker!) a turn based strategy game where you take up the mantle of one of the greatest minds in Human history, and set out to make the greatest civilization of all time

Will you conquer the world as Atilla the Hun?
Or be the first to establish a interstellar colony on Alpha Centauri?

The choices are yours"
4682,Perfect.
4683,"Greatest of the CIV series!
One of my all time favorite games."
4684,Great game for countless hours. Mods add a lot of time as well.
4685,"Highly detailed, strategic focus, constructive rather than destructive, learn about history and early technologies while having fun, pick a strategy to win that fits your personality."
4686,"I spend hours in this game, getting my ass beaten by my friends."
4687,gud
4688,The game is okay.
4689,Just one more turn...
4690,"yes, I recommend this the best version of civ.  
The landscaping graphics are great.  There is even a civ5 skin for civ6.
AI is average good.  I enjoy the multi-player as well, will need to patch though, so check FAQS.
GOOD game overall.  a long turn based game,. I typically play, when I am doing something else, 
because its a long haul strategy game.  I have played all versions of civ and 
always come back to this one.
I started with the original civ1 on my Amiga computer.  I miss the banter of the advisers and the 
wonder films from the original."
4691,"I obsessively play the civ games. I still play all of them, each having their own slight different strategy to win."
4692,One of my favorite all time in the series!
4693,"i got recommended it by a friend and now i have a deeeeeeeep problem. 
highly recommend.
"
4694,I still have some research to do on this game but it's solid so far
4695,Fun strategy game.
4696,needs more nuclear weapons
4697,What's not to love?
4698,good
4699,"pretty good game

4700,kk luek
4701,"very nice

4702,Great game
4703,"In my opinion, Civ 5 is better than Civ 6"
4704,"Good Game

"
4705,Great game. I've spent countless hours playing this and keep finding myself coming back to this game after being burnt-out over the years. Highly recommended
4706,Great continuation in the series.
4707,One of the first true PC games that isn't a shooter I've gotten into. Very fun and great for wasting time
4708,"Classic game, throw on civ vox populi to it and it magnifies the game.  

Still AI issues as always regarding diplomacy even with vox populi.  Think they need more complex data sets to determine AI probability of actions."
4709,"Second favorite Civ, behind IV, Venice ftw"
4710,"I have spent more time playing this game than any other. Lots of games in my Steam library to choose from, and I keep coming back to this one. Love it. Lots of replayability."
4711,"woo civ!
"
4712,"one of the best game ever, money well spent."
4713,like it
4714,"good go nuke
"
4715,It was the game that made me get a pc and I love it everyday
4716,"Mac-PC mismatch without easily available solutions makes the game unplayable, and completely worthless."
4717,gg
4718,everything
4719,bonertastic
4720,Great Civi game
4721,"Not usually a fan of strategy games  but i can say i absolutely love this one and cannot stop playing.

10/10"
4722,"This game is excellent.  If you're considering a 4x game, start with Civ5.

The rest of this review assumes you have played Civ6.
The following few things are what Civ6 gets better than Civ5.  If something doesn't appear on the list, assume Civ5 does it pretty well, because Civ6 isn't bad.
City-States, Luxury resources, Religion, UI, and ways to avoid warmongering penalties."
4723,"10pm: Just a turn or two and I'm going to bed.
A turn or two later: Is that the sun?"
4724,"Before I played this i had a big penis, two girlfriends and a lot of will to live. None of these things have changed, so I have no idea if this game is good."
4725,maybe the best in the civ series
4726,Bri'ish
4727,fun game
4728,BETTER THAN CIV 6
4729,10/10
4730,Good though I wish I could break the Geneva Convention as a mechanic.
4731,A very fun and addictive game.
4732,worst game i've ever played
4733,Nice
4734,good
4735,"love it

4739,i would love to play this with my mom but the drinks and gets angry :/ :/ :/
4740,the game wont load past the steam screen - you hit play then nothing happens
4741,Very great addition to the civilization franchise.
4742,game gud
4743,"easy to get caught in the endless wonders of civilization v. never gets old, can always come back to the game and experience the same magic."
4744,Alright
4745,"By one of the best games I've ever played and stands well above many other games of the same genre that have come out since, even it's own series. The one singular problem I have with the game is the inability to play modded multiplayer. Just......WHY? It makes literally no damned sense, there are a thousand other lesser games out there that DO have this option and yet the only way to make it work on CIV V is some sketchy backdoor workarounds and game cracking, which I honestly don't care for the trouble of all that. I'd still get the game if for nothing else to play the base game with friends or awesome mods in SP. 

Firaxis PLEASE release an anniversary update or something that allows for modded multiplayer, it's comical that a game as legendary as this has such a glaring flaw still."
4746,Different civilizations to play with with different  abilities.
4747,yeah great game
4748,Very Fun Game
4749,mi partido favorito
4750," not much of a single player type of gamer; However, this game is one of the few exceptions. Multiplayer is also loads of fun. This game has provided too many hours of fun and entertainment. I've played other Civ games, but this is the one I keep coming back to."
4751,I enjoy this game as a brain dump.
4752,"great game, but it wont let me play after i got a windows update"
4753,all of a sudden doesnt work
4754,"played for 5 hours straight the day when i got the game, recommended for civilization fans, not recommended for people wanting a stable schedule."
4755,Really enjoyed this game since it's been released.
4756,talasorn hayatta oynayamaz nokta.
4757,very good game
4758,"One of the best civ versions, although would like it to be somewhat more complex/strategic"
4759,sure
4760,too many technical hitches
4761,"This, like every Civ version, is a time sucker. But it's fun if you like this type of game."
4762,"The game itself is fun but I now have two unrelated saves that crash consistently every time I try to advance the turn, with default settings and no mods. Don't buy this, at least on Mac, unless you love being unable to get to the end of a long game."
4763,"I think this is the best version of all of the CIVs. Has a ton of great mods available that make it so.
There are other games in this ilk that are better now. In the day this was ""the bee's knees"" el oh el"
4764,The GOAT
4765,"Despite some of the bugs and errors, this is still the most enjoyable civ game out there. Spent hundreds of hours on this game over the years and would recommend it in a heartbeat. Takes some getting used to, and the learning curve isn't too bad. Used to watch Filthy Robot's videos a while back and would recommend them to anyone starting out in civ."
4766,May be my favorite version of Civ.
4767,"Spent 200+ hours on it, and still finding something new to be amazed at.
Good graphics, IMO best Civ game."
4768,I try to conquer the world and everyone keeps spamming me with dumb treaties. I don't want peace! I want conquest!

4773,"Excellent game and definitely worth a play. Great replayability and while the DLCs make it more fun, they aren't required to have it be enjoyable, especially for a beginner. Even though Civ 6 is now out, Civ 5 holds up to it and can provide enjoyment."
4774,"Its a lot of fun - mechanics and graphics are great, but sometimes the sound goes funny and you have to restart the game to sort it out."
4775,"I make my people happy, so they make more people- and that's bad for some reason. 
They demand shellfish and cocoa and they have never seen these things before but expect me to procure them.
10/10"
4776,Absolute time sink. Believe the memes. Can't speak to multiplayer.

4780,The classic go-to. Every edition is great but V was something special for me and my friends.
4781,Pretty good game.
4782,"its fun
"
4783,Love this game! No alternative to Civilization. Haven't played Civilization 6 but this is great!
4784,good vibes while destroying nations
4785,I have to much time in this game. Yes get it. If you want to waste a whole weekend and not leave your house this is the game for you. The only regret you will have is the amount of Doritos dust crumbs on you and now showering in two days.
4786,decent use of your time
4787,"awesome game
"
4788,good fun
4789,Civilization V: Brave New World - 7 thumbs up!!!

4794,"probably the best one of the lot, never gets boring 

just love this game"
4795,it do be fun :D
4796,Just one more turn and I will go to sleep.
4797,I like turtles.
4798,I lost interest in this game after completing every single achievement.
4799,has trebuchets👍👍👍👍👍👍👍
4800,"""One more turn"" is the greatest lie known to man."
4801,its great
4802,"Solid, even formidable, game but not rewarding enough."
4803,awsesome
4804,good
4805,"I love this game. I am not too into map-like strategy games such as this, but if I were ever to play it would only be this. It has great mechanics, CPU actions, and graphics. The aesthetics of the game are 50% of the reason I play it. If you admire history and love strategy, then play this epic virtual war of a chess game!"
4806,sick
4807,yes its fun
4808,"Much better than civ 6
"
4809,do not try
4810,"Realistic strategy required by player, excellent graphics."
4811,Greatest strategy game ever made? Maybe.
4812,Good game :
4813,tbh its literally the same as civ 6 to me but they both good so idc
4814,"Way better than 6, great replay value. Best Civ game."
4815,my IQ goes up every game
4816,"Good game, barbarians are a pain, but otherwise a good game."
4817,
4818,"Civ V is an excellent game, all in all, and I love it. However, it has major flaws that make the game unplayable in the end. 

After a few complete play-throughs I started to notice that, at a certain point, the AI reaches what I have come to call the ""wall of derp"" - Sometime in the late middle ages/ early industrial era the AI shows its true colors; that it is a complete retard. The result is that the exciting, interesting, AMAZING early game suddenly turns into a giant, tedious chore of grinding through the late game and its many demanding, complex, click intensive, features (which would all be amazing if the AI were competent enough to use them).

The early game contains some of the best video game experiences I have ever had. Its friggen amazing. It has you building a small civilization, exploring, discovering a big wide world as you secure your own little empire. In the early game the AI is excellent; it makes very logical, reasonable decisions that make you feel like you are faced with worthy challengers and its just plain fun. 

In the late game pretty much everything goes to sh*t. After everyone has settled their core cities and established a basic infrastructure, your strategy as a player must and adapt to the changing circumstances of the globe. The AI does not adapt at all; instead it goes into ultimate derp mode and all of the fun disappears, vanishes out thin air, and it usually takes me about 5, in the early industrial era, to realize that my awesome plan for global dominance has just lost all of its appeal because its no fun when your opponents suck; its just a chore, and thats not what I play games.

Specifically, the AI will arbitrarily declare war, invade you lands with 10 units and then...sit there and get shot to bits by your cities. And then, when its army is decimated it will contact you and offer terms of peace- and give you a city or two. Utterly nonsensical. Thats just one example of the AI's extremely derpy late game behavior. 

Some people say you just need to up the difficulty level. Personally, I dont think that helps at all. It just makes the derpy AI way OP. It doenst make it more fun.

I love the game, and I want to love it even more, but after playing it for a long time I find myself putting it down in dissapointment and frustration. Harsh, I know, but true."
4819,"One the greatest strategy games ever made, hands down."
4820,incroyable
4821,daily reminder: don't trust everyone. especially Gandhi and Attila
4822,"Cool story, bro..."
4823,"I will admit I do not know how I got that many hours in this game, but I have really enjoyed them all. This is a very good game (with the added DLC), it has great music and I love playing it. Though now I would properly recommend Civ VI, as I think it has also become a great game with all of it's DLC. Overall, I always enjoy this game."
4824,Multiplayer is a bit buggy with frequent drops but this game is more addictive than nicotine.
4825,yes good
4826,Great Game
4827,I mean it's civ. You know it's good. Next Turn.
4828,gaming
4829,:like:

4834,great classic game
4835,wow.

4855,"This is possibly the best game I have ever played, Very addicting."
4856,"Welcome, o divine Montezuma, we grovel in awe at your magnificence, may the heaven shower all manner of good things upon you all the days of your life!"

4859,"It's something, that's for sure. A fun game all around."
4860,I can't really thumbs down a game I played this much even though it was with mods.
4861,Civ 5 is a staple in the strategy game genre. Often I find myself lost in the options that one has. Fantastic game.
4862,good clean fun
4863,good game
4864,A nice turn based strategy game. Fully adjustable to skill level and many starting options to pick from. never get bored of this one.
4865,"very fun

4869,"I don't care that Beyond Earth and 6 exist, this is still better."
4870,One of the best Strategy Games i've ever played
4871,much fun no one likes egypt
4872,It's okay.
4873,"This is the best one cause you can play without it crashing. Civ 6 crashes on xbox series x and pc, its been happening and nothing is ever said about it, there is no fix coming. only winter."
4874,"A favorite
"
4875,God must be a lonely entity
4876,:)
4877,Awesome Game
4878,"Its a pretty great strategy game. Has aged well. Different enough from Civ VI that I recommend playing both - they are quite different experiences and each has their pros and cons. 

This is the Civ game that made Civ games mainstream. If you're a 4X fan you should at least check it out."
4879,really hope i can finish a game one day
4880,"Great strategy game to play with friends. Challenging and exciting. Definitely don't regret buying the game. It is more fun with friends, so if you buy, make sure you have friends to play with. It's good to learn on single player, but the game is much more interesting with friends."
4881,I love the civilization franchise. This installment has proven to be quite playable.  I still haven't stopped!
4882,"very good game I now get to eat women everyday cause of how cool I am
"
4883,"Hexagons with Civ. Some really awkward units mechanics, but overall one of the best in the franchise."
4884,Great game if you like board strategy games.
4885,My favorite game of all time.
4886,ease of play....everything
4887,Pretty fun. Im not even that good at it and I still love playing.
4888,"Hours of fun.
"
4889,Just one more turn.
4890,Amazing game !!! Love it especially the Multiplayer x
4891,Yes i am a fan!
4892,"this mf Gandhi really out here instigating me with nukes cuz i didnt agree with one of his homies
keep this mf in the caste system"
4893,This game makes me abandon all my morals and start raining down nukes on everyone. 10/10
4894,good soup
4895,I love civ! this is better than civ 6!
4896,"hard to get the hang of but is alot of fun
"
4897,It game. It good. :)
4898,Job's done
4899,"awesome game
"
4900,Love the game for its creative nature. Played through several civilizations...
4901,tight
4902,"It's like playing a detailed time spanning game of Risk. Plus the game board is alive with cool animations and sounds, great graphics. I honestly like playing this more than Civ VI."
4903,Never trust your allies they will turn on you once you refuse to give them your money.  Great times
4904,Recommend it
4905,this is a nice time consuming game love the fact how your decisions really make the game fun and hard.
4906,Best one of the series.
4907,fajne fajne ale kupcie dlc bo bez to troche nudnawo się robi szybko
4908,just brilliant game play
4909,Great Game. I love the mods>
4910,"AAt the lower levels, this game is boring.  Once you get to Level 5, the AI give far too much advantage to the computer, i.e., the programmers cheat too much.  I've wasted enough of my time on it."
4911,"Historically accurate:

-America adopts communism
-Gandhi nukes everyone
-Spain adopts Islam as their official religion."
4912,good but i have seen better games [ would recomend it tho ]
4913,very cool and fun game!
4914,it good
4915,"Consumes your life, more addictive and destructive than drugs."
4916,Take everything wrong with the Civ franchise and make it worse. Take everything right with previous games and remove them. This game is super novel but novel and fun are not the same thing.
4917,The best civ game.
4918,"I got this as a free game with my CyberPower Intel i5-560M AMD Radeon 5650HD Windows 7 32-bit 4GB RAM gaming laptop purchase for Wayne State University in 2010.

I played this once on that laptop and got an Out of Memory error and never played it again on that laptop.

Today, 12/17/2021, I have played Sid Meier's Civilization V on my i7-7700K, GTX 1080, 16GB RAM Windows 10 64-bit Desktop for several hours after playing it for 24 hours straight from 12/15/2021 to 12/16/2021. 

This game is amazing.

This game is everything I have ever wanted in a single player strategy game.

God Bless Sid Meier.

God Bless Bill Stealey."
4919,Great game
4920,Challenging.
4921,"This was my entry point into the Civilization franchise. I have since played it and the successor Civilization VI for ~1700 hours total. 

Highly recommended."
4922,fun game if your looking for a game
4923,this is one of the best games I have played.
4924,Gorgeous graphics and deep combat make this a great place to start or renew your interest in global domination.
4925,Good game.
4926,
4927,Seems to work well on my Macbook..
4928,"Loved the zoomable detailed graphics and available mods list is huge! ... hours of fun (but in single player mode, once you've learned it's strategy patterns it becomes easier to beat)"
4929,Good game
4930,Great game to just chill and zone off into and has great music
4931,nice
4932,YES VERY GOOD
4933,Its fun while easy to get the hand of.
4934,"When I played Civ 5 for the first time a bunch of hot Korean babes showed up at my house.

4936,"I am contractually obligated to provide a positive review. I love this game, great gameplay, nice graphics, wonderful difficulty curve, even the multiplayer is great. The only thing I would change about this game is [redacted]."
4937,"One of the most refined and re-playable games ever.  Hardly any glitches. Very challenging at higher levels. 
I have played this game over and over again and the strategy changes every time. Simply great.
"
4938,"i didnt like this game at all, not my type of game"
4939,its a great game
4940,"I have no life, only Civ.  Get this game if you want to never see another human again."
4941,"Great game.

Linux Users:
Game randomly crashes but you can fix the problem if you are running the game natively by adding the following to launch options

Launch options: taskset -c 0-6 %command%

I have not had any problems with the game after doing this."
4942,wewe
4943,Best Strategy game i have played!
4944,"I once named my religion ""Carl's Jr."" i think you can guess what symbol i chose for the religion..."
4945,"just stop lying to yourself that you will open this game, play it for an hour, and then go back to school/work. there will be a lot more after ""Just this one more turn."""
4946,Very addictive and creativ.
4947,It was all going so well until Gandhi got the bomb
4948,it’s an ok game i guess
4949,"Sid Meier's has not disappointed with this title. I've enjoyed the gameplay and balance of the game as well as the multiplayer aspect, when you have friends to join that is. The experience you can expect to have is fairly straight forward with its textbox tutorial, however, you pick it up relatively quick. If you practice with various ways to develop your civilization you'll soon find out what works for you! 8/10!

Pros:
Dynamic Gameplay
Functioning Systems, such as multiplayer servers
Straight Forward yet deep complexity!
RTS! Some people like it!

Cons:
Dated Graphics
Some minor bugs
...RTS? Some people don't like it."
4950,The best version of Civilization. VI gets too slow and too complicated for my taste V is the version!
4951,Ghandi was really into enemas for some reason
4952,Keep playing as America...keep trying to nuke everyone and taking over the world...wait that was Civilization 5... not real life....
4953,very addicting
4954,Still holds up brilliantly. Easy to learn but with huge depth that makes it hard to master and offers replayability.
4955,better than 6 lmao
4956,Its a very historical game with loads of cool characters to choose from that have unique units. There is nothing to bad about this game its just so enjoyable.
4957,good and addictive
4958,"Terrible AI, do not recommend."
4959,It's good.
4960,This game has nearly destroyed my relationship. 10/10
4961,"very, umm, fun and interesting. lots of strategy and kinda relaxing"
4962,You like games that never end?
4963,awesome
4964,i've spent so many hours of my life in here
4965,have played this since the very first one.  this version is excellent.  have lost several hours at a time.  Just one more turn & i'll kill them off.
4966,A good civilization game despite all its flaws. Definitely worth playing.
4967,"Awesome strategy game. 
"
4968,If you love strategy games this one is for you!
4969,"This game can get boring after a while as games can take hours or days, but as a virgin and a single father I'm someone who played this game for 69 hours a feet that most men strive for. 10/10 makes you really feel like Genghis Khan"
4970,"M A H A T M A.

Don't believe his lies."
4971,Great for relaxation
4972,simply the best of its genre
4973,"V is better that VI.  Dont let anyone tell you otherwise.  They have half a brain if they think VI is better than V.  Trust me.  Permanent builders mixed in with the whole entire world declaring war on you when you completely wipe a civ, its one of my favorite games HANDS ON"
4974,"Bad writing by Rex Martin yet again, not as good as ""oonum scronum"". fun game tho"
4975,gud
4976,I think I'll need another 500 hours on the game to confirm if its good or not.
4977,lots of challenging achievements

4982,classic
4983,Best.  Game.  Ever.  Replaced Civ 3 for that title a while back and may only ever be unseated by a later Civ.
4984,BEST CIV hands down!

4988,GOOD
4989,Its great
4990,fav game of all time
4991,The layout is great Ive been playin Ohrpg turn based games since I had a 286dx in 91 . excellent game for group of friends
4992,good game well made
4993,Meh
4994,"too complicated for me, maybe one day I'll have the patience to play it"
4995,Its a really good game
4996,"Solid game, all rounder in my opinion"
4997,Probably yes
4998,I have played Civilization since Civ3 and still enjoy it
4999,"Time sink, great"
5000,Super
5001,yep
5002,"While better than civ 6, there are two things that prevent a recommendation from me here.

1. There is no baked in support for modded multiplayer. Thats right, in a game that advertises both modding, and multiplayer, prominently on the store page, you can't combine the two. Heck, you can't even play the DLC scenarios multiplayer.

2. The launcher. For some reason, the game got an update YEARS after civ 6 was released, that enabled an external launcher. This would be all well and good, if it maybe gave some features, or something, but instead, it did TWO things. First, it made it so in order to boot up the game, you had to have Civ 6 advertised to you. Second, it made it so an external program that would let you play modded multiplayer, simply wouldnt work. Thankfully, the launcher is optional, able to be opted out of through steam's oft-forgotten betas feature, but its still an update that actively goes out of its way to interfere with the modded experience, unless you, the customer, go out of your way to fix the issue."
5003,To me this is the benchmark of strategy games.
5004,This is a great game. Played for over a hundred hours and have not even come close to trying all the different ways to win. Great replay value
5005,I played for 16 hours and still haven't finished the game I started. #YesDaddy
5006,"Of the many games I own, this is the one I return to again and again over the years because it never gets old and remains challenging. I've never been tempted to move on to CIV VI. WARNING: you may find as I do that you can't break away from this game and hours pass without notice. You may even stay up all night playing it. I've logged close to 4000 hours. I highly recommend you be retired before you buy Civ V."
5007,Civ 6 didnt even bother including a demographics feature. It would seem like a game about building empires would definitely include how many people are in your empire. Hard for me to even try to enjoy it once i figured that out. Deleted it after about an hour. Civ 5 is the sweet spot in the series for me.
5008,"It's Civ, duh."
5009,Yyyy
5010,e
5011,k
5012,I spend wayyy too much time on this series.
5013,I've played all Civ games from Dos to Windows to Dosbox and Civ 5 is the best.
5014,good game
5015,Its awesome
5016,"The best of the best - the franchise reached it's current peak here, in my view."
5017,I have straight up lost whole weeks of my life to civ5. Highly recommend and still holds up even to civ6. Make sure to grab the Brave New World expansion if you're buying for the first time.
5018,"Much better with all DLC and possibly mods than Civ 6, would recommend this way more"
5019,why does george washington look at me and not say anythhing
5020,OH yes zo wee mama big good
5021,super fun
5022,love sim games this is a great one
5023,.
5024,hood certified classic
5025,"Probably the best of the Civilization franchise, much better than Civ 6."
5026,"Played this a lot when it came out. Tried again recently. Buggy, crashes for no reason, the AI cheats, and most games aren't actually fun."
5027,Great game
5028,I like the game because I played a lot of Rome total war and strategy games are always fun for me.
5029,Good game
5030,it make me hard
5031,"Good game to waste a lazy day or even week. I love it, simple and fun yet can be complex as well."

5034,kill or capture?
5035,"good game,extremely replayable. if it gets boring up the difficulty. havnt played enough to give a full opinion but ill try my best"
5036,"Annoying long compelling game, you will loose days playing thisa"
5037,Best civ so far.
5038,I love this game more than George W. Bush loves false flag attacks on American soil.
5039,one of the best strategy games I have ever played
5040,"There are very few games as addicting as this one.  Each Civ game is unique in its own way, updating it and making it more intriguing and different while following the core setup.  I have never enjoyed a game as much as this one, learning and exploring history at the same time as exploring the idea of creating a new and different history in endless ""what if"" scenarios.  If you like building empires or enjoy war games, there are few that can match this one."
5041,Great game!
5042,Easy to learn and play
5043,louie is civ 1 beta footage
5044,CIV 5 > CIV 6
5045,I have played this game for a long time.  You should too. It might be good. (*Not a paid spokesperson)
5046,It is good
5047,5500 hours says it all
5048,The best strategy game ever made!
5049,Amazing.
5050,Gameing on videos gme not bad vido gmEEFD. NEW YOIRK BAAYBEEEE
5051,peepeepoopoo
5052,It`s ok.
5053,Good Game.
5054,With Brave New World this is the best civ game in existence. 11/10
5055,good game
5056,Really good strategy game!
5057,game was alright kinda glitchy
5058,"I have countless fond memories of playing this game throughout the years. Can't even begin to tell you how much fun I've had, and I will continue to play this game for years to come. Some like Civ VI better, but I'll stick to what I know and love. Civ V for life!!"
5059,I guess its alright
5060,"I bought the original back in the 90s and have played every version since.  Clever AI, good graphics -- Civ is very absorbing strategy game, my overall favorite turned-based digital board game - a brilliant waste of time."
5061,good game
5062,gewd
5063,cum fun
5064,"So much replay value. AI can be randomized along with the maps. 4 different victory types so you don't have to stick to 1 strategy. All around great game, and after buying Civ 6 this is still the one I go to when I have an itch to play."
5065,I like this game very much. I especially like the fact that everything adheres to a hexagonal grid unlike other civ games. I also enjoyed the complex tree systems and the strategy elements that were somewhat missing from other games.
5066,One.....more....turn....
5067,Fun game alone or with friends. Tons of replayability. Spent many hours on this game and still enjoy playing it.
5068,"cush
"
5069,A great way to get through a tough week.
5070,Awesome game
5071,It's a great old game that does not run all that well. Running it on Linux is especially painful... like the old sims games. Either way this is one of the best strategy games ever made.
5072,more than enough to fit about.
5073,700+ Hours Played. CIV V is still my favourite of all the series imo. They just nailed everything. Not over complicated and with a couple of balances and a couple of extra features in place would be polished perfect. However even still I thoroughly enjoy playing.
5074, They all rule as top games for the time they came out from Civ on win 3.1 to now
5075,Also fun if you play it more than once.
5076,"Published by an absolute dumpster fire of a company that never fails to break games post launch.
Don't bother with 2K, your games are never safe in their hands."
5077,"playing this game has made me much better at ""Jeopardy"""
5078,"Oh yes

Strikes a perfect balance of being approachable while also being very deep and advanced.
My favourite strategy game"
5079,Greet Geme
5080,Modern Chess!
5081,"fun civilization building with science tree and everything

5082,YES
5083,Good game
5084,meh
5085,"If you're going to buy Civilization V make sure you buy the Sid Meier version. I've played Arnold Ledbetter's Civilization V, Jessica Duller's Civilization V, L. Parson's Civilization V, Wilbur Henry Nathan Tolson Jr.'s  Civilization V and Meredith S. Bartholomew's Civilization V. The other's aren't bad, but Sid's is definitely the best."
5086,Waiting for the download while I write this. Nothing else to do. Good game.
5087,The greatest of all time.
5088,Addictive LOL
5089,love it
5090,"Extremely good game. I suggest getting it beacuse it's a world like game, with lots of strategies. There is also plenty of ways to win, my favourite being killing all the other civilization. 5/5!"
5091,This game is still far better then CIV 6.  CIV 6 is good but i feel like the game took one step forward and a bunch of steps back. CIV 5 is better
5092,This game is like heroin for autistic men. 10/10 would recommend playing while on heroin
5093,Best Civilization game ever.
5094,This game has ruined me for almost a decade 10/10
5095,"Civ V is a great game. Probably the only real turn based strategy game that I actually like. Only issue I have is that it is by 2K who are a pathetic company. 

Other than that I recommend it."
5096,fun
5097,It's good
5098,it is a fun strategy game
5099,"So I was just chillaxin in my province, two cities built, just straight farming

Then these French nibbas decided it was time for war for some reason

So anyways I started blastin and suddenly poof, no more French and now I own most of the Iron the continent LUL"
5100,GOOD GAME.
5101,"This game is so much fun to play! I love the fun historical facts and being able to learn more about historic figures, wonders, and technology."
5102,It will consume your soul.
5103,it gooder than 6
5104,"Pretty Fun, especially with friends. You can reach a point eventually where the rounds start to get boring."
5105,"very fun, very epic"
5106,"Smoother running, but you miss a lot of the options from earlier versions"
5107,"Best Civ game by far, and wouldn't pick any over it. It's great for new beginners and seasoned players. I would always recommend this one to players who want to start out playing a turn based game and if they feel they need something more in depth playing the Civ game that follows this. Now I do feel there is a bit of an imbalance depending on who you choose as ruler and there is a bit of an easy pick of what you want to end up majoring to win. But I feel that's what makes this game good for new players who want to feel good about playing. 100% would recommend!"
5108,Good fun.
5109,Buy it
5110,"-Takes a while to learn the policy tricks to advance your country.  
-People go into raging fits when you take a city, I don't understand why/how you can go from 20 happy to an up rise so quickly.  still working that bug out!
-Trade gives you to much, and you can't win the game without it."
5111,I liked the art design.  I disliked not being able to stack units
5112,"Decent, especially if you get to use the big booms and ruin the map xD
''Literally watching the world burn and you will be laughing in the background.''"
5113,"Nice game, classic one"
5114,Best Civ Game
5115,"The best civilization game ever made. Civ 6 added so much that the game became overwhelmingly complicated for the average player. This game however, is still awesome, and simple enough to learn and understand that anyone can and will enjoy it."
5116,4.21/7.5
5117,good
5118,Yes? Yes.
5119,very good! :)
5120,Too addictive. Please stop this. I am a student I don't have time to like this game as much as I do.
5121,The only game that I own that requires both an in game and out of game wikipedia to play.
5122,"I can confidently say that this is the best strategy game i have ever played. 

I also want to say that i think it is better than (The latest civ game at this time) Civ VI.

Definitely recommended"
5123,best game i have
5124,"There is no better CIV then CIV V, every comment is a comment to much in comparison to the garbage game which came after CIV V, its an actual insult to the game."
5125,its good
5126,I'm going to be honest this game is the best entry of the civilization games it has a lot of content a very active community and very lovable and simple game mechanics. SO bottom line is if you wanna start playing civilization start with this and move to the others. If this game is to expensive for you either wait for a sale or buy civilization 4 which is still an amazing game.
5127,"good level of detail, not too much to do each round"
5128,10/10; HIGHLY recommended!
5129,Better than Civ 6 lol
5130,still better than the VI imo
5131,way better than civ 6

5137,Fun game to play and to play the game and its fun and for fun to play good game
5138,Fun civilization building/micromanagement game.
5139,this is a great game
5140,fun game
5141,yep buy it
5142,"this game costs more than whatever price it is. it costs your time, teenage years, and most of all, your humanity. playing the game is like throwing away your soul into a bottomless pit. eventually you feel like there should be an end, but there is not. I've been playing this game on and off for around 4 years now. after every game me and my friends say we will never play it again, but we always come back. when i am married with kids, i will still be playing this game, when i retire, i will be playing this game, the  last thought i will ever have in my life is will god forgive me for the months i have wasted on this game. I do not recommend this game not because its bad, but its as if someone made dopamine into a game."
5143,its pretty cool
5144,Really great strategy game. Next thing to it is doing it in real life.
5145,"Gandhi with Nukes 
10/10 REAL"
5146,Best Strategy game going
5147,"Sid Meier? More like, Sid Try-Hard! Just kidding, he tried his best and made this. Only him. No dev team. Just Sid. Also this game doesn't sell your information like another Sid Meier game does, so that's also nice. I made a Great Prophet so this game can make a Great Profit. Bars"
5148,yes
5149,"Of all the Civ games, this one remains my favorite. 

However for some reason recently it decided to stop working. I can't even get the game to attempt to load... I have uninstalled and reinstalled. My computer is significantly above all specs required to play it... No idea if a patch was done that broke the game but hopefully this gets fixed...?"
5150,Just one more turn
5151,"Another classic iteration of Sid Meier's successful Civilization series.  Still holds up extremely well, even ten years later."
5152,"Very addicting game, it's hard to pick if I like Civ V or Civ VI better."
5153,legendary game
5154,my only con: I keep playing this and ignoring the rest of my library
5155,Good game.
5156,haha nuke go brrr
5157,it good
5158,The CIV franchise is my favorite video game series.  Hands down.
5159,I AM THE GREATEST EMPIRE OF ALL TIME!!!
5160,Great game
5161,"I have a Civ addiction. Nothing keeps my insomnia company like this game does. One more turn becomes one more hour, which then becomes 2:30am. I'm not even good at the game."
5162,got to be one of the best games ever
5163,Completely addictive!!
5164,Probably the best installment in the Civ franchise to date.
5165,Great game. use some mods for a better experience
5166,Best game ever
5167,its sick
5168,"Baba Yetu still better, but limoncello good as well!"
5169,this game ruined my life
5170,Classic strategy game
5171,"Don't get me wrong, the gameplay is incredibly fun. 

However, ladies and gentlemen, this videogame has the absolute s**tiest netcode I've ever seen. Every single time I try to play this piece of s**t with my friends, it becomes unplayable after some random number of turns. 

Wanna play it alone? Great, go ahead. Planning on playing with friends? Don't waste your precious money; just look elsewhere."
5172,Easily the best game of the franchise by a landslide. Enough said.
5173,There's nothing like the classics.
5174,Its pretty k
5175,GG
5176,"Civ seems like one of those games that was revolutionary in its time, but did not evolve with time. The UI is awful and has no tutorial or information about how to play."
5177,love love love

"
5179,"I like civ
"
5180,The hours played speaks for itself.
5181,i normally hate these types of games but i tried it out cause my friends told me to at least try it and now im hooked
5182,"One of my favorite Civ's out of the bunch other then Civ II that holds some cherished memories:) 

I could play this game for hours and you will.
Just...one ....more ...turn"
5183,"I have never been good at strategy games. Most of the time, I am guessing at what to do next, even when close to 1k hours.

Still, I cannot get enough of Civ V. It's my favorite in the series, regardless of the harsh criticism this game received. I love the reactions of the leaders, and making my cities as happy as possible. That is no easy feat.

I do not have much else to say about this. I really wish I did. I cannot even say if I should recommend it, because grand strategy is so hard to pin down on who will like it or not."
5184,Even tho this game came out a while ago it is still a very fun game
5185,Definitely one of my favorites
5186,"very good game would recommend if you cant get CIV6 
one problem is that you have to get all the dlcs to fix the bugs but they are worth it"
5187,;kn;kljb
5188,you can play ghandi and use d e t e r r e n c e
5189,just so addictinjg once you get the hang of it just learn the game a bit trust me
5190,"The ""just one more turn"" meme is completely true, because you'll need to spend hours simply advancing time with no meaningful or impactful consequences on the immediate state of the gameplay and board."
5191,exelent game a bit too easy but overall a great experience and with all the mods the game doesn't realy get old and the ai is smarter than you might expect
5192,Probably my favorite Civ game
5193,I live to serve Catherine
5194,haha @royalgutz call me india because you can sugandhiz nuts
5195,"Classic and great.

Would definitely recommend using the NQ-mod which substantially improves the game."

5197,"ifin u wanna a challenge try the achievements  some  are damn near impossible.

"
5198,"You can repeat it endlessly.. This is how game should be made...'
"
5199,One of the best games ever
5200,"Compared to earlier Civ games, I feel that this is the most balanced. It's really fun to play through as different civilizations, truly experience their unique attributes and how these uniquely impact gameplay. Would definitely recommend to other players!"
5201,"Great game, super fun!"
5202,Was a fun time
5203,good game
5204,love this game great with friends
5205,"2172 hours on track, would play 10000 more"
5206,Better than VI
5207,10/10
5208,"This game is by far one of the greatest game I have ever played. To explain how good this game is I once had a girl over while I was in the middle of a run and instead of doing the big dirty with her I choose to play through the campaign while she sat on my bed on her phone, she did not come over again. Would do again 10/10"
5209,Rome
5210,Simply great
5211,"GOOD
"
5212,"A great casual strategy game to enjoy alone or even better with friends. I never thought I'd enjoy playing this but my mate from work got me into it and I find myself enjoying playing this in the background whilst doing other things.
Worth checking it out for sure."
5213,It's a great game. If you're not careful hours will pass without you realizing it.
5214,old game but good game
5215,"The Civilization series are one of those rare games that when you start and intend to play for a few hours tends to burn your day away.  It's fun and unique visual appearance helps define it as it's own entity, along with the constant fear that Gandhi will be sending hundreds of nukes your direction.  Along with a great modding community, this game will never grow stale."
5216,"Hiawatha and Ghandi invaded my French hamlet of knights and lancers with tanks and gunmen to steel my cotton.

10/10, would get destroyed again"
5217,Loved the game since it came out. Started playing the series in the early 90s... a true classic that peaked at Civ 5 for me. Wish Steam made it easier to see what DLC I already have.
5218,Modding community is keeping Civ 5 alive frfr
5219,The better Alternative if you don't want to buy/play Civ VI. Just as good and the Addons/Mods available make it shine even more. Really time consuming and makes you feel like you've played for 10 mins when really you've played for 10 hours.... Straight..... God they were fun.
5220,Very fun to play
5221,"FUCKN GOOD. 

PLAY IT."
5222,You can name your cities and religion racist stuff and its funny haha
5223,"As I sleep at night, Gandhi watches me through my computer. He can not do much, but he tries. The smug look on his face puts me in my place. I was safe for a while until I see Gandhi in the atomic era. It was a rush for life or death. I was drowning in my own sweat knowing the inevitable was about to come. Heart beating like a drum when he declared war. I am a man of simple means, but in no way did Gandhi have the right to drop 9 atomic bombs on my cities..."
5224,Played a bit. Though it was fun. Will play a bit more.
5225,Just one more turn...
5226,"First, I'll address the elephant in the room: the 14,000 hours.  I'd say I only had the game on a screen for about 5000.*  That is still way more than I've played anything else, and a clear sign of how much I liked this game.  The one-more-turn addictiveness kept me awake many nights when ""I have work tomorrow"" was a perfectly good reason to stop.  Like most 4x games, this one really rewards playing wide, but there is at least some room for tall play as well.  Clearly I found a lot of replay value in it.  I do have to admit, though, that I've moved on to other games and now only play this one for a few hours once every few months or so.  I spent most of my time playing the game with mods, and last I looked, they were pretty much all still there.  The built in mod support is excellent.  

* I mostly played with Gedemon's Huge Earth mod with true start locations and packed in most of the available Civs.  This caused severe stability issues, especially when loading games.  I found I could get at least 100 extra turns in on one of these games if I just left the game on all the time, so I'm guessing (by my playtime in HOI4 and Stellaris) that I probably only had the game actually on screen for about 5000 hours, and a fair amount of that was AFK or half paying attention while watching a movie or TV on another screen. It is a turn based game, after all.  Most of the 14,000 hours I was actually asleep, at work, walking my dog... I apologize to future generations for the carbon pollution, but I still had tons of fun with it."
5227,"Buy it. This game is a masterpiece, one of the best strategy games I've ever played and probably my favorite, every game you do is different with a different start and with the DLC you can chose what ideology you want, and when the multiplayer isn't being buggy and mess it's a beautiful thing. 10/10"

5230,"I'm fucking retarded when it comes to strat games 

I got this so id be less shit at fps games

apparently I also really enjoy RTS games 

Worth buying on sale n shit"
5231,I actually like this version more than the later version.
5232,"if you fall asleep you dont get wiped out
"
5233,"This the standard for Civilization.  Classic and historically accurate characters, not cartoon representations.  You'll be playing this for years, especially if you want those Steam achievements and have OCD."
5234,This is the best of the civ games. Play it!
5235,"Even thogh its old, it is still a very good game, representing the core of the civ games in my opinion."
5236,an utterly amazing game
5237,"I mean, it's Civ V, it's great !"
5238,good graphics and extremely interesting

5243,Awesome everything!
5244,fun coop and chill
5245,♥
5246,The best of the CIV games.  CIV VI is too complicated and cumbersome to get a good feel for so I don't even bother.  I come back to this game and try the randomizer for extra challenge.  5 big gold stars and a 10 out of 10!
5247,Fantastic city builder and nation management game. its a classic and i will always recommend it.
5248,"I recently bought CIV VI and lost interested pretty quickly. 
I turned back to CIV V and the game successfully distracts me from studying now.
Fun and well balanced.

Also I changed the title music to Baba Yetu from CIV IV ;)"
5249,The best game ever made.
5250,.
5251,love it
5252,"Very nice game, cant stop playing"
5253,"I enjoyed playing civ 5 alot with friends. Very friendly to learn, not sure how it compares to 6 much but great fun with your mates if you've got a long time, and you can save it if you want to revisit it."
5254,if you want to lose track of time and take over the world then this game is right for you
5255,"its good, but it could be better. i understand that there is a new civ out but you cannot just leave this one like it was nothing. the thing that could be most improved is the graphics. overall i would recommend if you have hoi 4 or games like that. if you dont have those games go and buy them imo they are better then this one
"
5256,one of my all time favorite multiplayer and hot seat games. my husband and friends and i can sit and play this game for an entire day and have an absolute blast. 10/10 recommend.
5257,Its fun
5258,Beautiful Game
5259,very good
5260,If you absolutely have to invest time in accomplishing nothing at all.

5263,Excellent replay value. One of my all-time favorites.
5264,Всё ещё лучше Humankind.
5265,This game will suck away your life turn by addictive turn. Recommending this game to a friend is like asking them to try some heroin with you. 10/10.
5266,"Really deep strategy game. A lot of fun to be had if you like playing board games by yourself, lol. But really, it's a beautiful game, and you can play it a ton of different ways. 

Criticisms are that you don't really know if you are on the right track til its pretty much too late. So you could spend like 9 hours on a game just to randomly lose. But I mean, you can't win them all. After a while the game feels a little repetitive, I know I said you can play it a ton of different ways, but I have over 150 hours on this game. Eventually, it feels repetitive. But still worth it, great game!

Oh, and I love all the history tied into the game too. Just great!"
5267,Always enjoyable watching smaller empires fall before you
5268,"This new launcher people are complaining about is rubbish. 

If you can get it to work, the game is great!"
5269,fun
5270,I can has nukes
5271,"great game, one of the best in the series"
5272,I like it berry much. happy fun time. berry berry good
5273,pretty epic
5274,"Still has some things better about it than Civ 6, some players could definitely justify playing Civ 5 over the newer model, especially if you are on a budget this will hold up fine."
5275,good time waster
5276,My mom got us hooked on this game when we were kids and now we all play together. After a certain point I have no clue what I am doing but I still have fun.
5277,Great game.  Good for hours of enjoyable game play.  highly recommended.
5278,I like the choices to use mods and the plethora of civilizations to chose from
5279,Works with Proton on Linux
5280,My favorite CIV so far. I just got CIV VI and am excited to try it but I have spent hundreds of hours playing CIV over the years and this is my favorite.
5281,"Outstanding game. By far THE best of all the CIV versions I have played, including CIV VI."
5282,"Just love this game, with our without the community mod. i have spend days on marathon  mode, but thats just the best :-D  whoever doenst know the game, it is wearth buying it.

5294,"For some reason, every time I think about the game my body can't resist the urge to launch the game and play for hours at a time. Sometimes I don't even notice how fast time passes by whenever I play this game. It's like the game is hallucinating me and telling me to play more and more, every turn I make I can't stop playing it's like the game is telling me to not stop playing till I reach what I really desire in life, rest in peace to my sleep schedule. The sensation I feel whenever I play this game is comparable to how a person experiences euphoria in their life, except for my side; I get indulged into playing a 12 year old game for hours at a time... oh yeah the game is fun."
5295,"My friend got mad at me for building stone hedge and told me ""stay in your lane bean slur word"" it was a fun night before that. After that he apologized and said that he loved me which i thought was sus. So yeah i recommend the game ig"

5303,"Man, I can't believe I didn't review this game until now. This is one of my favorite games of all time, narrowly beating the sixth game in the series and just behind Stellaris. This game is strategic and about as minimally luck-based as a game with randomized starts can get. (We do not Talk about the ""five snow one iron"" start.) Community mods are ambitious and can fix pretty much any problems I have with the game. 10/10."
5304,"Yes, certainly an excellent game if you want turn based and not shoot-em-up.  I actually prefer it to Civ VI because I dislike the horrible sepia colour in that over everything you can't see properly - much preferred the misting out in V.

Civ V is still a complex game with much to think about and, if you've not tried the series before, much to learn but in a reasonable way.  The learning curve is not ridiculously steep."
5305,Great it's a classic honestly
5306,Probably the best Civ game. Long live hexes!
5307,Great game that you lose so much time to
5308,good game much dlc

5347,"I am 72.

My ex-wife and I have a daughter together, and adopted our son together. They are now both 4 years old.

When we were going through our separation, I found myself lost and miserable. I was self destructive. I got so mad one day from everything spiraling out of my control that I punched some concrete in a moment of overwhelming emotion. That caused me to break my 5th metacarpal in my right hand... my working hand... my games hand.. the hand that I held and carried my children to bed with.. The hand I desperately needed to make sure I could continue to provide.

After learning of the severity of my self-inflicted damage, I was borderline suicidal. Keep in mind that just a few months before this, I was the happiest man with no history of depression or anxiety. I have never had fits of rage, or been one to break down and cry, but I was in a low spot that just really buried me from being able to see the light on the other side.

Having nothing better to do, I searched for a game I could play, ONE HANDED while I recovered. I somehow stumbled upon this game and read some of the reviews. I decided that it had to be worth a shot... I must admit, I didn't beat the game, or play nearly as long as some of you. In fact, I may have only played this game a day or two.. With that being said, after doing so, I had a new found joy and hope for life. I was able to put behind me the pain and suffering that had been cast over me. I was able to experience other peoples joy and happiness. I was able to see the fruits of my ""labor"". I relaxed for 5 ♥♥♥♥ing minutes to this music long enough to realize that I was going to be okay.

After coming to that realization, I turned the game off, and I went back to work. It hurt my hand like hell but I was motivated. I stopped feeling so damn sorry for myself, and I became the father I needed to be in that moment, not the weak boy I was behaving as.

Today, I am close friend with my kids mother. We don't fight, or argue, or say hurtful things to each other. We are parents, and friends.

I now have 3 kids. My third child is, wait for it, ALSO 4 YEARS OLD. The woman I am with was going through a very similar situation at the time of my own separation, and we just stumbled in to each others life unexpectedly. We have been in a relationship for a year now, and are very happy together.

Moral of the story, you never know what life holds in store for you, and if I would have given up when all the odds were stacked against me, I wouldn't be where I am today. This silly little game helped me realize that.

Thank you."

5355,Fantastic game that is improved even further with community mod packs.
5356,Good game.
5357,"played the game on level 8 Difficulty, absolutely awsome. Greece, the same faction that almost wiped me out in the beginning of the game later become my best ally against the waves of invading russians, ottomans, and french. Nukes flying everywhere, soldiers getting blown up by airstrikes and giant death robots. Loved it the entire time."
5358,I love this game at the time but now it feels very outdated
5359,"Unlike Civ 3 and Civ 4, Civ 5 only allows 1 military unit in each tile.  This is a big change and offer experienced players a bigger advantage in combats vs AI as the units are less likely to be overwhelmed.  This makes winning on Deity difficulty standard Pangaea map easier. 

Civ 5 offers a wide range of strategic options, from how close to settle the cities, tech research priorities, whether to rush for a wonder, to diplomatic and war decisions.  The well designed part of Civ 5 is that each strategy has its own pros and cons, and there isn’t any strategy being clearly superior than others.  This balance in different strategies make sure the decision makings remain meaningful. 

DLC offers new mechanics and several scenarios.  Scenarios typically have preset cities, limited tech research and different victory conditions.  Deity difficulty scenarios are much easier to beat compared to deity difficulty standard Pangaea games.

Achievements in this game require a lot of time and patience.  A significant amount of achievements are scenarios related and require the player to play through the scenario with multiple difficulties.  The scenario based deity difficulty achievements are the most difficult achievements in the game, especially the ones in Scramble for Africa."

5399,"There aren't a lot of good turn based strategy games and this is one of them.

Something to add, though. One of the patches wrecked the end game by making it a political battle. Adding things like embargoing city-states and the like, without being able to ignore the embargo if you choose (like real world politics) turns this into a very unrealistic game."

The hotseat feature is one of my favorite as I am an old school wargamer who still has about 20 boardgames, avalon hill , etc. from the old days and playing hotseat is very much like playing one of the old games from my youth.

It is a fantastic game and I highly recommend !!!"

Would recommend but this game broke my good pal Chromaray. He has never been the same since. He constantly makes CIV5 references and somehow brings everything around to CIV 5. He has an addiction and a legit problem. He has sacrificed so much to this game. Anytime he to refers real world events he will add that it is from CIV 5. ""Oh, George Washington! Like the leader from CIV5!""

I can't escape from this stupid game and its constantly in my life. I need therapy for this, its the worst."

The only downside to it is that there is a lot to learn so you if you want something simple or don't have time to just sit and grind through a game I wouldn't recommend. If you do have time to sit and learn it for a while then I'm willing to bet you'll enjoy it as much as I am."

5446,"Civ V is the best Civilization game I have played (II, III, IV, V). I think of all of those, it has aged the best as well. The only complaint is that they withheld a lot of the core mechanics in the initial release to be added later in the two expansions. Every strategy game does this now. Looking at you Crusader Kings III. But now that the definitive edition of Civ V is out, I'll go back to giving this a full recommend."

It takes many hours to master it and even after playing over 1300 hours just the base game, still find it very hard to beat the max difficulty, but it has been a very satisfactory challenge to beat.
If you are a casual strategy player, you'll find it fun to play in the lower levels as well, if you have the patience to understand the basic mechanics.
The real complexity applies mostly to the highest level were you can prove yourself as a true conqueror of civilization.
"
5470,Love this game..
5471,"fun game to play with your family
"
5472,another great civ title once all the DLC is applied
5473,
5474,I stole Uranium from Octavian Augustus.
5475,Best strat game out there
5476,"Better than civ 6 and 7,8... maybe 9 will be better, lets hope."
5477,The classic. Definitely better with the DLC but the game is the pinnacle of the civilization series.
5478,The best all round CIV game in there franchise (For me that is of course).
5479,good
5480,kkr goeie wel
5481,"Just, one, more, turn"
5482,This game is digital heron it scores a 10/10 fun childhood
5483,Addicting... I haven't spent 6 hours in one sitting on one game in a very long time. This game has taken over all my free time!!
5484,I have so far played this game for 1270 hours and on top of that also previous and later versions. There is just something catchy about building a civilization. The race to develop technologies etc. I just love it.
5485,goated
5486,i like it
5487,Need to kill time?
5488,Love this game Civ best game ever
5489,loved it.
5490,"Just one more turn...

Yeah, it's addictive and as complex as you want it to be. A truly great game."
5491,"The greatest thing about this game is it's endless replayability.  With so many different cultures and maps, especially with Mods, no game is the same.  Beware though, too many Mods can bog the game down, especially buildings Mods."
5492,"This game has something for everyone and works with those of all skill levels. I personally prefer this game to CIV 6, especially with all of the DLC installed."
5493,Good.
5494,stuff
5495,Yes
5496,"Played it for more than 4000 hours.
Nothing more to say :-P"
5497,No Better than CIV 4
5498,The Brave New World content really expands the game - making this totally replayable
5499,good game for joe biden lovers
5500,It's a good stand by game.  Played it for years.
5501,
5502,"I have been playing civ as a series since it came out.  This, stunningly enough, is the most thin, unexciting and poor version yet.  From the irritating dingles to the flimsy gameplay and thoroughly unrealistic ability of a city to be targetted by 20-30 nuclear devices and remain surprisingly untouched.  The AI cheats like an SoB and I see that our galaxy brains have not expanded enough to fix that simple problem with Ghandi yet.  

It's a feature is it?  Blink...  No, it's a programming fail from long ago that no one has bothered to fix.  Not even nostalgia for other versions of the game could save this one.  I tried, I really tried to enjoy it, hoping something would stun me - that the tech tree might be half as interesting as the one from Alpha Centauri, but nope.

Very, very not worth your time.  I tried it so you don't have to."
5503,Played it 66 hours in the first week. Wonderful game.
5504,A nice game. Haven't played in awhile but I remember it was a lot of fun to play when I did
5505,Its a classic strategy game and style of gameplay that is shared among many games in this genre. One Day I may update to the newer version but this one still works well enough for me.
5506,"Digital Heroin, still relevant over a decade later."
5507,It's Sid Meier's Civilization.  'Nuff said.
5508,977 hours and counting
5509,Cool
5510,great game
5511,just one more turn
5512,Fun for my taste
5513,like
5514,"My boyfriend recommended this as an easy introduction to video games. I'd tried others and found the mechanics too hard as a beginner but Civ V is easy for anyone to learn. :) Also, just because it's easy to learn doesn't mean it's boring. I've spent far too many hours on this game already - it's too fun!"
5515,Love building Kingdoms.
5516,its been years and i keep coming back =']
5517,Great game
5518,It's an interesting step on from Civ IV. No MSODs allowed in this version.
5519,"Great, deep, and entertaining game. DLC adds even more when the base game runs out of challenge. Well worth the price."
5520,I GET TO BE GEORGE WASHINGTON HOLY FUCK
5521,is fun
5522,addictive
5523,"It's alright, might play for another 1726 hours."
5524,This game is a classic and is absolutely so much fun.
5525,Awesome
5526,Addicting bullshit.
5527,"Sid Meier enough said
"
5528,I love this game so much
5529,"Only 6 hours in and my wife already left me
"
5530,"I've played this game for over 450 hours now. If that isn't recommendation enough then I don't know what is! The sheer volume of different maps, win conditions and play styles keeps me playing and trying new things."
5531,"This Game is fire ! I mean Civilization IV looks good but this is a good one too, I say get them both ."
5532,"Gandhi's achievement is ""Give peace a chance"" It is true after you nuke every other civ."
5533,I have spent way too many hours on this game and cannot recommend it enough. Becoming an evil dictator with the ability to destroy everyone in an instant is fun.
5534,"ever wanted to make your friends play a game for 50 hours just for them to lose to Gandhi with nukes, then this is the game for you."
5535,Very good
5536,I mean.. it's CIV.
5537,"It's old...but, awesome....been playing this game off and on for well over 10 years..."
5538,5/5
5539,"Civ V was the first Civilization game i ever played, and i am glad it was. It set the standard for what a Civ game is supposed to be.

The flavor of the different nations, the maps, resources, warfare, diplomacy, victory conditions, all of it is amazing.

If you like turn-based strategy games, definitely pick it up, you will get your money's worth.

10/10"
5540,great strategy game and endless hours of fun.
5541,Great strategy game
5542,"Been playing Civ games since I was young and they still hold their ground now, I can easily spend hours messing around and having fun.

Amazing game, 

9.5/10"
5543,"i would like to see more campain time waring countries time periods need more detail in enviorments
"
5544,"It's a great game, great attention to detail, I've played this game for 6 years and it still feels like it came out recently. Incredible game"
5545,Best Civ Ever
5546,This is the perfect strategy game for a group of friends looking to just spend hours building armies and fighting each other
5547,I've played this game for almost 600 hours and I'm still not bored of it. Says it all really.
5548,pretty good
5549,its awesome
5550,this game sux.
5551,top 5 game all time
5552,"Classic and still the best Civ game made
"
5553,"Easily the best Civ game. Its worth every penny (and also get brave new world because oh my god its so good)

Civ 6 sucks don't @ me

"
5554,Ruined my life. 10/10 would play just one more turn.
5555,"It's civilization. I like V better than VI.

I'm an old school Civ player and I just can't get into VI, but I really like V. I bet VI is really good too which I own and play, but suck at or lose interest. Something about V is just more fun."
5556,"This game is something great to play while listening to podcasts. Especially Dan Carlin, everyone reading this should try listening to Dan Carlin's podcasts while playing this game. It's one of those games you play when want to listen to something but also want to do an activity while listening."
5557,it good
5558,Multiplayer kind janky sometimes
5559,"It says I've played this game for 1875 hours, so it must be okay. This version of Civ added districts (awesome) and hexes (awesome). I don't remember if this was the first game to prevent unit stacking, but I love that too. The city defense is also great, although it was pretty funny to invade another civilization on turn 10 and take their capital ending their civilization because they're out exploring."
5560,The best Civ game by far. Feels refined and balanced and the mods are amazing.
5561,"I've put a lot of thought into this.

I recommend this game."
5562,great
5563,it's good
5564,"Fun game, not historically accurate."
5565,nukes. Ghandi. Same Game. Perfect.
5566,it makes me fill warm inside
5567,This game will eat your life.
5568,Loved the World Map rendering on this version much more so than Civ 6
5569,The OG game that's going to make you play it until 3 AM.
5570,its the best sid meiers game out there.
5571,good game. conquer alot. would play again
5572,Its an old ass game and im still playing it.  its like skyrim.  it will always be good.
5573,Stupid fun game that you can waste hours playing.
5574,amazing game
5575,"Love this game so much.  Not perfect; the interactions with other leaders are pretty superficial and there are other  interactive aspects that could be improved, but overall this game is so much fun and a solid win.

Every few years I re-install it and come back to play again.  Just can't get enough I guess.
"
5576,"Its fun. I've finished 2 games, started many more"
5577,Best game of the series in my view.
5578,one if not my favorite entries to this franchise
5579,"Fun shit for when the homies are drunk, high, and sober."
5580,"Nuclear is fine, just don't send its code."
5581,"i had a lot of hours in this game so i reccomended it to my friend and now they have more hours in this game than me 

0/10 fuck sid meier"
5582,I regret my decision
5583,I like the mellow nature and long term rewards for making good choices.
5584,This game is big stinky. Makes me want to make do-do. 10/10
5585,"cool game, like play 1v1 with friends"
5586,Just another great addition to the Civilization series.
5587,Better than VI
5588,"9/10

The first PC strategy game i got into, so glad i gave it a chance. what a phenomenal game. 
highly recommend it but like every strategy game get the complete edition for the full experience."
5589,"Has its core elements, hard game to get into, but if you didn't fail your IQ test, it's a pretty good game

5591,"   Great strategy game that holds no punches when it comes to challenging the player. The long games really encourage long-term strategizing, but the speeds at which the tides can turn also require the player to think in the moment as well."
5592,"gud game, fun times, lots of mods.

A solid 12/10
"
5593,Adictive!!!!
5594,Just...one...more...turn...
5595,game good
5596,Great strategy and tactics game
5597,its slow but yeah cool thumbs up
5598,Love it!
5599,Always a good way to 'waste' an evening
5600,this game totally sucks. if i wanted to cut my balls off and down in a vat of acid for the pure pain id be better of playing this fucking awful game. it is so boring i hate to even look at the pictures of it. the game play makes u sleepy and has nothing interesting ever happening. awful awful awful game
5601,best civ ever
5602,"Civ V is the ideal strategic game. You can adjust to your level of experience. Historically you begin in ancient times and progress in complexity to modern times. You can play against the computer or online with friends. Graphics are realistic, music is synchronized to the country, and using Max Von Sidow as the voice over on events is brilliant."
5603,thanks matt :)
5604,yes.
5605,GOOD
5606,Yes. Just do it. You won't. Coward.
5607,so amazing
5608,Lots of hexagons..... good
5609,An incredible strategy game.  I do prefer Civ 6 slightly though.
5610,"Labai patiko.
"
5611,"For some reason whenever I play this game my right ball begins to hurt. 
Other than the ball pain this game is a 9/10."
5612,"Ive been playing this game since it first came out, and I haven't stopped playing. Its great graphics and combat make the game a great experience. The resources system is simple- not over complex. Politics were created to be as interactive as possible, i feel. Overall, a great game."
5613,good
5614,my friend annoyed me to play this game so much im trying now
5615,rollin up in world war 2 with bow and arrows really make me worried
5616,Can't beat CIv V. Great game!
5617,me gusta
5618,It's a decent game.
5619,Mind the sunrise
5620,"Yes, would definitely recommend!"
5621,"Days, man. Hours of fun. I'm talkin' minutes."
5622,simply enjoyable
5623,very challenging and rewarding
5624,e iys gud
5625,Really fun! Great difficulty settings for all types of players. Can be as technical or non-technical as you'd like. You can play for a long time without getting bored. Different settings for how long you'd like the games to last as well.
5626,Civ rules
5627,"I don't usually like this type of game, but I enjoy CIV V, it's got a surface level simplicity that is easy to get into, while having a lot of deeper mechanics and things to learn as you play"
5628,Addiction is real
5629,"It is Interesting to see how civilization progress through the ages and how your decisions change the outcome.
You can get so involved into this game that you may not realize how much time has passed until you stop playing for the day. Then realize that there were other things that you wanted to get done but ran out of time."
5630,fun game and great time spender
5631,is good
5632,"The original Civ V has been ruined with the so called 'brave new world' content. It's now the same as Civ VI, which is terrible. 

Apart from dreadful content, there's now a problem with screen resolutions. It doesn't matter what size you select, you never see the full screen, or the screen is a tiny version at higher resolutions."
5633,"Good game, perfomance and game play I like,"
5634,Civ
5635,"As a first time player, hella overwhelming, but also hella fun. So much to do and oh my god I'm sick of these fucking barbarian s"
5636,The kind of game you can return to when in between other games. Solid pickup.
5637,I don't know if I didn't notice my first few times but there's an awful glitch that causes the game to count 2-5 mouse clicks for every one. (And I did troubleshoot this and its not my mouse) I can't even play a proper game because I'm inputting too many unknown and almost random orders to my units
5638,I'm a big fan of all of the Civilization games. It really comes down to how it helps me imagine what it would be like to live in another civilization in another time. It's fun to try to strategize and manage resources.
5639,it is fun
5640,...........just one more spliff
5641,Yes.
5642,I quit after about 5 minutes. Saved myself months of time.
5643,One of the best managerial games in history. 11/10
5644,"Love this game, especially with mods!"
5645,so fun lmao
5646,delitfullly
5647,fun
5648,"The best game of all times or very near to it.

Most features are even better than in overbloated Civ 6 (road building, civics, ...), although for the best experience I recommend map generating mod Perfect World."
5649,"I played as the Iroquis, befriended the Incans, Aztecs, and Shoshone and then destroyed America, Spain, France, and England.

10/10 game the only historical game where I can undo white people crimes"
5650,"Damn good game. If you are used to RTS its a bit disappointing in the beginning, and overwhelming as well. I suggest playing it without ANY DLC if you play it for the first time. Other than that, if you like it, theres content for two lifetimes (got the Complete Edition)."
5651,.
5652,"as always, great game. fun to play with friends and absolutely wreak havoc on all other countries"
5653,"ultimate time waster
"
5654,Constantly crashes when deep into the game. Hours of game time wasted :(
5655,Got this game because my friend wanted to play together played an hour he gave up and logged off so i went started a solo game and loved it and played for 28 hour in one sitting.
5656,trash game
5657,Great game i love it .
5658,good game
5659,Just... one... more... TURN.
5660,"This is THE game. Gotta go, it's my turn. :D"
5661,leuK!
5662,great game definetly recomend
5663,"It's one of the most relaxing, ""play it anytime"" games I've ever owned. You will almost certainly lose time while playing it, so make sure you schedule a cutoff every time you play."
5664,Better than Civ VI in my opinion :)
5665,Excellent turn-based strategy game. Absolutely addictive.
5666,"Still enjoyable, still challenging, still achievement hunting. Not replaced by VI, not better, not worse, they are different enough to be their own games with a similar feel."
5667,"""One more round"""
5668,Great Addictive Strategy Game.
5669,R.I.P my GPA
5670,"build one mega city, take over world"
5671,"Better than Civ 6. Even better with mods.
Very comfortable to play in my Jorts."
5672,"this game is a thing of beauty, I sit down and mindlessly move my mouse for 8 hours of my day. I literally accomplish nothing for the day except moving my little worker men around in circles. My life is pain and all I can show for it is my incorrect history knowledge from staring at pixels for hours upon hours. Existence is pain and life is a simulation inwhich I choose to be of the free mind whilst you all sit here and become sheep of the government. I will leave you with this little bit of advice, ignore society and rise above toilets. Shit your pants. DO it. DO. IT."
5673,"its good
"
5674,"Complex, historic, it is a game that is all about strategy. I love building world wonders. The UN is a lot of fun to navigate, as are the social policies and science tree. What kind of leader do you want to be? What kind of world to you wish to live in? Great graphics."
5675,Its a good game.
5676,it good
5677,"I could have learned a new language using the hours I spent playing this game. I hate how much I love it.

One. More. Turn."
5678,"Culture is the best route, no one can tell me otherwise."
5679,Good Crack
5680,10/10 vpog
5681,"Very good game, I got this about 6 years ago and only play it sometimes but when I do, I have a blast. After 115 hours I'm ready to give Civ VI a go, which I haven't tried yet. I'm always satisfied after a match and end up ""shelving"" it for a few months. Always just as fun when you start a new game. The games are long, and even a quick match will be about 300 turns, that will take hours and probably multiple sessions. 

On my phone I've played Civ VI which is a dumbed down version, but the new ideas are still there. I've watched lots of videos of the game as well. It appears that if you want a more simple game, even though it's almost 12 years old. Civ V is still a good purchase, even though there's a new version out."
5682,I really think it is the best game they made
5683,Cum!
5684,+
5685,I love this game and the community surrounding it
5686,"The pace of Civ V is quite moderate, won't be too slow like the Civ VI or too fast like the Civ III. The gameplay is fun too."
5687,Civ V is best Civ
5688,Great series!
5689,good
5690,awsome game
5691,its great and iv had it for over 5 years
5692,it's pretty neat
5693,fun strategy game can go slow or fast depending on the settings
5694,"Great Game, Always play with expansions but still fun even just base game. I have Civ 5 and 6 and play both pretty often."
5695,This game crashes a lot on my M1 Mac not recomended to users of Apple Silicon
5696,This and the 4th of the series are the best iterations of 4X genre.
5697,really fun
5698,"Tons of graphical problems: graphic glitches, resolution problems, texture loading slowly etc etc

Gameplay wise is a shittier version of CIV VI and a terrible betrayal to civ IV, probably the worst civ I don't know why people loved this title"
5699,Very good game would recommend
5700,Yes
5701,"good game
"
5702,"I have put in enough hours in the game to point out the good and the bad. This game is the template on which other turn based games are being made, let us be honest about that. There are tons of material which provides all that is glorious about this game. 

I will point out one thing which I really dislike about the game. As the difficulty is increased, the game AI almost is ridiculous. I don't despair one or two Civs being ahead of me, but right after a war, they seem to spawn units out of thin air. Doesn't matter if they don't have the money or resources, it just never ends. This alone makes the game as sad as AoE series where it is all about illogical and unending wars. I had hoped the game to be as smart as say Crusader Kings or Victoria (any Paradox's Strategy game) but sad to say it isn't."
5703,"The entire Steam platform is a joke. Your computer must maintain this ""Live connection to Steam"" at all times. Otherwise the software doesn't work. I think whomever designed this format didn't think this through. It's like trying to play with someone watching over your shoulder. Civ 4 was much better."
5704,"As with all of the more recent iterations of Civ, the happiness mechanic is extremely flawed and unrealistic.  With the expansions, more flaws are introduced, including a religion victory that makes little sense and adds no value to the playing experience.  Worse, the flaws of the expansions are brought into the base game in Civ VI.  Further, multiplayer games are just too long for most people (you will need an entire day).

That said, overall, Civ V is a decent entry in the series and the controls aren't too bad.  The Civ series definitely needs a streamlining and overhaul, though.  Take what's best and most enjoyable about it (expansion, exploration, tech trees, diplomacy) and pare down the rest.  Get rid of the less interesting victory conditions (cultural victory?  really???).  Then focus on getting the game length down to 2-3 hours.  This series desperately needs design help, but the framework for the series is fantastic and the graphics and controls finally come up to speed in this latest entry."
5705,its unreal
5706,I love this game.
5707,I like looks good and how good the animations are. But the some parts are hard to understand like the rocket.
5708,"Learn it, Love it!"
5709,Love the game
5710,better than civ 6
5711,why can people ban nukes bro like do they expect me to stop nuking people just because politics said so
5712,ok
5713,"> random civ wages war on me despite not even discovering each other
> nothing happens for 30 turns
> negotiate peace
> becomes afraid of me for some reason
> ask for least valuable city because why not
> ""This is not even close to a fair deal.""
> what will make this deal work
> gets most valuable city instead

10/10 game with amazing ai"
5714,gut
5715,A fantastic title for anybody who enjoys civ building and defeating foes. This game has some fun busted mechanics if you enjoy that too.
5716,Good game
5717,I've played Civilization games since 1991 and Civilization 5 is the greatest of all Civilization game series. Even 6 is below this one!
5718,"you can spend a lot of time playing, in the good way"
5719,The game is very addictive and it takes a little skill but it is worth ever cent. I wish my  internet was better as the multi player is fantastic.
5720,civ 6 is too cartoony and has worse selection of playable civs
5721,Who needs civ 6?
5722,"Good game, addictive"
5723,its alright
5724,cum
5725,"It's a matter of preference whether this one or Civ 4 are the best in the franchise, but either way you're getting one of the best 4x games ever made."
5726,Just one more turn before bed...
5727,awesome
5728,dauert mega lang einfach
5729,Lots of replay value
5730,Fantastic gameplay offering unlimited replay. This strategy game is well thought out and is good of entry level players and Civilization veterans alike.
5731,Fun
5732,T/T
5733,The Best Civ game of the lot. Civ 6 is a dumpster fire
5734,build city good
5735,"One of the best games I've ever played. Just wished that other bot civs with nothing going for them would stop having military forces that couldn't even be housed on planet earth, let alone their tiny plot of land left over there who knows where. I'm lookin' at you, Montezuma. You lost, it's okay. Just assimilate. I'm a good leader, I promise."
5736,sdfs
5737,You can nuke France as the Aztecs

5742,"played it for 4000 hours, simple and fun. To me better than civ 6"
5743,The best game ever made.
5744,"Played like two games, yeah its pretty alright."
5745,"Much better than Civ 6, this game is the peak of the RTX genre. With amazing graphics and animation, near infinite replay factor, this game delivers in an in depth, ever increasingly diverse array of decisions. Couple this with a very active and good community, this is in contention of being my favorite game."
5746,Cocaine
5747,Still an absolute blast in 2021!
5748,"Great turn based grand strategy, definitively worth but only with all the dlc"

THIS GAME IS SO RIDICLIOUSLY BADLY MADE, YOU SHOULD DELETE IT FROM THE GAME STORE.
GO IN YOUR GUN CABINET, AND SWALLOW THE COLD BARREL OF A SHOTGUN AND BLOW YOUR FUCKING FACE OFF

SHIT GAME FUCK YOU I WANT A REFUND"
5767,good game not hard to learn.
5768,"To be honest, this is one of my most loved, and most played games. More so than anything on console or otherwise. I love it!"
5769,I'm addicted.
5770,good. great. fantastic.
5771,"Over the years with multiple computers, and with trying to win the game with all the civilizations to use the Germans can always win the game faster than other civilizations. But your adversaries see you not as a race of warriors but as bloodthirsty monsters. Unfortunately it is very difficult to win the game by conquest. several times though I was the only civilization left, the game continued."
5772,"Too bad Sid Meier is a lazy moron who won't fix how dogshit the multiplayer support has become. Their best game left on a shelf to collect dust. Singleplayer is still fantastic though, and Civ V still looks much better than VI in my opinion."
5773,It's okay
5774,"Amazing game, honestly my favorite in the series and I have played em all since the original."
5775,love it
5776,Pretty dope. never fails to stress me out and cause me to go into a rage
5777,"I have played this since it was originally released and still enjoy all the variations that can be played. My only complaint would be that some historic civilizations are missing
"
5778,"ITS GOOD: multiple ways to win or lose, with differences between civs making each game new and interesting"
5779,Great game with great replay value
5780,"Civilization 5 is the Civilization formula that you know and love and that is both a good and a bad thing.

It's good in that you know what you're getting and that it's well put together and reasonably fun.
The bad is that it gets very repetitive and predictable. Games are decided by where you spawn and what strategic resources you have, the rest of the game is just a formality in many ways.

So then how do you keep the experience interesting and rewarding? How do you manage to put hundreds of hours into a supposedly repetitive game? The answer is mods.
There are some really good mods, but who makes those mods? You do of course! 
And unfortunately the modding tool in question is pure suffering.

Seldom have I seen such an un-intuitive train wreck of a modding tool. As if XML wasn't bad enough, the Civ5 SDK is somehow even worse. Making a mod in Civ5 is much harder than it has to be and the modding tool offers next to no feedback as to whether or not your work will actually function. In practice you have to run the game and pray, get an error message with absolutely no constructive information, and then sit and wonder how you could have messed up. Rinse and repeat until you go insane.

This is the vicious loop of Civ5 modding, absolute misery.

And since your enjoyment of this game is directly dependent on mods, I simply cannot recommend this game to anyone unless serious efforts are made to make modding less of a pain."
5781,"nice game
"
5782,Great game. Not too difficult to play
5783,duh!!!
5784,hey it's the best Civ game what can I say

5789,game good. start near friend. kill friend. take capital. friendship over.
5790,"it gud

"
5791,"My hours on this game may not look much, but that's because most of them were offline when I was younger, hundreds in total. My addiction to this franchise technically started with III, ramped up at IV, and came to fruition in V. As far as Sid Meier goes, I think this might be as good as it gets. Adding Hexagonal strategy was a much needed change, sufficient advances in graphics compared to previous generation, without becoming a cartoon-y mess (looking at you Civ VI). Advanced tech trees, including the addition of better units, helps it really feel like a different game than IV. Not sure what exactly about VI doesn't work, but without Civ V, I don't find myself wanting to wait just... one... more.... turn....."
5792,"Just an amazing game in general. Sunk so many hours into it, and intend to do so for many more. I'll admit it's gotten me addicted, but in the best way. Proper Vic fan because of this game, despite having joined on CIV3, missed CIV4, then on to this. If folks are into turn-based strategy then , in my opinion, there's not a finer choice out there."
5793,"This is one of the few games I can play for a reeeeaaaaally long time. It's definitely worth a try, everybody."
5794,"So.. I've been playing CIV since the first version (1991) and even though I found food management problematic in the DOS version it became easier over the years. In CIV V it was the best in my experience. CIV 6 is again more complex and time consuming in a way not to my personal liking. 

CIV 5 has the ""just one more turn"" feeling, where you realize an hour later that you were supposed to only to that one extra turn.. Sure.. the AI is somewhat stupid and people leave all the time during an online game due to no rating / reputation system but that happens in every game.. 

All with all; still worth buying and playing right now."
5795,"Симулятор сидения за компьютером, пока играл одну партию успел сломать позвоночник, вырастить геморрой, сердечную недостаточность, пережил всех своих родственников и смену власти."
5796,I've played this game. I've liked it.
5797,"Yeah id rape

5798,It can be a totally different experience in every game. So many options. Victory is never a given.
5799,I JUST NEED ONE MORE TURN!

5802,Haven’t even owned the game a full day yet and already have 7 hours played.

5827,Awesome game
5828,It is just fun to play. I really love this turn based game.
5829,"Civ 5, like its predecessors, is an excellent strategy game and still enjoyable to play years later."
5830,great game must play with gf or bf (getting one beforehand is recommended)
5831,"Great Game, Classic Civilization engine."
5832,"It's probably a crime somewhere that I haven't reviewed Civ V yet, and it's been years since I've even played it, but hey, better late than never.

Civilization has a 30 year history at this point. It's THE 4x game, being largely responsible for creating that sub-genre of turn-based strategy games, and even popularizing turn-based strategy games to begin with. There's a lot we could dive into looking at those things, but I'm more interested in this particular installment, the fifth entry, V.

For me, V is the best in the series. Its systems are slightly more complex than IV, while being slightly simpler than VI. That makes it just complicated enough to remain interesting for an entire playthrough, while still being able to wrap your head around everything. I also feel that in some of the earlier games it was maybe too easy to achieve the state of ""this victory is inevitable but I wait 50 more turns to see it through."" There is some of that in V, to be sure, but it's not as bad as it could be.

V also has a wealth of content not related to the normal mode - there are rigged scenarios, replaying historical conflicts, and a ton of little things to discover. This game is a complete package.

My biggest complaint is technical: this game will peg your CPU at 100% for minutes at a time during games with a large number of AIs. It got so bad that my computer would regularly do an emergency shut off to avoid overheating. Literally no other app had ever caused that to happen, before or since. And it was doing this all on one core even though 8 were available. I eventually installed a new heat sync in order to get through those games, so I can only imagine what other players went through trying to troubleshoot this behavior.

The multiplayer interface and save/load mechanism could also use some work. Getting through long games with friends - even when dedicated to the process - was way more of a headache than it needed to be.

Civ V is the best of the best when it comes to building your own civilization. It's fun and deep, and will keep you coming back to play as new characters or try out new strategies. You'll inevitably lose some sleep due to playing well into the night.

Just. One. More. Turn..."
5833,"good game
"
5834,"Aside from the fact that playing multiplayer with mods installed, this game has almost no flaws to me - with the DLCs included, the vanilla version is incomplete and unbalanced on vartious fields as the economical and military aspect. 
The hours this game can provide to a player are too many - to some I could actually consider this product addicting.
To give this game the proper credit this review would be too long to summerize so:
- resonably balanced turns system; 
- movement system superior even to the 6th installment (as of the day of the review);
- fantastic map generation that almost always allows for a different experince every new game;
- proper AI difficulty - at least up to the 6th, as in my opinion the 7th and 8th are really too challenging;
- different civilizations with unique units, structures and bonuses that allows for different strategies;
- many other gameplay elements such as city-states, religion (1st DLC), great artists and many more;
- historic scenarios (the American Civil War, the Fall of the Western Roman Empire, the colonization of the Americas just to name a few) with special events that impact the game;
- rich modding system.
However, this game comes with few flaws and much room for improvements. Just to name a few:
- the need for a 'casus belli' (the motive for declaring war on some other civilization) which has been implemented in the 6th installment;
- the balancing for the IA difficulty at the higher levels;
- a shared system for multiplayer modding;
- the need for different units, structures, wonders and civ bonuses.
Other than this, I would give this game a 8.5/10, (almost) totally recommended for every turn based strategic player who wants a clean hud, less cartoony graphics and (as for the day of the review) a better alternative for Civilization 6.

5835,Nothing quite like exterminating entire civilizations with nuclear weapons.
5836,.

5934,Relaxing game with smart gameplay
5935,"Years ago, I used go play a lot of Civilization IV. Civilization V is considerably simpler in terms of city management, and the possibilities for satisfying, non-violent victories have been greatly enhanced. I like to play easy modes so that the game serves as a fun meditation. Be careful, the game is addictive."
5936,"I like it because there are fewer variables than civ V! and that makes for a swifter game. However, I would really like to play the game using voice only for all commands and movements instead of a mouse or keyboard. When would this feature be available?"
5937,I prefer this version of the game it is less complicated and easier game play and the graphics are really good on this old computer. Enjoy the game.
5938,Great game w friends
5939,a classic

5951,meow
5952,Epic
5953,Amazing game with near infinite replayability. Mods make it even better. Its very addicting
5954,A step up from the earlier Civilization games and initially can seem difficult to grasp the change in style and strategy. Keep at it though and it becomes compelling. Recommend it as long as you are willing to lose hours in engrossing play.
5955,I dont play it much but its ight
5956,An excellent and addicting game series.  Great for player who like to play games with strategy and an eye towards the long view.

5996,It is amazingly fun.
5997,Great game
5998, great game enjoy playing it
5999,Great strategy game!
6000,This game is a lot of fun when you just want something to putter around with. I'm not a person who mods a game very easily. Usually have to have one of my kids walk me through the process. But with this game you really don't need to mod it to customize your game for your own specific play style. Don't like random battling just for the sake of fighting something? Take out the barbarians and Domination victory. Like a short game? Start closer to the ending era. Want a hard game that'll make your brain hurt? Up your starting status. I also like that there are female leaders I can choose to play as and those females aren't wimps. They're actually very stronger women from history who served their countries well during their time period.
6001,Great game with some flaws but lots to offer.
6002,Fantastic game that you can get lost in for days. Smooth gameplay and customization that allows for endless replay value.
6003,Best 4X strategy game.
6004,Decent but showing its age technical wise.
6005,soup
6006,"Very good, better then Civ 6 base game."
6007,"If you are looking for a great time wasting game, this is it."
6008, ww game
6009,god gam
6010,great for those with patience
6011,"Civ 5 is a solid game with good core values. It adds faith and religion in a way that allow you to win/change the game vs the previous entries, and I happen to like the way the civic tree's work. That being said, civ 6 has a better way to work with civics I think, and lets you customize cities more.  One big plus for this is that it works better online then 6."
6012,good game.  Better than 6
6013,"One of the best turn based strategies ever, hands down."
6014,Fantastic game. Downright amazing. Made many good memories playing it.
6015,"I think that you should get this game if you just want a TLDR. My experience will differ from yours a bit because I have all the DLC, you might not though.

I think this is one of the only RTS games that I've ever played and actually thought it was fun without having to have friends, It's great for single player. The multiplayer is also extremely fun but if you play a full game, it could take up to 2 to 3 times longer then a single player play through might take, just because people might take a while to pass on their turn. If you have active players, its a hell of a lot of fun."
6016,cum
6017,Best Civ!
6018,It's Age of Empires
6019,"Great game with lots of different ways to play - It is a strategy game, but without the extreme complicated setup as other games - its a great balance between being difficult and being easy to understand. 
9/10 - Higher difficulties are just a game of luck when it comes to if they declare war on you in the early game"
6020,.
6021,The best one yet. Far better than Civ 6
6022,hehe funny india
6023,i love genocide.
6024,"I like the game Short and simple the game was fun ten years ago and its fun now. The graphics have held up wonderfully and the mechanics of the game work, while i don't appreciate some of the mechanics THEY WORK as they should."
6025,i havent really played this game much but it seems ok.
6026,"its pree gud
"
6027,"Good game, love it"
6028,"Victory is Mine
"
6029,"This, like the rest of the franchise, is a great turn based strategy game.  I have to say I like the quotes that go with the different technologies better in IV, but the various civilizations and leaders are all great."
6030,"With more than 100,000 positive reviews; there's nothing else more that could be said about this game."
6031,PandaCivilizationPants
6032,Excellent. Civ 5 is great and you don't have to endure the huge stacks of enemy units of the previous versions of this game.  The Civics and Religion make it even more engaging and fun.
6033,"Like every Civ I've played since the first in the early 90s, this one is addictive and fun."
6034,Very balanced game  at the entry level. somewhat more challenging ant the higher levels. My all time favorite game.
6035,oops I nuked the Turks and the native americans haha
6036,timeless classic no more to say
6037,i like all!
6038,first civ game that i actually played and loved it
6039,far better than 6!
6040,One of the best games ever made.. Prove me wrong
6041,it always start with a single click and never ending next turn. one of the best civ version in the entire series.
6042,1200 hours and counting
6043,Fewer bad bugs than Civ 6. I like the UN idea.
6044,good game 10/10
6045,The game is awesome. This is the most played game on my Steam acc.
6046,addicting cause every playthrough is different
6047,"Just finished a single game , that took me 108 hrs of gameplay. Small world, Worlord, conquered them all. And what do I have to say ? Civ5 is a good looking game, easy, interesting. You cannot stack same kind of infantry , that means you don't need them a lot.  So you focus on grow, and slowely dominate them all. Finished by 1858 , and had a Great War Infantry (1WW I think), machine guns, Great War Bomber, Submarines and railways built everywere. Top resource at this stage was Aluminium and Oil. 
Having built tens of Wanders, maybe 30 , I think this level was too weak overall , so I am glad to have this already finished.  Was a good one , but time to check out the Civ 6."
6048,Great fun with family
6049,I've just realised I've played this for 900 hours.  I think that says enough.
6050,"Great game, extremely addictive."

6057,"My favorite game in the world. Recommended to all people that like politics, war, strategy, and tactical thinking."
6058,goof
6059,"With a still highly active modding community, Civ 5 still reviles both Civ 6 and Humankind in this sub-genre of strategy games."
6060,"one eye open when im sleeping, one eye"
6061,Awsome
6062,noice
6063,"I used to love this game, but its '2560x1440' screen display settings force you to play in a minimized box, while playing '1920x1080' looks like a$$"
6064,"i love this game. if you are really into alternate history turn based strategy politics and stuff, then this is the game for you!"
6065,"Very much nostalgic and loads of fun.
Works great on the M1 MacBook."
6066,"a super game civilization simulator a great buy, definitely worth 30 bucks.
"
6067,BEST  CIV. GAME EVER

6069,"this game is perfect. got the money? please, buy it!"
6070,yes
6071,"I've played this game for hundreds of hours and I still suck at it.

8/10"
6072,Like Colorful chess with a lot of customization with mods
6073,Taking over the world with friends.... what's not to like???? The evolution of civilizations from the stone age through modern times is very fun to watch progress. It is also a blast trying to take out your enemies after amassing a huge military... especially when your allies are nearby! :)
6074,good and cool!1!
6075,the best turn based strategy game out there
6076,One of if not the best TBS game I have ever played. I have owned it for years and have had many great games against friends and the AI. 100% recommend; even now many years after its release.
6077,Most addicting game ever! Great replay value.
6078,ALMOST BEST GAME EVER

6086,Literally best game ever.
6087,good
6088,easily one of the best games of all time.  I hadn't played this game in a few years and I just picked it up again and it's still as fun as I expected it to be
6089,It's crack...you know it is. Just give in to it.
6090,"ITS A GOOD GAME BUY IT NOW!
ITS SO FUN"
6091,Game good.
6092,"amazing, fun game to kill hours and hours of free time"
6093,if you enjoy long term games that require planning and stategy this game is for you
6094,fun
6095,very goodly yes
6096,"The Arabian Civilizations:
- Arabian
- Assyrian
- Babylonian
- Carthaginian
- Egyptian
- Moroccan

The west are so ignorant when they write about Arabs history and they fake information as much as they can!
Anyway back to the game, I don't like this: Harun Al Rashid wearing earrings! which is not historical at all!
Also huge Arabian Empires like: Rashidun/Umayyad/Abbasid deserve a very high science level (more than Hamurabi)+ military power which is historical as you know but you don't see any of that in this game or any other strategy game, Not fair as always when it comes to Arabs. The west should fix their ego.

"
6097,LIKE IT MORE THAN 6 AS CAN JUST SIT FOR A BIT AND PLAY WITHOUT BEING SO ENVELOPED BY THE OTHER ASPECTS OF THE GAME
6098,Was fun
6099,It okay
6100,I love this game's progressive system compared to any other game.
6101,fantastic game!  i have played this countless times.  very high replay value.  probably best civ game.  only critique is trying to maintain happiness in conquered cities is tougher than it should be
6102,"This is a very fun game, it's turn based, and allows you to build up civilizations. Also kinda addicting. This and Spore are the two games that I have the most trouble stopping."
6103,Best Civ game ever made.
6104,really fuckin fun
6105,So fun!
6106,"I am addicted to nicotine, and that is less addicted than this game. I bought it like 3 days ago and already have 30+ hours. Do not buy this if you have a job, be prepared to play this for 4+ hours straight on your first game."
6107,"Good strategy game. Probably the best in Civ collection.
Easy to learn but hard to play very well.
Being able to play against a mix of humans and computer is a definite plus.
Recommended."
6108,Good and relaxing game
6109,better than civ 6
6110,"Love the strategic aspect of this game! I grew up playing Civ III, and the updates in V just make it even better!"
6111,Fun
6112,"best version of Civilization
"
6113,Its a perfect game to have in the background while studying or doing something else
6114,just one more turn then im done for good
6115,最好玩的文明
6116,it's good
6117,Fun single player and even better with friends. DLCs make the game a lot better too.
6118,very good much play
6119,next turn
6120,"I get to rule the world.
"
6121,"To quote my friend Politeboat: I have played this game a lot. It has gotten me into this genre, and it continues to be so good that I come back, even over the sequel.
5/5 stars. One of my favorite games, my favorite strategy game of all time."
6122,"Great game, so replayable. As soon as you have it down, just play as someone else on a new map, with a new goal. My second most played game ever I think."
6123,Play it dummy
6124,ty
6125,"Man Oh Man this is fun - but it's also one of those time sucker that before you notice takes up your entire day. It doesn't help that a single game usually lasts a few hours.
Anyhow, if you're into strategy games, give this a shot."
6126,"I like game. Me play game. Me win game. XD
Best Civ game ever."
6127,Cheguei sem expectativa e ma viciei
6128,very gd
6129,WAR
6130,I would recommend this game to others who like strategy. This game is very enjoyable as it gives endless ways on how to win and the open world type is very fun as well. The strategy as well is very nice with it being a complex game with much detail and depth. This game however isn't a short one to play often taking many hours to complete a game if not days so if you like playing a short game this isnt ideal for you. All and all good game worth the price.
6131,Always fun to play
6132,love this game
6133,Still fun despite the colonization propaganda that the game basically is.
6134,Its no Civ4 thats for sure
6135,"just an amazing game, thanks :)"
6136,"Once you get used to the controls and gameplay, it's hard to stop playing"
6137,"It's Civ V. Don't even trip.

Definitely hydrate and remember to sleep."
6138,"great time consumer and entertaining
"
6139,its good
6140,"Locked out of my other steam account, 332 hours is just the beginning. Play in class, play in the background of football games, play forever, and you'll never be done. Civilization eats life like women"
6141,"Excelent game! Mixing many types of strategy, it's that game you can spend hours and hours on."
6142,q
6143,This is an awesome strategy game. I love the option to customize the game because I love the marathon mode and you can select everything you want to make the game more enjoyable for you.
6144,I've dropped so many nukes I think the atmosphere would have been destroyed.
6145,Has Pros and Cons compared to Civ VI They're both pretty good games. I would recommend them both. I'm glad I know the civ series and really enjoy playing it especially with friends.
6146,Great strategy gaming opportunities abound.  Massively re-playable and challenging.
6147,"sadly I cannot reccomend this flawed game, it's just snowball simulator
it can be fun for a little while; but ultimately sinking your teeth into it is unrewarding, and the more you learn about how the game works the more you lose hope in it being good.

there are better strategy games out there to spend your time learning. but atleast this is much better than civ 6"
6148,Addictive more than crystal meth :O
6149,"no comments needed, you already know this game is good"
6150,"I have never played it before, pretty gay!"
6151,Next turn...
6152,Not much of a fan of CIV 6 but love CIV 5 and will randomly come back to play a game. Would always recommend great game for anyone.
6153,"compare with  civilization vi ,the V is deep in culture part . you can appreciate it slowly."
6154,Not as good as civ IV but better than civ VI. Great game that helped me seem smart in history class nonetheless.
6155,"ok
"
6156,A great game that has aged well over the years and easily surpasses its successor.
6157,"[Story] : N/A
[Gameplay] : 9/10
[Sountrack/Music] : 8/10
[Audio Design] : 7/10
[Visuals/Graphics] : 7/10
[Difficulty] : 7/10
[Overall] : 9/10

A must play if you enjoy long-lasting strategy-based games. You will definitely lose track of time as you build, grow, defend, and expand your civilization. Highly recommended the DLCs and definitely recommend playing with a group of friends."
6158,Worm Town Ethiopia
6159,civ 5 is life
6160,Based
6161,This is the masterpiece of strategy turned based absolutely worth every penny don't even think twice about getting it you will get invested in this game like no tomorrow it is extremely addicting and most importantly it has replay value so you will probably have at least one thousand hours while playing this game worth it !
6162,"Goo so far, might need to play some more."
6163,uuuuhhhhh it was good
6164,"Played for a bit, it's alright."
6165,Better than Civ VI
6166,"Absolutely amazing game, really goes to show just how diverse our history is."
6167,"If someone asked for a help, happy to help
If someone asked for an alliance, happy to be.

But,
If someone asked for a war, so be it."
6168,This is a great game
6169,"It's a classic

6177,purty gud gayme
6178,If you know you know
6179,is good
6180,One of the best turn-based games out there! Tons of choices for who you want to be and a bunch of different paths to take to victory! Will always recommend this game.
6181,Terrific when played with friends in multiplayer
6182,CIV V jest super sama w sobie :)
6183,With out question this best game I have ever played! I play a lot of games that I love a lot but Civilization 5 is the best strategy game ever!!!
6184,"Just tried it this morning. You're fired. Cheating game. Try Deep Blue from microsoft came out in 1996 and 
work on 120Mhz CPU. That what they call strategy."
6185,"i really liked civ for a long time.  but then civ IV needlessly simplified things, and that was the direction the series decided to go.  this one is the worst of all of them, even VI makes improvements.  play alpha centauri if you want civ gameplay, play eu4 if you want history simulator"
6186,cool

6188,nice game
6189,My Brain Hurts Trying to Play This Game
6190,Abandoned CIV 6 and Humankind to return to this masterpiece.
6191,"Although some would disagree, once you download the DLC and some mods, this is the most beautiful, most elegant of all the civ games. I love playing this for relaxation, listening to the traditional regional music or podcasts on the history of the civ I am playing. I love Civilization V."
6192,it doesn't disappoint
6193,Love this game; much better than VI
6194,good game
6195,Yeah it's alright.
6196,i can go for hours at a time. great brain sucker
6197,"It's like Civ 6, but good"
6198,"One of the best strategy games out there, easy to play but hard to master, either way the first 50 hours of playing go by so quick that your really don't notice you're getting better. The only problem is finding a good balance in difficulty, but when you find it, it is so fun and time consuming that you'll forget you even have family."
6199,Very versatile game!
6200,Good game to start on if you want to learn how to play civ. Honestly a fun game all around thats worth sinking time into. few downsides. get a friend who knows how to play
6201,Great game will keep you happy for hours
6202,This is a fun game of building an empire and Civilization.
6203,1400 hours of game time and still love it.
6204,It's okay I guess
6205,yep
6206,fffff
6207,No support for wide monitors which is idiotic as this type of game was more or less MADE for having extra screen space.
6208,"@Graundenisia on instagram recommended me this game! had tons of fun, cant thank the guy enough. He must really be into strategy turn based games! show him some love!"
6209,"Rush nukes, win the game"

6290,"I've played more than 450 hours at this game, and i can say that this is my favourite game in the whole franchise.
This is the game of my childhood... I still remember when i saw for the first time my dad playing civ IV; i fell in love with this game and the whole franchise, i've played from civ 4 till 6, and i'll never regret all those hours that i played...
THANKS for being the game of my childhood"
6291,Amazing!
6292,"Where to begin... Hmm... I would say that Civ 5 is the ultimate game to play when you don't have anything else to play. Got tired of mining in MC? Civ 5. The raid in WoW was exhausting? Civ 5. You're in a losing streak in LoL? Civ 5.

Or if you want to just get totally addicted to telling people what to do. This game is for you! You wanna feed that God-Complex of yours? Go for it! For real, it's so easy to just start playing and think: ""I'm just gonna do a couple of rounds!"" and then POOF it's 6 hours later.

The resource management in this game is phenomenal and the animation style is on point. It's a bit dated but it's charming af.
The only bad thing I personally have to say about the game is that it's a bit hard to get in to when you first start playing. Not everything is very obvious and it takes a while to get used to some of the game mechanics. But once you understand it a bit more it gets WAAAY easier to play.

Oh and the help section in the game is bullshit IMO. If you need something explained a bit quicker just google it or go on to youtube and search for it. Because by the time you finish reading those god-awful help pages, you don't really have the energy to keep playing. It totally ruins your flow. 

My rating of this game? A solid 7.5/10
Graphics 6/10
Sound 8/10
Gameplay 8/10
Animation style (and yes this gets it's own rating) 9/10                     (I might be a little biased, don't @ me)"

6298,Awesome game although I almost always am playing on Switch for handheld it's definitely better on pc.
6299,I just keep coming back to this game. It's stable (which is more than you can say of Civ VI) and provides for enjoyable game play time after time.

6314,My favorite game of all time
6315,Good
6316,This game is amazing. It baffles me how quickly you can lose track of time playing.
6317,Probably the best CIV game I've ever played. The while feel of this game was perfect. Easy to learn coming from Civ IV. Fun to play and a good way to spend time. Achievements were also a good incentive to play how I wouldn't normally.
6318,One more turn...
6319,.
6320,"Great replay value.  There's a reason people say, ""Just one more turn""."
6321,Civilization 4 was the last of the playable games. Everything has glitches. Every map every mod. Its insanely frustrating to customize anything. Spent hours building maps that don't turn on. Other map will just randomly shutoff at 1000 years over and over lol. This is insanely stupid game.
6322,"Such a great game, still playing it (2021). I can't think of any reason to buy another civilization game. It feels very complete."
6323,"I'm late to the party, but yes, this game is still awesome."
6324,one of the best gmaes ever made will never be topped at what it does
6325,"This is an amazing and addictive game. The best TBS game I've ever played and the map is completely random each time, so it never gets stale as you explore the world. Easily a 10/10 game."

6345,One of the best games I have ever played. I have over 1200 hours and I can't stop. It's 1000% worth very cent. The different civilizations and unique units make sure any 1 game play isn't the same. Lots of options to pick as well. One of my all time favorite games.

6363,Great replayability!
6364,It is really fun ok bye
6365,"Just an all around fun game with depth and replayability. Even now in 2021 I and many others are still playing Civ V, which is a testament to all involved in the games making.  Something about Civ V hit that sweet spot for me, taking all the elements that hooked me in civ IV (my first installment as a child in grade school, having before played age of empires a bit) and then adding what to me was a fantastic immersive combat experience with the hexagonal board and single stacked combat units.  The game is a joy and an inspiration."
6366,its ok
6367,Excellent game. There are very few games I have sunk this much time into. Superior to Civ VI.

6422,good game
6423,"If you've played Civilization games in the past, you probably already have a pretty good idea if you'd like this. If you haven't, I view it primarily as an empire building game from a higher level. You don't control battles on a small scale but direct most of the rest of the empire. I feel like the end game is a bit less enjoyable but I do love that early and mid-game expansion period where it feels like there's a lot going on in multiple parts of the game. End game feels like it slows down and feels more of a trudge so I tend to reach a point where I just start a new game and I enjoy that early/mid part of the game."

6445,"Honestly, this game stands the test of time. I liked Civ 4 but when this came out, eliminated unit stacking and went to hex-grid, I know folks were uneasy about it. I enjoy the change of tiles, the change on how exploitation of resources occurs, and that overall the game is more competitive between AI and player, or players because there are valid alternate options rather than just ""explode military, kill all""."
6446,"Honestly I love Civilization games!! I absolutely love this game and the strategy. It does take awhile, I play on standard so you could shorten a game obviously! But it can take awhile to play which for me I love! I'd say it can look overwhelming but it's actually not that bad and fairly ""simple"" as you learn the game and what everything means. I also love the advisers they give you to help explain everything as you go even higher up in age. I personally highly recommend this game!"
6447,Great game. So many things to discover and master. Different leaders have unique units and buildings and there are also several win conditions.
6448,Russia #1!!
6449,This game is always a fun time when traveling or have spare time away from your desktop.
6450,This game goes big.
6451,"Do you remember when this game came out and it had hexagons instead of squares? I do and that shit was crazy. It was like, ""what next, hexagon doors?"". Okay, I'll shut up now.

This is the greatest boardless board game ever made. It really has no right being a video game and that's the beauty of it. You can learn this game in an afternoon and everyone plays on an uneven playing field (unlike history or real strategy). If you want more satisfaction, play EU4 (or any Paradox game) if you want more depth (employing strategy rather than dice rolls in battle) play a Total War game but if you want to play with friends, you play this. Do yourselves the favour of downloading the multiplayer balance mods, thank me later. You're welcome in advance.

Buy it, get the DLC and find some friends you loser.

If anyone wants to play, let me know - looking for people to play with."

6489,"Significantly better than Civ VI (which I own). I just completed another play last month. This game is so well known, there seems little point writing an in-depth review. If you like building an empire in a turn-based strategy game, you will like Civ V. An absolute steal on a sale (if they still run them).

I have no negative comments. Religion is not a win condition (as it should be; when religion is involved, nobody wins)."

If you're into turn-based strategic games, this is already something you'll thoroughly enjoy. Every single aspect if Civilisation V is so well thought out, perhaps with the exception of one or two minor details. I'm sure you'll be somewhat familiar with the Civilisation game series, or at the very least this style of game. Pick a civilisation to play as, each has its own perks and drawbacks, evolve your civilisation through each era, such as the Classical era or the Renaissance. You have full control over what play-style suits you best, you can opt for a small map with less opponent civilisations and a more relaxed difficulty, or larger map with more opposing civilisations, each set to a high difficulty to make your experience more challenging. You can choose from a whole range of environments to play in, such as Pangaea, Archipelago, islands, Continents, you name it, it's there.

What I love the most about Civilisation V is that it doesn't matter how many times you play it, there is always a different way to play it, the inclusion of multiple victories that you can have makes this extremely fun. For example, you can aim for a Scientific Victory, where you have to be the first to research and conduct the Apollo Program. There are other victories too such as a Religious Victory, whereby you spread your own founded religion to the rest of the world. There's a Diplomatic Victory, where in the world congress you get elected world leader to win the game.. the point is, there are many ways to play the game, and depending on how you want to succeed, you would go about your play-style differently.

The attention to detail is incredible, for a game that is over 11 years old by this point, it feels incredibly up to par with the sort of detail that goes into newer games. The music for instance sets the mood, depending on the civilisation you pick, it'll be tailored more towards the style of music of that culture and region. It's not invasive in any way, and heavily assists in making your play-through more immersive. 

You have so much freedom over each play-through, if you know what you're doing, then you'll be left to do your thing, however, if you're less experienced you can opt to take note of what your advisers are, well.. advising. You'll have an adviser for each domain, such as science, foreign relations, military cultural, etc.. They might also propose decisions for you, and will offer guidance if you're a little stuck, which is always great for those starting out. I myself still loosely follow recommendations and guidance from advisers, even though I've been playing Civilisation V for over 5 years now, it's a really handy tool.

To quickly skim over this, you're able to of course trade with over Civilisations, make alliances with them, declare war on them, etc. City-states you'll find will be of great importance during your play-through, especially if you're aiming for a Diplomatic Victory. You can complete quests from each city-state to gain influence with them, which will eventually make them allied with you. This means that they will contribute to your war efforts if you decide to go down that route, or more commonly will supply you with a diplomat during the congress later on in the game. Each allied city-state will supply 1 diplomat, the more diplomats you have, the greater authority and power you have politically. Ultimately, having the most diplomats will essentially mean you can pass world-wide laws and bans, and well.. to eventually be elected world leader which will get you a Diplomatic Victory.

A side note, but still very cool, you can play through scenarios from real historical events, it's a wonderful experience! Also, the many achievements to unlock always give you something to do, they vary in difficulty and it's always so rewarding when you finally complete one of those achievements! 

If you've got the money to spare, I'd absolutely pick up Civilisation V, even at full price. It may seem a lot for a game of this age, however, each game will last anywhere from 4-10 hours, even just having one play through would make the game worthwhile buying. If you have a friend with Civilisation V, then you can play together, great, but if you don't, then it's arguably just as, if not more fun to play by yourself. My only query would be the AI, which only rarely makes questionable diplomatic decisions, other than that.. it's a really joy to play! 

And if you've read through this review.. you are a saint, thank you and I truly hope this has convinced you to buy this amazing work of art! <3"
6517,Great for friends looking to hang out and do something together
6518,"After 3k hours played, I still fall back on this game when I want to spend an afternoon/evening gaming with friends."

6532,"Civ 5 has been around forever and most people will already know what it is and what kind of game it is. But if you are reading this review, maybe you're on the fence and need actual useful information. I have at the writing of this review 1715 hours in Civ 5 on Steam. It is my most-played and probably favorite game of all time. 

I've been playing Sid Meier's Civ since 3 and I picked up 5 when I was in the military. My shipmates and I used to play and that's where i first honed my strategy. This is a game where you can easily sink 1000 hours fine-tuning how you want to play. It is the 4x that all other strategy games should be and generally are judged. I really didn't like Civ 6 as much, honestly Humankind was everything Civ 6 should have been, but even after decades I still come back to Civ 5.

My advice is play every Civ, learn all of their strategies. You will fall in love with each of them in turn. An England naval domination campaign is just as satisfying as an Arabian golden oasis economic masterpiece. Austria Inca and the Netherlands are set up for seriously gorgeous cities. I love the Netherlands with sprawling fields of colorful flowers and windmills. Try every victory too, the best probably being city state alliance world leader vote. EXCEPT TIME. Turn time off every time, it is the worst. 

Also raging barbarians is underrated af in my opinion, it really forces you to get a military early on and keeps the AI at bay from settling everything immediately. 

That's my opinion. If you love sweet games then get this bish on sale."

6572,Best of the Civilization series. Far better then the weak and uninteresting Civ. 6.

However

We still haven't used it for its intended use.. my missus needs to ""grow a pair""

6601,"Great game, buy the whole package for 13 bucks during a sale and then enjoy the best Civilization experience offered."
6602,"I've never been very big into strategy games, so it's a bit odd that this ended up as one of the first games I owned on Steam, and it's not surprising that I didn't really enjoy my first time with the game. Thankfully I have a friend who was quite into this game that convinced me to give this game another go, and I had a great time playing it with him.

This game is a very fun strategy game and it's not surprising that it's still quite popular. It's quite satisfying to build a civilization from the ground up and there's a large amount of flexibility and strategy in how you go about running your nation. The game looks nice as well and runs well, although my friends and I did run into occasional network-related issues which were a bit frustrating.

There are a couple of major flaws with this game that were the reasons why I didn't initially enjoy the game though:
[list]
[*] The game is horrible at teaching you how to play. The included tutorial is abysmal and is missing a ton of vital information on how certain things work (including basic things like citizen management). Even my friend who has played this game for hundreds of hours is still learning new things about how certain things work, and there are far too mechanics that are impossible to understand the intricacies of until you have a significant amount of playtime under your belt. Once I got more familiar with the game, this became less of an issue, but it was pretty detrimental when I was first learning the game.
[*] Having a large number of units is very time consuming and can be very tedious to manage. Large conflicts drastically slow down the game and it can be quite annoying to move huge armies across the land, given the many restrictions on where units can move or go.
[/list]

[b]TL;DR[/b] This is a fun strategy game that I've had a lot of fun playing with my friends. It has great gameplay, looks nice, and is fairly stable, although it is quite difficult to learn and can be tedious at times. Unless you're really into strategy games, I might not recommend this game if you're planning to play by yourself, but I would highly recommend this game if you have friends to play it with, as it's quite fun."

6608,"I have played Civ 5 for about 11 years now, having played all the games and versions since Civ 2, and still like it best of the systems One of the best features is the variety caused by different leaders, and then using different levels with them. I'm not great at it -- still have won only half a dozen at Level 7 -- but find it great at keeping my mind alert.  Now that I'm retired, I usually play maybe three hours each evening. 

I find the religion system is not worth much, although I might have found it more entertaining it different religions varied like different leaders do (although I recognize religion can be more ""hot"" than ancient leaders.

I still have a few questions for which I'd like answers.  Does a Worker count as a Garrison? A Great General? A War Ship? How does a unit ""work"" a Natural Wonder? Some Repairs take 2 turns while a few take 0 turns. Can I control that?  Six Natural Wonders usually arrive, but sometimes five -- why?  What is ""Flanking"" --  beside others or two sides of an enemy unit?"
6609,Great entry in the series.

It's scary that I've actually sunk over 1000 hours into this game over the years, but that's just testimony to how good it is...and the fact that I probably need to get out more. :)"

6622,"There is nothing I can add that hasn't already been said about this game. Classic strategy addiction, basically digital heroin. You could spend an entire day destroying other Civs with a friend and you wouldn't even notice that the clock went from 10am to 5pm."
6623,Its so good
6624,"sick and tired of game changing its numbered perimeters after agreeing to purchase of..,  for any or all cities!  Game constantly is always tipped against you.  It most certainly does not matter on games difficulty settings!"

Being a huge history buff it's always interesting to play out the what if scenarios. You can go peaceful or be a warmonger. I've finished the game with nukes in every city with giant mechanized robots destroying everything in this path. While some of them are still stuck in WW2 times. Very Fun with a capital F.

6677,Quite an exquisite game. Definitely would recommend.
6678,"Tactic capabilities of AI is just too weak. AI players overestimate their strength without exception - and seek confrontation when they ought to seek cooperation.

But those problems are much worse in Civ VI - making that game a complete waste of time. So currently Civ V is the really the only option..."

6686,if you love the first series of games this is just a bigger better expansion of what you already love about this franchise
6687,ok
6688," I never thought the day of review would come, but here we are.  

No, I will never get all of the achievements. 

You don't play civilization to win. 

You play to optimize. To play to optimize, you must play for the motherland. 

When playing as Russia, you must start in the tundra. The map must be a boundless frontier, the temperature must be cold, and the barbarians must be raging. 

You must build the pyramids for rapid expansion. 

The hardest choice to make is choosing between Messenger of the Gods and Dance of the Aurora - both are broken late game. 

But not as broken as the ""Matryoshka"" achievement."

6711,One of the best RTS games on Steam.
6712,"A combination of the best aspects of Civ IV and Civ VI, in my opinion the best civilization game. DLC is pretty good, not as good as IV's, and when it comes to combat vs cities, a bit more challenging than IV (which I think is better), but not a slog like city sieging is in V."
6713,meth
6714,"Civilization V is my favorite game of the series so far. When it was released many fans were criticizing the fact that it got rid off many old mechanics of the series, but I personally think this was an actual improvement. And mainly because of that I enjoyed this game a lot. The vanilla version is still, however, not that good because it has lack of religions and some other things, but together with both expansions it is a very good Civilization game. The combat system where only a single unit can be placed on a single hex is so much better than old messy way of how skirmishes were happening in Civilization. And the whole movement to hexes instead of squares was very good too. Not even mentioning improved graphics. I especially want to mention the overall graphic style here. It is bright but still somehow realistic. It's way a better than in Civilization VI, in my opinion! I even skipped Civilization VI all together because of the graphics. Yes, I know there is mod which makes graphics to look like in Civilization V, but it does not change how leaders are portrayed, obviously. So, I enjoyed Civilization V so much that I even couldn't accept that Civilization VI changed faction units for specific nations. For example, the removal of Panzer for Germany was heartbreaking to me. Well, I am not saying that Civ5 is superior than Civ6 in every aspect (for example, the adding of natural disasters and climate system there is one of the best things which happened to the series, in my opinion), but still I think it is a very solid part of the series. After playing 300 of hours I probably will never be back to it, because I play basically everything and just don't have time to spend it only on one game, however, I will be looking forward to the future of the series. Because ""Civ"" is just one hell of a game.  Where else you can choose a civilization and lead it across all the eras of mankind's history?.. And by the way, I almost forgot, check the track of Dan Bull about Civilization series on YouTube. It captures the series whole depth and atmosphere just perfect, while being some sort of ode not only to the series themselves but to the mankind in general."
6715,Classic strategy game. Much prefer Civ V to Civ VI.
6716,"Not a terrible game but you would think after 5 civilizations they would have figured out the diplomacy feature.  Been trash since Civ 1, no real options except kill everyone because they always hate you and attack"
6717,"It's unfortunately an absolute you get the DLCs - they fundamentally make Civ 5 complete.

Civ 5 has a sharp learning curve that heavily supports specific playstyle (though there are mods that negate this somewhat, making other methods viable).  It's a great singleplayer game for people who enjoy dissecting the mechanics of a game on top of the already enjoyable gameplay.

Even if you don't squeeze the game's mechanics like an orange, you'll find that basically every element of gameplay in Civ 5 is a nicely polished, fun, and interactive experience.

I'll say, 10+ years after release, it's likely you won't find any multiplayer lobbies, but the game is still very fun to play with your friends.

Overall a great pickup for a game you can dump loads of hours into."
6718,The epitome of turn based strategy. 10/10
6719,Just one more turn....
6720,"This game combines a variety of elements from visual appeal to historical fact, from strategic thinking to multitasking assets to manage an empire. It is not only fun, and yes addictive, but you can learn things along the way, such as history but more importantly how religion, culture, diplomacy etc. affect society. Or you can do none of that and just play to conquer!"

6748,superb
6749,"Civ never is boring- although once you get past the early game, the game slows down significantly. On the standard time mode, once you get into the industrial era or so, progression goes at a snail's pace. I would recommend this game to anyone who enjoys more strategic gameplay."

6807,"Loved Civ since v1. v5 has multiple facets to focus on, multiple ways to win, but is still ""clean and elegant"". Can play to win without ever being involved in a war, or soak your swords in blood. Magnificent."
6808,This may be the best Civ of them all. It has playbility that makes VI feel hollow. Enjoyed playing it with my sons for many hours.
6809,A classic.
6810,Hey any girls interested in learning about CIV5 lore? I'm a pretty nice fella and i'm interested in discussing CIV5 topics! Must be a lady! I absolutely love this game and everything about it!

Nothing against Civ4, but this one, for me at least, hits every mark perfectly. Aside from the notoriously horrible AI, Civilization 5 is the peak of the series. I never played the first one so I can't comment on that, but the 6th one was extremely off-putting for a Civ game. 

I'd love for Civ7 to be more alike Civ4 and Civ5, but incorporate aspects of Civ6 into it, such as districts and disasters.

Civ 5 in the pinnacle of the Civilization series thus far (with expansions)."
6813,gud
6814,"I swear when I play this game time jumps in the apollo mission and flys. Multiplayer has some connection and reloading issues, but can't really complain for a game of this age. 9/10"
6815,honestly i love the game i have been playing for years now with over 670+ hours in in if you like long turn based strategy games this is the one for you!!! hugely modifiable so you can make the game any way you want.
6816,"This was the first game I ever owned on my steam account, and wasn't always but now is one of my favorite games. The learning curb can be a lot, but once you get the hang of it, it's great fun. If you do get it, get the dlcs as well once they go on sale."
6817,V > VI
6818,Amazing game. Have come back to it time and time again over the years. 10/10
6819,"As someone who isn't an incredible strategist, I thoroughly enjoy this game. There's rarely a moment I'm not enjoying myself when I'm building up my empire. You should buy this game, especially the full DLC contents when they're on sale, and also if you love strategy games."
6820,gud
6821,I can assure that this game will please any player accustomed to strategic games and offer them many hours of fun (even with a bit of knowledge more about the history of our planet)
6822,"Single player mode is the kind of game that I like to call ""Lab Rat in a Maze Game"". There is zero room for improvisation or tactics. There is one or two ways of getting by without being struck down, and you have to adapt to that to keep playing, like a lab rat has to adapt to a maze in order to get food."
6823,"Have played way more of this game than any one person should but I loved every second of it. To me this is the only civ game to date that is this fun to play without being too simple or too complex. Not many games make you say to yourself, ""one more turn then im getting off"" and the next thing you know your on turn 400 and Ghandi is launching nukes at you. Easy game to sink time into and I would recommend this game to anyone who like world building and or strategy games."
6824,rip civ 6
6825,Fun game to play at anytime :)
6826,"great game, fun to play with friends"
6827,"Spent three hours pressing ""do nothing"" while I waited for my research to advance me into the modern age. 10/10 would do again."
6828,BEST STRATEGY GAME
6829,"Its Ok, I haven't really played it much."
6830,It's pretty good.
6831,"I found the city state of Kabul. It was sieged by barbarians.

10/10 for historical accuracy."
6832,DAMN THIS GAME THICK
6833,Way better than Civ 6!
6834,"Ghandi is your friend, he's just testing his nukes."
6835,its pog
6836,"Thew most solid turn based strategy game ever. You can also pick up a bit of a history lesson if you pay enough attention. Amusing to say the least, and its turn based so it can be paused and restarted at any time. A worth while game to try for any gamer."
6837,GOAT Strategy game
6838,really good game fun with friends

sigma rule 42069: only sigma males play on diety"
6840,yes
6841,you have made a horrible game
6842,Where did my 87 hours go?
6843,"This game gets you (me) hooked and makes me forget time. The graphics - I couldn't quite get it right on Linux. So the world leaders are just static images. And yet, the gameplay, the feeling of building and exploring and crushing your opponents. That is something I never get tired of."
6844,Its a good game.
6845,so much fun
6846,"Over 1,000 hours of playtime says a lot. This is hands-down one of the best strategy games out there, and probably the best in the series."
6847,"I would like to see some of the abilities of CIV IV restored, like stacking.  Would like ability to build tunnels, dig canals, remote airfields etc.  The CIV VI was a joke.
"
6848,"I have been playing this game for years so it is absolutely worth the money spent on it. I am still playing it and never getting bored. I much prefer this version to previous versions as well as CIV 6, it seems like they over complicated it where as CIV 5 is just right."
6849,"Is good, i love it. Is very good"
6850,Epic game. Lots of options!
6851,love it
6852,fun
6853,very good ghem yes
6854,great civilization game
6855,V doesn't have the revised land usage model that VI has so it's basically the last of the classic old model of the game where everything is built in cities.
6856,not bad
6857,pog
6858,its ok i guess better than  6
6859,civ 5
6860,Excellent Game!
6861,very epic
6862,Great game to mold your strategy and tactics in a relaxing environment.
6863,awesome series
6864,I mean... it's the best civ game ever made. Hands down.
6865,+1
6866,Just so i can play as kpop civs
6867,One....more....turn.....
6868,Best strategy game ever.
6869,It's the best.
6870,Yuh.
6871,"Great game save for the juvenile sense of humour of its makers seen in the diplomacy.  Also, the engine does tend to feel like it's cheating you at times - you experience this more the higher the difficulty.  

Civ 6 is in the shops and whilst probably better than this, I think this is the last incarnation of the game I'll be bothering with for the above reason."
6872,"One of the best 4x strategy games available that strikes a perfect blend of being accessible (compared to more complex, grand strategy games like EU4), being familiar, and being downright enjoyable. Civilization V succeeds over newer iterations of the franchise by having a better mod community and making the gameplay loop more addictive / less cumbersome compared to Civilization VI. Been playing since day one across multiple platforms, and I don't regret a single hour."
6873,Yes
6874,the closest digital reciprocal of crack cocaine addiction
6875,still a favourite of mine to play.
6876,"One of my favourite games ever - I have so far been able to play this continually for years now, both in single player as a great way to escape into a big interesting game and as a multi-player event. Although I would say that as a multi-player game you can sometimes be in for LONG waits, especially when playing with five players or more.
I think that only maybe Skyrim or Age of Empires comes close to this so far in terms of mileage, it's a masterpiece of strategy and 4x game style. I'm still learning things about this game nearly 400 hours in."
6877,A barbarian encampment has been discovered!
6878,A Barbarian Encampment has been discovered!
6879,Very addictive game!
6880,yes very good game
6881,"Awesome strategy game. Lots of depth, but is also fun for easy play."
6882,this game took hold of me
6883,great game
6884,I can see myself wasting many hours on this game...
6885,"First match lasted 11 hours

10/10"
6886,VERY GOOD GAME
6887,Not as great as people say b/c the AI cheats at higher difficulties.
6888,yes
6889,Great game - but you need a few hours and a few friends
6890,Easy to lose yourself into the game and each game is random so new strategy each play through.
6891,It's bretty gud.
6892,I just like Civ games in general and this is one of the better ones.
6893,It's okay I guess
6894,Super
6895,Near perfect strategy game.
6896,"It's fun, addicting, complicated, entertaining, and easily consumes hours of your life. Would recommend."
6897,This is the greatest accomplishment humankind (lol get it)? has ever produced.
6898,either be aggressive all the time or literally never build anything millitary until you're threatened
6899,
6900,I love it! Civ is addicting
6901,"it
s  
good"
6902,"this game is an absolute blast, best game ever played in my entire life, 10/10, would recommend"
6903,"good
"
6904,Good game.
6905,"To me the best Civilization game, I hope Civ 7 will be more of a spiritual succesor to this game. Civilization 6 has to many features and I prefer the more realistic graphics of this game."
6906,1233 hours and i still love this game. true classic highly recomend
6907,"Great game
would reccomend"
6908,Even if you don't buy the DLC for this game it can be fun once you know what you're doing. Not to mention that the game isn't that hard to learn for new players.
6909,Remind me a year later when i have a ridiculous amount of play time to make this review funny
6910,Fun to play. But it's sorta complex.
6911,yes
6912,"Very buggy.  I couldn't create a mine for uranium and so nuclear bombs and power plants were off the table.  My units stopped showing the 'heal' button, but then if I moved them to a new tile then it would show up.  Yet, by the next turn the unit(s) weren't healed.  Late game, I couldn't click on units in cities.  It's an old game at this point, but I thought it would at least be functional."
6913,I just can't find something negative to say.
6914,"This game is for people with personality disorders and warmongers like my ""ex"" friend Henry. He said he's been really into this game ever since he stopped taking his medication for his aggressive and severe anti-social, borderline schizophrenic mental disorders.

I do not recommend you play this game with anyone called Henry."
6915,Lover this game!!!
6916,Vry gud game : )
6917,Best Game ASSround
6918,Better than CIVs 6. Major waste of time. I like as well.
6919,Super Giant Death Robot
6920,Too good...
6921,Hours of fun
6922,good
6923,Great game. Starts out slow but turns out amazing mid game
6924,fun game
6925,fun
6926,A classic!
6927,The factory must grow
6928,yes
6929,Amazing game
6930,It turned all right once they added espionage and more complex diplomacy. Better than 4 and better than 6.
6931,pretty fun
6932,It's fun.
6933,well developed and  relaxing
6934,Humankind and Civ6 are prettier and have a better and more interactive world. But in terms of gameplay this is still the one to get.
6935,"can get lost in this game
"
6936,
6937,"kjnjkljno-0 49094lp[]am,klvxczlkhiosklasKLNMKNMJKHYTFTFAERDSCWFWVSCZVCXRW9 its ok 5/7 maybe 4/9"
6938,haha 31 hours in 3 days
6939,Fun
6940,better than civ 6
6941,nice lil' game
6942,how does this game even exist its so good
6943,Good!
6944,help me ive been taken hostage and they forced me to play this game send help
6945,"This game combines complex strategy and intricate game mechanics with simple-to-learn fundamentals in a way that I greatly enjoy. The singleplayer and multiplayer options both are a lot of fun, and the game has so many tiny details that I think everybody could enjoy.
From playing it as a relaxed civilisation builder to a full out war simulator, Civ V has definitely earned its reputation in my books."
6946,ery nice
6947,"By far the best game in this set, you will have THOUSANDS of hours of gameplay, as well as many differn't ways to play. Many achievements to earn, many civs to play as, this truly is a game that will stand the test of time!"
6948,slatt
6949,Another wonderful entry in the Civilization series.
6950,makes u wonder if u even like your friends
6951,"If you love the franchise, you will love this game. So much replayable value."
6952,"This game, if you can call it that, is so broken and has some of the worst development decisions ever made in gaming ever.
10/10 Would recommend to game development on how to make lots of money, for minimal effort"
6953,Best game ever made
6954,fantastic
6955,Good game.
6956,Thumbs UP!
6957,"Simple gamer concept, RULE THE WORLD, many options, lots of modification add-ons, can be addicting for the common 'just one more turn...' concept."
6958,"It's Civ V, if you like the others you'll like this one."
6959,"It's civ, it's good."
6960,前期很值得琢磨，后期就闷了。对比6代，可玩性稍强，当然还是最新版更顺滑。
6961,One of the best Civ games i've ever played. would recommend to anyone wanting a great turn based Strategy.
6962,"You will have to invest a lot of time up front to become good at this game and understand all of the mechanics. Full games are going to be at least 3 hours long on the quickest setting in singleplayer, and at least 5 hours long in multiplayer, so be prepared to sit there for a while. The game gets more boring as it goes along, but it will all be exciting at the beginning. I still play from time to time just for some fun, and after 4300+ hours in the game, I'm still finding enjoyment out of it, though not as much as when I first started. I don't play multiplayer though, it's way too inconsistent unless you have a group of people you know that will actually put the time in."
6963,Hard to fathom how much strategy there is. Don't think I can grasp it even with 80 hrs on record.
6964,I love this game
6965,hkihnkji
6966,Played this game a ton both solo and wi the friends and family. It is new player/non gamer friendly.
6967,Japan is the best
6968,Fun to play with friends against the AI
6969,"nice, i play"
6970,Lucien will never get on this game.
6971,better than civ 6
6972,"As of the date of this review, I personally enjoy this Civ a lot more then Civ 6"
6973,"Inferior product compared to the previous instalment. Apart from hexagonal movement Civilization IV did just about everything better. This one is, for the lack of a better word, designed too ""accessible"", at the expense of strategic depth.
It does seem too much like the Civilization I am given plays me, not the other way around. And the tech tree is way less interesting as far as choices are concerned.
The game is simply overtly designed to punish warmongering (""Oh, you destroyed a remote Player? Have fun having their useless Capital you are not allowed to Raze. Also you can not Raze holy Cities. Nor City States"") and large empires. It just does not seem like an Empire when I have all of five cities barely in contact with each other and ROADS cost upkeep to maintain.
And the policies of this one are inferior to the previous instalment that you just kinda have them all on at once instead of having to actually choose which benefits to have.


Tldr: Keep It Simple, Stupid version of Civilization IV with arbitrary restrictions and overtly simplified everything with somehow worse UI. Not a fan, going to play Civilization IV with K-mod AI improvement Mod on instead of this."
6974,Its good
6975,great game
6976,"its good if you have 30 hours for a game
"
6977,"I'm a Civ veteran who's played every version of the game from the olden days of diamond spaces and red 4/2 knights.  When i played Civ IV i had a tendency to slip back to Civ III when it felt like more of a troop upgrade without  the accompanying AI boost we wait for in new Civs.  Hands down the best version is V and i'm waiting for VII to be V with even better balance and a few inventions.  
"
6978,"This is a great resource management game, 11 years old and still amazing. Graphics are beautiful, story aspects amazingly crafted. Runs well and has so many different options on how to play the game. Endless playtime ahead."
6979,Just one more turn.
6980,This is the most epicest game of all time 11/10
6981,Its great
6982,Buy it! Play it! Just forget the rest of your life...
6983,yes.
6984,nice
6985,"The Multi-player has some issues, if someone joins or disconnects it can cause some abnormalities. In general I love this game and Enjoy playing it both solo and sometimes online. However, most of the people who do play online are hyper competative quick clickers who only play ""simultaneous"" moves to take the game from being a strategy game and making it a sort of ""FPS"" style mouse clicker, on who can click first to get in that second attack."
6986,"this is one of the best games i have ever played.

its better than 6 by a huge amount. Its significantly easier and doesnt over complicate things.

this game got me into history and has a huge impact on my life. play this game."
6987,I have some information that might be usefull
6988,Classic
6989,good
6990,"This is a good game, but it."
6991,.
6992,V gud
6993,"Wonderful game, I recommend it to anyone and everyone who has any sort of interest in turn based strategy games. I personally like 6 a little more, but I still love this game a ton."
6994,"Is good
"
6995,Great Game
6996,decent game icl
6997,Civ 4 better
6998,The game is great for strategy players
6999,How have people not played this lol
7000,nice
7001,FUCK YOU POLAND GET SHIT ONNNN!!!!
7002,Gahndi
7003,"Hard but extremely detailed and fun game if you like a challenge, fantastic addition to the series."
7004,stuff
7005,Game is way too buggy.  Downloaded it 15 times and will not load properly.  Total piece of shit
7006,it is fun
7007,
7008,Great game!
7009,good game yippeeee
7010,good
7011,yuh
7012,"It's good. The AI is almost good
"
7013,it good
7014,"One of my favorite games of all time. I have it for a lot of different systems, ps4, pc, and switch lol. The music is great, visuals are on point, turn base has never had a problem and i've played long campaigns without the game crashing, which is wonderful."
7015,bad total war
7016,one more turn
7017,It's good.
7018,"if you are into history and don't mind ""reading your way through a game"" then this is the game for you!"
7019,"The best of all the civ's and I've played them all. 

Skip civ 6 and buy this instead you won't regret it."
7020,Its ok
7021,cool game
7022,"Great game. If you just want to build cities and units and fight barbarians and have no war with other cigs, setup a massive map with 1 other competitor on easiest difficulty, long play. You'll have a relaxing time"
7023,Just one more turn.
7024,The best Civ game ever.Civ 6 sucks do not waste any money on that game.
7025,this game is replayable. 10 years later and i'm still finding ways to have fun
7026,next turn
7027,Gamer
7028,"The actual game is great, but Steam denies access on a consistent basis.  The Steam programs need further schooling."
7029,good game go buy
7030,Great game :)
7031,One of a few ways to play Germany and conquer the world.
7032,wayy better than civ 6. very immersive
7033,nah don't buy it i just left the screen on the main menu
7034,Is good
7035,GG
7036,AWESOME TOO FUN!!!!
7037,"a good game to test your thinking ability lol !!
"
7038,its civ. you understand
7039,iz gud
7040,It gets slow when societies build out but overall it keeps your interest.  Endless war is proving a hardship...
7041,enjoyable game
7042,Crashes randomly after playing for a while. Cant even end task. I have to use windows button and restart the PC.
7043,nice
7044,fun.
7045,i hate the romans
7046,i played >17 hours the first day I played.... yeah this game is a problem
7047,I enjoy playing this game with friends.
7048,they will learn our peaceful ways BY FORCE
7049,"I have over 550 hours on record. Clearly, I enjoy this game.

I like all the entries into the Civ franchise (yes, even Beyond Earth) but this one is hands down the best in my book. I love the way that you can have a cultural victory. The whole idea of culture the way Civ V deploys it is interesting. The tourism, which is bolstered by by the world wonders...finally, it all starts to make sense how you become a dominant civilization, much more than the previous entries.

If you're trying to decide between 5 and 6, I'd go for 5. I can't seem to get into Civ VI the way I got into V. It's got the best aspects of the early Civ games without the cumbersome, repetitiveness of Civ 3 and 4 (automate your cities when you get to a large civ!). The difficulty levels scale nicely and the scenarios are actually interesting."
7050,roads
7051,HEHEHEHBEST GAMEEE
7052,Great Game
7053,"great game
"
7054,👍
7055,
7056,Game Bad :(
7057,"Its alright, better than Civ 6."
7058,Can DESTROY the French - 10/10
7059,"Bought it, thought ""oh hey this is pretty fun"" when i played it for 2 hours. and then i realized it had actually been 12 hours"
7060,this shit GOATed like forreal
7061,"gud game
"
7062,"Very fun game, really makes you FEEL like a civilization"
7063,much fun
7064,Exciting game
7065,"A great game to play versus the AI or with friends. I'd say it's better than Civ VI, if you're wondering which one to buy."
7066,V nice i like
7067,Just ... one ... more ... turn!
7068,civ vi but not bad
7069,Crashes on opening on mac
7070,Love all civ games.
7071,.
7072,Significantly better than the next installment in the franchise.
7073,"Game at one point must of been great. But it runs at a shit 20 frames tops. Not sure why people regard this better than civ 6 despite it being an 11 year old game it runs terrible. I've had other older games run way better than this from the very start. Had to request a refund immediately. I have a 2080 Geforce GTX, i9 10 gen processor and 64 GB of RAM no reason the game should run like ass."
7074,GOOD
7075,fun
7076,Rome forever
7077,Good Game. Very Fun. Fun with friends. Better than Civ 6. Full Game + DLC only $15
7078,best game in the civ series
7079,An awesome classic!
7080,"i don't actually own Humankind on steam so i'm putting my review for it here
5/5"
7081,UH it go pew pew when you go doo doo
7082,It's Civ 5. What else is there to say?
7083,I've been playng the Civilization series since Civ I.  Probably my favorite game ever.
7084,will not load
7085,"This is the perfect game to zone out playing and also offers so many different stages switching things up regularly, awesome game."
7086,Just... One... More.. Turn
7087,Obviously a great game. You should know that by now.
7088,"If you have things to do, don't play this game.
"
7089,I've played over 376 hours... so that's a strong endorsement.
7090,Just dont like it. Campaign had a shit story and quite frankly the multiplayer wasn't much better.
7091,"Between this and Civ VI, I'm going with Civ V every time. One of the best games ever made, can't even think of anything wrong with it."
7092,strategy
7093,i like nuke-ing civilians
7094,"I tried this game for about 9,000 hours.  It's alright."
7095,"Civ V is the game I keep coming back to over and over. I do also play other Civ editions and love those also but, V has the right balance of features. I will take over the work again and again foreVer."
7096,One more click.
7097,"Genre defining game. I really liked 4, 5 is polished perfect, 6 pisses me off. Play this game, then play it for 500 more hours. YW."
7098,It's fun
7099,"Be careful, one turn can turn into 16 hours irl real quick."
7100,A really nice series of games.
7101,Warcrimes
7102,Excellent game. Beautiful.
7103,Better than Civ 6 AND HUMANKIND!
7104,"Can be fun to manage your empire, but can get monotonous lategame when you have a lot of units, many of which you have to control individually each turn. Definitely not fast-paced IMO."
7105,"Awesome, better than CIV VI"
7106,This game is a great time burner. I have been playing it through numerous deployments and has given me a lot of enjoyment. if you ave not played it I recommend you do and play all victories.
7107,great game
7108,A pretty good 4X game.
7109,gg
7110,Totally a classic!
7111,Wonderful game
7112,GOAT
7113,shit game

7115,best civ so far
7116,"There is a place somewhere between time and space that let's you melt away hours of your life one turn at a time.  You'll be like, where in 7 hells did those last 4 hours go?  The answer will never be found."
7117,Still fun to play years later
7118,OK
7119,yes
7120,"Extremely boring tedious game (look at my play hours as a proof). I bought it on sale with a huge discount and still regret that I did, and I am a fan of turn-based grand strategies. 
I did not plan to review it, because I don't care about this game, but I noticed that Civ fanboys are currently bombing HUMANKIND which is a very good game, so I feel like it will be only fair to bomb back, mutual destruction as they say."
7121,it gud
7122,fun
7123,its cool
7124,Corona quarantine with mates escalated into global nuclear war. 5/5 would recommend.
7125,Best game ever
7126,good
7127,I love turn based strategy games and the diversity of cultures and upgrades allows for hours of gameplay!
7128,"Arguably one of the best strategy games, even in 2021. There's lots of depth and variety in the civilizations that you choose, as well as world generation, leading to every game being different and forcing the player to adapt. The many facets of history implemented into this game make for lots of great trivia, and does truly make for an exciting experience for anyone intrigued by world history. 

Local multiplayer outside of 2 players can be extremely janky, especially when reloading a previous save for a game. That being said, if your intention is to play against the computer (not a bad option), or simply play with one other person, this game should offer an incredible experience."
7129,The game mechanics can be a bit of a bother but the game is challenging.
7130,"If its Saturday and you've got a lot of time to spend, this is your game."
7131,My go-to game when I need to relax and chill.
7132,The king of all 4X (and all civ iterations). And Vox Populi is its crowning glory.
7133,Better and more interesting to play any Total War game series
7134,9.2/10.0

7136,big brain time
7137,I don't understand how this game was so good and I put so many hours into it while civ6 is a mobile game.
7138,"yea

7139,I loved it.
7140,The best Civ game.
7141,"allows new players into rts genre ease to get into it
"
7142,eh
7143,one of the greatest strategy games of all times.
7144,Alliances are meant to be broken.
7145,fun
7146,"fun game to play
"
7147,"I've played the series since Civ IV. Like all the Civ titles, there are play styles and Civs which clearly are overpowered, but the game doesn't seem to advertise it being *too* serious. Honestly, it's just fun to play as a Civ that fits your ""aesthetic"" and roleplay as a benevolent ruler or a warlord."
7148,"Super long time since I placed this game.  Still one of the worst error prone games I've ever played.  I love the game design as a whole, but I hate trying to play it.  It is very hard to play with so many graphics glitches, sound errors, and animation issues, and way too many CTD's.  It is just so terribly programmed.  It is a shame.  Yes this is over the years, on three completely different gaming rigs and a modern high-end gaming laptop too.  Sad."
7149,Still fun to play years later
7150,.
7151,good game
7152,pog game
7153,"This is the best turn based strategy game ever. Being able to win the game through a diplomatic, cultural or military strategy creates great diversity. If only Civilization 6 wasn't crap in comparison."
7154,Yes
7155,Best civilisation game by far.

7159,i love it when a songhai empire from america just colonizes asia along with the mongols in south america
7160,by far the best Civ game! I cant get enough of this game.
7161,"Been playing Sid Meir's Civ game for 30 years.  Absolute brilliant game.  It is so addictive...""one more click"".  Would think it would be great education for kids of all ages, adults as well.  So well done.  Guaranteed enjoyment."
7162,"Enjoy the game, makes you think"

7169,such a good game 10 villagers out of good nose
7170,"is good boredom game
"
7171,"Over 500 hours played and a year since I last played, I just reinstalled the game. Civ 5 is life."
7172,Careful. Very addictive.
7173,"I played this game a little and found it decent, but only with friends."
7174,Very nice
7175,better than civ 6 and if you disagree your opinion is wrong.
7176,very nice
7177,It's alright.
7178,"This game is full of many complex variables that make it as realistic as can be expected. Once you have mastered the game it is very enjoyable to build the civilization you want to have. One warning, the AI are extremely bad at tactics during war so don't fear if you are outnumbered."
7179,it's ok
7180,very entertaining with very different senerios and experience levels
7181,Y
7182,GOOOD
7183,"Nostalgia, love to play it again"
7184,v good
7185,"I'm very biased as I've played Civilization from the first version in the late '80's.  Each new version of the game, in the beginning,  takes a little to get used to, which is part of the experience. Some versions a little longer than others but I will always eagerly transition to the upgrades because they really are better.  They are harder and more intense with each new version.  Civilization 5 not so much but there is a transition to Civilization 6 that I have enjoyed.  I often go back to the earlier versions and find them that much easier with all the new skills developed from the latest game.  I hope you enjoy it as much as I have."
7186,Best Civilization game :)
7187,"It is fun, I'm still in the tutorial"
7188,"was good

7189,I still think this is the best Civ game

7194,"Such a great game! Can be as involved as you want it to be, as fast or slow as you want it to be. Just a great game"
7195,its really fun and is a great game
7196,"Strangely enough, that is the only Civ style game I am keep on returning to. Especially after 6 rather idiotic religion system. By the way Humankind sucks comparing to Civ games"
7197,Fun game. You can play very fast or very slow.
7198,This is the best civilization game by sid meier
7199,I'm scared to load this game up because last time I did I came so close to dying of dehydration after not realizing I'd spent 2 straight days obsessing over my conquest of the world. Time became an illusion and basic human needs became an afterthought. This game is crack. 10/10
7200,sucks bad
7201,Totally engaging and engrossing
7202,Its shit when Dave plays!
7203,time-killing master piece
7204,My second favourite Microsoft Excel alternative
7205,sound
7206,It's good.
7207,"This game is fun, and very addicting, but a huge time-sink and not in a good way. 

Let me explain why. 

A good chunk of the game is waiting for the next turn in order to do something to advance a civilization. A lot of the civilizations are cool, and done very well - including voice acting. The concepts and ways to achieve it done very well - including the dlc's - which focuses on beating your opponents down through raw power, subduing them through religion by using missionaries, and finally, just a game of politics/ economics. In general though, not all of these work, or maybe it never worked for me. I usually hate to brute force someone into submission to win a full map.

A lot of the AI makes no sense on the higher difficulties. If you are next to Genghis Khan or the huns, be prepared to get get denounced, attacked, and then asked to be made a peace treaty and an embassy, only to be attacked again. Other times, the ""war monger"" negative attribute effects you so much more than other players on the same map. 

I really liked the troop system, and upgrades, including the dlc system, but some of them straight out felt unnecessary. I never understood if I was playing the game wrong, or perhaps, differently than I was supposed to, but like most of the troops took too long, or did so little damage that they didn't matter. On top of that, let's say you are playing the arms race game, for some odd reason you might be able to make an atomic bomb, but like other civilization do the same, even though it seems like they are going through the religion fault lines (yes, I know about spies as well, and they didn't steal any plans, as far as I know).

Overall, I can't recommend this. It's a fun game, but at the end of almost 5 matches I just felt like there was really nothing in this game. I didn't feel smarter, just felt like I wasted my time with a game that took too long to succeed in, and an AI that felt bullshit. Cool depictions, and ideas, but yah..."
7208,pretty good
7209,Yes!
7210,"It is a very fun empire building game. I would highly suggest it.
"
7211,One more turn!!!!!
7212,An old favourite.
7213,I love this game it teaches you tactics and a blast to play. Build destroy empires or win with a single city. lots of different victors just play to have fun even multi players get to have blast.
7214,Best strategy game out there
7215,Not bad...quite buggy at times...but you can spend ages in it....
7216,Not for me
7217,Don't start a game the night before a big exam thinking you'll only play for an hour. Just don't...
7218,great game.  Been playing since Civ 1.    I wish this version had more options to develop faith without having to wait for missionaries.
7219,based
7220,Very fun to play by yourself +rep
7221,"if im gonna exile to a dimension with no one  in it forever and only allowed to carry with one game, i think i will choose Civ V"
7222,Got me interested in politics.
7223,"Great game that I keep coming back to, especially when I need a break from FPS. However just be aware that you will lose track of time, hours feel like minuets and before you know it you have been playing for 10+ hours. This is the true OG."
7224,nice
7225,It's a classic endless fun and creativity. Testing out what works best is always fun
7226,its ok i think
7227,Best strategy game of its time no exceptions
7228,"Pretty easy to pick, but more challenging to master :)"
7229,i play it. it fun.
7230,I love this game and years after the release of civ 6 I still prefer civ 5.
7231,Timeless game play. Version VI is not as good.
7232,"This is widely regarded as the standard civilization game, and for good reason. The game is a blast once you get used to the game systems. I highly recommend this game."
7233,pretty fun
7234,great game. lots of hours in it
7235,Great game all around.
7236,Great game in 4x genre
7237,"5 more turns with friends transforms into ""Why is it bright outside?"""
7238,"great game
a must play"
7239,"why have i played civ 5 for 3028, anyway, good game 8/10"
7240,Awesome game for co-op
7241,i only play this game when i am incredibly stressed out and need something to take my mind of it. but great game i like this one better than XI
7242,"amazing game, be prepared for 100s of hours of gameplay"
7243,"For the longest time my rarest achievement was for finishing Civ 5, since I didn't realize you're not supposed to complete the game. The right way to play is to quit after a few hundred rounds of each random setup ad nauseam.

Besides achievements I don't have much to warrant a game recommendation. Compared to Civ 1 this is decent, but it's a bummer you can't stack troops. I think you could in Civ 1. Anyway it's a pretty cool series and Sid seems like a down-to-earth dude, so that makes this a thumbs up in my books."
7244,fun
7245,good
7246,I was still playing tutorial and was very hooked and forgot i couldn't save.

7254,one more turn
7255,"Civ 5 is one of the only rts games that I actually like (the others being other Civ games). I don't know what Civ is doing differently from other rts games, but they hit the gold spot when they did it because this is one of my favorite games."
7256,Most addictive series I've ever encountered. 10/10.
7257,Good game
7258,game
7259,rush science and play single player in mp or rush mil and kill everyone. very stale after 1 playthrough. Still addicting conquering the other players though.

7261,my friends say i should go outside.
7262,download pcp
7263,This is the best civ game yet. Civ 5 > Civ 6 so don't bother buying 6
7264,yes
7265,Lots of fun with friends! Lots more for me to learn
7266,"war mongering is fun, they should make it a real thing:)"
7267,nice
7268,so much fun having all wonders in 1 city and not having to  deal with districts
7269,"Challenging, yet fun! Worth the money."
7270,nice
7271,"It's a classic. If you haven't played Civ and have any interest in history, strategy, or just the element of building up your nation, play this game."
7272,Good
7273,Good game with lots of options for how you want to build your civilization.
7274,f
7275,not bad
7276,Simpler than Civ VI. Plays faster.
7277,Its fun and way better then civ 6
7278,Great game. New experiences with every new game.
7279,yeah
7280,"As the Japanese Empire I am happy to spread the Religion of GTA V to my fellow national empires, so that their populace can become enthralled by technology and distracted when my fleet lands on their shores and the dirges of war begin with the dropping of atomic fire."
7281,"So engrossing. And this Civ, I think, is easier to understand than earlier games. Love it!"
7282,
7283,I've played all the versions of Civ over the years and this one has proved to be one of my favorites.
7284,"It's a great game, what else is there to say"
7285,Good game
7286,"A great game that holds its own after 11 years, it’s different enough from Civ VI gameplay to recommend. Easy to learn, easy to get completely sucked into and lose all sense of time. There’s something for casual players and turn-based-strategy veterans alike. I'm a big fan of the art style, it makes the world and civilizations feel very real. It was my first introduction to the Civ franchise and I’d recommend it to someone who hasn’t played Civ and doesn’t want to pay full price for Civ VI, or a casual player who’d want to try turn-based strategy."
7287,top notch
7288,help
7289,"I really enjoy playing, cause I have to look ahead, as you do in chess.  But this is more visually stimulating."
7290,A timeless strategy game that I will always enjoy.
7291,"Hundreds of hours behind and  I still think having much to learn. This is THE turn-based strategy game. Get completed edition and watch your free-time gets wasted into this masterpiece. Protip: ""Do not make trade agreement with England"""

7300,its alright
7301,I have a bunch more hours on the OSX version of the game that I didnt own on steam from years ago. This game is the fucking goat.

7307,"Ton of fun, especially when played hot seat or online."
7308,"good game with good music, but bad programming and so many bugs. If someone disconnects they can't rejoin a private game."
7309,its alright
7310,"I admit there's a nostalgic bias with this game. But, for me it has transcended nostalgia and is more like Chess or Monopoly at this point, timeless and infinitely replayable."
7311,DON'T. TRUST. THE ZULUS.
7312,Best civ ever
7313,this game transformed me into a fabulous gay man and i could not be happier!
7314,good

7330,wicked fun totally reccomend
7331,it's amayzin
7332,.
7333,"its not a bad game. its okish, but it does not have good support.

pros:
-basic civ, this is the starting point of simplistic civy games. for more interesting experiences look elsewhere


cons:
-mod support is terrible and i couldnt get them to work properly, also they were only some small changes and nothing major.

play this game if you want to look at the basic civ 4x game, for more indepth and possibility of experience customization look elsewhere"
7334,"Lets you annex China, would play again 10/10"
7335,"Percentage increase buildings giving you the option to build tall as well as wide, not harvesting your personal data... this game is far and above Civ 6"
7336,"Its good, but only with the dlc en community patches"
7337,"I started playing CIVILIZATION way back in the early 1990s, guess it was version 1 oder 2 then. The game has developed a lot over the years and to me CIV II and CIV V have proven to be the best versions. There are too many reasons why and I doubt anybody will read this anyway, so for CIV V let's just mention that it has the best optical appeal so far. CIV VI in comparison is more like Disneyland. So that never really attracted me and I stick to CIV V since CIV III cannot be played on my modern Mac anymore. Unfortunately."
7338,just one more turn
7339,very fun
7340,"Friends, I have played this game a lot. This game got me into the genre, but I still come back to Civ very frequently. What an absolute treasure of a game. If it were a dog I would give it a nice pat on the head.

Five stars, one of my favorite games of all time"
7341,Definitely the best strategy game I have yet to have played. Leaves Civ. 6 in the dust in my opinion. Much more addicting and less constraining compared to earlier and later releases in the series. Modding also makes this game much more interesting.
7342,it is still an amazing strategy game that only gets better with friends
7343,Fun game similar to Age of Empires
7344,Yes
7345,super chill fun turn-based game. my dad and i have spent hours on this
7346,game
7347,would recommend
7348,It is a 5 star game. It never gets old.
7349,The greatest game ever!!!!!
7350,"i prefer civ 5 to civ 6. i have played it for a long time intimately and its a good game to sink your teeth into, id recommend it for having a relaxed type of game."
7351,Great game!
7352,I enjoy the game play. For me its a relaxing strategy game that you can tweek the difficulty to your liking
7353,very nice i like commiting war crimes
7354,"Love it, highly preferred to 6 but you may feel different"
7355,Get it on sale for $14
7356,"Still a better game than Civ 6.

Give me Civ 5 on the switch with its DLC and I'll buy it instantly."
7357,i guess its okay
7358,"I love RTS games, and this one has so many paths to victory. The tech trees are also pretty immersive."
7359,"The DLC won't stay off, and there is no option to make it stay off in the DLC menu."
7360,Would I recommend this game? Judging by the hours... yeh
7361,good
7362,n
7363,Great replayability.
7364,"I have played Civ 1, Civ 2, Civ 3, Civ 4, and Civ 5.  I like some aspects of 4 better, but 5 is a very solid game and worth the visit for a civ veteran.  I admit that I miss doomstacks, but you can make it work.  At first I didn't like the way that civics happened, but now I have come to like it.  It makes sense that the best effects take the most time to unlock."
7365,"Each Civilzation game is a like a drug. you'll lose track of hours...days even. I've tried to quit but I always come back for more. If you love strategy and/or builder games you will absolutely love Civilization. it is the best of the best!

Civ V has some interesting updates from Civ IV - the switch from a square grid system to a hex grid and the elimination of unit stacks are the two that most greatly effect the gameplay. these two changes have made Civ V a very different game from previous titles in the franchise. I have loved re-learning how to conquer the world with Civ V, and you will too!!

"
7366,"great game, always gave up before finishing, very repetitive, really fun"
7367,like 6 but 5
7368,Very fun
7369,Best version of Civ.  Love it
7370,"Next to Civ 2, this has been the best Civ game I've played. This game IS better than Civ 6."
7371,"Many customization options, great visuals, etc, eetc, etc,"
7372,This is the best Civilization Title produced.
7373,I have been playing Civ now for over a decade. I love the strategy required as well as the micro-managment.
7374,Best version
7375,"ehhhh, its ok"
7376,The most excited I've been for the franchise since Alpha Centauri!!!
7377,This might be my favorite video game of all time. And I have played a lot of video games!
7378,It is hands-down the best strategy game of all-time.
7379,my girlfriend hates this game
7380,"Som to nechapal čo sa deje, hram Civko tuna."
7381,"Better and more playable than VI and other subsequent versions. I stick to this one, thank you very much!"
7382,Should I recommend a game I've played for over 1000 hours? Do you reckon me a sadist? Is my moral competence projected to be so low that I would wish this obsession upon another human being?
7383,it's aight
7384,fønn
7385,"step 1: rush great library
step 2: curse cause you didn't get great library

7386,it's pretty good
7387,Excellent
7388,"Interesting game that keeps me hooked for hours, and a fun way to learn some history plus make your own!"
7389,It's good so far
7390,it's pretty fun nerd game
7391,"Strategic, dynamic"
7392,"Great game, probably best one in series"
7393,"It's like Factorio, but for a Civilization (heh) You keep thinking of things to improve your position, from civil planning to military review. I myself constantly monitor the demographics of other civilizations to see who's struggling and how, so as to conquer them, which reminds me of something I've thought of in my days of playing this game. I find that over the course of a game, you go through a cycle of 3 stages: 

Gabagool, a neutral or slightly positive state, highlights of this stage are economic stability or even prosperity, supporting that is equally good happiness, whether or not you are in an actual golden age is irrelevant. Even on harder difficulties, A.I. should be wary to take on a civ who is the equivalent of a healthy adult. Though, this stage is much like how when critical mass is achieved with grasshoppers, they turn into locusts, and just like them a critical-mass civ goes into the next stage.

WAAAGH, similar to Gabagool, you are usually not economically unstable when heading into battle, and this stage is indicated with a war that is beneficial or barely problematic, usually applied to civilizations who are on a strong, well thought-out invasion, though applying WAAAGH status to a Civ with strong defenses, or of which the war is practically unnoticeable beyond the rallying and subsequent clashing of troops, is not out of the question. Though if hefty conquest is carried out in this stage without careful management of gained territories, a civ's tools of war will instantly dull beyond recognition, and whatever havok that was being wrought would do well to be put on hiatus, as serious attention will be required for the next stage.

Uh Oh, probably the stage I've been in for most of my playtime. Theoretically, heavy amounts of annexation can be had without this stage occuring, though I can't say I've ever had the patience to pull off such a feat. This stage is noted for having lethal amounts of unhappiness in an empire, USA amounts of per-turn gold payments, and not a small amount of (at least for the moment) useless cities, almost certainly contributing to both previously mentioned problems. If a civ comes out of this stage alive, they most likely have Sayan lineage, and their power has multiplied from before they went into this stage accordingly, without a doubt putting them back into the Gabagool Stage. Though, that being said, if there's a stage to die, it would be this one, as civilizations, much like real life, usually only ever go out in a slow and low whimper, and especially not when they are at they're heights.

This cycle can be out of order at times, or stages might be skipped, but from my experience this cycle can and will repeat itself until the end of the game.

Tldr: 10/10, game so good it made me write like over 20 words about it."
7394,yes
7395,"Easy to pick up, bit harder to master but there's certainly enough info on the internet to help you (& the game also guides you pretty well)"
7396,vERY GOOD
7397,good god what a time sink. barbarians are so annoying. it feels like you have to play oda. and who doesnt love spending 2 hours in a game to learn you where screwed from the start. i would say get it if its ever .99 cents
7398,Can be exhausting if set to marathon.

7400,Amazing game

7402,A
7403,its civ 5. everyone should play it!
7404,This game is a balanced strategy but it can demand a lot of time and finishing an online game is impossible. If you are patient enough the game is worth it.
7405,Best turn based strategy game
7406," One of my favorite games of all time, I like challenging myself by winning peaceful victories without taking out other civs."
7407,Favorite of all Civ games.
7408,lit
7409,its good
7410,Its a very calm-slow- game that never really changes.now this is good sometimes but not all the time
7411,Great Mods (really great). Basegame is unplayable.
7412,"I don't always understand what the hell I'm doing, but I still end up playing for hours and hours and hours."
7413,cool
7414,"Civ VI has improved upon nearly every system and mechanic in the game, at no real cost to the experience. It's the easiest Civ to play, but it's also the most complex Civ to date. There's enough default automation that you can ignore a lot of the minutia if you want, but micromanagers like myself will still have all the tedium they can dream of. There's nothing quite as satisfying as pillaging every single tile in an aggressive neighbor's civilization."
7415,"i LOVE THE LONG TERM STRATEGIC PLANNING AND IMPLEMENTATION ASPECT. NOT JUST A SHOOTER STYLE WAR GAME. WIN WITH A COMBINATION OF MILITARY, CULTURAL AND RESOURCE MANAGEMENT SKILLS"
7416,its okay
7417,"better than civ 6
"
7418,Yes
7419,"its civ, a good game"
7420,"The Native Linux support for about the first 4 years was rock solid. Then starting in 2016 I saw my first crash of this game. Starting in about 2020 crashes became more frequent occasionally  once/twice per game. Now that I have bought a new System76 laptop with RTX 3050  GPU it  crashes every 2 turns or so make this game unplayable.  Both Laptops are running ubuntu 20.04, Use NvMe storage, and NVidia GPU.

I have proton entirely disabled in case it was trying to use the Windows version and increased the number of allowed threads, and a few other things.

For comparison I played Torch Light I and Civilization VI for a few hours and encountered no crashes during that time."

7422,"I've played 167 hours and steam is finally asking if I enjoy the game. I think I go without saying, its a good game"
7423,Amazing
7424,pizza is everywhere
7425,One of the greatest game in history
7426,This is the best turn based strategy game that exist out there. Don't bother with civ 6.
7427,Best out of the series by a good measure.
7428,One of the best games I ever had!
7429,haha venice great merchants make city states go brrr very funny i had -16 amenities and my citizens turned against me i lost the game fuck you indonesia pile of garbage piece of shit fuck you
7430,"My all time favorite was Civ III Play The World, but this, especially since the release of civ VI, i have made this my second fav of all time in sid miers history."
7431,"135 hours, just finished my first game. it was pretty fun."
7432,I enjoy this version more the Civ VI
7433,
7434,I prefer this version over Civ6.
7435,Ghandi fucked my shit and my Empire lasted for 10 turns. This game's a trip.
7436,cool game
7437,"is good

7438,My friend and I literally nuked Denmark out of existence. This is DLC but we banned silk which was the only luxury he had access to. Then we put him out of his misery. 10/10 Would nuke Denmark again.
7439,its fine i guess
7440,Intuitive and addictive
7441,It is good.
7442,"This is a fun continuation on a classic. I was able to play it for a week, now the 2k launcher will not even open the game. Thinking it was my pc, I did a fresh install on a different machine. Same result. I've seen lots of posts are for folks that just recently experiencing this problem. If its this launcher that's problematic, then scrap it."
7443,amazing
7444,Brain opium. Better than Civ 6; Change my mind.
7445,"great game
"
7446,"A major waste of time. 

I like."
7447,So sick
7448,It's Civ5.
7449,"Hehe.  Ok starting off.  I don't actually have 2300 hours.  The nice thing about this game is you can play a bunch of turns, go do errands, go to work, play with your kids, and then come back to the computer and do a bunch more.  That combined with steam not actually turning the game off when I quit leads to heavily inflated game hours.  

That all being said.  I have played a ton.

I actually didn't like the base game after playing civ 4.  But after all the expansions civ 5 is probably the best installment in the series.  Loved 4, disliked 3, loved 2, 1 is a bit old, and 6 just doesn't feel right.

The beauty of 5, like 4, is mods add to nearly infinite replayability.  I'm currently playing the Vox Populi Mod that kind of revamps the entire base game and morphs it into something completely new while still holding onto the concept of build an empire and destroy all others.

In short.  If you end up liking this game.  You got hundreds of hours ahead of you.  You won't find a better value."
7450,Based
7451,Always a blast playing
7452,I've been playing Civ sine the very first one came out.  I enjoy it and would like anyone and everyone to play it!!
7453,Seriously addictive...
7454,"Fun, cool, educational, not diverse at all.  
"
7455,Strategy game of ages
7456,It is a great strategy game and tests a player's skills against real opponents or the computer.
7457,Noice
7458,8h/day
7459,"By far the most hours I've put into a game.  The feel / balance, graphics and gameplay is definitely peak CIV.  I still come back and play this years later.  Cannot recommend enough."
7460,good
7461,fun
7462,"What a banger. Grab it on sale for nigh on nothing with all DLC and this game is genuinely amazing, even though slogging through a full length campaign in these games has always worn me out lol"
7463,very fun but make sure you play with the right people 7.4/10
7464,"Civili(s)ation 5 is indubitably a great game.
Yes the visuals maybe dated unlike it's successor Civ6... my rebuttal to that is... have you seen Suleiman in the leader scene? He's a god.
If you haven't played a game like Civili(s)ation before, the game is not that hard to get into. 

The gameplay is simple, you build units using production, settle settler units, expand your territory, fight dumb AI (they're pretty terrible, but not Paradox terrible), and win according to many victory types.

Just beware of getting into the pitfall of ""one more turn"" because it will lead you to question your choices at 5am"
7465,"Despite its age and limitations, it is still much better than Civ6!"
7466,it is good.
7467,This game is so awesome pogger
7468,"Great art, complex strategy game, lots of mod good game 10/10 legend"
7469,This game is almost 12 years old and still I find it much more enjoyable than civ 6! I dont like the newer cartoony look of civ 6 and I know im not the only one. This game has just enough complexity to keep it interesting without feeling like a chore to learn. I hope that civ 7 in the future recaptures some of this more classic style to the game.
7470,good game.
7471,As Douglas MacArthur said : Nuke em
7472,honestly i dont do anything except set up caravans and play friendship simulator
7473,"Rather than give a whole Spiel about why I love this game, how much I love this game, yadda yadda, I will tell ya'll a story. It's my favorite one to go to when I talk about this game.

So I was playing as the Shoshone and I was in the early stages of the game. I didn't have much of a military, and I only had like...two or three cities, hard to recall. So of course when I got a war declaration from Napoleon, I was like ""I guess this is where my game ends,"" but started producing soldiers in all my cities to try and see how long I could hold out. Fortunately, this was the smart move rather than quitting, because he declared war on two other civilizations during his invasion of my territory. These were Songhai and America. The three of us were small civilizations, but unlike me, they had small armies while mine was a last ditch effort to defend myself. This also put France in a bad situation as it was now in a three front war, though it did have a big army and more cities than us.
To paint the scene on a map, think of it as a triangle with Songhai to the north, me to the west, and america to the east. 

Songhai being the strongest of this little ""alliance,"" he was carving a bloody path through the north. France had devoted the majority of it's forces to the west since I was his first target of war, and he had split forces off to deal with America since he declared war on them while I was struggling to fight back, so the north was his weakest front. Any reinforcements he build from this point on had to be sent to reinforce the northern front, giving me and America a fighting chance. With the west and east fronts forces weakened, we started pushing through them to their center. I took cities, Songhai took cities, America took cities. This was a great boost to my economy and fighting power.

Songhai dropped out of the war first, accepting peace talks with France. Trying to lord the power they still had over me, they asked for peace and wanted me to give some of their cities back. I refused and continued my war. America dropped out next, and it was me alone against France. However, during this war, I had taken multiple cities and had the middle of this triangle under my control, separating my former allies territory in case they ever wanted to go to war. France still continued to ask for cities back. I continued to refuse their offers since the back foot, had started this war, and continue to ask for cities back. I take a few more, and their peace offer is more reasonable this time. They give me resources and money, and finally stopped asking for cities back. I accept.

They rebuild for a little while, though their empire is never to be at the strength it once was. When they believe it to be, they declare war again. It wasn't even a challenge, it was more of a slaughter.  I took their remaining cities."
7474,"Well made
"
7475,"Probably the best modernized Civ, a few annoying sounds cannot be muted, but that's how it is. Don't buy 6, V is plenty."
7476,"World domination is quite a fantasy, and in Civilization V it is not only possible - it is fun!!!"
7477,Fun
7478,This is one of the best games of all times and certainly the best strategy ever. Excelent replayability value makes it ideal to lose yourself into it.
7479,"My trust issues are justified.
Very recommended, 10/10 
"
7480,"This is probably the most addicting turn base game I have ever payed. Turn after turn you get sucked into the experience of leading your empire and see yourself planning carefully each move, since any kind mistake greatly affects your chances at achieving the different victory types. The aesthetics and mechanics of this entry in the series are just perfect and (in my opinion) they will never manage to develop a Civilization game that topples Civ V. With all the expansions and DLC, this is one of the best turn base strategy games you can buy."
7481,"Great game, play it only if you want your day gone. Maybe a few more days too.
Seriously. You lose track of time!
Beware!"
7482,yes
7483,fun
7484,Gandhi has my family

7488,the english love it
7489,It Good
7490,"Been playing this game on and off since it's release, and it's far superior to civ 6 in my opinion. The mods that have been released over the years add immense replayability. This version of Civ really captures both the ""macro"" element of a strategy game with good 4X gameplay, whereas Civ 6 introduced far too much micromanagement which is why I keep coming back to this one. Favourite mod is ""125 components"", which gives every civilization 5-6 unique units/building/improvements rather than the standard two."
7491,Used to play this game for hours on end with my dad. super fun casual game to pass the time with.

7493,I know nothing

7495,fart
7496,Great Game
7497,Hours of fun and frustration. Though mostly replaced by Civ 6 it seems; Civ 5 is still my go to game for a couple of hours of fun.
7498,great strategy game. watch out for ghandi.
7499,"Played the game as a kid and forgot about it until recently. Just went on a binge and put like 20 hours into a single campaign and conquered the world on easy mode. Was pretty fun and addicting but not sure if it will continue to be so as it feels like subsequent campaigns are more or less the same, even when playing as different civs. Multiplayer seems like it would be more replayable and maybe singleplayer on harder difficulties but idk. Regardless, this is worth 5 to 10 bucks and is definitely worth a buy for any strategy gamer: 8.3/10"
7500,seeing all the basement warriors with 1500+ hours makes me reconsider my life decisions
7501,buttery

7526,"WARNING: PC and Mac can no longer play together and there is no workaround for this. If you intend to play singleplayer, get this game it's a lot of fun. If you want to do multiplayer PC to PC or Mac to Mac, get the game. IF YOU INTEND TO DO MAC TO PC MULTIPLAYER DO NOT GET THE GAME IT DOESNT WORK"

7534,"This is one of the best strategy games ever made! At first I was hesitant due to the many changes they made compared to the games prior in the series. However, I've found that they have enhanced the game play for the better. Restricting units to a certain number per hex. Changing the view, enhancing the characteristics of religion and other mechanics. They've done an Amazing job on this game!!"
7535,Highly recommend in my opinion one of the greatest games ever

7547,"This game is a classic at this point. 

I have played through most of the difficulties with more than half of the different civs and everytime, it finds new ways to surprise me. I don't get tired of it and I have a feeling that this is one of the games I will always come back to even in decades from now. 

If you don't already own it, do yourself a favor and buy it."
7548,Civ 5 and chill.

7576,"I have been playing the Civilization games since the first one.  They just keep getting better, keep it coming!  :)
I am not very good, and I usually just prefer to win by domination.  All the extra stuff, culture, religion, ideologies / politics, trade, etc. are also cool but too complex for me to get super involved with them.  That's the beauty of this game though-you can play it however you like.  You can be a bloodthirsty savage like me, or you can be a peace loving, culture-building, foreign relations expert.  Whatever gives you enjoyment.
I will say this:  I can't seem to stop listening to the game music.  I sometimes keep it running while I'm working because it puts me into a trance and boosts my productivity.  My favorite thing to do is get as powerful as possible and surround my enemies and let them grovel and pay me tributes and beg for peace and then wipe them off the face of the planet......lol...yeah, I'm sick....  :)"

7595,"Absolutely love the layout, and the traditional influences in this version of Civilization which I've been playing since the first version of. I'm not a big fan of working on the town zones so much in Civ VI and I really like the oceanography and graphics for CIV V a ton. I wish they would make a new version like CIV V with modern graphics and still keeping the traditional game scheme."

This one was the last of the good decent ones though.  Civ 6 was and still is horrible.  I bought it and erased it and just keep playing Civ V with all the expansions.  I fear what Civ 7 will be.  The developers seem hell bent on making a once great game an ugly pile of garbage."

I remember countless times of staying up until 4 am and not realising. The best thing about it is that you can enjoy this with friends, save your progress and continue on whenever. Would recommend for anyone and everyone."

7655,"Civilization V, developed by Firaxis Games, invites the player to lead and progress a civilization from the stone-age into the future. Winning is determined by achieving one of a number of victory conditions including research, exploration, military conquest as well as a handful of others conditions.

The map itself is procedurally generated, with the game offering map pack and scenario DLC as well as two major expansion packs. Brave New World and Gods & Kings introduce enhanced naval combat and combat AI, new civilizations, international trade routes, world congress and tourism among many other features between the two expansion packs.

While a lot of content and moving pieces to be confronted with, the game guides you through each turn without feeling patronizing. This also means that replayability is not a concern allowing you to crush your opponents time and time again. Genuinely an amazing game; play with friends online or against AI."
7656,I've been playing this game since it was first released years ago and still play it on a daily bases.
7657,game. it is good
7658,I get into moods where I play this game for like 12 hours straight and can't physically stop. It's a really good game for your brain.

7660,yes
7661,"Playing it after playing Civ 6 for months, and I must say Civ 5 still got it. Some people will say that Civ 5 is better then 6 and there are thing that I like better Civ 5 has less religion for starters and units are not giants, but they are to me quite different games as well since Civ 6 introduced some dramatic changes when it comes how you develop your cities (districts vs resources).
Anyhow, Civ 5 is amazing."

7673,it sick
7674,Sublime.
7675,"By now, a classic, chill game. The music is fantastic, the map, great. And unlike it's successor, V leaders' art style makes diplomacy feels more classy, instead of goofy."
7676,Civ V is the goat of civ.
7677,"Its CIV, you can't lose."
7678,The industrial revolution and its consequences have been a disaster for the human race.
7679,"Love this game. I do wish you could augment tiles more to aim of steering enemy sieges, but besides that a very fun civ sim."
7680,I don't even remember playing this.
7681,Its pretty fun
7682,Why is Gandhi nuking me ?
7683,Focus on Science -> Rush Nukes -> Bathe World in Nuclear Hellfire = EZ Win
7684,This game is very good
7685,poggers
7686,"This is my second or third favorite in the series.  I believe Civilization IV to be superior (Also, possibly III but I have not played that title in years).  This game still delivers.  I have logged several hundred hours of playtime on this title.  I do recommend.  I also recommend the series up through this point.  This is the last Civilization game I have purchased or played.  Upon reviews of further titles I am satisfied with this decision.  Sid Meier's Civilization I-V I recommend.  I do feel they reached their peak with numbers III and IV."
7687,9/10
7688,Runs fine on Ubuntu and Opensuse. Only drawback: the map achievements aren't unlocking on linux.
7689,It's like playing Catan by yourself... best game ever!!
7690,50 hours on this account 300 hours on my og account. its a fucking awful game that sucks your life away. atleast its not civ 6.
7691,Life-threatening.
7692,very fun to play with friends and ruin relationships
7693,"Pick venice, standard difficulty (otherwise computer map hacks and also plays kamikrazy), ally with all the city states, rush all wonders, max out trade routes, buy everything and rush to stealth bombers and bomb everyone, pretty fun."
7694,It'addictive. One more turn
7695,really good
7696,It's good I just get bored fast
7697,"as one would expect it is a turn based game with multiple win conditions that are able to be met. i would suggest to obtain the DLC so you are able to get the best experience out of this game. it may seem overly complicated at first, but once you understand the game's economy. you will be able to hold up pretty fair. 

for anyone that does not know, Google Ghandi bug when dealing with him. it was meant to be in the game but be warned. (LOL)

If you are looking for a fast win, spam trading posts and rush a university. these buildings combines along with jungle tiles on the map will produce good gold income as well as science. these are very important for late to end game resources. gold is gold and as you would guess science learns new tech."
7698,"Very fun to play and is addicting, best civilization game in the series in my opinion, 5 out of 5."
7699,Best Game Ever.
7700,fun game
7701,"Amazing interface, beautiful graphics, decent AI"
7702,Decided to take the plunge by ordering a complete physical copy.  People have said Civ V is better for noobs.  I'm enjoying the learning curve and look forward to giving the exploits a go.
7703,fun game
7704,good
7705,Very good play and logic.
7706,Never trust Gandhi.
7707,"Peace was an Option till even fucking Ghandi annihilated me. 
After that, the stability of my state of mind was questionable, as I killed and purged through every single city-state. 
Denaturation wouldnt stop me, as I invented fucking Nukes. So be warned, u are not safe, even if u think so, im gonna purge through these countries and not even women and children will stay in my way. 
Technological Victories are no more and peace will be just an illusion!
"
7708,I like the game but the constant disconnects that my friends constantly get hit with are annoying as hell.
7709,"Great game, a classic."
7710,civ is the kind of game you can spend your life playing!
7711,"Civ 5 is the closest I've come to enjoying board games. It's engaging, fun, and at least the AI doesn't take 2 hours to finish their turn (unlike some of my relatives) :rage_lif: ."
7712,
7713,poland
7714,good
7715,This game will never not be on my list of favourites. I've still got a lot left to do in it after years of playing. There's a reason that I haven't yet moved on to VI. Just one more click...
7716,It's ok I guess
7717,I've never been bored
7718,An absolute masterpiece
7719,good game
7720,"It's my best game.
Civ5's competitor is only Civ6."
7721,"Extremely good, still good, who wants to play? Im competitive :P"
7722,"Super fun game, tons of replayability and great mod support"
7723,Runs smoothly in this MacBook pro mid 2012. Great for history lovers.
7724,"Legendary 4x here. The only horrible thing is how slow bombers move in the late game, so i always change combat to not be animated when they show up in any significant numbers."
7725,cummy goodness
7726,Fun at all difficulties
7727,Hooray for annihilating city states to get easy gold
7728,better than 6
7729,"I will recommend this game because unlike Civilization: Beyond Earth and Civilization 6, it is able to launch on Windows 10, and is able to run for an extended period of time without crashing."
7730,This is by far the best PC game I ever have and ever will have played. Everything about it is perfect. Except for how quickly the A.I. gets it's feelings hurt.
7731,"yes
"
7732,Good
7733,it's perfect
7734,.
7735,funny
7736,"For an older game, I like this version of Civilization the most. I do wish the maps were bigger, but still it is a fun game. What I like is that I am always learning something new, but that isn't saying a lot as I don't have as quick thinking brain as I did when I was younger. For older guys/gals, this could be a lot of fun. Once you play the game on the easiest level, you may find the AI's more difficult as you go into higher levels of play. One thing I do not like is the building of hospitals. In the description of hospitals it says ""It's useful if you want to build a large city fast"", yet it is only available once you reach 740 turns. By then I have already built large cities. There are other such minor issues, but overall a great game."
7737,Its Civ. You know you love it
7738,Conquer. Forgot Diplomacy. England wants you dead no matter what. Aztecs will sneak up on you.
7739,Its CIV...what more to say. I was bad at SidMayers CIV back in 1991 and still did not improve. But I love the game.
7740,good game
7741,Stellaris
7742,world domination a day keep doctor away.
7743,One of the best strategy games of all times.
7744,figured out i was playing the game wrong now it is very good
7745,"gud gaem
"
7746,Best civ imo.
7747,just one more turn.... thats all i want....
7748,"I've had this game for 8 years at this point and I still enjoy how dang pretty this game is. If you love strategy and history you will enjoy the heck out of this game. You can probably get it on sale with the dlc for 20 bucks as well, can't recommend enough!"
7749,good
7750,"It's CIV, you cannot go wrong... well civ 6 is trash but this game is dope"
7751,better than civ 6. ive never played a game like this before but its veryyyyy simple to pick up. and with countless customization combos u can play a new game every time. if this looks hard or intimidating u NEED to give it a shot i swear its really super easy to learn and they give you optional tips along the way.
7752,Why the fuck would you go to an old game and completely change the game mechanics???? They literally took what was AWFUL in Civ6 and retro patched it into Civ 5. Turned one of the best Civ games ever into trash like Civ 6. Wow I wish I could request a refund for this shit.
7753,"best civ game ever
"
7754,It's good
7755,"gotta love having the A.I win games 
"
7756,"Too many gimmicks that shape the play into novelty. Yes, I am comparing it to Civilization III and its glorious days. Bad experience overall. Maybe a great introduction to newcomers."
7757,Great game allround
7758,A ding dang good game
7759,"Follows the civilization franchise, easy control advanced settings for quicker game, lots of dlc and mod add ons"
7760,"good
"
7761,pretty good
7762,yasss gawd good game momma
7763,God Tier
7764,It's pretty alright I guess.
7765,"Its the boom dot.com, classic empire build while choosing how you will develop over time!!!"
7766,"In my opinion better then Civ 6, just because it is so easy to play but hard to master. Its fun with friends or in singleplayer, and few games can match its addictive nature."
7767,Best game to kill time with. Love all the mods too.
7768,Fun to play alone and very fun with friends especially with all the DLC and extra maps.
7769,Brilliant civ game...
7770,"So, I have played Civilization IV, V, VI, and Beyond Earth. Civ V is EASILY the best of those four games (Civ IV is my second favourite given its unique, historical scenarios). I have thrown hundreds of hours into playing, modding, and experimenting with Civ V and it still presents interesting possibilities."
7771,"you get sucked in, its so fun especially with friends to declare war on or work along side each other."
7772,I like civ
7773,classic game
7774,"If you have plans the next day before starting a match. You no longer have those plans, it's 3am, you're not going to bed anymore."
7775,"Still holds up in 2021, can play this game forever it's a masterpiece. The only thing I wish was expanded on was more victory types. My hours on steam should be tripled because I didn't buy it on steam until way later."
7776,thank you dark souls
7777,Better than Civ 6.
7778,All come down to best leader

7782,"Whatever you do....don't utter the phrase ""One more turn and I'm done!"" because it will be an utter lie!"
7783,One...more...turn...
7784,It's a lot like the original but with more detail.
7785,had Fun
7786,"Great Game, a lot of replayability"
7787,alot of fun
7788,quite pog or epic imo
7789,"This is a great game.  I played ver 1 on 3 1/2"" floppies and number of others.  This version is very enjoyable"
7790,Game of champions!
7791,Game is solid for what it offers and if you like strategy games with ancient civilizations this is for you.
7792,Do you want to despise your game? And then immediately fuck everything up with your magnum dong? Civ 5 is for you!
7793,w00t
7794,Too many hours wasted on this. no regrets.
7795,"civ 5 best soo far.
"
7796,Should be classed as a narcotic. Highly addictive.
7797,Classic oldie showing much better polish than some newer games.  Hours of fun and a big mod workshop!
7798,"100% best game in the civilization franchise, offers 100s of hours of gameplay, epic game"
7799,good game
7800,There's a reason this costs more than Civ 6
7801,"Civilization I, II, V, VI best games ever."
7802,Still love this entry.
7803,"This game is an addiction, and one I am happy to continue to feed. By far the most fun I've had with a computer game. This is a form of relaxation for me, I barely even play to win anymore, I just play to experience. Found and build your civilisation, survive against barbarians, confront the Greats of history, and have a good time doing it (even if you didn't end up settling near an iron deposit). This game is perfection."
7804,Great game
7805,Great game better then VI
7806,good
7807,It's nice
7808,I sunk so much time into the Civ series. This one most of all. The hex grid was a great improvement.
7809,a challenge every time
7810,I nuked my friend at the end of our playthrough even though we were allied. 9/10
7811,good game
7812,By far the best version of Civ to date.
7813,decent game
7814,Very fun especially with friends
7815,Great strategy game.
7816,Best time waster out there
7817,Good
7818,"Never have i sucked away more of my life, than playing this game"
7819,2
7820,Great introduction to a great game series!
7821,One... more... turn...
7822,Recommended
7823,Jesus Christ these games take forever but you stay pretty interested in the game the entire play through.
7824,great way to blow a few hours of your life.
7825,"Good time with friends, getting into this you need a friend to run you through the basics to get you started.

Also it really do be like, just one more turn. Then you check the time and it'll be like 3am

Also don't get the base edition, the best way to enjoy the game is with all of the DLC in the complete edition, so that's a bit of a bummer, so it's best to wait for a big sale to get this game (or just get Civ6)"
7826,"Love the gameplay, love the historical characters and love the different victory routes"
7827,I love Civ 5
7828,"Play this instead of 6, Has more engaging aesthetics and doesn't feels as much like a boardgame."
7829,I logged 997 hours on this game at the time of this review. I absolutely love the balance of this game. You win some you lose some against the AI. But when you win you have great satisfaction.
7830,is fum
7831,"Steam support is worthless.  None of the topics work.  I can click until my mouse breaks but nothing opens.  Cant open my Library.  Cant get in touch with steam.  I feel like I've been scammed.  Useless, Useless, Useless"
7832,great:)
7833,good
7834,probably the best civ game
7835,can  pace yourself at what ever pace you choose to go
7836,"I say Civilization V is only ""good"" -- and not ""great,"" as I would have said about Civilization IV -- at crafting stories because I feel like the game's taken away some pretty important tools for customizing your society. In Civilization IV players could force things on their country and opposing nations in the form of religions and government. In Civilization V, though, players gather up ""culture"" as a resource, spending it every so many turns on ""policies"" that give their civilization bonuses. For instance a player might choose to put policy points into the ""Piety"" tree, giving their nation a boost to happiness and forcing them to accept an unnamed religion. I really appreciate the way the various policy trees give players a wide array of customization options for their nation, but I miss the power and ridiculous glee I got out doing things like forcing Judaism down the throats of my enemies because my Jewish Japanese empire was out to win owning the hearts and minds of my neighbors.
"
7837,S'alright
7838,Games a ton of fun!
7839,world go boom
7840,Is good.
7841,
7842,Just one more round...
7843,ye.
7844,Best strategy game on the market!
7845,great addictive game
7846,best fucking game
7847,its good
7848,simple enough to unlike the earlier versions of civilization games
7849,Simple and addictive
7850,"I like the building & planning, strategy"
7851,highly addicting
7852,"The best Civ game. I had over a thousand hours on an old account that I abandoned. I purchased it again for this account because I bought VI and think it's a step backward for the franchise. VI isn't terrible but it isn't amazing, more like they added elements from mobile gaming formats to speed up game play and open up to new users who likely grew up playing strategy games on mobile device. Anyway... In my opinion, Civilization V is one of the best strategy games ever created and easily the best game of the franchise."
7853,"    l tried! Over and over, its there way are the ""Highway"". There one thing I know, you can't do it your way. They made the game to complicated, to many variable, you must follow there path to exceed in a win, from level 4 ""Prince"" and up. You must capture the A.I. City's that attack you in order to start. I'm sorry i'm rambling. Civilization 4 is probably where I need to go, Its rated as the best of the Civilization series. I do not recommend  this game."
7854,">Iroquois have a city named Brantford
>It's too Branty for my liking
>Nuke it into the ground
>Build another city over its ruins
>Name another of my cities Brantford
>Have Iroquois take it from me
>Repeat ad nauseum
10/10 would brantford again"
7855,Relatively complicated turn based game.
7856,very well made
7857,Civ
7858,Bug infested pos wont even go full screen properly old ass game still an unplayable pos so sick of unplayable garbage that doesnt work staying on steam.
7859,me and my son love the game
7860,wird
7861,"no fucking dogshit 
"
7862,"The best of the franchise (including 6). The DLC adds some fun extras to the game (Gods and Kings for religion and Brave New World for culture), but neither are by any means necessary to take you to another level of enjoyment. The base game is good enough. The great thing about this game is that by playing random maps every game feels unique; every game tells its own story. Even to this day I can still remember individual games maps I've played years later. Not many games achieve that.

The only downside to the game is perhaps later on (modern era) where you have to go through the tedium of moving individual units over the map. The larger your army — the more work you have to put into it, but that's a minor criticism. This really is the strategy game that sets the mark, and to my knowledge it remains unsurpassed."
7863,not the most realistic but still one of the best PC grand strategy game. To play and replay enjoying the fun
7864,Well made.
7865,"Love it as much as I love CIv 6. Both different games, both great."
7866,Great game has infinite replayability!
7867,"great game!
"
7868,So like imagine a first person shooter but without the shooter and without the first person and with a head ache
7869,Love exploring
7870,"BEST CIV GAME DONT SAY OTHERWISE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! CIV VI A DUMPSTER FIRE
"
7871,"Best game to lose your friends over!!! It's worth new friends, trust me."
7872,better than civ6
7873,yes
7874,"timeless, endless replayability.  best civ game in my opinion.  nothing but war!"
7875,its kinda fun or whatever
7876,Decent game
7877,Highly recommended.
7878,Its a fun game that you can spend countless hours playing whilst not even realizing that you started at 12 am and its 10 am
7879,*Thumbs up*
7880,"absolutely amazing game, I highly suggest it. Trying to decide between civ 5 and civ 6? go with civ 5, the AI is leagues better and I prefer the gameplay of civ 5 better."
7881,Love this game
7882,The best of the CIV version IMO. I really enjoy this game and will continue to play due to its many variations and options of play. Love it and recommend it.
7883,"I'm old and set in my ways, and I like this one much better than Civ 6. 10/10 would recommend to curmudgeons."
7884,Long games but you want to vanquish your enemy at every cost
7885,Still better then VI
7886,Civ has consumed my soul.
7887,best civ
7888,"Great time killer if you want to pass the time. it can be a battle though the ages or quick domination Victory. would recommend to buy all the DLC on sale if you want, you don't have to. 10/10 If you want to be the next Virtual World Leader"
7889,"One of the best strategic turn based games outs there.
I prefer this over the newer version. 
Every characters has their strengths and weaknesses. 
Once you start a game, 3 hours will fly by like 3 minutes.
If you have time to kill, this game helps you to time warp forward for 6 hours in a blink of an eye."
7890,"Outstanding game, after 2 hours of gathering friends harm can declare war on all of them."
7891,Perfect entertainment
7892,Amazing game

7894,"What's the point of this review? Nobody is going to read it. There are bajillions of these. Stop scrolling and go play something. Also, this game is fun and stuff. And things. I like Civ 5. Bye."
7895,best game ive ever played
7896,great game
7897,Great!
7898,good game
7899,good game. i like it better than vi.
7900,"I've bee playing it for more than 30 years,  since the original version on floppy disks! Never the same game twice,."
7901,One of the greatest strategic game of all time... a bit time consuming though.  I spent hours on this game.
7902,just be hostile to india :))))))
7903,"Originally played the game on my brothers account, highly recommend, though games can be a little long sometimes and addicting..."
7904,I've loved this game for many years!
7905,got it when it was on sale for 93% off for everything and I can say it was def worth it
7906,fun time killer
7907,you already know
7908,yes
7909,"Civ 6 feels wrong.  I'll stick with 5 for all eternity.

All
Of
Eternity.

And I ain't even mad about it.  14 hour Civ5 sessions are great."
7910,I have been playing it on and off for years now. One of the best and most fun strategy games.
7911,Games good.
7912,Great strategy game to pass the time whether you are wasted of cheap beer or seeking a mental challenge for that big brain of yours
7913,very good but now moved to V6
7914,this game isfun
7915,It's never not entertained me. Until endgame. But then just start a new game. Say no to cartoon mobile game graphics!
7916,"Get this game if you are okay with losing a significant amount of your time to just ""one more turn"""
7917,QtWebEngineProcess keeps killing my RAM even when im not playing... killing the process in task manager does jack shit cause it reopens itself everytime. uninstalled cause of this shit
7918,Best strategy city sim of all time IMO.
7919,"Educational and fun - time well-wasted. Thanks for a great platform and attention to detail. Timeless and ageless, gets better as we get on."
7920,awesome game
7921,Would play and play again
7922,it's good
7923,"coooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooom
"
7924,i gave thumbs up but making me comment on it makes me want to change this to thumbs down
7925,I usually get most of my income from trade routes. Either land based or water based. I'm fairly offering other civs their needs and wants and sometime oblige to their demands.. but the moment that they decline my need of Furs will only result into one thing. WAR!
7926,"Is trash
10/10 would recommend"
7927,This is my favorite civ game.
7928,"""Just one more turn"".

Great game.  Very addictive & enjoyable."
7929,One of the best 4X games ever made.
7930,I unfortunately really like this game
7931,gg
7932,It's better then Civ 6 imo.
7933,fun game
7934,i've really love this game :- )
7935,it's good
7936,Easy to get into and challenging as you progress. Choice of leaders and strategy makes for endless possibilities and outcomes. Enjoy!
7937,Ronald Reagan would soychamp over this game.
7938,"It's amazing, so addictive - the perfect turn-based strategy game."
7939,faster then CIV VI
7940,"The game isn't bad, but it does not give me sufficient motivation to play it."
7941,Best strategic game ever
7942,excellent gameplay which make you think
7943,I really like it.
7944,I have enjoyed many civilisation games. This one is one of my favourite of the franchise.
7945,Thanks for getting it so right that I have no desire to buy the new game. Saves me money!
7946,You'll lose days but gain centuries.
7947,"i have a ""special interest"" in these games. played alot of civ5 from release on my old account so thats where the majority of my hours lie, i honestly used to like this game quite a bit...but the more you play it the more you see how 1UPT isnt implemented well and how the AI cant handle this change at all, ive never ever played a game of civ5 or even 6 that doesnt have traffic jams that get worse as you get further in. i know theres been much discussion of this change since 2010 and i dont care to contribute much past that and like, tom chick's excellent review of the game, so ill get to the point. i dont play civ to play like some board game simulation, i play it for the narrative...i play it cuz i want to build an empire that stands the test of time! civ5 doesnt really want you to build much of an empire, in fact, it penalizes you for doing so...global happiness, nerfed tile yields, maintenance costs discouraging development...4 city tradition is basically always the way to go. i remember a release G&K MP game i played ended early cuz one of the players bankrupted themselves by building too many housings and had to forfeit...lol. the thing thats so bizarre about this stuf to me is, its all this ideological debate about a problem of ""tall"" vs ""wide"" that simply does not exist in the civ4 system, so instead we simply regress to the spectre of civ3 corruption, that failed mechanic, with global happiness system. in civ4 happiness is per city and expansion is limited cuz cities dont pay for themselves without improvement, meaning as the game goes on empires will naturally begin to sprawl as they can afford to...its an elegant fix, which even civ6 partially agrees with. the typical other complaints also exist; civ4's AI is pretty crafty, it cant do sea invasions but they rarely can, civ5's AI acts arbitrarily like dogs, they hate you for everything, and then they all war you when you come close to winning like civ3 days. its fine and all but again, im playing this to build an empire, not be reminded that im in videogame land when every leader shows up to call me an asshole shitbrain in a row. in civ4 religion tended to be very decisive, power blocs tended to form along religious lines and ur decisions in spreading a religion or embracing one could prove to matter very late in the game, or early if u got fucked by the AP garharhar...ive had many games of civ5 where religion is a total non-factor, and it shouldnt be! diplomacy is simply lesser...u cant ask leaders u have trust with what they think of others anymore, theres no vassal states, and crucially no tech trading. one of the few material incentives u have for cooperating with others, it allows smaller civs to play catch up, it solidifies alliances, its all around a good addition. this isnt a discussion of whether or not civ5 is dumbed down compared to 4, because i simply think civ5 is a new design, its the civ1 to civ6's civ2, i just dont happen to particularly like it....ultimately alot of the changes are a reaction to the imagined problem of ""tall"" vs ""wide"" solved in civ4. now ill go on doing my gay little activities and laughing to myself ^_^"
7948,Best game out there. Could use new civs and characters but always an adventure.
7949,Civ V is fun.
7950,2021 still playing
7951,gg
7952,this game fuckin sucks like wtf? looking at a map all day like grow up bro. not even historically accurate i was playing and someone built the pyramids in like 1100 as if theyu think their playerbase is retarded enough to not know they were built in like 500 bc. and who the fuck is sid meier anyway??? he's not even in the game. absolute ripoff pos game no thanks.
7953,yeah
7954,"Great game, highly addictive. Great for multiplayer because the AI is unreasonably dumb. The Vox Populi mod helps, but even then the AI is still child's play. Get all the DLCs, because the game is better balanced with all of the features."
7955,"The best game in the series in my opinion.

Not perfect, but as close as the series can get! (specially if you can get some mods into it like ""Vox Populi"")"
7956,Best CIV game out there
7957,Civ 5 is much better than Civ 6
7958,39 hours and i've played three times. buy it. do it now.
7959,very nice
7960,"Don't run on windows 10 

เล่นไม่ได้บนวินโด 10"
7961,"better than civ 6 in a number of way in which we find graphism, gameplay ,balance , I.A. difficulty...."
7962,h
7963,Very fun 10/10
7964,your capitol are belong to us
7965,its ok
7966,it's ok i guess
7967,"super fun game, best in the bunch!"
7968,woot woot.
7969,"civ v best civ, Korea DLC was like £1.99. Much better than civ 6"
7970,Waste of time.
7971,Played Ghandi nuked the world peacefully 10/10
7972,this is a good game
7973,realy time comsuming for empier likers

7975,nuked an army who use bow and arrow
7976,Its pretty good
7977,"very good yessir

7978,Very fun game when having some great time to spend
7979,hoi
7980,Civilization Babyyyyyyyyy
7981,It is fun.
7982,good
7983,i like it
7984,nukes are the best diplomatic option
7985,"The absolute peak of turnbased strategy games, it is to games what I am to humanity."
7986,very engaging.  You get sucked in - and time flies by
7987,"I can't stop playing! You would think that doing similar things over and over would get old, but it hasn't. I have been working towards all the hundreds of achievements which requires a lot of thought to win a certain way and play many different civilizations. I already bought Civ 6, but I don't want to play it until I play out the old one!"
7988,good
7989,Still my favoite civ game out of all of them
7990,one more turn... just one more
7991,"really good game 
"
7992,Awesome
7993,goood
7994,its good. get it. do it. yeah you. just do it.
7995,"Sid Meier's Civilization V involves you playing as a certain civilization and building it up through the expansion of your borders as well as soft and hard power. 

Civ V is definitely recommended for those who are into strategy games. If you are looking to get into strategy games, I highly recommend Civ V as a great starting point. It's very filled to the brim with hundreds of hours of content from the different civilizations to different maps to different ways of achieving ultimate victory. This game can best be described as addicting. When you finish a turn, you have the overwhelming urge to just go for another turn because of how Civ V is able to draw players in with that sense of adventure and challenge to develop their civilization the way they want to."
7996,"Very addicting, better flow and game play then the newer Civ 6"
7997,"When loading into any multiplayer game after saving, it freezes. No way around it. They won't fix it."
7998,"The embellishments with religion, diplomacy, and factions that quite literally appear outside your cities if you can;t figure out how to make the citizens happy with trade and luxury... If the rampaging rivals, barbarians, and enemies even on Chieftan mode (simple easy mode) which come at you in force even when rampaging is turned off in custom worlds...

The game is messy and overly bloated compared to the classic Civ2/3... I understand enhancements and depth are a goal here, but having to switch to BEGINNER gameplay to figure out how to work trade and diplomacy before your own rebelling citizens take up arms or the barbarians wipe your cities off the map...  is sad."
7999,I have been playing this game for years. By far a must for any Government Major or Political Science major. Fun to play out stuff you learned in college.
8000,The Vox Populi (Community Patch Project) mod makes this a far better game than Civ VI.
8001,"As easy or difficult as you want.  Great game with a multitude of strategies and options along the way.  Ultimately, a war game for all players."
8002,I finally broke 1000 hours in the game... and I now feel l am qualified to comment..... ITS AWESOME! This is hands down the BEST civ game that has ever come out. I own and play all the Sid Meier civ games.... and this one is definitely my favorite. And the mod options are crazy. Lots of hours of fun... get as in depth as you want in culture and diplomacy and spend weeks playing through one game.... or go for ultimate power and destroy the world with nukes and beat everyone in one session.... the choices are endless.
8003,This shit slaps
8004,Better than VI still
8005,"Great stepping stone into the world of grand strategy games. 

Also really fun (and easy) to play with friends."
8006,great game
8007,It's alright
8008,"The game is awesome for it's diversity. It is not just another war game where you only build an army from a list of a selection of 3 of 4 races or nations and go fight.  1st you have a selection of about 40 + civilizations to choose from. From there when you are building your civilization and army you have to keep them happy because an unhappy nation can actually revolt  and some cities have riots ( barbarians rise up and fight  from within your borders) and even leave your nation. you also have the many different ways you can win a Military victory (dominance) as usual or you have things like a cultural victory, science victory and you can  actually be voted as the victor by the other civilizations (world leader). And although it is not a victory condition ,religion plays a very important role in the can and you have more than a few to choose from and fight over ( I have a bad habit of fighting a lot of my wars simply over keeping my religion dominant ). I should mention that all  the different civilizations have their own special strengths and weakness so when you choose a different one it is not just a different color army on the map it is actually a little different overall. I could go on about this game for awhile but this was a good start. the only thing I don't like is it keeps track of the time you have it on and if you are like me I leave it running when i get up to eat, go to the bathroom, watch news, I even have the bad habit of stopping and watching a movie if a good one is on when I walk by the tv. So actually I am not on nearly as long as it thinks I am, it just looks like I live on it. LOL that is the only bad thing at all that I have to say about it. It is a great game. Enjoy."
8009,Brill Game
8010,IT TAKES TIME AND INTELLIGENCE TO OUTSMART THE COMPUTER  ON HIGHER LEVEL SETTINGS. QUITE CHALLENGING
8011,"best turn-based strategy game. You can mod it to get more content, even fantasy scenarios exist. Multyplayer is much fun with friends."
8012,The game keeps crashing. So annoying
8013,"So Civ IV I personally have something of a problem with. What I like about Civ IV, III does better. What I prefer about Civ IV to III, V does better. Civ IV is widely renowned as the best, but the problem is it combines the worst of both. I love III. So far I can see myself falling DEEPLY in love with V. IV is dead to me now."
8014,very fun
8015,"Its fun!
"
8016,really easy to get lost with time and keep clicking next turn
8017,Stole my youth
8018,absolutely the best game of all time.
8019,Just play it. Rule the world.
8020,a classic yet incredibly fun distraction from my crippling depression
8021,"Great Game. Good planning with good strategic, sometimes need a bit of luck too."
8022,is gud gam
8023,Better than Civ 6.
8024,"This game is a trap I have actually put almost 29 hours into it within 48 hours/2 days of playing it again. I downloaded it played all day stayed up till 5 A.M slept only till like 10 A.M and played for another 12 hours or longer. Idk what my life has become but my family isn't proud of me. This game is fun af though, I played it like in 2016 a little bit trying to nostalgia grab Civ Revolution from the Xbox 360 and didn't get hooked, came back a couple days ago and now I'm an addict. Game is pretty overwhelming at first, I'm pretty nooby at strategy games, but this game being turn based at least offline you can pace yourself and really learn the ropes with the lower difficulty AI. The game has so many different map options/customization it is unreal. The only complaint I really have is the fog wall sometimes just boxes out and glitches over the screen and stuff doesn't load right. But nothing that saving and reloading didn't fix."
8025,Pretty civilized tbh
8026,It really slaps
8027,This game is so good you will spend an inordinate amount of time playing. Be careful.
8028,good
8029,"If you buy this game you will be forced to buy the DLC.

There are game breaking bugs in it that are only fixed by buying the DLC.

This used to be a good franchise, not anymore."
8030,Nuke go BOOOOOM
8031,Best Civ game in the franchise. The art is the most realistic. It is the most user friendly and intuitive. The UI is the most comfortable to use. And the mods and add on DLC content is the best of the entire series. Gods I hate Civ Vi.
8032,What's to say that already hasn't been. The game sucks hours out of you and you wouldn't want it any other way.
8033,"The only game where i'll start playing at 4:00pm, and the next time i look at the clock its 3:00am."
8034,"Civilization V is THE BEST strategy game in my eyes. as a player who has over 1,000 hours into it and has all the DLC and Map Packs for it. I consider this version better than Civilization VI. Next to the Total War Series and Hearts of Iron 4. you won't be disappointed. I promise you.  I sometimes spend MONTHS on end on one scenario. TIME will be endless if your are not careful while playing. I would recommend getting ALL the expansions and map packs for it because you can't play Civ 5 Vanilla without the additional content. if you are you are missing out on crucial content that is VITAL to  gameplay (Culture, Trade, technologies, maps, more Civs, and of course ideologies). so delve yourself into it and only take one more turn but if your not careful 30 minutes can turn into a 12 hour session. You've been warned."
8035,I love the late game cause it reminds me of what war game red dragon could have been; a good game
8036,i love the civ games fun turn based game play.
8037,This game will suck the life out of you but FUCK it is fun. Multiplayer across the pond is shit
8038,"Game crashes every 20 minutes. It literally crashed 4 times in the last 1 hour 20 minutes I played. I'm using the Steam Linux Runtime, so this game should be supported under Linux.
It's a shame too, since this game is better than the VI in my opinion."
8039,Great on my older computer since my newer computer was stolen...mp has cheaters though i play the computer mostly.
8040,Just won my first game
8041,"Don't buy this game if you have other stuff to do. 

Hands down my favorite strategy game."
8042,"This is a wonderful turn based strategy game, and I think it knocks the socks off of Civilization 6. This game has a very large amount of content as well as so many different ways to play the game. The only downside to this game is that the DLC packs are quite necessary in my opinion as they contain tons more content than the base game alone."
8043,"great strategy game lots to track and build
"
8044,not much to do
8045,Best turned based strategy game out there
8046,"Solid game, good strategy, better with friends who are assholes and will turn on each other"
8047,It's alright.
8048,THE BARBARIAN KEEPS STEALING WORKER
8049,fun

8051,"This is the Zenith of the Sid Meier Chronology.

I happily await the day it is usurped . . . by Civ 7.
:)"
8052,If you need something to burn days away to merely reset when a fight slightly tilts in the enemy's favor. This is the game for you.
8053,aw heck yeah
8054,good
8055,.
8056,A great value at this point (with the expansions).  A lot of things to try in the game.
8057,Doesn't crash randomly 10/10
8058,"I have conquered the world. I've obliterated all nations and uncovered the world map in its entirety. I have met every possible victory condition and am currently on turn 300-something. Why, you ask? I just want to see how long I can go before the game forces me to stop. At this point I'm not at all certain it will."
8059,"It certainly has entertained me for several years.  Easy to play and setup, and the graphics are great."
8060,10/10
8061,I just barely got the hang of it and it only took me a few hours.
8062,"yens tis a pogers game ngl its fun

gandhi is a true nuke boi"
8063,"fun classic game, took me some getting use to as it's my first 4X game but i would recommend this to anyone who enjoy strategy games. Although i'm not good at RTS's i do enjoy playing them for fun, SC 2 being one of my favourite games for the campaign mode. I also play a lot of AOE with my friends although i'm not much competition. With games like Civilization i have time to think and act and plan my moves and build my civ to my liking and win my way. I'm not forced to victory with domination, i can go the political route, science route. I'd suggest this to anyone whose not so good with RTS's but still enjoys them."
8064,Muchos fun
8065,It's an awesome trip through history
8066,its great
8067,better than civ 6
8068,"I still like Civ 5 in 2021, despite that it's quite old game, I do not like religious addons, neither Civ 6.
Recently tried Old World, that looks similar to Civ 5, but it has too much strange features. So Civ 5 base is still the best!"
8069,Can absorb time like a black hole... great game.
8070,My life is dying
8071,"hey
"
8072,By far my favorite strategy game of all time.
8073,gg
8074,This is what I consider the best Civ game ever made. Civ VI is good but this game is addicting.
8075,fun way to spend some off time
8076,penis
8077,I love the game. Its very interactive and once you get the hang of it its pretty easy to play.
8078,games fucking lit
8079,Please describe what you liked or disliked about this product.
8080,Its okay i guess
8081,fffffffff
8082,One of my favorite games of all time.
8083,Good game
8084,Let's you establish a NWO with friends.
8085,This game has taught me the valuable lesson. I should never enter politics. Too much fun!
8086,"It's a very good game, sometimes it can even get addicting.

If you haven't played, I STRONGLY suggest you give it a try."
8087,"Civ games are, across the board, amazingly fun to play (though time consuming). To anyone who likes strategy games, whether as board or video games, I highly recommend Civ 5!"
8088,yes
8089,Good.
8090,Best balanced intro to grand strategy you'll find
8091,very Involving and always a new game
8092,"Better than 6, probably in my top 5 strategy games of all time. The one more turn phrase rings true in Civ V."
8093,"I hated this one for years, but I gotta say its pretty fun."
8094,Big fun
8095,"My entry point to the civ series, what a game bruh. I spent hours and hours playing this with mates and it is great everytime. I prefer some of the mechanics in this game rather than civ 6 tbh and since its a lot cheaper I would probably recommend this one over the new. If you're interested in 4X games with a lot of strategy and nuance then this is a awesome starting point.

Brave new world is a must tho so get that if you can"
8096,good time passer
8097,Addicting but challenging
8098,Fun Game!
8099,it fun
8100,This is a great turn-based game that can be as simple or complex as you like.
8101,fun
8102,"Civ fan since the original in the early 90's.  Civ5 is the best of the modern games because it's immersive but doesn't feel like work.  Civ6 looks nicer but there's so much going on (specifically the addition of religions, the civics tree, and city unstacking), for me it just feels like work.  Civ5 is a much more enjoyable way to waste a few hours!"
8103,very yes gud gem
8104,Incredible and diverse gameplay
8105,"This game is like being given a massive bag of coke. Sure you could just do a line or two, but you end up doing way more than you should."
8106,great turn-based strategy game. fantastic to play alone or in groups of friends while you all hang out.
8107,It's just sort of adequate.
8108,good game
8109,Fun for the whole family.
8110,GOOD
8111,Cool
8112,I like it more than 6
8113,wery gud
8114,yes
8115,Bassically Heroin
8116,"it as good as you put the effort in play any game...do you have what it takes rule...
"
8117,Pretty good game!
8118,23.6 hours to complete 1 game. 100% worth
8119,Great game
8120,Yes
8121,If you want a game you can walk away from if need be this is a good one
8122,"11 years later and this is still the best civ game. You should definitely buy this instead of Civilization VI.

ps. I recommend you to buy it with all the dlcs."
8123,I didn't even know I had this many hours in this game.
8124,"One of the greatest games I've played both by myself and against friends, an rts that sticks true to providing a great experience for the player and fulfilling game play if you enjoy strategy games."
8125,"An almost perfect balance of strategy and visual flair, this has used up more of my life than ,y life should have!"
8126,yes good okay
8127,"Never will be another game like it.

Tried Civ 6, and had a mid-twenties crisis. The world just isn't the same anymore."
8128,"After 2200 hours of my life going into this game i have to say i love it, cant lie on that. I have tried to play Civ 6 several times and its like rubbing my sack with a cactus. I hate it. Mods alone give Civ 5 so much life on an already excellent base game. Today i am uninstalling it however because i am tired of getting the next button glitch. Yes i am aware of the autosave feature but playing on epic mid game is a slow grind and every turn is a good 10 - 15 minutes to do everything possible to get an advantage over the other computer players. That being said, i deem it unplayable because of that. Its been real Civ but i am tired of starting awesome games and then getting caught on a stupid bug and having to reload several turns back. I could just save every turn but i shouldn't have to do that ."
8129,x
8130,Vox Populi for Civ V remains the best strategy computer game. Nothing else has even come close.
8131,It’s aight
8132,Great game
8133,"As a war game, Civ V is compelling and engaging. I find the peaceful means of victory a bit opaque however. Still, the exploration is fun.  On the other other hand, one does question the way the game determines who is civilized. While it nods to multi-culturalism, there is clearly a European lens through which we see the game."
8134,"bought this and its DLC when it was on sale for 95% couple years ago, feels bad I didnt start playing then."
8135,"I normally don't care for games like these, but idk Civ V hits different."
8136,"Great Game,but multiplayer is wonky with desync and corrupted saves"
8137,Better than Age Of Empires II
8138,"Thanks, Sid Meier!"
8139,"One of my favorite games!
"
8140,"A great game. With all the DLC, it's an amazing experience. Plenty of cool mods. It holds up very well compared to Civ VI. If you like 4x games, you'll love it. If it's on sale, don't hesitate to get it."
8141,"Fun, challenging mechanics of a large variety of difficulties. 10/10"
8142,i luv this
8143, veri fann gaym and veri nice
8144,"It is inmersive, and you can get carried away."
8145,best civ game in my opinion.
8146,It's like a chess game but alone.
8147,I'm still not so sure what I'm doing. I'm legit just that dude who helps his friends with resources and nothing more
8148,vd

8152,ye
8153,iTS CIV YOU KNOW THE DEAL
8154,"Excellent game, minus how long it takes to load. After this, I have a hard time going back to earlier entries in the series."
8155,One of the greatest PC games ever. A true classic.
8156,"Timeless game being playing every now and again for years, nothing like it."
8157,Just one more turn......
8158,Got bored after 1000 hours
8159," do you value your free time?
no
well this is the game for you!
Hours, Days, Years, Centuries will pass and you'll still be saying just one more hour!"
8160,i wish i could stop playing this game
8161,still holds up
8162,Very addictive.
8163,always fun with try hards
8164,Golden classic
8165,Nice game Civ VI is also fun
8166,would fight warmonger Ghandi again.
8167,in this dimension 5>6
8168,Well balanced and fun game. One of the best Civ Games.
8169,"Excellent and fun edition of this franchise. While I love VI, I still find myself preferring V for the superb graphics and its simplicity."
8170,pretty fun man
8171,"Better than Civ VI, bit glitchy sometimes"
8172,"it is gud
"
8173,"I have no doubts that this is the best entry in the Civilization series (6 has been released at the time of writing). That being said, this game is heavily contingent on key expansions in order to be a complete experience, and even then the balance and pacing of the game is completely off.

Now, in 2021, the game has been heavily visited and re-visited by a highly proactive modding community who have attempted time and time again to ""fix"" the game in a competitive sense to make it more engaging. I deeply respect the efforts of those who worked on this project, basically doing unpaid labor for the original developers. That being said, the result of their project- to me anyway- was the revelation that the game was simply unsalvageable.

The game takes forever to play, even on a fast pace. This wouldn't be a problem if it weren't for the fact that the match is decided relatively definitively by a few small details, and the vast majority of this time is spent on busywork and tedious micromanagement contingent on uninteresting game knowledge which must be painstakingly built up over a long period of time, sapping the critical decision making process out of the game. This issue is compounded by the fact that the spectrum of different skills among players is so massive as to sour the experience for matches among friends who haven't already sunk many days of their life learning and practicing.

The singleplayer experience is not fun at all. The AI, even on the hardest difficulty, is ludicrously easy to beat and never produces interesting situations. It might be good for a power trip, but that's about it."
8174,World domination is fun
8175,"""ребята, я через науку, если кто-то нападёт - я ливну"""
8176,Nice game (with DLC's)
8177,This game with Vox Populi is the greatest 4x ever made
8178,It's alright.
8179,"I have never once played this online, never played with dlc, and have almost 200 hours. This shit is the greatest strat game of all time, civ6 can suck my balls."
8180,Sid Meier's Civilization V
8181,"Civilization V is my (and many others) introduction into turn-based strategy games. Any time I want to sink hours into a game, Civ V is always the first game that comes to mind. I don't really play solo (I did for a period of time attempting to get achievements), but the multiplayer experience is top notch.

Since its release, my brother and I have always played the game the same exact way: Marathon on the largest map possible with as many civilizations and city-states available. Dependent on our mood, we'll either choose our civilization or play random. Each game takes a day to complete, and then we'll start another shortly after. Granted, we only ever do this on holiday breaks.

Since I've grown older and haven't had the time to waste a day playing a game, I haven't really come back to Civ V. Whenever my brother and I do play though, it's entirely worth the time sink."
8182,i love this game! super fun and nostalgic :)
8183,"Want to waste 12 hours of your life to meticulous strategy and turn based madness? Do you like math? Well this game is perfect for you. Find the ways to break the game as fast as possible, and watch your civilization annihilate the rest of humanity, or become a pacifist hell-bent on scientific advancement. Either way you win. The only flaw in this game is how unbalanced the Civs are. However, this makes it much more challenging and even unfair on higher difficulties."
8184,good
8185,it's pretty sick
8186,Nice
8187,"there's you and then there's this map, and you try to steal the map. good game."
8188,dus is gooden ja
8189,very detailed and comprehensive game.  I enjoy some of the subtle touches as much as the gameplay.  The music is amazing!!
8190,It's playable
8191,"I do not show a LIBRARY once I Iog in. I figuered out I would go  around that concern by going to the problem of having a problem playing my game then choosing the view in library mode, (that didn't work), so I went to show in store. I found out there that the game was loaded into my LIBRARY, then fit the green button,(which didn't work), so I hit the PLAY NOW button, and that didn't work."
8192,"Hm?
You're asking me to ""write"" a review Steam, when I just want to recommend this game publicly?
Well, here is your ""review"":

10/10"
8193,"This game is incredibly addictive, and for some reason, I prefer Civ 5 to Civ 6. Perhaps because I've put so many hours into Civ 5, I need to put more time into Civ 6 to get the new gameplay down. Great game to pick up and play for a few min and then save and come back to when you have the time."
8194,have sex with me pls
8195,yes just makes sense. PERFECT
8196,5/5
8197,Altijd spannend
8198,Why'd you fatheads lock my video game behind a non-optional 'beta' launcher?
8199,"One of the greatest video games ever made. Don't bother with Civ 6, this game can be played in another 10 years and still be considered ahead of its time. 10/10."
8200,the next turn button makes you time travel into the future
8201,"Absolutely terrific game, which brought the Civilization series forward with things like hexagonal tiles, better resource management and ideologies. The game is great in its unmodded state, but I highly recommend playing it with the excellent Vox Populi modpack, which improves just about every aspect of it."
8202,I've been playing this game since Civ 2. It's lovely. So many ways to play whether you're bloodthirsty or artistic or scientific.
8203,"I cannot really line it up in pro and con, I enjoy the civilization series for the type of game it is, part historic in terms of the quotes and discoveries tech, good strategy in combat options (use terrain to your best along with ranged) and a bit of sim city building where you expand your territory with each city you found. Mix in with some diplomatic options and you got a great game series. I have played each one over the years and keep going back to play them again, even the very first one."
8204,eh
8205,amazing game

8211,"I'm not one for strategy games, but once I really started to sink my teeth into this game, I had an absolute blast with it. I wish the victory conditions were a little more balanced (looking at you, science), and I wish I had more friends would would play with me. After a while, negotiating with AI gets to be pretty stale. Doing so with actual people would add a whole new dimension to this game. Friends or not, this is still definitely worth you time. 

Make sure to buy the complete edition on sale!"

8233,Gandhi nuked me. I recommend this game.

8242,addicting
8243,"Addictive. Always ""just one more turn..."""
8244,"You will not enjoy, especially if you are a fan! 
This is the least balanced game in existence, you are limited to 2 or max 3 cities if you want to win (unbalanced unhappiness from the number of cities, because we all really want to only play with 2 cities and wank off with barbs), and only certain leaders give you a fighting chance. Of course developers of this utter garbage preferred to add even less balanced leaders and make barbarians super annoying rather than focusing on increasing city limit and balancing leaders. Firaxis, your design and product management team is utter garbage, proven by every game being worse than the last, the fact that you pay still them astounds me!"
8245,needs more trans representation but overall good game
8246,so many mods so many hours to play
8247,Just finished my first game. I couldn't recommend it more than it already is.
8248,buy
8249,super fun
8250,Probably the best Civilization game ever made in all of time in both the past and the future.  10/9  great game.
8251,"its fun
"
8252,So much fun!
8253,"A fantastic strategy game, a classic on the level of Heroes III.

All of the moving parts can take a bit of time to wrap your mind around on harder difficulties, once the AI actually starts being a pain (just got my ass handed to me by a combined war from the Iroquois and the Aztecs), but it's so worth it.

Dreadfully easy to lose hours in this game."
8254,"For me, this (V BNW) is the pick of the Civilization games. Unlike IV, ranged attacks are really ranged - as in, archers don't run up and try to stab enemies with their arrows. Combat in V is just better than in IV. Period. And as for VI, ah, I can't stand it. Unfortunately it looks as though the team behind VI will stay for VII, which is for me a terrible shame. The V BNW team should pick up from where they left off, imo."
8255,this is the best strategy game ever!!!
8256,"The game was in a terrible state at release, with core mechanics that were completely imbalanced relative to each other (and let's not get into balance between leaders).

It became okayish but very shallow with the complete overhaul that followed John Shaeffer's firing. Only with the frist extension, Gods and Kings, does it become a complete game - even though post-renaissance is still somewhat bland.

With the second extension, Brave New World, the game gains depth across all eras, and some new leaders have radically different mechanics worth trying out.

For historically-minded people, some of the solo campaigns are absolutely worth checking out (Genghis Khan and Into the Renaissance come to mind)."
8257,"I didn't understand why everyone liked this game so much until I started playing, and now you have to pry it out of my hands for me to stop 

11/10 would recommend"
8258,Awesome strategy game
8259,The best in the series a good in between of the classic roots of the series and the modern elements. Good cast of leaders good mod support

8261,This is the best Civ game.
8262,good stuff
8263,"Buen juego de estrategia, entretenido. No difiere mucho de otros como Age of Empire, solo tiene mejor gráfica."
8264,"I just finished my first game and.... this is one of the best strategy games i have ever played. It never feels boring and the warfare is fun. I would recommend this game to anybody who likes strategy or board games. Now if you would excuse me, I am going to go start a new game."
8265,yes
8266,"Not sure if I've put in enough hours to fully judge the game, but so far it's pretty good."
8267, as it was originally great up dates cause problems
8268,"Dudes...I've played this game for years. It's loads of fun even if you can not play solo like in Civ4. I do miss that. Great animations, awesome world wonders, super fun."
8269,is good
8270,NUKE GHANDI = WORLD PEACE
8271,"Just sold opium to Isabelle from animal crossing, then helped the Ottoman Empire liberate Zootopia from Midna and Celestia. in the same turn. Civ6 wishes it had a modding community this good"
8272,"Sid Meier's Civilization V can be the make or break with friendships so be warned. Friends can quickly turn into enemies in an instant so you need to be kept on your toes at all times. This turn based strategy game is an absolute gem of a game and with the amount of leaders that are provided in this game means that each playthrough can have its own unique twist and provide endless amounts of fun.

AI or against other players, this game will annoy you (but in a good way) as you try and reach victory against the other leaders. Would definitely recommend picking this game up if you see it on a good sale!"
8273,Get out while you can.
8274,amazing
8275,yes
8276,"Looks good and it's fun, especially with friends. What else can i say?"
8277,.
8278,This game has ruined my life and friendships
8279,"Civilization is a game that I really want to like. It can absorb the player for hours. But that's a testament to game design being directed toward addictive game mechanics more so than improvements. It's always been a mash of mechanics meant to provide game play option that don't play well with each other. Civilization hasn't improved it's core concepts much at all since it used a checker board grid. The developer seems so intent on adding bells and whistles to market a new version that it never addresses the games true flaws. Stupid stacking rules, board game mentality resource management, game mechanics that make no sense, diplomacy that pretends it doesn't always degenerate toward conflict, and an interface that encourages micro management, hence the long play times. The game doesn't need the modding community that makes the game playable, it needs a complete overhaul."
8280,good
8281,If you like strategy games Civilization is the best game made.  It is as easy as that.
8282,"Peak Civ.

The complete edition of this game alone is enough for an irl culture victory.

8292,"best series ever.
"
8293,"Aaah, Civilization V, one of the best strategic games that you get so into it and want to reach the next eras and techonology but at the same time it is not tiring. Sometimes I can play for the whole day without even realising and sometimes I just want to talk it slow and enjoy my ran through the week. The different civilizations and their unique attributes gives the players so many options and fun ways to play the game. Overall, it is an amazing game that makes you relax and let's you play at your own pace. Would 100% recommend."
8294,Give fun for a time
8295,"In my opinion Civ 5 is a Steam mainstay. This is a game that I can consistently come back to and have a good time. It's not the most in-depth civilization management game, but I think that works to its benefit. It's very approachable, and yet there's a lot of nuance for those who decide to look for it. Easy 9.5/10, has some bizarre online issues and occasionally some single player visual bugs."
8296,"very fun, runs amazing on an off the shelf i5!"
8297,Pro
8298,Awesome game. I love it! 8/10
8299,"I got into Civilization on the 2nd reiteration of the game, and then I completely forgot about it. The only thing I remembered about Civ was the cool music (Crusades from Civ 2 still plays in my head from time to time). Currently playing Civ 6 but I came back to review this game to let people know that if you want to jump into Civ, Civ 5 is perfect. Really the only complaint I have about this game is the AI sucks, but they improve on this vastly in 6. Definitely recommend."

8309,"Great strategy game. The saying ""just one more turn..."" holds true."
8310,Hell yeah
8311,"I have been playing this game for several years.
I really like the early stages of the game but as it goes on it can be a drag.
It seems that I am always trying to keep my citizens happy and its really no fun unless you are at war.
I think that the maps could be larger with the possibility of combining troops for an army vs individual units.
The cities are two small scale wise. 
That said, I still very much like this game."

8346,any game where you can destroy the american empire with spearmen as polynesia is a good game in my book

8349,no
8350,"It's Civilization. If you don't know by now what to expect, look up any of the previous games. The details may change, some gameplay elements, the Civ in each games may change too but at the end of the day, it's always the same foundation and overall quality we have learned to expect from this series."

8361,I get to invade my friend Gabe's puny empire.
8362,Fun to play and easy to learn.
8363,Better than Civlization 6
8364,"Civ is one of those games similar to Monopoly that people love and keep playing even though its almost objectively poorly designed.  The xpacs really showed it's true colors;  they didn't attempt to balance things or add more flavor, they just heaped a bunch of new meaningless systems and complexity onto it.  Trade routes, spies, religious influence, international assemblies with delegations....all this crap just makes my head hurt and makes the gameplay muddy and ambiguous.  After the novelty wears off, it's a real slog, even on the lightest settings.

After hundreds of hours on it, I'm uninstalling and not looking back.  The grindy, grindy pace of the game and the arbitrarily dense mechanics outweigh the feeling of exploration, growth, and conquest.  And it has no business running as wonkily as it does on modern systems given how old it is."
8365,Civ 5 is fantastic.  Always a classic
8366,very good
8367,yay
8368,"Awsome game bit outdated, I'd recomend catching CIV 6  on sale as Its been out for awhile and goes on sale quite a bit. If you want to start the CIV games its a good way to start"

8381,Novus Ordo Seclorum
8382,Recently bought this game because i heard great things. Played for 2 hours but now the game crashes after the opening cinematic.  I have a brand new PC with a 3070.  After several re installs and even trying some work arounds i saw online(this appears to be a pretty big problem) nothing works.  I guess ill try and get a refund.  Disappointing though because i was really enjoying the game.
8383,Its a great game for lovers of strategy and history
8384,Very Yes
8385,Still the best in the series for me.
8386,is pretty good
8387,"This game is so simplified that it's sad. For people who used to play the versions before Civ5 this one is a sad joke. The tech tree is very simple no interesting changes, no going a specific way to achieve a different type of victory earlier in game. The tech tree ends with two future military units and that is all. The game plan at the end is always the same. 
Tech atomic bomb is a joke. Back in old Civ games atomic bombs used to make polution which could not be fixed and therefore nuking a city was really painful. Now if my 10 cities get's nuked I just send workers and 10 turns later no difference for my civilization. 
The only interesting part is religion and ideology but then again there are no side effects which makes it's easy to use. 

Overall this game was created for rather young people and normal players have nothing to do with this title but to beat it high difficult and uninstall."
8388,Classic and Playable
8389,it's ight
8390,"always enjoy the simplicity yet strategic process that the game has. 
"
8391,"I love this game, love this series, and will continue to play as it moves forward. 

But I must retire Civ V. I now cannot play without crashes, which never used to happen. Now I can't even get to Industrialization. Very disappointing. I will miss it, but I'm retiring V until bugs are tweaked."
8392,"I really like this game, it fun and the in game mechanics works as intended. Me and my friends have however run into a few problems, but this is nothing game breaking, more like a work-around thing.

So if you are bored and is looking to spend 60+ hours on ONE match, this is the game for... I would recommend you bring an experienced friend, as it can be quite confusing at first."
8393,ITS FUN
8394, awesome game. better than civ 6 by far
8395,yes
8396,"While Sid Meier's Civ VI has been out for awhile now, Civ V is still a great experience"
8397,good game but civ 6 must buy
8398,"Flagship in series, turn based RTS, better than Civ 6. however the DLC isnt really worth it even on sale"
8399,"Like many considering buying this game I thought it might be a little too much to learn.

It is, but when you do, you have a near perfect strategy game.

Pros,

Awesome to play with friends on some really big maps.
Very in depth but that goes without saying.
Graphically it holds up even to this day.
With multiple Civs there are endless strategies.
Challenging AI or really simple AI.

Cons,

Allied AI in single player can be quite annoying with their military placement in your areas.
Nuke way or the highway.
War can take many turns to build up towards.
Sometimes one or two dead AI in bigger games.
RNG based system for finding resources which can be frustrating.

Aside from the above this is still an amazing game, not a pick up and play though if that is what you are looking for."
8400,It's an ok way to pass an hour or two.
8401,love this game can't get enough when i do play!
8402,good game. Really liked the graphics. Made me FEEL like I live in a civilization.
8403,I've played this game more than 1600 hours. What can I say more?
8404,Next turn syndrome is real! Fun as always.
8405,One of the best grand strategy games.
8406,It is fun
8407,"Great game, 10/10."
8408,"Great hotseat game. Relatively good AI, way better than Civ6's. Worthy successor of Civ4.
Only downside is the loss of the stacking function (versus initial Civ games) for units, which leads to ""logistical"" issues, not properly solved in the programming... But once you know the shortcomings this becomes a minor inconvenience. Would recommend it to all looking for a strategic game for 2 on cold stormy nights."
8409,Great game
8410,it's very similar to crack
8411,"""good stuff"" - aura"

8426,"This game is really fun. If you're even remotely interested in geography or history I think you'll enjoy it too. There are a ton of options for game styles and even several ways to win based on how you want to play your game. Games can be a bit lengthy depending on the size, but they are fun all the way through. I would strongly recommend this game."
8427,"I still feel Civ 2 & 3 are the most classic Civs, but this is a much bigger ""world.""  Certainly enjoyable and much better graphics."

8459,2150 hours played at time of review. Get it in a bundle on sale and you will not regret it.
8460,"I've played over 700 hours and feel like I've barely scratched the surface of this game. It's engaging, extraordinarily challenging, and the AI is fantastic for those of us who prefer the single-player experience (better AI than Civ 6). Moreover, I feel I understand human history and world politics better for having played it; I see how technologies build upon each other and why certain nations act the way they do."
8461,good game me like
8462,It's aight
8463,Grockle
8464,"Before people react to my thumbs down score, hold on a moment, and read the review - I explain it a bit at the end. (Honestly, this is another case where I wish Steam had a ""meh"" option.)

I've played Civilization since I was a kid. I remember wasting hours with Civ2, as well as playing the sci-fi and fantasy spin offs of it. (Anybody else remember those?) I played with Civ3, and played the heck out of Civ4. When I got around to doing Civ5, I was initially underwhelmed, but came back to it after some of the DLC went on sale. After playing it a bit more, what do I think?

Honestly, I still feel a bit underwhelmed. But here's the thing... it's not a BAD game. It certainly doesn't have the serious balance issues that Civ3 had. (I still remember medieval knights destroying modern tanks.) The leader animations are nice and smooth and less cartoony than you find in Civ4 (or even Civ6). However, after being wowed with all the different things I could do with Civ4, I would expect a lot more of this to be available in Civ5. I still remember in Civ4 sending missionaries to spread my religion in neighboring lands, upping my culture boosts, then watching as cities rebelled against their governments to join me. I can't do much like that in Civ5. Heck, even Civ2 offered a lot more - I loved it in Civ2 when I would capture the capital of an enemy nation and watch them descend into a civil war. Compared to Civ2, Civ5 feels really basic. A lot of times, I'm just sitting there, clicking on the ""Next Turn"" button because there's very little else for me to do other than wait for either something to be built or something to get researched. Why did they remove so much that made Civ4 so much more immersive?

Like I said, it's not a bad game in terms of bugs, core gameplay, graphics etc. So why did I say ""no"" to the question of ""do you recommend this game""? Because when you look down the line of Civilization titles, I just can't recommend this game above it the other titles. Honestly, I haven't even thought of bothering with Civ6 if this is the trend in the series. I feel like the Civilization games might as well be called ""Graphics Card Update 6"", because about all they are. Civ4 still holds up for me after all this time, and if anyone is curious about which game in the Civilization series to start with, I would recommend this. I would not suggest investing in Civ5 unless it's either on sale or you're such a die-hard fan that you just GOTTA have them all."
8465,very good
8466,too nucanced for my liking
8467,no
8468,pew pew BOOM
8469,hehe
8470,p
8471,yes
8472,"Love all the DLC, and Quii gon jin from star wars"
8473,"Well, I just have been playing this so much for so long. Tried CIV 6 but it wouldn't start on Linux so it got returned. Guess they want to get people to stop playing this old game becuse it has begun crashing.
Can't make it beyond about 500 AD becuse it crashes constantly after about 250 AD.
Has not changed anything on my end so I guess they added the same ""feature"" as Apple and Google to their devises: if [$old = ""yes"" ]; then crash to annoy user enough to buy new game;

But since CIV 6 crashed too, I was stuck with CIV 5. And I sure won't buy any more Steam games because I now knoe that there is an end date to all you buy here. Not when you want, but when they want..."
8474,gud game
8475,LOVE the game and is a lot of fun with friends. 7/10 though since it ALWAYS lags or loads wrong or people are automatically disconnected or can't move etc. Very annoying and usually spend at least 15-20 min trying to fix this before being able to actually play. I hope the devs fix this.
8476,"Multiplayer Doesn't Work, Won't Save the Correct Information when Started to Play. Has Anyone seen this Problem?"
8477,I love this game!
8478,"An Amazing classical game that stands the test of time :)

This game got 5 ways to win: Science, Domination, Cultural, Diplomatic & Time(score)

It got: Trade, War, Tradition, Culture, Tourism, Religion, Politics, Ideology Strategic/Luxury Resources, Spies, Diplomats, Writers, Scientists, Musicians, Archeologist, Artists, World Congress, United Nations, etc.

The game has all Eras starting from the Ancient Era to this day, so you're playing with Archers & Nuclear Bombers as time progress XD

You'll love it if you're into these type of games 100%!"
8479,good stuff
8480,best game ever
8481,"It's a great game. Be cautious of the time that you will spend playing it, because it is a great game! It is also certainly one of the best strategy games I've ever come across."
8482,Broken on macOS
8483,its cool i guess
8484,"Best civ of the series, hands down."
8485,Great Game!
8486,I've just given up on stopping this game.  I'm always playing it now.  There is no escape.
8487,"This is a great reminder of the horrors that civilization and progress can bring. As the used rags under my bed have finally evolved into sentient creatures and are committing nuclear terrorism across my hard-wood flooring. You would be surprised how noisy those little tadpoles can be at night! Overall, great game."

8503,"If you are a lover of turn-based strategy games, then you definitely need to pick this game up! 

Sid Meier's Civilization V, Brave New World, is a fresh take on the classic game. Offering new civilizations, new wonders, revamped social policies, as well as a fresh (and extensive) approach to potential game-play strat! This expansion is so much fun, while still being challenging and sometimes incredibly frustrating! I'm hooked!

Firaxis Games really set the bar high with this one, it's worth your time to check it out!"
8504,Best game ever !
8505,nice
8506,What if...
8507,yep
8508,good
8509,"also ik that this is so long it might as well be a book. im just using one of my past expieriences to give you an idea how the average civ game works. no game of civilization is ever the same!

-picks chieftan (cuz I'm bad at the game)
-picks america
-spawns as the only civilization on the continent (although I'd say island would be a better term)
-after colonizing the entire island and taking advantage of all the resources i research sailing so i dont have to be so isolated.
-I meet the Siamese
-I meet the Ottomans
-I meet the Russians
-I decide to take advantage of the new found resources and start a settlement.
-The city of Choccolocco is founded!
-i decide to go for a scientific victory
-The Siamese asked if they could be friends. Of course i accepted
-a few turns later and Russia wanted to be friends. i accepted. little did I know I would regret making friends with both these people....
-The Siamese asked if I wanted to go to war with the Ottomans. i said ""ask me again in ten turns""
-in these ten turns i assembled every nearby military unit in the area and created a military of...2 swordsman. (the production in choccolocco was low at the time, mind you. it was a new settlement.)
-The time for war has come. i moved my 2 swordsmen straight to the one and only city of Istanbul. I attacked them...and they took out one of my men and the other one retreated.
-help
-i waited for the siamese to arrive, but they didnt come. for a second i thought that the siamese may abandon me.
-but then, when things were at there worst, the siamese came.
-but even that wasn't enough.
-thankfully the army kept the enemy busy while i built a navy and got them to the ottoman capital.
-it was fairly obvious that the siamese army wasnt enough to defeat the capital. the capital and that one archer was fending off multiple armies.
-but it didnt matter. by the time the last of the siamese armies began to retreat, i had researched mathmatics and had a catapult! combine that with my navy, and I had totally won.
-my swordsman dealt the finishing blow and Istanbul was now an american city.
-the Siamese thanked me for helping them eliminate the ottomans.
-decided to focus on building up my already flourishing economy.
-then, out of nowhere, Russia declared war on the Siamese!
-at the time i was friends with both.
-both of them expected me to take there side in the war. 
-if i didnt take any side in the war, both of them will denounce me for not helping them when at war.
-if i choose a side the other will hate me and others will denounce me for betraying a friend.
-help
-i sent a scout to explore and they found a new continent AND the aztecs
-after getting an open borders agreement with the aztecs the scout explored the land and discovered that the aztecs pretty much owned the entire continent
-so colonizing that continent without going to war is outta the question.
-I found out that the aztecs dont ENTIRELY own the land. Egypt owns a single city. 
-egypt also denounced me and called me a warmongering menace because i helped a friend in need.
-well hello to you too.
-I pay Russia to make peace with the Siamese
-Me and siamese make a defensive pact.
-both sides get mad at me for not helping in the war
-they still seem pretty friendly towards me tho
-Russia declares war on the Siamese
-this time i dont really have a choice but to declare war on Russia...
-luckily the city with most of the military is right near a russian city
-i attack the city
-i do most of the work
-at the end the siamese swooped in and stole the city
-i decided that it was only fair that he got the city after i got the other city in the last war we had
-since most of the units i had was killed, and i wanted to focus on my economy, i made peace with russia and eventually convinced her to make peace with the siamese
-i decided not to go into any more defensive pacts since the siamese and russia couldnt get along and this clearly wouldnt be the last war they'd have
-I also got a great scientist and decided to save him for the end
-the aztecs declare war upon egypt
-i feel sorry for egypt
-i ask russia and siam if they wanna help
-they say yes
-we go straight to the capital
-then I realize that the aztecs have plenty of time to get units to the shore while we sail across the ocean
-they decimate our armies before they even get close to the capital
-he sends all his units and attacks our continent
-he destroys egypt
-he attacks everyone
-russia makes peace and then declares war on me
-siam does too
-HELP
-though my units were more advanced, they outnumbered my units
-they take istanbul
-they take choccolocco
-they sail to my continent and takes all cities except for washington
-i prepared for this and had an army ready
-i begged for peace but they refused
-i offered my smaller island bound cities
-they declined
-the city of washington, on 1842 AD, was taken by siam, who was once my strongest ally and friend.

-America has fallen

so in conclusion...its a pretty good game."
8510,Classic.
8511,Best
8512,"Base version is hillariously broken. Play it with mods like Lek Mod to balance out nations,social policies and units:

 https://docs.google.com/document/d/1XcKf5rIV_cBkBFdeaZNuq7SWQDjlYS3NcKvz0-8uI6I/edit"
8513,A very great game to play with friends and alone. The mods for it are also good. Civ 5 is much easier to learn and get the hang of the game than Civ 6 in my opinion. Civ 6 is fun but with the complexity of new features and UI its hard to grasp for those who aren't familiar with the Civ franchise.
8514,Always a good challenge
8515,You've probably played this game before but its still an addictive long play strategy game that can be as easy or complex as you like. The historical twist adds a nice touch so you feel like you're learning something while you play and the Giant Death Robots are a nice touch:)
8516,awesome

8523,I could play it over and over
8524,It's a game
8525,Everything.  I still play this game after 10 years or however long it's been out.  Every couple of years I'll install it and play it for a couple of months or so.

8536,"is like candy crush, fun to kill time
"
8537,"Really fairly terrible AI that even at lower levels the other nations grow and develop at unrealistic rates.   I've played on easy where a few nations hit medieval era in BC timeline.  You'd have to have built twice as many cities, grown the population at the same time, learn 3x the technology, in about 20 moves.  Literally not possible, yet the game just goes along like it's normal.  I think the lowest difficulty setting may be the only one where the competition is developing at the same rate.   Enjoyable game but it would be nice if devs would not have to cheat to get their wonky AI to seem balanced.

Decided to play after some time off. Play at Chieftain, which is moderate/easy (3 on a 8 scale) Alexander starts directly next to me, so I am watching his two cities, no workers, nothing upgraded, zero production benefits.  My 2 cities at around round 30 were sized 6 and 2, his were 3 and 2.  Barely tadpoles.  He completes 3 world wonders in this time, with one scout running around trying to find ruins.  Of course the barbarians only engage me.  I have everything pushed to get pyramids to boost production.  After researching, I'm ready to get it in 7 turns.  With mod running, I see Alexander is now about to complete it with absolutely no bonuses... I mean the only way to play the game is to just attack other countries for their wonders, it's trash programming. Enjoy."

8563,"ONE, MORE. TURN!!!!!!"
8564,best game
8565,This game is great especially with friends. My favorite feature is being able to progress through different eras. I find it really fun to watch your civilization grow over time and advance in technology. Your ability to work or go to war with other civilizations allows for many playstyles and strategies to be used.

Cons:
-Occasional server issues with online

Overall:
Excellent game, well worth the price and is often on sale.  Games can easily take 8+ hours and somehow the time flies by in seconds.  A must buy for PC gang."
8584,spent too many hours playing this game. its too good
8585,"Civ 5 is, [i]in theory[/i], one of the best turn based strategy games. I've always enjoyed the Civilization series' gameplay, especially with all of the different routes you can take to winning the game, either going for military conquest, technological, economical, or cultural superiority or a mix of approaches. 

Unfortunately, I cannot recommend this game to anyone due to instability issues I've experienced. I play an unmodded copy of the game on a computer that can [b]more than handle[/b] running the game, and yet, I've never managed to finish a single game of Civ 5 due to crashes and gamesave files apparently becoming corrupted. I would have returned it if I could, but I ran up too many hours before the problem started to rear its ugly head.

I've tried every fix I could find online, between changing game settings, trying to play in ""Offline Mode"", all the way to a full uninstallation and reinstallation of [b]BOTH Civ 5 AND Steam.[/b]

Maybe you'll have better luck than I had, but don't recommend paying more than a few dollars for it because there's a fair chance it won't be playable for you either!"
8586,"Sid Meier's Civilization® V is a very addicting and fun game, with tons of reasons to play it from time to time. Even though it's not the newest Civ game; It feels great to master it and see the world grow as you play. I bought the game including Gods and Kings DLC. It is cheap and that lured me into checking it out after a long time not playing this kind of games on PC. 

Plussss and Minnnn's

+Looks nice
+Feels nice
+Plays nice
+Very Cheap for Full game
+Good to get used to controls before playing the newer Civ

8595,Awesome strategy game.
8596,yes
8597,arguably the best civ game. i think this game is better than 6
8598,Good game to pass a few hours or days or weeks.

8608,just a good game
8609,GG
8610,Every time I play this game it is a unique experience.  I love how many different scenarios there are!
8611,The only game you can spend DAYS playing xD
8612,JUST ONE MORE TURN
8613,"This is the last version of Civilization I've tried that caters to those who are (often derisively) referred to as ""casual"" players -- those who want to putter around and have fun with a game without taking it too seriously.  It is simply a fun way to wind down from achieving real-world accomplishments, rather than a substitute for that."
8614,"This is without a doubt the best game I have played on steam, and potentially the most fun game I have ever played. The inner workings of the game are creative and work great, and its truly fun to play and improve at. Even though I got this game years ago, I find myself returning to play all the time and try out different civs in different scenarios, and also trying to win with the different difficulties and the different victory types. Also, trying out some of the mods or scenario packs can really spice up the game after you have played for a while. I have not a single complaint about this game! I recommend this to anyone who wants a fun strategy game!"

8630,Its alright I guess
8631,"Civilization V stopped working for me on Steam.  Unable to open the game
"
8632,"Fun, challenging, and super addictive. Be prepare to lose 20-50 hours on a single campaign, depending on the parameters you set for yourself. It's also very well-designed and intuitive; I've never played a Civ game before and I was able to get a handle on its mechanics. It's just excellent overall."
8633,Great turn-based conquest and expansion game without requiring conquest to win
8634,"Fun game, just as Civ 3 and 4 were. I prefer playing with IGE (world editor) so I can ""cheat"" but I actually had the most fun when I didn't use IGE and had to play legit! Always a challenge to get all the wonders and secure your own continent before someone else cuts in on whats rightfully yours and forces you to destroy their entire civilization :D"

8670,Great game - got to have one more turn!!!
8671,"still playing on the same cds i bought at i think sam goody since it first came out . same with 4 and 3 . mwahahahahahaha . goos times here , i have spent a lot of time over the years , way way before steam getting nuked by ghandi . worth it. don`t get 6 , or beyond the what ever , they are plain awful."
8672,I didn't even buy civ 6. I'll just keep playing this forever.
8673,"Really fun, it's essentially a board game on steroids, and I've played this whole series for years. Each version of the game shifts different variables around to keep everything feeling fresh and new!

On a technical standpoint, this version (Civ V) is really good for modest and top-rate systems alike! It's Direct X 9 based natively, but with a more modern system it runs even better in Direct X 10/11 mode!"
8674,"Probably my favorite of the CIv games. Get all the dlc to fix any problems and expand the list of factions and it's a very interesting strategy game that invented the term ""one more turn"". It can take a long time before you realize you're not #1 and the AI isn't too dynamic but you can build your own history from ancient times to killer robots."
8675,Absolutely recommend it.
8676,Very fun and great for killing time and just relaxing.
8677,"i wish i could give this game 10 stars, because its that good. i have put close to 450 hours into this game and i still go back to it when im bored of other games. some may say that a measly 450 hours isnt much, but for those of us who have lives and still love games thats a lot of time loll. i have put more  hours into very few other games, and i have seen many games come out with the all kinds of hype. people hype up games like they are the best thing ever but i find them to get boring after a while and eventually it just sits in the bottom of my library not played for months or longer. but this game, i always find myself coming back to this game. i have also put in a little over 100 hours in the 6th one on another platform but i still think this one is the best in the franchise. this game has unparalleled gameplay and graphics, it has a ridiculous amount of mods in the workshop as well if you are looking for something more to add to the regular gameplay. I myself have tried a couple different mods, but i always find myself playing straight up games. the 6th one is great as well, but i feel like it has a bit too much going on for my taste. dont get me wrong the 6th one is great as well, i just prefer this one. it is simple and a beginner could pick it up very quickly. i love that you can choose your difficulty and even if you are the best player in the world and can beat the hardest difficulty easily, you can just randomize ai personalities and add a whole new element of gameplay. i also have played online with some buddies and had 0 lag, it was completely smooth gameplay for all of us. i also enjoy playing the hotseat mode too. i have put this much time in and i feel like i still dont know enough to describe how great this game really is. all i have left to say really is hats off to the creators, excellent job team."
8678,Good gameplay takes awhile to play but there are 4 winning options to choose from
8679,"Just got this game 9 hours ago. Was worried I would not enjoy it, but it was insanely addicting. I am not the type of person to get addicted to games, especially long ones full of grinding, but this one kept me playing for 350 turns, or 9 hours, straight. Can't wait to play more."
8680,cool stuff
8681,Better than real life
8682,"I have spent almost 82 solid days playing this game.... And I regret none of it. I imagine in another 10 years it'll still be on my rotation of regular games. Worth every dollar, once you've spent a thousand hours - google vox populi. That'll make the game brand new again and down the hole you go again."

8701,god
8702,Feel free to play this game.
8703,Worth the money; fun alone or with friends and good replay value.
8704,"This game is my favorite out of all the Sid Meier's Civ series. Not only is the DLC great, but the community and workshop around this game is phenomenal. The base game is fun, challenging, and replayability is through the roof. You can come back again and again to this game and never get bored because something new always happens! The DLC is amazing too though! You can get different scenario packs, religions, or entirely new civs that will all add new elements that force you to rethink your approaches to winning your desired victory for the game. Lastly, there is a spectacular mod community for this game that can allow you to do thing you never thought could happen in civ. From ""waifu civs"" to skyrim and LOTR, there is literally a mod in the workshop for everything.

That being said, the base game alone is well worth the money, but taking into account the workshop community, the DLC, and replayability, you should definitely buy this game. This game has it's place in every persons library."
8705,Realized i never reviewed civ5... what a game.
8706,you can conquer Jerusalem
8707,Gahndi wishes he could be as fly as me.
8708,So Good.
8709,i still prefer version V over VI
8710,Eu4 hurts my head to look at. this is a pretty solid alternative.
8711,dont play this game
8712,1005 hours....  I still can't beat the game on the next to hardest level.... Shit I suck...
8713,nice i like :)

8719,best civ and far superioir to civ 6
8720,i like to create massive maps and slowly dominate the world with nuclear wapons. Peace through superior firepower! more explosions this way. 9/10
8721,just fun
8722,Looking at this makes me happy
8723,Something different than traditional Civilization games.
8724,"Good Game
"
8725,All time classic steam game
8726,best game
8727,As addicting as Civ IV though DLC are necessary to play the game to its potential. Something something one more turn.
8728,It's the best civ still
8729,Doesn't work on windows 10
8730,nice
8731,"She sells seashells on a seashore
But the value of these shells will fall
Due to the laws of supply and demand
No one wants to buy shells 'cause there's loads on the sand
Step 1: you must create a sense of scarcity
Shells will sell much better if the people think they're rare, you see
Bare with me, take as many shells as you can find and hide 'em on an island stockpile 'em high
until they're rarer than a diamond
Step 2: you gotta make the people think that they want 'em
Really want 'em, really fuckin want 'em
Hit 'em like Bronson
Influencers, product placement, featured prime time entertainment If you haven't got a shell then you're just a fucking waste man
Three: it's monopoly, invest inside some property, start a corporation, make a logo, do it properly
""Shells must sell"", that will be your new philosophy
Swallow all your morals they're a poor man's quality
Four: expand, expand, expand, clear forest, make land, fresh blood on hand
Five: why just shells? Why limit your self? She sells seashells, sell oil as well!
Six: guns, sell stocks, sell diamonds, sell rocks, sell water to a fish, sell the time to a clock
Seven: press on the gas, take your foot off the brakes, Run to be the president of the United States
Eight: big smile mate, big wave that's great Now the truth is overrated, tell lies out the gate
Nine: Polarize the people, controversy is the game
It don't matter if they hate you if they all say your name
Ten: the world is yours, step out on a stage to a round of applause You're a liar, a cheat, a devil, a whore
And you sell seashells on the seashore"
8732,Get to take over the world its pretty poggers
8733,"Credo una delle meglio saghe costruite e che hanno avuto un successo strepitoso in chi ama i giochi di strategia. In particolare Civilization V rispetto a il VI. 
Per conto mio pur essendo un prodotto ormai passato nelle leggende di steam , vecchio, non E' MAI DIVENTATO VECCHIO , perchè se andate su steam charts vedrete che tiene testa a civ VI.
Quindi perchè tiene testa ? perchè è ben fatto ! divertente ! - come tutti gli episodi delle saghe c'è sempre quello che è fatto meglio come descritto prima :
1 . LA GRAFICA NON INVECCHIA.
2. LA BELLA COLONNA SONORA NEMMENO.
3. IL GAMEPLAY NEMMENO A DIRLO - sto ancora giocando a mod di Faerun o come si chiama !
4. I MOD HANNO AUMENTATO LA GIOCABILITA' TANTO DA FARLO ARRIVARE AL 2021.
ora - ma veramente ancora non lo avete in libreria come HALF LIFE  ?
"
8734,"i need some help, when i launch the game it just goes back to the steam page? can anyone help with this please...
"
8735,"Top 50 game all time based on fun gameplay, and cool aspects and mods that kept me coming back for more!"
8736,fun game to play on acid with headphones on marathon from start to finish at least once in your life.
8737,Best strategy game ive ever played
8738,good
8739,is aight
8740,....just one more turn
8741,great game
8742,It's fun and calm!
8743,really stale and repetetive after 4 or 5 games so i played hundreds 10/10
8744,"Hooks you up like a drug with an illusion of immense power and control over lives of millions. After the high is gone you have nothing left over, this game doesn't provoke any thinking or thought, you just crave another meaningless win over your opponents. 

Some people are okay with it, I am not. I would rather play Brian Reynold's Alpha Centauri. Does the same thing much better and remains an unbeatable intellectual philosophical pleasure to this day, it is just a little bit old. I wish we had a proper sequel."
8745,"When I was first married, I used to get annoyed at how long my husband would spend playing this game. Then he taught me how to play it. Now I'm right there with him!"
8746,"I love this game, can go on for hours and you'll never get bored!"
8747,........
8748,"Well made game, good graphics and decent AI. Multiplayer works well, too."
8749,sometimes there's a barb camp
8750,"The game is pretty cool, simple to get the hang of for a TBS, Be sure to get it on a sale and get all the DLC for the full effect.

Also fuck Ghandi"
8751,I promised myself I would stop playing after one more turn. Well that ended up being 200 more turns.
8752,Civilization V definitely makes this pandemic easier to tolerate!!!
8753,"This game is still as good as it was when it was new more than a decade ago now. Some minor bugs but nothing that breaks the game, namely the sound can glitch out if you alt-tab out of the game and will remain that way for as long as it's still running. Beyond that, it's a fantastic play.

If you're new to Civilization and are curious where to start, or are looking to gift the game to a friend who is new? This is the one to go with. It's simple enough to learn all the basics and difficult enough to learn to min-max it in the long run, without the complexity that its sequel Civ 6 has."
8754,great game
8755,The game is good but why is the dlc so expensive still? The game is so old. the fact that it gates you to play with people in multiplayer by forcing you to own the dlc they own is wild.
8756,gg
8757,first pc game i ever played :) eternally addictive and a classic.
8758,so fucking fun omg
8759,"Great strategy game, good for those with patience.  I found that if you spend approximately 10 minutes playing this game, about 10 hours have passed in the real world"
8760,good
8761,its a game
8762,Perhaps the best of all the Civ series. It is well balanced and they've done some terrific fine tuning of certain features that make building up cities and military campaigns great fun.
8763,"My personal favorite 4X game, unti Civ VI hit, and now that it's having issues, I'm back to Civ V when I'm jonesing for the Civ experience. It's held up well and is just as enjoyable as before, with only a few things lacking that i enjoyed about VI. 
It is very Mod friendly, which major support by great modders. In fact they have picked up where the Devs left off and Civ V no has the ability to support more content than Civ VI. I have to give kudos to the modders, who even went to work to fix glitches left by Devs when they quit supporting this game to create Civ VI. It ruyns better now than it ever did when supported by Firaxis.
It still has excellent multiplayer play, including Hotseat (though there are a few Mods I recommend adding to make it truly enjoyable.) There are still a ton of active players, so filling your games should be no problem.  
Also, do to the game's age, it doesn't need nearly as many resources to run as many newer 4X games. Drop this thing onto an SSD and almost forget about load times. I run over 300 mods on my copy and my semi-out of date system (5th Gen I7 with a 1050 graphics card) has no problems running the game.

It might lack some of the fanciness of newer 4X games, but will remain enjoyable for a long while (and it looks better than the cartoony Civ VI)"
8764,"i play civ very casually, and it is one of the most consistently enjoyable games i have played."
8765,Its a great game with a lot of strategy but each game take so long time.
8766,"Religion is the appeal for me in this game, as well as the ability to take my time to play. It is stimulating and relaxing, simultaneously."
8767,Great game to play if you like this types of games
8768,its 'birds eye view' Cod
8769,"Great game, always love the Civ games."
8770,"Fantastic game, time sinker if I've ever seen one as you can see from my time played. Miraculously, stands the test of time as well as the test of a newer iteration of the game, which in my opinion was acutely worse."
8771,I don't usually like turn based strategy games but this game is really good.
8772,"Even if you can even get Civ V running, it crashes too much to play.

Once upon a time, Civ V was a good, refreshing, set of changes to the franchise. It had much better pacing than older versions, and finally introduced the hexes and simultaneous multiplayer previously only available in freeciv.
Now it seems to have been maintained to not work, so that you buy Civ VI instead.

Consider instead:
Wesnoth
Freecivweb - freeciv in a browser."
8773,"Probably one of the best games of its genre. If you like turn-based strategy games then this game definitely suits for you. Watch out though, makes you easily an addict for playing after a while."
8774,Awesome game
8775,good
8776,"gud
"
8777,good game bruh
8778,Best game to sit down and forget you have a brain.
8779,"A very complicated game with many ways to win, many ways to play, and many ways to fuck up. 
Pros: Very interactive and addictive
Cons: 1 more turn could lead to not eating for 24 hours and getting incredibly bloodshot. Enjoy at your own risk."
8780,babbys first strategy game. Stay clear. It's fucking ass.
8781,It's like chess but WAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAY more complicated and waaaay more fun
8782,great

8786,good brain game
8787,"i enjoy this game, spend hours playing."
8788,better then 6 Alot more fun

8809,iojana
8810,good game.
8811,"No Mac/Windows crossplay
Many of my fondest memories with this game were playing multiplayer matches with my friends, many of whom have the game on Mac. Sadly that is no longer possible :("
8812,"This is a good game.

If you'd like to launch the game without the 2k launcher, right-click the game in your library>Properties and in the 'Set Launch Options' type the path to the Civ 5 .exe file wherever you installed it, followed by %command%. Should look something like this: 

""C:\Games\Steam\SteamApps\common\Sid Meier's Civilization V\Base\Binaries\Win64Steam\CivilizationV.exe"" %command%

You can also use the DX_11 .exe as well.

"
8813,I've owned this game for three years and have finished exactly two games
8814,It's pretty okay.
8815,Still in 2021 the best Civ game there have ever been. You always want just one more turn.
8816,I love this game
8817,"The game is very fun the replayability is not even a question, it has nearly infinite possibilitys to how things will turn out and it is better than six in some ways but not all. 
"
8818,Historical strategic action.
8819,"The best iteration of the Civ franchise. I recommend playing on standard settings but with science victory turned off once you've done that victory at least once, as it's the least interesting victory to pursue."
8820,I feel that this is the best version of Civilization if you do not have a graphics card.  Civ VI runs slow for me...
8821,its fun and easy to play
8822,"By far the best Civ game to date. While Civ VI was innovative with districts and tweaks to religions and such, overall, Civ V is superior. Graphically, mechanically, etc. It's a timeless classic, with a still-active modding community adding additional layers to this already deep game."
8823,Civ is good
8824,Better than civ 6
8825,fun and challenging gameplay make decisions to conquer all!!!
8826,help
8827,"A great game, I'd strongly recommend getting it but not advisable at playing at higher difficulty settings if you are rather competitive in gaming.

This is a fantastic game first and foremost. I love it, just starting up your own tiny civilization and building it up into a massive empire has a massive charm to it. There are many reviews on here that will inform you of this... But I do want to talk about a negative and that is personally from me a MASSIVE NEGATIVE in this game and that is difficulty levels....

Difficulty on this game... and to be fair I will say the game tells you itself ""it gives the AI unfair advantages"" - As you raise difficulty levels....(I myself have got to 6 out of 8 in difficulty level on standard mode...thats 500 moves per game, and I nearly got to 7 out of 8 on an epic mode once which is 750 moves). The problem is the number of moves doesn't scale well...I don't believe it's possible to win an 8 out of 8 difficulty mode in quick game mode which is 330 moves unless you completely understand how the AI in this game operates.

My last quick game mode went...not badly in my opinion for what I did, I started no wars, I was minding my own business, but I just stood no chance...I got wiped out of the game for no reason other than my neighbour pedro of brazil had a chip on his shoulder and I feel also was possibly a racist,  within turn 130 he had a bajillion knights and I have to use the word a bajillion because the sheer number of units he sent upon me in his wrath would just not be done justice in the million or billionth realm.. .....I killed many but the computer just keeps spawning them, the computer does not care at this difficulty level for the rules of the game.... ""Need horses to build a particular unit?""  = screw it ...""need time to build a unit""  = screw it - the computer cares not for the rules that us flesh and blood mere mortals have to follow.....Strategically the computer is dumb as F....I  personally could of taken over my own base in a quarter of the time without losing as many units as the Computer Civ did, it just........well cheats......it spawns units it doesn't have the resources for and totally forgoes the rules of the game.

Now I'll be honest I don't know how you'd program an AI in this game with difficulty levels, but it just seems.....i don't know.......like you're not playing the game but understanding the AI operations better each time you ramp up the difficulty settings.

Let me put it this way...in a game of chess you know the computer is holding back, but if you beat a computer consistently on higher difficulty levels you're almost certainly getting better at chess and are going to beat average chess players consistently. The computer in chess games isn't ""cheating"" it's not doing moves you could never do, its just holding back...in this game the computer is dumb AF and doesn't know strategies but only knows how to spawn troops infinitely and get advantages with important components in the game like ""science""  which is an important aspect of progressing the game.....beating strong AI in this game doesn't make you a better Civ player. IF You beat strong AI in this game it doesn't mean you'd smash the average civ player...like beating a strong chess computer means you'd beat an average chess player. It just means you understand how the AI operates more than other people....which just seems...I don't know......I want to say depressing but that's too strong a word for it maybe."
8828,i love it
8829,Its a fun stat game
8830,"Vidi caelum novum, Terra novam a Deo

8831,I always end up back here.
8832,I've been playing  Civilization VI for the last year but recently its been taking up to 30 minutes to load and then after playing an hour or so it crashes and I can't recover without restarting the computer.  So its back to V .
8833,Better than Civ6
8834,Amazing game
8835,nice game
8836,Great game . Love every second of it. Only downside is getting Civ 6 and not being able to play anymore
8837,Good for when you want to play something that doesn't require all of your attention.
8838,epic
8839,"easy to get into, very solid re-playable game."
8840,Played it a bit. Its fun I guess.

8859,It's fun getting nuked by Ghandi
8860,"Honest classic, been playing on and off since I finished middle school, I'm now in college, and I can still always count on this game to bring me a good time. Have always had an absolute blast either with friends or usually just running a campaign against the AI. Although I'm not the biggest fan of the late game I still wholeheartedly believe that every single stage of the game is an absolute blast. From the deep and captivating voice of the late William Morgan Sheppard, to the art, designs, better than expected combat systems, and nations I fell in love with this game from the moment I finished my first campaign. I played as Alexander The Great, spawned in western china, had no concept of diplomacy and then proceeded to conquer the entire Eurasian super-continent with unbelievable 14 year old angst and blood lust. Just a fantastic game."
8861,Fix the launch window problem
8862,Funny
8863,Just a fun game of what ifs.
8864,best civ @ me
8865,Still the best CIV game.
8866,Good strategy game and has alot of freedom to do whatever
8867,"While this game is excellent, Civilization VI does much of what Civilization V does in a more developed and interesting way, Yes, Civilization V is a classic for many and may be worth playing, probably just get Civilization VI instead."
8868,Awesome game!!! Civ 5 is likely my favorite Civ.
8869,"Been playing Civ games since the original.  The turn based approach to world domination may not be the most exciting, but balancing military power, diplomatic pressure, and technological advancement makes it one of the most thought provoking and entertaining games I have played."
8870,Still one of the best strategic games.
8871,Game
8872,"I've just dipped my toes in a bit here, but seems like a VERY good turn based strategy game. AI isn't the smartest and sucks at naval combat but still worth playing a time or two."
8873,Best Civ I've played
8874,"Civ 5 is one of the better games I played, it is not for everyone though but with regards to my preferences I would highly reccomend this game! Downsides is that you have to join NQ group to get a decent multiplayer game and that a game at average takes at least 4 hours!"
8875,"Normally I don't play strategy games, but every so often one is so good that I just have to play it. Civ 5 is so fun and addicting, the only downside is that it's hard to find the time to play it. Every game of Civ feels unique thanks to it's deep gameplay mechanics and a multitude of maps and leaders to choose from (Each of those leaders have their own unique abilities to take advantage of).

I've played the expansions and both of them are great additions to the Civ 5 experience (Gods and Kings/Brave New World).

[h1]Rating: 5/5[/h1]"
8876,"pretty, pretty. pretty good"
8877,The best CIV game so far. Plenty of MODs make for fun extended game play.
8878,Best damn game ive ever bought and played. I can return to it multiple times after leaving it for other things and it will always be super fun to play. Sadly civ 5 kept crashing after like an hour each time I play so eh theres some bugs but its a great game other than that. Yes ghandi nuked me.
8879,Addicting
8880,Good time killer
8881,Game Good
8882,ive played this for years so soothing
8883,i only have 1706 hours on this game because i left my computer on with it running for 71.083333 days

8890,"The game you play when you want to get away from your friends, or if you're playing with your friends the game where you spend 20 hours on a game to lose to fucking Babylon because they spawned in the Jungle and get more research per turn than you get in your whole game. 8/10"
8891,"best civ game,"
8892,this is civ 5

8894,Very nice
8895,It's aight.
8896,love this game.. still playing after so many years.. will continue to play.. definitely worth buying
8897,"Closest a video game has ever come to replicating the feeling of a really fun board game, even in 2021. If you don't consider that high praise, it might not be for you, but if you do think that sounds interesting, you're gonna love it."
8898,Fuck you Michael
8899,"Best Civilization game to date. Its just soooo crisp, and good. 

I love this game; I have spent many all nighters till 6 am playing it."

8908,175 hours and still having fun.
8909,great game
8910,Good
8911,Bought this game for around 45 euros; worth every cent :)
8912,The game itself is good but the price comparing to Amazon To Steam Full game with DLC included its a rip off. Amazon offers 24.99 for the game and its DLC while Steam offers 49.33 for the full game and its DLCs.
8913,nice
8914,"Just... one... more... turn...


Seriously I'm addicted. The gameplay gets easy enough after a few games, it's adjustable to many skill levels. There's multiplayer but I've not got many people to play with so I've not tested it yet."
8915,Its fun
8916,"Barbarians are forcing me to write a good review for this game, otherwise they will take my settlers for a hundredth time."
8917,Probably 1 of my favorite games of all time .... replayability is near endless
8918,"Its a great game of the ages. Build to survive, get to Space, or to conquer the world."
8919,"This game is good, you will spend many hours on it, it's great ... yadi yada yada etc etc. It doesn't need me to tell you that.

But what I do see everyone saying more and more is what annoys me: People compare this game to Europa Universalis 4 a lot. They say EU4 has more content, more stats, more numbers, more ""stuff"" - therefore it is the better and deeper game. 

You couldn't be more wrong. Bloat doesn't mean depth. A 5 year-old can be taught the rules of chess. The pawn moves this way, the king that way: the rules, the ""game mechanics"" are extremely simple.  And yet, it is the most complicated game known to mankind (and even to ""computerkind"") by far, with maybe the only exception being the Chinese game of Go. Why? Because it is elegant. You can prove a hypothesis on 50 pages, or you can do it on 1. Again: Bloat doesn't mean depth.

Civ5 has just the right amount of ""rules"" and game mechanics to make it, just like chess, probably the most replayable game ever. What's more, conquest isn't the only path to victory. What bores me very quickly about other 4x games is that at the end of the day, it's all just about conquest, conquest, conquest. Everything is just a means for war. Paint the map with your colours. Exciting the first couple times, but then: yawn. It gets very old very fast (at least for me).

Anyway, this game, especially with the brilliant Vox Populi mod, is in my opinion perfection. That's all."
8920,swd
8921,"Playing this game is great, almost like a peyote-fueled vision quest except instead of learning deep truths about yourself and the world around you, you just learn that Ghandi is a vengeful god of destruction and that Darius is a bitch who really needs to stop denouncing me."
8922,"Really good and fun game but shit AI bots. It's pointless having any relations and political connections with AI leaders in that game. No matter what you do you get backstabbed by retarded bot. Soon or later even if it's friendly it will declare war on you just pointless it's better when you treat everyone as the enemy from the beginning of the game, won't have a bad surprise later in the game."
8923,"A really nice strategy game!! There are so many ways to go when playing this game. Each of the decisions needs to be well-planned in order to gain the maximum profit. There are also historical contexts that allows players to imagine the environments that time.
真心覺得不錯玩"
8924,very epic just dont run out of money

8926,Wonderful game.  Carries on the CIV legacy well.
8927,"Perfection, well and... ITS JUST GOOD, its way better then civ six, a good player is france, germany and the US due to the basic but decent units and upgrades."
8928,It's ok
8929,yeah its ok
8930,i likte it
8931,"Better Than Civ 6
"
8932,"No - I'd say after 31 years of Civ, it is kinda shitty - the age old problem, same issue in an Total War game - if you border a AI, you will eventually get attacked. Makes 50% of the game time daft.

If only AI could be interesting amongst themselves then 4x games might be fun after 30 years of the same old daft rubbish.

I don't see AI getting much more interesting, given the fact apparently educated people actually voted for Trump ..."

8934,good

8942,"You have 2 options: play boring (no army, no war, no conquest), or fight the entire world and your own civ's massive unhappiness because you accidentally won a war against another civ."
8943,"Great game with loads of replayability. Despite it's age, and the newest release, I would rather play this installment of the series than play Civilization 6."

8959,"Still better than CIV6 if you wish to play a hex-grid style civiliztion game, this is the only choice you are looking for (hex civ). You spend much less and will still have very good time."

Just the game and its expansions alone can provide thousands of hours of content and there's Steam Workshop on top of that. Sorry if this review wasn't great, stayed up all night playing Civ..."

Here's to humankind being the ""Civ killer"" when it releases......"
8983,Why haven't you bought this yet?
8984,+1
8985,good
8986,"best civ so far , Vi is boring"
8987,great
8988,"OK, this is a tough one.

This is a very playable game, as you can imagine from my +500 hours. 

But is it worth buying in 2021, as as You can imagine if you get it, you have to get DLC:s as well, to get religions as well and so forth. And there is Civ 6 available also, and the price is with DLC's somewhat comparable.

Along the series of civs, this is one of the good ones. Not the best, but very good. A lot of maps, a lot of nations and gameplay truly varies in different settings. But, this is not the best of the series, which I would rank civ 4, which to my knowledge isn't readily available. Religion in this one is very similar to civ6 and it is not so strategically effective as in civ4, but it's spicy. Different nations are refreshing, but not changing the whole gameplay. You can see this game is old, as it is not fully supporting 4k graphics and there are some glitches, but if You don't have eyes of gold, I think they don't really matter.

But in conclusion: If you don't own civ6, I don't think you gain much by owning this and civ6 is a better deal if You don't get a really ridicilous discount from the whole pack including DLC's. If you own civ6, don't bother."
8989,Engaging and refined 4X gameplay from the grandfather of the genre.
8990,Yes

8992,the gold standard. best game in the series in my opinion.

9018,"Originally I wanted to get a diplomacy victory as Germany, so I went for it. Eventual got bored and decided to kill Spain and her friends. Then because of my massive warmongering I got denounced and backstabbed by my friends. Even though I nuked alot of people I still won through diplomacy. 
Truly amazing"

9064,"DO NOT PAY FULL PRICE FOR THIS GAME. If you get a deal at 5$ or 10$, go for it, but NEVER BUY THIS FULL PRICE. The game is too glitchy for that.

Don't get me wrong, this is a great game, BUT... it's amazing that a full release with plenty of time to publish bug fixes is still full of glitches! For example, when you play a multiplayer game, the game skips 1 or 2 of your turns when loading a saved game, allowing the computer plenty of time to destroy your armies during a war. 

I mean, how hard is it to load a game? Come on! And they're selling the full game for like 70$. Thieves!"

I enjoyed the balance of each civilization and the excessive replay value. This is an extremely well made game. Even with Civ 6 out for many years, this game still stands up as an all time great, even among the greatest of strategy games."

[b] What I Liked [/b]

It's a Civilization game.  It improves on everything from the last game.  What else is there to say?

[b] What I Did Not Like [/b]

DLC, of course.  Other than that, not much.

[b] Why I Stopped Playing [/b]

I've played these games to death, so they don't hold my attention as much as they used to, so I moved on.

[b] Disclaimer [/b]

I have been a gamer for over 30 years.  I tend to play mostly PC games.  I also bounce around between games A LOT.  I may purchase a $60 game and play it for 2 hours or spend $10 on a game and spend 50 hours on it.  Even if I played a game a short time, it does not mean it is bad.  It just means another game caught my attention.  I also complain about flaws in games a lot, even about the littlest of things.  Keep that in mind when reading my reviews.  If I do not have a complaint, then the game must be special!
"
9156,Awesome!
9157,"I have not played the 6th part yet, but I can't really imagine how you could implement this game concept better than with this game! 
I was never really interested in round based strategy games but this game proved me wrong. To develop a game so complex and varied, yet still pretty much balanced is a huge feat of the developers. Many details feel like they have been polished for decades (aside from controlling the map by the arrow-keys instead of WASD, but there's mods for it ^^).

Explicit recommendation to everyone interested in strategy games!"
9158,Nice
9159,"I'm at 100 hours so i figured this is probably the opportune time to post a review.

Civ 5 is the best of all civs.
Played Civ 6 for a couple dozen hours as well but it honestly aint as good as 5 (i said what i said).

The amount of mods 5 has is one of the biggest decisive factors on said decision.
You can turn this game around and change it in to a RPG kind of D&D empire builder using the Faerun mod.
Or you could get the Middle Earth mod and play the hobbits during Lord Of The Rings.
Hell , there's even a mod that lets you play as Hamas and the Iraqi insurgents , etc. VS George Bush and other modern western forces like Britain , lol.

If you are going for the classic game though , i still advise you to get the R.E.D. mod, which is a purely cosmetic mod that gives units skins that are true to their faction.

This greatly increases immersion as the base game makes all standard units look the same for every faction (which I personally always really freakin hated). Civ 6 , again, does not have this mod, and thus all battle tanks for example look exactly the same.

Seeing Germany deploy the same tanks as the USis just.... incredibly wack."
9160,Still a great game!
9161,.
9162,love it. be careful to not spend an entire day on it. remember to eat and go to the bathrooom
9163,Solid entry to the series!
9164,A
9165,"The classic go to for a turn based strategy game. Known for its ability to keep you up all night just to reach that next goal you have in mind.

So may possibilities, endless fun. Pick one of many races, each with different play styles. You can just turtle and show everyone how your culture and swagger is the best and win, or you can just roll over them with your armies. Your choice, build up your empire and conquer the word! Just... remember to look at the time."
9166,"Civ 5 is one of my highest played games. Easy yo come home from work, throw on some music and forget about life for a moment. 10/10 would get. Also recommend getting the DLC to add more depth to the game"
9167,Good game good good. Very fun. So fun. yes.
9168,This is the ultimate long term strategy game and it is totally addicting.
9169,ok
9170,yo
9171,very fun but a lot of people would probably think it's boring
9172,you just keep play for some reason idk
9173,good

9180,we can't finish a game... but it's fun

9184,"I've been playing Civ since the original version on PC, with the blocky tiles and all. Still love it. Keep coming back to this game, over and over again, decades later. Cannot recommend enough."
9185,Yes. just yes
9186,Game just sometimes stops working - never did that as a CD but does so here
9187,"The great thing about this game is its replay-ability, which is very high IMO. Each game will essentially hit the same main bullet points - settling cities, exploring the map, researching tech, and trying to win in one of the 5 -6 victory options, but it's how you get there that makes it fun and interesting. No map will be the exact same, and no AI will make the same decisions. I've put over 700 hours into this game, so needless to say I feel it's worth buying."
9188,good game
9189,Who plays this game in 2030?
9190,whoaa
9191,I've played it a little. I kinda recommend it. Two thumbs up.
9192,Shit game
9193,Beautiful strategy game. Enough said
9194,fun
9195,"One of, if not the best, game of its kind. Spent many days sitting playing this and didnt regret one minute of it."
9196,muchos poggers
9197,yesssssssssssss
9198,"I liked this a lot! While Civ IV felt a whole lot better to me, I quite like the unique abilities given to each civilization as opposed to the underwhelming mix and match skill system that IV had. No longer having the death stack of doom was also a good call. 
People joke about how this game will keep you playing till the early hours of the morning, and that is no exaggeration. It is so engaging and is such a huge timesink because stuff just keeps happening. Exploring the map, negotiating with other civilizations, settling new cities, fighting for resources, researching new technology and managing your cities will keep you glued to your seat. A must have for both casual and hardcore players. 9/10"
9199,Ever wonder what history would be like if the world was run by people with severe bipolar disorder?
9200,Its meh
9201,"A beautifully designed game, and quite possibly one of the best 4x ones"
9202,Even though this game ruined 4 of my elopements and murdered my 3 year old child i still manage to love it.
9203,
9204,Wanna stay up for 3 days playing 1 round of a game to have it crash out on you and not be able to be reloaded?  Then boy do I have a game for you
9205,great game
9206,"Great game, but it's been 11 years and I think it's time for me to move on"
9207,its very good
9208,"I recently bought this game on my own pc after playing it on my dad's old rig when I was younger. I forgot how much I loved this game, it's rather easy to get the hang of and once you play it, it's hard to stop which is something to be aware of.

Have fun!"

9210,"Need to play it a little before i can give a detailed review. Highly recommend this game! do not download if you need to do anything or require sleep at all.

9213,the best civ
9214,Still the best IMO
9215,One of the greatest strategy games of all time!
9216,"It's alright, I guess."
9217,"Better then Civ 6
"
9218,GOAT
9219,"I can only run this game in strategic mode. My pc can't handle the great wall. Still worth. 
"
9220,Amazing Game! One of my favorite games period.
9221,pog
9222,"11 year later and I still find myself reinstalling to play again, timeless turn based strategy that you can easily dive into for hours at a time"
9223,"Really nice game to play if you have 2-3 days to spare and when you have nothing to do, you can start a game and get so obssessed with growing, i personally played the first 20 hours straight and then i didnt play it for another 6 months and played it again for another 20 and they were both really fun 20 hours"
9224,I've logged thousands of hours on this game and I suspect it won't get boring to me until I've logged thousands more.  I find this game extremely relaxing after a long day at work.  The graphics are great for when this game came out and the music is defiantly nice.  The achievements are challenging I hope to finish them all but some I very difficult to setup all the right things to obtain.  Overall I love this game and would recommend it to anyone that likes building towards victory.
9225,yes
9226,yeh it's aight
9227,good
9228,It's like Civ 4 but +1 gamer numbers instead.
9229,One more turn.....
9230,The kind of game you can play for 5+ hours straight and not even notice. The only gripe I have with this game is that the multiplayer is and always has been a bit buggy.
9231,Just one more turn... And four hours later....
9232,its good buy it
9233,"i didnt like it now i do
"
9234,I like all of the things
9235,"Excellent game, a lot of replayability."
9236,"So this is the best Civilization out there. With the expansions it is as complete as it gets. 
Easy to learn, difficult to master."
9237,"i recommend this game to you users because this game is a great way to spend your time, and its helps in training your brain. and it is known as the greatest strategy game ever created."
9238,"98/100
Türkiye'nin 2023 de Almanya'nın 1940 lar'da ABD'nin de ömür boyu hayallerini bu oyunda gerçekleştirip dünyayı fethedebilirsiniz. Şehir devletleri ile de iyi geçinmeyi unutmayın tüm dünyayı birbirine katabiliyorlar. Ve Sakın Catherine'ye kanmayın tam bir kurnazdır."
9239,"For me, this is the greatest Civilization game. Civ 6 may have new mechanics and more thing to do but this game has a maturity that makes it a legend. This game has perfect balance with the gameplay, AI and difficulty. Civ 6 is also a nice game but it still has some balace issues. Another reason why Civ 5 is better than 6 is, while you need to expand to compete with the others in Civ 6 (because production is everything), Civ 5 has a perfect happiness balace that allows you to play tall (have larger cities instead of more) and still be strong. Overall, this game is a legend. I love playing with my friends either online or with hotseat mode."
9240,"It takes a lot of time, critical thinking, and patience to complete a good and long game. Really satisfying when you when, depressing as hell when you lose. I highly recommend it and I think everyone who likes next-level strategy games should give it a shot."
9241,finally they made a map game so simple my dad could play it
9242,dddddddd
9243,the removal of several game items most notable the ww1 fighter an bomber along with religion and trade routes has made it very very very poor quality in my opinion at least. i will NEVER recommend this game to anyone. it is still a good game but with the loss of some of the best things i find i do not wish to play as much as before. until this is fixed i would say that as a game id give it negative points i do not recommend getting it
9244,"good
"
9245,Its still worth it 2.0
9246,Classic
9247,k
9248,Civ five is best civ game ever!

9251,"In what other game am I supposed to bitchslap the world through nuclear armageddon as Otto Von Bismark, huh?"
9252,Great game
9253,Just one more turn.
9254,The best Civ game
9255,Hot Stuff.

9258,Awesome strategy game
9259,Play it with Vox Populi installed: https://civ-5-cbp.fandom.com/wiki/Civ5_CBP_Wikia
9260,Addictive as crack! I've found myself staying up till 4 AM playing....
9261,so good that civ 6 didnt even sway me
9262,"The entire game is clunky and unresponsive. There is noticeable delay after every mouse and keyboard action. The gameplay is an oversimplified, tedious, grind with no sense of accomplishment or reward."
9263,"This game is really a mixed bag.

On the plus side, I like how it aims to be realistic and serious, more so than any other Civ game. I like how the leaders are presented and speak in their own languages during diplomacy, rather than looking like cartoon characters and making childish jokes. The game runs smoothly and seems mostly bug-free. The quality is good. In a way, the game is simple, but deep.

However, it gets kind of... bland... boring after awhile. Repetitive. Monotonous. The music isn't varied enough and it gets really irritating after a short time. The pace of the game is slow. It's not colorful and exciting. Diplomacy is horrible - denounce, denounce, denounce... sometimes the game feels like nothing but a series of denouncements over stupid things. Don't settle near me? Okay, fine. I'll settle in the opposite direction, miles and miles away from you... oops, it counted as a broken promise, because AI leaders are stupid enough to think the whole world belongs to them. The same leaders will hate you for warmongering, yet dogpile on some harmless little civ just because somebody denounced them for being weak. I'm kind of disappointed that after making so many Civ games, they put so much effort into presentation and mechanics but so little into diplomacy...

It's a decent game. I can still recommend it, but there are definitely things that annoy me. I feel that it made some positive steps up from Civ4, but also lost some of its magic and charm. Civ6 seems to be trying to bring that back, but I won't bother getting it for other reasons..."
9264,good game
9265,Wunderbar
9266,Adventure abounds in this fifth installment of this epic series. Steel thyself and prepare to ascend...
9267,Still a great game. Love it.

9271,yes
9272,"The best Civ game period, when you have a group of friends to play with honestly hours of fun and arguing and stuff. Broken and bugged to high hell and meh workshop support but is still a very good game and great game to start on the series."
9273,This is hands down one of my favorite games of all time.
9274,good
9275,One more turn please.
9276,good game i like
9277,"I have been playing civilization 1 to 6 (Now you can guess my age ...) and I have been a big fan of each of them, but civ 5 is one of the best."

9293,Game is gas I am much better at it than Zafar Khan.
9294,"Each game is a lot longer than i thought it would, be I am writing this review after 10 hours of gameplay and im still havent finished a single game. Still fun tho. I didn't think there would be other continents and I spent the first few thousand years not knowing that most of the other countries were across the ocean. So i guess it really made me feel like a person in the past. Pangaea FTW"
9295,Science is for losers.

9300,This game is wonderful.
9301,Freaking addict game. Be careful
9302,"The best within the Civilization franchise. The downside is the voice reading the quotes, it makes me want to sleep. And the religious quote. But the worst quote of all is the George W Bush's quote, I mean, just the fact of placing this guy in the game...
However, if you switch off the sound and do not read the quotes, this is the best Civilization ever. I wish it had the voice and quotes from Civilization IV."
9303,"Digital cocaine, can recommend"
9304,Play england and nuke france. Start a new game as england and nuke france again. They cry over fish in game too.
9305,"I have been playing Civilization since 1989, this version is the best so far (better than VI, I didn't like the district issues in that one). 
but I have some suggestions;
In a war , even a primitive warrior attacks a modern armour  they make at least 1 damage which doesn't make sense in real life, also for the air strikes a stealth bomber receives at least 1 damage even attacking an arcaic warrior."
9306,"You can get lost for hours playing this, and by hours I mean days. Could use more combat in some instances but you can play it however you like. Mods can definitely improve the game more to your liking (I like the world map and real world locations). However, I hate the AI. They can be...idiotic and quite annoying at times to put it mildly. Game works best playing with actual players."
9307,"I like the trading and the occurence of city-states and the political scheming that builds. I am still not too fond of the way the game handles AI interaction but it's still an improvement from earlier civ versions.
As a die hard CIV fan I've had many hours of lovely gaming with Civilization V"
9308,Good or I wouldn't be playing it......
9309,"This game got me to fail College 3 times, it's that good."
9310,.
9311,Better than all previous.
9312,"Get this game if you want to play a fun strategy game which is not that buggy and you like to build an empire. Unless you are a masochist and like having your money stolen from you dont get Civilization 6, Civ 5 is better in almost every regard. 

Also pro tip, play egypt and build every wonder. Your friends wont know what hit them."
9313,I like the selection of civilizations in this PC game. I have played over 500 hours at this point.
9314,"Love this game. 
"
9315,Ghandi
9316,It good.
9317,My play time say it all. Also recommend Civ 6. Game is great now
9318,"This game is really fun in singleplayer, but I wanna highlight something I feel not enough people talk about, that being the multiplayer. It  [i] really [/i] rocks.

It is so much fun playing mind games with other players in the same call, making threats (sometimes empty) at the placement of their towns, and working out alliances. It feels like a natural extension of the diplomacy mechanics already in place with the AI. It adds a new layer when you begin to think ""How can I exploit the AI"" to ""How can I get out of this cold war with the Incans controlled by a domineering player.

However, a huge, glaring issue that pops up in regards to the multiplayer is that if anyone, and I mean anyone, alt + tabs out of the window while a turn is ending and progressing through AI, the entire lobby will desync resulting in a frustrating change of hosts or general technical issues. My friends and I have looked hard for a solution, and so far all we know to do is to avoid multitasking. 

Great game, even better in multiplayer. 6 friends and a solid evening of playtime is some of the best fun I have had in a game with my friends. Highly recommended. The link to the PCGamingWiki article is  [url=https://www.pcgamingwiki.com/wiki/Civilization_V] here in case you wanted to tweak some things. [/url]"
9319,Love this game!
9320,fun game to play and beat all the way through. much better thank civ 6 imo
9321,Awesome game!
9322,what have I done
9323,You get to bully Polish people
9324,"This is a very dangerous game... I own no other game with the capacity to turn ""One more turn..."" into several hours of additional play. Enjoyable, throughout though, mind you.
Pros:
-Historical setting which gives the game an excellent atmosphere
-Addictive gameplay
-Wealth of civilizations, scenarios, units, and buildings
Cons:
-The AI is...poor. Higher difficulties have the AI cheat to keep up with the player.
-Gameplay can begin to feel same-y after long enough. Judging by my time played, though, it takes a while to kick in.
All told, I would probably still recommend it, despite its flaws."
9325,"I  like the different strategies  you can win with and the input from the dialog. I like this version more than the newer one because the workers do not expire after two jobs., however I plan on playing that as well more after I win on every difficulty level on this version."
9326,Have fun playing 50 hours straight for one multiplayer session
9327,"I haven't played much, but it's a nice game if you have a few extra minutes in your day."
9328,"One of my first strategy games for pc and probably one of my favorites. The ai interactions are fun while fighting, trading or even while building your massive turtle empire. The base game is fun but I would recommend purchasing the dlc bundle to get the full experience. Wonder building bonuses and social policies make your game different (assuming you're not just using the same civ over and over) almost every time you play. The skill ceiling for this game could probably prove to be pretty massive. The game has a few minor issues it runs into w/ multiplayer or having too many units but it all just comes down to syncing issues. Some of my favorite civs to play are the shoshone, venice, poland, germany, and boudicca. This game is difficult refreshing and time consuming. Play at your own risk; but know, its well worth it."
9329,best of the series.
9330,"Still best part of civilization ( and Call to power 2 also) 
Pros
1) no districts system, 
2) normal classic animation style (not like civ 6 mobile game style)
3) science, culture,  social policies better imho than civ 6 for example
4) lots of mods
etc."

This is one of my favorite games.

9363,if you love to think this is the game for you!
9364,shit game
9365,i never had any dlc for this game and i personally always found it to be the best game in the entire civ series. idk what it is but it isnt overly complicated and sits well with me because it's a game u can just pick up and get into whenever you're bored.
9366,Nice
9367,Really fun game. Would seriously recommend to people who are smart at strategy games...unlike me

9384,"I was introduced to Civilization V long after it was released, but I got immersed almost immediately. I have more hours in this game than any others, although I play Civ VI much more now. I made it my goal to win as every nation at least once. This challenge took me a long time, but because of the replayability of this game, I never got tired of playing. I think I enjoy Civ VI slightly more than Civ V, but it's close. If you're looking for an enjoyable Civ experience, but don't want to spend the money on the newest release, Civ V is a great choice!"

9388,great rts game but ai cheats lol
9389,"Civilization V plays much differently than other Civilizations.  You really have to be in love with the idea of building up, not out, in a 4X game.  This game punishes you economically, technologically, and culturally if you go beyond three to four cities.  If you were in love with the massive armies of previous Civs, that's gone completely.  One military unit per space.  This forces you to think a lot more tactically and value technological superiority.  
Pros:
Balance - I think this is the most gameplay balanced out of all 4x games I've ever played.
Visuals - For a 4x game, it is beautiful without being cluttered.
Cons:
Up-Not-Out - Domination victory types can actually become very difficult at a point.  I feel the play balance works well here, giving turtling and tech rushers a lead off of unit spam and conquest strats.  However, the penalty to conquest is very unique for a 4X and requires special skills to handle.
Limits on Wonders - There really needs to be a limit on world wonders for a given city.  Since the game punishes you hard for expansion, this is like the only playbalance issue.  CIV6 deals with it by forcing the wonder to take a space on the map.  Something like one world wonder per two citizens (round up) in a city would help here."
9390,its aight
9391,very good
9392,I love this game.  Only negative it has is that it's TOO addicting!  Hours can go by in a flash and you didn't realize you didn't sleep until sunlight shines through the cracks of your blinds.

9406,It's a fun game.
9407,"Amazing, Best Civ Game Yet"
9408,stupidly addicting... stay away for the sake of your life
9409,"big fun, much happy"
9410,What do you mean it's 2021?? it's 2010? I was only going to get that last city from Alexander...
9411,good
9412,"Haven't played a Civ game in years. I was a huge fan of Civ II and III. When playing Civ V for the first time, it felt immediately familiar while much more immersive. An excellent volume of the Civ canon."
9413,"It's Civilization, dummy, of course you want to"
9414,It's a great game and I recommend it to anyone who likes large-scale strategy/military games.
9415,Civilization
9416,Good game
9417,its called xcom squad capital rush
9418,2nd best type of fun you can have whilst playing with yourself
9419,Buggy as a shithouse rat
9420,Addictive similar to coke but cheaper
9421,Yeah I guess its alright.
9422,Interesting strategy game with multiple avenues of victory elements.  Many unique leaders and nation bonuses provide hours and hours of varied replay.
9423,"The 4X Strategy game to which all others must measure themselves to. not without its problems, but a very fun and infinitely replayable game."
9424,im in love with ghandi
9425,gppd fun 650 hours so far
9426,"its so good. dont play it, itll suck you in"
9427,"lost a friendship to this game, totally worth"
9428,plz nerf gandhi. he nuked me twice at least!!!!!!
9429,Chill Game
9430,"Civilian is a staple in the game industry and remains a great series with ups and downs.

Civilization V is one of the best games in the series for a lot of reasons.

NO UNIT STACKING! That's right, no more spam armies from other civilizations standing on one tile near your city. One unit per tile, so you have to actually plan out sieges, value your units and risk what units you are willing to lose on the front lines so the siege units can take position. 

MODDING! So many mods available for this game and the game does everything in it's power to make sure it's an easy process as it has a modding section on the main menu.

CITIES! Cities in this game are vertical which I am a fan of, unlike in Civilian VI. Some wonders will appear in your city but not everything you build will show up visually as the city cannot show 200 wonders on one tile. I have no problem with it, would rather use the land for farming/resources - but to each his own.

AI! AI in this game is pretty decent at combat. After you put days into this game, you will know how each AI civilization will play. I would 10/10 recommend you put on random personality traits for the AI so they are less predictable and more interesting.

In the end, this game is 7/10 without mods but would up it to a 9 or even a 10/10 with mods. Having mods to make the units look different based on their country, having a mod to have barbarians be able to capture/settle cities, etc - adds a lot more and new fun to the game.

TL;DR - If all I had was $30 to spend on stream forever, this would be a top pick."
9431,Civ 6 is a great game but the amount of content and depth in Civ 5 undeniably makes it a more deep game to play and really sink time into
9432,Good game
9433,Gud game
9434,"Great game if you need to kill 12 hours
"
9435,A nice 4X game to play with nice flavor and even read out texts that you can play on a low difficulty setting when you just want to build a - Civilization. It gets to simple though if you are used to Paradox Games.
9436,"the most buggy game I think I've played in a while.

constant issues that never seem to end.

on every computer and install I have played with.

actually unplayable.
"
9437,most based strategy game
9438,yes
9439,"Japan was nuked twice, classic move. Harald Bluetooth for the win"
9440,"Best game I've ever played, period! Skyrim is my runner up. Most accurate view, I think you will get 9/10 vanilla and 9.5/10 with mods. I have been playing Civ 5 for 3+ years on multiple accounts now... will never give a 10/10 unless it is flawless out the gate*. With both Civ 5 and Skyrim needing mods, it is a slight minus for me. Other than that, both are 10/10 without mods from me. Certain Mods elevate game play for me***."
9441,Look its just great.
9442,Great game and its really fun
9443,Chill game
9444,is gud play long tim
9445,.
9446,The gameplay and interface was beyond anything Aspyr had ever put forward and was leagues beyond what any other game of the time period had going for it.
9447,Best Civ game
9448,Still Better than Civ VI
9449,very good
9450,Sharted
9451,"Somewhat educational.
"
9452,My favorite of the Civilization series.
9453,Really addicting...
9454,"Loved that the fact it can be played on a Macbook
Sank hours and I dare say its more addictive than cocaine from a whores asshole.
4 hour per session and around 6 hours for a victory
If you like RTS games, this is for you"
9455,"no way guys, they just droped virtual crack"
9456,"Civilization found me.

I grew up playing Starcraft, Command & Conquer and Stronghold.
While this game doesn't give you the real time combat like those games can it makes up for it tenfold with the total immersion you'll soon find yourself in.

Not only do you have to focus on keeping strong borders with a strong army all while continually expanding your empire but you'll also need to determine the path your civilization takes in terms of research and culturally driven social policies, all of which give different individual benefits - did I also mention religion!?!?

I will admit I was very hesitant to try this game even though it came highly recommended, glad I finally did.
This game offers endless hours of fun and unlimited possibilities in regards to victory types, leaders, start location, etc..
If you're considering this game, just buy it - you will NOT regret it.

The play through can take a long while but with some adjustments to the settings you can edit the length it takes to complete structures, research new technology and complete culturally driven social policies. When you have a good understanding of this game you can play through a solo campaign with 10-12 AI leaders in roughly 3-4 hours depending on your efficiency. 

Folks say Monopoly ruins friendships, they've clearly never waged war on a friend in Civilization V.

- Pocatello"
9457,Its alright.
9458,"The game was great back in its day, How ever now its an unplayable mess! The game its self like to misplace 9 critical files every time you play it will misplace or corrupt these files making the game rendering to go haywire or up right crash. Not even validating the files will fix this and there are non-known ways to fix this since the files are hidden with in the game.
I can not recommend this game in its current state since it has been abandon and the only updates to come out for it (Rarely) seem to just brake the game even more trying to force you to buy there newer version which is a platform to steal information from you."
9459,"I've put 2500+ hours and I still suck

10/10"
9460,this is an amazing game for those in depth strategist but bare in mind like risk it is very time consuming
9461,"Very good strategy game. Bought everything on a package sale before. Civ 5 is 10 years old but its so good I see no need to get Civ 6 yet (or there hasn't been a good deal to get 6 yet). This is my first Civ game, and its easy to get into your elderly parents or young kiddos might enjoy this. In fact if this goes on sale again I'll buy it for my family. Makes learning history ang geography a bit more interactive."
9462,classic and great
9463,nuke
9464,VERY GOOD I LIKE TO PLAY THIS GAME I HAVE MUCH FUN VERY VERY GOOD I LIKE VERY MUCH WOULD RECOMMEND A LOT VERY MUCH YES YES >:O

9467,Terrible game
9468,"Great Game!
Never played any civ, glad I tried this one!"
9469,The game is inaccessible. I had at one point felt flow while playing though. The game is a seven out of ten.
9470,mid
9471,better than the 4th one i swear i've played this game
9472,"Classic game. Played hours of it online and in single player. Multiple adjustable settings allow you to play quick and or slower. Each civilization has their own perks and buffs to help make each game different and unique. Never gets old. 10 out of 10, would recommend playing."
9473,"Endless replayability, always something new to try, or a different angle to go after some objective.  The modding community also grows this ability even further.  Truly a great experience in my opinion.  Best turn based strategy game I have EVER played."
9474,Too addicating!
9475,almost as good as civ2
9476,good
9477,fun

9484,best game
9485,Best 4x game. Right balance of simple mechanics and complicated strategy. Lots of varied viable playstyles. Also the historical context/setting can lead to some hilariously ridiculous circumstances
9486,Very entertaining and challenging
9487,Addictive!!
9488,"Miitchell got greece and literally shit on america, unrealistic game"
9489,"Spent hours playing this game and the meticulousness and strategy necessary to build up your civilization is surprisingly satisfying! That being said, Ghandi is a real prick... lol"
9490,Feels like I've only played 92 hours
9491,LOVE IT
9492,"I have 74 hours and I've owned the game for like four days, worth every penny ten times over. Amazing with friends"

9497,nice game!
9498,"Really good, would have a trade agreement with England again 9/10"
9499,"The best 4X game of all time. Get Civ V with all dlc if you can, as the game is truly complete with it.
And I like Civ VI, but for some reason I find myself coming back to play this instead. I just have a ton of fun with this game and can't recommend it enough. Buy it!"
9500,Simple and fun
9501,Allway recomend Civilization got better every time
9502,Scratches that maximization itch
9503,awesome gameplay. I love everything about it
9504,"Very fun and interesting, great game to play with friends, kill time and test your brain and strategy skills. The idea is great, the gameplay is great, the game is great. Very iconic in my friend group despite only really play like 6 games together, the funny moments and memories, the memes... Its just all great!! However Civ 6 is out and is better but civ 5 is cheaper and still good."
9505,If you want to take over the world for hundreds of hours then this game is for you.
9506,noice
9507,"This was a rough start for me at the start, but am really liking the game now that I have had time to learn it"
9508,Mahatma Gandhi + nukes = OP
9509,this game is excellent. masterclass strategy game.
9510,one of the best versions of civilization.
9511,The only game i play once a week with a friend.
9512,I love this game. It is also so buggy. It's excruciating to put hours into a game and then have it break so that the game crashes on a specific turn. This has also been a known issue for YEARS. I won't buy the next game in the franchise because it just doesn't seem like the company cares to address these issues.
9513,"It's Civ 5. If you would enjoy a game like this, you've played it already. If you've been living under a rock for the past 10 years, this is a genre-defining strategy game. Just play it, and give it the time of day to show you what it's all about. It's a game that's worth putting your time into."
9514,computer board game
9515,solid fun game
9516,awful menu music
9517,"On Steam I have almost 900 hours on this game, and 10 years ago I had it before I had a steam account in proper and put probably more than 900 hours on it.  The fact that I have played nearly 2000 collective hours on Civ 5 and haven't even booted up Civ 6 should tell you everything - Civ 5 is just a damn amazing game.  No slight against Civ 6, but Civ 5 is just so dang good.  I'll probably be playing this game for the next 10 years as well, and I don't regret the last 10 at all.  
Love, Civ player since Civ III"
9518,dope game
9519,"In between surviving nursing school, this game kept me sane through the experience. There's something cathartic about stealing an enemy's city, razing it, and mocking them in the United Nations that neither therapy nor good marks in school can buy. Definitely would recommend this game if you're trying to escape life."
9520,Still better than Civ 6
9521,just one more turn. jk its cringe but i kinda like it????
9522,favorite turn based strategy game aside from Xcom
9523,Probably the best game in the series.  This version has balanced gameplay with great music.
9524,Cuz
9525,Amazing
9526,Much faster than the VI edition and the graphics are more classical.
9527,itz fun
9528,Good strat game
9529,"This game gives me a nice quite passtime to listen to some music, vibe and casually build my civilization up or to unleash the hounds of war and go to town on my enemies. I love how many ways you can play the game and how war tactics change as we progress through the scientific eras. The only thing that slightly ticks me off is how unreasonable the AIs in the game can be. They will declare war on you, get absolutely rekt, and then still have the audacity to ask for all your gold, resources and even your cities! Its like fighting a bunch of children."
9530,Amazing game
9531,"hours of fun, replayable, each countries leader has its own unique skills and units to give you an edge over your opponents, whether they be AI or other people is entirely up to you"
9532,"awsome even now its amazing :O
"
9533,Awesome game hours of entertainment. Easy to replay with different outcomes and challenges.
9534,"I didn't tried CIV 6 so it is today my only and active Civilization version. For more than 2 years I played vanilla version and several months before bought new DLC. Yesterday I won with Emperor and I think it is necessary to stop to waste time. Anyway the game is so great I don't know any other strategy I can be so deep in)))
There are some stupid things I hate like mosques building for christian religion (who made this???), great generals you don't need at the last 150 years (because you have 5 already), computers with same or greater level of science with 1 town when I have 10 science based, 3 warrior units of enemy you see at the third turn of the game (how he already made it???) and lots of more. Well, just to accept..."
9535,"Super fun, lose track of time so easily"
9536,Sick of those pesky weekends getting in the way of work days? Fire CIV 5 up and Voila! Problem solved.
9537,"After update game no longer works.
don't waste your money"
9538,cilivisasion
9539,"i have been playing civ since i first seen it as Civ2, its has only gotten better over time."
9540,"This is arguably the best turn based strategy war game that I've played.

My only real complaint is that I can't get achievements in multiplayer, which takes just as much time and effort as single player but also coordination."
9541,a good entry to civilization and a must play for fans of risk or other strategy or euro games!
9542,This game is a classic.
9543,"god game
"
9544,best game ever
9545,Wenous
9546,Slightly less cheraty tha later Civ or other 4X Games.  ngaging and challenging.
9547,"Fantastic game. Balanced, engaging, keeps you hooked! Very fulfilling :)"
9548,"Went from playing with my friends everyday to not having any friends to play with.... Made many enemies, great game"
9549,"An incredible game. start to finish. Yes, you have to suspend your sense of reality when you she archers take out tanks. that being said remember its a game and your are not the leader of some nation through the ages.  sit back and enjoy the ride and don't turn your back on the French or the Germans'. Heck don't turn your back PERIOD!"
9550,Lets take over the world!...Good game.
9551,I loved this game and really want to keep playing it but since I started using a 4k monitor the game just loads up into a tiny screen. Sadly I can't seem to find a way to fix the ratio for full screen without having the screen so small I need a magnifying glass to see it.
9552,it's my favorite game
9553,.
9554,I played it for a bit. Good game
9555,Still playing years later
9556,This is still by far the best Civ game released. Buy this over 6.
9557,install Vox Populi: https://forums.civfanatics.com/forums/community-patch-project.497/ and enjoy the game infinitely
9558,"best civ game 
addictive"
9559,"5 years of university did not prepare me for the sheer amount of stress this game has given me when every civ declares war on me at once

10/10 would pop a benny and turn my hair grey again"
9560,Good replayability.
9561,good
9562,I love the historical accuracy (kids can learn without even knowing!) and the turn-based play. It's easy to step away if/when you need to.
9563,Fantastic
9564,"The game can soft lock you at any point and fails to function at any level. Not to mention the truly abominable game design that can and will kill you cheaply and repeatedly such as enemies that sit on ledges blocking jumps and blind jumps to moving platforms that have zero indication on when and where they will stop.

On the first level, there are boxes that are supposed to be moved to complete a puzzle the grab button doesn't work you have to mash E to get it to work 1 in a 100 times and then repeat the proses to release it. Later on, you have to climb a massive string of moving blocks that are on random cycles so they may never line up and as I mentioned above they will change direction at any moment and drop you to your death.

On level 3 I was locked in a room with no way to progress because the wall jump doesn't work at all I tried for at least 20 min to get it to activate nothing. For fun I decided to look in the game files all the levels are right there so I renamed the files to skip the level and low and behold the wall jump starts working and also a double jump! I know its a Metroidvania but it never shows how to get new moves and you can soft lock if you don't have them if you enter the right room such as the tutorial stage right after you learn the down attack break the wood and WOW your stuck reset the game GG."
9565,"This game is a lot of fun. It has made me lose many days of productivity playing it. Its really simple to pick up, hard to master."
9566,entertaining
9567,yo
9568,Dudes is civ 5 like come on.
9569,An interesting and ever changing game. It is difficult to stick to one strategy as the tactical situation varies significantly from game to game. Great way to pass the time without the hassle of real time games requiring your constant attention.
9570,Perfect time waster. Easily lose track of time when playing before I know it 10+ hours pass and i'm still trying to win on the same civ.
9571,very cool computer game
9572,poggers
9573,Much better than Civ VI.
9574,If i ruled the world....
9575,"One of the best Civ games there is, and with mods it is just great."
9576,"POG, DRUGS MAKE IT BETTER THOUGH"
9577,"Fun and.. yeah, fun"
9578,Solid turn based strategy game. The benchmark.
9579,good
9580,"very nice, ne pas de problems"
9581,yooooo soo goood
9582,"Extremely addictive, buy knowing that once you start, there is no going back. You are now a Civ player."

9584,greaaaaaaat
9585,Solid game never gets boring
9586,Perfect
9587,i love this game
9588,gg
9589,i've loved all the civ games. Some more than others. This one was amazing and fun to play. Would like to see more updates but there aren't any more.

9593,What can I say that hasn't already been said? It's a classic and it's fun.
9594,"Yeah, Im taken... as a joke"
9595,good game
9596,Like Civ 6 but more playable.
9597,Yep!!!
9598,Do I really need to put in here why this game is great.
9599,"[h1] Full Review (go to TL;DR section if needed) [/h1]

[h2]Graphics[/h2]
Civ 5's graphics are pretty great. In this iteration of the Civ game, Aspyr went for a more realistic graphics style. Even though the tile's graphics didn't age incredibly, I still think they're bearable. Troop animations are very interesting, especially for infantry-style troops, which actually battle each other realistically. The only spot that troop animations are lacking are in both naval and aviary troops. Planes take an excruciatingly long time to execute bombings, and naval troops don't have much animation at all. The place where these game's graphic shine is definitely in the leader animations. Whenever you meet with a leader in-game, there is a fully-animated leader to talk to and read facial expressions from. They even are in lush environments! It's honestly a treat when playing the game to see new leaders' environments. To add to this, the menus and UI are all very intuitive, with a nice artstlyle for the logos for troops and whatnot. Overall, very nice graphics.
[h2]Gameplay[/h2]
What can I say? You know it. You love it. It's Civilization gameplay. If you didn't know, in Civ 5, you start out with just a settler and a warrior to your name. You found a city, start researching technology that allows you to produce units and buildings, explore, and more! Eventually, you meet other civs, which you can either be diplomatic with or just go to nuclear war with them. Gameplay is quite balanced, though the AI is pretty good at best and really stupid at worst. It is surprising that, after 5 games, we still don't have half-decent computer players. With the addition of an incredible workshop mode for custom civs, maps, and even full mods, this game has near infinite replayability.
[h2]Audio[/h2]
This game's soundtrack is incredible. From the title screen, big, booming orchestral scores fill your ears. Even in game, there is always a movie-like soundtrack playing, which usuallys feels exactly like how the game is going. You're in war? Soundtrack is tense and foreboding. Golden age? Nice, calming, exciting track. It's rather insane how professional the music sounds. 
[h2]Audience[/h2]
Not much to say here. Because of the complexity and strategy of the game, younger kids will probably enjoy Civ 5 less than teens/adults, but its maturity is fine for all ages.
[h2]PC Requirements[/h2]
You could run this on a Chromebook. (for specifics, check the game's store page.)
[h2]Difficulty[/h2]
Not terrible on most difficulty levels. What really annoys me is that For the higher up difficulties, the game just straight up gives advantages to the AI players, creating very frustrating artificial difficulty. Just make better AI for pete's sake (I know that's not an easy task, but at least make the effort)!
[h2]Grind[/h2]
I mean, there is nothing in-game to unlock, but there is a LUDICROUS amount of achievements.
[h2]Story[/h2]
No story here. Make your own!
[h2]Play Time[/h2]-
A TON of replayability, simply because of all the leader choices, all with their own unique bonuses making you play in vastly different ways.
[h2]Price[/h2]
30 bucks is a great price, but I STRONGLY suggest saving up for the complete edition. You get the two main expansions which add sooo much to the game AND all the smaller dlc packs. It's a bargain.

[h2]Bugs[/h2]
Not many, honestly. Only minor ones.

[h1] TL;DR [/h1]

Sid Meier's Civilization V is a great addition to the series, adding many new features and leaders. Its graphics and and soundtracks are great, it has a ton of replayability, and the complete edition is a steal. If you like strategy games, this will be one of your favorites. Civ 5 is a gold standard in tile-based strategy games. The real question you probably care about is - is this game better than Civ 6? The answer is yes. Very much yes.

9638,I click the shiny buttons.
9639,I find this game relaxing after a long day at work. It's a great way to decompress after a hard day of customer service. Declaring war is great for alleviating aggravation and frustration too...
9640,IN-BLOODY-CREDIBLE
9641,its cool
9642,"My favorite of the series since civ 3. I think I am going to skip civ 6. 

I dunno what to say after 1K hours. At this point the things that annoy me are UI and game mechanics that make the game slow.

For example I don't need to have the screen take over each and every time the next civ and their momma wants to denounce me. Just keep to a corner screen or some short message. Keep the game moving, stop-stopping the game to let the AI vent at me. I think more information about the AI needs to be put in front of the player, without menues. Maybe one page should have all the details I would need about each CIV. 

To me the biggest issue is AI, I wouldn't worry about anything in the next game, art direction, civs, anything until that AI is better at running the game. Even if it takes years, this game needs better AI. Giving the AI extra units at the start is the same as being a bullet spunge. To me the core of the game, the prize pony is how well the AI can work the game."

9645,.
9646,Still best Civ game to this day
9647,its AWSOME if you dont own it buy it and play it
9648,Although i have only just finished my first game on quick it was a lot of fun. So far I can not see too many issues.
9649,"""i think i will nuke him again"" Ghandi, Turn 137"
9650,"It's probably the best of the Civ series. Great time waster. Sometimes educational. Civ6 is not just worse gameplay wise but also crashes a lot. This one is worth it's price, especially if you snag it on sale w the expansions."
9651,very big maP!
9652,"I used to have friends. I don't anymore. The part of this sentence that is missing is Sid Meier's Civilization V, and this is the end of the paragraph."
9653,ha ha weed
9654,"My go-to strategy game. Games are long but rewarding, with infinite possibilities of outcomes. Fun to play alone, Even more fun with a few friends. Never trust The Aztecs."
9655,"This game is majestic.
HOTSEAT is a time killer, you will wake up hours later still playing without realizing 10h passed. I am sticking to this, I DO NOT LIKE the fortnite CIV 6 graphics, so yeah this game is just way better, no reason to get the 6th. Hoping 7 will be back to its roots"
9656,this game is really good
9657,"exellent game, well worth the price, dont play it"
9658,"Great time sink, entertaining and a good challenge for all to be had."
9659,
9660,Great job 10/10 would play again
9661,Very good game
9662,Poggers
9663,Game plays nicely and people that have never seen it played can jump in easily
9664,Civ V go brrrt
9665,Everything that Civ 6 wishes it was.
9666,"Tremendous, classic game.  However, it has a tendency to crash unexpectedly as the game climbs into the higher turn count.  Sometimes you can get your game back via reloading autosave or regular save, other times it won't run from that point on again.  That being said-- it's still a tremendous game."
9667,"well if you like civilization then maybe you would also enjoy playing around with it...go full dictator and kill who you wish,go murder innocent workers with zero consequences ...how i love civilization......at least my civilization."
9668,Still a stunner
9669,amazing
9670,its good many countries
9671,A must have classic
9672,I love this game so much
9673,its ok
9674,Es la raja
9675,I Initially got this gifted to me by a friend and had no idea how to play. It took time to understand it but once i understood i ended up playing it SO MUCH. it's actually ridiculous how long ive played it. I could be playing the game and 7 hours magically have flown by. 11/8 would recommend if you wanna learn how to monopolize the world
9676,"The best 4X game I have ever played, if it included the time when I *cough* pirated it *cough* my time played would at the least be doubled."
9677,"best strategy game ever
"
9678,A good time waster
9679,great game
9680,By far the best turn based strategy game I've played. ( Also still a better version than VI).
9681,It is Civ.
9682,its worth playing
9683,grate time killer
9684,"I am surprised to see that I had not written a review for this yet lol.

This game is great with high amounts of variability when it comes to enemies, maps, endings, etc. Plus you can set a max turn limit or change the speed of the game so that it may fit what time constraints you have. Personally I like to play really long games for hours on end and if I do not finish that night I play it the next night. Overall love this game and keep coming back to get a few matches in. With that in mind I do not play very many of the online multiplayer matches but of those I have played the people seem rather chill and fun to play with.

Personally recommend this one over Civ 6 as the gameplay is much more fun with your only down side being the slightly worse graphics, not that you're really gonna notice."
9685,Great!
9686,"This game is literally PERFECT. Don't like to micromanage? Got you covered. Wanna micromanage freaking everything? Yup, there too. I'm sure I'm not alone in reminiscing hours-long games of Civ with the buddies. This game has a little bit of everything for everyone. If you call yourself a fan of strategy games but haven't played this game, its WAY past due. You won't regret it."
9687,"This was the first Civilization game I played, and I loved it. There are important aspects to know about it for you:
- It is vast, has a huge replay value, and a lot to explore, re-explore, re-do, re-try, master
- Multiplayer with friends is really good, but it might not be as good with others
- You'll actually learn a thing or two
- It can be relaxing or very challenging, so it can fit your mood well
Make sure to go with the expansions, as they add amazing aspects. I truly do not have important negative aspects for this game. 300+ is by far the most hours I have in one game, and for good reason."
9688,gud
9689,cool
9690,good
9691,Entertaining but the cheating AI kinda ruins it for me. Your mileage may vary
9692,fantastic - makes ya thimk

9700,Good to play if you enjoy wasting time.
9701,great game
9702,"The biggest flaw in Civ 5 is that world domination is much more fun than any other victory choice

But that's pretty much... the only flaw.

It's a good game, what can I say?"
9703,.
9704,g00d game xD
9705,best game of all time
9706,"The game is good, however if you're turn based strategy veteran you'll soon find the AI is... pretty bad, and higher difficulty levels only give it more resources while not making it any smarter. But do not despair! Install Vox Populi mod and this game becomes 20 times better."
9707,Yes
9708,Quite good
9709,Very Fun
9710,Just..one....more...turn...
9711,everything
9712,I play on Warlord and I still lose to the Iroquois
9713,game has always slapped
9714,"I have played many an hour within this game, it can eat the hours away with joy and you may wonder where the time went.. only thing i can say is.. time flies when you have fun :) 
one of my fav civs.."
9715,"Playing on high difficulty the AI are a bunch of assholes. Better with friends obviously but still fun regardless. 
Gandhi Best Girl."
9716,better than 6 imo.
9717,"like
"
9718,Great map based strategy game.
9719,It's good.
9720,It's literally the best.
9721,good game
9722,i really enjoy this game. The only downside is you can't play with people who have Pc if you have a mac computer. if they corrected it this would be a near perfect game.
9723,Don't get this game if you have a life
9724,"one more turn

(one more turn)"
9725,pretty good
9726,Great game. one of the best.
9727,fun
9728,
9729,"you sre good at selling games back unresponsive to questions after purchase
"
9730,Great simple to learn yet difficult to master gameplay
9731,Enjoyed playing this game for hours together with my kids among our at home activities
9732,"it very good
"
9733,"Liked - Everything
Disliked - Optimization with OS (very minor gripe, I love this game)"
9734,built great wall as elizabeth - 10/10 realistic
9735,Good game. Better than Civ 6
9736,"The ultimate pinnacle in the world of strategy gaming. I'd recommend this gaming experience to all strategy enthusiasts of any level of expertise. Want to take your first jump into the world of strategy? This is the game for you. Already mastered every other game on the market? This is the game for you. No matter how many times I play I keep coming back for more, because there's always more to be offered. 10/10 will play forever, 3 Michelin Stars, 100% on Rotten Tomatoes, Oscar Winner of Best Picture, Medal of Honor, 2 enthusiastic thumbs up."
9737,been playing this game since I was 11 and I still learn new things every day. truly a masterclass in RTS
9738,"Lots of choices, so many choices that there's always an excuse to start another game!  I have yet to experience any game play issues, even with the game minimized on & off for days at a time.  Good value, great title!"
9739,I like this game because I take a lot of adderall.  Its fun.  Inspired me to read Sun Zu's The Art of War.  It has built my skill up in the game.
9740,"Civ V is the classic Civilization game and I would recommend it to anyone. If you like board games that involve strategy, like Catan, you will love this game. I would describe it like a turn based Age of Empires. It is also has many expansion pack which really flesh out the game and are totally worth it. I recommend playing the base game and then once you get bored, get Brave New World. Soundtrack is also amazing."
9741,"Get the community patch (a mod), and then it gives you a good challenge."
9742,Wait! just one more turn.
9743,better than civ 6
9744,gg
9745,good
9746,Ez Gandhi CPU Win
9747,Civ 5 is the perfect way to waste an hour which quickly turns into an entire weekend. It's like Risk if Risk was fun!
9748,Good Game
9749,"To say this game hooks you is a as fine an understatement I can manage, but.... just wait a sec, just one more turn, then I will finish this review"
9750,"A lot of fun, very comforting game. I play this all the time if i am stressed."
9751,its fun. i really like it.
9752,"in the turn based game world as always Civ 5 is a 9.9, only issue I have with the game is it selects a unit for you and if you're selecting units and clicking fast, it'll switch a unit under control and you move wrong. I'm sure there is a way to turn that off, but I've been playing 2 days and haven't tried to figure that out yet. What amazes me, is, I took england clear off the map, got the accomplishment and it says only 58% of the players accomplish that??? that's kind of the objective, I guess the new breed of gamers like to use the alternate means of winning games...."
9753,gud game
9754,its a good civ game
9755,Great game. 69 hours on this account. Haha funny number. Great game. :) Fuck Civ 6
9756,It good
9757,amaizing
9758,Incredible
9759,It's a fun game. Even all these years later.
9760,good
9761,a classic thats still good to this day
9762,Fun and relaxing but just imagine if the AI was smart...
9763,"This game is crack! Repeatedly I'm telling myself, ""Okay, one more turn, one more turn, one more turn."" It's so fun!"
9764,Great game!!!
9765,Good game. Would play again... and again... and again...
9766,"solid base game, but after about 600 hours i started heavily modding it and can barely go back"
9767,yessir
9768,good edition of the game. takes some getting used to its own special ways but lots of fun. if you like other civ games you will probably like this one.
9769,"This game is HIGHLY addictive!  Set an alarm if you need to do anything, like be at work.  Or eat, or sleep..."
9770,Thanks for the civ game Sid
9771,itts good buy it
9772,"Very good game, better than Civ 6."
9773,"Good fun to burn a day or two in, even years after its release and subsequent DLC/updates"
9774,One of the best strategy games of all time.
9775,"Really good, the more you play the more you learn."
9776,"I have a few complaints about this game:

1) The spying mechanics are weak and too easily removed as a whole.  Once you lose a spy, you can never replace them, and can only get a total of five or six spies throughout the entire game.  It's possible to only ever manage three spies throughout your game, and for them to die, and then you just have no spies-- forever.

2) The AI cheats -ridiculously-.  Of all the unbelievable non-sense they do, three bother me more than anything: 

a) Magic barbarians - Barbarian units will simply spawn anywhere you don't have constant vision, and frequently ""conveniently"" happen to have positioning in the exact spot they need, to capture your vulnerable units-- which they seem to always know precisely where those units are, and the exact path they need to take through vision you don't have, in order to capture those units.  Either that, or they're simply spawning units beside your vulnerable units in your lack of vision.  Either way, they'd have to use magic to accomplish it.  They also have a tendency to co-ordinate their attacks against you when another Civ attacks you.  This one isn't completely unreasonable, as that would be an intelligent way to exploit an enemy's weakness, but I can't tell you how many times I've watched them ignore my enemy AI Civs' units to make a bee-line toward mine, and help my enemies as if they were those CIvs' units.

b) City-states you go to war with also seem to be able to magically spawn units anywhere near their city in which you don't have line of sight.  They also seem to suddenly and magically possess far more resources (for fending you off) the moment you attack them than they would exhibit throughout the entire course of the game if you don't.  (Particularly if an enemy Civ attacks them.)

c) Enemy AI Civs seems to always have a 100% perfect picture of everything on the map, including your line of sight, which they constantly exploit.  Likewise, they always seem to know what Wonders you're building and will -very frequently- poach it out from under you, 1-3 turns before you complete it, regardless of how many wonder-building bonuses you have or how quickly you bee-lined your way to the technology required to build those wonders.   I've even had this happen when building a wonder with an engineer, who can be used to fully finish most wonders in a single turn.  That's right: the enemy AI Civs can build wonders faster than *instantly*.  


Despite all that however, the game is tons of fun.  The variety of Civs and their different bonuses gives the game hundreds of hours of replayability, and if you're playing with real life people online and remove all the AI, it completely changes the game and turns it into an infinitely more interesting version of chess.  

There are four major branches of paths you can take to win the game (Culture, Military, Science, or Diplomacy) and two additional branches you can weave into those for added twists and bonuses (religion, economics).  

One thing I love in particular about this game, is that it's entirely viable as a strategy to either go completely peaceful (and win), completely military (and win), or any mix of mostly peaceful / mostly war-like, and pull out a victory!  The diplomacy menu even with the AI is actually fun and surprisingly reasonable a lot of the time.  

Almost nothing in this game is reliant on a chance factor, practically everything is up to your strategy and tactics.

A massive roster of additional Civs have been added for the ""Complete"" edition, as well as wonders, unique units, and playable maps.  

If you enjoy turn-based strategy, there's not much better out there than the Civ series, and this one in particular.  I dare say this is one of the best games ever made, of any genre."
9777,i like is fun graphics good specially boats insert smiley face here
9778,Big Think
9779,"Better than civ 6, the depth in this game is incredibly in depth and for the most part pretty well balanced.  After playing this game for nearly 250 hours I still find the need to play this game for hour on end. If you are looking for a good start game to sink a decent amount of hours into this game I would highly consider."
9780,my favorite turn based strategy game for pc along with xcom and axis and allies
9781,love all the civ titles
9782,good
9783,"For me its the best Civ. The developers should make more content for this game, it is amazing and could be even better."
9784,Still better than Civ 6!
9785,it's okay
9786,amazingly fun
9787,incredible game
9788,Very engaging strategy game. Fun to play alone as well as with others
9789,I found Rome a city of marble and left it a pile of radioactive rubble.
9790,"Overall excellent entry in the Civ series. Even with Civ VI, I still find myself coming back here from time to time."
9791,gyd geym
9792,"i usually dont like these type of games but i find myself coming back to this, its great"
9793,Fun strategy based game that you can easily lose hours of time playing. This is especially so during times of peak procrastination. For example currently I am supposed to be learning about helicopter flight systems and yet here I am writing this review.
9794,!
9795,Just... one more turn...
9796,"Civ is a really fun game to play, even if I never play it higher than like a level 2 difficulty.  I enjoy making giant nations, lots of friends, and then taking over my neighbors once they start complaining too much.  XD"
9797,gordon
9798,Amazing
9799,Fun
9800,"Totally useless  - the advisor keeps saying @build a city soon'  the help says "" a build city icon will appear when the settler unit is on a suitable site  - despirte checking every possible hex - the build city option never appears"
9801,Best game
9802,ONE OF IF NOT THE BEST GAMES TO SIT AND PLAY EVER MADE!
9803,"I was never really into these strategy Risk-like games but decided to give this one a shot. One of the greatest deals i could ev er get for a cheap and reduced price. This game is very interesting and fun to play either by yourself or with friends. If you've wanted to give one of these games a try, i recommend wholeheartedly starting here. One note tho, only mac players can play with other mac players because of the build. Regardless, if you have some serious time to kill (like seriously because this game will drain your time, it's that addictive!) I say buy the entire game with dlc's on a nice deal."
9804,ye
9805,"Some people put thousands of hours into this game, and for good reason. Lots of ways to play, lots of civs to try, and lots of skill to develop. Probably a 10/10, and the best civ game all-around"
9806,Fantastic game
9807,Very good strategy game with many variations of play and victory.  Try not to get too addcted!
9808,"around 170 hours played,

enough said"
9809,This game has been a ride or die for me for years. Highly recommend. Vastly prefer this one to the newer version.
9810,"Been a fan since original launch, looking forward to the next launch..  Played this darn thing over 30 years now."
9811,Gud
9812,Those poor bastards who started with civ 6
9813,It's an awesome game with a multitude of ways to play whether it be scenarios or customized games for you to play. It's always fun and you never play the same game twice.
9814,Not too shabby.
9815,"it took me 7 years to beat my first civ game, would reccomend"
9816,"Good game to play while you're doing other things, provided you dont get sucked in too much
"
9817,I like turn based games
9818,ah yes it seems i have made a 'civilization five' as they said in the great greek halls
9819,I love this game. Its fun to play against/ with friends or just on your own. I like that you can speed up time and travel with your country through the ages. Its compact enough to play from time to time or for hours straight and you never feel like you're missing out if life gets super busy now and then. I definitely recommend.
9820,Its ok
9821,"IMO best civ game EVER! It does have a steep learning curve but once you get past that, this game has amazing replay value and some great community content"
9822,Wanna become Mein Fuhrer? do it here.
9823,The only dislike I have is that I do not have too much time to play.
9824,"Pretty good time sink for casual games with no general direction, but also provides the depth to ensure lasting replayability a million times over. 10/10 would play 1 whole game of civ again"
9825,apple juice
9826,"Thanks to the MPP patch, which lets you play multiplayer with mods, and mods in general, this is one of the best civ games. it could be improved with better graphics and a cleaner interface, and possibly a government system like in civ 6, which adds a lot more depth to one's civilization."
9827,I need help
9828,"great game, I will for sure play more"
9829,gg ez
9830,Better than civ 6 when it first came out
9831,One of the best!!!!!!!
9832,its addicting
9833,Still fun after all this time. I regularly play it while listening to podcasts.
9834,Good
9835,This is a very challenging strategy game with a large variety of winning possibilities. Best suited for patient players. Speed is not required since it is turn based. Still it is as exciting as it can get!
9836,"I LOVE THIS GAME, IT MAKES ME HAPPY <3<3<3<3"
9837,"best civ game yet, can't wait to finally defeat genghis khan!"
9838,i love this game
9839,It's fun.
9840,"this is lots of fun
"
9841,"I think this would have been a very different review if it weren't for the wonderful person/people responsible for  the MPPatch fix that allows you to play with mods on multiplayer. 
But because of this addition, and the mods Less religious religions, and the Extra-slow Research Mod by Ellye, this has become without question my favourite Civ game. Thank you so much to the people who do the work that the game makers seem to over look. So, so much better."
9842,sucks
9843,"Endless replayability, well rounded game"
9844,"Its not always fun, and i struggle a lot cause i have a smooth brain, but when im in the mood for some world domination, until i have the means for the real deal, this hits the spot!"
9845,Just so fun. Love the strategy. Multiplay is glitchy af
9846,"Epic & Flawed:

Steam asked me if I would like to revise after playing another game. I will, but it's not better. One more pro and a lot more cons, including a big one: 

Big Con: As you reach the endgame the game often crashes on loading. Even if it does load, some graphics, like farms, vanish from the map. Makes it hard to see what needs development and what doesn't. And my system is WAY above the recommended (Ryzen 7, 8-cores, 64 gb RAM, 3gb GPU.)

This is not a terrible game, but I would not recommend buying at full price, or even 50% off. Wait for a real sale! I go all the way back to Civ I in 1991. I expect each new installment to retain the good of the previous ones and then get better. Civ II was maybe the best (bring it to Steam!) Civ III and Civ IV had issues, but continued to add to the franchise. Civ V does too, but it also loses a lot and has too many flaws to give it an enthusiastic endorsement. There are some great Pros, but simply too many Cons! 

Pros:
-Improved strategic resources. Now you need quantity and not just access. 1 Oil allows one tank unit, not a million. 
-City States: these minor allies are great. Trade, ally, or conquer them. So much fun! Best new idea.
-Cleaner. You no longer need roads to maximize every tile, just to connect cities. Also, limited stacking (and resources) means no more mega-stacks of units to manage. Much less micromanagement. 
-The tile square cross has been replaced with a hexagon system that allows for much bigger and epic cities.
-Loads of wonders and buildings.
-You can design your own religions and doctrines. This works well. 
-Simple ideologies replaced with doctrine trees (but they are linear, unlike religion.) Matters a lot at the beginning, less over time. 
-Archaeology. Dig up and benefit from your own past. Fun! 
-Cities now have intrinsic defenses, reducing the need to tie-up troops in garrisons. 
-Can start a standard game with limited victory conditions (I hated that you couldn't in Civ 4. Had to use editor.) The trade-off is no custom designed games (maps, units, etc.) 
-Foreign Legionnaires. Why don't more games have these? 

Cons:
-AI is stupid. In building it heavily favors trading posts (gold/science) over food and production. In combat it tends to maneuver at all costs to avoid bad terrain, even if it means taking defensive fire for an extra turn before attacking. At a certain level, when the AI does attack, it just suicides units against well-defended positions. 
-No more animations. Beginning with Civ 2 the series kept trying to animate techs, wonders, and accomplishments. Not here. You get still art pieces of most of these. Way less visual then Civ 4. Spaceship launch (no building images) is really lame.) For new Art/Music pieces you get a still of a famous art work. but the same chamber orchestra for music (no matter genre) and a short MP3 clip. Boring.
-Art/Music/Artifacts. You can now fill museums, opera houses, etc. and get minor game advantages. You can stack these for bonuses, but how you do this is rather opaque. I suppose some players will enjoy managing their collections, trying to match the right great works together for a +2 culture score. 
-Wonders are not that wonderful. Remember when one big dam could power a continent? No more. Wonder effects are much more abstract and local, usually a few added points of culture, faith, etc. 
-No internal game editor. You can apparently do mods outside, but if you want to changes terrain or conditions, sorry. Civ has had editors since Civ 2. So what's up here? 
-Units. So these are pretty standard, until,,, Giant Death Robots and X-com (Enemy Unknown) Squads! WTH??? Just a little cross-game advertising. And maybe just a little bit over the top? 
-Espionage was overpowered in Civ 4:BTS. Here it is really a waste. You can steal tech (if you need it) but no sabotage or subversion. Mostly you can see other cities and learn who's plotting against who,
-Diplomacy is almost pointless. You can trade resources, but no allies. Only ""friends."" AI denounces you for almost anything. And it is also stupid. A civ stuck in the Middle Ages will actually threaten you and your minor allies, and if you complain it will dare you to do something about it, even if you have Nukes and 30 cities and they have crossbows and only 6! There is no logical mechanism here. 
-Trade routes are now caravans and ships to other cities for money and to spread religion and influence. They do have to be managed all the time. It's a little annoying. 

I own Civ 5, and will continue to play it, but I have to admit to disappointment. It did fix some things that Civ 4 (and 3) got wrong, like the fixed victory conditions in non-custom games and excess unit management. Some new concepts worked (City-States, Archaeology) while others need work (art/music.) But it also took too much out like WOW graphics and animations, and an in-game editor. It is visually bland and, as mentioned, the AI needs work. Watching AI units take hits for a couple turns just to avoid attacking across a river, even with overwhelming odds, is just buggy to watch. 

Bottom line: It's an OK game, but in a franchise series you always expect #X+1 to clearly exceed X. This one didn't make it! I'll wait for 6 to go on super sale.

9847,It sucks you in and never lets you out.
9848,"Awesome, already have 11 hours in after only 3 days."
9849,"This review has been turned to NEGATIVE in light of the new 2K Launcher that has made the game literally unplayable. Modded or unmodded you can't even launch the game anymore, the only point of the new launcher was to advertise 2K's other products and encourage you to buy directly through them and not Steam. There's no Mods option on the new launcher for games where most of the appeal and replayability comes from the modding community...but even that aside, YOU CAN'T PLAY THE GAME!!! It's not just this game either, many 2K games are facing this same problem from this horrible launcher: XCOM, Civilization, etc.

I will return my reviews to their previous thumbs ups when the launcher has been rolled back! I will not be purchasing ANYTHING related to 2K until then.

--------------------------------"
9850,"I love Civilization, all volumes offer great game-play and superb story lines."
9851,The best Civ game ever made.
9852,One of the most enjoyable games I've played
9853,It's ok.
9854,my favorite game of all time
9855,Great game with insane depth to it. Took me a while to really understand how to appropriately set up my cities and decide which victory types I enjoy. Would recommend.
9856,
9857,"Right, not much to say that hasn't been said before. I bought this game on release. Put in 894 hours since then. Like strategy? Buy it. Like history? Also Buy it. Develop ""One more Turn"" syndrome and become a Civ addict."
9858,"Excellent game, must try this game ..very cheap and many features with the bundle."
9859,Gandhi got nukes and bombed everyone.
9860,fun and mango
9861,"Probably my favorite Civilization out of the whole series thus far. Lots of great graphical and gameplay improvements, the hex map system is an innovative change, and I like the policy branching. Soundtrack is stellar. Highly recommended!"
9862,I like this version better than Civilization VI. Easy to get started & very fun to play.
9863,.
9864,Fun game
9865,"easily the best sky view strategy out there. Dont play this at work or in class though, it will suck you in without a doubt. however, this game is a pretty difficult game and it will take some time to both learn, and increase difficulty levels. If you're just starting out, definitely start with beginner mode and do not make the mistake of starting at medium like the gorgeous dumb dumb I am. Also theres a glitch in the game with workers sometimes not completely fulfilling their tasks without you spamming the same work order every turn, but it fixes itself with the Gods and Kings DLC. Not a huge deal but it is kind of annoying when youre at war with another civ.

Side note: the only worth while DLC in my opinion is the Gods and Kings DLC as it adds a new resource called ""Faith"" and you gain the ability to use more Civs with cool and different buffs."
9866,One more turn ..
9867,my favourite version of CIV!
9868,"Favorite game of all time. Easy to play, near impossible to master. The perfect balance of complexity and game speed. This game is master work. Buy it, now."
9869,Dont start playing past 12pm.
9870,"its great to get away from the real world and into something else you can try to build better
"
9871,It's Civ. Play the damn game.
9872,communist france fighting off the indonesian empire and protecting its island capital has never been more fun !
9873,this is a must.
9874,i like it
9875,game bad
9876,Pretty good
9877,An enjoyable way to spend time.
9878,"Strategic, Realistic, and insanely fun and addicting."
9879,good.
9880,A good way to express your feelings against your friends
9881,"A great strategy game for people like me who don't enjoy the nitpicky micromanaging found in most other games within the genre. Despite being simpler there are plenty of choices to make, and the combat is still really REALLY fun. Whether you're taking over the world or going for a peaceful victory, you'll be saying ""Just one more turn"" until the whole day has passed you by."
9882,You can't get tired of this incredible game ! I have played over a thousand hours and the excitement still remains !
9883,It's Civ. I don't even know why you're reading this review. Just go play the game. It's amazing.
9884,it is fun
9885,Really great game they do updates and add new things to keep the game fun and new.
9886,"The best of the Civilization franchise. No tedious districts and no workers that vanish after building a few farms. DLC expands upon the base game nicely and is well-integrated, and map packs are great if you get bored of the default continents map. 10/10 get it!"
9887,Last of the good old Civ games
9888,.
9889,"I've played all the Civ games from Civ 1 to Civ 6 and variants. Civ 5 BNW is, in my opinion, the most complete version and the games are fairly interesting start to finish."
9890,Reject humanity. Return to nukes
9891,"I've played this game for 1000+ hours for a reason, let's leave it at that"
9892,ultimate strategy
9893,good game
9894,They should put crack addicts on this game to cure their addiction
9895,FUCKIN LOVE THIS GAME. POLAND IS THE SHIT.
9896,"I enjoyed Civ 6 from epic games and heard that Civ 5 was a lot better, so I got this game for like 9 bucks with all of it's dlc, and it's not disappointing in the slightest. I like the cartoony feel of Civ 6 a lot more, and a few of the gameplay aspects like the card system, but Civ 5's settings are definitely a lot better imo such as unlimited builder use and you're not held back by districts and needing populations to build them. Then again, that aspect was a little nice touch in 6 where your cities need strategies and whatnot. Anyways, if you like Civ 6 like me, this is a nice game to get, especially with the increased mod support."
9897,"Best game on Steam. Never gets old, been playing for over 5 years. Best Civ out of all of them."
9898,DaBaby
9899,"Ive had this on the app store since 2015 and only recently migrated to steam, (logged about 600 hours there) This is an absolutely spectacular game. 9.5/10 imo, have fun gamers"
9900,all of it love it
9901,its gud
9902,"Hmmmmm, its a buy! :)"
9903,makes you think alot
9904,supper bad it doesnt makm any sens
9905,"I've been playing the series since the beginning, and this is the best iteration since Civ II. Don't hesitate if it's on sale, it still stands up very well all these years later. Looks great in ultrawide. Be prepared to forgo the rest of your life for a while, though. Have fun!"
9906,Play with No Quitters mod for competitive multiplayer games. Look up mod on google.
9907,"This game is great when it is not broken.

1/10 for tech support, really. The Indian scammers do better.

9/10 for gameplay. It is still better than CIV VI.

What's up with this game being great? Idk..

Maybe the fact you can play germany and do what Germany wasn't able to achieve 100 years ago? 

Maybe because you think it should be WE rather than I?

Maybe because you like Nukes? Or maybe because you like city management with dumb AI that offers you worse deals than the EU and NATO together (I am talking about the UK here!)

Whatever you do with this game is up to you. Just kill ghandi on sight and you will be fine. Or be Ghandi and get perished. Also pretty cool to be neighbours with Indonesia who happens to have the ability to attack twice in 1 turn."
9908,yes
9909,"Cuppla hours under me belt. Good game, worth the punt if you are interested."
9910,"I'm going to just play for a couple hours. Just a quick game.
*15 hours and 300 turns later*
Okay just gonna upgrade my units then call it a night. Aaaaaand it's already tomorrow evening."
9911,"I'd reccomend getting this, even if you've altready got CIV6. Definatley get the DLC though. As they add a nice layer of extra complexity and an extra dimension to shaft your oponents with."
9912,Its a  game play the game learn the game play the game
9913,I've played 500+ hours; it is a good game.
9914,Fun game.

9922,Be the lizard Danny!
9923,Great solid game.
9924,barely works
9925,yes
9926,The only thing civ 5 needs is less AI advantage early.. and more AI advantage late.  If I make it to the atomic age.. I beat the hell out of AI players 30 times my size.  That being said.. I prefer civ 5 simplicity over later versions.
9927,not bad
9928,"Met a nice brazilian wife on here and she is good to me , i love spcy fajitas so twas a match made in heven :)"
9929,i enjoy it
9930,iTS GREAT

9934,Excellent strategy game. All time favorite for longer game sessions.
9935,sad but fun memories
9936,"everything, play it and the next turn, turns into next 100 turns, you will never look back on the 12 hours you wasted on this game."
9937,a lot of fun
9938,10/10 I had to uninstall so I didn't drop out of college
9939,Personally I find this game much more enjoyable than CIV 6. Six over-complicatedly changed the system of how cities were set up via districts. All in all this is the first CIV Game that got me into the series and I willingly would put many more hours into this game than 6.
9940,the chat system is scary
9941,it is fun
9942,"its great
"
9943,I can't stop playing.
9944,Solid game  as all the Civilization games are.
9945,"start of as denmark, everyone hates indonesia and brazil. take out indonesia, everyone is happy, take out brazil, everyone wants to kill me. takes out russia and everyone but poland likes me. take out poland and nobody likes me. decides to nuke everyone, happy ending where vikings rule the world :)

10/10 but not full price, buy on sale"
9946,Learned to appreciate this game after playing CiV 6.
9947,"on of the game i liked most, unlucky its not much fun replaying it many times"
9948,its Civ 5. Does anything else need to be said?
9949,Sid Meier's Civilization® V
9950,Playing as India was fun
9951,"Fun strategy game, I'm godawful at it but its still fun"
9952,Better than Civ 6
9953,the greatest strat game
9954,This is possibly the greatest game I have ever owned.
9955,this game you can get tanks robots you can even go to space
9956,I love this history game and just can't stop playing it
9957,"Civ good, other non-civ game good"
9958,its a classic
9959,its alright
9960,No two games are ever the same. Can get pretty challenging with hours of entertainment and knowledge
9961,"It's a classic, the DLC collection bundle is worth it too."
9962,"This game is sadly unplayable now.  Crashing every 3 turns, or more frequently."
9963,"Dope
"
9964,Just perfect!
9965,is good
9966,"A very well done part of the series, absolutely recommended!"
9967,"Still enjoy this game. If they develop a civ VII, I hope they work from this & ignore civ VI."
9968,"na

9969,Game
9970,"I play with Lekmod in multiplayer lobbies. This game is fantastic, and there is a ton of depth and playstyles you can do. Every game is different, and there is always something you can improve. Definitely one of my favorite games, if not my #1 favorite."
9971,Better game then that trash civ 6 but it does have better dlc.
9972,YES
9973,"this game is freaking awesome
"
9974,It's good
9975,It's very fun and addictive. Recommended

9981,I nuked my friend and now he solty
9982,"Very fun game to play by yourself, with friends, or with strangers on the internet. Advice: If you're playing with others, always go for domination win!"
9983,"All their games are broken.
They release a game, they never fix the damn game breaking bugs, and they dare to call themselves ""AAA"".

FFF is more like it. Uninstall their shit, refund if possible."
9984,bomb
9985,"Help, please help! I think I'm married and have a wife. I think she feeds me. 12,651.9 hours on CIV V and loving every minute of every scenario.

9986,this game is drugs
9987,very fun
9988,"Is good, better than Civ6"
9989,game is very fun as a single player or with friends
9990,yes
9991,Like all parts of Civilization it is very interesting and you never stop to playing
9992,"guud
"
9993,"Cheating AI is so fun - all it takes is an invasion and your game is over. While the player can struggle to keep the money income up the AI can simply ignore it an shell out massive armies. Complete BS when a 6 hour round ends because the software decides to flip you a bird.

Edit: Played a bit more to find out if it was my strategy that was lacking or if mods (right up to cheats) could make the game better - nope, it stays horrible"
9994,it's civ alright
9995,Simply loving it!
9996,"good game, fun to nuke ppl"
9997,"first I got an error telling me it couldn't start and maybe I needed an update. So I tried again. Then it just went to the loading page, and sat there forever. I couldn't even get task manager up to close it. I was however, able to CTRL Escape, and right click and click close, and that seemed to work. ALT F4 wouldn't work, so that was my next best try. Deleting the game. Just gonna play something else I guess."
9998,Fine
9999,"Good game! Fun base game that provides a challenge when playing the highest difficulties, and good modding community that provides more content if you're bored of the base game"
10000,Awesome game! im lovin it after many years. Awesome game!
10001,I've played this game for almost 3 month of my real life; this game is addiction in a video game.
10002,yesss

WARNING: It's highly addictive. Once you get in, there's no way out"
10016,I denounce anyone who doesn't get addicted to this game.
10017,don't let this game ruin your life
10018,it is fun

10023,It's lit as a tit
10024,This game is HOURS of fun. It consist of strategy and coordination to allow for a type of game I haven't seen executed to this degree. I definitely recommend this game.

10026,"You need tons of patience, but aside from that this is a good game. I recommend getting it in a sale."

10032,"This is probably the best computer game I've ever played. Addictive and informative, all in one. The civilization aesthetic is one to behold."
10033,help me
10034,Fun. Wish they kept multiple units per tile though. Could be more deep.
10035,Its all right
10036,"The game is EXTREMELY addicting. At $7, this game (complete edition) is a steal!"
10037,love civ games
10038,"It's easy yet challenging, and the user interface isn't complicated. Great for days at a time fun."
10039,"Still the best, most complete Civilization. The only thing I prefer about Civ VI is the ability to build a large number of cities without penalty."
10040,"This game is one of my favorite games ever I used to have this game on my old account and I had 1000's of hours in this game and I know it's ""old"" now but I would still rather play this then civ 6 or any other game I have I highly recommend this game."
10041,Yes.

10043,good game
10044,"A classic, nothing more to be said..."
10045,"Civ V is an Incredibly fun and addictive game. It is designed perfectly - every mechanic an nuance makes it feel like you are really controlling a civilization, and you get a lot of freedom to apply your own method and still get a balanced game. Very recommended for anyone who likes investing themselves in a long empire-building strategy game."
10046,"Could have sworn I reviewed this game.  Its.... bad.
Its from the more modern school of gameplay with the everyone wins.
like the last game I played I just kept one city, no real research or expansion, just one city, one archer and one boat.

the AI in its simplistic nature declares war on me with its 20 cities and tech advantage.

and I'm sitting here watching the poor AI units die like lemmings to my stone age archer, boat and city, and I'm like...yeah.

you can't lose.  

posting this review mainly to see if they delete it.  but CIV 5 killed the franchise for me."

10061,"It is a good game despite some unbalanced places.
Different civilisations have different characteristics that match their historical roles and spirits. However, some of the Wonders do not match the  civilisation to reach the biggest effect. However, it is still hard work that the team produced this game and provide us a high-level game. 
The ways that can achieve victory are multiple, Victory by conquer is the most popular way to win. However, I do not know if it is due to the human nature of violence and conflicts or the different hardness of the ways of victory. I do believe that players enjoy the process of conquering other civilisations. whereas the existing ways to achieve victory other than conquer are as hard as my grandma's shoes. 
Overall I think it is a good game, a wonderful game with some places that need to be bettered."
10062,"If you like this sort of game, then it is very good"
10063,I mean its kinda cool.
10064,Tbh its better than CIV V imo. I would play more if i had the time. If you like TBS this ones a winner in my books.
10065,The very 1st version of Civ after Civ I that I really enjoy!
10066,"Hands down the most fun solo game you can play, especially when youre between the ages of 16-19 and you still have an very active imagination.

This game is the definition of the phrase, simple to learn impossible to master. 
 
Ive spent 1,000 hours on this game for a reason. I only start a game if I have about 12-14 hours to spare because I want to get total immersed.
Everything from founding cities to where you send your first worker, has an impact that reverberates over the entire game, especially when you get into the higher difficulties. Games like this are tremendous at teaching you the long term impact of your decisions, by allowing you make your own mistakes. 

I love this game, dude."
10067," Based. Redpilled, even."
10068,that bitch cocaine
10069,great
10070,"This game with at least one friend to play with is literally hundreds of hours of fun.
I don't know why I hadn't recommended it yet. Great game."

10072,"tits

10073,"Endlessly replayable. I feel terrible for wasting days on this game at a time, and the only way to feel better is to play more."

10076,It's aight

10078,This game is just heckin' rad.
10079,good
10080,"Pretty realistic, especially the battles. Archers rarely defeat tanks"
10081,Great time to nuke friend's city! Oh.. i don't have a friend anymore
10082,better than VI because it doesn't need micro management and aft levels of unexplained complexity
10083,I still play this more than VI
10084,It's good.
10085,"Bought this gem of a game a while back, have enjoyed every minute of it. The first time me and a friend were going to try hot-seat mode, we were a bit skeptic that it couldn't compete with Heroes of Might and Magic. With started 10pm and after a couple of turns it was suddenly 4am!
10/10 would recommend to anyone looking to enjoy single player, hot-seat and multiplayer. One of my all time favorite games :)"
10086,"Life long Civ player.  Thanks a lot, Sid.  The thousands of hours, the years of #onemoreturn.  I'd like to reclaim my time.  but alas, I must remain in pursuit of building a Civilization that will stand the test of time. This game certainly has."

10095,It's good I guess.... I play games sometimes... yea
10096,It's okay I guess
10097,Love the strategy play!
10098,"I am God, the creator of all man."
10099,This game is so in depth!  The one thing I dislike but from a programmer's and so as to not be totally overwhelming perspective is the turn based.  I wish there were more leaders as well.
10100,Very pogger. Get Vox Populi Community Patch to enhance gameplay and make all of the civs playable.
10101,kind of like fortnite
10102,"One of my favorite games. Not without flaws, but you can dump hours into it"
10103,"Excellent classic. I still like the Civ 6 a bit more in overall terms, except the x100 times worse  air combat, where Civ 5 really does well. Civ 5 is surely more simplistic and fun."

10106,"I've logged an unholy number of hours in this game, mostly because I tend to have it in the background when I work. I recently came back to Civ 5 from Civ 6, and generally feel like the game play makes more sense."
10107,"One of the best tabletop games i have ever played and i have played quite a few. As a veteranof the Total War series, this game brings a fresh perspective to an already oversaturated market. Definetly a great birthday present."
10108,Very good gaem
10109,fix game rubber band it's terrible you get any foot whole and it punishes with no come back. It goes against it's own laws of how the game is set. Example negative happy population due to special people and then you get rid of said special people yet the negative effect remains. Not the only problem either ai will always bend you over in every trade deal unless surrounded capital and that's if it's following game basics most of the time it ignores it and says no as if it truly has a choice. Harder difficulty is even worse with degen in both money any population content at the drop of a hat the game will just drop happy so it can attack you so lame like use so tact please it's strategy it's not hard especially with a point and click come on. please fix this

10111,Best strategy game i ever played!
10112,I like domination victory
10113,"this Civ is continuation of 3rd game in a series, which is something I like very much."
10114,"Love this game!!! It's successor came out 5 years ago, and the developers finally finished it about a week ago. I will continue to play Civ V until Civ 6, is finished and affordable."
10115,I have played all version of this for over 10 yer
10116,FUN
10117,its awesome
10118,Fantastic Game! It is still better than Civilization 6
10119,"I love the graphics, different civilizations you can choose from, and just the overall game environment."
10120,its a good time passer
10121,you can be george washington so i rate this game really good!! <3
10122,Easily one of the most innovative strategy games. Well worth the money.
10123,It gud
10124,"First 100 hours, I was broke and had an army to conquer everyone else with and lost cause I'm incompetent. 200 hours, a single enemy city settlement crippled my empire's entire economy due to roads.  Last 100 hours, 25% of the time is actually trying to get the game to work with new players, Lekmod, Lekmap. I have probably lost over 120 hours of my life trying to make the game work.

10 / 10, 
would recommend with friends and installing Lekmod and Lekmap from the NoQuitters Reddit group."
10125,I prefer this build over Civilization 6.  It's the perfect blend of a hex movement/city builder/strategy game.  Civilization 6 went more hex on me and I'm not really liking it as much.  I wish it weren't such an old game.  :(

Just one more turn....

10128,Yes.
10129,A very competitive game. Each new game plays out differently for hours of fun.

10138,Amazing game I have around 600 hours and still don't get bored.
10139,"It absolutely requires Gods & Kings and Brave New World to fix it back up, but it's worth some time once you have. On release it was terrible. Those two add back a lot of needed mechanics, like feedback to make AI Civ's actions feel less arbitrary, almost like you had diplomats or something.

Also actual diplomats which can let you tattle on one Civ that another is planning an attack on it. That's actually a really cute touch, even if it doesn't really matter much.

It doesn't unseat Civ IV as the pinnacle, and it's no SMAC either, but it does sit somewhere alongside as an interesting variation now. The no-stacking hex combat is an interesting but mostly failed idea: it's a frustrating traffic jam because hexes are city-scale so any mixed force or sizeable army gets stuck easily, and it's made a lot worse that the pathfinding will either abort and forget its destination or worse reroute half way around the world and through enemy territory if for one turn a tile it needed to stand on was occupied. The real killer is that AI is completely helpless to do anything with it---the tactical ranged/melee setup and cities being able to defend themselves pretty decently (they have health bars and ranged attacks now) are honestly interesting and satisfying mechanics, but the AI doesn't understand them. It rams artillery up against the city where it's shredded by the return fire, then bonks units off it one at a time without having worn its strength down. It ignores vulnerable opportunities. And it traffic jams even harder.

Oh, and the no-stacking? You can't do that *at all* on tiles with other Civs' units. Open Borders is an invitation to have your workers griefed.

All this (and stuff like the happiness mechanics and insane road tax---meant as a mitigation against the roads being so ugly in this one, the worst reason for a design decision I think I've ever heard) means it feels a lot more at home doing stuff like the One City Challenge as Venice on a smallish map, rather than big sprawling empires. But when that works, it *can* be fun---getting your City-State allies to proxy-war someone is something Civ IV can't really pull off very well. Full civs rarely want to unconditionally commit like that.

The whole Religion and Policy track mechanism is an interesting way to customize your Civ for your situation as you go, in a deeper way than the Civ IV (or SMAC) social engineering. Those are good changes. The new Tourism approach to Cultural victory is more interesting and in-depth than ""three legendary cities"" too, adding a more directly competitive angle than just racing to the finish.

And at least it's not as full of terrible non-obvious one-way traps as VI (just don't dig up too many artefacts), or as terrible illusion-shattering writing as Beyond Earth. For now, this, IV, and a patched-up SMAC are the best Civs going, each scratching slightly different itches."
10140,make me feel good
10141,good game
10142,best game to kill your time.every time i move to a new place and i wait for my internet connection to be transferred i lose my sleep playing this...thank you !

10144,Drug Addiction
10145,good game
10146,Perfect game to play while you work
10147,"Civilization 3 is the best and staunch to the original Civilization gameplay idea. It has the feel, the music/sounds and the atmospheric visuals AND the challenge. I Wish the AI would be better though... and not cheating X)"
10148,Fun
10149,good game man

10152,Like total war but you auto every battle.
10153,it's better than civ 6
10154,gewgaw kazooo
10155,Could have a little bit more of replayability
10156,"is good, classic game. Good. GOod. Gr3qat!"
10157,The game was Great when it came out. But Now there is Civ VI and well just play that instead
10158,Great game. Murder all the hours of your life with Civ 5.
10159,Just as good if not better than Civ 6.
10160,This was it. This was the pinnacle of gaming. We'll truly never do it better.
10161,"Now mature, and complete, and with an extensive modding community, can play for hours of enjoyment."
10162,"Really complete game, some bugs that make it better and community mods to fulfill your dreams."
10163,I like it; it's just not for me. Too slow. I learned on earlier RTS games and the pace of Civ5 is just not fast enough for me.
10164,"Amazing game, especially if you want to get started in strategy games. You will need the DLC for the full experience. Wait for it to go on sale, I think I got it for like 97% off, everything for $12. Great memories from this game. Civs V is a classic."
10165,"Much better than Sim VI. Great graphics, lots of fun options, countless hours of replayability! :-)"
10166,meh
10167,"Yes, yes and yes."
10168,"I really only play this game for the multiplayer but oh boy does the multiplayer deliver. There is no better feeling than forming a false alliance with your IRL friend and then dropping some nukes on him out of nowhere. Tons of fun. Really similar to a board game, but its on crack :)"
10169,One of the best in series.
10170,fff
10171,"what a game. what can i say, hours and hours into the game and didnt realize it was 5am already. No clock to let you know the real world was happening as well, just the way i like it. I dont know why but i prefer Civ 5 over Civ 6. Spent many a nights taking over the world."
10172,boring once u learn it
10173,All the game experiences are great in thought of the user interface and game play the online multi player is very interesting to the liking of the game and has many options to keep you playing
10174,    ggfhn
10175,alot of fun
10176,"I've been playing Civilization since the very first one and I love this series. It's fast paced, engaging, and a lot of fun! To this day it is still a challenge and I enjoy trying to create the best civilization ever!"
10177,This game is such a good time to play the stradgy behind this game is amzing like thinking about whetehr your millitary is good enough this is worth your money
10178,fun

10180,Worth it
10181,good

10187,TFW Everybody else's CIV is buying my blue jeans.
10188,Yup
10189,Countless hours in and still not old. Play it...
10190,"realistic, excellent gameplay
"
10191,Good game
10192,I'm playing Civ since its first version
10193,Pretty good. lots of differences from civ 4 but I like them both.
10194,"Awesome game, multiplayer is still so much fun. The only negative is that windows and mac/linux isnt crossplay as windows version is 32bit and the latter is 64bit which disables the crossplay. You have to go to an older Mac OS X to run the 32bit Civ v to crossplay or emulate windows"
10195,"With over 4k hours into it over the years, I can say I got my money's worth."
10196,Pretty fun game.  Good way to waste 8-10 hours without even realizing it.
10197,Just great
10198,This game is like a page turner book you cannot put down!  One more turn!
10199,"I was turned off by the turn-based part - but once you learn the basics of this game, it's really addictive. I really recommend this."
10200,"The game is great if you use the Vox Populi mod, but without it the AI is mind-numbingly dumb and the game very lacking in good mechanics."
10201,"I cannot truly express how trash this game is. This game is not only absolute garbage. The devs for this game have absolutely no desire to fix the fact that the workers are so bugged there is no point to playing this game at all. I tried everything on online communities to fix the problem with the workers and nothing helped. It's just absolute dog water game that doesnt make them money anymore so they dont care about improving the game play for the poor souls that actually paid moeny for this game like me. This game makes me want to // my wrists it is so frustrating to play. Not only that, my friend is completely infatuated with the game he cannot see how the game is bad. He is so obsessed that he cant see and this is a majority of the problem with the game as well. People like this ruin the game. I am going to look out on my balcony tonight over the city skyline and feel my blood pressure give me a headache from this absolute pathetic game. As I am currently typing this my buddy is screaming into my ear about how the game is so good and how i suck at the game. His absolute closed mindedness about the game having a single flaw at all is raising my blood pressure even more. Its the following like this that ruins games and makes me want to cover my pc in bacon grease and throw it in my dumpster. Honestly, Id rather run a high demanding game and see my pc overheat as i throw a blanket on it and watch it slowly combust. I am honestly sad to say i have 60 hours in the game. goodbye, fix the dadgum game"
10202,Hands down one of the best of all strategy games. I got 500 hours total between mac and pc versions and I was pretty much grown up in this game. Without the dlc's its not a good obviously but this will always be a game I would go back to at anytime.
10203,turn off barbarians
10204,nice
10205,Highly recommend this game to any player  great to just relax and play
10206,What more is there to say. It's CIV. You are about to lose the next 20 hours of your life.
10207,"Look at the time time played, of course I think it's good."
10208,Best multiplayer experience
10209,Never attack Valletta
10210,good
10211,its is like a game.
10212,its civ 5 wtf are you doing reading the reviews
10213,"I prefer this game over Civ 6, still"
10214,"Good game, but unexpectedly short... The game ended before I warmed up. 

I was 21 when I first started... Blinked twice, and the game ended.

The good part is that now, being retired at 72, i have plenty of time to go for another round!"
10215,good shit
10216,"After a ""mere"" 1,927 hours of gameplay (with perhaps 15% of the time spent asleep at the keyboard...) I have completed all 286 Steam achievements for Civ V. 

It's a testament to the game that it can hold one's attention  to be so readily re-playable and (mostly) enjoyable. 

I've played (overplayed?) all of the Civs since 1, and to me V is the best balanced of the bunch. (I only have about 250 hours in Civ 6, which is good but they hobbled with the new handling of roads & railroads.) 

I don't even mind spending 11.5 eight hour days over the last seven years to have done this..."
10217,a
10218,good game
10219,Im a hugh fan of SIV 5 but cant seem to connect with SIM 6
10220,I HAVE SPENT OVER 500 HOURS PLAYING THIS GAME ALMOST ENTIRELY WITH THE AI AND I DONT THINK I HAVE EVER ACTUALY FINISHED A GAME I JUST GET TO THE MODERN AGE AND START AGAIN ITS THE JOURNEY FOR ME NOT THE DESTINATION I HAVE EVERY INTENTION TO PLAY THIS GAME A CRAP TONNE MORE LESSSSSSSSSHHHHHHGOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
10221,"Though somewhat eclipsed by the next installment in the series (Civilization VI), it is still a very enjoyable game."
10222,"Gotta love doing marathon runs with friends. Been doing the same game for 2 weeks, almost 20 hours in this single match so far. Disabled every win minus domination. You haven't experienced Civ V until you send a whole army at your neighbors doorstep just to have a nuke tossed on his own city to wipe your army."
10223,"What is ""a life""? Expect to lose literal days once you boot this game up.
A wonderful edition of the Civ Franchise and great gameplay held within."
10224,best 3 am game time you can get
10225,this game used to be great but the decision to stop cross platform multiplayer has made it unusable very poor decision
10226,Let's see I have 638 hours on this. But I promise to quit in just one more turn.
10227,Not good
10228,"this game is so fun, my dad recommended it to me because he played it as a kid, and its a really good game"
10229,Buy this game on G2A hella cheap
10230,"Got a few rounds in and the game seems promising so far, hopefully it wont drop in quality towards the endgame"
10231,Great strategy game you can't go wrong with 4x.
10232,The only game in existence that answers the question we've all been asking. What if Ghandi was a psychopatic dictator?
10233,"I would not recommend this game to other people. For a number of reasons.

Reason 1. The enemy AI cannot play the game properly. It says a lot about a company that has not bothered to improve the AI of their STRATEGY game in over a decade. It doesnt use proper strategies or tactics. it cannot handle money. it bothers you with the same unfruitful trade agreement for 20 turns at a time. Installing better AI mods barely helps.

Reason 2. Every game the same technologies need to be researched in nearly the same order. The research tree is linear. It robs the player of sense of control. It feels as if you are being railroaded into the same trajectory every single game.

Reason 3. Warfare is the same every time again and again. You can win every battle every time no matter who is your opponent so long that you have three times as much units as you would anticipate you needed in the battle. You cycle troops if they get hurt to heal them. Grinding enemies to dust over time works every single time.

Reason 4. Enemy AI sometimes sends as little as a single unit to attack you. Not out of desperation. Simply as a strategy.

Reason 5. Diplomacy is reduced to 'yes' or 'no' answers. The whole interaction with other world leaders is reduced to a few simple questions you can ask them, which they say, yes or no. No follow up questions, no real conversations. You are only able to meet one world leader at a time. You never get to see interaction between other world leaders.

Reason 6. Increasing the difficulty mode only allows the AI to cheat. For example, on certain difficulty mode the AI can settle four cities at the start of the game, while you can only have one city. AI must not pay for troops, can train troops faster, can produce wonders faster. Not fun, not a real difficulty mode at all. Developer laziness.

These are all the reasons so far why I would not recommend this game to anyone. More reasons will be found in the future. Count on it!"
10234,i cant stop
10235,GOAT
10236,i
10237,Totally worth it!
10238,Have played every CIV version. This is fun to play and much more enjoyable and balanced against AI opponents. Far better than CIV VI.
10239,Great game
10240,"Better then Civ 6 except for ai civ's which give me a massive headache, honestly just dont try to be nice to other civs, it wont help in the long run."
10241,"Colonization Simulator 5 the Video Game! Awe hell, i had fun tho, which I'm not sure is a good or a bad thing."
10242,"great game
"
10243,Automate the workers. Check. That's all it takes to make me happy.
10244,"It's Civilization, it's fun."
10245,"This game is good, very good, its a way to lose track of time, it may as well be a time machine. One that only goes forward cause you will be like oh lets start a game, its 11pm okay lets play an hour or two before bed........OH NO ITS 7AM I HAVE WORK IN ONE HOUR!.... but lets do one more turn. Ah no now im unemployed and my parents dont know where i am anymore!"
10246,a fun game
10247,Awesome game
10248,"This game is awesome and i have played it anytime freetime i get the last week you can own the world if you want which is exactly what i did 
"
10249,great turn based battle sim perfect for multyplayer
10250,"Awesome game, highly recommended. As evidenced by the fact that I'm still playing it 11 years after I first started. Very few games have held my interest over that length of time and those that have, I haven't played this much. The gizmo tells me that I've clocked up 1999 hours. That doesn't include all the hours I've played offline whilst working overseas in places with no internet connection. Definitely a game that keeps me coming back. Tons of replayability and it can be as easy or as hard as you want it to be."
10251,Amazing and addictive!
10252,help i am addicted
10253,Love it
10254,Rada rada
10255,good fun game
10256,"Yeah, it's alright."
10257,"This civ game is very detailed yet comprehensive. It is well put together and VERY entertaining. If you are a civ game fan, this will definitely steal your time!"
10258,"you can freely open fire on missionaries. which is what i did.

that's what the celts get for trying to convert my cities

10259,"Fun, easy to learn, but difficult to win. Great game."
10260,Not too complicated and still has a lot of different options for different types of games.
10261,"The difficulty is perfect, quite hard, but not impossible. Not to mention it's incredibly fun!!"
10262,This is good
10263,"good game, fun."
10264,GOOOOOOD FUUCKING GAME
10265,i got addicted in 6 hours
10266,"It's an ok game to keep you entertained for 6-8 hours, but then it's worthless."
10267,I played this for 1500 hours. That is all the review you need.
10268,this sucks on ice
10269,"I have played this game way too much, because it's so damn interesting!  The varied outcomes due to the multitude of leaders and countries available make this an outstanding game.  

Among the few complaints that I have, are the difficulty in deleting old saved games.  This process is very time consuming, and clunky.  Also there are some unresolved problems with some of the units.  Basing aircraft on aircraft carriers can be problematical, because half the time that you base an aircraft on a carrier, you can't access it to use it."
10270,"There are mods here which would theoretically let people recreate certain historical events, and then fix history.  Nice.  

For purists, there are probably better simulators out there.  The difficulty of recreating an accurate geography bothers me.  But the mechanics are simple and it's got fun gameplay.  I'll take the symbolic victories."
10271,"Before I had kids, I literally spent a month or two playing 8 hour days of this game. It's good."
10272,great turn based game.
10273,Best Civilization Game ever made.

10280,Yeah it's pretty good
10281,Good. Shit.
10282,"This game is a classic of all time. I just downloaded civ 6, and it just isn't like civ 5. Most addicting game I've played. Yeah.

10283,yes
10284,gud gem
10285,mhm
10286,GG
10287,the game play is smooth and it is just fun
10288,"its trash

10289,I think it's about time I reviewed this game after 1335 hours... nah I got some civ to play
10290,Just...one...more...turn...........
10291,i love this game very well designed.
10292,Cool
10293,GOAT civ game GOAT strategy game. Only downside? Too addicting
10294,"Super fun, great mods, so many things to do. Yet still simple enough to figure out,"
10295,Don't know what more there is to say about this game. I've played hundreds of hours and will probably play a few hundred more. One of my favorite games in general.
10296,great game.
10297,More balanced than Civ 6
10298,nerf poland
10299,stupid dumb
10300,I love this game.  I've been playing it for years and I can't get enough of it
10301,"I very much like this game, it is a good strategy game that can appeal to many play styles, whether you want to play aggressive and attack every Civ you see, or whether you play passive and go for late game goals. The graphics are great and I love the design, and the animations of other Civ interactions are very good. They also made some very good DLC's which were worth the purchase, and the scenarios are very fun, and I appreciate them being war based. Overall it's a great game with great diveristy in options and very good playability considering its use of save files and how many turns are in the game. However, despite all of the great things about the game, there are some good scenarios that can only played through DLC, and while I suppose they are good enough to be worth purchase, I still would've liked more than one scenario available with the base game purchase."
10302,pretty cool
10303,amazing game
10304,"i don't know why it only says 261 ive definitely played it more than that becuase with all the dlc this game is so fun, even more so with friends."
10305,GREAT FUCKING GAME
10306,Fantastic units with many different attack attributes.  Many different countries with unique benefits.
10307,It's a pretty good 4x game
10308,Based game. Five Stars.
10309,Best
10310,"Finished the tutorial, Ghandi nuked me, not sure how to feel. I am excited to start my first game on warlord difficulty now !"
10311,"Longest game I've ever played, but it's so worth it. Methodical and addictive."
10312,"Only here can you recreate the 1000-year conflict between the powers of Japan and the Iroquois, who were nearly defeated by the combined power of Russia and France after conquering Siam and razing the Persian powerhouse to ashes, but rose to conquer the world. The 1930's fall of Moscow against a backdrop of cannon and artillery fire brought about the world as we know it, with samurai occupying the city and celebrating the conquest in remembrance of the last Mohawk warrior who was killed during the siege-- without these events, who knows where we might be today? Certainly not in this beautiful one-world Japanese-Iroquois government!

Honestly, if you're a history or anthropology nerd like me, you're already aware of Civ. But this is the game that keeps me playing for hours and hours, and I always end up coming back to it, so I felt compelled to leave a review. I'm a veteran Age of Empires geek, and so much of that feels familiar here, but without the intensity and stress of having to be fast in everything you do. Civ brings my love of history and turn based strategy games together in a wonderful way, and Civ 5 does it the best. It's where XCOM and Age of Empires meet.

I'm always impressed in the differences in gameplay as you advance. Whether you're maintaining your cities in the early medieval age, exploring the unknown world in the Renaissance, or dealing with world politics in the modern era-- or outwitting your enemy's military in any time period-- this game has a deep level of function to let you tweak what you want until you have it just right. I learn something new about the game every time I play.

The one thing I really want to mention though is the online play, specifically the ""Pitboss"" gametype and what it does for the game's accessibility. While ""pitboss"" functionality can be finicky, if you get it to work right it's perfect for the busy nerd on the go, like me and my buddies. We can set up a game, and log in and take our turns when convenient. It reminds me of the old play-by-email Diplomacy games we used to play in bygone days. It isn't the fastest way to play but it allows you an option to continue the game amidst hectic lifestyles and varying schedules, so that you can pick it back up together at some point and just play for a couple hours. If you like the long-term games from Ancient to Future like I do, this is really the only way to log the time to do so-- and, furthermore, it's the only game of which I'm aware to have this sort of play.

The expansions bring a lot to the table and are definitely worth it, even if only for the variety of civilizations in the random games. I love seeing Babylon in the modern era, Native American civs delivering nukes, and other peoples leaping from the pages of history to kick ass in alternate histories.

Overall, I highly recommend this game!"
10313,yes
10314,Very good game
10315,Very fun strategy game. 9.5/10. Only issue for me seems to be liberating cities in the middle part of the game. Besides that its perfect.
10316,Shoshone are busted-manifest destiny but native style
10317,Ein wahrer Klassiker mit Sucht Faktor
10318,Nothing beats ending the world in nuclear fire as murder-gandhi.
10319,its a good game
10320,Yes strategy
10321,good game
10322,very strategic tho a bit boring with no dlc but still good
10323,"Love this game,  trying to beat it on every level"
10324,Where is Israel?
10325,Player of Civ fanchise since 1994... Enough Said. Indeed.
10326,It is addicting. There are many ways to play.
10327,good
10328,"Each game is different, my favorite since kid"
10329,"Yes I would recommend this game do not buy civ vi. Its complete trash compared to v. V is the superior civ game in every way shape and form. I'm really just typing this waiting for my brother to get his mic set up so we can play it together.. totally out of boredom. I'm not saying the retail prices for the dlc's aren't worth it, but summer sale really makes the bang worth your buck. Seriously uhh, give this a shot yo."
10330,"loved how fun it is and how it passes time
"
10331,"I started out Civilization Sid Meier's version in its' first release.  I played them all including CIV VI .  While I enjoy(ed) them all CIV V is my favorite.  19 thousand hrs of playing!  I made it to the highest AI level and won several times (with multiple leaders/ board arrangements/ and cultural choices).  Perhaps success drives my decision and the choices that are available make this release fun, challenging after ""lay offs"" and always different."
10332,"I've been playing Civilization since it first came out.  Version V is good, but not great.  The game difficulty has been significantly increased and I find myself reduced to playing ""easy"" when before I could play ""normal"".  I miss the spy.  I'd revert to Civ IV but I don't think it will run on Windows 7.  Bummer."
10333,Its hours of fun!
10334,"i like the its a game that its not just war and killing other people, ant the bad thing is well there is so many versions and you want them all but it takes up all your storage."
10335,Just finished the tutorial. This game should be fun!
10336,monkey brain like to dominate
10337,I like the game.
10338,best civ game by far.
10339,I LOVE IT!!
10340,w chuj
10341,"What can I say, it slaps."
10342,ass
10343,I love inventing nuclear warheads while the other countries just learnt what gunpowder is
10344,fun game i mean just play and enjoy
10345,"If you like pogging out diplomatically with wide brain plays, purchase this old but gold gem of a game."
10346,Yeah this game is uh... A good way to spend an hour or two...
10347,.
10348,i like this game
10349,Great strategy game
10350,"yes.
"
10351,"Very fun, good difficulty range for me. Can lose hours playing Civ."
10352,Excellent design.  Incredibly addictive.  One of my personal favorites.
10353,"An amazing turn-based strategy game. Served as my introduction to both the series and the genre. Definitely worth the hours I have put into it. Also, would suggest for those who are fans of history, especially empires."
10354,much good game. I like how heros are not made of water. must eat more mice if i turn into a cat though.
10355,Still the best Civ game.
10356,"It is a fun and amazing game. you basically build what type of game play and everything
"
10357,It is a fun and you get to meet your friends or family members.
10358,Fantastic game that never gets old.
10359,"Dr.Sid Meier really out did himself with this game on many innovative fronts! I love how the game brings many new creative elements that were previously gone unimplemented into many other games by ""less worthy"" developers like sid mirror! But, alas, the game has a fatal bug. If you play online, they do not have a decent protection against bots (should have built the ""Great Firewall"" lol!) And the user ""Ocean4Hire"" will join your earth game and completely mess it up! When I got into the game, the continent of Africa was now in America! I tried to play it cool, saying ""It is literally impossible, the game is bugged"". Little did I know, this ""bug"" was intentional. Soon he built a religion out of thin air, the religion name?; I HAD SEX WITH (MY REAL NAME)'s Gran!!!!. He also said so much mean stuff about France (MY home country! IRL!) and told me that we are poor losers who just eat frogs, do violently gay crimes, and a lot of stuff about scarves and private parts. ""WE DO NOT EAT FROGS!"" I typed dropping my plate of snails; He left amused, like how he does every game he joins... I am giving Civy 5 a recommendation but should install a ettqute bot."
10360,"The movement in this game is way better than the movement in Civ VI (subjective).  El dorado and Fountain of Youth are op natural wonders (objective).  Civ VII should have Civ V movement again, which is exciting (subjective).  The music is worth it alone (objective)."
10361,"very good, would play for another 984 hours"
10362,"ok
"
10363,"I would not recommend if you have anything you need to do. Ever,"
10364,Very good game
10365,"This game is perhaps the foremost member of the much loved civilisation series. It doesn't match the level of detail and complexity of its predecessor but in my opinion more than makes up for this with charm, interesting mechanics and choices and simply being good fun to play. (It still stands up well next to its successor too). The main differences from historical Civ games are the hexagonal grid (improvement in my view, maps look a lot more natural), simplified mechanics (no need to micromanage transport ships or the irrigation effects of farms) and the fact that you can't stack units on top of each other, each taking up a tile exclusively. The last change changes combat a lot and in my opinion for the better, making placement important (ranged attacks have real range) and giving potential for tactics beyond who has the biggest stack.
The most controversial change in my view is the strong disincentive to over-expansion with happiness being global such that conquering an enemy city or founding a new one can make your whole empire suffer from unhappiness. There are also a lot of other tweaks to make small empires competitive with large ones. Overall this makes the path to victory a lot more complex than in previous civ games (not simply bigger is better) as simply taking over extra land may not be a good thing if there's no resources to help you there.

Overall, this game is a true classic (with the expansions - they add a lot and the base game feels quite limited without them) and I would strongly recommend it. The AI is quite poor as ever but it is a really brilliant game to play with friends (even if it does take longer than monopoly - it's short compared to civ 4)"
10366,Great 4X game
10367,Recommended.
10368,enjoyer of this but not eu4 so thank u
10369,Its like im leading a civilization
10370,Would you be interested in a trade agreement with England?
10371,this is a great strategy game that has also taught me about historical events
10372,"What can I say, great game"
10373,"played 960 hours, enough said"
10374,game fun
10375,"It's Civilization, even when it sucks it's better than most games.  I mean come on..."
10376,I prefer Civ V over Civ IV. I tried playing Civ IV quite a few times but just can't feel the pull to it.
10377,hmmm
10378,classic game
10379,Best game ever. Even better than the 6th one
10380,"Fun game, I think it is more fun then 6 for the most part, for sure more like the classics. If you like Civ this is the one I would buy first."
10381,This game is a masterpiece.
10382,its ok
10383,fantastic strategy game. Board game made virtual. super intuitive. great voice acting.
10384,Awesome game
10385,"I played the original Civ and Civ II.  Out of all the versions of civilizations, this version keeps it simple yet engaging."
10386,addictive
10387,If I wanted to see a tree I would just look out my window.
10388,
10389,Great stradegy game. Lots of was to play.
10390,"After finally being able to beat it in single player I can finally write this review. I have played America, Japan, Russia, and Poland. The Game is basically just rushing to build nukes and use them to slow down the biggest nation. I have won as Poland and America as they are amazingly op as fuck. That being said this game is absolutely slow and will take over 200 turns to win. Science is the easiest victory with these nations, its really the best way to go since you get XCOM and destroy everyone. The AI is BS and will always be a few steps ahead even if it doesn't make since and you B line science. I give it a 7/10 POLAND IS OP and its funner with buddie :D"
10391,Very Fun!
10392,kool init
10393,Good Game. Need I say more?
10394,Listen to me. Go Japan.
10395,"I've been playing this while watching shitty movies, like Over the Hedge - a 2005 Dreamworks film that is absolute completely dogshit. I couldn't tell you much about that movie, but I can say that Civ V is a fantastic video game that I wish I had started playing sooner.

I literally had a dream last night about Civ V - wild."
10396,good way to use your brain and pass time
10397,"""Why do the Mayans have nuclear weapons?""
My room mate walking by my laptop a few years ago. 
i just laughed. like I had been for the last hour as I took down the world. 

Though I may have some issues with ego mania."
10398,"Always loved Civ, this one is fantastic with only a few problems"
10399,game sucks you in...
10400,It's aiight
10401,"A worthy member of the greatest game series in the world - very addictive.
My wife and me are playing for hours at a time (in hotseat mode)."
10402,Absolutely fantastic. A true classic.
10403,"Its a great game, it can be as deep or as simple as you need it to be.  With mods so much is possible. I love it."
10404,"Very fun, I hope to finish a game some time"
10405,dog shit just buy the 4th one
10406,not as good as 4 but still pretty good
10407,"Love this game. Confession - I been playing this game when Civ  1 first came out. It was child's play at first. As it grew I grew with it. Fun it was. Challenge it became.  I hated nothing about this game. Civ 3 I started writing my own games. creating my own pieces. Bombers that destroyed roads and rails. Everyone back then was in this. The creation of traveling into space where we were able to create our own space ships. I can go on but it was fantastic. Civ 4, 5 and 6. Wow, for those of you that missed this you will never know how much. Those of you that were apart of this and still are today knows what and where I am at with this.
What went bad for me is the computer got hit with a worm and I lost everything. Passwords and so on. I was not able to get any help recovering my history's. The games I purchased, every thing gone. Then my system fried. Damn. But I just got back and this is the first game I reinstalled. Enjoy this every one, you will."
10408,"very addictive, great game for it being so old!"
10409,Is good.
10410,Civ
10411,good clean fun for the whole family
10412,Stimulates the brain and is fun at the same time. It's enough of a departure from Civ 3 and 4 to make it interesting. I haven't played Civ 6. Without a compelling reason I proabably won't.
10413,This is my favorite turn-based empire game!
10414,yay
10415,Very fun and good replay value as I believe I have shown with my 721 hours.
10416,Shhheit mah this game GOOD
10417,"This is very good game. It is a great length and has a ton of content. The game is very fun to play with friends as well as alone. There is a reason I have so much time on it. I definitely recommend this one over Civ VI. The only negative in this game is the stupid happiness system. Besides that, it is really good. 9/10"
10418,It's ok
10419,One of the most addictive games ever.
10420,neat
10421,"great game

10422,fun game

10424,Great Gaem.
10425,Loved it
10426,"This game has provided literally hundreds of hours of endless fun. So many challenges, great workshop mods that add even more if you get tired of the base game. Along with the scenarios within. Highly recommended!"
10427,Beef
10428,"Best game ever.
"
10429,"I would not like to enter a trade agreement from England. BTW, those line ships can't touch my landlocked country! GL"
10430,Its a great game. look up some youtube videos its not hard to learrn
10431,A must-have classic.
10432,"I got this at Walmart for 20$ not to long ago and let me say, this is the best 4x strategy game i've ever played. Conclusion: it's an amazing game."
10433,"Got 5 hours, wanna have fun. Civ V."
10434,"Nutshell? Better than IV, but still not III."
10435,"Shit interface, plays like it's not finished (when it's nearly a decade old). Units forgetting orders, so you have to micro manage the idiot every turn until a job gets done (which might mean giving the same instruction to a worker 12 times), idiot units running to the right side of the screen when you right click notifications. Fuck off CIV5 you waste of money and time! Shit cunt!"
10436,"Great way to lose track of time, lose your job, lose your wife, and lose everything. 10/10"
10437,The superior Civ experience.
10438,
10439,"Great depth to this game, despite its age. Good fun"

10452,is good
10453,"As a guy that loves strategy game and hard drugs, this is the best waste of time available. Pro tip: crank up the difficulty and do massive lines of blow while you play"
10454,I would definitely recommend this game! It's really great :) Only downside is multiplayer is incredibly glitchy.
10455,name a better game
10456,cool game
10457,Awesome game to get immersed into
10458,"If you are a stradegy player, I totally recommend this! If you are an old Civ player from past games this is also for you! For parents this is a great game, it helps make your child brain work quicker and also this game isn't as violent! I recommend this to all players no matter if your young or old!"
10459,Solid base. would Reccomend as a good starter
10460,eysyeyyses
10461,best game ever
10462,this game is broken.

10467,It's a fun game
10468,"Honestly, its one of my favorite time killers!"
10469,"I used to play this instead of doing homework.

Base game is good and there are some great mods for it. I like it better than 6 still."
10470,"Great fun, better with friends 9/10"
10471,I am bored but can't stop playing this game. ugh.
10472,Quite simple really - it's a very very good game
10473,fun
10474,Arguably still the best of all the Civ titles
10475,yep
10476,Better than civ 6.
10477,I've spent countless hours coming back to rule the world!
10478,"You really can't talk smack about Gandhi in this game.

I mean, Ghandi might be a racist, imperialist, money wh*re, selfish, irrational, disloyal, ambitious, cold-hearted killer, rapist, adulterer, calculating, merciless, dreadful, ruthless, wrathful, masochist, a backstabber, warmongerer, a f*cking bastard and a f*cking c*nt but he'll never, EVER, be bad trading partner - 10/10.

P.S Just fuck Ganhdi, man."
10479,it's a great rts
10480,"While I prefer Civ VI more often than not, I really love Civ V's emphasis on history and its sense of grandeur. Certain game mechanics are also more fleshed out and enjoyable and the game is a must play for any fan of the series or the 4X genre."
10481,"Yes.

Best civ game, make sure to get the DLC.
Prices drop like crazy on sale."
10482,Yo i played over 2000 hours. Its fucking good
10483,great

10487,"Best Civ so far for me, and I played Civ VI. if you like turn by turn strategy game with scale and depth, enjoy!"
10488,I don't have much to say but its a really good game.
10489,me pillage and rape
10490,very good game 🐸
10491,Fun as fudge.
10492,Not bad
10493,its good
10494,buy this. Get the DLC too for the best experience. I bought it on sale and it had a pretty hefty discount so it's worth the money for sure.
10495,yo this shit boring
10496,"I've been playing Civilization since Civ 2 was released in 1996, and to me this is the best game in the series so far. This one has all the great mechanics that make a good Civ title, but without the micromanaging required by other titles. Just note that the base game is severely lacking in some core areas (religions and culture, mainly), so playing with both expansions is a must (they are also required by the Vox Populi mod)."
10497,Passively introduced to me cultures I've never heard of otherwise and so easy to put down for a while and come back to.
10498,A easy to learn game that is also a time-blackhole.
10499,Played a bit. Good game

10509,YES
10510,yay
10511,"I've been playing Civilization games since I owned a PC in the late 90s and Civ V is by far the most accessable and fun game of the series. There is so much content here that you'll find yourself playing for hours, wanting to expand your town and armies across the terrain. Its the typical 'one more click' style of gameplay that keeps you coming back for more."
10512,yes
10513,fun game and will easily suck the time away but also easy set up to stop when you need to and pick up again on a different day
10514,This game has given me so many hours of entertainment. I've played it with my friends and my younger siblings. Worth every penny.
10515,Great game.
10516,"Garbage, can't play borderless window, window mode is too tiny, fullscreen has black borders when using higher resolution, graphics settings not saving."
10517,Say goodbye to your family for about 10 hours.
10518,"With all the DLC easily one of the best Civ's, and far better than 6. Lack of Mac/PC crossplay is rough."
10519,Far better than Civ 6 very fun game solo or with friends
10520,yes
10521,"500 hrs+. The most addictive game in my 500+ library, not one of."

10526,Best round-based strategy game í've played so far. :)
10527,This game will time suck the crap out of you
10528,"Very engaging, however, I wish it would have told me that I had to take cities with melee units."
10529,It's the only Steam game I play!
10530,yes
10531,Was a great game till it crashed everytime i try to play after opening scene.
10532,One of the greatest civ games ever.
10533,"Even though I favour CIV IV more than this, its still a good game."
10534,Good
10535,"Highly addictive, but massive fun."
10536,Best way to forfeit your social life and free time.
10537,One more turn...
10538,"its fire
"
10539,"I play the Civ franchise since the first game. This game does not add much to the franchise but to be honest, it's pretty much staled since Civ3. 

If it's your first Civ game then no problem, it's a fine game in itself but you might be better with the latest Civ game they will release in the future.
"
10540,Graphics and design
10541,good game
10542,"Any lover of the Sid Meier's franchise of games is bound to enjoy this game. With all the different civs, religions, and scenarios there are endless hours of play."
10543,Fantastic
10544,good
10545,Games Awesome
10546,Definitely pulled a few all nighters with this game hahaha
10547,"CIV 5 is always different and there are many things to do in each game. I enjoy the many maps and features this game has to offer. This game definitely takes time to learn to be decent at it, but well worth. This turn based strategy game will force you to think outside the box because there are so many factors that can change one game. Also, if you do get this game, make sure to change some settings before you change because there are some annoying settings not to have!"
10548,Pretty much the only game I play aside from RDR2. IT's great highly recommended.
10549,"Civ 4 vet
bought 5 on release, puked on it
tried paradox games, never came back to sid"
10550,"Civ franchise? It will never die. Probably a reason for that.

Do me a favor, do it, do it."
10551,"This is a puzzling experience. A definite improvement on Civ IV. But definitely not the kind of game one expects after playing Civ III. Give it a try, I guess."
10552,GGGGGG
10553,IT GOOD
10554,DB plays this
10555,"Haa. I just never could get this to be an enjoyable experience at any point at all, despite all the hundreds of hours spent playing (and a sizable portion of that was offline and didn't get registered by Steam). The fact is, the game is just more imbalanced, more unstable, less developed/interesting, less covered by notable mods, less readily moddable, and just countless other ways of saying ""less good"" than Civ IV. 

Unmodded Civ IV was a lot, lot more fun an experience than this game and not only were the mods easier to work with in Civ IV, they were far more robust and stable. I can't even begin to count how many hours I spent trying and failing just to bring Civ V back up to Civ IV standards on its various systems, either through searching out mods or making attempts of my own. 

The fact is, with Civ IV out and Civ VI out (the latter of which I haven't played, but everyone assures me it's not only better than V, but resolves all the various shortcomings it has) there just isn't any reason to go for Civ V anymore. Unless you can get it dirt cheap or for free, and just want to get it for curiosity's sake, then definitely go for IV or VI instead.

 'Cause, really, this isn't even an offering I'd recommend as a ""timekiller once you've burnt through the better alternatives"". Instead, I'd just recommend playing through the alternatives once again, no matter how burnt you are on them. Really, nothing made me miss Civ IV as much [and increase the regret I felt over losing both the discs and ISOs of the game during moving] as playing this game. :/



Putting aside the limitations brought out by the underdevelopment of many, many systems in the game, the combat and building and research process just felt more limited and monotonous than before.

 The AI was somehow worse (and, let's be honest, Civ hasn't had anything akin to good AI up to this point)- to the point where, even with ""Always War"" toggled, the AI were still fumbling confused on how to fight each other, and ignoring City-States entirely. In fact, in any aggression against the player they're perfectly happy to send their units into your grinder, though, without ever considering flanking maneuvers or waiting till they had a larger force to send or sending more appropriate units or.. 

Which, again, we're not looking for amazing AI out of the Civ series but, at the same time, it's hard finding an AI as un-engaging in combat and as deranged in Diplomacy as this game's.

 And with ""Always War"" not toggled, good luck getting any wars going to begin with, unless they think you're easy pickings [and they'll do that equally much regardless of your previous relationship with them. Everyone in this game is both capricious and enamored with backstabbing] or have a momentary fit out of nowhere. 



Really, a game where you can control the shots with a minimum of effort is just.. well, not dull, persay, but definitely that and more if the sim aspect is also lacking (which it is). When you're not dealing with the nutjob who is aggroing on everyone, you're basically just sitting idle and picking your next victim from the nations competing for a country-based version of the Darwin Award.

Mind you, I'm talking about max difficulty and even with several different AI boosting mods up. At best, you give them an early resource and tech advantage that you can absolutely never overcome (due to how the game is balanced). Using the In-Game Editor mod (which is unbelievably useful and the best part of the Civ 5 experience) I desperately tried to manipulate the AI into being smarter than it was and balancing its early and late game boosts [ie, reducing the former and massively increasing the latter] but the fact that the AI just wouldn't act in anything resembling an intelligent- or even just functional- manner is sad.



As far as multiplayer, even without touching it I wouldn't recommend it, as this game is tedious even by genre standards [and multiplayer generally amplifies such impressions significantly]. You're either rushing through indistinguishable upgrades quick enough that balance and atmosphere and strategy is messed to hell, or you're idling in especially dull combat for ages. And let's not get into the bugs, exploits, and vastly preferenced approaches (over others). Though the fact is, even once you try and get everything balanced out via modding, you are still left with a lackluster game..



It'd be one thing if the game I was comparing it to was a different IP but, Civ IV was its straight predecessor.. Honestly, other than changing from square map tiles to hex ones and adding in inherent city defenses, I can't think of a single thing V actually improved. Oh, it implemented a few new systems, but none of those were notable or developed enough to be worthy of recommending anything off of on their merit alone [for example, City-States just never felt distinct enough to matter. Comparatively, it's far more appreciable to just play with more AI [via a mod which increases the cap, allowing you to enable AI up to a shared internal total of 64 used by both City-States and Nations], since the City-States don't actually do anything really distinctive (unless you're playing specific civilizations, like Venice).

There's countless threads detailing what Civ IV did better, but here's one to start you off, if you're still in the mood to read: https://www.reddit.com/r/civ/comments/2feka4/a_comparison_of_civ_iv_and_civ_v/

Honestly, at heart Civ V just feels like a dumbed down, less stable, more exploitable, prettier version of IV, with far worse AI. Honestly, if I'd still had my copy of Civ IV, I'd have given up long ago. Rather, here's hoping VI goes on decent sale soon.."
10556,The crusade needs to begin somewhere
10557,"As a player of all previous versions, I can say that I've been hatching my world domination plans again with new changes in the play mechanic that have given a fresh gameplay experience. I always wait for ""gold"" editions with all expansions before giving new versions a go so I can experience the full game. I definitely recommend this !  My rating : 90%"
10558,its awesome!!!
10559,yay
10560,This is by far one of my favorite strategy games.
10561,so solid.
10562,It's fun
10563,"This game is super demanding, I have a great computer too!
My software says that this games runs ""excellent"" and at 400+ FPS for me..
I don't see why my computer runs so hard, whether I am playing on High Settings with
Direct-X 10-11 or Direct-X 9 on Low Setting my computer seems like it's running hard!

EDIT: Game worked great after I [enabled] the V-Sync option to cap the FPS!"

10/10 would do again"
10573,"I like the game and i got all the dlc when it went on sale as a bundle. At first, it was a different stratagy game that I was use too. Honestly compared to civ 6 this game is very distinguishable between each other. The play style is very strait forward in the game and in civ 6 there's more enhanced features were other aspects such as natrual disasters were made possible. But this game has its own unique play style to enjoy. What I really like about is the unit building and tec tree its simple and doesnt require another building taking up a hex tile for more unit bonuses. you could stack 10 are units in a city civ 6 only has 4 by default for the air hanger. unit promotion is simple, you just click on what upgrades you want and there isn't unit corps forming."

10582,This is one of my favorite games! It is like a glorified game of risk but way more details..

10587,I downloaded this game a week ago and have 37 hours in it
10588,"game
"
10589,"The versatility for winning conditions makes this game constantly replayable.  My first multiplayer victory was today, and despite being behind in every category (except faith) for 5000 years, I was able to cajole enough city-states to win via delegates!  I tried invading the other players and failed.  I tried spying them up and failed.  I even was embargoed at one point by the world, but was able to slowly and sneakily get those delegates!  Amazing game.  Best strategy game I've ever played and the amount of mods on the Workshop is simply staggering, taking a replayable game and making it basically infinite.  Strongly recommend for strategy fans."
10590,"Yes Great title, hours and hours of fun on this account and my previous one."
10591,.
10592,Was addicting
10593,multiplayer is literally waiting an hour for other players to make their turn
10594,Very fun and great for those people that enjoy conquering the world.
10595,You have discovered : A Recommendation
10596,good
10597,Easily the best civ game especially when modded.
10598,"If you love games like Starcraft, but aren't very good at thinking at warp-speed (like me), then Civ V is a must for you. It's turn-based as opposed to real-time, and allows much more time to strategize, or just enjoy a plethora of historical Leaders, Buildings, and citizens."
10599,Seems fun so far
10600,Civ V best Civ just wish my friends would play it :(((((((((((((((((

AI still has ridiculously unfair requests when trading, I wish they'd balance that."

8/10"
10607,"I tried to play this game diplomatically, offering gifts in trades to the other Civs and keeping my borders open to anybody who wished to pass or explore the rest of the continent.
However, after I settled a small city far away from my capital in order to get rare resources which were not available in my immediate vicinity, everyone started becoming hostile towards me, denouncing me to the rest of the Civs and positioning offensive units near my borders.

It was only when, after a long period of unrest, both the Civs on the continent declared war against me and I realized that peace was never an option.

Then I taught those fuckers a lesson, artillery OP."

Civ V is probably my favorite gameplay wise. The decisions to get rid of doomstacks, change the board squares to hexagons and make terrain more important for combat were needed to freshen the franchise up. They got the look of the rulers right imo. I'm personally not a huge fan of districts so this makes V my personal favorite. It does not have the diversity of VI nor the charm of II though."

10789,"It's CIV, sure... but massively dumbed-down. Many of the best features present in IV have been removed, with the hex grid being the only neutral replacement. Here's what's wrong IMHO:

1) No unit stacking. Far and away their biggest blunder. Some coastal cities now can only be attacked by a couple of units. What happened to the glorious huge battles we came to love, pitting dozens of cavalry and cannon against a city held by half-a-dozen plucky riflemen? Gone. Apparently, having too many units is confusing for some players.
2) No religion. I thought the IV implementation was done very well - seven major religions represented, all treated equally, all with identical effects, and allowing the game to (crudely) model some of the drivers of conflict throughout human history. I guess it must have offended some focus group because now it's gone. I guess all those religious buildings you construct these days are just to some nameless spiritual entity...
3) Naval strategy restricted. With all land units being amphibious and able to cross oceans, naval units are now limited to escort duties. Managing transports is clearly too much of a mental overhead.

There are other issues, and a couple of minor redeeming features - city states and physical wonders are a nice touch. But compared to IV it's a massive step down. Stick to IV and you'll be far happier, unless you like a cartoon of a game dumbed-down for the console generation."
10790,"banger of a game, 2021 and still plenty playable. Heavily recommend this over any turn based strategy game, including Civ 6 (which is a pile of dissapointment)."
10791,"Great Game! In my humble opinion the BEST CIV game they have created. Beautiful graphics, easy to learn but still a challenge to beat."
10792,Be prepared to succumb to the 'One More Turn' curse with this...
10793,"I've had this game for years, and I still crack it out to play from time to time. Pro tip: You can't be nuked by Ghandi if you play as Ghandi."
10794,cool
10795,Civ V is one of the best games I've ever played. You can come into this game with no knowledge of how it works and it allows you to clearly and easily understand it.
10796,george washington simulator
10797,It's alright I guess.
10798,Pretty good.  Played it for a bit.
10799,"In my opinion, Civ-5 is the pinnacle of the Civilization series. I have been playing since Civ-1, and I can tell you this one has the best combination of Balance, Graphics, and Game-Play. While Civ-6 does have some Game-Play advantages, it has a serious and fatal Balance issue which totally destroys all enjoyment that a good strategy game should have as a foundation. Civ-5 lacks some of those enhanced features, but the Balance was near perfection."
10800,"I have enjoyed this game every time I install it. Once I start a game, I can't really stop."
10801,"If you've ever wanted to build cities and armies while interacting with world leaders from all across history, Sid Meier's Civilization is the game for you. You'll probably learn a few things, but mostly you will have lots of fun trying to become the best civilization in whatever way you choose. You can try to destroy all your enemies with sheer military might, but there are several other ways to win. Just about every choice you make matters. Where will you turn for resources? How much effort will you put into diplomacy? Let me tell you, some of your AI opponents are meaner than others (of course you can play with humans too).

Each game of Civ is pretty lengthy, but it always leaves me hungry for another. The game is approachable (and offers tons of help), but as you gain experience you'll want to try different strategies. You can customize difficulty quite a bit: If you want a challenge you can get it, or you can kind of just relax and enjoy advancing your civ through history without worrying.

I definitely recommend the Brave New World expansion also. It adds a ton of cool elements like religion and world congress."
10802,"An amazing game that takes up way too much time.
I would recommend getting all the expansions, but the base game is not bad alone.
It is worth looking at Civilization 6 instead, but this game is by no means outdated."
10803,"Simplistic game play, great graphics, and fun"
10804,this game is like crack
10805,literally the worst game of all time
10806,I love this game. it has excellent playability allowing me to multi-task yet still play the game. I actually prefer this version to the the Civ IV or VI. I did have an issue with an bug when I went to launch the game but that has cleared up.
10807,"I would definitely recommend this game to others.

Alright, I have played a whole lot of Civ games - from the first one many many moons ago to the 6th one - and I have to say that 5 will always have a special place in my heart. It was the last one to have unit stacking, and there was so much joy in my heart for huge stacks of armies strolling across the map and just demolishing everything in the way. (In Civ6 you can't stack the units, and it's still ""okay"" because you can still have a lot of units around; it just isn't the same!)
The best part of 5 is the number of mods that were available. I think anyone who was addicted to the game probably remembers FFH? It was a great mod and I do not believe it made it into the Steam Workshop, which is a shame.
Anyways, as far as mechanics it is a bit dated, obviously, the graphics aren't perfect...but you can have huge scale wars with stacks upon stacks of units. I am pretty stuck on that, I guess. :X"

10810,"It's like the game is actively trying to make me not play, with giving me shit starts almost literally every time I start a new game. I know this game's been out for a few years, but if you're thinking of buying it, don't"
10811,"I've played it for 46 hours now its definitely a game you should get on a sale and try out some time.
only encountered like 1 or to bugs so it is pretty stable"
10812,great game
10813,I keep trying to play Civ 6 and it makes me wish it was this game.
10814,"This game (403) is hours of fun. It can be played on easy or hard, always a good time, and never the same play through."
10815,i binge play this game every 6 months for 6 hours and then don't touch it again for another 6 months.
10816,My Favorite game series.  I love Civ 5.  Civ 1 was one of the first games i ever played.  Get this one on sale with all the DLC's
10817,Awesome game
10818,stop invading me this isn't funny anymore
10819,This is the game that really got me into gaming! It may not be as pretty as civ 6 but I do think it is the better game.
10820,get high and enjoy the ride
10821,coming back to civ 5 after playing some civ 6. overall more enjoyable i think
10822,"Most hours logged of any game for me. Dont know if thats good or bad. Nice gameplay. Acceptable graphic. Yes I recommend to anyone. Like any Civ Game, you need time with this."
10823,"Very fun game, I have endless hours of fun. Diety AI is impossibly hard to beat because it starts with advantage. That's part of the fun tho ;)"
10824,ja
10825,"Loved when it worked.

I can't seem to get the game to not crash on load these days which is a real shame. It crashes in standard mode on loading, as well as legacy mode.

Civ 6 runs smoothly, and from what I've seen on the forums - a steam update broke civ 5 a bit. 
Either way, It's lame that I can't play the game I purchased."
10826,This game is most enjoyable.
10827,"best of this type
"
10828,good
10829,Its Good
10830,I like it more than Civ6
10831,"Still one of my favorite games, as it has provided me with many hours of entertainment. Would definitely recommend to most."
10832,"City states are much better than in VI. Art style is solid. Makes for a much more enjoyable late game with more horizontal play, due to city states being more important than just bonuses. World Congress is much improved over its later rendition in VI. Overall, this game is better for specific reasons."
10833,best civ game there is!
10834,Its really good!
10835,Amazing game!!!!
10836,yup
10837,"I received Civ free years ago from a friend and thought nothing of it as I was addicted to Total War games at the time. Years down the line, I saw it collecting dust in my Steam library and figured I'd give it a try. It is the BIGGEST time sink I have ever played and I loved every minute of it (except when the AI had unfair advantages - then I just sought to invade/nuke them). An alternate universe where the stakes are decided by psychotic rulers from throughout our history. What could possibly go wrong? The answer: Gandhi with nuclear power."
10838,fun
10839,Still a great game.  Try getting something other than a Domination victory.  It's a lot more fun.
10840,yes
10841,Where did my weekend go?
10842,One of the best games i've played. Gets even better with friends.
10843,"The intensity of starting war with one country and having a city state help you b/c you made friends with them is a great feeling. 
I love the different routes you can take depending on what your starting empire is. This creates a new game play each time around."

10848,Best game of all time?
10849,yes
10850,"Hat off to Sid, he has pulled the rabbit out of the hat with this one"
10851,"This game has added invasive data collection, including email address, hours played, etc.  It has become spyware.  I will not agree to the new EUA and so can no longer play the game, even though I paid for it.  I have enjoyed Civ 2 through 6, but it is now over."
10852,very good game
10853,"A lot better than CIV VI in gameplay and view

graphic effects may be more interesting in Civ VI - but IV and V play still easier.
DO NOT LIKE THE CHILDISH PLAY of the XBOX CIV REVOLUTIONS. . . ."
10854,it is much better than civ vi. Civ vi is terrible.
10855,ONE more turn and I'll write a review.............
10856,"Civ V is my personal favorite strategy game of all time. Maybe it just came in at the right place at the right time, but I love it. I'm very biased towards it but the game is so fun. Playing with friends adds a lot to the game too, blowing each other up and figuring out the best time to screw everyone over.

10861,"Very interesting game & very enjoyable to play it with friends too. I don't tend to play it very much solo, but it is a great time-killer."
10862,wonderful strategy game. well thought out.
10863,One of my favorite ever games. Super fun single player and multi player
10864,fantastic game
10865,Just one more turn......
10866,"This might be the best of all of the Civ games because all of the features gel really well with each other.  Nothing feels tacked on like it sometimes can with other Civ games.  All Civ games are fantastic, but Civ V is one that I will still be revisiting for a long time."
10867,I have spent days on this game. One of my favorite games of all time
10868,"Just...one...more...turn...

Seriously a classic.

10869,great game
10870,Its not a fun game. It ruins your life. It's the best....
10871,this game is fun
10872,better than civ 6
10873,"It's been awhile since I played Civilization, honestly, the first one was the last time I played. But Civ V more than makes up for my lack of experience and pulled me straight in. Just wish I had more time to play, more addictive than Star Craft 2, and that had an okay story line. 10/10."
10874,Is good
10875,It's okay I guess
10876,"Tons of different scenarios to play out, great time killer, all around awesome game. Hard to find things to complain about to be honest, I mostly spend time playing large maps with 9 other civs set to random personalities. Never know what might happen in the next game."
10877,hee haw
10878,"Fucking great
"
10879,The Civ game that doesn't look like Clash of Clans and Moana had a gross love child.
10880,"One of the most straight forward, addicting strategy games out there. If you end up liking this, it's VERY, VERY easy to sink hundreds, thousands of hours out of it. This was the best value for my money I have perhaps ever spent."
10881,"Nice classic game when you don't have the best computer in the world

Had some nice memories of this game years ago, it wasn't a bad empire building experience and still seems like a good game to play with a very nice atmosphere for exploration and civilization development 

Got some issues though that you should know about before getting into this game

If you start a conquest, the ai can somehow force you into a peace agreement and prevent you from continuing your conquest. Basically preventing you from even entering their territory. The game says it is an agreement, but you as the player never agreed to anything. This is definitely a huge flaw in the game and ruins any immersion you might seek in conquering other countries. Game doesn't even let you break this agreement you never agreed to, or tell you when it expires. It's because the games diplomacy is just broken.

Further to this, i've had issues deleting save game files whereby the game kicks you to desktop each save game file you delete. Which is a real problem. Don't know what causes this or how to work around it or fix it other than only have one save file only.

The other thing that was an issue was the religion. If you want to role play as a country that does not adopt a religion that choice is also taken away from you as other countries can spread their religion forcefully onto you, but you cannot expel religion from your lands. So it is just forced on you and there is just nothing fun to interact and fight against it. Really takes away from the otherwise ""control"" you have over your civilization. And just feels like the devs are reaching too far into conditioning the player to accept being subjected to foreign religions and the fact they make all religion a positive is truly not doing reality any justice as historically that was a huge contention for conflict, not extra happiness.

The combat is not as great as other games, like Age of Wonders 3. But it's still ok in its own more basic and very limited way. Some mods at least increase the xp and level choices, which i'd recommend for more extended gameplay options making that aspect more interesting.

Some of the mechanics aren't too well developed and don't really work too well. Also there aren't enough settings to personalise the game to your specific preferences. For example in our multiplayer game, when a friend takes a turn it shifts your screen, so you have to turn that off during simultaneous turns otherwise it will cause you miss clicks and miss orders. But then when you turn that off, you cannot enjoy the combat because it just skips it and also shifts the camera away in a hurry. There is just no middle ground, you kind of just have to endure one of the two bad choices you have.

The other thing the game lacks is a more manageable way to manage certain factors that affect the game. For example happiness makes absolutely no sense. Some cultures were warlike and loved conquering and pillaging etc... So for example the Mongols are historically a people that expanded and conquered and destroyed their foes mercilessly. But this game punishes you for role playing as the Mongols, it just ruins the immersion of the game completely.

There is no setting to hide the social chat window in multiplayer, which takes up more space then necessary and you cannot resize it. It's crazy to think that after all this time and money this dev can't do a better job with their game mechanics.

The game definitely can be less boring playing with a friend.

The other thing that ruined my last gameplay attempt was how poorly the happiness mechanic has been implemented. You lose happiness from everything so basically if you are an expansionist Country like Mongolia, the devs didn't think to give them features to negate that. The game punishes your conquests instead of balancing it. Completely hurting an important playstyle in conquests.

So that game, i'd been sitting outside a place that I intended to conquer for hundreds of turns because I could not accumulate enough happiness to allow another conquest. So basically that game was no fun anymore because this mechanic that punishes you for playing the Mongols the way they should be played. Had to install a mod that allows extra settings to disable the unbalanced broken happiness and religion mechanics.I'd highly recommend that unless you like being dictated by the game at what pace to play it at when conquering.

The game is designed for a very slow progression favouring a spread of aggression through the eras. However, the Mongols shine in one era, so the game does a poor job of allowing the player to also shine in that era that their civ is strong in. So you basically have to consider turning off the eras and techs too, if you want to enjoy a cap on eras. Otherwise the games eras quickly become irrelevant as the game is essentially a boring race through the eras. Which is ok if you like racing through eras. But to me, wanted to enjoy some eras more than others. It's a good thing there is an advanced setting to put a cap on the eras. Can highly recommend that if you just want to enjoy a particular era.

The diplomacy in the game is very basic and spams too much with not enough settings to really manage it adequately. The ai bothers you mercilessly with uninteresting boring offers that are just a waste of time and are terrible to renegotiate deals with.

The game makes no attempt to inform the player on the upkeep costs of each unit prior to recruitment, which really makes balancing economy sometimes a bit of tricky situation since you cannot account for things too easily, so you have to just manually try and estimate it most of the time, which can sometimes lead to misjudging the costs of new later era units.

Can say one other great thing about this game the ingame civilopedia is quite good and the fact there is a well supplied workshop is fantastic."
10882,Just one more turn....

10889,April 2020. Only computer I had access to was a subpar laptop. Was dealing with a lot and quarantined all day. Within that portion of time I mustve racked up nearly all my 200 hours in this. Its gotta be one of the best games of all time.
10890,"One of the best strategy games either solo or with friends. Simple to understand, simultaneously calm and stressful, and lots of options for civilizations and play styles.

10900,"It isn't often I find myself jumping actively between a game and its predecessor. Civ V, however, is a great game that aged beautifully and maintains just enough distinction from VI that I still find myself craving ""the older game"" every once in a while.

Civ V is a charming entry in the civilization franchise. Just like the game that came after it, the music, graphics and interface come together to create a very immersive game. With a huge cast of unique leaders, each match feels like it has plenty of variation - playing the exact same way every game won't work. Civilization V rewards thoughtful planning, situational awareness and the ability to fight tactically. A broad array of mechanics such as religion, ideology, the 'classic' civics trees and city-state interactions can always give you something new to mess around with in each match.

Great game, great price. Worth grabbing all of the DLC though, just like all the civ games."
10901,Secured a cultural victory once.
10902,"I never been very good at this and have played all previous versions prior to this one. Personally this is my favourite version so far thanks to the layout, graphics and interface. Not sure about the city states but at least they give another dimension to the game and I like the way culture can be used to expand your borders."
10903,Dislike losing. Like the different games that can be set for each time you play.
10904," Very good game and spent so many hours playing as different civilizations. After a long while without mods it can get a bit old but there are so many ways to win and build up your civ. that it takes a long time. great game and would recommend, its not a city builder but good strategy game."

10910,"Lost many an hour to this game, especially with the Brave new world dlc/edition of the game. Makes Civ V a more enjoyable game with a lot of different things to do that just solo domination your way to victory. Having over 1000 hours in game and not even getting to play every game mode and not even seeing what the modding community has to offer, shows how much replay value there is to this game. I still play it to this day and will be sticking with it until a new Civ title comes up that hopefully returns to the style of Civ V or at least is better than Civ VI (i wont be holding my breath). However Civ V gets a solid two thumbs way up from me for how much there is to do in the game and how much you pay for it."
10911,"Classic.  Not flashiest, but still solid."
10912,"Turn based strategy does not get better than this. Every game that came after it including popular titles like Stellaris borrows most of its game mechanics from Civ5's rewarding, balanced gameplay. I'd be hard pressed to find a ""4x"" game more revolutionary when released, and still so much fun to play."

10957,"So, let me just start off by saying: No, I'm not a Civ Game knowledge buff, I didn't play any of the previous ones, and I will never play VI again. (Personal reasons mostly, and nothing to do with Sean Bean, love the guy!) 

So I have put a lot of time into this game, mostly because 1) It's fun, and 2) there is a lot of things to do in this game! You have so many civilization choices, especially with the DLC for the game. But, let me just say, I have a lot more fun with diplomacy than I do with domination. But if domination is your think, all the more power to you. If you want to make all the nations kneel before you, or wipe them off the board, go for it, I can't stop you, nor would I have the power to.

I usually play this game with a few custom settings, usually on one of the top 3 highest difficulties, no Barbarians, and I usually set the win condition to Diplomatic, and or Science. But there are several win conditions, including domination. But, if you turn off domination, it won't stop the other nations from beating you to a pulp just to keep you from winning with a Diplomatic or Science victory! In fact, usually they all tend to gang up on you anyways, or so it feels like, so try to make as many allies as possible, and try to advance as quickly early on as you can. 

You can also set teams before you start the game, so if you want an edge over the other nations, you can have an ally from the start of the game if you want to, and divide the other nations up into teams, or leave them to fend for themselves, too. You can also set how many City-States there are, how large your map is, and so on. Watch out for Venice if you ever add City-States, because those City-States are important for later game play, and Venice can literally ruin your win chance at any rate. 

I am pretty sure a lot of people focus heavily on having a city in all the primary land types: Coastal, River, Lake, Desert, and so on so you can make all the wonders you can, right? I mean, if you think about it, wonders do offer decent bonuses, but sometimes their actually not that great overall. Not saying not to build them, but you could focus on advancement for your civilization first, that said, the other nations usually outpace you in the higher difficulties, so take what you can get.

In closing, I tend to play this game sometimes for relaxation, and usually focus on building a unique world. A world that usually ends up being filled up with roads, farm land, outposts, cities, and completely without jungles, and depending on the civilization without forests. I mean, jungles and forests are just resource times, and you can build things in them like roads, but I guess I focus too much on changing the natural world, and building a huge civilization, which basically is what the game is about, right? I mean, you can just surround another nation with Great Generals, and build Citadels around their cities, but where is the fun in that? That's just a fun trick to steal another nation's resources."

10983,.
10984,Better than crack
10985,Its like being a dictator but nobody gets mad at you
10986,Great time especially with a group of friends.
10987,Great game.
10988,"i regret nothing lol 
Ima die now thank you forever"
10989,"Huge time sink, but pretty fun game if you like turn-based strategy and history as I do. It has a looot of features and systems that may come off as intuitive, but really have big depth to them. Been playing for years now, and I'm still finding things I didn't know."
10990,"Absolutely love this game, but Civ 6 go too complicated for my liking, so I just stuck with this version."
10991,"It's alright, I guess"
10992,Great game. If you can finish a game with friends more power to you.
10993,a great game.
10994,"great game, dlcs are a must though. civ 6 shouldve just been a dlc to this. adding districts wouldve been better. i have only  1 mod installed, the 43 civs mod for tsl earth
"
10995,"I have to say. They had me in the first half, not gonna lie. I found this game very enjoyable for the first 10,000 hours or so, but it lost alot of its replay value after that. It became a little repetitive, and i gotta say, it had some negative effects on my personal life as well. My wife was very supportive of my flourishing prowess at this game. From my Ottoman conquest of Constantinople in the year 1453 all the way to forming a coalition to storm Waterloo. However she felt i ""spent too much time"" on the game. What does she fucking know? I've conquered the world countless times, naive little wench. Alas, Civ stayed by my side until i found love again in the form of my second wife, Tammy. Tammy was a wonderful woman, but after 3,000 hours of Civ she to made the ridiculous claim that i played this ""stupid game"" to much, and also left me. With no-one by my side any longer, i was finally free to play as much as i wanted. I threw another 5,000 hours into this game, my one true love. Civilization has never let me down. But time is the one true enemy. And while Civ may have once been the best thing in my life, it has since lost that honor.

 I would not recommend this game to anyone.  If you are thinking of buying this game, do yourself a favor and get yourself a stamp of some quality skag instead. At least with the heroin, you dont need to pay your power bill."
10996,I used game for mostly fun sometimes alot sometimes not much but usually fun also used during work sometimes especially to procrastinate on important deadlines
10997,All the Civ games are great!!
10998,BRO THIS IS SO GOOD I LIKE GAME VERY GOOD AND NICE!!!
10999,.
11000,Best civ
11001,great game
11002,"great game, many different scenarios to play, different downloads to try, overall many hours of strategic fun and would def recommend"
11003,Great game. Better than Civ 6 in my opinion. Buy this instead.
11004,Great on multiplayer. Be ready for a long game ahead...
11005,impossible to win vs someone better than you
11006,good
11007,"Civilization 5 is the single best stratagy game I have every played, I really enjoy it even still after 7900 hours played. Would reccomend to anyone that enjoys history/ alternate histories."
11008,"it is like after the first 2 or 3 civilization games  they just stopped trying. 


Not worth it. 

Quote: Remember that Jesus Christ is the Way, the Truth, and the Life. Probably worth a google?!"
11009,Buy this over Civ 6 you will thank me later
11010,The best of the Civ series
11011,5/5
11012,"If you never played Civ 4 you'd enjoy this, but every change I've noticed is worse: city states add nothing to the gameplay, ending unit stacking just makes attack and defense incredibly messy and tedious, the loss of religion is detractive - it was a very interesting way of exercising soft power, and the UI is now more difficult in terms of queuing future actions like moves and city production, especially the inability to queue a production item in all cities. It stands on it's own as a good game but I can't find a single thing they've improved, and a good many that are worse. The AI diplomacy is arguably better, but its also very buggy, and has a very marginal impact on the gameplay."
11013,"the game can be quite overwhelming at first. I have no idea how to play the game even after going through the tutorial. But after going through multiple tries I finally got the hang of it and actually enjoyed the game. The game is increasingly fun after gaining much knowledge on how to play the game optimally. 

If you have a lot of time to learn through youtube or in the in-game tutorial. I HIGHLY recommend this game.

PROS
- EVEN SUN TZU, A RENOWNED CHINESE STRATEGIST WILL GET JEALOUS OF YOU HAVING TO PLAY THIS GAME IN YOUR GENERATION

CONS
- LEARNING THE FUNDAMENTALS IS A TIME CONSUMING PROCESS IN THIS GAME

8.5/10 overall, this game wont grow old and its the best CIV in the series. I hope the devs decide to go back to its roots (to give a rewarding experience to players who managed to get past the complexity of the game) in the future CIVs"
11014,"uhm
"
11015,"Great Game
"
11016,"This is the peak of civ development right here. I recommend this to new players over Civ VI. It has a more enjoyable aesthetic, a more stable and balanced gameplay, and it's simply more fun."
11017,babylon go brrrr
11018,What do I like about this game? It's not Civ 6
11019,good
11020,I think 3220 hours played says it all.
11021,It sure is Civ
11022,Addicting af
11023,"Best played with all the DLC.
If you try to play a domination victory, good luck."
11024,it is kool
11025,awesomeness
11026,THis game sucks
11027,Fantastic Game.  Best installment of the series. (Have not played 6 yet)
11028,"Even better than Civ 6, The Leonard Nimoy voiced  Civ 5 is  still the quintessential Civilization hitting all the high notes of intellect and turn induced just one more turn anxiety.

Beware, when you finish playing you your kids will learn you have Grandkids and your wearing diapers again..... so you will go back to playing"
11029,"i played this with some freinds, they fell out, things got out of hand, wasnt very civilised
2/10 would not play again. they still arnt talking"
11030,Extremely engaging
11031,this game good
11032,its lit
11033,Best civ game imo!
11034,lol its good
11035,"Still fun, plenty of achievements to work for."
11036,Great game. Manages to be very in depth without being overwhelming for newcommers. One of the best strategy games I've played.
11037,Best game ever
11038,"A very nice strategy game, fun to play with friends and just chill.
The combat is a bit goofy and the multiplayer has some bugs but other than that it's a great game."
11039,This is a dogged cursed game
11040,"FUN GAME
"
11041,It's always different and there are so many ways to play it.
11042,Just. One. More. Turn....Is that the sun coming up?
11043,I like the technological choices you have to make all the time and how these influence the development of a society.
11044,you'll boot this game up at 8 am and wake up at 8pm realising you've done nothing but command and conquer a digital nation
11045,I sit in the corner of the map and watch as my friends fall apart.
11046,Popped Catherine the Great between myself and Napolean 10/10 would recommend.
11047,Still the best Civ game out there. But still I'd recommend to wait for a sale so you get all the DLC's
11048,Not good.
11049,This game is suck.
11050,"its ok
"
11051,all my homies hate CIV VI
11052,"Ehis game is a time warp, U love it!"
11053,yeah its ok
11054,"I've got nearly a thousand hours on this game offline, back when it was still being sold on disc format. Civ 5 is basically the DnD 3.5/ Pathfinder of the franchise. Will kick your ass if you're incapable of learning, mostly fun in multiplayer matches, and very expensive to play. The Gods and Kings dlc and Brave New World dlc are essential, as they add and change SO much of the game, and are really what defines it as the best or 2nd best civ game (proceeded only by civ 4 beyond the sword). If you're considering buying a civ game, this is the best one, and for gods sake avoid civ 6- it's an eye sore."
11055,"good game
"
11056,fun game
11057,I don't like Ghandi
11058,"Quite good, especially if you dont want to waste money on the new one, 7/10."
11059,"The best you'll get for updated Civ, especially IRT multiplayer, not nearly as bogged down as CIV VI
"
11060,Fun
11061,"I love this game, but it is so buggy it is not worth it. I cant even finish a game that I spent hours investing in becomes in keeps crashing on the same turn no matter how many times i reload the save. Not worth buying."
11062,"I'm German, so winning a world war for the first time has been quite rewarding experience. I want to thank the developers for enabling the accomplishment this life long dream."
11063,good
11064,"Civilization 5 is a massive and complex game. It's definitely not for everyone, but if it's for you, play it. This game has so much replay value that if there was a nuclear apocalypse, undoubtedly started by Gandhi, and you had to take one game into an atomic shelter, you should probably take this. Every variation of gameplay in this game is fun. Playing with AIs is fun. Playing with friends is fun. Playing online multiplayer is fun. There are no two sessions that you play of this game that will be the exact same. Even if you get the same character, the random characters of the other players and the randomized terrain and resources provide a unique experience each generation. Although Civilization 6 has been released for some time, this title still holds up as a magnificent game with lots of hours of gameplay."
11065,"fuck u pice of shit riot games
"
11066,I like it
11067,"It is fun but laid back game. Usually I dont play games like this, but this one is good."
11068,"Yea the game is definitely worth it. Community is still active and mods are still being made. If whoever reads this is coming from civ 6, good luck getting over the differences, for everyone else: if you like this genre you'll love civ v."
11069,"Jam packed with loads of things to do.  It's your typical Civ game, with progressive AI but not too over-reaching.  It's fun  but be prepared to waste hours or days."
11070,adddictiive
11071,"Still the best most complete Civ game in the lineup. Endlessly replayable and 3 times more so with friends.
While it may lack some features that are offered in 6 and 4 what it does offer is the most complete experience, It feels more like a renaissance man than a jack of all trades master of none."
11072,Good game
11073,"It's fun
"
11074,"it makes my n
nnuts sweat with joy

"
11075,IT is a amazing game 10/10 better then civ 6
11076,"great game,281 hours and still taking Ghandi nukes 10/10"
11077,I am a Civilization fan since Civ 1. Civ 5 is my favorite game. Definitely recommended.
11078,"By far, the game I have most played in Steam.
Do get the two main DLCs. Without them, the game is a bit rough on the edges."
11079,"Very good and adicting stragegy game that will keep you playing for just one more turn

A big negative is that a lot of achievments don't work with DLCs, so be mindful of that if you want to buy

Also this game is way better than Civilization VI, so buy this game instead"
11080,"fire game 
"
11081, game get hella boring make more exciting and more inticeing for a player
11082,"Tarantula!
Caligula!
Napoleon!
Adolf Hitler!
Lucifer's Own!"
11083,Easily best 4x game I've ever played. It still holds up today it's a must play for any strategy fan
11084,"I played it for over 1200 hours, so I guess I like it"
11085,"I mean, it's okay! I only have 1,000 hours played so far, so I'm not sure yet if I'm the most qualified to leave a review. Nonetheless, I still enjoy it better than the new one! It may be old, but they really struck gold."
11086,boring
11087,Civ V is a great game to just relax and play-can take a break anytime for as long as you want-amazing mods
11088,burger
11089,My girlfriend loves this game so much - If you enjoy sims games and strategy games like polytopia or plague inc. you will probably enjoy this.
11090,Okay I guess.
11091,get nuked by gandhi: the game
11092,its pretty good init
11093,"The game crashes in the late game when playing on huge maps. Gotta manually save every turn so I don't lose progress. I've played several hours before without saving and the game crashed and I stopped playing for months. It's a fun game but they won't ever fix the crashes. 
F"
11094,"Definitely buy this with the DLC.  Civilization V was already an amazing concept/game, but BNW refined it to make it that much better.  Add in mods from the workshop such as True Start Earth maps, Info Addict, Really Advanced Setup, and so many more and you get an absurd amount of content.  I personally prefer this over Civ 6, but you could go either way depending on what aspects of Civilization you're interested in."
11095,:)
11096,it good
11097,It's OK so far. Still trying to finish my first game.
11098,GG
11099,"Even with Civ 6 out for multiple years, Civ 5 still has a lot worth returning to. After playing wide strategies in 6 a lot, it can be very refreshing to come back and play for a ""build tall"" strategy in 5."
11100,This game is fricken awesome
11101,"A great strategy game, but it takes a while to play even a single game."
11102,"Endless hours , and that's even without mods"
11103,Super fun game to play with friends
11104,very nice yes
11105,grat gam
11106,easy to learn but very addictive.
11107,its a great return for the seris
11108,Great game if Owen didnt leave every time we try to play multiplayer
11109,I like it
11110,very good
11111,"The game has interesting concepts and mechanics, but the AI really kills the game. The AI is completely brain dead and gets outclassed mid game to the point where you are just spamming next turn for half the game."
11112,was very pog
11113,Very Fun game :D
11114,science victory is the way of zen
11115,"A solid game to sink hours into with friends, many custom options for game types, great DLC and always a timeless classic to come back to and enjoy, with the gameplay itself being easily manageable, smooth and consistent."
11116,Civ 6 is better
11117,good stuff
11118,super fun for hours and hours
11119,"Yes, it's a great game! Enjoying the game-play."
11120,"This game is good but it messes up ur pc to where it makes your desktop screen slightly zoomed and the way to fix it is to restart the game everytime
"
11121,"Very good fun yes
"
11122,"Started a short game the other day... didn't go to sleep till 5 am, if that's not a good game I don't know what is"
11123,yeet
11124,An amazing game
11125,Yeah it's pretty good
11126,Can't... Stop...
11127,i like the game- Philipe
11128,"This is the best turn-based strategy game I've ever played. I've been playing civilization since I was a child, growing up on CIV 3. In my opinion this game is still the best civilization game, even after CIV 6."
11129,best time sink on the planet tbh
11130,Endless hours of fun
11131,"If you're looking for a fun historically accurate game that lets you go crazy I would strongly recommend the CIV series, the V is my favorite because of the art style only and I would say it's better in my opinion for that reason. GREAT GAME!"
11132,Super fun
11133,"This is one of the best game I have ever played. The quotes after you get a technology are often overlooked but it is truly the best part of this game. Along with that while playing through the game you will learn a great deal about famous/infamous historical figures, honestly could say that i learned more about history from this game than my school history class."
11134,O jogo mais viciante que existe.
11135,I love this game and franchise. Lots of fun and great for solo or with friends
11136,sid meiers
11137,"If you have never played this game, DO IT"
11138,"Very absorbing game. You're always thinking I'll just wait until this research is done, but then the next thing you wanna research is only 2 turns or something and the cycle repeats until you've been playing for 5 hours and your eyes are bloodshot and the sun hurts. Would definitely recommend though :)"
11139,good
11140,its just gd
11141,I have played all the CIV's and this has got to be my fav !!!!
11142,very fun stratagy game with all kinds of different endings.

11148,A wonderful time sink.
11149,Super
11150,funhj
11151,Best Civilization game ever!
11152,"IMO, this game is better than Civ 6.

6 tried to change too much, Civ 5 embodies that classic Civ-style game play."
11153,kjb
11154,Multiplayer is bad but it's addicting in a single player mode.
11155,"A familiar time waster, I can enjoy without  getting bogged down in a long learning curve."
11156,Definitely the best Civ game
11157,"I have like another 300 hours of this game on a pirated version, but I liked it so much that when I got the money I buy it and I still love. I am not a strategy game person, but CIV V got me so fast, at the begining if you havent played another Civ it may be a little boring but when youu get the idea and start to understand everything you start playing at night and when you realize its the next day, its so adictive this game 9/10"
11158,I recommend this if you want to spend days of your life playing a single video game.
11159,I love this game.  Been playing it off and on since release and I always come back to it.  The community mods fixed all the things I ever had issues with.  My favorite Civs game
11160,Wasted so many hours on this shit (outside steam). Totally worth it.
11161,"I like it...it's never the same game twice
"
11162,Good
11163,i like this game
11164,It is quality game
11165,The best Civ entry
11166,"Great game, well worth playing."
11167,very good game
11168,Love this game!!
11169,very fun
11170,"Actually have more hours than 300h shown on profile, just not counted by Steam/offline, and one could easily play even multiple times that.
IMO the best and most fun to play out of Civilization games so far. 
It does have some bugs and problems, glitches, rounding/display issues, funky mechanics, WEAK AI, etc. etc... but at the end of the day, most of these are not really gamebreaking and it's still very fun to play, ESPECIALLY with other people :-)

I recommend you to look for some sales for Complete edition with it, grab the game with all DLCs at once and get ready for a many, many days of fun, dencouncement, enjoyment, dencounciation, annoyance, denouncement and gameplay.... 
...did I already mentioned that you will get happily DENOUNCED by your friends, foes and other random nations almost every single game? Yes? No? Whatever! You will quickly learn the tricks and tactics that will let you get through whatever happens ;-)"
11171,better than Civ 6
11172,"i forgot that 27 hours have passed, proves how addicting it can be"
11173,It's alright...
11174,it is a relaxing turn based game without all the stress and bs of a mmorpg  or a shooter
11175,The best strategy game ever.
11176,Still better than Civ VI lmao
11177,I love getting immersed in this brilliant game.  It is so engaging and detailed in that every aspect of life has to be considered from economy to government to foreign relations and dealing with barbarians.  I have happily lost many hours to this game and continue to play it years after I bought it.
11178,best game ever
11179,This game ruined my life
11180,Extremely absorbing.
11181,Great game. One of the best in the Civilization series.
11182,Gandhi crushed all my hopes and dreams.
11183,an amazing game
11184,Makes my nether regions tingle. Would buy again!
11185,old but still great
11186,One more turn.
11187,Excellent
11188,I dont like it. Like Pauline Hanson to a lot of minorities I dont like this at all and want it gone.
11189,"Very playable, very fun, and looks much better than the previous versions. The only shortcoming IMO is the inability to stack units. This game is an easy way to while away down time. 
Recommended, unlike 6"
11190,great strategy game
11191,love this game
11192,i hate england
11193,Pretty alriight good for killing a few hours
11194,nice
11195,"Civ 5 is a  much better game than 6. its graphics, interface, and a few game mechanics are not as good, but the game is significantly more refined and there aren't gimmicks in the game play like the districts of 6"
11196,It's aight
11197,"Pretty sure I've played for more than the hours on record. 
Quite fun, I would recommend."

11205,shit is good yo
11206,fun
11207,"This is one of those brilliant games that stand the test of time. I find myself getting back to this over and over again whenever that new shiny game loses its appeal.
 Definitely a must have."
11208,Civ 6 is shit.
11209,All time classic
11210,This one is good. 6 has the dopest looking characters I ever saw. So I won't even try it.

11238,"This is worse than cocaine, you will have nightmares about japanese people invading your town, this pain in the ass unstable russian lady trying to humiliate you in front of her court saying nasty stuff about your army, they will try to dimish you, they will try to invade your towns and conquer your women, behold normal human being this is the possibility of managing your empire without real petty politics, child tantrums and peasants complaining about taxes, this is a slight possibility of power, apex of the best and worst of men, burn villages so you can eat crab and yet you will come back to fight over fish meat and be humiliated by the same russian lady over and over again as a manchild goes on and on about how the world is unfair and thats why the world should change and not himself"
11239,Good strategy game. Fun to play.
11240,"excellent replay value
"
11241,Pog
11242,"Best Civ V game imo. You start playing a game, and suddenly when you look at the clock it's two months from when you started."
11243,A lot of fun and that's all it needs
11244,"Gamer Rating:8/10 

Strategy, Education, connection. 

Are you looking to conquer the world with Greece? Rome? Egypt? This may be the only Sid Meier Civ game i've played but the experience was great. Looks way better then Civ VI even! If you enjoy Age of Empires than you'll love this!"
11245,Pretty good
11246,Have been a fan of this series since #2.
11247,dont buy this or your day will literally be shortened by a few hours.  It's a fucking time machine

However DLC like brave new world is almost necessary."

11252,i dont even remember buying or playing this game
11253,poggers
11254,A really fun game but is a SUPER fun game if you buy ALL of the DLC sadly.
11255,Its okay I guess.
11256,Great Strategic Game.
11257,Its a great Game to play.
11258,Very cool game

11269,5 stars
11270,I have 300+ hours in this game guys come on
11271,"I've sunk so many hours into this game. It's slow paced enough to play it in the background, and it's intense enough to want to focus solely on it for hours. It's a great game for strategy, empire building, and much more."
11272,There is Only One and this or civ 6 are the best  they do what they say on the box
11273,Still beter then civ 6
11274,F U N !!!
11275,Addictive like crack cocaine
11276,"Without a doubt my desert island game. I still learn something new every time I play it. There are layers of complexity to it and the learning curve can be steep, especially if you're new to the series, but it's worth it. Probably one of the only games I can play that can kill 3-4 hours easily. I'll always come back to Civ 5."
11277,"Liked it when i was a kid, never was able to buy it. Now i am grown man and bought it, and now I am a very happy grown man"
11278,One of the greatest 4x games ever made.  I'd probably recommend this over Civ VI if you forced me to choose.
11279,good
11280,I find it to be more fun with friends. Learn in single player and then it will be even more fun. It has a big learning curve
11281,played this game for years and haven't found anything close

11301,"One... More... Turn...

Verdict
☐ STAY AWAY FROM THIS!
☐ I would not recommend this
☐ You may get this on sale :)
☐ I would recommend this
☑ PLAY THIS BEFORE YOU DIE!"
11302,"I used to play the previous civilization games, I thought I was in love with civ IV, but this one is also pretty nice. If you have played civilization games before, there are some new additions:

pros: You can still micromanage your cities, assigning your citizens wherever you think is more convenient.

There is a lot of new policies that sometimes reward you with units, research, great persons, etc.

The aleatory BS is over: a samurai is not going to destroy your tank, just because of some virtual dice, now it is more about stats, advancements, and the power of said unit.

There are new future units, Giant walking robots of death and destruction, and there's even a surprise for Xcom fans.

The stack of death is gone... and that is bad and good, but it makes more sense. Now you need to put a little more thinking into how are you going to deploy your units, because each military unit can't be on the same tile.

Cities are more powerful now: in previous games, you could just walk into a city to conquer it if it didn't have somebody to protect it. Now cities can defend by themselves.

Cons: You need to keep your citizens happy, there is a lot of ways to keep them merry, but for example, if you are conquering lots of cities, you need to finish happy buildings... Policies can help you a lot, still the citizens want specifically the luxury that you don't have, and just as in real life, they want more and more and more.

The independent nations... I hate those guys, basically you need to waste your money and time on these guys, yeah they can give you units, and special resources or luxuries... but they like to sway away from you, pretty often.

Everybody is denouncing you for some unknown reason, even your friends are going to do it.

The other nations know exactly what your citizens need as a luxury. So if my citizens want exactly fur to be happier, and the only other nation in the game is america and it has three available furs, They are not going to give it to you for another luxury... they need lots of them. This doesn't make sense, but fine, you won't give me a fair deal.. I take it by force ¬¬

Dead civilizations can come back to life. Don't give an enemy city of a forsaken enemy to one of your ""allies"", they are going to liberate the city and the prick is going to, you guess it, denounce you...

Overall is a good game, you are going to waste looooots of time into it, and the music, art, etc are really a nice touch."
11303,"I can easily spend hours in this game. This game has my attention from the very beginning, strategizing what I should do next. If you need a game that you could easily spend hours of your day playing without realizing that time has slipped away into a void, then this is the game for you."
11304,one more turn
11305,It is awesome.
11306,Gem of a game
11307,b
11308,fun game
11309,best game ever.. period
11310,.
11311,The graphics are great and add to a more enjoyable gaming experience.
11312,enjoy
11313,nice
11314,"By far one of the best games in my library, this game is an endless source of entertainment. just one... more... turn"
11315,"Hey, I have a free hour, might as well start a game of Civ.

[i] 6 Hours Later... [/i]

Aaaaand done... Wait shit I forgot to eat dinner"
11316,It's a fun turn by turn based game that can easily go for hours
11317,"I swear since Civ 6 they have been making Civ 5 worse: the stuck auto explorer, the unfair spawn etc."
11318,"love it ! take your time to understand this game, it's not easy at the beginning but it's worth your time!"
11319,"Have played CIV since CIV I.  Some versions better than others, but I play CIV V all the time.  When I want a challenge, but don't need to understand 40 pages of rules, I play CIV.  Spent many a night playing one more turn to only realize suddenly that it was 4 AM.  This game I can play when all the others take too much energy."
11320,10/10 civs for days
11321,"Despite having played Civ 6 already, I still find this game to be extremely enjoyable. Even without the DLC, new players starting Sid Meiers Civilization can enjoy a really well designed game. It's not too complicated to turn off new players and it's also not too simple for the gameplay to feel repetitive. Gameplay is extremely enjoyable and I find that I pass time faster than I think while playing."
11322,"Just PLAY and see :)
"
11323,Probably the game I play most often. It's easy to learn and fun to play. Never have any problems with it.
11324,great game
11325,very nice
11326,"much better than civ 6. 

No need to make a game super realistic and complex like in civ 6."
11327,"Fun, classic, well-rounded 4X strategy game."
11328,Turn based is boring!
11329,GOAT
11330,Such a great strategic game. Highly recommended!
11331, bjn
11332,its a ok game
11333,"Extremely fun, especially if you are able to play a local multiplayer match. My brother and I are currently playing a game where he funds my war campaigns and I wreak havoc across the globe in his name. It is a much different play style than a single-player science victory campaign, but my goodness both are glorious. I would definitely recommend this game to anyone who enjoys strategy games! Give it a go!"
11334,I love this game!!
11335,.
11336,Has replayability
11337,rule coumtry
11338,"genghis khan keeps building world wonders, solid game though
"
11339,fun game
11340,straight crack
11341,closest thing to time travel
11342,"Fuck you Alexander the Twink.
In a serious note, this game loves to suck up every hour of your day and with lots of replay value in it. Each Civ has traits and sometimes buildings that are meant for certain victory condition like diplomacy, culture, science and war. It ain't Total War since you'll be on everyone's hit list for taking over a city even if you aren't the aggressor but that won't stop you.
Also Catherine the Thot keeps settling near my fucking capital in the middle of no where..."
11343,Fun
11344,gg
11345,"The game is good, my computer can't go with civ 6, so i decided go with this and i loved it"
11346,Every game is different.
11347,contint like
11348,"What can I say... other than.... LOVE THIS!

11349,BEST GAMES IN WORLD END OF STORY
11350,WOW
11351,"The game plays very well moves quickly very little hesitation between player , computer,  turns. I love solo play games and this one plays great."
11352,"Great MP game, relaxing with a good soundtrack. This is truly a classic turn based RTS
"
11353,I like this game
11354,GANDHI'S GOT FUCKING NUKES!
11355,griddy widdy gameplay
11356,"I like the balance of the game and the fact that you don't have to fully understand the game at first to have fun with it due to the difficulty settings. It's different from civ 4 and civ 6 with it's own balancing mechanic and AI. AI is really fun because it can be aggressive and start backstabbing. As you learn the game, it becomes more fun and the mods make it's replayability better. Get all the DLCs for this game, it's worth it."
11357,The game moves to slow as in game play. I use to like this game in the past but not anymore.
11358,"Deceptively simple. Wasn't a fan initially, but after my friend gave me a tutorial game teaching me the basics I was hooked! Even if you don't like it initially, I cannot recommend it enough."
11359,"I have already liked the game , from my first 3 hours , and i want to share my thoughts with you . 
Its not the same with Age of empires , it requires strategy to another level , and its very good and new starter friendly game to unterstand the ideology of these games ,
I would strongly Suggest you to buy the game , it worths for the money they sell it , i Grab it of course in a discount bundle , and i am happy about all those DLC that they made great work there also . 
If you Find the oportunity to Buy Full collection of Sid meier's its a nice choice also , becauce their older games are also good , this is just the revolution n the story line !
Grab a cold beer , chips , and upgrade your Skills by the experience that comes while you play the game ."
11360,"This game is amazing, even with civ VI out. It definitely has things that are better than VI but also things that are worse. Buy it if you don't have VI and if you do still do on sale because it's worth it."
11361,
11362,"A good way to eat away the hours, and to lose more in they you might expect."
11363,venice dog
11364,get this on sale and wait for civ VII

11369,Great game.  Better than civ 6
11370,A Classic.
11371,Oh god. That many hours?
11372,Uh oh I started and completed a whole new game in one day again oops oh gosh oh jeez
11373,"The game decides that workers no longer complete construction correctly midway through a game. The AI also has an uber cringe way of declaring war on you, then denouncing you for defending yourself, then using that denunciation to have all the AI empires gang up on you and attack you again. Of course you can win easily because the AI is braindead. Still great fun."
11374,The Best
11375,"I've always loved Civilization since Civ3, and so far the 5th edition is still awesome"
11376,I've never enjoyed being a scrub so much
11377,No replay value
11378,1000+ hours in one of my favorite games of all time.
11379,"Best strategy game ever. After playing this, you will feel that other strategy games lack of depth."

11399,I am now racist to races I never knew
11400,Timeless classic
11401,timeless game.  You can play over and over again
11402,very good game
11403,awesome game as usual
11404,"Considered ""one of the classics"" in the strategy genre. If you haven't played Civ already you really should. Very simple to understand and a blast with friends (just be prepare to make your friends rage after nuking them)"
11405, gameplay is good
11406,"I love starting a game and zoning out. For a simple looking game, the strategy and resource management runs deep. Every time I get decently far I want to start out and see how another civilization works. Some are Military, Religions, and trading based with bonuses in certain areas. I love it, def would recommend to anybody who enjoys a turn based strategy game."
11407,GREAT GAME.
11408,gandhi bad
11409,"I WAS BUILDING POTTERY AND NOT ATTACKING ANYONE CAW CAW

THEN THE HOST KICKED ME CAW CAW 

GREAT GAME, BETTER THAN BAD RATS CAW CAW"
11410,I like the scenarios.
11411,gud game
11412,Better then this it doesn't come
11413,Me likey
11414,"Incredible Replay Value. Literally no other game has anywhere close to the replayability of the CIV games. If you're thinking about getting CIV 6 think about your core values. Are you a child? Are you developmentally disabled? Are you thinking of regressing to a younger, more chlidlike version of your adult self? If you answered yes to any of these questions by all means join the rest of the infantile population that traded complexity for baby graphics. If you are a MAN and you want to LOSE 50 TIMES TO GET ONE ACHIEVEMENT then Civ 5 is the game for you. 

5/7 this jew highly recomends no krappa"
11415,"It is so addictive. I didn't think I'd like turn-based games... I was also a complete fool. Do yourself a favor and set aside an entire day, you will not want to step away from the screen. It's so much freaking fun."
11416,"Great strategy game! I actually prefer the visual design of this one to Civ VI. The gameplay is interesting for both this one and VI, in different ways."
11417,Still a great game sense Civ VI has come out. Different strategy. really fun game.

"
11435,"After close to 350 of playing CIv 5, I can tell you that one more turn is never just one more turn. This game is an addiction. Watching your empire grow from turn to turn, building wonders, confronting enemies, and managing cities hasn't been funner."
11436,"Really an interesting title. loads to do and you can play really in your own style. i tend to grow economically and trade my money but my brothers are all into warfare and growing their armies. you can do any kind of way to win; economy, war, you can do diplomacy. every game is different so explore the options!"
11437,"Somehow, I always end up recreating the Soviet Union: communist state that takes over anyone in its path, and by force."
11438,k
11439,"This series has been a mainstay of my gaming life for decades...telling my age a bit. This version is to date, my favorite and have been playing since it was released. Even coming back after the next version was tried."
11440,I tried to play civ 6 but...there is no comparison. This game is brilliant
11441,Awesome game!
11442,Gandhi with a nuke lol
11443,Gandhi nukes me every match 10/10
11444,"Its good if you have hours to sit and play and take turns. Not for me personally, however as a fan of the total war games I can say its a very good game."
11445,Keeps crashing on MacBook Pro - otherwise great game
11446,Very easy to get into.
11447,colorful and thought provoking
11448,"Ive never played the previous Civ games but i have played both beyond earth and Civ 6 however i always find myself coming back to this one. Beyond earth is different but 6 is just not close to how good this one has been, over 600 hours i can still play the base game which for me is impressive for a game with mod support.

9/10"
11449,"i liked the variety of things you can do in this game. my favorite thing was the warfare but if you like things such as peace there is options of peace you can research new tech and get to space you can do all sorts of things. if you like farming alot do what i did and make all free tiles farmlands, although my favorite part is the damage nukes do and the way war works that might not ber your thing but over all this is a great game."
11450,I love Civ III Civ V is Civ III with better graphics

11461,this is pog
11462,It's ok.
11463,"It is pretty good, I guess."
11464,"this game is fantastic if you enjoy playing god, you can destroy people and their homes which is what i love about this game, i once nuked a city 12 times for fun, i highly suggest  this game for everyone, aside from the destruction the game is also fun  and enjoyable as a strategy game.

10/10 would blow up a city again"
11465,"Fuck 2k, there was no reason why they couldn't make this game 64 bit on windows. Lazy company that just wants money and doesn't care about their community."
11466,Amazing game! recommended for history lovers
11467,What can you say about CiV - been around a long time. Great game.
11468,better than Civ 6 with Vox Populii

11470,2021 and its still Op
11471,"The game is really good, like really good. Been playing since 2014 and I still enjoy the game. The mechanics are good, game has a LOT of content and the graphics are overall enjoyable. 
When you win the game once you can play it again using different tactics, leaders or just playing better with the knowledge how. 
I recommend this game to everyone who enjoys these types of games!"

11520,"I bought it less than two weeks ago and it has quickly become an addiction of mine. It's a great game for casual gamers trying to get into strategic games with a variety of settings and options to make the game easier, provides a lot of helpful tips and advice throughout the game, and comes with a very nice interface. It also appeals to more hardcore strategy players with some incredibly harsh difficulty settings and complex combat."
11521,"Greatest UI of any Civ. It has a clean, elegant, and nostalgic feel that keeps you coming back year after year."
11522,"simple, educating and much fun"
11523,Good
11524,"As with any Civ game, there's a ton to learn and figure out how to optimize, easy to pour a ton of hours into."

11526,Its Sid's Civ why else?
11527,"probably good game for those who like this type of games...

for me it was more of a ""work"" than ""enjoying"" .... a.k.a exhausted, bored, annoyed me. So yeah not my cup of tea.. not gonna even bother doing the usual ""review"" format than what I do usually as I just wanna mark this game dropped."
11528,Just One More Turn
11529,my favourite game
11530,yes
11531,The absolute very best way to loose several days in a row whilst becoming unreasonably emotionally angry at the actions of civilisations run entirely by your computer.
11532,Best version since civ and civ 2.
11533,"very good gam, fuck you if you take my great library
"
11534,This game is soooo good. I honestly can't stop playing it. There are like so many things to do its amazing
11535,"The perfect strategy game, takes a while to learn but when do you learn this game is so much fun. A suggestion is to buy the deluxe edition so you get all the dlc's since the game is way funnier with it. You can play against bots, friends and/or multiplayer. The bots could be better tho tbh, after a while you kind of learn how the play and you can cheese them to win easy."
11536,It feels right :)
11537,good game
11538,Pog
11539,Its okay I guess.
11540,"Bruh...

civ."
11541,this game is fun
11542,Yea its ok
11543,I liked how Ghandi pulled me upside down by my feet and raped me till I was back in the ancient era. 11/10 would buy again.

11554,"i have played this game for almost 80 hours and have still only gotten 26 achievements. There are almost 300 achievements

11557,noice
11558,Very good! One..... more... turn.....
11559,"Easy to pick up, very difficult to master and almost worth playing soley so you can nuke all your friends hard work."
11560,"My first Civilization game, and to be honest it is not what I expected from the past entries.  I looks like some of the older game options were cut out to ease in new players like me.  I still find the game very enjoyable, and quite relaxing when you just want to micro manage on a turn base style game."

11563,its great
11564,"Civ is a black hole. You think you'll only play for one more hour. Next turn, next turn, next turn... and its 6 am."
11565,gud
11566,Civ 5 What's not to like!? Clean game play. Simple yet fun mechanics. Boom!

11569,Neat.
11570,cool
11571,The game I've played the most but finished the least.
11572,"Civilization should be a city management game first and a battle game second. 1-unit per tile is a mistake. The Civic government screen just lets you keep adding stuff instead of letting you trade one system for another: gone is the thrill of changing your political system when going to war.
Also, the Civilopedia had hyperlinks since Civ2 but they are no longer here.
Even Civ4 had the ""City View"": you could zoom in any city to watch its buildings. That's also gone forever.

The main music for ""Gods & Kings"" is good, though. The tourism concept from the second expansion is also good."
11573,good game
11574,I'm learning history.
11575,"I love this game. Doesn't appeal to everyone, but if you're into this genre, you will find yourself playing until 4am on a week night and drag your tired ass to work/school the next day where you'll be wishing to be back at the computer with some hot chocolate as you watch your empire flourish. I don't play that often anymore, but not a month goes by without at least 2-3 games."
11576,-
11577,"From the 1st generation Civ game to Present, there is truly no other PC game I'd rather be playing.
The Civilization series are incredibly educational and strategically challenging."
11578,"One of the best games I ever played.
But I only recommend it with all the DLCs.
Fun to play alone, has a great modding community and good to play in multiplayer.
The only problem with the game is that it can fail when in multiplayer and that it can be hard to play with more than 4 people."
11579,Ghandi make big boom
11580,Best game ever.
11581,"A classic.  It calls Civ IV's bet, and then goes all in."
11582,good.
11583,greatest strategy game u can lose days and days in this one
11584,"Absolute time thief, great multiplayer game"
11585,the game is timeless
11586,"Great game except it freezes up after turn 300 or so, was because old laptop bought a new and better one, worked for awhile,which was great but back to freezing up again. Get to the point in the turn where I choose production for each city, but it wont let me have the menu to select anything and move forward with the turn!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
11587,"It's super easy to click ""next turn"" for 10 more turns after your ""last turn"""
11588,everything
11589,Best 4x Game i played. Mods are recommenedet but not necessery. ads alot tho.
11590,Fun game
11591,This game ruined my life in a good way. 11/10 would recomend.
11592,"Still playing it to this day, what else can I say"
11593,"Civ V Brave New World is an older game, but balanced, fun, and even after literally hundreds of games, sometimes still surprises me.  I've played Civ since 'Multiplayer Gold Civ2', and I've enjoyed all of them, including 6... but Civ 5 BNW is the one I come back to.
It has all the best elements of later play (religion, espionage, etc.)
Highly recc!"
11594,"Sid Meier's Civilization V is boring, for realz."
11595,
11596,"Best game ever. So simple yet so complicated. After 1000 hours I still don't know a lot of stuff, incredible."

11606,What day is it? Oooo! New city state!
11607,I just try to make nice and friendly civilization with a lot of culture. All I have are warriors; friends attack me with war elephants and knights. I instantly go to single-player.
11608,stink
11609,MUAHAHAHAHAHAHA I LEAD THE REVOLUTION

11619,its good
11620,One word: wonderful
11621,it fun
11622, overall great game.
11623,"I still keep coming back to civ 5 for more and of course time flies by and before i know it, it is 3am."
11624,The first game I ever played on PC. Its the entire reason its the main platform I use today.

11627,Its good
11628,i love the game unless the game cheats witch is hardly not ever
11629,Does not look like fortnite.
11630,still a winner
11631,"This version is nice, a few things frustrated me but mods have fixed those and I now enjoy playing. 

Civ 4 is still better, but mods make civ 5 nice enough to recommend."
11632,"The (game) year is 1975 I have subverted America in the World Congress so that the Shoshone Nation can act as host. I am on the verge of launching a prolonged war against Order. I am fighting for Freedom. Against America.......

Reality simulator 11/10"
11633,"This is a good game, but:
It eats a lot of memory for what it is. 
It is really really slow if you do not have a very powerful computer and graphics card.
It is slow paced and takes a long time per game. 
It is addictive. 
This is not really a graphics lovers game
"
11634,"i like military victory. its very america, yknow? also satisfying to connect all your cities and absolutely crush england #americaisthebest"
11635,best civ game
11636,You love or hate Civ series. There is no between.
11637,Just one more turn before I will write a proper review...
11638,"Best Civ Game.
"
11639,Sick this
11640,its fun
11641,Manly
11642,Endless strategy.  I love that the game is different every time you play!
11643,very satisfying
11644,Its pretty chill
11645,cool
11646,"Like previous versions it's addicting. Unlike CivVI, the availability of a MOD called ""Ingame editor"" makes it possible to play the game as something other than a war game! In other words, you can often play for a cultural or scientific victory without being forced to engage in war."
11647,good
11648,yes
11649,"It is good
"
11650,"great startergy game, still good compared to the new high quality games, fun to play!"
11651,"A true masterpiece.

If you want a good Civilization game just buy this, VI is on steroid."
11652,it's a trap.
11653,This game is great for passing time. Keep an eye on the clock! 3 AM creeps up quickly with this game.
11654,"An icon, and a real gravity well for time."
11655,A fantastic  time killer game
11656,"This game is very easy for a man of my talents such as myself. I like many others such as myself am a GOD at this game. Every time I play I just gain control over the world congress by accident even. (Just because I'm so good that even when I'm not trying I can achieve this amazing, incredibly difficult, downright CULT LEADER WORTHY feat) Then after I have done this I embargo people I don't like and then change the world ideology and religion just so I can get more votes. If someone threatens me nukes are gone so that's not an option and a standing army tax is instated. You might be thinking ""well what if everyone just goes against you"" and I'd like to point out that that's not even possible because, I only play against level one AI and don't finish an online game if even one thing goes wrong. Sure I could play the game a different way like when I only had one DLC and the world congress wasn't a thing to better challenge myself and enrich my gameplay experience, but that sounds dumb and lame and stupid you stupid butt face. Like what kind of NERD goes for a culture victory or a cringe religious one when you can just be a chad like me with a big dong and bulging muscles taking over the world congress. 

Okay Game 7/20 Gandi Nukes"
11657,Absolutely addictive.
11658,YES
11659,Crashed 4 hours after my last save 10/10 would next turn again
11660,fun
11661,Fun game to pass the time...where there is time.
11662,"7/10 - An overall fun game, but lacks serious didgeridoo dynamics not too the mention the absence nation of Australia. To improve consider implementing didgeridoo music from either Dave Hudson or Lewis burns."
11663,Fun game to play in the evenings after work to get away from everyday life
11664,Better than civ6 in every way. hopefully civ7 will be much closer to this than civ6.
11665,"One of the more addicting games I've ever played. I haven't played any other Civ games, so I can't compare versions. The game is great, give it a shot. Worth $30-$40."
11666,I like to nuke people.
11667,"1. Start a game with friends
2. Have someone get rushed down and killed
3. Have that friend rage quit
4. Continue game until obvious winner 
5. Don't finish game and repeat to step 1"
11668,"It's a fun game that, even though you say just one more turn then you'll get off, you keep going lol."
11669,Incredible time sync. Scratches a certain itch....
11670,Apparently I like this game - GothGoth
11671,this game fucckkss so hard
11672,the happiened is pretty anoying but it is a balenceing feature but in my opinion cities is the heart of civ and the whole point is settleing as many as fast as possible and if you are not doing that you are likely to be out competed which often leves me at -12 to -21 happynes
11673,"I have played civ since it first came out in the early 90s. I must say that multiplayer of civ 5 is the most fun part of it. Playing with multiple humans gives the most challenge although against the limited AI in deity mode its a challenge in the beginning. 
Always fun to return to a round even after having played this for 1000 hours now."
11674,By far the best of the Civ series. Civ6 has more expansions and is still worse than Civ5. I wish they'd remaster Civ5 and give it an update.
11675,time isnt real
11676,Still my favorit game
11677,Better than Civ 6
11678,"Way more interesting than it looks, always find way to improve. Great replayability"
11679,"It's good, I wasted many a day on this. You most definitely need the two add-ons though otherwise it's one big bugfest and not so interesting."
11680,Such a fun strategy game
11681,"They keep making more, but you know when you hit that point that would be your Zenith, but the itch for more follows it? When you end up Leroy Jenkins-ing on a King of the Hill game when you should have waited for the right moment; all because you just wiped a whole squad. This is the moment before that. When you decide to hold out and plan your attack, and this is the Chicken Dinner of Civilization. Highly recommended, 10/10 would play again."
11682,Essential game for any strategy fan. Best played with friends although the AI is ok.
11683,"i nuked some dude in order to extort him for land, and fuelled my neo-imperialist ideals. would recommend for parties, lonely weekends, or wedding receptions"
11684,shits ass
11685,ive spent more of my life playing than im happy to admit
11686,"epic strategy game, i constantly find myself coming back to it again and again"
11687,"Hmm yes, war fun."
11688,it gud
11689,its good
11690,play for 18 hours and eventually nuke alexander the great
11691,"Still ranks as one of the best 4x games I've ever played.
The modding scene is expansive."
11692,Quality game
11693,"Civilization V is a game full of paranoid contrast. It is a well polished, well animated and a joyously welcoming experience. It's a game designed to make you feel good for commandeering great armies and never losing your units. You will be making money and expanding your realm, as the meager walls of your enemies crumble under the vociferous roaring of your cannons and muskets. There is no way to go but up and cutting down forests your people once cherished for health and good fortune is only a natural step in the evergoing march of science and progress. While it's commendable to see a timely developer staying current on modern design trends, there is no denying that Civilization's target audience has changed, and what was once a genre-defining series has now reached past the point of mediocrity, with fewer ways for savvy players to express themselves.

The biggest and most glaring issue with Civilization V is the AI of the computer-controlled opponents and the diplomacy screen in general. Rival leaders often act in unrealistic, or even downright idiotic manner. Grand strategies have always suffered from subpar AI on the field of tactical prowess, but in the previous installments of Civilization, you could at least expect them to be consistent. Leaders would develop animosity or sympathy towards each other, and worked diligently towards the goal which mostly suited their interests. As a result, nourishing good relations with rival factions could take hundreds of turns, and meaningful compromises had to be made if the player desired to befriend a particularly capricious leader. Do you want to placate the warmongering neighbor, or are you going to get ready for war? In Civilization V, rival factions veer between neutral, distrustful, hostile and friendly, with no tangible reasons to back their behavior up. Often times they will denounce the leader who had done something to appease them, like being their trade partner or liberating their capital.

Religion in Civilization V has much larger economic ramifications than in any previous installment, but its political merits have completely vanished. Discrepant faiths no longer spark tension between states and there is far less incentive to try and be the founder. There isn't even a way to choose a state religion in order to bolster relations with neighboring countries. If you have ever paid attention at the history class, you may be aware of why this not only comes across as contrived, but also insultingly ignorant. 

There are fewer ways to interact with other countries in general. Absent is the option to inquire other leaders about their opinion of others and because of this, the decision to declare war is even more of a gamble, because I never know whom am I going to anger by attacking somebody. Instead, waging any war at all yields the warmonger penalty, which indicates the degree to which the AI-controlled leaders are afraid of somebody. All leaders have an enormous distaste for aggressive civilizations, which seems like a cop-out to further penalize players who enjoy waging war. In the previous game, leaders such as Alexander, Genghis Khan or Montezuma would be more likely to become allies with their warlike peers, especially since their choice of civics would most likely align (e.g. theocratic nations are friendlier towards other theocratic nations). Countries which shared religion would be largely indifferent towards warmongering against heathen cultures regardless, which was often crucial to establishing long-lasting alliances. Civilization V's equivalent of civics, social policies, do not affect the relationships between civilizations until the modern era, making politics feel like they barely matter in foreign affairs. Allow me to let you on a little secret: in the olden days, war was seldom frowned upon as the universal evil in the same way it is nowadays. When the rival civilizations aren't busy denouncing each other, they keep bombarding the player with trade offers so menial that they are practically a waste of time. Most civilizations will never trade a luxurious resource in a 1:1 ratio; instead, they demand that the player gives up every single one of their unique resources. If I'm interested in negotiating a luxurious resource, I need to appease my citizens, and the last thing that'll accomplish that is giving up twelve other resources that barely get the job done.

The culture mechanic is one step forward, two steps backwards from the last game. It's great that it builds towards tangible goals, thanks to the social policy system, but the civics window is inexplicably gone, dramatically reducing the breadth of options that used to be available to the player. As a result, many technologies have completely lost their bite, since now they usually unlock buildings or units, instead of options that affect civilizations on a global scale. On top of that, civics in prior games were catering towards certain playstyles, which had a domino effect on the political scene, much like it would in reality. The more lenient policies, like free religion, allowed civilizations to avoid nasty political repercussions at the cost of weaker economic or military presence.

Global happiness is another mechanic which was likely introduced as part of the developer's attempt at streamlining the game, and its inclusion is questionable at best. There is no reason for the citizens in an empire to grow weary and cease food production, only because a tiny city at the other side of the world, whose citizens probably don't even speak the same language, is experiencing unrest. The ways to remedy those issues lack the creative dilemmas bestowed upon the player in prior installments and are mostly relegated to constructing specific buildings. Unlike in Civilization IV however, the tradeoffs for them are very limited. Civilization IV had two buildings designated for money-oriented cities, the market and the grocer, one offering extra happiness, the other offering health. Their closest equivalents in Civilization V, the circus and the zoo, are only there to provide happiness and are pretty much necessary for any expansionist player. Another way of appeasing the citizens was through creative manipulation of certain civics, such as the Hereditary Rule, which was in every way inferior to policies available later on, but kept the population in check. Again, somewhat grounded in reality and an interesting trade-off.

Resources in Civilization V are far less important than in previous installments. City health had been removed and as a result, all unique food luxuries are largely redundant. Certain city improvements are tied to particular kinds of resources, but the player has very little incentive to acquire a large variety of them. Food resources aren't even available for trade in the diplomacy window, since all they effectively provide is a bonus to the tile they're settled on.

For all the talk about Civilization V's ability to pull in people not interested in 4X games to begin with, it's a shame that the accessibility came at the price of reducing what was once an extraordinary series into a rock bottom of mediocrity. Civilization V's production values are by far its biggest asset. It's ironic then that despite being better animated than ever, the game is infinitely less immersive than it was twenty years ago.

Here are other detrimental sequel changes I couldn't organically fit into the review:
- Commands for units can no longer be queued;
- Missionaries are no longer bound by open border treaties.
- Units cannot be renamed outside of promotions;
- Camera is constantly jerking back and forth between all available units, even if the player wants to focus on just one group at a time;
- Automated workers do not prioritize pillaged improvements;
- Production queues have to be enabled individually for every city by clicking on a checkbox;
- Naval units can now recapture cities;"
11694,Great game but for god's sake don't trust the A.I.
11695,The best Civ game.  Accept no substitutes.
11696,It is a very engaging and addictive game
11697,I've been playing Civilization for 20 years now and this is by far my favorite version they have created.
11698,Very entertaining
11699,"I just like the fact that, the more I play, the more and more subtle complexities I come across. So, if you want a mental challenge, without referring to tutorials, this will keep you entertained for a while. The various civilizations seem well thought through and their specific characteristics bring a whole other dimension to an already quite complex and engaging game."
11700,What's not great about this game and series?
11701,really great game to chill n get high af to
11702,"Pros: It is Civ 5

Cons: Does not have Baba Yetu"
11703,Good game
11704,this game is like crack but cheaper
11705,"Simulation world domination game, how will you take over the world ?"
11706,A good fun game. Dont play if you have things to do.
11707,"I need to play more to give thoughts of any worth. Even though, I recommend to game over some more obscure titles which are very uncertain in regards to quality. Best wishes to all!"
11708,"TL;DR: Even with all the DLC coming out for CIV VI like clockwork, Civilization V remains the best CIV due to its timeless graphics, easy-to-get-in mechanics and completedness in terms of civilizations, replayability and fun-factor. 

In contrast to the comicesque graphics of CIV VI, which were a huge turn-off for me, V pleases with smooth picturesque graphics that are both easy on the eye as well as indefinetly better to distiguish units, terrain and ressources if you're in a hurry (see Multiplayer-games on a timer). Units look real and come in a decent size-per unit, unlike 5-man clown commandos found in the next installment.

For beginners this is quite a good game to get into. It's quick to learn with straightforward mechanics (and not too much of them). The learning curve is quite linear for a long time, easing players into the competetive part of the game(multiplayer, or for difficulties king-upwards). Wonders, building and units and ressource managment are produced/obtained in a straightforward way and in decent quantities (1 iron per iron mine in CIV VI? Have fun running around with one swordsman..). 
The amount of mechanics in the game are sizeable, but not overwhelming: this is what CIV s supposed to be. For Grand Strategy, turn to Paradox games. 

This year, I have clocked in at over 1000h in this game; yet it doesn't stop to be enjoyable, altough i mostly play with the same 6-7 civilizations. The replayability is unlike any I found in other games.
I have yet to have a game where Darius doesn't steal a wonder from me. 

But in all seriousness, f*** him and Attila. Oh and you too, Alex. Especially you."
11709,Best Civ game around as of 2021
11710,"I've played Every version of this game...LOVE IT
"
11711,Nice.
11712,"I laughed, I cried, I committed global homicide."
11713,"Perhaps the best Civ game in the franchise, before they made a cartoonish DLC cash-cow (Civ VI)."
11714,"Addictive, but relaxing. 10 stars."
11715,Great game. Enjoyed it.
11716,good game

11720,n
11721,"A great overview of history from scientific, political, cultural and economic perspectives."
11722,I'd say its pretty good.
11723,"This game is great and insanely addictive. The 'one more turn' syndrome is real, so be careful before you start playing. 

TIP: play this game to assist you in keeping your new years resolutions, as you will even forget to eat!"
11724,"Just an amazing game, been a fan for a very long time"
11725,"Excellent Game, old but sooooo enjoyable, difficulty levels for all"
11726,Still the best strategy game to play..
11727,"Over 1000 hours into this game. Haven't touched it for two or three years, then started playing it again- which naturally resulted in me accidentally spending 14 hours on it in a single day. 10/10, peak Civ."
11728,fun
11729,Recommend
11730,Wonderful game with hours of replayability. You can't go wrong with Civ on a pc.
11731,I have played a lot of Civ 6 and I must agree with the opinions of many I have seen on here.  Civ 5 is better.  It is more fun and the ages seem to really last.
11732,"One of the most interesting strategy games out there. Obviusly the newer one CIV 6 is better, but if your looking for a lest expensive version of the franchise it is certanly the better option."
11733,Help me I've been play for the three days help :(
11734,"Love this game, can be fun for friend groups that can dedicate time to it"
11735,Epic!
11736,shat ap
11737,i think the multiplayer is finally fixed.  Fun game.  Takes over 4 hours for a full quick game online.
11738,Liked everything.. No complaints from me
11739,"Build an empire, rule the world"
11740,"This is an excellent game that I've played many, many times. Years after I uninstalled, I'm reinstalling it to play again."
11741,Played many versions of this game and with ever upgrade it is great...A very complex gaming experience..
11742,good stuff
11743,"Greed is good, have a bonus"
11744,fun
11745,IV is better
11746,"Great game, unbalanced though."
11747,"1449 hours in, launching it now, what does that say?"
11748,This is the greatest version of civ and definitely better than civ 6
11749,This game has helped me to achieve my Doctorate in World Domination.
11750,GG
11751,"Fun, addictive, beautiful strategy game. I keep coming back to this time and time again. There are so many variations to the game that can really change the way you approach your tactics. Every beginning of the game is exciting and unique, and that sense of discovery and danger is certainly there.

I wish the AI was a bit more varied (feels like you keep playing against the same characters), and I wish the end-game moments were a little more exciting. After about 75% of the way through each game, you kinda slow down, but damn, you can't stop. I'm going to try the Brave New World expansion, which apparently helps the end game.

You won't be disappointed!"
11752,Prefer to Civ 6. Probably my favorite of the series.
11753,yes
11754,ok
11755,"[h1]Short review[/h1]

Civilization, which until then was one of the best franchises in the field of management and strategy, has just won its wargame stripes on the occasion of this fifth game. The adoption of a hexagonal grid and the inability to stack military units — a real revolution in the series — literally increases the tactical dimension of combat. The other novelties are less convincing: between a fairly superficial system of social doctrines and city-states which tend to lock diplomatic relations, all is not marvellous. The real question is whether Civilization V is able to attract the veterans of the series. If we can regret the disappearance of certain features, just look back and consider Civilization II, which in my opinion, remains the best episode of the series, to understand that the pleasure of the game is not necessarily proportional to the increasing complexity of the gameplay. From this point of view, Civ V provides the essentials with its intact strategic depth which should convince purists and newcomers.

[h1]Long review[/h1]

Reconcile the expectations of seasoned players, in perpetual demand for complexity, and those of neophytes, which the mere mention of turn-based games may scare: it's a great challenge and it was brilliantly taken up by a certain John Schafer. Chief Designer of Civilization V, this big fan of the franchise spent his time designing maps before being hired by Firaxis Studio and being given the keys to the project. The goal? Refresh the series, allow it to evolve and come back to modernity without losing any of its richness and sharp gameplay. To do this, John imbued the game with his own player view, which allowed him to rethink certain game mechanics without betraying the spirit.

Civilization V offers two game modes: singleplayer and multiplayer, as well as centralized mod management to make it easier to share, integrate, and use community-developed tools and content. I will not cover the multiplayer mode, which is pretty basic and allows you to play with other players - duh. I will therefore only limit myself to deploring the disappearance of the hot seat option which pleasantly complemented, in the previous opus, the online and local network game offer. The singleplayer mode allows you to play on maps defined according to random or carefully configured variables. Size and type of map, number of opponents, starting era, level of difficulty, speed, turn limit, timer, geographical and climatic conditions, resources... Everything — or almost — can be tweaked at will. Fans of historical epics will regret, on the other hand, the absence of a campaign mode but the scenarios are actually quite fun to play and are a correct replacement. Aztecs, French, Iroquois, Japanese, Persians, Romans... the game gives you the choice between 43 civilizations (including DLCs and expansions), each led by a charismatic leader with his own personality and each benefiting from one to two special abilities. Failing to be able to benefit from specific objectives, you will find in this fifth episode the conditions of victory which made the success of the previous ones. They are now four in number: military (being the last civilization to have a capital), scientific (being the first to send a shuttle to Alpha Centauri), diplomatic (obtaining a sufficient number of votes at the United Nations) and cultural (adopt enough social doctrines to build the Utopia project). I will come back to this later.

Until then, it's a long road that begins for the player. He will start the game with a small group of settlers and a scout unit drowned on the world map. This is the opportunity to see the graphic evolution offered by Civilization V. To hope to attract new players, the Firaxis team had to operate a complete cosmetic facelift as the visual rendering has continued to be grossly dusted since the first episodes. The work done at the interface level commands respect. Sober, elegant and efficient, it highlights all the essential information and groups the most detailed data together in various retractable panels. A well-designed notification system can display each alert on demand in order to avoid the multiplication of windows. Discreetly integrated, the game help (tooltips, tutorials, advisors and the essential Civilopedia) can of course be deactivated. The whole is very pleasant to take in hand and suffers only from a few minor flaws such as the need to click twice to access certain panels (those that are disturbed by that will be able to use the keyboard shortcuts) or the impossibility to configure the indications of the mini-map. The extent of visual improvement is also shown on the main map. The cloud cover that acts as fog of war and the ugly early game landscape textures will gradually fade to let you admire the traces of human activity on the surrounding world. The animation of the units is a continuation of the work carried out on Civilization Revolution. Finally, the diplomatic screens display leaders modeled with particular care and a touch of humor. The whole is based on superb dynamic musical themes, adapted to each civilization.

In short, veterans and newcomers alike should appreciate this very successful game, using a slightly revamped gameplay that perpetuates proven mechanics. The game takes place on a turn-based system, with a system of one action per unit and per turn. After exploring the surrounding of your starting location, it is necessary to quickly build and develop your first city (the capital) while starting to explore the rest of the map. Exploration allows you to detect new resources, locate your opponents, but also to be the first to discover the ancient ruins and the Wonders spread over the map (a novelty) to take advantage of the bonuses granted. Besides that, whatever the victory condition is, it is more than ever necessary in Civilization V to carefully manage the economic aspect of the game. The expansion of cities is indeed particularly slow (even if it is still possible to push back their borders for a fee), which forces you to take full advantage of every resources you can find, knowing that citizens can only exploit land previously developed by workers. Technologies open up access to new buildings and units, so they must be planned with the greatest care. To do this, it is possible to consult the tech tree at any time, rich in 74 possible discoveries. Yes, it is much less than in the previous opus, I know. And where are the missing technologies you ask?

In reality, technological discoveries are now limited to technical progress. Economic, political and religious advances are now integrated into a new concept: social policies - and it is probably not bad to have distinguished the two aspects. These social policies are in the form of 10 development trees. Each tree includes several branches to unlock, with a certain number of culture points, with different bonuses available. It is also by unlocking five complete trees that the player can embark on the construction of the Utopia project, which represents the conditions of a cultural victory for this opus. But beware, some antagonistic doctrines cannot be activated at the same time The functioning of social policies is still a little superficial for my taste. They seem above all intended to facilitate such or such condition of victory, without any notable effect your civilization. I particularly regret the disappearance of religious and cultural influence, which is sorely felt. And since we are talking about the cuts, what to think of the impossibility of regulating the tax rate, the overall management of citizens' happiness, the disappearance of spies or even the automatic transformation of land units into ships transport once deployed on the water? Fortunately, the user will notice that these few biases do not in any way testify to an impoverishment of the gameplay, the strategic depth is still intact. And most of them were added back in expansions."
11756,Do it.
11757,yes
11758,Fun game. Haven't played online yet since I'm still trying to understand the game better.
11759,"Tried, tested and true. Will continue to fritter away the remainder of my days on earth playing in Deity mode with random civ choices. I will die frustrated and yet happy."
11760,"love this game.. cant get enough.. quite a few factions, mod compatible and quite a few different ways to play its great"
11761,Endless replayability :  )
11762,Great game to pass the time
11763,Civilization is lastingly satisfying

11773,"Extremely fun game.  Lots of options of how you want to grow your civilization.  I still play it because I like it better than Civ VI.  When you complete a research, you get & keep the benefits.  Same as Culture.  Graphics are top notch, more like CGI than the cartoons of Civ VI."
11774,Eh.  It's ok
11775,excellent strategy game.
11776,the best
11777,Is real good game! Worth the gold!
11778,"it was aight, but it is no age of empires 2"
11779,At least half of my playtime is waiting for everyone to hit next turn
11780,Really easy game to get lost in. Perfect for anyone who likes a turn based strategy game. Tutorial easy to follow but sometimes annoying
11781,The great grand turn based strategy game! Best one of the lot. I have played Civ 6 quite a bit and keep coming back to this one. Excellent game!
11782,Valid game
11783,"Big change compared to CIV IV. A lot of players still think this game is better in everything (better concept, better balanced... etc) then the new CIV VI. One word: Masterpiece."
11784,Good
11785,"Love the layers of this game.  The deeper you go, the more strategy there is."
11786,-
11787,I enjoyed my whole Saturday playing 1 game.
11788,"Loses the stack bonus in 4, but graphics are stunning.  Many hours played in this in multiplayer with my friends
"
11789,Fun to play
11790,amazing wow
11791,It is a Very Fun Game.
11792,"This game is epic, writing this review after 1000+ hours on steam and more before I had it on steam.

If you're in to strategy and turn based play, this is a must have. Civ VI is cool but still has balancing issues, so I still play Civ V more.

if you're new to this type of game, the whole interface is also very user friendly, not so many menus to get through compared to other strategy games, and the icons make it obvious what things do for the most part. There is also a nice selection of difficulties to choose from, from pretty simple to like insane.

Some tips for immortal and deity are:
- Play as Poland
- Focus on getting your population buildings and wonders -before- your libraries, those high city populations will give you the science you need to compete.
- Get your national collage early. even before your second city, you'll lose some land grab time but you'll set yourself up for the rest of the game for science.
- I don't know if this is true, but I'd say the early game god tier wonders you want in your build order are great library, hanging gardens, then national college, the rest of the wonders are good but optional.

If you buy, have fun playing!!"
11793,Great Game
11794,waste many hours with friends never finishing games
11795,"ive put a fair share of hours into this game and i think its time to put my 5cents into the mix 

is it fun yes its a like starting a game of monopoly with your family itll be a fun idea that gets suggested for the first 40 minutes itll be fun then the 2 hours mark will hit then the 3 hours mark and then suddenly everyone is at eachothers throats your friend or someone thinks it would be funny to put a ship near your city or build near you suddenly your send 7 nuclear missiles into there capital its just how it goes it has quite a bit of replay-ability and you can have good fun against friend or ai or random players but by the end of the game youll hate everyone including yourself more than when you started 

worth the price? not exactly i think its worth buying it on a key site for cheaper or wait for a sale"
11796,city states go brrr hahaha
11797,"I've loved this game since it was  a baby with squares instead of hexes.

this edition(with Brave New World) was the thing I was looking for all along. I typically play Pocatello because I like the extra space and the extra control over otherwise random events. this game is still one of my favorites."
11798,"Some people may see this game as somewhat outdated, but I still enjoy it a lot. The diversity of leaders, civs, playstyles, and victory strategies keep you hooked to the game for a very long time. Definitely worth the purchase."
11799,good
11800,fun to roleplay hitler
11801,Best game ever. Get entire expansion sets though or not so fun.

11820,"Absolutely fantastic

11821,UwU
11822,Good strategy turn based game.  Enjoy the old style map over Civ 6.  That one seems to cartoonish.  Civ 5 has more realistic maps and is better running on older machines too.
11823,"Love this game, However. . . after recent updates the functionality of the game has changed.  Examples: recently the barbarians attacked  me with a  galleas in deep water, these can Only go in coastal waters, I captured the ship but was unable to move it;  City states are not consistently sharing resources with me when allied;  frequently when I attempt to move a unit to an adjacent square it moves to a different square 60 degrees off the requested direction, pathing now frequently causes units to go in surprising directions;   the great musician Tchaikovsky's ""1812 Overture"" has been changed to a very poor recording of ""Rule Britannia"", it is hard to imagine this as an honest mistake. 
All that being said I still love this game and the upgraded barbarian hordes are lots of fun."
11824,"Civilization 5 is a great game overall, however to play the game you need to get all the DLC. Brave New World and Gods and Kings both significantly improve the game while keeping it beginner friendly. I play a lot more with my friends and it can lead to some great moments for instance you could think that you are doing a great job in the game only to find out that your friend is two eras ahead of you and has an ideology :). The game is easy to play, but it is difficult to master. You will make mistakes, but remember you can always restart."
11825,I Havnt payed enough to form an opinion yet.
11826,"enjoy this series
nyah~"
11827,one more turn
11828,This game sucks you in for days. It's infinitely playable.

11837,Excellent turn based game. AI is very good and that leads to good games.
11838,"Great Game! I've spent over 600 hours the past few years playing it, and I can tell you it is my favorite one of the series, and one of my favorite overall games. I can get lost in it for hours, and I just control my own government and it's just amazing!"
11839,"Great game and Great value for money, would 100% recommend this game to anyone"
11840,"good game but its comparatively unplayable without all the DLC, for how much content they add."
11841,"This game like all civ games is absolute trash. Without mods the ai is too stupid to find its own cock. with mods the ai just cheats extra hard. there is no redeeming quality to this game or any other civ game. if you want to waste your time just get really high and bash your head against cement for four to eight hours, similar experience and much more enjoyable."
11842,VERY FUN VERY CUTE VERY SEXY
11843,Definitely one of my favorite PC games that I can always come back to. Not much into Civ 6 but highly recommend this game if you at all care for strategy games.
11844,It will eat your life away in a positive way
11845,its fun
11846,A great game!. Civilization is to Risk what Minecraft is to Lego.
11847,As ever. Civ is just the one and only strategy game!
11848,"Fast load time, additive gameplay, relaxing and chilled but also exciting when war breaks out!  Great strategy game."
11849,Gucci no Louis
11850,i would prefer more control on choosing the routes fro my units
11851,So addictive. Just one more turn.....
11852,"Single player rules, but the online multiplayer is hell."
11853,"It's Civ V you know what you're getting into, just set aside enough time to actually finish a game and be prepared to say ""just one more turn"" too many times."
11854,"Excellent in all the right ways. I've found a few leaders I vibe well with, but you can't beat being placed in the middle of nowhere with someone you have no idea how to play. Experiment with different win styles, it's so worth it. Just beware Gandhi when you want to blast everyone else to pieces. 

10/10, still holds up, still so much fun to play"
11855,idk how I got so many hours on this game
11856,I don't like games like this sadly
11857,Yeah its ok if you like strategy games
11858,Best strategy game
11859,Still the most compulsive game in the history of ever. And with so many options to keep things interesting.
11860,yes
11861,"This game has its pro's and its con's 

On the good side its a lot of fun

On the bad side its so fun it ruins my nights sleep, with one more turn x1000

Purchase with caution, and don't play if you have work the next day"
11862,"amazing game dont play it if youre studying or something like that,
 its so good you forget the reality you live in"
11863,Contemporary classic.
11864,"Civ 5:
Annex the world
Buy the world
Negotiate yourself to president of the world
Leave the world
???
Its a good game."
11865,I found it enjoyable to play with friends.
11866,fun game to play with friends
11867,"Before the expansions I was torn since the base game felt quite a bit simplified from Civ 4 (which in turn simplified a lot of what made Civ 3 complex), but I did think from the start that the hex grid was an improvement of the traditional square tiles of the previous entries in the series. With all expansions, this is the best Civ game I've played, hands down. 

100% worth your time as long as you get the expansions. Grand strategy really doesn't get much better."
11868,Been playing Civilization since the original PC game.   Classic game for me.
11869,One of the best strategy games in my opinions with almost infinite mods to vary the experience.
11870,Once you've got Brave New World this game becomes pretty fun. Surprisingly timeless graphics.
11871,"I mean its fun for a few hours, but gets old fast and you won't ever go back to it once new games are out."
11872,Crashes frequently.

11879,It's ok.
11880,"I have liked all the Civilization games. If you want a good strategy game that isn't over too quickly, this is your game. With all the different leaders there are to play, you can replay the game as many times as you like."
11881,i love playing this game. i don't have a pc yet so i'm very limited to what i can play on my mac. and i'm so glad that this game is one of them.
11882,Stunning game at all the various levels!
11883,ok game.
11884,
11885,great graphics and amazing soundtrack
11886,Even without dlc it's well built and entertaining. Many paths to victory and a few leaders to choose from can keep you playing.
11887,Cream of the crop as far as Turn Based Strategy Games are concerned
11888,Fun and addictive turn-based strategy game.  I even like CIv V better than Civ VI
11889,"Don't have a lot of hours, but seems pretty good"

11903,"“I have had this game for 4 days and have played for 30+ hours. The main enjoyment I have playing this game is progressing my character to be more and more powerful while simultaneously being thrust into a world with so much lore and backstory. As with any MMORPG the story is going to be a little dull and routine sometimes, but the overall story and its highlights are amazing thus far into the game. Not to mention you can play as any variety of jobs pertaining to combat and non combat so if you have for whatever reason become bored with class you are playing you can switch at any time. The combat is very fun as well with all sorts of different abilities, classes, dungeons, mobs, and areas. Very good game with a very good community!”"
11904,must....finish.....petra.....
11905,"world

11906,Excellent game. Ive always wanted to know if the 3rd riech could be successful with all that land.
11907,one of the very best games in the series due the mods and different aspects for any gamer that loves either fast or slow paced strategic games this is at the top of the very best.
11908,Best CIV ever
11909,"In my opinion still the best Civilization that isn't too old yet. The DLC make the game insanely complex, interesting and deep. My friends and me have been playing Civ 5 during quarantine a lot and I can also recommend you doing the same if you are as bored as us."
11910,"I grew up playing the original Warcraft on DOS and also Command & Conquer: Red Alert on my PS1, so this type of strategy game is right up my alley. This series is iconic of the genre as a whole for a reason -- they know exactly what aspects players enjoy, they have excellent programmers and artists, and they make it easy to play yet infinitely rewarding and challenging.

If you've never played any of the Civ games before, I think this one is a great way to jump in. The games are all totally independent from each other, but this one has a particularly good tutorial system that helps walk you through the basics. Before long you'll be burning cities down and wrecking the AI.

But the true fun of Civ V, like most strategy games, is multiplayer with friends. This game is SO much fun with friends. Online is great, but at a LAN party this would be freaking awesome. Make secret alliances, betray your friends, etc. Would be a blast.

Anyway, definitely recommended by me. Grab it on sale for sure, though. Few games are worth the original price, but on sale it's a great deal."
11911,E
11912,Great game! It's CIV! What's not to like?!
11913,"I still have no idea how I clocked this much time in the game.

Context: My dad had Civ I and II on his computer when I was in elementary school, and one day when he was at work, I booted up them up and taught myself how to play. Civ II was my favorite game for a very long while, and Alpha Centauri was incredible. Civ III sucked, IV was great, and V might be the pinnacle of the series. (Beyond Earth was ultimately a let down and VI has some interesting changes, but also some terrible design and QoL changes.)

If you want an introduction to the series, this is a great one. If you play only VI and like it, but are getting bored, check out this version. If you still play only II or IV, carry on."
11914,its pretty fun
11915,Why is the additional options button on units half the size of every other button in Direct X10/11 but normal size in Direct X9

11922,"Great Turn based strategy game, I would reccomend this to anyone who loves strategy games, the games can last for days if you really have all the DLC and a bunch of friends. Pick this up on sale with a bunch of the DLC and you will have a great time. I highly reccomened this!"
11923,"I have heard a lot of good things about this franchise. I enjoyed total war in the past, so I thought I would give this a try. The first thing I noticed is the visuals and historical content, both of which are top notch. The music, models, and animations are all beautiful and I could see the gameplay getting very addicting in the best kind of way.

The only gripe I have with this game is a major one. It is too complex and the tutorials don't help at all. When you click on the 'how to play' tab, you are given an encyclopedia to read through. I am a bit slower at learning, and would probably need to play at least 100 hours to understand all of the units and buildings available, and mapping out a strategy to optimize my gameplay would be next to impossible. That's not even to mention I need to understand the politics and what will or won't cause CPU's to denounce you.

Honestly, if you are looking for a game to maybe play a couple times a week, this isn't the game for you. If you have been playing since game 1, you probably aren't reading reviews but that's who the game was made for."
11924,"yes

11925,I liked this product for ... personal reasons that I would rather not delve into right now cause of how things are going at home. No offense.

11928,"Nothing like world domination to unwind at the end of a long day. Building an empire is both soothing and invigorating, depending on how you've decided to conquer the world. The strategies you can use for that are nigh endless. All I can say is just jump in and have at it.

...also, watch out for Gandhi. Do not trust Gandhi. Seriously."
11929,"Good stuff, relaxing - I think this game don't need recommendation. Game is a bit old but still is really fun to play"
11930,game gud
11931,After playing for a little while I've realised this is a pretty good game.
11932,"This game is seriously addictive.  It also lends itself well to different play styles.  You can be more intense and conquer lots of enemy territory, or you can just relax and build museums and stuff."
11933,'ve just played one more game right now. I killed Indonesian guy after he attacked me. All that 7 remaining leaders denounced me and after some turns declared me war. 1 vs 7... I think I can manage it... Shaka is strong!
11934,Nukes.
11935,"Its fun
"
11936,it's ok
11937,it good
11938,This game has fun strategy concepts and the battles are good too.
11939,i just keep coming back to play this
11940,Its alright.
11941,"Good, but does not scale well with a 4k display."
11942,Make love with Joel Evans not war
11943,This game really helps you think with all that is going on
11944,I like it
11945,good game
11946,Great casual game.
11947,"Do you like clicking on things? Do you like waiting 50 turns for a collection of tiny, giant triangles just for Rome to finish them one turn before you do? Do you want to teach Rome a lesson they won't soon forget? This might be the game for you. Not recommended for people who want to have more time in the day."
11948,Amazing game
11949,"Played VI recently and come back to tell you V is the better choice.

VI is too simplified in comparison."
11950,In my opinion this one is the best of the series.
11951,One of the best CIV games i played had so much fun memories and hard making decisions really liked it

11960,Great game
11961,"The only game that no one really finish when you play against your friends.

10/10 would quit again any game before ending them."
11962,you wont stop playing.

11964,ive loved this game for years
11965,"Love it, best strategy game ever"
11966,It fun
11967,yes me like to kill all the nasty chinks
11968,A good way to kill a day or ten
11969,"Classic. No other strategy game compares.
"
11970,Civ 5 is probably my second favorite installment of the Civ series. I would suggest anyone who wanted to get in to competitive Civ 6 play a good portion of 5 to get a grasp on all of the features there in before moving on to the serious advancements of 6.

Excellent game, endless possibilities, fantastic for a weekend with friends"
12006,nice
12007,It does a great job of teaching basic multi-faceted strategy across several different goals.  Mastering this on Deity-level should be a basic requisite of Civics education.
12008,Just one more turn...
12009,Play Civ 5
12010,Very addictive strategy game... Didn't think strategy game could be so addicting......
12011,"One of the best Civ's ever, in my small opinion Civ VI is has a lot live up to.
I'm Still playing both of them, but prefer Civ V."

12014,Yes
12015,"Its a great game, a timeless classic and I think I will play it for a thousand hours more"
12016,Civilization. 'Nuff said.
12017,"This game's freeplay is immersive to the point that you engage much more critically than you would with other games. For a history nerd, it's easily a beautiful way to waste time."
12018,What else to be said!
12019,Fulfill your dreams of nuclear war by nuking the Americans as the koreans.
12020,"Even after long breaks I STILL come back to this game.
Solidly one of the best."
12021,The best CIV of all.
12022,"This is the very first game that I got on steam, and it did not disappoint. The gameplay makes you keep wanting to press next turn, and the graphics are also very nice. Not especially taxing on hardware with standard settings. The one complaint that I have is the AI. It makes very dumb decisions all the time, and at higher difficulties, they are simply given more advantages rather than being improved. Other than that, this game is very nice."
12023,I heard Ghandi is pretty chill
12024,This game never gets old. It's super fun to play either by yourself or with friends. I do wish that they did not remove cross platform though.
12025,Been playing Civ sine 1992.  Another good iteration.
12026,You have to be organized in all phases of the game.  Takes too long waiting for computer turns during mid game (approx. turn 120 to 180)
12027,Best strategy game I've played so far. Always love playing with friends too.
12028,"Honest Review, (From the mind of a simple critic) Industrial Gamers!

Gameplay. Civilization V is a turn-based strategy game, where each player represents the leader of a certain nation or ethnic group (""civilization"") and must guide its growth throughout thousands of years. The game starts with the foundation of a small settlement and ends after achieving one of the victory conditions—or surviving until the number of game turns end, at which point the highest-scoring civilization, based on several factors, such as population, land, technological advancement, and cultural development, is declared the winner. 

Graphics. Honestly still great and I'm writing this in 2021, 11 years later! I honestly prefer it to what we got in Civ 6. 

Sound. The music is some of my all-time favorites to listen to, it doesn't have the best title screen music as Civ 4 (Baba Yetu) but all together it's still a really good soundtrack to listen to whilst plotting mass murder or world peace.

Difficulty. Complex but never enough to demotivate new players. With many ways to win you can find a playstyle that works with you to get an edge on your opponents.

Server. Easy enough to create a game or jump into a random match. (Which I don't advise because you'll get kicked)

Final Rating - Reviewing an 11-year-old game is hard because people already know so much about Civ 5, but if I can add anything to bring in New 4X/Strategy  I would say this. Please start with Civ 5. It's a great game to get into and the replayability is worth every cent. Wait for it to go on sale and you can double your fun with the 'Complete Bundle"" that adds literally hours of new content to the base game!"
12029,"aids l8 game
but still noice"
12030,It's a good game.
12031,gg
12032,"probably the best turn based strategy game ive ever played. shame they never made another one after this
"
12033,"Cross-platform (PC to mac) is unplayable , although i enjoyed this game the specific un-playability with macs ,sucks, as most other games i have that mac also available have the multi-player ability to play across platforms. Until this issue is fixed i probably won't be buying anymore civ games since theres other options/platforms that give better cross platform abilities."
12034,I love this game.  It's a lot of fun.
12035,thousands of hours of replay
12036,Is good
12037,"- Вы хотите в циву?
- Да
- А я с вами ни во что не хочу

12038,CIV V has it merits against CIV VI. Both are very good.
12039,"civ 5 is better civ 6 sucks and is 'too cartoony' have all dlc, good stuff highly recommend"
12040,I liek to build the crowwbow man
12041,"Not a fan of Strategy personally, although even I accidentally spent a few too many hours playing with friends"
12042,click noice
12043,Boring and repetitive
12044,Kewl doggies dude!
12045,"While some changes to the game are less realistic (not needing transport ships, no stacking) other things are better. Graphics is far advanced from the earlier, but I've never been big on glitz."
12046,Pretty good
12047,i like when you
12048,I like this game.
12049,"Yeah, it's pretty good I guess"
12050,"This game crashes too much to be playable.  It also makes playing games with friends impossible due to overwhelming issues created by DLC differences.  As this has been an issue for over many years and across many games, it appears the developers just don't care.  I can't recommend buying this under any condition."
12051,1
12052,Would recommend.
12053,"Fun new mechanics, excellent graphics upgrade, but overall CivIV is still better gameplay."
12054,"This game straight up shits on everything else. What more can I say. I have 2 other steam accounts, one with close to 1,000 hours and the other was an old one when Cub 5 first came out, easily has over 2,000 hours. This game supplies endless fun. Sometimes I will hop on CoD to get hyped up in the action, but after being put on the registry for fucking kids I will return here to relax and build an empire. The multiplayer is fun if you have the right friends to play it with. You’ll never finish a multiplayer game with ransoms."
12055,good pass time killer
12056,The jokes about time disappearing when you play this game aren't jokes... they are serious..

12060,Nice
12061,"Good game lmao

12062,Replayability and depth are a big must for me and this game satisfies

HOW DO I PLAY?

WHY IS THERE A LOADING BAR ???

12064,My top favorit since Civ 1 :-)
12065,"TL;DR: 6/10, 9/10 with mods, 10/10 with mods on sale

Base game is really unbalanced (ex: tradition is the only valid starting culture) and the higher difficulty AI cheats rather than acting more intelligently. Mods like NQMod/LEKMOD VASTLY improve the quality of the game due to buffing the less powerful options, making them actually viable at higher difficulties.

Although I said the higher difficulty AI cheats, it is actually fairly enjoyable to play against. It's sort of like being the nerdy kid in that got bullied in middle school and eventually became a billionaire. The early game is extremely cruel and you'll need to learn how to optimize your play just to survive it. Surviving the early game and playing the same way you did in the early game means you'll most likely come to outpace the AI in tech and army score, eventually stomping them in the late game. Very satisfying, but it gets predictable over time.

Multiplayer is very interesting, since world wonders actually become possible to get and wars become less of a tower defense game and more of an actual strategy game. Sadly, the netcode kind of sucks, crashes are frequent, and each game takes around 8 hours, meaning you'll realistically only be able to play a full online match a couple times per month."
12066,"Poland is a good civ, historically inaccurate"
12067,Nice mix of empire building and war game.
12068,good
12069,So addictive it should be tested.
12070,"I enjoy it, recommend to purchase on sale unless you don't mind. If you want to play with mods, get the all the DLC, not every mod needs it but most mods use some. Plus the DLC is half the game."
12071,"Solid if acquired at minimal to low cost. Otherwise, the newer ones are an improvement."
12072,pretty feckin good man
12073,it's ok

12075,"The perfect game for ""Onemoreturnitis."" Hours, even days, go by in a flash. Not the deepest strategy game, but highly enjoyable."
12076,Probably one of the best games ever made.
12077,I mean it's kind of a classic and better in some ways than its sequel so
12078,Mad in depth.  An All-Time Classic.  Get the dlc's they make the game fun.

The longer you play it, the more fun it gets and the more eager you are to see it through the end, even when it's still turn 100. I am new to Civ and I admit I've been missing out for 10 years not playing this game.

12111,"This game has massive replay value and with the addition of many different mods, even more so."
12112,"Will easily addict anyone, its worth it"
12113,I actually prefer this version over VI. The biggest issue is having workers that disappear after 3-4 tasks is insane!
12114,clang clang boom boom flying noises swoosh VICTORY!
12115,"Great strategy, but feels lacking like most other in the series about tactical elements in the wars. untapped Potential is almost boundless in that area. I must say however this game has taken more hours than I care to admit to."

12117,"Better than Civ VI, in my opinion."
12118,fun stuff
12119,Really Great Game Been Playing For Years!!
12120,"Fun if you have the brain of a rat or something, this game is for little babies who dont even know how to hold a mouse. Go play a real game like Minecraft"
12121,"Simplistic game. Nothing special graphical or in gameplay. Use of DX11 is nothing more than a marketing gimmick. I uninstalled the game already because I don't intend to spend even more time with work-arounds for the bugs. They obviously spend more money on marketing then on game development.
And why can I not change the keyboard controls?"
12122,i left it alone for 5 years then reinstalled and have been playing 15 hours straight so i guess it's kinda good
12123,"after 323 hours, I finally finished one game, would recommend."
12124,any other civ folks out there want to play civ 5
12125,A game that can take as much or as little of your time as you want with the amount of civs you can choose from to custom scenarios and a lot of mods the replayability here is huge.
12126,One of my favorite strategy games of all time and my personal favorite in the civilization series.

12171,"Classic Civ, what else is there to say?"
12172,Best game Ever
12173,"I bought this game having only played Civilization Revolution on the Xbox 360, but as my playtime in this game suggests, I F***ING LOVE THIS GAME.
While Civilization VI has poked its head around the corner ""recently"" and has many quality of life improvements over this game, I will still always return to this game given time. The mechanics for war, city management, and civilian units are so much more simple and nice and don't give me headaches like Civilization VI does sometimes (looking at you unkillable Rock Bands that blast my ears everytime AND WON'T GO AWAY). 

Regardless, this is one of my favorite games of all time. From the immersive leader interaction screens to the mods that let you play as Gabe Newell when you feel a power trip coming on, it will always hold a special place in my heart, and I will miss the days where I meet Attila and hear him scream at me in his beautiful and seductive manner that only he can produce."
12174,fond memories of this game i tell ya

12201,"Great game. Prefer in a lot of ways over civ 6.  If you want constant updates get civ 6, but if you want a well worked game with plenty of extra content i would go for civ 5"
12202,Best one still
12203,i have 2494 hours. trust me its good
12204,I once stayed up for 70 hours straight playing this game
12205,"Civ is a game that takes all night, much like me jacking off."
12206,"Lol xd
"
12207,Much better than Civ 6.
12208,best civ game ever
12209,"epic
"
12210,This game needs mods. Modded its fantastic tho.
12211,For some reason super fuiin
12212,I been playing this a lot.
12213,one more turn
12214,"It is complex enough to not lose interest in playing.
"
12215,eater of hours
12216,"For me Civ V is the best of the series. I tried to play 6 several times but get bored; and I do not the cartoon graphics. Civ 5 is very professional in almost all aspects, with wonderful music and portraits. One can always find things that could be improved but it is too late for that! BTW I recently lost all of my Savegames and History.. very strange! No problems with my latest game but I backup the files manually. .. I do take breaks from playing now and then but I always come back."
12217,cool game
12218,Gas except fuck multiplayer. Connection is trash
12219,"it very pog
"
12220,More fun than the newer version that changed way too much in the game play mechanics. This is the ultimate of the classic Civ versions.
12221,"I love the smoothness and how you can level up the difficulty once you have mastered the basics, It appeals to my inner dictator"
12222,"Played all the of Civilization games, since I was a wee boy. Learn things about the world, my mates did not even know what the wonders of the world was. I think you should buy this for your kids to play with of for nothing else."
12223,Its OK
12224,good
12225,"Very good game, specially when you got stuck coz by Covid19 ,"
12226,"Took a while to get into it, especially because there's not really a campaign, but eventually it hooked me. I was looking for a round based strategy game for so long! I love the fact that you can take your time to think about your strategy, it's like chess"
12227,"Easy to pick up, hard to master. Having all of the expansions is a must, but overall incredibly replayable title"
12228,almost ruined my marriage
12229,"i watched gandi turn bipolar in 45 seconds after getting nukes. i was scared, my dawg was scared, my butthole clenched"
12230,its cool
12231,"I think it is better than Civilization 6. You just need to remember to set up your automatic shut down time for your computer. Otherwise, you won't even notice how late it is ."
12232,"Never really got too interested in this game, but its pretty fun from what ive played. great multiplayer, although the singleplayer mode sort of lacks.

Cool Game!
7.5/10"
12233,"The mechanics are well balanced and if you're more of a take over the entire world sort, with little effort you can indeed rule the entire world on easy.  Also a few rounds on easy will help you to see who to look out for on harder settings"
12234,"Works half the time, at best."
12235,Good game
12236,"Rule the world

12245,cool game
12246,yay
12247,good
12248,next turn
12249,"Combat and sieges are beyond trash with its weird tile system. Still the game is well and definitely takes the trophy for the most addictive game by having you evolve your civilization.

I give it: Every time Gandhi nuked me / 10"
12250,Better then age of empires
12251,Good low intensity addictive game
12252,"Good fun, relaxing and entertaining game with nice visuals. Complex to learn but once you get going it is very intuitive"
12253,I've played this one a bit.
12254,its okay
12255,I will always come back to this game. It is one of my all time favourites and is leaps and bounds better then VI
12256,"hours and hours of fun
"
12257,"cool
"
12258,Only buy this game when its on sale and the price is massively slashed. Not worth it otherwise. Other than that it's a lot of fun to play as many civilisations and I did not realise I sunk 100 hours into the game.
12259,"This game is a true classic and a work of video game art.

Critiques:
Balance issues: food is too good early game, faith is useless late game.
A player joining on a turn timer when it ends breaks the game. This has wasted 40 man hours recently.
Ranged units are too powerful in simultaneous turns.
Killing a ranged unit in simultaneous turns before it attacks is unfair. A ranged unit should deal its attack when killed. 
A queue and a buffer should slow down simultaneous combat
End turn should be a toggle, so that if I'm trying to edit or check stupid things, my friends aren't waiting on me."
12260,good
12261,nice
12262,Awesome Game!
12263,"Great strategy game for all levels of experience in these games. Great on your own, great with friends, nothing else to say."
12264,"It is a fun strategy game, that changes with every turn.  I enjoy it immensely."
12265,pog
12266,Cheaper than six
12267,"i have played almost 500 hours of this game and not won, would recommend
"
12268,Yea
12269,Civ 6 is a great game to play with your friend lots of fun and playable for pretty long.
12270,Pog gmae
12271,"Love this game, play it all the time. Although I tend to fall into similar strategies in every playthrough, the ever-changing maps and the variety of opposing civs makes every playthrough enjoyable."
12272,"If you are looking to get into Civ, there's no better place to start than Civ V. If you're a longtime fan, you probably know that Civ V is the best game of the series. Myriad options and systems work together to create a deep world without being too overwhelming. This is one of the best strategy games ever made, and you owe it to yourself to play it! Also you can conquer the world with pop music and blue jeans so.. yeah."
12273,Just complex enough to have tons of replayability without being too over complicated to understand.
12274,Civilsatun
12275,Was a longtime Age of Empires fan and never got into Civ until recently. Really enjoying the slower pace and extreme detail built into the game. It is a challenge getting into it at first.
12276,good game
12277,10/10
12278,fun
12279,its playable
12280,fun with and without friends
12281, Best Civ of all time. Play it.
12282,"a really fun game with interesting gameplay, an oldie but a goodie"
12283,Just one more turn...
12284,Amazing game with near-infinite replay-ability thanks to the variety of play styles possible.
12285,s'alright
12286,Better than civ 6.
12287,Very fun game.
12288,fun
12289,like all these games it has unlimited replay and is never the same game 2 times
12290,Gandhi has researched Nuclear Fission
12291,good
12292,very fun
12293,"Great game with lots of replay value.  Personally prefer it to Civ 6 (too complicated), but both games are good."
12294,"Any game that feels like 1 hour of gameplay but its actually been 2 days is a good game to me. cant tell you how many times ive started after I got home from work  ""only gonna play for a little bit"" then all the sudden the sun is coming up. Fun game, good time elapser"
12295,Sick game. Prepare to be addicted for a week at a time.
12296,Still better than civ 6
12297,game good
12298,very fun
12299,There are several steep learning curves but that just makes playing the game with other skilled people worth it.
12300,"This games eats time like it's going out of style. I'd try to play for a few hours and then all the sudden a whole day's gone by. Even then, you always gotta fit just one more turn in."
12301,Building a civilization to dominate the world
12302,The first time I played this game I spent all day and night playing non-stop. I've gone on to have over 500+ hours on this game to this day. It's brought me so much fun and enjoyment. I highly recommend it.
12303,I love CIV
12304,"While it can be slow, I play this game with my friends from college while we're all apart. We play straight through and it provides a really fun and addicted strategy based game that doesn't get old."
12305,Amazing Game!!! Still fun in 2021 and is better then both it's sequels!
12306,it is a fun and difficult game at the same time but  i really recommend it you'll play and lose the time so fast
12307,Cum
12308,Fun and super easy to get into for a casual gal gamer.
12309,"Better than Civ 6, damn right. No DLC and it's still better. If you have the money, all you really need to buy to get the full enjoyment out of this game is the Brave New World expansion and Gods & Kings expansion! If you can't afford the expansions the base game is good too, you will still have fun, but the DLC's just add so much more that you can't see yourself going back to the base game unless you have to. Buy the smaller add-ons during a big sale, no real need to have them right away."
12310,I called my Capital Penis LOL
12311,"Say you have a whole day to relax, so you sit down and start a game of civ, guess what. That whole day was just spent on one single game that you haven't even finished yet, but saved and will probably never go back to it."
12312,847.2 hrs...

12318,Seriously addicting
12319,"Allthough only a couple hours on steam Ive played so much of this game, either with friends in a Risk-like casual play or against the pc conquering the world through force of arms or diplomacy. Great game"
12320,pretty good
12321,10/10
12322,how do i stop
12323,Good
12324,"compared to civ I which I played many years ago on a commodore amiga, the gameplay simply isn't as good imho. It's a good way to kill dozens of hours during a coronavirus lockdown though."
12325,1000 hours and still don't get tired of this game
12326,Absaloutly amazing strategy game
12327,"Civilization 5 is a turn based strategy game, where you guide your county through the ages and across the map.  The map is on a hex based grid, and you can move units around, as well as control your cities and interact with other cities and countries.  Several types of victory are possible, so you don't need to conquer everyone to win the game.  You can peacefully win on a technological, cultural or diplomatic path.

Personally, I enjoy the Civ V art style more than the one the adopted for civilization 6.

[b]Pros:[/b]
+Epic time span and tech tree
+Make your own history

[b]Cons:[/b]
-Games take very long to complete, so multiplayer is rarely feasible
-Gameplay is lackluster without the main 2 DLC expansions

[b]Verdict:[/b]
If you are going to buy it, make sure to get the Gods and Kings and the Brave New World expansions."
12328,"If you like Catan or are a fan of strategy boardgames/4K strategy games in general, you're going to love this!

Sid Meijers Civilization V is a masterpiece allowing you to overcome your adversaries through diplomacy, scientific superiority, cultural excellence, religious conversion or sheer domination. It features deep city management and incorporates multiple systems to micromanage to keep your empire sprawling.

GR8 Game, R8 8/8"
12329,Very quality game yes
12330,yes
12331,"It says I have 232 hours but I have played the game longer offline I would say closer to 500 hours. I can heavily recommend this game. This is an all time classic. The base game is way better than any other CIV base games. Having the DLCs turns it into an entirely different game. I play with my friend and we have a different experience every single match. The biggest downside is how dumb AI can be. They love luxuries and will bend over backwards for luxuries so you can abuse them. They do have some smart elements but most of the time they are easy to exploit. When you turn the difficulty up it doesn't make them change any sort of strategy it instead gives them way more starting resources. Another complaint is that you can see how much gold and Gold per turn they have so when I look and see that Alexander the great is making -300 GPT and has 0 gold and he just doesn't lose any units or buildings or anything negative happens to him it's infuriating.

Everything else is an absolute masterpiece. I'd recommend this game over CIV VI (Base game only. CIV VI with it's DLCs has it's upsides)"
12332,It is the best game you will ever play. It helps exercise your mind. And that is what strategy is all about.
12333,Excellent game!
12334,pretty darn good
12335,"Named my Religion AllahuAkbar, and everytime I sent a prophet to convert a city, it would have a huge tag saying ALLAHUAKBAR. Sid Meier's Civilization V 100% satisfaction guaranteed."
12336,"I own this? I played this? when wtf
"
12337,"3896 hrs played at the time of this posting. Try it, it rules."
12338,Civ V is the best of all !
12339,Addictive.
12340,"May cause rifts that alter the flow of time, warping your perception and changing one hour into ten. You can never get that time back, yet despite knowing this, you will continue to rythmically ""One more turn"" repeatedly in your head."
12341,Had a real fun time :)! Buy DLC for the game to be worth it though
12342,good game
12343,Sadly I've never earned a single achievement after Expansionist (yeah i mean IGE).
12344,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rcYhYO02f98 <--- poland guide
12345,"Still one of the best strategy games ever, it's hard to believe that Sid Meier's Civilization V released a full decade ago! The graphics alone hold up remarkably well, and imo look much more appealing than its successor Civ VI. The UI is a masterclass in balancing aesthetics and functionality, and the soundtrack is absolutely incredible. Most importantly, the gameplay manages to be consistently inviting, approachable, and fun without sacrificing depth. Especially on the harder difficulties, reaching a win condition before the AI is a tough challenge - for strategy tips, I recommend FilthyRobot's excellent Civ V series on YouTube. The Civilization series pioneered addictive, one-more turn gameplay, and Civ V remains one of the very best examples of turn-based strategy to this day and one of my very favorite games."
12346,good fun
12347,haha nuke france 🤣🤣🤣🤣!!!1!!1!1!
12348,Great game. Countless hours of fun in single player and multi player.
12349,
12350,Just one more turn
12351,Amazing game. Hours upon hours of fun.
12352,Best game ever :D
12353,"Came back to this after playing Civ VI for a few months. Wow! I forgot how good this was. And, infinitely superior to its sequel."
12354,"be prepared for agame that has too many exploits that will never be fixed, a game where after 120h you might not know what the fuck is going on. but a game thats quite a lot of fun
"
12355,i have stopped the revolution with nukes. also ghandi
12356,Watch out! super addictive!
12357,"A true classic, amazing still even after many years and 1000+ hrs of gameplay. And there are still things to learn and discover to keep the next 1000 hrs interesting."
12358,Still better than Civ 6
12359,"This game is one of my favorite games ever made, by far my favorite 4X strategy, it is addictive, and if you have a few hours to spare, or just wanna pass the time, this is one of the best options. I first played it when it was a free weekend a decade ago, and as soon as it ended I wanted to go back to it. I highly recommend this masterpiece."
12360,"""Hippity Hoppity your religion is my property""

Spain - 1478"
12361,Civ 5 > Civ 6
12362,yes
12363,"This is the kind of game that you have to want to learn to play if you dont want to learn to play it your just not going to have a good time because you wont know whats going on but, it is really easy to pick up. 
After you learn the basics it will become so fun because it offers a lot of awesome interactions with the ai that will never be the same in any of the games you play.
So id give it a solid recommendation its easy to pickup and is just overall really fun to play."
12364,Fun strategy game. Can setup for fast or slow game play. Full control.
12365,3e
12366,"i love this game... been playing this game for 8 years

12367,It's fun with good Mod flexibility. Haven't played multiplayer.
12368,"god tier

12369,"Very interesting game & very enjoyable to play it with friends too! I don't tend to play it very much solo, but it is a great time-killer."
12370,its ok
12371,Great tactical game
12372,"This game helped me through an otherwise boring summer back in college, and has given me a healthy respect for controlled chaos.

Highly recommend playing with all of the DLC, I picked them all up for like $10 in a sale back in 2017 and it really changes the dynamics of the game and expands the cast of characters you can fear as you uncover your world one tile at a time."
12373,"Great game since Gandhi now has nukes and hates everyone, where you are denounced because you didn't give the AI those 4 horses and because you can stop America from ever existing by wiping it out before they can discover Twitter.

9/10 could do with more horses and nukes for everybody"
12374,"Both this game and Civ VI suffer from the same problem: you will need DLC to be able to enjoy them to their fullest. 

In Civ V the base game will be lackluster and will turn into a completely different (for the better) experience with Brave New World. Civ VI also needs the two first DLCs to be worth it - but that game is so much more expensive that you might as well play this one without missing out so much."
12375,"""Just one more turn!""

Sid Meier's Civilization V with all DLCs will always be my favorite Civilization game. With all of my accounts combined, I have over 1,000 hours in the game. This doesn't include the hours in the other titles. Civilization is a famous series, just look up some YouTube videos if you're curious in the game. The game is still great to this day, but sadly there is one flaw. It is highly recommended to purchase the COMPLETE EDITION of the game. Without all of the DLCs, this game can be rather bland in my opinion. Lucky for you, the +$100 complete edition often goes on sale for $12-$50. Wait for a sale to begin an experience that will suck up your precious free time!"
12376,fun
12377,My favorite game. Just calms me down with the nice music. I don't want stress on my gaming.
12378,"CIV 5 is the best strategy game ever created in my opinion. Nearly 700 hours played, it is my most played game. The single player is great for maybe a few hundred hours tops, your first play through will be quite memorable. Still a fairly active community, best played with friends or on a CIV discord."
12379,"bruh what the fuck
"
12380,Fun strategy and nation building game.  The introduction of the one unit per tile rule is a game changer in a good way.  The social policy system is also a cool and interesting addition. 8/10.
12381,mutliplayer crashes and does not work.
12382,"Ijn the top 5 game/franchises ever:
#1 - BG
#2 - AoE
#3 - C&C
#4 - Civ"
12383,:)
12384,Great Strategy Game.  Test that brain of yours.  Kills tons of hours and NEVER the same game twice.  Turn based game that allows playing at a convenient time around every day life.  Best Game Ever!  Until Civ 6 came out.
12385,The best ever!
12386,"Endless hours of fun. Every game is different, every challenge worth fighting for."
12387,ive spent too many hours
12388,cool
12389,"The game in the civ series that got it just right. The new tile system makes the world feel much more continuous and connected than the previous grid. Combat is perfected with each unit type being used in it's own special way, all counterbalancing each other. Great selection of cultures to play as, buildings to build, and ways to progress"
12390,"Best strategy game I have played. Good game mechanics, love the art style, good tech tree, the culture social policy mechanics are great. I love how I every time playing learn some new mechanics and how I can optimise my winning chances with taking specific wonders, religion boosts, social policies and ideology boosts."
12391,yes
12392,"Love all the CIV games, this one my be one of the hardest but still fun."
12393,Better than Civ 6
12394,this game is all fun and dandy until you and your friends enter the atomic era.
12395,VIGGE
12396,"I've played this version for 2,295 hours after updating from Civ 3. This game is very addictive and has unique playablility. After starting a game it's hard not to finish and then start another. Strongly recommend"
12397,"I love playing Civilization V, have played hours at a stretch and never get tired. 
Very highly recommended!"
12398,"Huge Civ fan from day 1. Take it from someone who has over 1,000 hours on this one.... It is one of the best in the franchise...if not THE best. Civ III and Civ V are both a toss up for my #1 favorite Civ version.

Civ V is everything Civ VI wanted to be.... except that Civ V retained some of the best features in the game.

Why Civ V is better than the newer Civ VI:

1: Excellent graphics and sound in both games.

2: The AI for the major civs is probably the best out of all Civ games. Civ VI (newest release) has the ""dumbest"" AI I have seen yet in a Civ game.

3: Excellent spacing between civs. Unlike the newer Civ VI, you actually get some room to explore and expand without having a major civ spawning right ""down the street"" from you.

4: City-States in Civ V are what they are supposed to be. You can make use of them in many ways and they are actually important to manipulate. Unlike Civ VI where they are just there to fill in content space. Why they took away the best part of City-States I don't know.

5: Civ V is THE LAST release so far to allow for automatic workers/builders. The devs mentioned they wanted players to be ""more interactive with the world"" in Civ VI, and took away the automated feature...thus removing your choice to play how you want. In Civ V, if you want to interact more or micro-manage...you can.. if you don't...you can have your workers automated. 

6: In Civ V you can create your own custom Civ. At the time of release, Civ VI did NOT allow for this. You were stuck with the default civs. Civ VI started ""adding more civs"" in the form of paid DLC...Civ 5 had the features when you purchased the game.... Civ VI makes you pay for them.

7: Civ V also included a map editor and ALL the map types (like archipelago, which is one of my favorites). Civ VI at time of release did NOT have this map and did NOT have an editor. You were stuck with 4 or 5 map types which were basically big land masses. Maps for Civ VI were paid DLC packs. Another example of something you get when you buy Civ V,,,, but don't get with Civ VI.

8: In Civ V, you can actually win through diplomacy and go through most the game without firing a shot if you put in some effort. In Civ VI, you are forced into war at every turn. 

Performance:
Civ V runs smooth, cool, and uses very little resources as it is a little older. Civ VI is the has some serious issues on modern cards..especially in the temp ranges on a top tier card. More details for both below.

My system is as follows:

Ryzen 7 2700X - Civ V temps to 53C on large maps. Civ VI temps to 63C on a small map in first 5mins.

RTX 2080ti - Civ V temps to 57C on large maps. Civ VI temps to 82C!! on same small map in first 5mins.
Civ V used a max of 2.2GB of video memory on large map. Civ VI used 3.4GB of video memory on small.

16GB DDR4 3200 RAM - Civ V used about 2GB of RAM max. Civ VI use about 3.5GB RAM max.

B450M Plus TUF Gaming Motherboard

All in all, Civ V is well optimized for my system. Civ VI really put a lot of stress on the graphics card...Temps were the highest of any game I have ever ran. Civ VI also pegged the GPU load to 100% even in the menu screen. There are some serious optimization issues compared to Civ V. The graphics were NOT that big of a difference to me to justify the huge spikes.

BOTTOM LINE - You get more with Civ V, more content, more options, better AI, and smoother running on big scenarios. Sure, there is DLC for Civ V....but those are add-ons... unlike Civ VI where you have to pay for what you get for free with Civ V.

12402,"Awesome ideas, awesome execution - except for the 8+ player multiplayer, tf is up with the gameplay-breaking connectivity issues? Regardless, would definitely recommend to a friend."
12403,It's okay I guess
12404,Not as addictive as other older Civilization games.
12405,"Clear interface, cruelly addictive gameplay, detailed graphics. Civilization V has tentacles that won't let you go. If you don't want to lose most of your productive time in the coming weeks, you better stay away from five!

It is the year 4000 BC, you start with a settler, your task is to establish a city and build a civilization from it that will rule the world.

The game brings interesting changes compared to previous Civilizations, for example, you can no longer have a larger number of units on one square. Now 1 field = 1 unit applies (with the honorary exception of special characters such as generals). This in itself changes the game significantly and makes the war in Civilization V difficult chess.
Each unit has its characteristic pros and cons. The ride can handle archers without any problems, but as soon as the spearmen appear, the horses have a problem. And what about this: archers, siege engines, catapults, at a later stage rocket launchers, simply units with ranged weapons can now fire again through several fields! At five, then, sacramentally, it depends on how you maneuver your army in difficult terrain. Of course, mountains, hills, forests, jungles and other pranks of nature also play a role.
In addition, cities have newly acquired active defensive abilities, where they can fire up to a distance of two squares on attacking units, and thus actively participate in the defense of your empire.
The concept of ""happiness"" is defined in the five at the level of the whole civilization. The happier your empire is, the sooner the golden age will come and you will be able to enjoy faster growth. But if civilization is unfortunate, cities are growing more slowly, they are producing more slowly, there is simply a recession. You can influence your luck with buildings such as the Colosseum, the stadium, simply bread and games for plebs.

Statistically, five is less richer than the previous part, but statistics are not everything. If you look left and right, you will find that strategy games are dying out for us. Their numbers are no longer what they used to be. Simplification is the way to survive, while simplification in CiV is done with maximum feeling for the final playability. [b] 95% [/b]"

12412,This shit is addicting

"
12414,Enduring gameplay. Lovely soundtrack
12415,its good
12416,this has been a favorite game of mine for years. i just wish the multiplayer option was more functional
12417,"This game is good for people who sometimes want to kill some world leaders and their civilization.
"
12418,Just a Legend
12419,Wasted years worth of my time on this game. 10/10 would recommend
12420,"Love reading through people's experiences with this game so I thought I'd share mine.

1st Playthrough: 

-I chose to play as Egypt on a decently large continents map. 
-Founded Thebes in the middle of the continent. 
-After progressing through the early technologies, I explore north and discover Russia.
-Russia was thankfully peaceful and we traded marble, stone, and horses for a bit. 
-Egypt has access to a specialized Chariot Archer which doesn't require horses to produce so the handful of barbarian camps were easy pickings. 
-A little southeast of my third city is Almaty, which has among the only iron deposits on the entire continent. 
-After producing my first set of catapults, it was time for war against Almaty. 
-They offer little resistance and succumb to my invasion.
-Russia, meanwhile is not happy with Almaty's fate as she apparently was trying to befriend the city-state.
-Another war ensues. 
-Russia has a whopping O N E city to their name as well as a handful of spearmen.
-She loses incredibly quickly to my ranged units and horsemen take her capitol.
-A few hundred years pass by with nothing of note except for founding a couple more cities around the continent and some diplomacy with the other two city-states on my continent. 
-I eventually gain the ability to sail across deep ocean tiles and migrate west in search of new territory. 
-My scouts find another large continent and I send settlers to found a coastal city in the ""New World.""
-Speaking of the New World, my scouts also discovered Siam and the United States. 
-Siam was friendly, but the US was a bit guarded for some reason. 
-After founding a new city on the second continent, I negotiate an open borders treaty with Siam to scout around their territory. 
-When I reach the western edge of the continent, I discover what little remains of Arabia, who had been warring with the US for a while. 
-Washington had taken most of the Arabian cities and Arabia was practically bankrupt.
-After Arabia lost its capitol, Siam approached me asking if I wanted to assist in a war against America.
-Washington had recently denounced Siam and Siam and I were allies, so I agreed.
-America, despite its strength against Arabia, crumbed quickly to the combined Egyptian and Siamese military.
-After the war, peace ensued for many years as Siam and I developed Medieval technologies.
-Out of nowhere Siam declares war.
-The war started in the mid-Medieval period and lasted until the mid-Renaissance, displaying an evolution of armed forces.
-Siam all of the cities it took from the United States and a couple of its own after hundreds of years of combat. 
-My frigates also decimated Siam's minuscule fleet which had attempted to blockade one of my coastal cities.
-Siam eventually offered peace which I accepted. 
-I dispatched scouts and caravels to scour around the world in search of additional land, resources, and other empires to trade with since Siam was a poor loser. 
-Found a few city-states on tiny islands and a German scout.
-A while later, my caravel found Polynesia and China. 
-Germany denounced China and the two bicker for a while but nothing comes of it.
-I establish trade with Polynesia and Germany which China is not happy about.
-It's time to industrialize! 
-I improve my military with industrial-era units and discover flight before anyone else.
-Siam meanwhile is trying to compete in this little arms race while also befriending city-states.
-Germany denounces China again, which still lead nowhere.
-I discover the last nation, that being the Ottomans. 
-Establish trade with the Ottomans which were just denounced by Siam.
-Siam and the Ottomans could not be farther apart geographically. 
-Find the Ottoman Empire on a small landmass north of my main continent. 
-The Ottomans denounce Polynesia which leads to war between the two.
-While those two duke it out, Siam wants a part of the joy of war and declares one on me.
Cool.
-Siam vs Egypt round 2 begins and my air force proves to be more than a match for their navy hanging out around one of my cities.
-After dealing with the blockade, I advance my army into Siamese territory and lay siege to multiple cities. 
-Manhattan project. 
-You know where this is going.
-After a back-and-fourth battle around the Siamese capitol, I retreat my forces. 
-I load an atomic bomb onto an aircraft carrier and send it north of Siam. 
-Air raid sirens blast as the first developed atomic bomb is dropped on Siam.
-The Siamese military, the brunt of it stationed around the capitol to repel my invasion is eradicated.
-The world goes quiet.
-Siam's capitol fell days later.
-While irradiated, I now owned one of the largest cities on earth.
-After a small conflict around one of their remaining cities, Siam negotiated peace a few days later. 
-Life returns to normal for many years as I refine my empire and grow my army, ensuring I had a healthy supply of nuclear weapons as a back-up plan if peace became impossible.
-Meanwhile, in foreign news, the Ottomans finally made peace with Polynesia after Polynesians captured one of the two Ottoman cities. 
-China made an alliance with Polynesia and declared war on Germany. 
-Having a pact of defense with Germany, I was dragged into the war.
-Germany fought China while I fought the Polynesians whose navy advanced quicker than I expected. 
-It was a costly fight, but eventually the Polynesian fleet retreated allowing my forces to advance to their mainland.
-My submarines dealt with Chinese submarines nearing my cities. 
-Germany's turn: Air raid sirens blare. 
-Germany nukes China.
-I finally advance my armies into Polynesian territory and take its capitol within a hundred years. 
-With Polynesia conquered and its empire in shambles, China negotiates peace with Germany and I shortly after.
-I notice Ottoman settlers trying to settle near me.
-I ask the Ottomans to back off and they reluctantly comply, choosing to settle near Germany. 
-Germany gets mad and denounces the Ottomans. Thankfully war is somehow avoided.
-China denounces me and I denounce them likewise.
-I spot a Chinese nuclear submarine close to my territory and promptly declare war to deal with it. 
-After sinking it, I ask Germany if it wants to war with China again. Germany declines, seemingly focused on dealing with the Ottomans.
-The war with China is uneventful, mostly just a game of chicken with our fleets exchanging blows here and there.
-We eventually make peace.
-Not much happens after that except for occasional trade between Germany and I...
-Until Siam.
-I had foolishly allowed Siam to survive with three cities after the second war. Now, many years later, it had recovered somewhat. Enough to reform a decently sized military and one singular nuclear missile.
-Air raid sirens ensue as I watch in horror as a nuclear missile detonates in the first coastal city I founded in the New World. 
-While my military was spread around, the city was now rich in resources which the nuke demolished. 
-After the clicking of my Geiger counter stopped ringing in my ears, the world watched to see how badly Siam would fare in this final showdown.
-I spared no expense (except additional nukes) to crush Siam. 
-My late-game army steamrolled through Siam's tanks and infantry.
-My helicopters, mechanized infantry, and death robots captured the remainder of Siam's once-great empire. 
-Finally, Siam was no more.
-While I had achieved total victory over my century-long adversary, it didn't come without a price.
-Siam's nuke as well as capturing cities severely damaged my empire's happiness which caused several small insurrections to amass around Egypt.
-After dealing with the rebels, I spent some time building happiness increasing structures in my cities to fix our quite literal crippling depression.
-Take a break from Civ 5 and start several other playthroughs. Those I actually finish.
-Ending is to be announced. Game's a solid 20/10"
12421,"It's definitely a long game, but super fun!"
12422,"lower the price, fix the servers, let us mod already not all of us like civ 6 and rather you keep this game playable and treat your customers properly!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
12423,"Very buggy units would not move where i clicked which is a shame as i used to enjoy civ
"
12424,"Good game, as it should be seeing as I have wasted my life for 59 hours playing Civ 5. So if it was bad I should seriously have made a better management decision. But it is good, can play the ABSOLUTE HUNK Montezuma. Very good 100/10 gaming, much strategy, to bad I am the dumb monkey brain."
12425,"As a person that largely despises strategy games, Civ V is one of them that I can actually get into and play and wrap my tiny brain around."
12426,Still way better that civ 6
12427,play it
12428,"this game no longer runs on my insantly awesome computer, dont know why... crashes after opening scene everytime, trouble shot it and no luck.animations are cool but time consuming. later you get in the game, the slower the game will run. fun game, if you have a lot of time on your hands. multiplayer is fun but a lot of peoples computers cant handle the communication between devices because its a lot of information to transfer so i suggest land line multiplayer. aaaand dont save your games and come back. it takes up a lot of space on the memory on your computer that you wont even fully enjoy coming back to play, so just dont do that."
12429,great game
12430,Not bad
12431,Great game! Hours of gameplay just in one scenario. Loved it.
12432,"Great game, easy to sink many, many hours into"
12433,"Better than CIV 6. 

Simple reason: The CIV 6 AI is still (2021) terrible but in CIV 5 the AI for the most part knows how to play."
12434,"One of the best games ever made. Must have all expansions though, each one dramatically alters the gameplay from bottom to top."
12435,"Civ V has an error I have seen reported before, yet continues to be uncorrected. At a certain random point in the game, it will simply shut down. Even if you save up to that point and replay, you cannot get past the error point. It may be there are too many cities or units. Does anyone know how to fix this."
12436,This game is probably one of the best 4X games ever created. Hundreds of hours in it remains entertaining.
12437,"Probably the best PC game ever

"
12438,Оамм... Эстетично то как. Заставляет задуматься.
12439,great game
12440,Still a very good and versatile game
12441,"I really like this game. I highly recommend getting the dlcs for this game since they make the game so much more enjoyable with the amount of diffrent civs and diffrent strategies. The only unfortunate thing with this game is that the social policies are very uneven and you can rarely go for other starting policies than Tradition or Liberty.
I am quite sure there are som mods to fix this problem doh.
I would definetly reccomend this game.

4/5"
12442,societal means
12443,"It's basically fun and well made. A little on the serious side, but ok. Runs fairly well out-of-the-box with Linux Ubuntu, even though the screen driver can be a bit tickly."
12444,"Well, I started at about 8pm. It is now 8am.... One. More. Turn."
12445,I love this game. It is one of my favourite strategy games and definitely my favourite turn based strategy game. I love the complexity of the world and the amount of paths you can take to achieve victory.
12446,I had a good time playing it !
12447,This is my favourite game of all time
12448,BEST GAME EVER.
12449,"After investigating ancient ruins, your Pikemen are promoted to Riflemen... 10 Ancient Gunpowders / 10!"
12450,I didn't realize I had this many hours put into this game. An excellent game by any standard. Truly one of the best games out there.
12451,"very swag, especially with friends"
12452,gud gaem
12453,ITS GOOD
12454,nrut txen
12455,"Fun, strategic game that has tons of replay value."
12456,Simply addicting. Played almost 6000 hours.
12457,Good time spent playing this game
12458,"While not my favorite Civ game to play alone, for some reason is an absolute blast with people! And there are almost always some matches here and there online just waiting for people to join. It's a well-done game that implemented the hexagons into the Civilization games and almost always has balanced games with a a well-done timer and very well done interface. It's also the best-looking Civ game in existence as far as graphics go. It's well-worth the investment into this one. It's a game for the ages."
12459,very fun.
12460,I have had a lot of fun playing this game
12461,.
12462,This game is good.
12463,gang society
12464,I am the king now
12465,One more turn
12466,Pretty fun game if you like playing as a country and beating up other countries
12467,One of the best games ever made. Tons of modded content available. The (free) available SDK allows you to create custom worlds or scenarios. Great game. What really puts it over the top is that it's not Civ VI.
12468,"Really fun with friends, like a shorter stellaris."
12469,Multiplayer and strategic.  A must play for individuals who like controlling vast armies to defeat their opponents.
12470,잠깐만 하고싶은데 잘 안되네...
12471,"Is nice
"
12472,"Civ 5 lacks Leonard Nimoy like a Vulcan not knowing how to ""Nerve Pinch"". Oh that generic soundtrack is grating on the ears - considering that Civ IV treated us to masterpieces from the likes of Beethoven, Dvorak and Brahms.

But Civ 5 improves almost every facet of the series without over-complicating mechanics or over-simplified gameplay. A masterpiece of One-More-Turn philosophy. Just find something else to listen to whilst playing."
12473,"These sort of games are just way too addictive...""one more hour"" can easily turn into about 4.
"
12474,Played it a bit... It seemed fun
12475,An old favourite
12476,Good old Civ
12477,ok
12478,"This is one of the only games I keep coming back to and dump 5 or more hours into the game per round. There are so many ways to play though the game and with workshop content makes it infinitely more enjoyable.
I also think this game is better than Civ 6 any day."
12479,"It’s not over! Everybody betray me! I fed up with this world! You little tramp. How could you do this to me?! I gave you seven hundred years of my life! And you betray me. I treat you like a princess, and you stab me in the back. I love you, and I did anything for you to just please you, and now you betray me! How could you love Gandhi?! Everybody betray me. I don’t have a friend in the world."
12480,"If you're looking for a phenomenal turn based strategy game, I would highly recommend this game. I am aware civ VI is out, seriously, do not buy civ VI, civ V is waaaaaaay better."
12481,"pog
"
12482,"its so good, i now have a legal copy"
12483,"very fun, much kill."
12484,making maps on the SDK is a lot of fun that's where all my hours came from. I've never actually completed a game of CIV V
12485,"I can't add too much compared to what has been said before but... 

This game is spectacular. One of my favourite strategy games out there and there is a lot of enjoyment to get from it. From just trying playing casually, to suffering on Diety or just messing around with mods (one of my favourite past times). If you are interested in trying out Civ or a strategy game in general, I would recommend picking this up. And though Civ6 already exists, this game still stands up greatly compared to it."
12486,i will be quick i have 200+ hours on this game with the disc version and trust me this is the best army startegy game out there it's fun with ai and a blast with friends this is also the best civ game in the franchise don't get 6
12487,very good game :) give it a try
12488,"One of the greatest strategy games of all time, literally timeless."
12489,yes
12490,The perfection of the classic Civ-Gameplay.
12491,Best game I have ever played!
12492,"The better you are at Civ, the worse you are at life."
12493,Turn based world building at its best.
12494,Amazing
12495,i suck but when i play against the easy bots on a team with friends i win so i like it.
12496,I had no idea how therapeutic micromanaging an empire was. Learn something new every day.
12497,sss
12498,"Best game in my game library. But don't take my word for it, waste all of this afternoon on this wonderful game."
12499,Got to have something to do so why not PLAY!
12500,pretty great game that you can always come back to and kill time with
12501,Fun and entertaining. Has some good historical units.
12502,I absolutely love this game!  In my opinion it is way better than Civ VI.
12503,fuk u cid mayor
12504,"Never thought I will get addicted with this game but this is so freaking awesome!
The greed in me is so alive! *bwahahaha*"
12505,"hex grid big improvement. they kinda messed up wars by not letting you stack units but that fixed the MAJOR problem with civ 4 hyper stacks so i mean take what you can get. 

still a strong multiplayer community"
12506,hype
12507,Just...one...more...turn!
12508,Pretty Good Game.
12509,"great game to play with friends who are willing to spend 3-5 hours
game matches are long fun very very fun
fun civ game
lots of choices and customizations"
12510,"great social experimentation gameplay
"
12511,"not very deep. its pretty easy to jump into, but if youve played one game youve essentially played them all. the experience game to game has little variety. other strategy games have more to offer. wouldn't really recommend imo"
12512,Pog game
12513,"I love this game, the base game is great and can spend many hours playing it. I just got the DLC and they make it EVEN better. from a 10/10 to 11/10. Worth the cost!"
12514,Damn Good game.
12515,fucking ivan betrated me you pice of shit
12516,Great Civilization game.  My favorite iteration.  Much preferred to Civilization VI which is not nearly as enjoyable.
12517,Great mix of good design with intuitive but complex mechanics.
12518,A real gem!
12519,"Good game when you're alone. Good game when you're with friends. Many fond memories. Fun Mods and challenging Scenarios. The empire-building and strategizing are simply amazing. 

The only really negative thing is the stupid AI."
12520,is fun classic!! 10/10
12521,good
12522,insanely addicting
12523,I NEED HELP PPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPP
12524,My all time favorite game
12525,"Think of the game Settlers of Catan, but double the complexity and triple the amount of time - you've now completed your first turn. Good luck finishing."
12526,"Great if you like winning your board games by marrying into every nation in order to give your friends anxiety. 
8.8/10 I would go get my 2h long afternoon snack in the middle of a game again.
Trebuchets ftw"
12527,better than civ 6 tbh fram
12528,"With all of the DLC, this is by far one of the best turn based strategy games ever made."
12529,"Fantastic game, very addicting! This is my first Civ game but I'm really enjoying it so far, even if the desire to do ""just one more turn"" causes me to stay up way later than I should! 

What really impresses me about the game is its depth and replayability. You have a choice between so many different leaders to play as, difficulty levels, game lengths, map types and sizes, number of opponents, and paths to victory that it allows you to have new experiences even after a substantial amount of time. Not only are the strengths and weaknesses for each civilization unique, there's no telling which historic leaders you'll be competing against and they will not react to your actions in the same way.  And on top of that, there's historic scenarios to play through, which I haven't even tried yet! Normally it's rare for a game to keep my interest for very long, but with this one I know I'll be able to exceed 100 hours with ease and still have so much more I want to try."
12530,y
12531,"lit
"
12532,"just....one...more,,,turn..."
12533,GREAT GAME TO RUIN YOUR FRIENDSHIPS WITH
12534,Still the best Civ game imo
12535,Best game ever
12536,Still after 10 years of playing this game. I find it interesting enough to start new game sessions.
12537,"this game is sex
the dlc is also sex

 8/10"
12538,its civ5 what is there more to say
12539,Why do I have to say anything if Ive played a ton of hours in it of course I like the game
12540,"The game I have more hours on, and now with the Vox Populi mod, ill sink in even more hours

This and Endless Legend are my fav games on Steam"
12541,"This game is awesome. 
Graphics are fantastic, especially for when it came out. I personally like the realistic look waaay more than Civ 6's cartoony vibe. I couldn't stand the way that Civ VI looks at all which led to me returning. 
Narrator is god tier (sorry Sean Bean, there's no contest)
Mechanics are fun and rewarding.
Spent more hours in this than any other game I have and I don't even like empire management games most of the time. 
A++"
12542,"India is a nuclear power in real life, this scares the average Civ Player"
12543,"I am not very warlike, I prefer building an empire, which I can do. In the early stages of the game it is more interesting. In the later stages one needs a good war to keep it interesting."
12544,Good
12545,"The best Civilization game. Great mechanics that are relatively balanced, a beautiful and consistent art style, and the gentle learning curve means it is great for new strategy game players. With the expansions, the game has multiple fleshed-out winning strategies that allow you to shape your civilization the way you see fit.

The negatives are mostly those that nearly all games of this type (""4X games"") have to deal with: the late game is lacking the magic of the early-game exploration (which is excellent - scouting the map for ruins, other civilizations and potential sites for new cities is always the best part), and the AI is not as good as it should be. The latter is mostly an issue at higher difficulty levels, where playing against the AI means playing with a severe handicap instead of playing against worthy opponents."
12546,It is a fun game once you get the hang of it.
12547,"The Civilization games are still my favorite overall, and this one is great in so many ways, but also falls short in too many ways, unfortunately. The biggest shortcoming being the AI of the computer players, especially in combat. The mods help some, but it's still lacking. And Civ 6 is actually worse than Civ 5, so I guess this game has that going for it. I get burned out on it fairly quickly anymore, but it's still a really good game that I find myself going back to from time to time, which is saying something given that it's so old now."
12548,Straight up solid 4X strategy game.
12549,Love Civ!
12550,Good game
12551,Fun game to play with friends
12552,good
12553,It's ok ig
12554,Is good
12555,Easily one of the best games ever made.
12556,itsa vera niceah
12557,best game
12558,gud
12559,my friend likes to nuke me
12560,EDUCATIONAL AND INFORMATIVE OF THE PAST...CIVILIZATION
12561,twe
12562,Nothing makes me want to smash my friend's face in with a hammer than when they kick off a game by stealing my ONLY worker...
12563,I lost 3k hours to this game...
12564,^
12565,Great game really keeps you intrested! I find myself lost for hours doing this or that on the game it's been a lot of fun
12566,"Had fun playing this title, always enjoy a good civ romp, this just being a more polished further advanced version of it."
12567,Very cerebral . . great for game players who like to build worlds . .
12568,"Great game, low pace and possibilities for tens of hours per game. Some bugs like workers that don't work or online games that get stuck. 8/10"
12569,People are mean to me on this game but i still like it.
12570,"Good Game, play with friend"
12571,Enjoying turn based games and having a conquest mindset is a must
12572,"Addicting, had to put it to hide mode because I could not stop playing :v."
12573,"pretty good, not eu4 but i dont get as mad."
12574,It's good.
12575,good
12576,"it is the best civ game that you can have at the moment hands down. but six is pretty good too.
"
12577,"Not bad, but after playing vanilla for awhile, you'll need some mods to help spice it up and get some more longevity."
12578,"I've played Civ 3, Civ 5 and Civ 6, and Civ 5 is the more enjoyable out of all of them."
12579,very epic
12580,Quality. :)
12581,I liked the team play and joint research for this version of Civilization
12582,One of the best PC game ever! Also macOS support is very useful.
12583,The best game in the series for me
12584,"I rarely leave reviews so here it goes. I loved CIV 3, and thought CIV 4 was Terrible. With that said I really really enjoy CIV 5, I feel like they took the elements that made CIV 4 new and interesting, and fixed the combat mechanics, added in cool new features, units, and the many many Civilization choices are super cool. Now, why do I not recomend you buy this? It crashes on my Desktop all the time, I have pinned it down to the CIvilization Leaders Diplomatic Cutscenes, something about it crashes Direct X and the Graphics engine that reverts your higher PC down, to let it run this old game. Its sad, but I have to save the game every 4 turns or so because it will crash most of the time with other Civilizations talking to me, and with the CELTS it crashes the game each time they try to talk to me. So just buyer beware. Maybe if your PC is lower end, and not 4K graphics beast on windows 10 like mine, then you might not have this issue?

EDIT, I have re-installed this game on some older Laptops and it is playable now, so I will suggest that if you have multiple machines at different specs, and the game gets  a bit cheaper $25 , or so then risk buying it.

You can also always go back and try CIV 3 complete, for $1 ."
12585,good game
12586,Is it 4am already?!
12587,Old and gold
12588,Yes.
12589,more replay value than a barrel full of monkeys
12590,Yeh good
12591,Yes
12592,Very fun game. no problems... have spend many nights and days on it
12593,"bruh im on and off this game. sometime i think eh, i kinda want to play civ 5 and finally when i get down to it and start the ball rolling; 8 hours go by and im like oh shit, what time is it? oh yeah, time for more civ."
12594,yeah its alright i guess
12595,Great strategy game that's not too complicated. Easy to get into a game and fun until the end.
12596,gg
12597,"Very realistic as I kept getting nuked. Thank you Sid Meier,"
12598,MAGA
12599,"It's fun but it is easy to get burnt out after a while, but that's where mods come in handy I guess."
12600,"My favorite in the series.  It gave us hex grid!  No more unit stacking means battles are actually interesting.  So, so many civs to choose from.  A masterpiece"
12601,"its good
"
12602,"Sometimes I'm afraid to boot it up because before I know it I'll have spent 7 hours sitting in place, not eating, drinking or taking a piss while telling myself I'll just have ""one more turn"""
12603,its fun
12604,Its ok
12605,"Probably the best game ever in the entire Civilization series.  Having played all six, Civilization V is the easiest to navigate and understand.  It takes elements from all the previous Civilization games and combines them to make a truly wonderful experience.  

There has been much discussion that Civilization IV is at the same level or better, and this is really up to anyone to decide.  Civ IV did have some very good attributes but I *don't* miss corporations and think that the concept of preventing unit stacking made the game much more realistic since now a player has to determine combat width instead of having, for instance, twelve tanks stacked in a single square.

The one serious complaint about Civ V is to so called ""nuclear bomb bug"".  The game has a very annoying habit of exploding a nuclear weapon, with full graphics, then all other nuclear weapons launched (without saving and restarting the game) have no graphics at all.  This has been a known bug since at least 2007 and has never been fixed.  It also happens randomly without any real pattern, but appears to be in the game code since people with the most advanced graphics cards have reported this problem as well.  A shame, don't except any Terminator 3 scenes were multiple mushroom clouds explode across the world, since the graphics go away after the first hit."
12606,S tier game
12607,Its like bird eye view bean battles
12608,Great game. Better than civ 6.

12627,"Stuck on this like civ 3 for no obvious reason. Ai could be better and had to purchase dlc for spies and religion, they arent in base game but otherwise a great civ game imo"
12628,very epic game (better than civ vi lol)
12629,"Takes a while to understand wtf is going on but when you do, time to pillage."
12630,time works differently when you are playing this game
12631,after 416 Hours I still find it entertaining.
12632,"I loved CIV IV back in the day. Started playing again recently with VI and enjoyed most of the differences, but i find V is a nice blend between the two. This is my favourite CIV game so far."
12633,Addictive and strategic; good for solo or multiplay.

12635,"I love this game.  It's not perfect, but it's far better than any other civilization/war simulator on the market."
12636,playing this instead of working on the stimulus package lol
12637,Everything about this game is great apart from the AI. If you want a fun strategy game to get yourself into the genre I highly recommend this title!
12638,Amazing
12639,"It is varied in its victory paths. I very much like the scenarios such as The American Civil War.  All of the games have been challenging with out being unwinnable. Only your skill decides if you will succeed.

12651,this game gives me a false sense of control over my life
12652,This game is *literally* the reason that I dropped out of college in 2013. No regerts. 10/10.
12653,Been playing since Civ 3. One of those rare games that gets better with each edition!
12654,"An addicting country simulator that captures the excitement inherent to growth, expansion and role-play, enhanced by a beautiful presentation that hasn't aged a day (and is way better than fucking Civ 6's)!!!!

It has a couple of features I don't like, happiness is stupid and obtuse and is in no way connected to how society actually works in real life, the World Congress is really annoying late game, the vanilla UI kinda sucks and is unhelpful, and Science specing and tradition / rationalism are way too overpowered to where no other strategies are viable and games get kind of homogeneous. But man, this is seriously some of the most addicting shit ever, and nothing beats the feeling of looking at your level 45 capital in a beautiful grassland valley, with the dozens of wonders you've whored throughout the game strewn about. You really feel like you've earned something for your work.

I just wish the multiplayer wasn't the most inconsistent and jank thing ever."
12655,"I had to delete this game to stop playing.
This game is so god damn good.
"
12656,This is a fantastic game and it's even beter with mods and dlc. I definetly recommend this to people who don't have this game.
12657,Far more enjoyable that Civilization 6.
12658,"This is a review of how the game is right now, with both expansion packs. Money is a big issue in the game currently, so I recommend the ""hot seat"" function even when playing alone. The developers changed the ""happiness"" feature back to -1 happiness per 1 population, so play safe. Diplomacy seems fine for now, but I did experience the AI civilizations declaring war on me when they were on ""very friendly"" about a year ago. 

I am not sure whether you can turn off expansion packs in civ 5 yet, but you definately can in civ 6."
12659,"Sid Meier's Civilization is a GREAT game. I can play it for days, not just hours. Civ V is still a pleasurable adventure and a fun pastime. As always, it's almost impossible to resist that just one more turn! Enjoy, it's worth it."
12660,"*8 DAYS* of gameplay later, I can assure you this game is worth your time and money."
12661,Great game better than Civ 6 IMO
12662,i have been playing civilization since windows 98 days. this version is the best!
12663,"Excellent plot and interesting development of nations and competition.

Rewarding experience."
12664,good
12665,The best Civ game. Would recommend to anyone. Difficulty is well scaled
12666,Pretty fun  with friends
12667,i am not good at this game - but its aight
12668,The best Civ to date including 6.
12669,"It was tempting to mark not recommend, because it's seriously ADDICTING and will cause sleep deprivation!
I couldn't do it.
This is a fantastic version of the Civ series, and in my opinion, the best by far. If you only buy one Civilization game, this should be it. I got the DLC bundle with my initial purchase, and I'd recommend you do the same. I never played it without the additional content, but when I spoke to a friend, they didn't like it when it was vanilla, but once they got the additional content, they fell in love with it too. 
  I have not used any mods, and never will. They aren't needed.
   The one single thing I miss is the ability to stack units in my cities, which can be a pain when you want to beef up military force, or have to wait a turn to add a unit because a worker is parked there, but it's certainly not a big deal.
  It may be an older version than VI, but I feel the graphics and performance are on par with the most recent version, and I actually like the style better, especially the other leader cut scenes. The gameplay itself is certainly better than VI.
  Yes, yes, YES I recommend, but only if you're willing to find yourself losing interest in your other games.

   This review, of course, is only my personal experience."
12670,"Okay, here's the thing... This game is great. It offers so many different things to do and different ways to win and even when it starts to get stale you can find some way to make it enjoyable again. However, if you're anything like me, you will play the exact same way every game, try to rush everything with little to no strategy, either get leagues ahead of the AI or destroyed faster than you can build a single scout, and then somehow manage to add almost 30 hours of game play in 2 days. Overall, I can't recommend this game enough But I don't recommend starting up a new game to show your younger sibling what the game is after getting Civ VI for Christmas, then pulling 2 all-nighters, pummeling the AI on level 2 to the point that you're the only one left in the lonely, fallout ridden world..."
12671,"Pros: It is an uncommonly beautiful game with great visual detail, lots of interesting factions, playstyles and a great replay value.

Cons: The UI is at times cryptic and the happiness falls without warning or explanation, and for some reason the multiplayer AI is intentionally broken with no option to fix it."

Rinse and repeat as many times as you like. It never gets old, as there are tons of combinations and even more randomness when it comes to map quality.

It only uses one cpu core, and waiting for the AIs to move gets increasing longer.
You don't want go to war, since making more units just makes it more tedious.
It may be somewhat playable on small maps, though still take quite a bit of time.

After installing some civilization mods, I had Santa Claus and Donald Trump constantly at war in one game, and in another game I discovered North Korea's civ, only for Kim Jong Un to denounce me the very next turn.

12730,"This game is my favorite game, might it be the beat game in the world? No. is it the best civ game? Yes. My review will only consist of the singleplayer since i havent played much pultiplayer except a few times with my friends who have played way ess of it so it is more to see eho gets second place but we have fun. Amyway...

The grapics: this is not even close to being on par with the graphics of nowdays, but that doesnt matter, the style they t for in this was much bette then civ 6. It is like the leader scenes and the map is part of it’s own little theme. while civ 6 was more genericly ”modern” 3d cartoon like models of the characters and such. And the icons are better here. And big thing for me: the menus are more readable (unlike a certain other game in this franchie who decided that slightly dark brown is a good sloghtly bright brown) the research tree is reedable and more structured then civ 6. But i better go onto the next category or i’ll just continue to go hard on how bad civ 6 look like

Gameplay: it is a cv game, you do yor sience, you do your millitary and (if you get the dlc which is not nessessarly needed butnrecommened) you do your religion. While on the topic of dlc. Yes they are here but i dont think i got mine before the budle of them all was on sale. And by hen i had played quite a lot of games. And i feel like the combat here is not as cluncky as it fells in civ 6. Now i’ll suprisingly say somethng good about civ 6: i wished the climate system from civ 6 was in civ 5, you know some days you just want to drown eveyone by unleashing the nuclear wrath of gandhi

Difficulty: this is not really my category to judge since well i am not the best at gaming. There are like 7 difficulty levels here so that gives you choice.

I hope this has been help full, and i apologize for the misspellings."
12731,far superior to civ 6
12732,very pog yes yes be sure to get dlc make game great yes yes
12733,i just wish i had friends to play with
12734,"Rule the world, nuke some people along the way. MAKE YOUR FRIENDS CRY haha      Hands down one of the best strategy games out there."

12737,Eh
12738,.
12739,Fun. Well programmed.
12740,good simulation. would be nicer if it was possible to multi play on one license within a home network
12741,"Top game, classic!"
12742,yeeee
12743,me pipe bomb me laddies
12744,"In a few words: This is a classic!

Long version:
This is probably my all time favourite civ game. Civ 6 was a joke compared to Civ 5.... Civ 5 IMHO comes second to Sid Meier's Alpha Centauri (SMAC) which I would argue acquired most of the best features. Although SMAC is getting old in the tooth now. Civ 5 has far more pretty graphics.

Things to note:
To get the most out of the game, you really need the two expansion packs: God's and Kings and Brave New World. I would also get the Babylon and the Korea faction addon(s) as they add two Science dominant factions that were missing in the original game. I played the game without any addons for only 100hrs, not realising this and kind of put it on the shelf. The two expansions make a big difference to the overall game.

If you love long drawn out games, this game can literally last days if you chose marathon mode and epic maps. Especially in multiplayer. A lot of people shy away from longer games but IMHO it makes the combat far more rewarding. If you play in fast mode, by the time you make a unit, it's obsolete before you even get to use it.

This is one of those re-playable games that you can replay a hundred times and never get bored of. There is so much to learn and so much to discover.

The map editor comes with the Civ5 SDK which is in the tools section of the steam library. I didn't realise till much later that the game even had a map editor which doesn't come installed until you install the Civ5 SDK through steam.

The game really favours very high resolutions. I think 4K resolution or 21:9 ultra wide HD make the game more immersive. Funny thing is that a faster, multi threaded CPU helps this game quite a bit. Though it's not too GPU intensive.

I might edit this reply in future. I've only played a few hundred hours and know that there is a couple of thousand hours of play-ability in this game. :-)

12757,very good
12758,Maybe the best entry in the Civ series its only competition is with Civ6
12759,"What can I say I love the game with 418 hours into the game at the time of this post.  I would say so. I'm a type person that doesn't keep or continue to play games a don't like. And in the strategy game world this one is one of my favs in this category. I suggest getting all the content with it as well. Creation tools available for making your own maps and what not. Lots of achievements, I haven't gotten them all yet at the time of this review but there is a lot. Thanks for reading."
12760,"Civ V is a turn-based strategy game developed by Firaxis Games. It is the fifth entry in the main series. Civ V is actually pretty easy to learn for those who are unfamiliar with strategy. This means that it is a great game for anyone who wants to try their hand at strategy games, outside of the RTS genre.

Civ V is all about building up a civilization from prehistoric times all the way to events passed modern day. You aren’t creating a custom civilization instead you chose one of histories great civilizations and lead them in a forward march of progress. With all the DLC involved there are 43 playable civilizations. Each of these has their own specialties and play styles.

Now there are many ways to achieve victory in Civ V. The easiest is just to run down the clock. Probably the next easiest would be to conquer every other civ and have a military victory. Or you can try and broker world peace through more diplomatic means for a diplomacy victory. Culture victory means you must spread your civ’s culture and become the most influential civ. And a science victory requires you to do the Apollo Program and be the first civ to the moon.

All these victory conditions make each game different as you can try different play styles with them. This adds to the game’s replayability value. To add to that replayability value you of course have plenty of different civs to choose from but also a wide range of maps. This means you don’t always have to slog it out on Earth all the time.

One of my favourite features that is not in the base game is the religion mechanic added in by the Gods & Kings expansion. This allows you to found and spread your own customised religion. I always find myself getting really competitive with this mechanic and end up getting in either holy wars or conversion battles. It is kind of a pity there is no victory condition for religion. This kind of makes it pointless to found a religion other than getting to choose it’s starting buffs.

Civ V has mastered the art of making you the player stay playing the game long after you should have stopped. This is the one more turn syndrome. Now Total War games suffer from it too but Civ does it better. Like a lot better. Now I’m not going to go into the details of why it does it better, instead I’ll post a video by Officially Devin that goes into that.

This one more turn syndrome makes you keep replaying the game as there is also something to do in the next turn. Whether it be a building  finishing up or a tile improvement finishing, or a research completing. There is always something going on and the game does a good job of showing you it in its UI.

At 10 years old I feel like Civ V has aged really well. The mechanics remain good, the graphics aren’t the worst thing in the world, and the amount of replayability it provides is quite a lot as already mentioned. All these factors have actually discouraged me from buying Civ VI which is the newest and latest in the series. The only reason I have ever considered buying Civ VI is for Sean Bean’s beautiful voice that narrates that game.

This honestly makes Civ a great game, the fact that I can spend 8 hours playing it without realising that 8 hours have passed, and the fact I don’t feel the need to buy the newest game is great. Not very many games have that kind of staying power.

I feel that Civ V, pretty much achieves everything a good game should. It has replayability, it keeps the player enthralled, the mechanics aren’t bad nor the graphics. Hell the game doesn’t even need the dlc to have access to half the features.

The game also is host to many community made mods that add things from allowing you to play in Middle Earth as Mordor, to adding more historical civs that can battle it out on Saturn’s moon Titan. This of course adds to the replayability further. And to make it even better it isn’t reliant on the mods to make the game replayable or better, it’s already great!

Overall I give Civ V a 10 out of 10 because the game achieves everything it sets out to do. It doesn’t just achieve them it annilates them. Honestly the fact that I can lose 8 hours of my life playing this game and not realise it makes this a great game, everything else is just icing on the cake.

Don't like reading, here's the video version https://youtu.be/J97hha9CNn8"
12761,It has much more options then previous versions.

12786,"This is the Civilization game that I enjoy more than any other. I like how the game no longer allows stacking of units, meaning that you don't end up with huge ""stacks of doom"" where a large number of units are all in one place. This spreads out your units more and makes wars more interesting.

 I also like the fact that each resource pays for one unit rather than for unlimited units. In other Civ games, if you get iron or oil, it allows you to make as many units that require that resource as you want. Which means if you don't have that resource, it makes it very difficult to compete with a player that does have that resource. In Civ 5, you know that even if you don't have a resource, you'll only be facing a small number of advanced units from the other civilization using the resource rather than an unlimited number. By requiring one resource source per unit rather than letting players build as many units as they want per resource, it makes games more balanced and less dependent on chance."

If you have a bad computer this game will run on any Potato

Great mod community that keep this game Fresh with new scenarios. I do recommend buying the DLCs.
It does have a small learning curve but it is not as though as other turn base games, you can start having fun early on if you play on easy difficulty. 

I like Civ VI as well but I prefer the classic Civ V. At today's price you are getting an amazing game that you will play for hours throughout the years.

12802,You'll think you've been playing for like 2 hours as you intended and then realize it's 4:30am and an entire day has passed. Great game but dangerous.
12803,amazing game
12804,"I would say this game is above average for me. When i compare it to some of my favorite games of the genre it is just not even close. If i had to put a score it probably around a 7/10. There is no story/campaign,not really. The game is relatively hard to understand at the beginning. I have tried to love it but i cant, not when i have played age of empires and battle for middle earth."
12805,"Time eating-ly addictive.  Don't start.  That way, you won't sink a month and a half trying to perfect Roman battle lines.  Just say no."
12806,"GREAT GAME, PLAYED 81 HOURS."
12807,I def would wait for the game to be on sale since you'll wanna buy the dlc later on to play mods and content that they add and took out to add as dlc. Still a great game thou
12808,great game
12809,A perfect turn-based strategy game if you have the time for it. Has everything you need and looks way better than Civ 6 anime style cartoon action. Its also cheaper ans less requirements without losing in graphics
12810,the best civ
12811,great world builder game
12812,"If you enjoy spending time with your friends and family, do not download this game. Your sleep patterns will be disrupted, you'll find yourself skipping out on social events, and time will literally vanish. 

10/10 game. Highly recommend."
12813,it a good starter game to learn the basic mechanics before you move to civ 6
12814,based
12815,Better multi player than VI
12816,"If you like 4X games, this is for you. You can easily spend hours on end with self-imposed goal after goal (I'll quit after I finish this unit / I'll quit after I finish this research / I'll quit after I finish this building).

Diplomacy is probably the weakest point of this game. AI just tends to be unreasonable at times."
12817,good game
12818,Pretty good ngl
12819,"If you enjoy losing yourself to this game hours at a time, hen this is most definitely the game for you."
12820,good game
12821,"Out of all the games I've ever played, including Pokemon handheld, playing CoD since the very first installment,  and Minecraft, I have to say that Civ V is probably the game I've put the most hours of any videogame I've ever played. It also, including all the DLC go on sale regularly to my knowleadge, and is the best possible bang for your buck out of any video game that has ever existed. 10/10 stars, would recommend. GAME ON!!"
12822,Better than VI
12823,Always end up playing this game until the sun comes up.
12824,"I have played over 400 hours of this game and am still garbage at it. In spite of that, its still one of my favorite strategy games of all time."
12825,"I love civilization management games, but I am often disappointed by how quickly the games move. While Civ 5's graphics are underwhelming, it is stunningly customizable.  I love it!"
12826,y
12827,"civ 5 good, great still for its age"
12828,"Civ VI is great and all, but I believe Civ V is my favorite of the series. It's just so finely tuned and satisfying to play!"
12829,"1800 hrs of play. Should tell you what I think of this game.
"
12830,"Great game, gotta have all the everything"
12831,just the best and solid turn based strategy game with lots of game play options.
12832,cool gam
12833,This game is epic
12834,funnnnnnnnnnnnn
12835,I love all of the titles in this series.
12836,i lover it tbh xx
12837,help
12838,Just... One... More... Turn...
12839,Truly a Strategic masterpiece with few to no flaws.
12840,its better than civ 6 in almostevry way but not all still better excpecialy on slae
12841,"Play with VP mod, otherwise meh game"
12842,This game is cool you can play it with a bad computer
12843,very fun
12844,really fun stratagy
12845,Dårlig
12846,"Hatsune Miku just denounced me and Gandhi nuked me afterwards.

All in all, worth every second."
12847,Best Civ game ever!
12848,"One of the best games I have ever played. (And, yes, it's still better than Civilization VI)"
12849,poggers
12850,it's awsome
12851,A legendary edition of Civilization series. Multiplayer has issues to sort out but on overall is very fine and optimised game. Much fun!
12852,"I've been playing this game on and off for many years now, and it just doesn't get old. It's a good bit of fun, both singleplayer and multiplayer. I certainly prefer it over its successor as well."
12853,The entire game revolves around you progressing through the industrial revolution. 0/10 Ted Kaczynski not approved
12854,"I like the game.

I didn't dislike the game.

Would recommend."
12855,"Great, want to play with someone."
12856,Timeless Classic
12857,Great game - thought it was boring on the surface before giving it a chance.
12858,very time consuming
12859,"Yes, screw Gandhi"
12860,"Classic game; won't ever disappoint. The sequel, Civ VI, may be fun, but I always return to Civ V."
12861,So much more refined with so many interesting and non-violent decisions to be made. A far better realisation of civlisation diplomacy than previous games where everyone just goes to war for no reason despite long term cooperation and what have you.
12862,really good game
12863,"so many different playstyles, tons of replayability"
12864,good game
12865,not   Good
12866,.
12867,My only thoughts anymore are war. 10/10 would nuke Rome again.
12868,I love this game
12869,Best strategy game ever
12870,"It is actually dangerous to start playing this game, it is a time hole, black hole."
12871,CIV V is the best of the CIV series. Get it today!
12872,it's alright
12873,"pros: i love this game. this game manages to stay exiting after you play for ages like i have. one way they do this is with extreme freedom of how you want to play the game. DLC improves this freedom a lot.  if you want a slow exiting battle of wits then do so. if you want a quick paced economy based civ then so be it. if you want an average paced game of world domination then great. if you want to stop the AI from winning a culture victory before you can enjoy the long late game future era then just turn it off the adv settings.

cons: there is no way to make your own world. that might sound like minor problem and it is but imagine being able to costomize your own world to be for example a navel superpower owning the seas but none of the existing templates really suit what you want. you can just make a world that suits your exact needs. i have also noticed that the ""huge"" world setting was a little small. it would be nice to have for example a ""extreme"" size which would be like 4 times the size of huge and could support maximum number of civs and city states all with enough space to expand borders. the ""extreme"" difficulty should really only be used with multiple teams of 3 and 4 or the diplomacy would be very stupid and complicated."
12874,The Dankest gamer ever
12875,"Missed out on building the Library of Alexandria by 1 turn.

10/10 would prioritize production over food again."
12876,its fun
12877,very noice. first Civ game
12878,it doesn't get boring fast at all.
12879,good
12880,"i've been playing sid Meyer's civilization since the 3rd installment of the game, and ever since, i'm hooked.
I do think the later added mechenics, such as the beliefs system is a bit wonky, but that is fixed in civilization VI. 
The developers made an enormous improvent with the haxagonal tiles, replacing the old squares.
i love this franchise, and even though i have civilization VI in the library, i sometimes play 5, just becouse it keeps being a very fun and addictive game."
12881,does be cool tho
12882,sick game
12883,"My ballsack was full, but now its empty."
12884,issa good game
12885,GOOD GAME
12886,"just like most RTSes you have to be fast. They fool you with turn base combat but the ability to plan your turns while others wait means nothing. Rather than relying on APM like Starcraft, you have to plan your resource gathering and tech in a way you get high food and production in turns before your enemy has the chance to declare war on you. To win you have to have a good resource tile mix, and to make sure no one else will find you and to have a good grasp on what is important per difficulty level."
12887,It's a big yuh from me
12888,Replayable as hell
12889,very good game.
12890,old but gold
12891,"700+ hours played, still enjoy it from time to time....  way better than civ 6"
12892,"played it a bit, kinda fun."
12893,Greatest ever!
12894,very fun and very very strategy based would recommend.
12895,"good gam, need work"
12896,...
12897,"Civlization 5 + Vox Populi Mod is the peak Civilization experience currently. 

I won't be able to tell anything new about this game that you haven't heard a thousand times. I wish the AI were better (it is in Vox Populi but still cheating), but this game is amazing nonetheless. I have been coming back to it over and over for 10 years. I had this game on ""another platform"" before I got it on steam and probably have ~1000 hours on this game.

I wouldn't recommend playing vanilla anymore, unless you are completely new to the mechanics because with the mod the learning curve might be too steep. Vox Populi adds complexity but its very much worth it. For example, forcing a leader who declared war on you, to become your bitch..i mean Vassal...after you defeat him in a hard war (wars are harder in Vox Populi) is soo satsifying. This is not possible in vanilla."
12898,The game straight up cheats
12899,"Hands down the best civ game there is, and there are lots of mods to make it so if it is not already"
12900,Cant get enough!
12901,Do it. Tis fun.
12902,I like the flow of the game
12903,"Civ V is, most likely, the pinnacle of the series (at 2020)

I've played every Civ game from the very first Civ I (which I love so much, so much!) up to Civ VI. From my perspective, Civ 5 strikes the perfect balance between complexity and fun. It is complex, but never so complex as to demotivate new players. It is hard, but never unfair (unlike Civ IV, which is tremendously unbalanced and forces you to cheat the AI at higher levels to win). Leader selection is adequate (unlike Civ VI, which is very weird in some of its picks), graphics are awesome (even at 2020) and can run on most PCs.

Great entry point to the series. Don't miss your chance!
And also great for the experience Civ player.

Also, you know what else is awesome? It is a little old, which means you get the complete-game-no-dlc-bullshit for a fair price! Isn't that nice for a change? :)"
12904,
12905,Fun even if you're mediocre at the game
12906,"My favorite board game as a kid was Risk. Unfortunately, I had a really hard time finding people who were willing to spend 10+ hours playing a game. Most of my family and friends would play for an hour and lose interest. So I have had the global domination itch for some time. 

This is the first Civ game I have played, but it sure did scratch that itch, and then some. In fact, I have been scratched raw. I just need one more turn. Just one more… this is my last turn… ok this one for sure is the last…. Yeah just one last go… ahh I just have to do this one thing… one more time…  
"
12907,one......more......turn
12908,I dislike that they are making me fill this in
12909,best civ
12910,Very delicious just like my grandma's french toast
12911,"as i'm finally getting close to 75 hours in civ 6, i'm seeing why i have like 500 hours in civ 5"
12912,Civilization V is the worst fighting game
12913,"Extremely fun and addicting. Easy to pick up, and hard to put down. Personally my favorite of the Civilization games. Plenty of nations, maps, and game modes to play with and always a new challenge to be had."
12914,replay is high
12915,"After putting in 268 hours of my life into this digital board game, its safe to say this is a half-way decent game."
12916,When playing this game you blink and in real life 5 hours passes. Ideal for a lockdown.
12917,It's ok I guess idk
12918,"maybe the best civ game out there, civ 6 is nice and all but the districts really annoy me, so it's just personal taste"
12919,"Played many hours of civ6, wasn't sure why my friends played civ5 for multiplayer. having played a bit, it still holds up."
12920,Still a great game even after all these years
12921,Probably the best in the series.
12922,much fun very good
12923,It's risk on steroids.
12924,"Ahh, yes, the Civ 5.
Ever since I was a kid, when I stumbled upon my first Civ game, which was probably the second one, I knew this game was well beyond me. Even back then, not understanding how to play and what's the point, I didn't think the game sucked, I just felt like my brain wasn't ready for this. This feeling came over me every time I'd see a Civ game somewhere, for the longest time. Even when I became an adult and went beyond my mid-20's. Finally, in 2016, coming close to 30 years old, I thought to myself 'This has to be time, right?'. I saw Civ 5 practically given away for a few dollars and I just couldn't say no. Even if I wouldn't play it much, it's just a few bucks, nothing can go wrong.
I download the game, still wondering if I'm ready for it or not, still feeling like that kid who couldn't get it. I turn it on, fiddle with the settings a bit and here we go.
Civilization V provided me with a strange journey, even on the first games I kind of felt like that dumb kid back then, but I knew that after some effort and patience, I'd start to get it. I was googling things, reading civ tier-lists, comments, forums as I was also learning things by myself. All this effort later, the game became a sort of meditation. There's no urge, I have all the time in the world to think things over. What tactics am I going to use, how to get my units there and WHY get them there? What direction am I turning my civ towards? Am I a good guy or a bad guy? Peaceful or a warlord?
My favorite maps are island-type maps, because there's this sense of exploration beyond your homeland. You can't traverse the deep seas for a while, there's a lot of things to consider and research. While climbing towards decent sea-travels, I would still have to think if I really want to skip some very necessary economic researches just to get on a ship and find new land.
There's always a conflict in the mind while I'm playing, because there are many things I could do, but I only CAN do a few of them, so choices matter - they pave the way for my empire, which way will that be, it's all up to me.

In other words, this is the kind of game that grew on me and let me grow as well.
I feel like, as years keep passing by, I keep coming back to this game with more and more wit.
This is a life-long commitment.

Well, fuck, yes I recommend it.
Regardless what the fanboys and girls have to say about the game series - Civilization V is the best one for me and nothing will ever change that.

Cheers."
12925,globalism speedrun
12926,"806 hours of non stop fun, and losing lol"
12927,Time travel: the game
12928,"Great game, incredibly immersive and strategically challenging."
12929,It's much better than Civ VI
12930,I like it better than VI personally.
12931,this is the game that i play [strike] once a year [/strike]  every day when i don't want to play rainbow six
12932,adad
12933,Great game much better than VI
12934,Recommended
12935,its an awesome game to play. you will end up playing longer then you realize.
12936,I lke it.
12937,Very difficult to stop playing
12938,"This game will suck your time away, which could've been used for other way more productive things.

Overall pretty good game 10/10 would never play again"
12939,Great turn based strategy game. Really fun to play with family and friends too!
12940,You absolutely must play this game at least once in your life
12941,Awsome game
12942,GREAT
12943,This game is awesome!
12944,Fairly well done and fluid. Very interesting!
12945,Just a great way to kill 12 hours of your life in a row
12946,that is cool
12947,Imo I really like Civ V over Civ VI.
12948,gud stuf
12949,gud gam
12950,Fun expanding my empire while enslaving the masses under my boot
12951,Good time killer.
12952,"Not bad, prefer 5 to 6"
12953,Its great fun
12954,eh good game better than Civ VI
12955,"I prefer this over Civ 6 for many reasons. The graphics in Civ 6 are too cartoony. The characters look like they drank too much soda, which is odd for historic persons, who often didn't have enough to eat. I don't like how unexplored regions turn into a map, and the concept of districts needs a redesign. Quests in Civ 6 are an improvement over Civ 5, but I'll stick with Civ 5."
12956,b
12957,it's all fun and games until Gandhi nukes you
12958,What a Gem of a game. Loved it for years
12959,solid stuff
12960,i have played every kind of civ for years now and this is one of the best ones i think
12961,Really good games to play with friends but when you playing online without friends lots of game will finished due to someone left
12962,its ok
12963,"Don't buy if you don't have a 1080p screen, there's no UI scaling"
12964,"papa like

12973,"love it!!
"
12974,"Excellent game with lots of replayable time
"
12975,Whale fishing? Clam fishing? Fishing boats? I can really tell that firaxis really did their research on the fishing industry this time around! Fantastic game!
12976,"Got to kill the greeks as the germans, hell yeah."
12977,A nice slow paced strategy game to while away the hours with some friends
12978,I liked how it involved making a civilation and taking over the word
12979,"Civilization is a game about strategy, technology, Trade Routes, Military, The World Congress and UN eventually, and so much more. I don't have a lot of time though, so that's all I'm gonna say for now, bye!"
12980,Sid Da kidd
12981,its civ 5
12982,Good Game
12983,"10 years later, still one of the best turn based games ever made.

DLC's are definitly worth buying since it expands the game and it'll get you more mod support if you have played the vanilla game way too much like me.

11/10
would definitly play again"
12984,fun.
12985,"Best game every, take over the world!"
12986,"Still excellent, better than VI"
12987,Un excellent classique!
12988,"Fun game, I have indeed enjoyed playing it."
12989,I actually prefer this to Civ 6 the game play is much more like original editions.
12990,Is good game? Yes
12991,"Civ 3 still my favorite, but this one's just as enjoyable."
12992,Tis good.
12993,Excellent details
12994,"WARNING : Once you start, it might be difficult to stop.

Play at your own risk!"
12995,"It's fun, and as easy or difficult as you want.   Just as good as the first, better than the last."
12996,is gud
12997,good game.  played many times.
12998,"Big fun. Many feels, all good."
12999,Me gusta

13002,love it its great ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhh
13003,"i have played for 1,078 hours. trust me THIS GAME IS GOOD!!!!!!!!!!!!"
13004,"Good time killer and if you can stomach the obvious bias the creators put on the leaders and to a lesser extent the rankings, it is fun."
13005,Best civ game
13006,yest
13007,Yes
13008,I have been addicted to CIV since the original and this is one of my favourite versions.
13009,yes
13010,"Even though it's not the newest entry in the franchise, this game holds up really well."
13011,great work out for your mind.
13012,multiplayer is a bit iffy but very good game
13013,It's okay
13014,Bester of Civi games... Good history game stuffs.... I am a bear.
13015,is good...yep
13016,I went from 0 playtime to 100 hours in a matter of seconds.
13017,"Thank god for my zoom semester because i've gotten to play this game a ton - I don't play a lot of games usually, but I've played hundreds of hours because it's so addictive"
13018,Civ just keeps on delivering!
13019,gibs 1 mo fuh reparashuns
13020,good fun and hours of enjoyment
13021,best civ is best civ
13022,"If you don't immediately rush The Great Library every single game, you're doing it wrong."
13023,I like this one better than VI. I really enjoy the grid or tactical view over the regular map layout.
13024,"I've been playing the Civ series for years, because it's so rich in micro-managing whatever elements you want to experiment with.., and conveniently suits my lack of a sane schedule. I can leave a game for months and be immediately immersed upon returning. Civ V is the most balanced IMHO. Just play it - you won't be asking for a refund."
13025,good game
13026,"yeeeeeeeeeeees
"
13027,It's awesome.
13028,Ruins your life.  Great game.
13029,very poggers
13030,good
13031,"This is a really good game. While it is fun to play both with and without the DLC, I've really enjoyed the additional mechanics that they introduce. The high amounts of variety between civs, and the random map generation make for great replayability. Fun with friends, although I prefer it in singleplayer."
13032,the best version of Civilization of all.
13033,gOOD GAME
13034,"Been playing on & off for nearly 19 years, this game is by far some of the best content. I'm not a fan of the newer graphics for civ 8 so if you like the classic feel of civ-1-4 with a bit of classic graphics by far the way to go."
13035,"Very engaging, satisfying game play, historical references are clever and well built in the game."
13036,Vastly superior to Civ 6 get this over that piece of garbage.
13037,CIV 6 IS LIFE
13038,It's okay.
13039,10/10 would plunge world into thermonuclear warfare again
13040,"Gateway 4X game.easy to get in to if you're new to map painting/waiting simulators. The artstyle in this is the best in the series imo.plenty of mods and overhauls to play it how you want.

The weakest part is the AI that doesnt play smarter on increased difficulty but instead just gets more bonus resources and faster production and research.
The AI is easily beat in combat especially on the water because they are bad at positioning and all they do is mindlessly throw units at your meat grinder.

Outside of gameplay you really need all of the expansions to really get the most out of it since the base game feels lacking in content.

Great game that will last you a long time but buy it and all expansions on sale to save yourself from playing the shallow base game.

"
13041,Its like Skyrim with more People and no Dragons.
13042,If you like strategy and not just mindless shoot them all then this game is it!
13043,"Get on sale only, fun game but not worth the money. Way too much DLC..."
13044,okay just one more turn
13045,It's not running on intel macs!
13046,"""Just one more turn"" later..."
13047,ultimate strategy game

13055,500 x better than Civ. 6
13056,Game good
13057,i love it interesting and not overly hard for any person to play of any age
13058,"love this game, even more fun with friends."
13059,This game is the best game eveeeeer
13060,its ok
13061,its pretty fun
13062,Love this game...I played the original Civilization on Xbox and loved it...great turn base strategy game...I wish my old computer would run Civilization VI smoothly because it looks even better!!  Highly recommend this game and series of games!!!  Any Civilization gamers out there feel free to add me as a friend.
13063,I KNOW MY TROOP(S) DIED STOP PLAYING THE MUSIC
13064,"Very very addictive multiplayer they should teach about it at schools same category as heroin, 
P.S. Liberty forever"
13065,"good gob


"
13066,Sometime I will find time to write a review... maybe in just one more turn?
13067,"Good Game CIV six trash
"
13068,"This game is oddly addicting. The best part about it being turn based, is that you can walk away from it when you get busy and it's always there waiting for you."
13069,sid mayonnaise
13070,A grate game
13071,honestly i prefer this to civ 6 10/10 would recommend
13072,Very immersive - good luck :)

13074,gg
13075,Best civ yet
13076,"Having played Dune 2, Command and Conquer, Red Alert 1&2, and a few Age of Empires games in the past, I'm shocked that I never tried playing a Civilization game until now.

I know the above mentioned games are REAL-time strategy (RTS) compared to turn-based strategy, but honestly Civ 5 seems MORE strategic than them. RTS games seem like they've become more clickity click-a-thons and less strategy overall. Maybe this is just me, but Civ 5 was a breathe of fresh air compared to what I'm used to. I must warn you though, there is a TON of content here and it can seem overwhelming at first, but stick with it and play around and you should find something good here.

I will admit though, that the game is a little TOO addicting. Then again, that is one of the tags under its description!"
13077,"Easy to learn, takes a long time to get really good at it. Great to replay with a ton of scenario changes. Also fun to play as favorites from history, to see how it would play out with different landscapes and parameters."
13078,civ v good.
13079,"Good game I guess, still fun today"
13080,greta Game a different change of pace
13081,"It's a fantastic game, multiplayer with friends is a blast only downside is you need 10 hours to play"
13082,It's pretty good.
13083,good
13084,TIs Great game
13085,Classic - easy to get into
13086,Great strategy game. Worth getting even Civ 6 is out.
13087,"Its got a fun singleplayer, and its got a good modding community if you get bored if the normal civ's."
13088,"Super, extra"
13089,"my playtime counter is bugged, i've only played for like 30 minutes"
13090,"good game, shit for new players
"
13091,Best strategy game
13092,Oh cool
13093,great strategy game!
13094,"The vanilla version does indeed have balance issues. Cultural victory seems unobtainable. Brave New World does fix things up a bit and the religion and tourism mechanics offer some new curious ways of play, but it costs additional 30€. That makes 60€ combined for 10 years old game. That's ridiculous."
13095,"The game offers variety of interesting characters with different perks, so it's easy to find the right character for you. 
Vast selection of different paths for your country is also a really good feature. And of course trebuchets are better than catapults. Overall, the game is a really pleasant and interesting experience. Highly recommend."
13096,good
13097,still fun
13098,As realistic as it gets for a video game I guess. Get the base game with all DLCs on sale for a 10/10.
13099,"Best CIV illiteration there ever was should buy it no matter if it's on a sale or not because you won't get any better bang for your buck anyway, Online connection is kinda finnicky tho."
13100,"moy
"
13101,.
13102,It's a good game I guess.
13103,civ 5
13104,"One of the games that is my go to
"
13105,"good game try it 
"
13106,"Just yes... simply a classic, way better then CIV6 imho."
13107,good
13108,Fun 4X game. I liked the transition from squares to hexes. There are a handful of bugs you have to restart for occasionally. And the multiplayer is unreliable.
13109,ruined my life. I could not put it down. I was going into work with little to no sleep at all. If you value your sleep do not get this game.
13110,I LOVE THIS GAME!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
13111,Cool
13112,Still good.
13113,WOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
13114,"It crashes on startup. I played with no issue for a few days but  now it does not work.

EDIT: I restarted my computer and that fixed the issue."
13115,Amazing game over all.
13116,i fucking hate this game
13117,One of the best strategy games I have ever played. Easily the best Civilization game to date. Immersive and replayable with plenty of mods and add-ons to keep one entertained for days.
13118,great game.
13119,One of the best strat games out there
13120,its an amazing game
13121,This is the only game that has consistently remained installed on every computer I have.
13122,It's cool. Getting to know a bit more about civ games
13123,It is okay I guess
13124,Great game. You will lose hours of your life to this game. Well worth it!
13125,"It's nice, i like it ;)"
13126,"Though not perfect, this game is a masterpiece, the gold-standard for turn-based and grand strategy games.  Better than both its predecessors and successor (and spin-off), it is what the industry should use as the baseline/foundation for new games of this sort."
13127,like civ 6 but more politics and more yield p*rn
13128,"My fav. Civ game, its great, can play it for hours."
13129,"The detailed turn by turn strategy aspect makes me want to bring in enough players to crash the game, every game."
13130,okay
13131,it is a lot of fun
13132,One of the best games I played!
13133,Highly recommend purchasing with all DLC when on sale instead of Civ 6.
13134,good stuff that
13135,great game
13136,just finished my first game
13137,"For some unknown reason, I didn't go for Civ 6 but purchased Civ 5 and started to enjoy it. My memory of ""one more turn"" is back. And the hex map is good to explore the world with new possibility. With all DLCs, I feel I can play it another hundred of hours, just when Humankind, another interesting and emerging 4X title, comes out."
13138,ITS AMAZING I LOVE THIS GAME ITS SO RELAXING
13139,worth
13140,Best civ imo
13141,still trying to get out of the tutorial
13142,Pretty fun great game.
13143,Very addictive
13144,it's fun. idk.
13145,"Well, I have played all the version of Civiliztion over the years, up to and including Civ VI and as far as I am concerned Civ V is the best out of all of them.  I actually do not like Civ VI.  The only thing I don't like about Civ V is the update that added religion.  If you are going to have religion, at least have a non-religious (atheist) option where you get a bonus for science.  Overall though, a great game, that I have spent way to much time playing, and appreciate the wide choices of cultures to play."
13146,Good game.
13147,fun game
13148,"Over 100 hours... 9/10 I wish they would add a way to custum make maps in the real game, I dont like using mods! Some are NOT trustworthy."
13149,This was my first turn based game. I really fell in love with it! Lovely graphics. Definitely going to be a long time favorite.
13150,"A very fun game to play by yourself or with friends. Some pros are that it doesn't require a good pc, and I feel like you could get hundreds of hours of entertainment from it. Some cons are there's a bit of a learning curve, and if you want to play a game well it's gonna take hours. 8.5/10"
13151,One of the most addictive games of all time. Be warned
13152,it's ok
13153,pretty neat
13154,Mega Game...I cant stop playing it year after year :)
13155,Bra spel
13156,"Are you into BDSM or an absolute Cuck? Well, you'll love this game either way"
13157,wish i had more time to play
13158,I enjoy playing this game. And I don't enjoy playing most games.
13159,"My favorite Civ game also my first steam game, great stuff"
13160,Absolute Crack
13161,Everytyhing its so fucking awesome my dick gets hard just thinking about it
13162,"Still a great game. 
"
13163,"Over the years CIV gameplay has gone from enjoyable complex to overly complex. Graphics has gone from crude to ""just right"" in terms of detail vs easy overview ... to overly complex in this edition. Even with these drawbacks CIV is my favorite strategy game of all time!"
13164,you can warp 6 pm to 6 am with this game
13165,"The ultimate micro-manager's game. If it was tied into SimCity where you could manage the individual cities and then perhaps railroad tychoon for the later stages of the transport system, it would be all encompassing. Sitll even the macro levels of the game are highly enjoyable."
13166,"Great game, it can be a bit annoying sometimes, but as soon as u get a giant death robot (actual name of unit) you forget all those moments! you can basically enslave other countries by extorting them. its pretty nice."
13167,"ayy lamo
"
13168,Best strategy game.
13169,yes
13170,"Overall Great game,but it has some issues.It is very buggy and slow on some of my machines .Recommended if you like very fun strategy games."
13171,"great game
"
13172,Good game would recommend
13173,is fun sometimes
13174,"very dope, much chuchness
"
13175,ADDICTING!
13176,Ive always loved Civ
13177,"It's a classic, pretty good game although it is MUCH better if you have the 2 expansions lots of fun can be had with this type of game."
13178,It's just fun!
13179,Play the damn game
13180,Amazing and the workshop keeps it fresh
13181,For some reason it looks like I'm stuck in ragging barbarians mode. Also it seems that the IA of the game is increasing the level of difficult each time I win. Pretty annoying!!!
13182,Best in the series
13183,Nice
13184,e
13185,"I have put a wicked amount of time into this game. I love it, it has a stable economic system and a stable war mechanic. The AI loves to suprise you."
13186,"Classic, turned based, city builder, strategy."
13187,Yes
13188,gud gam
13189,good game
13190,"I love the fact that you can choose any civilisation. The game is maybe a little bit long, but still very interesting and fun. If you like table games, you will love that game, where you need to move your troups to destroy every other civilisations, such as a strategical table game. I played a lot and I still love it. Give it a try !"
13191,Still the best game in the series
13192,"best turn based strategy game i've ever come across, and one of the first i came across. i haven't found a historical based strategy game like it."
13193,Nice.
13194,10/10
13195,This is a very good game to play with. For lovers of sophisticated games.
13196,Y U DO DIS Ghandi???
13197,It's good
13198,One of the best games I've ever played in my life. 100% would recommend
13199,uh good game
13200,"Civ will never get old to me, the perfect game."
13201,I love any RTS games and this is one of the best!
13202,i love this game
13203,My friends are dead to me
13204,it's aight
13205,its a good ass strat game
13206,"This game has completely consumed me. :) Don't start this game if you want to get stuff done or be productive IRL in any way. I've been consumed, tbh. One Full Game takes like 20 hours or more, so, it's easy to get sucked in and forget who you are as a person. 10/10 recommend for people with depression (like me). It makes you forget about the real world. V chill."
13207,Civ 6 < Civ 5 that's it
13208,"If you like grand strategy games and world history, you'll probably like this one"
13209,good to just chill and play when you want
13210,Nothing better than being a turn away from a science win then getting nuked by your friend and watching it all crumble away.
13211,Best history game ever made.
13212,
13213,This...this doesn't suck.
13214,The best PC game ever!
13215,"Much fun to be had. Play it over and over and over and over and over. Superb price point for one of the best versions of the game.

Shovel your time into it like coals into a steam train. Dive deep and forget to breathe. Set computer to sub-human and dominate the globe. MMMMMMMMmmmhhhmmmmnnn, fill your life a conquistador's spirit."
13216,"This game was a labor of love to these developers. They have perfectly crafted turn-based, simulator  strategy game. I grew up on this sh*t, so it means a lot that they're updating it, and keeping the community, and me, happy."
13217,"STEAM... awful middle man... ruining my game play.  I just want to play Civ... I do NOT want steam... but alas... common sense loses out, I have to have STEAM to play civ.  Problem is... STEAM has a log in issue for me, so all day I have been logging in, changing my password only to log-in and... password incorrect.  But it's not... I JUST changed it moments ago. So I tried again... and again, and again.  All day, reset computers, dumped caches, uninstall, re-install...... ALL DAY
Is there a problem with my game? NO.  ITS STEAM.
I DO NOT WANT STEAM.  I WANT TO PLAY CIV...
you know... like I paid for....."
13218,"I have dabbled a little time away into this game. I have mere schratched the surface, so an in depth review has to wait, but early signs is good. I am liking what I see so far."
13219,much better than previous version played. (Civilization 2)
13220,"Good world building. ""Just one more turn.."""
13221,yes
13222,"Civ V is the pinnacle of the Civilization games.  If you do not know the series, seriously, WHERE have you been for the past few decades?  I have played the entire Civ series but this one claims more hours than any other, or any other game of any sort.  

While it is possible to play faster run-throughs, I prefer the long, slow traditional mode.  I can always start a game, then finish it after a month break if life calls.  

The tedious city management good players were forced to do (for peak performance) in the past is unnecessary but you can still get into the cities & change details if you wish.

Dislike the time spent on films of wonders?  ( why skip such satisfaction?)  That is ok because there is an option to skip the videos, or to play them again (if you wanted to show one to a fiend, watch it again, or just see what happened while you were afk).

There are special campaigns available and a vast host of historical leaders.  The leaders are well thought out & well-balanced unlike some that seemed less balanced in the past.

You can play any way YOU wish, as a peacenik, as a conqueror, as a wonder builder, a master of trade or as a king of pop culture, setting victory conditions to match your selected play style, or even to weigh it heavily against the opposition.

You can start at different ages in Civ 5.  Some despise the thinking involved in slow starts & prefer the fast movement of modern games, so this was designed just for that sort of player.

The city states offer vast variety for trade, military cooperation & especially for luxury & strategic resource acquisition.  If your play style does not mesh well with city states & you dislike an AI opponent having 6 allied city states to help stomp you out, simply disable the feature.

Unlike prior versions, Civ 5 does not rank capitalism above the value of fascism or communism, but somewhat balances the 3 against each other.  This is an interesting development.  So long as players realize that it is a game construct meant to offer viable alternative choices & not a reflection of reality, this is not an awful move.

The ONE thing I find annoying is that you cannot trade technologies with either AI or real world players.  This reduces the ability of a master player to gift children & strategy neophytes with boons to help them learn the game without getting stomped into snail snot."
13223,Just one more turn
13224,"A true gem of a game! My favorite is Washington, any other civ can kindly lick my male bits."
13225,"I don't really like it because I'm bad, but the gameplay is good if you like these kinds of games."
13226,i have logged over 353 hours on this game i love it and would say if you like things like this it is the wa to go.. it is the best one i havve played even beating 6 if you ask me but i mean do me wrong 6 is gret in its own right.. but 5 oh god to me is and always will be the best...
13227,This is an awesome game for anyone who wants to have a ton of great plans to take over the world.
13228,best dictator simulator
13229,it's like chess and AoE together.
13230,"My game has stopped working. I reached out many times to steam and have not heard from them. I checked properties, file validation and it claims I am missing one file. I tried to uninstall and then install same thing. I really love this game and I am upset that I can't play it any longer. I wish steam was a little more responsible and assist me with this issue. Is anyone lout there experiencing the same thing? When launching a box pops up and says Code 53"
13231,lol
13232,"Smell game for smelly folks
"
13233,Great for a relaxing gaming style.
13234,Solid time wasting application.
13235,Amazing and addicting!!!
13236,"Good, simple combat and progression. My favorite civ game."
13237,"Just a worse version of PAT.
"
13238,Playable infinitely
13239,"I like to play on the lowest difficult, then destroy everything I come across."
13240,malgre un pc défectueux je jouais quand meme pour dire que le jeu est bien
13241,"A great variety of features (e.g. lots of civilizations, technological progress, religion, culture and policies...), making you start thinking of what kind of path you will follow at the start, surprising moves from your enemies and therefore encouraging you to use your creativeness so as to come up with feasible strategies."
13242,yes
13243,its a fine game if you like turn based games ..no major glitches or play stoppers ....easily understood game play
13244,"I have played Civilization for over 20 years in all its incarnations, and I wouldn't hesitate to recommend this (now) vintage game to anyone who enjoys strategy."
13245,Depending how you feel about stacking units its solid Civilization though through and through. Complete edition under $10 is a winner.
13246,one more turn... hundred + hours later...
13247,"It's great, YES!"
13248,"yess
"
13249,Good game
13250,it was fun
13251,"ahhhhhhhhhhhh

"
13252,good game
13253,Good game but multiplayer is shit.
13254,"This was and hopefully still is one of the best Civilization games to date.
Tons of variation and customization, huge maps, great multiplayer focus, lots of expansions, steam workshop support, and plenty of hours to sink.
Of course there are still multiple victory conditions, tons of unique units, and plenty of Ghandi memes. Thats Civ for ya. My only complaint is that I don't play this game with my friends enough, and when i do, oh lawd the lag..."
13255,classic. dunno what else you want me to say.
13256,lit
13257,if nebuchadnezzar builds the great library before me one more time I will nuke every goddamn luxury tile in the game.
13258,"very fun game. not as good as IV, but much better than VI."
13259,The game itself is incredible.  But it continually just stops or reboots my computer.  Multiple computers.  I would not recommend this game until the manufacturer or distributor fixes this problem with Windows computers.
13260,It alright.
13261,"I bought this and it does not work well with the latest versions of Windows. It works fine on older pcs. So, I would not recomend it for laptops with 2017 and newer design."
13262,it's fine I quess
13263,great addition to civ library
13264,how dare you ask if this is a good game. go back to minesweeper
13265,its just fun
13266,One of the best strategy games ever. Strongly recommended.
13267,"Still to this date, never finished a game."
13268,"Its alright, bit boring without the DLC"
13269,I lost most of the use in 1 of my hands & this lets me game without having to use a controller.
13270,I still like V more than VI
13271,I'd rate it a 10/10 It'll always keep you up at night
13272,Just one of the most amazing strategy games ever made

13277,just one more turn.....
13278,What's there to say? Fantastic iteration of the civ series.
13279,always a fun classic
13280,stinky
13281,New world order simulator 2020
13282,Yes
13283,Very fun game.
13284,"If you are looking for a game you'll want to play over and over after the first time playing it through, this is it!"
13285,"A really captivating strategy game. You start a mission and plan on playing for 2 hours, when you look up the second time its 3 am."
13286,Lost many a day to this in depth masterpiece
13287,"great strategy game
"
13288,yea i mean get the game
13289,Great gameplay but im still looking for a civilzation based game as this but with more army and single person grouping and interaction( train ten archers and be able to strategicly advance or train sevn workers and put 3 on trees 2 in mines 2 on chickens and such
13290,deez nuts
13291,"With LEK mod and map's (S/O to OG mods like NQ and HellBlazer's Map) constant development past the life cycle for Sid's team, you can have an extremely enjoyable gaming experience that far exceeds CIV 6's decentralized cities while still maintaining the 1/unit per tile strategy. When on sale, I would purchase in a heart beat. I loved Civ 3 as a kid, but nothing gets me like Civ 5. 

"
13292,legi
13293,adictive game
13294,It's very very good and I played many hours enjoying it - the only thing that is a bit annoying was the same kind of play you're used to play it and the ai is somewhat to strong or (at different choosing) to weak and it bores the hell out of you
13295," The gameplay is very addictive you should try it. Also This game is old as most 10 year olds, hence tells me you are a cheapo. Then this is for you. You cheapo."
13296,A classic. Not much that you can say about it that can do it justice.
13297,col
13298,"I normally don't like strategy games, but even as a novice this world is addictive, dynamic, and consumable. I've thrown myself into the tutorials and now play online with a long time college friend. The depth is endless and a bit overwhelming at first. But learning to master the nuance is the accomplishment. And getting to wage playful war on friends is well worth the money. Must get!"
13299,Good for destroying friendships
13300,"You can be Ganhi.
10/10"
13301,It's an averagely good Civ game.
13302,invade invade invade why arent you invading yet
13303,Is fun
13304,amazing
13305,The best CIV on PC that aged super well. Civ VI might as well be a different franchise.
13306,"Once you start, you'll never stop. The best game in existence."
13307,I have turned the science of genocide into an art
13308,Excellent version of a classic game. I have and will play this for years.
13309,awesome
13310,very good game
13311,good game
13312,"bruh dis game is very guud
"
13313,Just... One... More... Turn...
13314,cool
13315,A very good game
13316,well its a really addicting game like i cant wait what happens on the next turn its fun with friends but it takes forever with turns and then if you cant get the group together you have to restart that campaign.
13317,"fun
"
13318,Good game.
13319,"Years later, this game remains an exciting entry in the Civ series, with twists such as the single-unit-per-tile restriction that add a tactical element not found in previous versions. While my laptop computer doesn't run the latest Civ6, I find Civ5 to still be entertaining and holding up well in 2020."
13320,yes
13321,Is Stellaris but on floor
13322,"Maybe not a game for everyone, but if you enjoy slow-paced turn-based atmospheric games this is probably a good fit for you! Great educational game as well, has an in-game encyclopedia where you can learn a bit about history and the various milestones of mankind. I am very impressed that each civ you play has it's own music both at war and at peace, it really adds to the atmosphere."
13323,great game.
13324,"As a fan since Civ I, this is a great game. Still choose this to play over Civ VI, which for some reason I haven't been able to get into with the changes."
13325,very fun
13326,"Civ 5 is a wonderful game that has incredible replayability value. Personally I would recommend you play with a science slow mod and on marathon or some slow setting. That is, if you want to have wars during time periods and by the time you march your armies to your enemy they arent killing your spearmen with tanks. Its a slow game, dont expect to finish in reasonable amounts of time. Make sure you have a good PC or youll wait 10 minutes between turns at higher rounds. Also, if you play on diety, disable all victory types besides conquest. Everyone should take a crack at this game, and skip Civ 6. Good luck yall!"
13327,its fun and entertaining
13328,very good game
13329,its cool
13330,Great game. I play a lot.
13331,Hour upon hour of entertainment
13332,haha nuclear hellfire go bRRRR
13333,One of the best Civ versions
13334,It's very good.
13335,"Literally grew up with this game. 

Dad brought it back from when he worked abroad when i was a youngin. The guy behind the desk said it was going to be a grand game in a few years, and he was definitely right.

Buy this game, its bloody good an that.

Cheers for the 9 years x"
13336,fun and really cheap
13337,"Great game, love it"

13339,"i lose track of time when i play this game

13343,not very good

13345,"Civ V is the most replay-able game I have ever owned. I just don't get tired of it! I love that it is turn based, which means you can walk away from it whenever life demands it, but you might not want to. Many times an hour has slipped by when I thought I was just going to play a ""few more rounds""."
13346,Best Game Ever.
13347,Better than IV. Better than VI. Better than almost anything else on the market.
13348,So much fun you'll always want to play one more turn...
13349,One of the funnest games I have played throughout my childhood. Remember when it first came out before all the DLC. Still keep coming back to it after all these years. Plus Civ VI kinda sucks right now too.
13350,easy to put tons of hours into
13351,Great
13352,"Not a very stable game, very difficult to continue a game with friends because of all of the bugs/crashes. Happiness mechanic is garbage, lots of maps will not have any sugar on them and your cities will demand it softlocking the kingday bonus, and multiplayer warfare is nearly unplayable, basically Civ 6 is a much better game in every single way."
13353,From my playtime you can tell this game isn't addictive at all...
13354,years of fun
13355,"learn history, turn based so you can play it along with doing something else."
13356,you know what your getting
13357,my first pc game and in its own way it is still the best.
13358,"Its taken my life away
my wife is gonna leave me but at least im about to beat india"
13359,Good and fun game to play either as a single player or multiplayer
13360,k
13361,Best turn based game I have ever played.
13362,It's fun and nostalgic
13363,"This is the best civilization game.  Great for people who love politics, history, and foreign relations!  Civ 6 is a fucking disgrace!!!!!
9/10"
13364,"Love it since 2010. A decade of knowing, prob my first favorite real game. Finally got it for myself."
13365,good game
13366,this game is great i would highly recomend it for kids ffrom 9 to 12 years old.
13367,solid tbs
13368,playing single player civ is funny as hell :D ai hate you building citys near them xD i end up destroying them with a flick of the wrist though PADAROU
13369,This game is a fun strategy war game.
13370,better than civ6
13371,"Yeah, my review isn't gonna sway anyone. This series has been out too long for the world to be looking to me for guidance."
13372,"Personally the best one in the series, I feel as the 6th gives you less space, but still adds some good things, but this one is still the best one, this one also redid the culture, and added city-states, and not to mention the steam workshop support, altogether a great strategy game."
13373,Attractive game
13374,"Awesome through and through, liked everything"
13375,worker machine go brrrrr
13376,Classic
13377,Accidentaly left the game on for 125 days on my laptop
13378,"One of my all-time favourites. Gameplay is so engaging and addictive that I have to warn those that want to try it DON'T PLAY IT IF YOU HAVE A BUSY SCHEDULE!!!

When you get invested in a match time will straight up disappear, usually 7-10 hours at a time without break. And when you crave to see what happens the next day say goodbye to any plans you had cause you'll forget all about it.

""Just one more turn"" isn't just an well earned expression, it's a warning.

P.S The Iroquois can suck my science"
13379,"I am a big fan of strategy games, and Civ V is probably the best game in this genre. Look up game play videos for this Civ V. Does it look interesting to you? Then get it. Simple as that. DLC is great too, and a must in my opinion."
13380,ggood
13381,"It would be nice if it were more combat focused, and if movement in general were faster, but it's considered a classic for a reason."
13382,Best CIV game funnest when playing multiplayer.
13383,more fun then 6
13384,dangerous but so good
13385,"This game is incredibly addictive. I didn't really understand why until I started playing. The design is excellent, the gameplay is smooth, and the complexities are explained well through the advisors, so learning to play is easier than you might expect."
13386,hehe good gaym
13387,amazing game singleplayer or multiplayer. Civ 5 and civ 6 are different experiences so would recommend both. super fun with friends too. The civ 6 community is much bigger so if you are looking for a gaming community go civ 6
13388,good game but crashes a lot on windows 10 unless you play on DX9 for some reason
13389,yes
13390,"rush the great library
if you dont get it, restart"
13391,thoroughly enjoy playing this game. very well made. better than 6
13392,"honestly one of the greatest games made imo. Late nights with friends playing this have made up YEARS of our memories. Civ 6 is awesome too, but there's just something special about this game"
13393,A great strategy game!
13394,"I didn't care for the game initially, but as I played it, it grew on me.  It's now my favorite Civ game.  I mean, Death Robots, c'mon!"
13395,gud
13396,This is lit yo.  Would recommend.  am denny
13397,"I usually don't like strategy games (I prefer more quest based, RPGs, or simulation games), but this is a great game. It appeals to my interest in history and culture, and is a great crossover for simulation gamers, like myself. The game is easy to pick up, but still challenging enough for seasoned gamers. The music is beautiful, and the graphics are actually quite nice. I find myself starting a game, and not even realizing that 4 hours have gone by."
13398,I prefer this version to Civ VI
13399,good
13400,Better then Civ 6.
13401,Is good. Makes wire box cry.
13402,Get it on sale with all of the DLC and it's an immediate classic
13403,The expansions are a must own for this one. Without them the game is a very bare bones civ title. Everything included however and you'll get hundreds of hours taken from you in a every fun civ experience.
13404,this is the best game ever
13405,very good
13406,still great after all these years
13407,its civ 5
13408,good
13409,it's ight.
13410,though it is slow as shit its still a good game
13411,It's Civ5. It's good.
13412,i play it just to make time fly by
13413,Pretty good ngl
13414,"Yes
"
13415,"great game
"
13416,"love the game , but some times it seams the ''spageti coding'' fuks up the multiplayer games"
13417,Great way to waste your time.
13418,Time travel to the future!!!
13419,"Timeless game. that even today, still holds up."
13420,Very addictive game
13421,best strategy game out now
13422,Gewoon Klikken en alles overnemen
13423,There's a lot you have to pay attention too but that means there's a lot you can focus on to find what youre good at!! definitely fun
13424,Very good game. I'm so glad to have this game because it's very entertaining to be the... I don't know... emporor above all.
13425,"Compared to civ 4, this game feels like it had bits of it removed and resold as dlc. Bugfixes that are only part of dlcs is also one of the worst practices I've come across. Awful, awful, awful"
13426,"ngl  after playing this game i feel like destroying the world.
"
13427,sexy game
13428,It's amongst the most entertaining games I've ever played. It has great replay value.
13429,"Great game. I prefer it over Civ 6. Easy to pick up and play if you have free time. Also, you don't have to deal with the load times of CIV 6, and that's worth buying this game on it's own."
13430,"No other 4X game in recent years compares to Civ 5, despite being over 10 years old. 
5/5 Paws🐾"
13431,"Fun game lol 
"
13432,GOOD
13433,The best game.
13434,"A fantastic and fun way to waste time, ""Sid Meier's Civilization V"" makes for an interesting way to engage with ideas about history, technology, and other cultures."
13435,Bomb China.
13436,"i spend like an hour or two fighting over a rock with little to value for me, in a multiplayer game i will never finish. 11/10 would play again"
13437,I've love it from the 1st Civilization game.
13438,relaxed strategy at its best
13439,Civ 5 has all the depth and one-more-turn enjoyability of previous Civ games. The balance of the different civilizations feels better with this installment.
13440,Only took an evening to complete
13441,I love this game. I spend hours playing.
13442,this is one of the best and most balanced game in the Civilization series. would definitely recommend.
13443,"digital heroin 

(ps. played this on another acount)"
13444,YES
13445,fun to take over other civs
13446,I have played Civilization since Civ 1.  There is no better tbs game.  Civilization just gets better with every upgrade and expansion.
13447,The best Civ. of them all.
13448,10/10 would play another 3000
13449,"Fun game, never thought I would like a top down tile game but CIV 5 turns out to be one of my favorite games. There is a learning curve though so don't expect to jump in with no knowledge and rule the world, even with that said the bottom of the curve is still fun."
13450,I played the shit out of this game. I still play this game. Don't move past Civ V this was as good as it gets so far
13451,Iconic strategic war simulator at its peak. Multiple ways to win and many civilisations to play as make it fun for several playthroughs.
13452,Solid game. Even with Civ 6 being out something about Civ 5 always brings me back. Probably because of nolstalgia haha.
13453,it good
13454,Been plating since Civ 1.0.
13455,I prefer this version to the Civ VI version.
13456,Very big brain
13457,My favourite strategy game across many titles.
13458,nuke go brrrr
13459,"This game is great fun weather you are playing solo or online even if the people you are playing with are strangers. there are a few inconsistencys that open up the game to exploitation but if you play with people who wont use them its a great and fun game. i liked playing against the ai whilst i learnt to play and it didnt feel like they were just robots, they made tactical and social descisions you only expect from humans. over all pretty good game. :)"
13460,"I love CIV, easy choice!"
13461,Best Civ to date! Civ 6 is trash.
13462,The perfect game to experience history from the perspective of someone who briefly skimmed a outdated and poorly written history book. The only real downside is the time stealing effects of playing...
13463,I get to be the 600th guy to say it's better than Civ 6 POG
13464,One more turn
13465,.
13466,Fun game
13467,best massive strategy simulation game ever
13468,"This ruined my marriage and made me lose my job.
9/10"
13469,kinda hype
13470,"Very good strategy game, and even better with friends."
13471,Excellent game play
13472,"This is one if not he best of Turn Based games I've ever played. The huge amount of features this game has is so long that I can't list them one by one, the best thing I can describe to summarize it is that it has different strategic paths to victory, not winning only by military conquest, but by economic, cultural, technological and religious victory which makes it very complete compared to other games of this same genre."
13473,"For new players: look for a guide or play with a friend. It's a lot to learn, but once you get the hang of it. It's a lot of fun!"
13474,"There are many options to weigh in how to achieve victory, and each choice requires its own sub-choices. ""Many roads lead to Rome"" and deciding on which roads and why is half the fun."
13475,Easily grabs your attention for hours at a time. I would definitely recommend it to people who enjoy a good strategy game.
13476,"LOVE CIV V
DISLIKE CIV VI INTERFACE"
13477,if you dont know then just play it lol
13478,fun
13479,"it goood
"
13480,It's Civ 5. You can't go wrong.
13481,"Civ 5 is a great game but is now crashing on Mac OS Catalina. Can get 300 turns in and hit a crash turn that cannot be avoided. Ruins the game. 
Update: Still crashing."
13482,"The definition of ""just one more turn"" turning into a few more hours."
13483,Yes
13484,"Great game with lots of options to make it replayable. In addition, there are plenty of Workshop additions to make it even more unique."
13485,Best Civilization game!
13486,"A game for anyone to enjoy, really"
13487,loved it
13488,"game good :)
"
13489,Its a game even a senior can enjoy.
13490,"I have never played a game that is more fun then this.




























Yes i have, this game is meh"
13491,"A very realistic RTS game... I like it better than the newer one, and had to redownload it."
13492,The definitive edition of Civ.
13493,"Hello fellow kids! Today I learned about this new radical video game called ""Civilization Vee""! If you are a 100% achievement hunter, then gosh, do I have dope news for yall! Being only 953 hours in, I've already accomplished whoopin' 155 out of 286 internet points! Keepin' it Gucci! Peace out!
"
13494,still fun.
13495,yes
13496,Dont play if you value your free time.
13497,Great Game the best civ
13498,This is a really great game on every level.
13499,This is probably this best Civ game. I think it hit the sweet spot with its design choices where Civ 4 or 6 might have gone too far with the features. Old civ junkies will argue that civ 2 or 3 are the best but this is the #1 modern Civ game for me.
13500,Still better than VI
13501,Civ V and VI are my favorite games all time.
13502,yt5hgfm
13503,Just stuck enjoying playing ancient era
13504,"Good game, fun to play with friends, it's not overly complicated to pick up as a beginner, but the better you get, the more you know that you don't know the game as well as you think."
13505,like a tuna fish peanut butter sandwhich
13506,yes
13507,"Good, but perfect with mods"
13508,"Great game. Definitely worth playing, you can easily get lost in the ""one more turn"" cicle and spend countless hours playing. Ofc better with friends"
13509,"I loved Civ6 so when the black Friday sale came i toyed with the idea of getting civ 5 just to see if all the talk of ""civ 5 is way better then civ6"" talk was about so i bought it and omg i dont regret it civ 5 as alot more stuff then civ 6 from realistic reactions from drama with other civs that make the civs seem like there real people to more base content Today is the last day of the black Friday sale i Highly recommend this game HIGHLY"
13510,"Takes some getting used to, but when you know what you're doing it's extremely rewarding and exciting to play, especially with friends."
13511,nice
13512,"Superior to CIv VI.

Good diplomacy. OUPT is actually fun. 
Polished after all these years. 

"
13513,Okay
13514,"Civ 6 is probably better, but I haven't played it. This one's pretty fun."
13515,works
13516,I love taking over the world. Would 100% recommend you get all the DLC it makes the game just that much more enjoyable. Especially if you are just starting on the game it is easier to learn the game with all the game mechanics that come with the DLC rather than buy the base game learn it then have to relearn game mechanics when you get the DLC. The game will suck you in for hours and depending on the difficulty will really stretch your brain. Overall this is one of my favorite games I've ever played.
13517,"big fun, must play 100 100 100"
13518,"civilization is one of the best games of all time. this is known. this version lives up to that billing

im in love w these games"
13519,it is awesome!!
13520,this game seems to last forever but I love it
13521,"If you enjoy history, enjoy strategy games, and enjoy putting away a whole day just to play a game, then this is the game for you! Wicked fun game and can at times be challenging and competitive, especially with friends."
13522,One of the best games I've ever played and by far the best CIV game I have ever played. Would recommend to give it a play. There is a little bit of a learning curve to get use to it but once you do you'll never stop playing. Endless play through value!
13523,Its awsome
13524,Good game.
13525,One of the best games I have ever played!!
13526,Best in class.
13527,Amazing Game
13528,"Civ 5 might still be one of the best rts games out there, you can play it for hours and forgot time itself. you can always play it alone or with friends. i might have only played 200 hours, but i could easily put in another 200. soo yea i would recommend"
13529,Time killing machine.
13530,yes
13531,most a mazing game
13532,"Civ 5 is a pretty fun game.
Playing alone is fine, but I really like playing with others. It heightens the experience.
"
13533,"A wonderful game, I have been playing it for 10 years and I still enjoy it"
13534,probably the best strategy games out there
13535,A worthwhile part of the Civilization progress.
13536,"I think this is the best *start* for anybody who is thinking they might enjoy CIV games, but feel intimidated by the amount of management. This game was one of my first ""hard"" management games."
13537,fun
13538,My first play session was 10 hours long. Its pretty fun.
13539,Holy shit what a waste of time.  love it
13540,WTF I was supposed to go to work.
13541,better than civ 6
13542,It's ok...
13543,Addictive
13544,"Must download Vox Populi -modpack from civfanatics forums (google it). The AI gets smarter but with fewer unfair bonuses. Also the balance gets fixed, everything will be more polished, since it has been developed for like 8 years. It has incorporated in tons of other mods too so you won't need anything else basically. Autoinstaller & easy to use."
13545,Vely naiz flends
13546,pogchamp ig : (
13547,"great game as vanilla, lekmod adds a lot of balance and replayability"
13548,fun
13549,fun to play with friends
13550,Would you be interested in a trade agreement with England ?
13551,10 years latter still a banger
13552,Not sure about this game yet might need another 735hrs.
13553,4/5
13554,d
13555,All
13556,One of the best game ever!
13557,"Really fun, I end up playing for wayy too long in a session though."
13558,"it's a very fun and very strategic game. I'd definitely recommend to anyone who likes sim games
"
13559,Still the best Civ hands down.
13560,The best.
13561,"gameplay and graphics
"
13562,"This game has a lot of people who love it, that being said its hard to really put it down as anything but a good game. This game ain't no civilization 3 but times change and so do the creator's. I give you props developers for a great community that you created by making a wonderful product."
13563,"There is only one actual way to play this game.
Make friends, nuke friends. Make enemies, nuke enemies. Nuke everything! Nuke yourself. If every tile is not covered in fallout by turn 200, you have failed your task and will be nuked."
13564,"I love this game. I own both Sid Meier's Civilization V and VI. I have been playing Sid V for years, and it is by far, one of my favorite games. Definitely recommend it!"
13565,Garbage.
13566,"I've put 300+ hours in it, so I think I like it"
13567,FUN I GUESS
13568,"Outstanding 4x strategy game, best of all I've tried. Been playing since it was released about ten years ago and have graduated to playing and winning on Deity (highest) level.  I have tried many other 4x games by other developers but this is far and away the best of its genre. With 43 Civs, 41 City States, many maps and other game features including hundreds of Mods the replayability is endless."
13569,immortal classic
13570,gud game. best civ
13571,"Love this game, i would recommend it. Got it on sale with all the DLC's included. Merica!"
13572,"Classic, cannot be beat"
13573,Same ld Civ I love and remember with a few new twists. Fun during lockdown.
13574,"One of the best 4X games ever done.
Although if I'm being sincere, I wouldn't describe it as a Strategy Game:
It's a time machine that transports you forward to 4 AM on a weekday.
10/10 would recommend to anyone"
13575,"My sons bought it for me for Christmas, I enjoy the differing ways to win."
13576,Absolutely fun game. I've personally spent around 3 hundred hours on this and still find new ways to have fun. The workshop also helps keep the game fresh.
13577,"Enjoyable with some good updates to the series, but still like Civ4 better."
13578,yes
13579,Great game!
13580,Bloody brilliant backstabbing friends when they least expect it. 10/10
13581,"Buying this game was a mistake.
Playing this game was a mistake.
Still playing this game today is a mistake.
Please release Civ 7 so I can be free."
13582,"Best game ever, love it"
13583,Amazing. 10/10. Don't buy it if you have people in your life who care about your well being though.
13584,yes
13585,"Just a wonderful game. I will admit, the first hour or so is boring, but once you get past that you'll love it!"
13586,"is good
"
13587,"yfjdersh,mvfhdskjhg,mn ,vkvjnfkjnb,mnbcvnb"
13588,One more turn !!
13589,it is okay
13590,oij
13591,it's better with friends but still fun by yourself
13592,This is the best Civilization implementation I played (and I played over 600 hours). Definitely you should get it!
13593,IT is amazing
13594,"В общем супер классная игра , круче 6 части"
13595,Да
13596,Still absolutely worth both your time and money.
13597,better than civ 6
13598,still haven't finished a multiplayer game
13599,I swear I'll make a settler... after I finish this wonder
13600,Need to spend quite a bit of time becoming familiar with the game.  There are some great tutorials on YouTube.
13601,Fuck India
13602,It's a good game. Play it if you like board games where each game is roughly the length of ten Monopoly games played 17 times in a row.
13603,"They might not poo in the loo, but they will nuke you if you don't ""open bob""... beware of india"
13604,Best CIV ever.
13605,"good game, prefer civ 6 but this game will do to play with friends"
13606,this games pretty fun
13607,"so good! (Brave new world makes it 10x better)

"
13608,Its so much fun!
13609,its cool
13610,Gandhi kept starting a war with me. Guy can't chill
13611,Y E S
13612,The game often crashes for unknown reason.
13613,fun
13614,"I like very much this game because of colors, themes, historical  content and variety of civilizations. To me this is one of the best games of all times"
13615,"Like Civ 6 , except you dont have to pretend you are having fun"
13616,pog
13617,Best Civ game I have ever played. Still the definition of a grand strategy game.
13618,"Can I say anything that hasn't been said yet? The game is very fun, addictive like crack, hilarious at times, it's a must have for anyone who wants a good strategy game.
Just don't forget to get it with all the DLCs, Civ V is known to kinda suck without them. It's simply excellent if you have them though. I rate it 95/100."
13619,"Ok so I played this game anyway, and than this Thanksgiving sale came and I had to nominate something that I'd play afterwards. So I nominated Civ V and than played it. Than I had to review something that I nominated and ... you guessed it ... here's me writing a review in order to get a badge, for a game that has 104.900 reviews in this moment. And you're probably thinking: this is going to be something new and worth reading. That no one else wrote! No, no and no. Sorry.
BUT!
In short:
This is a great game. If you think you're gonna like it - you will. Buy it now on sale with all DLCs and knock yourself out. It's still the best one in the genre. Period. 
Also you can play it basically on a potato (I'm playing it on an 8 yo i7-8Gb laptop with only integrated graphic card). Since it's turn based, those 15-25 fps are really not a problem.
Cheers!
"
13620,Still a great game after so many years
13621,Just one more turn
13622,The only good civ is a V civ.
13623,<3
13624,This game is more addictive than opium - and I should know.
13625,"Holds up great 10 years later, arguably better than Civ 6. Should be cheaper but still worth it when compared to Civ 6."
13626,"Outdated in many respects now, with the advent of Civ VI, and its subsequent DLC/expansions, this is still an enjoyable play. Best played with all expansions + DLC, but that has long been true of Civ games. I would also suggest taking advantage of the many mods on the Workshop. Saying that, it does have some minor annoyances which were never addressed in updates, but that's unlikely to be changed now, so not worth worrying about. One of the areas where it does outdo Civ VI, I would suggest, is in the graphics. The world is lovely to look at with everything maxed, although the downgrade for Civ VI was, apparently, a deliberate simplification on the part of the Devs. Plus, the leaders look more like human beings, as opposed to Disney-esque characters."
13627,Awesome game to chill and play with some buddies
13628,"i like it but civ6 is better once you get in to it
"
13629,Brilliant

13634,better than civ 6. hours of fun. one. more. turn
13635,"-------------------
Patience is a virtue

Yep, an amazing strategy turn-based game which boasts a hex grid, with an interweaving of history and victory.
If only we'd stop telling ourselves ""One more turn"""
13636,Nukes make me moist
13637,Best strategy game.
13638,Good
13639,Love it!
13640,"Take a look at the hours played.  Look at it again.  That says hours on record.  There is so much game time that is not on record.  Let that sink in.  Good.  Now buy the game.  It's worth it.  Also, buy the complete edition.  This is a fantastic game."
13641,its okay i guess
13642,"Just played the tutorial.  Took a while to get through the Mechanics, since I was familiar with Age of Empires.  I found it frustrating that I could not select multiple units, but that is probably due to my own ignorance.  Regardless, I ended up logging like eight hours playing through the tutorial game.  It was fun the whole time and I learned as I went.  Looking forward to a real game, but will need to set aside some serious time!"
13643,"Through of my time from my own past, I enjoy playing this game with my friends so much and entertain through the whole day. Even though it takes a long time to play, but it was still entertaining as it last until you lost time. Until now and playing this game again with friends, oh my god its still entertain me so much and lost of time again. XD"
13644,amazing
13645,crack in game form
13646,cool
13647,Best civ game made
13648,"This game is not perfect. The Happiness theme is junk. It makes it very hard to actually grow your empire.

Otherwise, I like this game. Spent many hours playing it despite the Happiness issue. It is still a fun game to play."
13649,yes
13650,pretty good :)
13651,"I just realized I've never reviewed Civ V?  Oops.  It's such an amazing game that's so well thought out and so well done that there's nothing to review or talk about, because the entire experience is great.

My only kind of review is anecdotal, in that, back in 2010 when it first came out and I had a crappy computer, a buddy of mine worked at 2K games, and I was complaining to him that my computer couldn't finish Civ V end game scenarios, and all he said was, ""We at 2K make use of every hertz you have.""

NOTE:  I'm an old school gamer and I have a working copy of Civ 1 from the early 90's, which was my introduction to computer games, and I've logged more hours than anyone can fathom on Civ II, which tops my list as the greatest game of all time, and a large part of my life for the last 30 years is connected to the Civilization experience which has been a great refuge to me, yet I truly believe everyone who designed the new Civ VI should be fired!"
13652,Best Civ game still to date.
13653,:D
13654,"I love this game, but wish it had more interactive battle scenes."
13655,"Runs stable; more than you can say about other strategy games
"
13656,Classic and runs on my windows tablet.
13657,It's lit
13658,This game is still my Favourite Civilisation game. Great game especially with all it's DLC. Well worth a play.
13659,ill just play a short game...
13660,"one of the best

13664,best game
13665,best civ game so far
13666,Its ok I guess
13667,Best civilization version!
13668,"""Just one more turn"". This oft-repeated sentence has never been more fitting. With Civilization V (and all its DLCs), the series reached its peak: the game is so rich and complex, yet at the same time approachable, that improving on it seems a major feat. There are no few who have been disappointed with Civ VI, not because it was a bad game, but because of the high standard set by its predecessor. 

The recommendation is clear: BUY."
13669,Still Great.
13670,"[code]The best game, which has the best soundtrack and musics, in the Civ series[/code]"
13671,Thoroughly enjoyed this game. Many hours of game play and much more in depth than the console version.
13672,amazing game
13673,kewl
13674,This game is like drugs
13675,"This is the best Civ game in my opinion. I bought Civ VI when it came out thinking it would replace V as my favorite, but time and time again I keep coming back to V. Everything is streamlined, it's easy to follow, there's a lot to balance but once you get the hang of it it's pretty simple. The game moves at a reasonable pace and you get a different game/outcome every time you play. Truly a wonderful game. The only downside is the predictable AI and the warmonger penalties. The world congress is a great addition, but I always end up spending most of my votes trying to keep the AI from banning luxury resources. What's up with that? There's so much to choose from and they always want to ban the luxuries I need for happiness. I also hate how every city you take makes you the worst country in the world and no one else will trade with you... even if someone else declared war on you. There's no sense griping about it now since this game is done being developed. But like I said, I keep coming back to this game regardless. A timeless classic for sure."

13677,"Game is broken, and no fixes seen in the future. After each turn, the builder need to be reassigned the task. Probably why is was a sale item. Sad."

I honestly prefer it over Civ 6."
13687,love this game since i first got it
13688,"a lot of depth with G&K and BNW (not recommended without thos add ons!), and a lot of add ons to make it better, like InfoAddict, AlphaCentauriFactions and ReallyAdavanceSetup. I use the latter to play deity, and since I am not good enough at the beginning I give myself some bonus stuff. But than its tight a lot longer then on a lesser difficulty, which is hard only in the beginning and the last 40 turns are meh... I have won anyway."

13704,game is cool
13705,still amazing 10 years later
13706,"Its a fantastic game to play when you've got lots of time. However recently the game has continually crashed after the cinematic entrance is over. Have trouble shot extensively and had no positive results. Until there is a solid fix, don't purchase this game."
13707,Its the best civilization game currently on the market.

I got this game for 15$ when it still went on sale. I pity those who didn't buy it then.
You're lucky if the base game ever goes on sale again."
13716,Yes

13723,Game is good.
13724,You wouldn't get it. It's an inside joke within the community.
13725,Still better than Civ 6.

13754,"Look i like Civ VI, i really do. but this is like Pathfinder to 5E, in essence if you prefer a more drawn out, more complicated experience, then this is your game. if you prefer more rounded and generally more laid back games then head to VI. Either way, both fantastic evolution style command games!
"
13755,fun af
13756,I haven't played it enough to give a valid review... but i would say its pretty good
13757,"Truly, Civ understands the importance of hex and had the foresight to (briefly) give this game out for free - which I helped to distribute across the world to needy people. The DLC is a frustrating barrier, but this will be an enjoyable game for almost anyone. Play with a group of friends for maximum effect (it is similar to a board game in many ways)"
13758,"Personally, I liked this better than Civ 6 because the mechanics are much simpler to understand. Only con is it does not have the voice of Sean Bean."
13759,"I'm not really sure how to play, but it's pretty fun building armies and killing every human being not slaving under you to build your empire. You can finally get revenge on the Europeans that ruined Africa and led to most of the continent being left in poverty as the Zulu Tribe or the Ethiopians, killing their beloved leaders and enslaving their people to work for you. Or you can go full American, laying siege unto others in order to gain their metals, luxuries, and their sweet black gold, whilst leaving them extremely weakened and in financial ruin. The hypothetical scenarios are plentiful. Check it out."
13760,Great Game
13761,It's as fun as I'd hoped.
13762,"India in the real world: Wonderful country with amazing food and incredible people. Visit in the future.

India in CIV: Warmongering shitheads with a sociopathic lunatic for a leader. NUKE IT FROM ORBIT!!

That being said, I have actually put thousands of hours into this game and I love it every time. 10/10"
13763,"this game will eat hours of your life. be warned.
"
13764,"It's a great game delivered in a bad package, which overall feels like an unfinished product. I was looking to play this with a friend over the Internet in times of covid, and while we did end up successfully playing for many hours, the setup is sub-optimal and requires an unnecessary amount of work.

The online multiplayer on public servers seems broken, with network splits resulting in the various players ending up in different instances of the game with no apparent ability to rejoin. Several people are encountering this based on quick research. Setting up a private server using the provided SDK, on the other hand, solved this for us, but the server software has a number of pitfalls:

1. The server executable is on a directory of its own and does not run out of the box. One must manually copy the games' files over.
2. You cannot run the server and the game simultaneously on one computer, courtesy of Steam DRM.
3. Even though the game client is cross-platform, the server is Windows-only. Furthermore, the ""server"" is actually a full-blown copy of the game, runs in graphical mode, and has dependencies on DirectX and every other third-party library. So forget about running the server on a Linux VPS.
4. The mac game client is on a more recent version than the Windows and Linux ones and is not backwards compatible: joining a (Windows) server from a mac client results in a version mismatch error.

In the end, we ended up with a Windows box running the server, a mac laptop running the Windows client through Parallels (because of the incompatibility issue), and myself running the game client on Linux. Plus a VPN underneath to get all three boxes talking to each other, which would be unnecessary if we could simply host the server on a run-of-the-mill Linux VPS.

If the developer/publisher open-sourced the server with a liberal license, then maybe we could finish off the work and port this over to Linux and remove all the unnecessary dependencies. Ideally they could also open-source the client once they've decided they had enough run, or at the very least put the Windows/Linux clients on the same version as mac to make them all compatible.

This is otherwise a great game, brilliant mechanics and gameplay, hindered by an unfinished server product."
13765,the right combination of sophisticated strategy and intuitive gameplay

13799,My top strategy game so far.
13800,Have enjoyed the game for many years. Now along with the rest of the CIV games it will not load on start. The help section is just a circular list of the same fixes that don't work. Using Win 10. Not much point in spending money on what is now a tile on the computer.
13801,"Best game I have ever played. I was so sad when my disc for this game stopped working, but then I was so exited to find it on the steam store. This game is a lot of fun, there are so many different ways to play and win. This is definitely my favorite game and I recommend it to all."

13811,It was very fun can play for hours
13812,"This game by far my most played steam game, and it was excellent for various reasons. It really expanded my interest on history with their historical intros before beginning every game, along with the units/buildings unique to civilizations. The musical soundtracks were beyond perfection, sometimes I'd declare war on another civilization simply to hear it. The scenarios, which took me several years to discover, were REALLY enjoyable especially for players who hate the early game of exploring and founding cities. While the game is at first difficult to learn, definitely worth the buy and strongly recommend for any history/strategy video-game players!"
13813,Would you recommend this game to other players?
13814,can recommend.

13834,yes
13835,One of the best strategy games!
13836,its good
13837,"better than 6..



probably idk."
13838,"Even after 10 years, Civ V remains as the peak of the Civilization's franchise. The Core gameplay is great, it's easy to learn and easier to get addicted with the amazing amount of depth that this game has. 
It's only downside is the poor/outdated modding support. Despite the huge amount of great mods on the workshop, the experience is seriously hampered by compatibility issues and long loading times. By the time you figure out which mods are fun and which mods are compatible with each other, you will have spent hours reloading the game over and over again.

Either way, a must have for any 4X player... Just go easy on the mods."
13839,nice

13883,Quit complaining about the world.  Here's your chance to do it better
13884,"Even thought the game is old and Civ 6 has been out for years, this is still a true gem. The only bad thing is the  enemy AI which - like in every Civ game - is not good at combat. That doesn't mean it cannot give a casual player a challenge, but after some 500+ hours, you pretty much can win any match on any difficulty, if you play it right. Still, I keep coming back to the game over and over again. Also, the modding community has been incredible. There are tons of content in the workshop if you want some change. 6/5."
13885,everything's good except problems with online play sometimes
13886,The peak of the series.
13887,"I sunk more hours into this game than ever other game I've ever played, so I probably owe it a review.

Tried to get into Civ 6 but kept coming back to this one. Love BNW. Only thing I'll say is that to get the most out of Civ 5, you definitely need some additional mods. And getting mods to work with multiplayer is a pain in the ass but very worth it."

13892,"The visual beauty of Civ V and the drastic changes to the gameplay made me a fan of the franchise all over again. It felt like a whole new game, not a re-skin of my old favorite Civ II. Ten years in, I am still playing this even though Civ VI is available. It is very complex and I am still discovering new strategies and features I never knew about. While I love it in single mode, I can’t imagine playing it in multiplayer, as turns take so long in the late stages."

This is ridiculous that a very old European civilization (much older than Muscovy or Russia as it is called nowadays) doesn't have its official mod.
It seems that a French company Ubisoft has a strong bias against Ukrainian nation, purposefully omitting it from the list of its official nations."

13915,yes
13916,"Game has had several game crashing bugs for a few years without any fixes. 

Great game, but i can't enjoy it fully when several hour game session crashes without a save."
13917,works
13918,sean blitzes science every time pretty wack tbh
13919,"Nuke Boston -> Been praised for briging peace 

10/10 would do it again"

13921,Great game

13923,GG
13924,
13925,Can be rather addicting...
13926,"My name is Loner, and I am a Civiholic. Civ 5 has damaged my ability to sleep and carry on a normal life - that is all."
13927,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UcQeS2lAHps
13928,good
13929,"Civilization 5 is more addictive than crack
"
13930,"Great game, like all Civs"
13931,"It's a classic, definitely has some qualities that are better than newer 4k titles."
13932,Still better than Civ 6.
13933,Keeps me busy for many years
13934,"One of the greatest strategy games in my opinion. The dlc is a must have as it takes the game from a 9/10 to a 10/10. The game and dlc alone is supper fun and will take a long while to get old, but when it does, there's thousands of mods to spice up the gameplay. The only criticism I can offer to the game is that the AI can be unreasonable sometimes and multiplayer sometimes are be a tad buggy. Also multiplayer doesn't support most mods."
13935,the gameplay is awesome only thing i disliked the text on the tutorial was alot to read up on so i found just reading the basics should suffice then play around in the tutorial to figure it out more
13936,"First of the civilization series to adopt hex tiles.
Remember hexagons are the bestagons lol

I recommend Civilization 6 over 5 if you have a strong computer
I recommend Civilization 5 if you have a laptop or older computer. Civ 5 has most of the entertainment value of 6, but runs much faster.

6 has hex districts done much better"
13937,"after logging over 1k hours, i'm stIll working through all of the DLC content and mods."
13938,yay
13939,Great Historic events.

13943,like me do alot i have
13944,"It's a great game overall, at least with all the DLCs."
13945,"It got updated... 
Play Civ VI"
13946,classic builder.  just haven't made the jump to 6..
13947,This game is way too addictive for my own good
13948,"Pros:
* nice multiplayer strategy game
* plenty of settings options
* several optional win conditions, which allows for diverse play styles
* many nations to choose from, each of which have unique perks
* decent graphic style
* engaging game play that requires you to balance many variables and resources
* plenty of replayability

Cons:
* the bots can become really easy to beat after playing a bit"
13949,"Good game, would love mac lan compatibility with windows though"
13950,"Depends on whether you like the mechanics. Even so, this is still a great game. Appeal unmatched.
"
13951,one of the best 4x games on the market
13952,"The vanilla game is nice but I highly recommend at least the BNW and G and K espansions. Wait for a sale and buy the complete bundle with all the dlc s, it's worth it"
13953,.
13954,better than VI imo
13955,Good game
13956,Never gets old
13957,"fun, vry gud"
13958,best one so far.
13959,Dangerously Addicting. TONS of re-play value.
13960,The game is just fun
13961,Great fun
13962,"Four words: JUST. ONE. MORE. TURN.

If you have already played civilization games, this one is the best one IMHO. If you are new to the series, this is a great place to start. There are a few things that may be frustrating at times like not being able to stack units but they are few and dont take too much from the game at all. Things like diplomacy and city-states are the best out of all the civ games and the mods add so much to the game as well. The game is much better with the expansions but fortunately it isnt as exploited as much as civ VI is getting exploited. If you like 4X games this is a definite buy."
13963,"It's an impressive time waster, I love the style of play because it doesn't require your constant attention.. I hardly ever get mad while playing even at higher difficulties.. If you're on the fence about this version or Civ 6 I'd highly recommend this version.. they truly went out of the way to make 6 as frustrating as possible."
13964,"Tons of content, well balanced and fun to play."
13965,Better than 6
13966,Totally Awesome
13967,yes
13968,"The company decided spyware was okay, so I decided to not buy or play anything from them again."

13979,watt
13980,Good game.
13981,"It's a great game. Wait for a sale on all the content, and buy the complete package, because Brave New World is a great expansion, and that's the cheapest way to get it all."
13982, good
13983,ayyyy is k
13984,sid mier
13985,"one of my favorite RTS games of all time, offers great challenges. Smart thinking pays off in this game against real people or the AI. If you have a couple friends with this game skip Settlers of Catan and play this game instead. endless fun and each game is never like the last! 9/10"
13986,great game

13991,Simply perfect. 10/10.
13992,"Thank you Sid, very cool!"
13993,This game is a classic that you can play over and over again. User interface extremely easy to navigate.
13994,russia and greece are no more

 a blast"
14003,its okay i guess
14004,"I bounce between CivX games.

I've got the Brave New World expansion for this iteration and it's one of the best time killers. Replayability is a staple for this brand this game is no different.

Pick it up when it's marked down, fellow civ builder players, it's worth it even in 2020."
14005,.
14006,I love this game it is very fun but it does crash all the time and that piss me off so have fun
14007,One of the greatest strategy games ever! I love it :D
14008,good
14009,"very good, very fun, you can drop big bombs while the people u drop the big bombs on wear ur blue jeans"
14010,Big nuke go boom boom
14011,Incredible.  Addictive!
14012,good
14013,One of the best of all Civ games!
14014,"While each Civ game since 3 has had its rough edges removed, Some would argue those rough edges are what made the game so charming. Civ V is polished as all hell, and pretty simplified compared to its predecessor but still really addictive. Highly recommend this to newcomers since the tutorial and help feature are robust."
14015,Best game I own!
14016,*UPDATE* nahhh
14017,"Ok.  So I said ""yes"" indicating I like this game.   So now I have to come up with some random number of words about it."
14018,"So insanely fun and so much better than CIV 6. Got it free on Epic Games, hated it and bought CIV 5. Much better all around game.... just one... more... turn."
14019,I have played this game since its release and I keep playing it. It's just so good!
14020,The complete game (Including Brave New World DLC) is by far the better game of the franchise.
14021,good times.
14022,love this game
14023,gud game
14024,Amazing
14025,its aight
14026,Ok.
14027,Everything about this game is historically accurate right down to Gandhi having a nuclear trigger finger
14028,"Very good strategy game, a classic for sure, be careful though time will lose it's meaning when you're playing this game 7/10"
14029,"great game, favourite of krazd"
14030,first Civ game i've played.  Heckin love it
14031,If you  ever liked any version of Civ you'll definitely love this one!
14032,Brilliant game.
14033,"I like the chill but somewhat captivating gameplay. I can sit infront of my PC and play this game for hours, creating a world of my own. It's also funny how you make friends and enemies with the AI. I think so myself at least."
14034,Great strategy game.
14035,roam
14036,"good
"
14037,fun
14038,Absorbing if you like strategy games
14039,"Of course Civ 5 is interesting, enjoyable, rewarding, especially since recent upgrades to my Civ 6 have caused frequent crashes so I've played Civ 5, instead"
14040,"360 hours, nough said"
14041,Interactive gameplay
14042,depression incarnate
14043,"If your'e like me and wish you could visit other parts of human history and imagine the open and unexplored nature of the world before we put a McDonalds on every corner and spent all our time on digital entertainment cubes, I recommend.

True Civ V players only play until highways become a thing - everything beyond that is a mess."
14044,"Good game, keeps you addicted by seeing the satisfaction of watching your empire grow more powerful throughout the ages. Feels a bit skinner-boxy, but rising numbers still get my senses tingling!"
14045,"great game, very calming"
14046,You can spend 15 hours wondering why you're spending 15 hours making many numbers go up
14047,I love this game and this series.  This is by far my favorite of them all though.  Definitely worth the purchase.
14048,I gud
14049,good stuff
14050,"uh, where else can you drop gahdamn nukes on your friends?"
14051,"Easily the definitive edition of Sid Meier's Civilization, with the previous entry being a bit too unfriendly while the later entry being a bit too hollow and simplified, this is the Goldilocks zone of Civilization."
14052,digital heroine
14053,So many hours into this game. Great competition!
14054,Epic
14055,just a fun game of world domination with your buds
14056,good
14057,"amazing game

"
14058,good game
14059,I love it so much
14060,"This is a game that I never expected to stay a part of my life as long as it has. I've been playing this game since it was released, stopping for spells, and always picking it back up. I've played Beyond Earth and Civilization VI, but I always find myself coming back to this game. It's the perfect game to play while listening to a podcast, eating lunch, or listening to an audiobook. I don't think I will ever stop playing this game."
14061,Love dis ish
14062,A classic game of it's own genre.
14063,awesome
14064,Solid empire building classic
14065,Just one more turn...
14066,Civilization V is the most balanced game out of the series.
14067,"Played it once or twice, not bad I guess."
14068,"It plays like a board game. Just as fun single player as multi player, truly a great game"
14069,Well made game with lots of interesting dimensions and challenges. High replayability.
14070,I LIKE.
14071,Started playing 10 years ago and still trying to beat deity today
14072,ye it's not bad
14073,it kool and a time killer
14074,Still a noob but is pretty fun. Way better than civ 6. Buy it now
14075,Hands down my favourite CIV game. i think this is a game everyone should play at some point.
14076,My favorite war strategy game ever.  Very well balanced.
14077,I like that you can make city's and go to war
14078,The BEST game ever made.
14079,"""your trade route has been plundered"" Continues to destroy an entire tribe just incase they did it"
14080,The only game I've ever bothered with writing a review for. Civ V stands as the best strategy game I've ever played.
14081,"I liked the ability to choose governments, religion, trade partners and your research track."
14082,10/10 Wish they made Civ Vi like this one....
14083,Good game
14084,"Facinating game, BNW adds historical layers not normally seen in gaming."
14085,"really good game
"
14086,"Very fun, but easy to get lost in the sauce."
14087,It's a goodie!
14088,Some bugs on mac version when a capital is taken but otherwise a great strat game
14089,"really fun RTS game, i would definitely recommend this game to other RTS loving players"
14090,Really great game! Can't recommend enough.
14091,"I like civ 5 because it doesn't crash constantly like civ 6. Simple. I have only played civ 6 for about 50-60 hours but experience dozens of crashes. Civ 5 I've already played through 2x without a single crash.

Civ 5 all the way."
14092,"Simply amazing.
Never evr get tire3d of playing CIV5:)"
14093,"Game is classic. Good to play with friends unless they have a mac. Dont get this game if you have a mac. I dont so it's fun for me, not so much for my friend...."
14094,GREAT GAME!!!!!!!
14095,"its good
"
14096,i played this game for a long time but we are now in 2021 so just buy the VI
14097,"good game pretty easy to get into and fun
"
14098,"I've really liked the Civilization franchise for a while now, and this one is by far my favorite Civilization game."
14099,"I never thought I'd ever give a hoot about strategy games but then some ex let me play it and here I am, being Boudicca and killing Hitler. Again.

Civ V, which is not narrated by Leonard Nimoy (but my God I am so sure, every time I play it, that it is narrated by Leonard Nimoy) has a great soundtrack, interesting game progression and honestly, cute units. I love the little horse units. It's a great introduction into strategy games if you've never played them, and fun for casual history buffs. I recommend having the leader animations on if your computer can handle it and enabling the leaders to speak in their native languages. Also, spring for the game packs so you have more leaders to choose from - it makes the gameplay that much more interesting and you also get some other notable figures as specialized units as well. 

Pick it up if you're working from home and you want to play a game during the holiday office slump without actually *playing too much*. It's great for that."
14100,"You can spend dozens of hours playing each civilization available and there are 40+ of them.
The game is fully customizable, there is even a map creator.
Random map generation with options.
Music is different depending on your civilization. Often well suited and always well made (i'm a musician). It is enough to give the atmosphere and feel like you are playing as a specific civilization.
User interface is classical. The number of options in one single menu is never overwhelming. It is easy to handle for a 4x, once you figured out where to search for specific infos and options. Explanations are detailed enough to quickly understand how things work and how you can interact (hovering mouse over things helps a ton).
Online multiplayer, and HotSeat mode available.
Clever autosave system for single player.
Game works on linux and mac.

I have nothing to say but : Top-tier turn based strategy game.
A must have, at a cheap price (discounted)."
14101,lots of hours and never the same game. love the strategy!
14102,Its Awesome. no explanation needed
14103,Better than civ 6
14104,Fuck Gandhi
14105,"good game
"
14106,cool
14107,a
14108,I said one more turn 10 hours ago.
14109,"Fun. Never gets old because there is always a new angle to try. Whether your into Technology, Culture, war, Money, or Diplomacy; This game has many ways to play and finding your own balance is the fun part. they have many mods available in the workshop as well that can add or remove features to make it more fiction or non fiction.  A great game for anybody into history or fantasizes about the future on our planet.

+Turn based
+good graphics for this style game
+easy to run and doesn't crash
+concepts are amazing

-You can build space ships but cannot leave the planet
-AI tends to go to war easily
-AI doesn't trade fairly
-you cannot stack or combine units to siege and gain strength.
-a ww2 bomber can take damage from pikeman... ya I don't understand that.


"
14110,def not better than the board game imo
14111,Civ 5 is the best Civ game. I really like it.
14112,"Like:
-Everything
Dislike:
-Gandhi with Nukes

If you like turn-based strategy games, just buy this one. One of the best on the market!"
14113,Not Civ 6 10/10 would play again.
14114,nice
14115,It's pretty lit
14116,Help
14117,"The historic relevance is exemplified within this fantastical approach to war. Strategically, brutally, or spiritually dominate your enemies in this immersive thriller."
14118,Huge depth and value in this game. Endless challenge and replayability.
14119,Best turn-based strategy game series!
14120,.
14121,good game. brings lots of memeros back
14122,stack over flow error caused ghandi to drop nuclear weapons on my peaceful civilisation. i cried.
14123,Fun but at times it takes too long to move along.
14124,I never really played many strategy games except for Starcraft 2 and the Advance Wars Games. But this game is insanely addictive and satisfying consistently. Truly can make hours just evaporate
14125,i have i play  1198 hor
14126,Game takes ALOT of time but I love it
14127,My favourite game. Ever.
14128,"""You've played for 398 hours - would you recommend this game to other players?"" is a tougher question than you'd think."
14129,Its very clever and worryingly addictive
14130,An updated old classic that we used to play years ago.
14131,I've poured hundreds of hours into this game. So much fun to just sit down and conquer the world.
14132,good
14133,This game has so many options for scenarios
14134,Good game I like being a war criminal
14135,I feel like I've barely played this game even at several-hundred hours.
14136,"Do you like having your opponents sweep victories out from under you after 7 hours of gameplay, if so buy it on discount w Brave New World."
14137,"увлекательная игра, требующая тщательного обдумывания действий"
14138,Amazing game to play with friends when they aren't stabbing you in the  back.
14139,`1
14140,"Good game, nuking other countries is fun

"
14141,is good
14142,Really fun way to pass time
14143,great game! fun and intuitive.
14144,Probably the best game of all time ngl
14145,"- кривой интерфейс
 - кривой мультиплеер
 - куча багов"
14146,epic. Thats it.
14147,Great game!
14148,"This game was never finished fully, it needs some rebalancing and work, but fuck if it isn't at least balanced enough to be a damn good time! I recommend some mods for improvement the community has produced some great stuff."
14149,Better than civ 6 by leagues
14150,I am very bad at this game and it is probably my favorite game of all time.
14151,"Incredibly one sided, AI is significantly more powerful has better range and is boringly one sided. Don't bother purchasing this pointless game.
"
14152,reeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee
14153,Good strategy game.
14154,"better than 6
"
14155,goodgame
14156,"This is one of my all-time favorite games, and while the AI can often behave in infuriating and baffling ways, I would highly recommend. It's amazingly intuitive, features beautiful graphics, and is fun to play long-distance with friends. Add to that a dynamic modding community in the Steam Workshop and the replayability is unparalleled. Civ 5 kept me sane through this loooong pandemic year spent mostly inside. 10/10

My one real criticism is that playing for certain victory types can be overly reliant on events that are sometimes out of your control. I almost always play for Cultural Victories, and the path is *very* narrow a lot of the time. For instance, if the AI triggers the International Games too early before anyone has really had a chance to build up tourism, the endgame because a pretty tedious slog while you wait for your Great Musicians to craaaawl across the map toward your closest cultural competitors. But that hasn't stopped me from logging 775+ hours in-game, so clearly it's not a dealbreaker. ;)"
14157,Pretty good.
14158,"Bought Civ 6 but gotta say, I keep coming back to play this version. Be warned, you will lose many hours to ""Just one more turn..."""
14159,10/10  Would get wrecked by Ghandi again
14160,It's alright
14161,"On the easier levels you can simply make war and take over the world, but as you learn more and more you have the opportunity to win through, science, culture, or diplomacy. Religion also adds a very interesting element that at first I was not a fan of but it just opens more avenues, makes normally unusable territory strong for settling. Overall this is one of the most fun games I have every played. I have nearly 2000 hours into and I have not even achieved victory on Diety difficulty yet."
14162,"so this game actually tells a lot about our society.
we live in a society.
so i will keep this short. i dont have a lot of time left on this planet."
14163,Liked the game. But it kept crashing on MacOS. Now it works.
14164,I've played for 1000 hours. What else to say?
14165,great game
14166,its ok
14167,So much cheaper and better than Civ 6
14168,"I still say I'd recommend this game. You'll enjoy it a lot if you love turn-based strategies in general. It offers almost infinite replayability, especially if you join the multiplayer. But, there are some problems:
1) some graphic bugs (at least on Linux): for example, if you scroll to zoom in, you'll see blury texture, and then a proper texture will loading in a couple of seconds (which is weird, given that I have an RX570 with 4 gigs of RAM; should be plenty to load everything);
2) Pretty dumb AI which is incapable of fighting; after you play several games, you'll be able to easily beat with 2-3 times smaller army. Also, if you increase the difficulty level, the AI does not become smarter; it just starts cheating(gets more gold, faster building speed, etc.). So, it's much more fun to play with real humans.
3) During late game, turns become very long, as you have to move endless units and build endless buildings, just get boring pretty easily. That's why I like playing for Venice (as Venice is not allowed to own any other cities other than Venice)."
14169,"Great game. Absolutely love it. Sure it doesn't have many features that Civ 6 has, but for some reason I enjoy this more"
14170,Its good
14171,"Super detailed game, almost educational.  Very long play time though."
14172,Fantastic for both single and multiplayer.
14173,pog
14174,Great game!
14175,"I have had too much fun playing this game. I got into the Civ series on Playstation 3 with Sid Meiers Civilization Revolution. Its the reason I still have a PS3, that and P.T.O. IV. Nonetheless I remember my first time playing this, it was intimidating compared to Civ Rev. But after countless hours playing and plenty of Filthy Robot videos later, I felt as if I became an expert by being able to create unique situations against the A.I. to create a pathway to victory. This is the Epitome of Civ, and definitely amazing. Pick this up, and see if your Civ can stand the test of time!!"
14176,"aztec
"
14177,Just get this already!
14178,"great game a lot of replay value
"
14179,k
14180,"Turns the slow march towards death into a ""quick, just one more turn, wait, where'd the last 200 hrs go"", towards death."
14181,.
14182,It's a sort of game I personally like. Of course civ VI is out now making  this obsolete but its still a blast to hop onto a private game with friends and waste your life for several hours on a single match
14183,Gustavus Adolphus lives to suffer.
14184,fun to play offline and online
14185,Amazingly replayable and the strategy is so complex that is never gets boring. Buy this over Civ 6.
14186,it awesome
14187,Good civ game
14188,it is a very good game
14189,"fajna

14190,I Like It
14191,Great to play with friends.
14192,11/9 would play one more turn
14193,"Buy this game. Install it. Start playing it.

Boom! Your social life is gone.

Congratulations. At least remember to shower every now and then"
14194,Recommend this to Civ VI as the franchise went in the wrong direction. Mostly in in visuals (too cartoony) and game pace
14195,"N O,  D O N' T...  J U S T   D O N' T. 🙃"
14196,I like to play a quick game for 2 hours when I have a break from work.
14197,"Become best friends with ghandi, thats all you need"
14198,Many ways you can win in this game and 400+ hrs is not enough to try ehm all :)
14199,"This is the best Civ there is. That's it, that's the review."
14200,"Best CIV game ever from Sid Meier!  Well worth the money spent, and all the DLCs work great.  No need to get CIV 6, this is WAY better!"
14201,One... more... turn...
14202,"better then Civ 6, could be excellent but I miss unit stacking from Civ 4 :( and I still remember problems at the beginning (2 year beginning...) when we had a lot of problems with this game."
14203,"Amazing game, have had it for 3 years. Never seems to get old and combined with mods is an amazing expirence. People who don't like spending hours on a single game, however, will proabably not enjoy this game."
14204,Civ IV is the Goldilocks version Civ III had the best game play but Civ V has better graphics.  Still Civ V is well worth it.  I'd like it better if the brought back stacked units.

14206,"Raise your military's might, war with any and all nations, nuke everyone who opposes you, annex every country in sight and take there resources. Rinse and repeat until you're the god emperor of the world...or just progress your country's science and culture and have a peaceful existence. You do you nobody's going to judge your war crimes against humanity. 10/10 best mix of city builder and strategy game out to date. Overly addictive."
14207,ayyyyyyyyy
14208,Good and diverse.  Graphics good without being to busy.  Lots of different set ups.  Difficulty from easy to very very hard to beat.  Immortal is insane.  Can only beat the game with three of the characters so far.  Surprisingly one of them is Napoleon.
14209,"Overall, this game is 10/10. This title truly lives up to the Sid Meier's Civilization legacy. Firaxis has truly outdone themselves with this game.

Gameplay:

As a fan of turn-based strategy, this game is very appealing to me. With a plethora of civilizations to play as, each with their own unique units, buildings, and abilities, Civ V offers an extreme amount of replayability. There's five different ways to achieve victory with any civilization, 3 different ideologies to adopt, and various cultural trees to explore. With the inclusion of the Steam Workshop, mods bring an endless array of fun, realism, and new civilizations to play as.

Music:

The music is incredibly relaxing and pleasant to listen to. Each civilization has music to match their cultural theme, and the music changes based on your actions in the game (the music changes to be more dramatic during wars, for example). The music is overall pleasing and doesn't leave me wanting more."
14210,"i played civ 6 one time and i still like 5 better
"
14211,For me one of the best strategical game!!!
14212,Better than 6
14213,This game is very nice!
14214,"Started a game, friend's first time with brave new world. Two hours go by an all is great, one of us is Russia, one is England and I were Venice. My mate playing Russia finishes the liberty tree but the game bugs so the button is doing nothing. The next half hour was an utter sh** show of him leaving and joining over and over getting saltier each time. After all of this, the great person selection was still bugged so he left permanently. Bloody AI replaces him and builds a terracota army, it doubled his military might from one spearman to two. Lmao, 10/10, can wait to watch the AI fu** up again."
14215,"Just three turns shy of an amazing scientific victory on Emperor, I accidentally nicked a continental ally with an atomic bomb and was bulldozed in two turns. 10/10 would waste another day again."
14216,The best Civilization ever make!
14217,"I'm 100% biased since I grew up with this game 
but GODDAMN this game is good.
the countless hours that I spent frusturated at greeks city states turned out to be more engaging and fun than I expected"
14218,"Great strategy game. Games can last forever, which is exactly what I wanted."
14219,"As a History Major and a student taking a class on the Decline and Fall of Complex Society, I can tell you with 100% honesty that CiV emulates history and all of the classes I have taken in history very well. And allow me to tell you how
You are constantly at odds with filthy barbarians just like the Chinese or any European civilization from back in the olden days. It is because of this did I realize the reason for why Barbarians are so hated as they will invade your civilization and take everything from you much like the Britain when it comes to China and getting their people on opium.
If you play with your friends and there are NPCs, the NPCs much like any civilization will act nice to you and then backstab you with no real rhyme or reason except that your military looks pitiful to them. But if you decide to complete kill the invader you are now a warmonger and everyone will be sacred or extremely pissed at you because you were defending yourself.
If you play with just your friends prepared to do some mental gymnastics and playing some 4D Chess as you have to decide whether not to invade your friend because they have something you want or you because they settled too close to your civilization and you just go ""fuck it, this is the first and final straw. Prepare to meet your demise."" Thus making your friend upset and you upset because you now must kill your friend because if you don't kill him someone else will or they might just come back and kill you because of some of your ancestors decided to destroy some farms 100s of years ago.
If you are a History Major you might do good in the or mediocre as you make all of the wrong decisions like some past rulers thus ending in you being ranked as bad as Nero Cladius; but it be like that because Nero Cladius is fucking hot and thicc. 
I give the game a 10/10 as I fully regret buying the game spending 200+ hours on it."
14220,Its uh ... ok I guess.
14221,"The game where I have spent the most hours in a single session.
I'm not that much into turned based strategy games, nor have I played CIV V's expansions yet, so take it as you will."
14222,Just one more turn...
14223,cool
14224,"ADDICTING, so many ways to play. 10/10 would play more"
14225,Its so fun but very addicting
14226,good gaem
14227,"While the game is highly sanitized play, it is a fun challenge with a lot of variety to play styles."
14228,yeah it's alright
14229,It's really fun
14230,"love game its like a puzzle but well more active than one
"
14231,Love it
14232,It still owns
14233,"Solid game: Easy to play, lots of content, good fun, and cheap on sale."
14234,"its fun for like... airports
"
14235,too addictive..
14236,Fun and good strategy game. Because there are 4 ways to achieve a victory you can make every game different. Also there are lots of different leaders and maps to make it even more fun and interesting to play.
14237,Its a pretty fun game to play. It is more fun when you got a few friends to play with but if you like playing alone it will be fun for you aswell.
14238,Very good
14239,the best civi so far
14240,Best game on steam
14241,"I played this game and hated it the first 2 times, but fell in love on the 3rd. lots going on but fun"
14242,"Still the best Civ game, if I could only own 1 game it would be this one"
14243,kjdfgkjdgljdgloijn
14244,yup
14245,A Classic.
14246,"Like to build empire

Learned that world is hexagonal"
14247,The best civ overall imo
14248,"its alright i suppose, I played it a little bit."
14249,i would recommed this whole series.
14250,"Top 3 games in existence.
 
"
14251,fun game...makes you really use your brain.
14252,
14253,games alright
14254,gandhi go boom
14255,This game allows you to play as your favorite warlord: Mahatma Gandhi
14256,Good and addictive game. The rich range of mods never bores me.
14257,good
14258,great game I've played over 4000 hours!
14259,"Since February 2020, i have missmatch issue (cross-platform) that block us to play (local and internet)
Anyone has the same? Or tips?"
14260,Meowington has 1400 hours in this game and would still probably lose to my 20 hours.
14261,mt bom
14262,"The first hours of the game-romance! A huge world, cows graze, cities grow, Alexander the great on horseback for the first time visits your property and speaks Greek. There are religions that start and end a centuries-old war.
But even when the game is studied up and down, it does not stop. ""Civilization"" takes on a new, chess-mathematical connotation. How to overcome artificial intelligence at the highest level? Which tactics are more profitable in terms of numbers and demographics? The playing field is divided by a grid of hexes, a hill - 2 hammers, a river - one coin, cows-three apples, in the future + a hammer and a good chance to build a great library by the 23rd turn, if there are forests around for cutting... This is what the ""civa"" looks like after a couple of hundred hours of play: even the starting position already determines the tactics. But, sooner or later, you get tired of this side of the game.
And then what? Next, multiplayer, and that's where the real civilization begins!
Multi-dimensional, infinitely interesting, my favorite game. I advise everyone to play."
14263,"This game is very entertaining. If you stick to the same game settings each time, then it can get quite repetitive. However, if you keep mixing things up, no two game will ever be the same. I fully recommend getting the DLC's as it just adds an extra element to the game."
14264,Good Game. I never get bored.
14265,Love it.
14266,"Excellent gameplay, more options than I can possibly work through, but I'll try!"
14267,best game of its kind
14268,"It's a game. I've played other games, but this one, well, it's a game. And when I say it's a game, believe me, it's a game. Also, Ghandi is an asshole. In this game. Otherwise, yay Ghandi."
14269,"Give me a mod where I can tell other civilizations to piss off and stop spreading their fucking religion to me and I shall declare this game to be perfect.

Anytime a civ tells me to 'stop spreading near their borders' or whatever - I'm just like ""Where's the option to say 'you did it first motherfucker!'"
14270,good with friends
14271,itz iight xd
14272,I love it!
14273,what to say?...    ...This is bluntly just a great game!
14274,Sid Meier's Civilization is hands down the best strategy game ever developed! I have been playg this game since i was a teenager startg with Civ II on the original playstation!!! Have to say tho the gameplay on Civ V is awesome and the graphics are kick a**!! Cant wait to play Civ VI!!
14275,great game. would buy again.
14276,"great game, amazing replay-ability. Definitely would recommend."
14277,"Forcefully conquering the world seemed like a great way to relieve stress.

It definitely was. 

10/10 Domination Victory

Many options to ensure your nations victory."
14278,ITS FUN
14279,"After 2k launcher update game is no longer launching. Literally, game is broke."
14280,shit game so boring lol. DONT BUY
14281,This game has so much historical depth! I really enjoy every play through. You have the ability to change the difficulty before you start the game as well as who you play as. The Brave New world Expansion is absolutely awesome! Get this game!
14282,Lotsa fun
14283,Huge CIVS fan
14284,"It offers some completely new strategies compared to Civ 4, but it lacks the great mods like RFC Dawn of Civilization and Realism Invictus, that made me love Civ 4. Yet it's much better digestable for history/world simulator fan than the Civ 6, which is quite horrible in my opinion."
14285,"Love it.
"
14286,It's okay.
14287,gud game
14288,The lack of stability in Multiplayer is the only problem I've seen with the game
14289,Looks better than civ 6!
14290,"Of ALL the versions of Civilization Civ5 remains my favorite because of both it's complexity and it's simplicity.  To me all the later versions fell into the trap of ""more is better"" and flashy graphics."
14291,"Oh i just love how chill it is for a strategy game, obviously i really just enjoy the mechanics and everything. Honestly the only thing i ever complain about the game is the crappy job they did creating the multiplayer and the fact that you cant even use mods while playing online, that alone would help this games replayability soooooo much."
14292,if you love  games that take srategy games then get this game. you can win the game with war or with peace
14293,"Possibly one of the most epic games I've played. I have so much time in it and I have only completed one game in total. Greatly recommend
"
14294,"I have played this game for awhile and i enjoy it so much. The DLC Adds so much content to the game and if you still want more content then there is workshop support for the game that is still active. Also the game is easy to run on Low-end hardware , so that is always a plus. While the cross-platform needs to be patched to work, reverting to an older version of the game can fix that.
"
14295,Need something to scratch your global domination bug this is it.
14296,Still better than civilization 6.
14297,its good
14298,Losing
14299,Best turn-based Strategy game to have ever been made.
14300,Just one more turn
14301,no
14302,The art of war and debait.
14303,hi
14304,Plays well on older Mac laptop
14305,Im forced to play this by a rude australian but otherwise is a good game
14306,I enjoy the long term & big picture aspects of this Strategy game.
14307,This is a great addition to the Civ franchise.  Very modable & lots of variety.  I've never gotten so tired of it I put t down forever.
14308,its very well done
14309,"its GUUD GAME
"
14310,.
14311,"This would be awesome if you could opt out of the religious research and not have to deal with trespassing clerics. otherwise it's Civ ina new improved package, so if like Civ 3 you'll be ok this."
14312,great game.
14313,"Its lovely really.  If you like anything by Paradox this will feel like a children's toy - but thats ok - its fun and doesnt require a degree to play it.  

I feel like I have undersold it. Its a great game. Play it!"
14314,It's alright I guess...
14315,its aight
14316,Awesome
14317,"8/10 would be 9/10 or 9.5/10 if it didn't have the ""civilization"" name.

It's a good 4x game, lots of mods with the only glaring flaw being it's name[1].

[1] It's too divergent from Civ 3-4, nevermind 2 to really count. Hey, beats being Civ 6."
14318,"This game is perfect. Multiple tales of peace, war, and getting nuked as soon as yoUR FRIEND COMPLETES THE MANHATTAN PROJECT! ARE YOU HAPPY JASON?' ARE YOU HAPPY WITH YOURSELF?!?"
14319,fun
14320,"very fast and fun, I define most strategy games by this one."
14321,Good.
14322,Buy this game
14323,love the game because you cant bet it in 3 min it takes a lot of think a stratgey
14324,The best civ game to come out!!!!
14325,"I have played civ 5 for most of the last six years. It still is a very good and fun game, and I actually prefer this version over the sixth installment of the game. I only do single player or closed multiplayer with friends. 

This is one game i can recommend to any friend. 
Come to the 4x side, we have cookies... and maybe just play one more turn"
14326,Pretty good
14327,Awesome!
14328,Better than  VI IMO.
14329,Just...one...more...turn!
14330,"The definitive civ experience
"
14331,"Your giant robots hold the coast.
Your cruisers sail the seas.
Your soldiers wait at every post,
And bombers fly the breeze.

Your wonders stand in every space.
Your savings surge in stores.
Your cities grow in every place,
And all the land is yours.

Your map's the hue and shade of you.
You're watching Gandhi burn.
There's nothing left for you to do.

You whisper: ""one more turn..."""
14332,very gas
14333,Gas
14334,This is the best of the Civilization Series.  Don't waste your time with 6.
14335,hn
14336,"because its a good game
"
14337,Burnt many hours conquering the world. Possibly years. A must have for 4X fans.
14338,"A lot of people love this game and series so I decided to try it out. I will admit that it is addicting. If you start out with good luxury resources on a coast, then you will do reasonably well. If not, restart until you do. Then, spend several turns just trying to learn about your surroundings because building in the first few turns is meant to waste as many turns as possible. Then,, based on standard game, you will start advancing your civilization and that is where the addicting part comes in.

There is a wide variety of directions you can go but you will quickly realize that you are in a competition with other civilizations to build wonders first, and in order to do so you will be forced into the same boring build orders that every RPG/Strategy game uses these days and straying from the build orders at all means you lose. 

Seemingly minor decisions one turn can cause your whole civilization to riot in the following turn.

Further, there is a time limit to succeed based on the settings you chose and unless you specialized in something, you won't win. There are a wide variety of winning  possibilities but what you will quickly find is that if you 'wasted' your time trying to learn everything you will have succeeded at nothing.

Lastly, the game is clearly made by doe eyed liberals. Everything is centered around the city (liberals believe cities to be the pinnacle of human civilizaiton due to their obsession with shoving people of different backgrounds together and expecting harmony). Conquest is almost actively discouraged while 'working together towards a better future' quickly becomes the goal. The sixth game takes this even further by introducing global warming. All your progress will be halted by it. Combat is downright boring and has low rewards: new cities gained mean more unrest and rewards from conquest take time to materialize.

All in all, the game is addicting. That is its only upside."
14339,The best game ever!
14340,This version of Civilization keeps the true tradition of past Civ games and has even been able to replace my play of Civ. II; the previous best version. I also have Civ VI but me and my kids prefer this version as the movement of troops is more to our liking.  My son also likes the larger group representing his troops. Civ V has plenty of variables and systems to keep you busy developing you civilization as well.
14341,excellent strategy game. Crack for geeks
14342,"Good Game, but it's got a bit of a dodgey community. Best stick to Single Player or play with friends."
14343,shaka zulu and his dang impi rush!!!!!
14344,GOAT
14345,fun yes
14346,"best game in the series, if you play an ocean based map as the english, good luck to the other civs"

14352,The best 4x game there is
14353,fuck sweden and japan
14354,Another exceptional installment to the saga.  Buy it!
14355,Great game play for a casual game. I have played it since it was new and I am still playing it to pass the time.

14357,A classic. Still a goodie.
14358,Best Game. Try it out
14359,Many hours downtime enjoying this game.
14360,excellent time killer
14361,fun game and also  idk this is a good game simple basic and just kill them all just make sure they have airpods in before you attack them

14365,Its very realistic
14366,i played this game for 33 hours with no rest and havent stopped. Help.
14367,simply amazing
14368,Simple. I've played this game for more hours than I have any other game.
14369,CIV5 is like a drug... once you start it's HARD to stop... you've been warned.... that being said IT'S WORTH IT.
14370,Love it
14371,good
14372,"classic game

14373,Real strategy game..need to think before act..so you can win..To found the perfect balance between gold..science..culture....takes time..You gonna loose 100 times before winning once..
14374,Love the game. Good for multiplayer matches. Tends to keep you playing late hours.
14375,ere
14376," I dont play multiplayer, so this review is only about single mode. I really like Civ games and especially Civ 5, its very addicting, has a lot of mechanics, allows different strategies and tactics. Im not a pro player, but after game or  two it became quite easy on lvl 5-6. I tried to switch to higher difficulty level and got frustrated:
1. AI basically cheating, it has more science, production, culture, gold no matter what.
2. From military aspect of view, AI is super dumb on any level of difficulty, it doesnt know how to use them properly, therefore you dont need a big army to be able to win fights without loosing. But on lvl 7-8, AI has enormous amount of units and gold, and it just becoming super annoying and dull it just takes a lot of time to fight stupid AI units, it doesnt use any tactics just rushing or defending with everything he has.
3. Happens mechanics doesnt apply on AI, he doesnt suffer from it and basically gives no limits for AI. On the same time on Higher difficulties especially, you cant declare war or enlarge your empire because of it. its super annoying when you finally wiped all enemies units but cant take his city because you will get - 10 happiness , and you will basically lose more time and resources without gaining something back.
4. Because of everything above, on higher difficulties you will have to play by specific  tactic and strategy, your hands will be more tied, there wont be such freedom of choice as on lower difficulties, for every mistake you will be punished hard, and because its a strategy game the punishment can last for a long time killing all the desire.

Once again im not a pro player but I've tried hard to win on lvl 7 bunch of times and every time i just got frustrated. its not fun to play against stupid but cheating AI. But I still had a lot of fun on lower difficulties but as I said eventually it becomes boring. So overall I think as a strategy offline game, Civ 5 is not worth its money. I would suggest  to buy on sale or if you have friends who into that game and play with them."
14377,"This game is a classic.
HiDPI support for modern hires displays would be nice though."
14378,You're gonna look at the clock and way more hours will have passed than you thought
14379,play it it way better that Civ 6 in most part
14380,enjoyable game with great re-playability.
14381,.
14382,"I have been playing the Civilization series since the first game. As each new one in the series came out, I found it easy to change my playing style to meet the new features and goals. I have tried version VI, but found it a little too different for my playing enjoyment so have stuck with V. I do plan to give it another try at some point, but for now I am happy with V."
14383,It's fun
14384,Solid
14385,great
14386,Civilization V never gets old.  It provides a thrilling strategic experience.
14387,"It's Civ, it's amazing, y'all know this!"
14388,I hate Augustus and Alexander
14389,"fantastic game, immersive, addicting, fun, thoughtful"
14390,Supaez
14391,"Just an all time classic, better with friends"
14392,Still better than Civ 6
14393,Are we having fun yet?
14394,Should you buy Civ 5? The answer is YES if you don't already have it. Civ 5 is the best one of all civs at the moment and is prefect when you have alot of time and don't know what to do =)
14395,"Not quite as good as Civ 4 or Civ:BE but still a robust one-more-turn civ game.
The voice actor isn't as good as the aformentioned games and the humour that replaces the stoicism falls flat.
Its still fairly easy to outpace the AI and the game NEEDS the Brave new world expansion to be really playable.
The Religion system is tacked on and the diplomacy is very dumbed down."
14396,It's alright
14397,"Over 3k hours played. Will play more. Yes, I have 6. no, I dont care."
14398,Good one-way time machine.
14399,oh yeah. real fun to commit genocide
14400,The game has a great play value.
14401,Truly an amazing game. It is quite relaxing and fun playing.
14402,Amazing game and very addicting!
14403,Ive only played for a few hours. Game seems alright
14404,I'm not qualified to place this above or below other turn based strategy games. But I know a good game when I see one. And if you are seeing this you know how good the game is already.
14405," i loved it
"
14406,"112 hours. Yeah, I'd say this game rocks."
14407,Historee good. Good game.
14408,one more turn..............................
14409,I like it.
14410,"Great tactics and strategy, FFAs are the best part"
14411,It's fun... I don't know what else to say.
14412,Super game you can lose yourself for hours
14413,currently the best Civ game.
14414,Great
14415,Great game if  you like grand strategy games
14416,good
14417,yes
14418,Great Game!
14419,is good game. better than crappy Civ 6.
14420,"For me, this is the definition of 4X games. Everything in this game is so well done and executed, that apart from some problems that stem from the age of the game - there is nothing I have to complain about.

To understand this review fully - I'll need to preface this review with some information. I wasn't a 4X strategy person, I enjoyed chess a lot - but 4X? No. This game single-handedly got me addicted to the genre. People say ""One more turn."" for a reason - this game is extremely addicting, and even when you go in with zero knowledge - the game pulls you in, and doesn't let go. I'm not a strong player, in fact, I am extremely bad at this game, I don't play multiplayer, but the mechanics of this game keep me entertained for hours and hours on end. I haven't scratched the surface of the game in my 112 hours of playtime - but still, just building a strong economy and beating down the AI gives me immense pleasure.

I shouldn't like this game - I really shouldn't! I hate games that drag on, I dislike the higher level of ""strategy"" games (as in, grand(er) strategy), I hate games that are slower paced, I like action every second - and I really hate turns. So why do I like this game? I wish I could answer that question, but it's just a testament to how amazing this game is, for me (a person that tends to stay away from strategy games) - to like it.

I'm sorry if you - the reader, expected an analysis of the gameplay. But I really thinks that's not the greatest way to approach this game, since on paper - I wouldn't like this game - but it's casual enough, with enough depth - for me to have a lot of fun just messing about and spamming the end turn button.

Well - at least, that is my experience with it."
14421,Its the best Civ I've played....
14422,"Intriguing  Good games of skill and startegy

14423,"Civilisation 6 has bad and clunky gameplay and is difficult to win. Civilisation 5 is extremely difficult to play strategically, and is therefore difficult to win. Civilisation 5 is the better game, by far!"

14433,Best turn based strategy ganme there is
14434,Great game!
14435,"Its a fun, slow paced game perfect for those who just want to crush their enemies and grind them under their boot heel."
14436,yes
14437,"Fun, interesting, addictive! You can play fast and hard or play the same game for months by micromanaging every aspect of your civ. If you like strategy or 4X games then you'll obviously love this."
14438,terrible game
14439,"Haha very cool, check it out!"
14440,I freaking love this game.it is by far one of the best games when it comes to turn based strategy
14441,"If you liked Civ 1-4, Civ 5 is a further improved version!"
14442,"good games until you get to the Holy Man, I wish you well on that one!"
14443,its ok i guess
14444,;
14445,"civ 5 is classic
"
14446,graphics are that of an old 90s game trying to have good 3d graphics
14447,"horrible
"
14448,love it
14449,It is a great game i loved it it takes a while to get to use to all the mechanics but overall great
14450,Lots of contents
14451,its okay
14452,It was very addictive and was very interesting to play
14453,Its Sid Meier.. lol
14454,I mean its civ 5 its one of the best games of all time
14455,cool
14456,no
14457,"Fun game, easy to learn hard to master. lots of fun with friends."
14458,It's Civ. Just play it.
14459,"So fun game, very accurate, 100% recommend."
14460,"fun , but eat alot of time"
14461,its dope
14462,Civ5 is my favorite of all the Civ games. Endless fun and great strategy game.
14463,The Greatest Civilization Building game ever.
14464,"Excellent game that got better with each expansion, so definitely look for a bundle. 

however, since June it randomly freezes midgame on my Macbook, requiring me to force quit. I meet all specs. No answer has been found yet, so beware, Mac users."
14465,good
14466,"One of the greats. 

In my opinion Civ V is the best Civ game. I've put 72 hours into Civ VI with the expansions. It is a very different game and good in it's own ways but Civ V is love."
14467,One of the best tbs game ive ever seen. I strongly recommend it.
14468,good
14469,"Love Civ 5. Lots of variations, can play over and over. Distracts me from anxieties of living in this strange time. Highly recommend."
14470,Come on. Rule the world.
14471,"captivating and engaging experience, will immerse you more than most games you have played, historical accuracy is pleasing."
14472,this is the best in the series 6 liitle bit of a fail but 5 is just perfect
14473,Classic
14474,One of the most addictive strategy games I've ever played. Coming from someone who never plays strategy games; I highly recommend this game to anyone.
14475,i hate this game so much
14476,its ok
14477,"I have spent to much time on this game. So many blood, sweat and tears. Amazing game, but if you don't want to be consumed and spend all of your time on it then save yourself the money. I'm currently playing as your reading this."
14478,"I like strategy games n I like this game, and my friends who don't usually like strategy games also like this game."
14479,OMT
14480,"TLDR; Do I recomment this? Yes. 8@10, perhaps 9@10. Would be a 10 if with better music and voiceover tbh.

Long version: 

I've played all the Civ games since I was a kid, playing it cracked on my moms 40 mhz 386. Those were the days. I obviously didn't know it was cracked, but later in life, thinking about how I could purchase every unit for free made me think something must've been up. . 

Anyway, fast forward to today where I've spent over 3k hours in this game, and rarely ever idled, heck, even if I idled for 100 hours that wouldn't budge the number much. With workshop content and other mods like Enhanched User Interface and TEKmod, this game is just so replayable!

The downsides of Civ 5 is that it doesn't have as epic music as Civ 4 and Civ 6 and doesn't have neither Leonard Nimoy nor Sean Bean doing the quotes when a new tech is researched. This game also lacks corporations. To be frank, I rarely even remember corporations from Civ 4, but but I did feel they added to the game, but instead of that Civ 5 has tourism, which is definitely a stapled on feature that wasn't initially planned, and plays as such."
14481,Do not purchase this game if you have a Mac and have any desire to play with anyone who doesn't have a Mac. Cross-platform play was taken away last year.
14482,Love it.
14483,"This game is keeping me from playing anything else that's how good it is.  First CIV game, tried Alpha Centauri and Civ 6 but this is just perfect."
14484,reeeeeeeeeeee
14485,"Its a well rounded game with a lot of diverse features. For 2010, this game is still quite good."
14486,Still a fun game alone or with friends. Just couldn't get into Civ 6 and Civ 5 mods appear more powerful in their flexibility.
14487,IT WAS GOOD
14488,awsome
14489,Obviously this game is great.
14490,"Civ 5 looks great and works well, but there is a long stnding bug that 2k never got around too that basically stops the  game in its tracks, later in the game when you have multiple workers out doing job they will suddenly stop what they are doing and will require new orders on every turn. when you have lots of workers around this is time consuming and frustrating.

So be aware."
14491,"veru gut

14492,HBSWRDGFVSRFDGVSVX
14493,yes
14494,this game is pretty great. i love playing it at base with some friends online or modded to shit alone. both experiences while quite different are equally fun to me and i would highly recommend this game.
14495,Better than Civ 6

14499,It's a great game if you got multiple exam papers due

14501,too many egyptian warlords in my game
14502,It works
14503,Yeah it's not bad.
14504,"I love this game, only downside i could think of is that there is no counter nuke tech like civ4 had. I have tons of fun playing this game while hours carelessly fly by."
14505,Civ 5...what else is there to say?
14506,"Game is tons of fun with a variety of difficulties, playable civilizations, maps, and rulesets."
14507,ITS COOL N SHIT
14508,I like taking over the world.
14509,literal crack
14510,DIS GAME IS AMAZING IT RUINED MY LFE BUT IT WAS WORTH IT!!!
14511,10 years old and still goes strong. Bought civ 6 and refunded it in 10 minutes. Civ 5 OG
14512,What a wonderful game. I play this over and over and no two instances are the same
14513,Vastly better than Civ 6. Just buy this one when its on sale and enjoy your 3000+ hours of content.
14514,Multiplayer is simply broken

14517,"if you've never played civilization games, it's a slow build. the beginning is kinda boring. then you find some stuff and the game gets slightly more interesting. then you figure out what you're doing and the game is slightly more interesting. then you start building your empire and it's just barely interesting enough to keep you playing. over and over again. then you realize it's been 4 days."
14518,"Engrossing. Can play forever without ""winning"" if you want to."

14520,Amazing strategy game.
14521,is good

14523,"If this game could be a waifu, I'll be a shut in"
14524,very nice strategy game. It's turn based so if you're playing alone you can play at your own pace.
14525,Playing Venice is this game is the closest I'll ever get to economic stability. 10/10

14536,"Civilization V is the single best game i have ever played.  It is fun, well balance, and incredibly educational.  Also, they did an excellent job incorporating easy-to-download and easy-to-integrate external content into the game, making for the ability to constant change the gameplay experience."
14537,good... very good.
14538,"I've been playing these games since my teen years and I absolutely love them! You get to play as (mostly) accurate depictions of historical leaders - from Gandhi to Bismark, you must use your wits and strategy to dominate other world leaders. Brute strength is not the only way to win - you can dominate through several different types of strategies: Diplomacy, Science and Culture (my favorite). If you enjoy strategy games, I highly recommend this!"
14539,"Yeah, it's pretty good."
14540,"it is very good
"
14541,"I have played all version of this intriguing game since the original.  While i like some version better than others, it remains one of my favorite game concepts.  I also introduced it to my children because it it an educational game.  They took to it right away."
14542,This game has eaten up a large portion of my life. I don't regret a thing.
14543,pretty fun
14544,Very niiiiiice
14545,10/10
14546,I love it.

Still love this game though."
14548,"Nice, Addictive!"
14549,"the games good
"
14550,Ehh game ight.
14551,"NOTE: Requires all DLC, but is the best Civ in the series should you only get one. Its regularly on sale as an entire collection as well."
14552,enjoyable game but like most in the series late game management becomes tedious and boring
14553,neat
14554,Civ at its best.
14555,i love this game
14556,"Many victory options, just not war, with lots of diverse cultures.  Reminds me of a game that came out 25-30 years ago with alien cultures.  Excellent city building.  Funny interactions.  Love it."

14558,"great game, superior to number 6"
14559,good game!
14560,"My friends never play enough to let me nuke them, otherwise great game."
14561,quite simply. the archetyping endless sandbox game in my opinion(as nearly 16k hours will attest)
14562,Great game.
14563,Fantastic game!
14564,"very moist, i rate very good"
14565,Better than Civ VI!
14566,fun game
14567,a great distraction
14568,"Very good game, 248 hours played and more to come!"
14569,"It is a well thought out, digestible Anthropological simulator."
14570,Good
14571,"1,113 hours later: ""just one more turn...""

Excellent strategy game with plenty of longevity and a variety of difficulty levels to suit your level of play. Can be played really in-depth but also works for a more casual player"
14572,Good game!
14573,Just a great game.
14574,"So I was looking for a new management / strategy / city builder game... I was tempted to buy Civ 6 and in the end I installed Civ 5 once again, and could not be happier playing it again... and again... and again... an again...

@devs: please sell us some new DLCs :)"
14575,poggers
14576,you like turn based strategy? then this is the game for you.
14577,"I've played Civ since version 1.  And while this game has consumed many hours of my time, it all comes down to a central flaw that has never been addressed by the design team.  The game is about founding cities and the fallacy that evolution must be applied to everything we know about any civilization.  It ignores the reality that some of the most ancient people's were highly advanced and that discoveries made things they were already doing easier and or more profitable.  While the mods have kept me playing for some time, it's to the point where no mod can reinvigorate a flawed premise and platform.  Build enough cities, you win the game.  That's not how things happened.  If so, Carthage would have wasted the Romans."
14578,"everything very fun with my boys
"
14579,
14580,"One of the best of the series with new mechanics.
I enjoy it more than Civilization 6 to be honest.
Just one more turn..."
14581,"I played 17 hours straight, lost an exam and IT WAS WORTH IT!"
14582,"I have played every Civilization game since the very first Civ back in the mid 90s. While it took until the second expansion pack (Brave New World) to unlock the game's full potential, this is one of the very best Civ games made, and I have found lots of replay value in it.
For those who have played other Civ games, the mechanic that aims to prevent the single strategy of 'out settle all other Civs' will prove frustrating - expansion is actively penalised, which feels contrary to the philosophy of previous games. But there is enough richness in the game to enjoy very many playthroughs.
For those new to Civilization and the 4X genre, Civ V is just as good a launchpad as the most recent edition (Civ VI) or any of the previous editions. It will take time to learn what works and does not work, but the fact there is always scope to learn new strategies to win is half of what makes the game fun!"
14583,"Very guuddddd
"
14584,The best Civ game.
14585,fun gameee
14586,good graphics unlike civilization 6 which looks like a friggin disney game lol..

14588,strategy and educational
14589,it is awesome
14590,graet strategy game
14591,my first civ game i have played  it was pretty good
14592,"This game is a lot of fun to play with friends, its one of those games you start then look at the clock and realize its 5am! would recommend"
14593,It's good
14594,"The best online multiplayer strategy game that I have ever played. The only issue with the game is its stability issues in online games (not allways, but caused by low spec. PCs, bad internet connections and people dissconecting on purpose). Still a 11/10 must try game :D"
14595,It's alright
14596,Better than civ 6 and civ 7 will suck if devs listen to the jernos
14597,good
14598,great.
14599,"It's a must have.  

The vanilla game is nice but I highly recommend at least the BNW and G&K espansions. Wait for a sale and buy the complete bundle with all the DLCs, it's worth it."
14600,"positively speaking, this game consists of many if legendary world leaders and empires; adding different methodologies for win and each empires specific characteristics the game itself is unique.

negative point about this game is that it might take too much long for a player to finish a game (win) - it might take up to 3000- 5000 turns based on my experience.

2nd negative point, which is completely objective, this game is not suitable for online gaming, so keep it in mind before paying."
14601,"amazing game, one of the best civ games ever made."
14602,Just finished my first game.
14603,Its a good game... I never stopped playing it
14604,"Hours and hours of immersive addictive fun.... This game is always different each time you play and you can win using multiple strategies. Play with people or just against the AI, it makes no difference to the fun you gonna be having"
14605,Really fun game. Modding makes it even better.
14606,gyu8ioi
14607,HEY YO GOOD GAME GOOD GAME
14608,An absolute masterpiece.
14609,outstanding game  well-balanced
14610,The game offers realistic looking graphics and plenty of diverse mods to add versatility  to your game experience. Does not look cartoony like civ 6.
14611,l
14612,This is my favorite game. I love to play this with my husband it is how we have spent the last five winters and I love it!
14613,If you like a slow paced game where you can conquer the world or just be a real jerk you will like this game
14614,"Civilization is just the best game ever.  Even V is 10 yrs old, but still like to play"
14615,tis great
14616,"very nice game
"
14617,Great Game!!!
14618,Still play this more than Civ 6.
14619,available to all skill levels. Absorbing but watch the time as it will run away with you!
14620,I like that this game uses strategy.
14621,Love this game
14622,I've played 1216 hours of this game...I'd say I got my money's worth.

Mods make a world of difference to your over all experience.  Find the right one(s) and you'll come back to this game again and again.

Good stuff"
14628,Not Bad..
14629,"If you are thinking of getting civ 6 because it's newer, rethink your horrible decision and get this masterpiece."
14630,".

14631,Love it. just one more turn!

11/10 buy this instead of civ 6 lol"
14633,chess on crack
14634,well maybe I shouldn't recommend this game because you will get sucked in... just one more turn.
14635,It is a classic turn-based strategy game that has a good mix of complexity and simplicity. The graphics are good and detailed and you have a lot of different options to choose from. Can either be long games or short depending on what you want to do. Good game all around!
14636,"Great game, even being a little older great fall back game"
14637,cool
14638,not too bad tbh
14639,well made game.
14640,"Addictive. With out realising youve been playing for 7 hours and its 2 am

14643,"Great game. Requires a lot of time, but it is interesting."
14644,Terra Novum!
14645,"The best, and no cartoony graphics like Civ VI."
14646,"I've apparently spent like over 6k hours on this game... So while a bunch of it is surely AFK and left overnight, I gotta say that I wouldn't be surprised if this hours played is 70% accurate."
14647,best civ
14648,cool game
14649,Very simple game play that is very fun to play
14650,Great game when your watching tv and don't need to pay attention
14651,great game ! Specially with Pocatelo :)
14652,A very detailed game.
14653,Multiplayer is great but servers are absolute trash to manage. You will know what I mean if you played Civ 5 multiplayer.
14654,"The early to mid game through to renaissance is absolutely fantastic. Very well rounded in terms of science, culture, trade and warfare. Many players coming from a CIV4 background dislike the no stacking option. However I personally think it adds a whole new depth in terms of using the terrain (think Persians vs 300 Spartans guarding a mountain pinch point). My biggest disappointment is the late game becomes too focused on warfare at the expense of the other cultural aspects that enrich the game. Also the diplomacy becomes unpredictable as allies who you have spent centuries fostering relations with suddenly back stab you for silly reasons.  In fact the late game is a real slog and I quickly lost enjoyment of the game once reaching the Atomic age."
14655,"Its much better with the DLCs and its made to hook newcomers into the series so its not as complicated as the 4 or 3 or 6 but you can spice it up with a few DLC-s. Its kinda unbalanced sometimes and the devs arent gonna fix it, its an old game, but its fun to play alone and with friends."
14656,"The vanilla game is OK, some players complain that it is not completely in balance.
If you are a starter (or want it the easy way) play this and see for yourself.
With seven levels of difficulties there will be one that fits you.

With the Vox Populi mod the behavioure of the game is much sharper, in general it gets a raise of three levels!

And there are endless may more mods to change the game. There will be some combination that you liken.
If not, you can always have a try with Civ VI 

Civ V is my favorite game.

This makes the highest levels really difficult!"
14657,this game goes hard
14658,yes very good
14659,"Great game, build an empire from ancient times to modern times. Found cities, fight wars, claim resources, found religions and build a culture to rule the world, etc, etc. Really is fun, but addicting."
14660,yay!
14661,"This is what you want instead of Civ VI, trust me."
14662,i cant stop. please help

14665,fun
14666,games can go on forever

14676,Great game all around if you're a fan of strategy games. Solid 9/10

14686,this 10 year old game looks better than Civ 6
14687,"Civ5, released in 2010, will be remembered as the game which is still being played with almost the same amount of people as its successor Civ6 released 4 years ago."
14688,"You can attack and pillage whoever you want, including siam.

10/10 reccomend"
14689,It is made more for adults and has a complex game play rather than being too cartoony like the civ 6
14690,"This game is a banger - don't look at the lame game photos or YT videos as they make it look boring - buy it of CD Keys - the complete collection - its extremely worth it and adds a lot of new players.

"
14716,Waiting for ... to end their turn
14717,"This is the best simulator ever designed (along with the other Civs of course). A fabulous experience of seeing an entire empire unfold based on decisions around interlinked concepts - religion, culture, research etc. The way it moulds all of it together in a meaningful way while providing you a sense of authorship  - I'm hypnotised every time."
14718,"Just getting stared but so far great game.
If you really wanna enjoy the full game i would definitely recommend getting the expansions!
I would definitely recommend Civilization V over Civilization® VI without a doubt.

14719,It constantly crashes on Macs

14733,"A really good game, arguably the best Sid Meir's Civilization's game out there; Where it lacks graphically it makes up in good game-play, and a great modding community.
If you want to try a Civ game, start with Civ VI. But if you liked that but thought it was lacking something, try Civ V."
14734,i still play it. i find its game play and mechanics more enjoyable than the newer civ 6

14736,"Always loved Civilisation brand.
And this one is really good. I used to play on the 2, 3 and 4. I love each one ♥ Easy to understand, and to play. We have several level of difficulty and tho the last are really hard.... I love a good challenges ♥ One day I'll get those reward ♥
Still, the game I play when I want to have fun, or when I want to start a strategic time ♥ 
I love it. Really."
14737,Complex and challenging.

14739,It's very interesting game.
14740,"Loved civ 4 when I was younger, and civ 5 is definetly a good sequel. Bought the complete edition on Ebay for around $10. Great value!"
14741,На вечерок сойдет.
14742,Fantastic strategy game. Each civ (country you can play with) has their own distinct style of gameplay. If you like strategies this is definetly a must try
14743,I too remember when The Egyptians and Americans fought in the great Wonder war of 2000 BC where the Americans made the pyramids and got bogged down invading Egypt after they made this great wall that looked like it was from china.
14744,"The most worthy game. Played civilization since the first version back in 1992, this is a worthy sequel"
14745,"Absolutely love this game. As you can tel 561 hours at time of this review. Its well balanced, great graphics and feel, great and challenging game play."
14746,"[h1]Good Gameplay, But Overall a Mixed Bag[/h1]
[hr][/hr]
If you like strategy / management - style games, you'll probably really like Civ5.
I like some of the mechanics of Civ5 better than those of Civ6, and I feel like this game encourages ""building tall"" over ""building wide"", which is a better tactic in Civ6.
Whether or not you prefer that depends on your playstyle.

This game can be a blast with friends.
I have really fond memories of going over to my buddy's house and playing Civ5 on LAN; however, that must've been where the multiplayer experience ended as I've revisited the game with my friends recently and have... well, other feelings.
The multiplayer is bad.
It is buggy garbage.
Just a couple of points in my recent experiences with Civ5 multiplayer:
[list]
    [*] If you would like to play on timed turns (almost a necessity to keep the game moving amongst several people)... don't.
I've yet to find a way to play on timed turns that lets you resume a game save, or that allows rejoining if someone disconnects or has to restart their client. If a turn times out while someone is reconnecting, the game will softlock. Because you can't load a timed turn save without also softlocking, you will have wasted however much time you just spent with your friends. It is infuriating.
    [*] In a multiplayer session (and to an extent on single-player sessions but less-so), you may come across a point where you can't move any units, choose any productions, or interact with the game beyond the pause menu. This is because you are in an invisible menu. If you hit Esc, you will most likely exit the invisible menu and be able to resume gameplay. This can be extremely frustrating, especially if you are playing timed turns and do not know what is happening. This problem can look similar to normal in-game lag, and is kinda hard to pick out.
    [*] The turn timer (note that this is different from timed turns which require you complete a turn in x number of seconds, and is the number of turns taken until a score victory is evaluated) is decided by the game pace setting. The game pace setting also minimally bumps the amount of research, culture, etc. gained per turn. You can't turn the turn timer off to force the game to be won through a science, domination, culture, or other victory state because the game pace overrides this and must be set. If you unset a turn timer and save a game, when you reload the save the turn timer will be in place. This is also extremely frustrating when combined with other save game issues.
[/list]
All that said, the single-player experience is okay.

[h1] So, Would I Recommend Civ5? [/h1]
[hr][/hr]
That's really hard for me to do. Maybe, if you keep in mind what I've said regarding multiplayer and this game's garbage serialization and just want to play on LAN and have a beer and pizza with your dudes. If you grew up with these Civ mechanics and like them, and are swayed by nostalgia, maybe. Internet play though has left a sour taste in my mouth and I'm now looking at Civ6 for a more stable multiplayer experience."
14747,Great game if you have 6-8 hours to kill.
14748,with dlc its playable with mods its incredible
14749,its lit!
14750,entertaining for hours and challenging
14751,So many turns! I love this game!!!!
14752,"Even after buying Civ 6, I still happily come back to 5 and can't stop playing.  The replayability of Civ games is outstanding, you can win 10 games and still just as excited to try a new leader, map, scenerio, and a different type of victory."
14753,"Great game, plenty of variety in how it plays and plenty of challenges to chose from if you wish to pursue them."
14754,better than 6
14755,Best Civilization game hands down.
14756,Good strategy game
14757,"Fun, immersive."
14758,Better than Civilization VI
14759,Only game I've ever reviewed I play other games on and off but always come back to this one

14762,"""You've played for 1546 hours, would you recommend this game to others?""

14764,The male characters in this game are really hot.
14765,gg
14766,"Recommended not only for the learning youngsters of us, also very interesting for the grown ones.
Could be helpful to understand the qualities and importance of all indigenous tribes and nations throughout the Worlds history to be able to relate oneself within a unconditioned connection amongst every being."
14767,it's okay
14768,"I played this with my best friend, he died this year.

This is a good game."
14769,yes
14770,its i good time killer
14771,Addictive as all get out.
14772,good
14773,Breaking settlement treaties and crossing rivers in search of iron since 2000 B.C.E. 10/10 would wage a forever war again.
14774,"I still remember the first time I played this, started at 1am all the way until 8am. No regrets. Everything from the music, the pacing, to the scenarios is top-notch here. If you are not into turn-based titles, this one will change that, it did for me."

14776,Great game.... like all the others before it.
14777,"great game, that's it, that's the review"

14779,WWIII any one?
14780,"I haven't really had a chance to try it out, but its kinda fun."

14790,"Very nice, except I am bad and can only win on difficulty 2/10"
14791,"If you're really into what's called ""turn-based strategy"" but isn't, you might like this game. If you're looking for mindless click entertainment you might like this game. If you enjoy memorizing tech trees you might like this game. Me? I'm disappointed. I can't really recommend it. I can't really say it's complete garbage. It's fairly mediocre, as far as games go for an OG like myself. Nothing to get excited about here. Move on. Maybe try it if it's on sale for pennies. It won't blow your mind. It won't heighten your state of consciousness."

14795,"So Civs is a great intro to strategy games. However, for me personally it quickly becomes formulaic and a race for certain technologies and wonders. Simply amazing for new comers, but after a couple dozen hours it quickly becomes stale and slow for me personally."

14799,fought the Africans for 1000 years as the Koreans. Best timeline
14800,"pretty decent but lacks in optimization, late turns turn to a crawl especially with a full game, shitty stability - nothing beats getting the game crash or stop responding after you have spent the evening in a game"
14801,I playd 171h this game and i will play 171 more.
14802,lots of hours of enjoyment
14803,"funny man with sword gp BRRRRRRRRRRRRRR
"
14804,You know a game is good when you accidentally play it for 12 hours straight. Enough said
14805,Good times with the boys
14806,It is a great game if you like strategy based games.
14807,Still haven't finished a game
14808,Still the best one. I refuse to purchase civ 6 since they made the new civs all cartoony and soft. Civ 5 is still the best one in the franchise.
14809,"It's just e to the step, just flip it stick it see yah later bye."
14810,very fun played for 20 hours on my first day lol
14811,Like it
14812,good game
14813,Still the best version of CIV
14814,"Playing Civ V as a newcomer to the series. I've heard loads about Sid Meier's games, and playing this now definitely doesn't disappoint! ""Getting lost in the fun"" is a gross understatement for this game; hours (and turns!) go by in the blink of an eye! I could literally play through the night! Awesomely addictive game, challenging for all levels (I've grown from being an absolute noob to an average intermediate player now, and the AI difficulty allows us to always choose an opponent that matches our level of ability!). Can't wait to get back to the game!"
14815,"Love this game, Classic Civ as it should be, way better then civ 6, but buy the complete addition"
14816,.
14817,is good and fun lol
14818,"The endless playability is what keeps bringing me back. Each new game brings something different or some new challenge to the table, making for endless hours of enjoyment. As they like to say, all you want to do is just play ""one more turn""."
14819,Great turn baed game! I've enjoyed it for years but the Steam platform is extremely buggy and the game will not run for weeks on end. Very disappointed in STEAM!
14820,its a chill game ive not played multiplayer yet but seems like a fun game
14821,"Educational, fun  AND addictive! This is MY kind of game! :-)"
14822,Good game. Game is good. Is good game.
14823,a fun and chill game to relax with and hang with friends
14824,"This is Amazing they should make a 7
"
14825,Absolutely fantastic game. I have been playing it for years and even opted to keep playing it rather than it's successor Civ VI as I hate the newer art style. This game's art style is fantastic and the mechanics make a victory very rewarding.
14826,I enjoy the strategy and pace of the game.  Very relaxing and enjoyable.
14827,GG!
14828,Despite its flaws its still the best version of CIV and one of the best games ever made hands down
14829,Its pretty nice
14830,MASTER TIME ASSASSIN
14831,"Endless hours of game play, 10/10 :)"
14832,Good game. Should buy.
14833,Love this game!
14834,"You start out with a small one city Civ and before you know it, the birds are letting you know it is time to go to work."
14835,"great introduction to history.
"
14836,Too legit too quit
14837,"This is definitely a game you get caught up in. Having played CIV 2, and 3 I can say this is easily the best thus far. Looking at 6 just looks like the game turned into a joke."
14838,"Every installment of Civ since 2 is worse than the previous one. This one is rather bad, but Civ 6 is even worse.:("
14839,CIV V forever
14840,Just another turn!
14841,"This game takes a while to master. Once you get the hang of it, it's a blast to play while watching a movie or listening to music and vibing. 10/10 game."
14842,This game is great if you just want to occupy yourself while doing something else. I play the game on my computer while watching TV. It does not require constant attention. It also has many historical facts for the trivia buff. It also has a ton of different game modes for when it gets boring; you can change it up. I bought Civ VI and I hate it. Why would they make so different. I can't stand the silly cartoonish Civs and policy choosing is just stupid. I want my money back! Civ V is the best game I've ever played as evidenced by the almost 13000 hrs I have into it!
14843,"gut gaim

14844,"Love the game and the franchise. I wish there were larger maps, like really large maps and that's about the only thing I can think of at the moment - otherwise I love it!"
14845,"pretty good

14846,a
14847,Given my hours on this game I cannot really say anything other than its a great strategy game. I am still terrible at it. Build an empire and destroy the others! Or just build up and keep everyone happy.
14848,great time-sink
14849,"Classic game, far better than Civ VI"
14850,mad vibes. nuke ghandi
14851,Just one... more... round.
14852,ha ha
14853,good for multiplayer games w/ banter amongst friends
14854,A realistic sim of the diff civs..
14855,Literally would sell my left foot to Satan to keep playing this game 11/10
14856,"It is fun creating alternative histories for the civilizations involved, and ""meeting"" their leaders.  The game play is engaging and fast-paced enough so that it does not become tedious."
14857,I love to play this game with my friends
14858,"Game is reasonably balanced unless you play England. As soon as you build your first Ship of the Line, everyone even those that you have not contacted will declare war on you."
14859,great game
14860,.
14861,"I liked real time strategy games like command and conquer and age of empires, but this game sounded interesting since there are more ways to win than just fighting (though that is still an option) so I gave it a try. It's really interesting that there are different ways for each player to win the match, so the enemy won't necessarily be competing the same way as you, or give you the time to do what you need to win the way you want. Games can take a very long time, but it can be addicting and hard to stop. I'm surprised how much I enjoy it."
14862,"Pros: Not as awful as VI
         Faerun Mod

Cons: Base game is overly complicated, bloated and slow. Mods only help so much. The long decline of Civ accelerated with this installment.

I would only recommend for the Faerun (Forgotten Realms Fantasy) mod, not for a regular Civ experience. I put many hours in on that, so obviously it was worth the price."
14863,"This is the most fun I have ever had in a paradox game. The graphics are great, the nations are somewhat balanced. However the happiness system forces one to build tall, and without the Brave New World and Gods and Kings expansions, the game is not as fun."
14864,"My dad and I have been playing this game since it came out, and other than the sentimental value i think it is the most well rounded strategy/simulation game I've ever played. never-ending fun."
14865,it is fun
14866,It doesnt work since the last update on Mac's latest version... terrible
14867,Great game to play with other people. Love these games where you able to control movements and economy of a country. Just love it.
14868,As someone who grew up playing obscene amounts of Civ 3 I can say without a doubt this game is a great upgrade on the concepts. Each civ is more unique making for more dynamic play without having one main strategy for all civs that works best. The emphasis also moves away from war always being the best way to win. Roads cost money rather than gaining money so you have to be more strategic with your building. I also very much prefer the one unit per tile as it is more strategic when it comes to combat since you can't just get into wars of attrition with stack of death. If you like civ I very much recomend this game.
14869,"ל9
"
14870,Get it with the dlc
14871,perfect
14872,A good strategy game for when you want to focus on something. Great multiplayer.
14873,Still the best Civilization game out there.
14874,"Civ5 won't launch, has anybody been able to solve this problem? Thanks!"
14875,I love this game. I played over 400 hours and I'm not even close of getting tired. Its complexity makes it a great game to enjoy and re-matches are always new opportunities to apply what you've learned on the previous games. The only principal con I could think about is that you have to gets the entire game with all DLC to enjoy a well-balanced game and all the good features.
14876,ok
14877,"Worst Mod support! 
EVERY TIME you want to play with mods the game configures the game data. 
There is NO way of restarting a game WITH the mods AFTER the first round. 
You have to go to the main menu and then back into the game. 
That are TWO configure data events. 

And this game is ABSOLUTELY HORRIBLY BORING without MODS!!!!!!!"
14878,game good
14879,"Super fun game! Just getting into it, there is a lot that it entails, but not impossible to learn! Great game for those who love strategy!"
14880,epic.dadadadadadad
14881,Not at the same level of the previous Civilization games but still the best turns game
14882,I've lost hours into this game.

14884,Good stuff.
14885,By far my fav civ game
14886,rule the world
14887,"Love it, better than civ 6"
14888,as civ saga game is magnificent worth playing every minute one more turn
14889,Great game!
14890,"Great game, the best of the bunch"
14891,"If you like relaxing turn based game play which is a cross between a city builder and a turn based war game, then this game would be good for you. It has a small dose of history through technological innovation and city names but overall this game has an unwritten history that is decided by the player. 

You start with 1 troop and 1 settler, you build your first city, you decide what technology to begin with and what building to build first, then the turns begin and your adventure can go a thousand different directions. 
Are you going to be a warlord and pillage the world? A diplomat who is turning nations against one another? Perhaps a cultural leader that influences society? Or maybe you will just hope to survive to the end as the other nations exceed your progress and put you in constant peril.

My only recommendations are buy it on sale with the entire DLC collection (I think this cost me $12.)  I also prefer this game to civilization 6, but I can see why people would like 6 more.  My only real complaints is the difficulty settings are not ""harder"" in the sense that the CPU gets smarter, it is just more punitive in terms of resources. Also there is a Linux version so big plus there for the 1%-ers on Steam."
14892,yes
14893,fun.
14894,is nice
14895,Great strategy game. Never the same each time
14896,the wedding was nice but the reception wasnt so great  needed better parking.

14903,game good very nice! America game number 1!!!
14904,"Great game, easily one of my favourites that i can always return to"
14905,"100's of hours of fun! Better than 6 to me, more user friendly."
14906,"i'm a casual player, played all civ games, diff King to Emperor, I find this game well balanced and enjoy it even after 200h of single player gameplay,"
14907,good
14908,"All of a sudden, regardless of all fixes online that I've read on STEAM and off STEAM, my version of Civ V doesn't seem to launch anymore.  Instead it crashes as soon as you press play.  I have an iMac OSX 10.15 machine.  Pretty sad and I can't get my money back on this because I already logged 430 hours on this game."
14909,I prefer it to 6

14912,Love hearing that audio clip when my unit dies
14913,"This is the most played game I have played, love this game so much"
14914,"If you need a way to dull the infinite suffering that comes from the banality of your meaningless existence the Sid Meier's Civilization franchise is a game you should consider trying. As of this typing, I see that my playing time is approximately 33.3 days. I have dedicated just over a month of conscious life to this version of the game alone. Imagine what I could have done instead. 33.3 days is enough time to accomplish a lot of useful and meaningful pursuits or at the very least it is enough time to achieve some measure of success in progressing some larger life goal. The point being is that when I needed to completely zone out, forget that I am incredibly flawed and my existence is at best a fleeting phenomenon this franchise has always been there for me. With that being said, the sixth installment is inferior and you should just stick to this version until the seventh one comes out. Overall, I give the game four out of five stars for being reliable and at least mildly entertaining to me as my existence slowly fades back into an inert state."
14915,This game is a fucking god.  100% worth all the hours I've spent.

14984,Fantastic. Very fun. Only issue is that multiplayer can be very buggy. Apart from that it's a great game.
14985,easy to learn. overall well put together game.
14986,"It's a relaxing game. Great to just sit down and slowly develop the world.

Just be aware diplomacy doesn't exist. No matter what you do, or how much of a doormat you are as you let everyone steal technologies from you and don't do anything to upset anyone. You're still going to get the whole world calling for your head, its just a matter of time.

It's easily the biggest flaw in the game. A warmonger score that gets higher and higher and doesn't decay nearly fast enough in the game without 3rd party help. Take out a rampaging civilization that declares war on you nonstop and does everything to make your life miserable? Well, now you're the evil guy. Even 200-300 turns later, the other civilizations are still going to take it into account that you dared do anything offensive and like you less for it.

If you can deal with that very, very outstanding issue or get a 3rd party workaround to your liking, the game is absolutely wonderful."
14987,Playing on ubuntu linux 20.04.1 LTS. So far no crashes or problems. Also enjoying the game
14988,Really good game

14990,"Really good sit down game with friends, really holds up over time and is much better than Civ VI in my opinion."

14992,This game is perfection.  Highly recommended over Civ 6
14993,Awesome game would be better if it didn't break in MP.
14994,Just...One...more...turn....
14995,Civ V > Civ VI
14996,Much better graphics than Civ 6.  It is balanced against the stack of doom and has a more generous location of resources than Civ 3.
14997,it's like crack but it's $12 and you don't die
14998,"Endless replayability
"
14999,"I've played Civ since it first came out way back when as ""Colonization"", the old bit map game. Civ5 is THE BEST version of the franchise."
15000,lovely game
15001,"THIS IS EPIC GAME! 
Every strategy master should know this piece of art. My personal opinion is that Civ V is better than Civ VI, but later games and upgrades have gained also lot of positive aspects.

15002,This game is big richard swingin
15003,Great Game! I always find myself able to replay it time after time
15004,x
15005,"Among all TBS games, Civ V reigns supreme. It has hundreds of hours of replayability, endless variation, and a great blend of detailed micromanagement with a low skill floor for players who like to be less granular. I can load up a random game with a random leader, and play for hours taking my empire from the ancient era to the information age. I never get bored, and with the excellent modding community there's an infinite supply of new and enjoyable add-ons to finely tune your experience. 

And all that's just the singleplayer!

Civ V multiplayer is great fun. Grab three or four of your friends, and compete for world domination while privately text chatting to team up and betray your allies. Once you include other human players, the real political intrigue gets involved and elevates the game to an even higher level of fun.

The only downsides to the game are minor ones. Namely it can be boring waiting for multiplayer wars to drag on with consecutive turns, and the game suffers without the (in my opinion must-have) G&K and BNW expansions.

I cannot recommend the game enough. Truly it's a testament to how great the game is, that IMO it surpasses [i]its own sequel[/i] in quality! I suggest you purchase the complete bundle to get the expansions as well as some of the great DLC civs."
15006,"Probably the my favorite Civ game.
(With the Brave New World Expansion Pack & all other dlc)

It's as addictive as crack, you just sorta start playing when you get a few moments after work/school/etc and suddenly its 3am and you gotta invade Poland before they overwhelm you with their superior horses. Then it's 5am and your enemies have all either decided to gang up on you or you're in a desperate struggle to invade the militarily superior superpower before they can win the game.

Considering the time of this review I think it's fair to compare it to Civ 6, it's sequel. Me personally, I like Civ 5 better just on the basis of ability to go multiple directions. With Civ 5 you can go for any victory in the game with any leader/civ, although some have minor advantages towards certain victory types, your civ pick doesn't make you feel obligated to move towards any particular victory type. 
In Civ 6, you are much more inclined to chose a leader built for a particular victory. There are some all-arounders that can go for any, but it's not the same freedom to pick any leader you want.
Civ 5 admittedly has weaker progression, & less strategic value compared to Civ 6. Part of why I like Civ 5 more is that it's a fair bit more casual than Civ 5, in and of that you don't need to take such a active playstyle. In Civ 6 when you place your very first district, you need to ensure that your placement doesn't screw up your strategy for the entire game. 
I also find that Civ 5 has weaker military play compared to Civ 6, mainly due to how Civ 6's culture/civic system allows players not going for tech to build a somewhat capable army.

Overall I find Civ 5 to be inferior to Civ 6 when it comes to mechanics relating to most of the gameplay, however I find many of the mechanics which force active planning to be tedious. This is completely subjective, but just due to me wanting to play in a more laid back manner I find myself pushing away from Civ 6. 

However, I still find Civ 5 to be my preference for the sake of picking up a game, and just playing right through it. I can go for any playstyle I want as any leader, and I don't always need to plan 15 turns ahead to win on higher difficulties.


TLDR: I like Civ 5 more than Civ 6 because Civ 5 is less mentally intensive.

If Civ 6 redid the leader system and had an option to mellow out on all the active conditions (like eurekas, emergencies, keeping up with the ages), I'd probably prefer 6 over 5. (disclaimer, haven't played the global warming DLC in 6)
Also I hate that I have to plan districts with intent so far into the late game."

15008,Good game.

They have broken this, and claim to be ""working on a fix"" which seems to be not the case as its been broken for over a year. 
This is better than Civ 6 (which is just a horrible game). But come on, how are 2 different versions (numbers) of the same game not compatible enough to play?"

15017,"I played this game periodically in college and a lot more since the world started to end in the beginning of 2020. Anyways, it's really easy to get so sucked into this game that time literally flies by. Literally yesterday I remember the morning sun rising and grabbing coffee to start a game only to realize that it got dark and it was almost midnight. Civilization V is fun to play alone, with friends, and modded if that's your cup of tea. You get to learn a good bit of cool history here and there as well. Now go out and create a civilization that will stand the test of time!"
15018,It's the good civilization

15031,Have you considered a trade agreement with England?
15032,It is awsome
15033,"It's a fine game.  Replay is it's hallmark.  Not only for the characters/regimes, but replay for types of win as well as maps.   I'm about to achieve a cultural victory with Romans on huge four corners map on Prince/Epic.  I might even nuke the Russians if they don't behave.     Of course, play with the DLCs bundled."

Somehow get every single other country to declare war on Gandhi at the same time.

Fuck me I misclicked while dragging the map. 
Nuclear missile launches at my own border. Fuck.
Splash damage hits two main allies, entire world coalition now declares war on me AND Gandhi.

Closed out of my 20+ hour campaign and haven't opened it since.

Absolute banger of a game. 10/10."

15083,One more turn pls
15084,each turn takes ages
15085,Civ 4 is better
15086,great game
15087,"I just noticed I never wrote a review for this; its time to change that. Civ 5 is a fantastic game with a great community. Each game is fun, exciting, with loads of custom play styles you can achieve. 

The online portion is where the game shines. It's imperative to find a good group.  That consists of people who won't rage quit and will continue playing until its clear who the most likely winning empire will be (Such as late-game when a player has the top score in 99% of categories[food, population, production, army, etc]. Or perform so poorly that they can't compete against the superpowers(the top player that dominated the game either because of a huge lead or cause he got lucky). My hours played speak for themselves, and they primarily come from multiplayer.

One tip of advice; I'm not trying to throw shade, but it needs to be said. If you see a player named ""Warcrimes,"" be aware. He is like a ghost, he is always playing every weekend for some reason, and he has such a terrible reputation for rage quitting, being toxic, and still picking an aggro strategy, often leaving when it doesn't work. I wanted to disclose this cause if you do Host a lobby, and he joins; he may ruin it and not even care that he did it. If you don't believe me, when you enter a lobby, ask how they feel about ""Warcrimes,"" and you will see various opinions/reactions. I try to be nice, but he can be an awful person to be around.

I primarily host eight-player games (you need a wired connection, or else the game will crash or freeze. Six-players work fine without a wired connection, but turns are silkier with a wired connection), named ""All DLC FFA."" If you ever see me, feel free to say hi, but don't be toxic, please.

Allowing comments, if people disagree, they are welcome to voice their thoughts and complaints; I hope everyone can have a productive talk instead of an argumentive one."
15088,"Civ is a very fun albeit very time consuming game. If you have some friends that enjoy long strategy games, and some free time, Civ 5 can be a lot of fun."
15089,"This game saved my life.

I am 27.

My ex-wife and I have a daughter together, and adopted our son together. They are now both 4 years old.

When we were going through our separation, I found myself lost and miserable. I was self destructive. I got so mad one day from everything spiraling out of my control that I punched some concrete in a moment of overwhelming emotion. That caused me to break my 5th metacarpal in my right hand... my working hand... my games hand.. the hand that I held and carried my children to bed with.. The hand I desperately needed to make sure I could continue to provide.

After learning of the severity of my self-inflicted damage, I was borderline suicidal. Keep in mind that just a few months before this, I was the happiest man with no history of depression or anxiety. I have never had fits of rage, or been one to break down and cry, but I was in a low spot that just really buried me from being able to see the light on the other side.

Having nothing better to do, I searched for a game I could play, ONE HANDED while I recovered. I somehow stumbled upon this game and read some of the reviews. I decided that it had to be worth a shot... I must admit, I didn't beat the game, or play nearly as long as some of you. In fact, I may have only played this game a day or two.. With that being said, after doing so, I had a new found joy and hope for life. I was able to put behind me the pain and suffering that had been cast over me. I was able to experience other peoples joy and happiness. I was able to see the fruits of my ""labor"". I relaxed for 5 ♥♥♥♥ing minutes to this music long enough to realize that I was going to be okay.

After coming to that realization, I turned the game off, and I went back to work. It hurt my hand like hell but I was motivated. I stopped feeling so damn sorry for myself, and I became the father I needed to be in that moment, not the weak boy I was behaving as.

Today, I am close friend with my kids mother. We don't fight, or argue, or say hurtful things to each other. We are parents, and friends.

I now have 3 kids. My third child is, wait for it, ALSO 4 YEARS OLD. The woman I am with was going through a very similar situation at the time of my own separation, and we just stumbled in to each others life unexpectedly. We have been in a relationship for a year now, and are very happy together.

Moral of the story, you never know what life holds in store for you, and if I would have given up when all the odds were stacked against me, I wouldn't be where I am today. This silly little game helped me realize that.

Thank you"
15090,"Although my PC does struggle to run it sometimes, it is a great game that keeps me engaged for hours and is honestly a comfort game for me now. It can really challenge you but only if you want, if you want a casual game or are still learning there's a super easy setting to chill on. Love it."
15091,great
15092,Complete game
15093,I like to play normal version of Civ 5 and now I can not uninstall the Brave New World expansion %) dunno why. I'm pretty sure I should be able to... I dont likve tBNW I wanna play my sweet Civ5 Vanilla!!!

15101,Fun and helps pass time.
15102,"Garbage game with the worst playerbase since league of legends. Buggy glitchy crashy shit that they never bother to fix because they just pump out civ 6 and start fleecing people all over again. Release 1 $50 DLC at a time for a billion DLC's and then instead of ever fixing the broken code or fixing crashes or lag or multiplayer issues, you just move on to the next one and fleece the idiot player base again.... unreal... Greedy company, crashy buggy game with the worst community to ever exist in a game (aside from league of legends)"
15103,one more turn...
15104,it's okay i guess
15105,I have always loved the Civilization series. And over the years they have gotten better and better.
15106,Solid game.
15107,quick combat and different maps
15108,Civ is the best game ever second only to chess

15117,one of the best turn based strategy games ever made
15118,"Better then Civ 6, honestly civ 6 doesn't feel balanced at all by any means. Not that balance is a huge issue. But Bots on the game have obvious preset limits for trades and demands.  The AI of them are rather weak at best."

15122,"The programme generates a new map every time unless you load a saved game, so the game is always different. The game is very intuitive and easy to play. I bought the original game years ago and I have bought every upgrade since. I have never found a better game."
15123,"Civilizace je prostě skvělá. To se ví. A páta Civilizace je teď asi nejlepší koupě. Proč, když existuje šestý díl, ptáte se? 
Protože Civ5 je hotová, dokončená a kompletní, narozdíl od šestky, pro kterou stále vychází DLC a nový obsah. A to znamená několik věcí 1) Celá Civ5 se dá koupit za pár korun (já sehnal kompletní edici na Xzone za 500 kč) 2) Moderská komunita je živá a aktivní, protože vědí, že další DLC, které vyjde, jim nerozbije jejich mód, na kterém pracovali mnoho týdnů 3) Vy z práce moderské komunity můžete přímo těžit! 
Ne vážně, tolik super custom scénářů a tahových strategií, udělaných pomocí Civ5 SDK má jen málokterá strategická hra. 
R.E.D. WWII, Sengoku Jidai, Napoleonské války... je to vše zde a je to super. 

Kupte si Civ 5 a s koupí šestky počkejte, až vyjde sedmý díl. Eazy.

15126,too cluttered just eventually a mess
15127,"I played 2000 hours before brave new world came out, then kind of just left the civ franchise for a few years.  Every couple of years I'd play a few games then put it down again.  However, I finally took the time to learn all the new stuff from bnw and gods+kings about 6 mos ago, now I've played it 900 hours or so this year.  The game is so much better than the original base civ 5 game, it's finally a worthy successor to civ 4.  Too bad it took me so long to finally play it with all of the expansions, I highly recommend it."
15128,fun game
15129,I like that this game has more options and is more detailed than earlier versions.
15130,I love going to war with Ghandi and getting destroyed by him
15131,In the first week it became my second most played game. It's addictive and really a delight to play. :)
15132,its a good game. good for people with nothing to do and time to burn

This game is good. Especially with the expansions."

15140,"This is maybe the greatest 4x strategy game of all time. It is easy to learn and hard to master, and has great MP community. The DLC's add hundreds of hours of extra gameplay and the Mods are the absolute best. 10/10"
15141,"Within all my years, I've never found a game that I can truly love up until Civ 5. Many others had my same thoughts as the majority of the community still playing have thousands of hours as well. The only downside to the game atm is the lack of players. Games rarely last longer than medieval unless playing with friends. Online, it can take hours to find 6 people at certain times of the day and people frequently leave as well. Frankly, the multiplayer is in a bad place right now and I'd recommend finding a friend to play and grow with you before beginning. It made the process of learning 1000x better for me. Overall 8/10. -2 for RNG."
15142,honestly i dont know how i played this game for 50 hours i dont remember any of it. dont buy this game it sucks

15151,"i play spain, i win"
15152,"The best Civilization game to date! I personally believe it is better than it's successor Civilization VI. The units are highly detailed, and graphics are beautiful on the higher settings. Gameplay is long (but when isn't it in Civ) but in engaging; developing technologies, culture, are just as enjoyable as conquering another nation.

If you ever where thinking of playing a good strategy game, Civilization V is up with the greats,"
15153,"This game is the best civilization there is. Right when you think you have the world in your clutches Gandhi rolls up on you with his robotic death and requests you to be eliminated from existence. My knights stood no chance as he rolled upon my kingdom with the disappointment of a billion Asian fathers. I managed to quickly make a settler and post up in between some mountains that had amazingly 1 space available, but as I continued to build, so did Gandhi. It wasn't until 5 turns later that he had nuked me out of existence. 10/10 would highly recommend."
15154,Sid Meier's Civilization V is undoubtedly one of the best and most accessible 4X game available. I love it!
15155,"This is a classic, must play for anyone that didn't hate it when someone dragged Risk out of the game closet. One of my faves. And one day, maybe I'll play a game where I'm not the first to instigate war because someone managed to control an asset I had my eye on."
15156,yes
15157,It's kick ass
15158,yes
15159,"If you've ever wondered how much time you could sink into a game about random civilizations that you control, the answer is all of them. I've only been playing for about 100 hours now so as someone who has spent four days playing this I recommend it. Be anyone, anywhere, and try to win. Turn by turn play is great for the multitasker"
15160,good overall game
15161,Yes
15162,"great game with lots of replayability, great quick multiplayer game for you and your nerdy boyz"
15163,"Yep

My brother and I were unstoppable. An unshakable alliance. We conquered the Hawaiian's Empire and laid siege to its capital Honolulu. The shear beauty of the capital and area was breathtaking. I knew I was going to have this city for my Empire but unfortunately my brother desired the share for his Empire. There was many tense exchanges between our diplomats over who would take control of it. My brother threatened to nuke my civilization if I took over Honolulu before him. My Empire had the largest and strongest fleet with many nuclear submarines compared to my brother's empire. I need not worry. I took Hawaii's capital city and celebrated. Soon, Nuclear weapons hit Honolulu and annihilated everyone.

1/3 of my Empire lay in wastes to my brother's unforgivable act. I retaliated by decimating my brother's entire inferior navy and nuking all his cities with my submarines.

10/10 Would enter a cold war with my brother again!"
15164,"Ghandi pooped on screen, very epic"
15165,It's nice.
15166,good game you know
15167,yes better than civ 6
15168,A really good interpretation of the Civ genre. Still worth playing even after moving on to Civ 6!
15169,Its a fun a little about history while having fun.
15170,"It's great and worth the money 
"
15171,Best game to accidentally stay up all night rushing Nukes. 10/10 better than Civ 6
15172,"This game is one of if not the best TBS civilization building games that I have played so far. Civilization 6 would be the second best. The expansions are worth buying, but are not needed to have a great experience playing the game."
15173,"The hardest thing to do is save and quit game. Lots of hours and fun, a turn based masterpiece, simple and complex."
15174,Yes
15175,Digital crack. Play at your own risk!
15176,"Smart interface, effective tutorials, Visually interesting game with a lot of features to keep you engaged. I only wish the scenarios had a higher level of realism."
15177,"Beautiful gameplay, graphics are adequate, I like it better than VI."
15178,Needs BNW to really excel but the full package is one of the finest strategy games ever made. So much so that even now on its 3rd expansion you can't say that civ 6 is necessarily better and I still find myself wishing it was more like this game at times.
15179,Fun way to take over the world for a bit. Deep process required to take over in some of the non-military win methods.
15180,"The best strategic and nice game
"
15181,Civ
15182,"Addictive, fun, deep, challenging, atmospheric. I can't believe I played this for 144 hours lol."
15183,good fun. thanks.
15184,"Great game, hours of clicking fun!"
15185,I've never won a single game
15186,is game
15187,still my favorite
15188,I change my mind this game is shit. How many years and the AI and functionality of the game is still atrocious? Bruh what the fuck. I nearly have a thousand hours in this game so fuck you im right your wrong this game is dog shit
15189,"Insane game, super fun."
15190,Good game. Spend many hours playing.
15191,Perfect game to spend whole day on
15192,"Gandhi, Suleiman, Oda Nobunaga, Maria Theresa, the list goes on. 
Who are you going to trade, make declaration's of friendship, or a defensive pact with? Probably none of those civ's mentioned above (especially Gandhi) because you'll most likely be at war with almost everyone. 
But there will be those few civs that live across the world who will find you charming, wealthy and an overall cool leader and will help you prosper -- and then turn their backs on you once your empire gets bigger than theirs.

A lot of drama in this game and I love every second of it"
15193,excllent
15194,great strat game
15195,Playable i guess
15196,better than civ 6
15197,Very Fun
15198,its ok
15199,"Great Game, it's CIV... you should know that by now....  probably the best one... or maybe it's 2nd to Civ III...

better than 6 in my opinion...  

Go get it, why are you reading this?"
15200,better than VI
15201,you can wipe out entire countries with ganhdi
15202,"Great game, if you play it with human players. But there is no point in playing it against the AI, since there is a number of ways the AI civs cheat: they basically play a different game. For example, this ""happiness"" mechanic, which stops you from extending your civ too fast, exists only for the player. There is literally no ""happiness"" mechanic for bots. So if you play single-player, you'll see them building 1 or 2 new cities within the first 20 turns, while you'll have to wait for the 50th turn to buld your first new city, or else the ""happiness"" will ruin your economy. In the late game they'll have 20+ cities, which is impossible for the human player due to the same ""happiness"" mechanic. That is if you play on normal difficulty.
Once you find out about these things, you don't want to play against the AI ever again, since there is no fun in playing a rigged game, especially when you are aware of it."
15203,Civ V is probably one of the funnest games I've ever played. It's especially fun when you can get a group of friends to play with you. If you're into TBS games and this game is on sale then I highly recommend you buy it.
15204,Great strategy game
15205,One of first games I ever bought and will always be a favorite.
15206,very very nice. tons of fun
15207,"Engine smoother on modern PC.  I miss the older animations of the council, but they tended to drag a lot,"
15208,mongolia gang
15209,"Game is sick. Civ 6 is better, but Civ 5 is still juicy. 10/10 would play again."
15210,"Good game, fun even if you're bad which is kinda rare for video games"
15211,Ive enjoyed the civilization games since their inception. This version is particularly polished. Its replay value is high (wish it had cheat mode like the older versions). Trying to achieve the various methods of winning is fun. The core mix of diplomacy and strategy presents enough challenge and fun to keep this game intriguing over and over. Well worth it if you are into this style of game. Be fore-warned it can take a long time to build up your civ to win the game. Sometimes management of all your cities/workers/units etc.. can be a bit tedious. There is a newer version in the civ series you may want to check out before deciding.
15212,good
15213,"Relaxing world building, (although not as in detail as Mine Craft), chill game."
15214,cool game. idk how to play it but manipulating multiplayer lobbies over discord to do my bidding quietly is pretty sick.
15215,"Very immersive game. You feel all the development in your bones. Also, trying new civilizations with unique traits is always very joyful for me!"
15216,great game...
15217,"Good to play when bored, get nuked by Gandhi 9/10"
15218,8
15219,"Great stratefy game, amazing for new players and advanced long-term games."
15220,"all time great, the modern version of risk"
15221,q
15222,"fuck me 
"
15223,I cannot run the game nor view my library and nobody helps me. I have been playing Civ 5 for years and now I cannot run the game. What a ripoff!
15224,"Great strategy game
"
15225,Fun game if you love turn based hex games.  A little slow but fun nonetheless
15226,Great game but don't bother trying to build Notre Dame because the AI rushes to it like they don't know what happens to it if you hit the year 2019.
15227,Civ 5 is so much better in graphics and playing ability than six. I dont need or want built in politics in any game I play. This is a magor factor s well in 5 being better then 6
15228,"I had never played a game like Civ 5, though I had tried to with EU and Victoria- the idea of the 'interactive map game' was always one I liked since playing risk with my folks at Christmas, but before this game I always found them too hard to get into. Civ 5 is not like that- the skill floor is as low as knowing where the 'settle a city' button is on turn one. From that point on, the game is very good at teaching you the basics. 
But keep in mind that these are only basics, and what you learn from playing against Settler AI will not at all adequately prepare you for higher difficulties or PvP. The best way to learn how to play this game isn't simply to practice over and over, but to seek out guides created by players of advanced skill level, such as FilthyRobot's guides on YouTube.
This game has quite a few flaws. Firstly, if you are not familiar with our Latin alphabet (which you presumably are if you can read this review), the game's font won't support other scripts. Secondly, the game is quite poorly optimized for online play- disconnections and errors in world generation are fairly common, and only become worse the more players there are. Finally, with regards the difficult AI- honestly I don't bother turning up the in-game difficulty, but rather set limits on what I can do myself. Increasing the AI difficulty doesn't make the AI better, it just makes it cheat, and that's no fun for me. King level difficulty should be fine for most players with more than 100 hours. 
On a more positive note, this game is the perfect way to kill anywhere from three to twelve hours depending on what settings you use. The early game is by far the most enjoyable in my opinion, when you are first learning your place in the world and who your neighbors are, and when the barbarians are still a significant threat. Tensions rise in the mid-game as gunpowder weapons make their way onto the battlefield and the large coalition wars begin, and players set in stone the strategy they want to use to try and secure a victory. Finally, in the late game, players will begin to be knocked out of the running by nuclear wars and aircraft.
Most of the things I would add to or change about the game were added in Civ 6, but honestly that game has nowhere near the charm or longevity of its immediate ancestor. Games of Civ 6 are designed to be quicker, which is fine for those who prefer a shorter game but I think generally less appealing to fans of the 4x genre, who expect a game to last several hours."
15229,"
;'"
15230,"Probably the most replayable game I've brought, once you get the hang of it the game only gets better. Even if you lose you still feel like you've learnt something to take into the next game, an with all the different civ's you can play as you can create challenge after challenge for yourself. Could easily see myself clocking more then 100hrs on this game maybe even most played game for me... now if that doesn't say enough! Just watch out you'll lose your life to the game!"
15231,"Second best civilisation game, very fun for all ages and teaches history."
15232,good game
15233,"super amazing strategy, come and test your luck"
15234,funy rusia lady big bobs
15235,"Great multiplayer fun, when it works"
15236,"All Civilization games rock.  They are addictive and be cautious about time committed (it will get away from you, easily).  Game is great at giving multiple variants each time you play.  Enjoy."
15237,its fun
15238,Another great installment in the Civilization series!
15239,10/10 way better than 6 :)
15240,"Addicting, confusing at first though, i admit. Learning the game and how to optimally play it is half of the fun though! I had a lot of fun honing my civ skills against friends and AI's over time. It took me about 3-ish years to finally beat the deity(hardest) game difficulty sufficiently.

10/10
Wouldn't play civ 6 again."
15241,"I played a lot of this game, and loved it, but I recently tried to redownload to play w/ friends (because not everyone had/wanted civ 6) and the multiplayer was unplayable. We spent like 45 minutes and never started a game with everyone in it. The game just in general seemed unstable now :("
15242,Awesome game especially for price I got it.
15243,i think its fun but my friends usually never stay for the full game
15244,Hopelessly addictive
15245,"Every Civ fan has a favorite Civ version, and that's fine -- to each their own. For me personally, Civ 5 is the superior one. It is well balanced, with tons of content and different play styles, and a decent (though not perfect) AI. Very importantly, in its later versions, the game contains virtually no bugs. The key aspect that makes it superior even to Civ 6 is that it contains plenty of fun features without too much ridiculous, pointless, ""just because it's new""-type add-ins. Even years after its initial release, good ole 5 remains a complex game that is simple to learn, exceptionally fun to play, and always challenging (with the help of difficulty level adjustments and/or multiplayer). Additionally, there is the fact that advancements in hardware quality over the  years mean that even a fairly average modern system will run this game *great* on the highest settings."
15246,"good game, wish they updated it"
15247,very good game
15248,Almost as good as the original Civ
15249,poggers
15250,10 years on still really playable enjoyable game
15251,"My favorite game of all time. This game can be played alone, but i recommend you use the mods you want, and it's even more fun with friends. This game will be 100x better with the dlc, so definitely spend some extra money for the dlc, maybe wait for a sale. Overall fun factor, this game is a 10/10, and i would give it a 99% metacritic, only because you need to buy the dlc and they haven't made it free yet. BUY THIS GAME NOW!"
15252,"Very entertaining, wouldnt mind if this version was updated to better scenarios and different leaders, but overall a fun and addictive game."
15253,good
15254,its ok
15255,Pretty decent game ;)
15256,very nice game
15257,Good Game.
15258,e
15259,Is good
15260,"Civilization 5 was the first Civ game on which I spent a considerable amount of time playing. I probably have around 300 hours on it, when considering the offline time. It's a really great game, and with all of its DLCs, it has a huge amount of contents. Beating the AIs on the maximum difficulty is challenging, but also playing with and against friends is lots of fun.

With some friends, we once had a 24-hour 2v2 LAN in my old apartment, where we were constantly plotting against each other in secret. It was the best LAN I've ever had in my life, and we often still talk about how great it was and how we'd like to do the same with Civ 6.

I really recommend it to anyone who has a lot of time on their hands, and even people who are looking for a competitive experience can find what they're looking for by using mods such as NQMod (which I think has now been replaced with LekMod, but don't take my word on that) and playing in groups of dedicated competitive players."
15261,"great game
"
15262,Good
15263,"GOOD GAME I LIKED ALOt
"
15264,"is good i promise
"
15265,"Addictive as always, always  learning new  strategies !"
15266,"There comes a time in each era of humanity were it is evidently clear that unprecedented accomplishments have been made. on July 16th 1969 our species reached the moon, September 21st 2010 I can confidently say we surpassed that achievement. 

Whatever God or deity(s) you believe in, there's a pretty fair chance they in their infinite wisdom had a part to play in the development of this game. It was graced by it's holiness in the crucible of creativity and ingenuity and bewstowed upon mankind as a gift. 

For less than $8 you can control a wide array of historically significant civilizations and battle, influence, or delegate your way to victory one turn at a time. Play alone or with friends, quickly or slowly. Start in the ancient era or modern times, it matters not because in the end you will be having fun every step of the way. Build world wonders, or military units. Become wealthy or powerful, make friends or rivals. Play on random generated maps or pick pre-made ones. Play on large maps of 20 other factions or in a small cage match of 1 v 1. 

Here's whats going to happen Jimmy, you're going to buy this game. you're going to download it, you'll load it up, hear that music and pick a civilization you have some minor interest in, lets just say Rome for the hell of it. The learning curve isn't steep but there is one, your not sure what to do, you didn't do the tutorial. So you'll build a few warriors, maybe figure out that scouts can venture into the unknown farther, perhaps even fight some barbarians. You'll think to yourself ""eh this is kinda cool I guess"" but somethings going to make you keep playing, somethings going to be ticking in the back of your mind making you unable to stop or notice the time change. A few hours later, you got the general gist of the game down, you're making money, reached the medieval age and won your first war. You successfully took a city from a neighboring civilization and finalized it as part of your empire after making peace. You're going to keep thinking ""Just one more turn"" But it's not going to just be one turn....... It's never one turn Jimmy. It's getting late, you got school in the morning, you've been playing all day. But Egypt still has a few unconquered cities on your border.......... Those city states are really close to allying with you.... and say isn't your second largest city almost done building that world wonder? Maybe just..... one more turn. 

[Conclusion]
10/10 

"
15267,love killing barbarians with riflemen its pretty funny when they get 1 shot
15268,YES
15269,cooll
15270,great game.better than civ 6
15271,One. More. Turn.
15272,Best
15273,"My preferred game ever. It can improve your planning and observation skills, and is also quite enjoyable thanks to the several opportunities of acomplishment and reward, even when playing a single game. You can win from the first time you play without going deeper into learning all the details, and thru the years increase your knowledge and make victories more challenging and fulfilling. Totally recommend."
15274,Pretty good game with 2 main DLC.
15275,"I used to think that my erratic behavior and abuse of alcohol were what assisted in the degradation of my friendships, but now I know it was Civ V.  


yeah..."
15276,Easy to play and good fun! :)
15277,One of the best strategy games there is.
15278,就是玩儿
15279,"The creativity of the game is immense . Its ending ability is truely up to the individual player and not the 
paramiters of the games constrants."
15280,GGood plain fun for days in lockdown
15281,pretty cool havent played that much though
15282,"This game came with the Original Soundtrack on Steam but that has since disappeared. One of the highlights of Civilization as a franchise has been getting the music with each game. Not only has that content disappeared after being available on steam but as best I can tell the sound tracks that come with Civ VI are paltry by comparison -- the menu background music is very stirring yet completely missing, for example."
15283,"Bestest game wish they would update still instead of civ 6 :'(
Warning: this game will destroy your life you will literally waste hours, days, maybe even years of your life but in the end ghandi always wins...."
15284,"Very nice. It was a smooth transition from Civ III, and it's extremely fun for both SP and MP. Highly recommend the complete edition."
15285,Real reason to buy it is for the 5+ hours of music.
15286,pretty fun
15287,"Great time killer, if you love strategy and civ type games well, what u waiting for XD"
15288,Over 2000 hrs and counting. Love this game! They should have not created Civ 6 and just made more expansions for this game. What's that saying...? Don't fix what ain't broken? Definitely recommend this game for gamers of any level!
15289,fun
15290,
15291,great
15292,It fun
15293,The ultimate for me......have Civ 6 but still come back to his!
15294,Been a fan of the Civ games since Civ III. I would still go back and play the old ones.
15295,very fun so many units +nukes
15296,very pog game
15297,"Fantastic game, and very skill intensive."
15298,"This is one of the most enjoyable games I will continue to come back to. Every game is different, and its been a staple in my game collection. It works great still to this date, and trying to achieve different victories at different maps makes it unique every game."
15299,Just such a fun game with tons of replayability. I prefer Civilization 5 to its successor .
15300,Biggest vice ever. It's awesome.
15301,Positive words. Buy game!
15302,Great game
15303,gud gayme
15304,this is a very fun stategy game
15305,"Even now, Civ 5 remains one of the most thoughtful and exciting strategy games of all time. From the introduction of City-State mechanics to the departure of the ""Stack of Doom"" combat system, this game is a treat to play. If you're looking for a unique way to hone your critical thinking skills (at least at Deity or Immortal), this game is perfect for you."
15306,Just one more turn!
15307,"My dad used to kick my ass when we'd play this. I've grown up a little, and now I kick his ass every time.

tl;dr: good power trip"
15308,fuck persia
15309,mind blowing
15310,Best of the Civilization series by far
15311,The best turn based strategy ever made.
15312,"This is a good game. If you are considering buying this game I recommend buying the complete edition or whatever it's called when it's on sale (Though it's worth it anyways, it gets really cheap on sale). There are quite a few good mods, though the modding scene has slowed down a bit recently. Overall 10/10"
15313,"Played since I was in middle school. wonky mechanics, great game."
15314,its ok
15315,"Honestly, it's a really fun strategy game that just keeps you entertained (except the beginning it can be slow and hard to proceed but once you get the beginning out of the way, it gets alot of fun and way more interesting."
15316,ww2?
15317,"nice
"
15318,gandhi is mad
15319,I have played the game for a few years and keep playing it.
15320,"Great game, Has a few gamebreaking bugs like a worker unit stopping it's work midway through which is so annoying because it means you have to manually tell them what to do every turn until they complete the task (tasks like building a mine can take up to like 5 turns) which isn't what you want to be doing when Gandhi trying to annex Washington."
15321,"excellent just as the civ's before it
"
15322,Fun strategy game!
15323,V good
15324,"It is one of the best strategy games that I ever played! It might be difficult to learn at the beginning, yet once one learns who likes strategy and macro management games, it is addictive and superfun to play. After playing more than 300 hours, I now know how everything and every different civ works. At this point eveything starts to get repeatative and boring after a while, at least for me. Yet it is still fun to play with friends and great community :). I give thumbs up for the very fun 300+ hours!"
15325,"Amazing game, used to own it (not on Steam) and poured thousands of hours into this!"
15326,better than civ 6
15327,JUST ONE...... MORE...... TURN...
15328,"I loved how easy it was to get used to how the game works. I wish there were more nation options without having to buy extension packs though
"
15329,"The major reason I buy a game is the replayability, how many hours I can play in the game and if I'll get enough hours on it for the price. This game exceeds in that. 

Solid game, lots of fun."
15330,dood game much beter then civ 6
15331,better than civ 6????????????
15332,"I think Its just a chill game that you can just sit down and play
"
15333,just a great gameplay with plenty of options
15334,awsome!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
15335,Get ready to play a 16-hour board game only to lose in the last 45 minutes every time.  Excellent game
15336,10 years old today and still nothing compares to it.
15337,It's fun and if i have to wait to get civ 6 i well
15338,Best of the Civ series since Civ3 - Don't even try Civ6
15339,"control civilizations decide how history plays out will your country be victorious and stand the test of time or will it cease to exist. Great game, have had lots of fun and done many things I am not skilled but still enjoy tha game. Would say its worth the pick up 7.5/10"

15341,Its good
15342,The Best Civ game
15343,My favorite Civ game so far.

15355,Very good.
15356,is pretty fun tihi
15357,"such a masterpiece i love every minute of it
10/10"
15358,This is a great classic game that I have played for almost 1000 hours. Can't go wrong with Civ V.

15361,great addicting game lol
15362,"Great game, strongly recommend giving it a go."
15363,Best game franchise ever made.
15364,"pros: fun, easy to navigate, simple
Con: Can lag"
15365,"Even with Civ VI, this game is top notch. There is some great things to this game and with the mods that the community has put out, even years after the game was eclipsed with the newer version, this game stays fresh and interesting."
15366,"Good Game,  Once you learn the nuances of the AI, the game becomes more manageable."
15367,"bum rush nukes and you win, as is in real life"

15378,Very fun and time-consuming game.
15379,Oh boy this game ate a lot of my time. Highly recommend the CIv V world editor that comes with the game.
15380,Fine for baby's first strategy game but not really much depth
15381, .
15382,It's a Civ game.
15383,"Best game ever, and most realistic as well - each time I create my Christian empire I am being converted to Islam. We just need to have Spam Refugees mod and this will be 11/10. 

In case moderator would not get it, this is a joke *hint*, although the story is based on fact that happened in game, or maybe in a real life? Can't tell. Did I write this game is realistic?

Cannot recomment enough."
15384,Very good game
15385,"Yes, the game is worth every penny. Gameplay is fun, there is so much to discover. Warning: This game might consume your life. 21 hours in after two days of playing, one victory out of only two matches, I am properly addicted. I do not recommend this game if you have important things to do every day as this game will be in the back of your head like a drug. I currently am experiencing withdrawal symptoms. Perfect quarantine game! September 21st 2020."
15386,quite an intriguing game. better aesthetic than newer Civ games imo
15387,"Great Civ game... Need expansions (G&K at least) to add depth, but great overall."

15398,great version of game .. Better than civ 6 ..
15399,takes your sleep away...
15400,"I started my adventures in this series with Civ III. I got back into it with this one, Civ V. I really enjoy my time with this game. The random maps make it very replayable and there is so much going on, I love all the random alternative histories that play out. It might look a tad intimidating with all the buttons... but it is quite easy to learn (hard to master maybe). And failing can sometimes be just as fun as winning ^^
I can recommend it :D
Stumbled upon it in my steam library, figured it couldn't hurt to play a round and suddenly it was 2 AM. That 'just one more turn' feeling is real with this. :P"
15401,it's pretty good. Buy on sale with the dlc.
15402,Its Civ 5 its good
15403,this game has provided countless hours of fun for me and my friends. Nobody plays civ 6 so this game is still poppin

15408,"""One more round"""
15409,Well worth your money and time. one of the best 4x on the market.
15410,"Personal opinion on this game is that though it may be lacking some fun older civilization features like diplomats, spies, or armies, this game holds a great set of aspect that allow the player to have fun."
15411,yes
15412,Nice
15413,GG
15414,I can play it at my pace.  The game takes on different personalities every time I play it.  And it's a lot of fun.
15415,"This is by far one of the best games released during the 2010s'. It holds up as one of my favorite games even after playing for 5 years and logging more than 650 hours (150 hours on a different account). If you do get this game and enjoy it, I highly recommend grabbing the Brave New World expansion DLC."
15416,epic
15417,GG
15418,Just one more turn

15421,"is a great game, try the super power mod as well. then its even better"
15422,"After many hours, many playthroughs, and many hours of sleep lost. I can say with full certainty: Don't buy this game, it's good."
15423,"10/10 - Highly Recommended

I used to play Civilization 3 when I was younger. When I saw Civ-5, I was originally hesitant, honestly thinking it was not fun. Oh, how wrong was I! This game blends the original styles of play and modern changes to a period piece of strategic gaming. Battles need strategy, cities need proper attention, and every thing is on an edge of balance. The only variable is the player's ability to run the nation. This is a great way to play a game. Even when I get frustrated with the game, I do not hold a grudge. Because I know I can actually turn the tides at some point. Either that or drop the difficulty level for casual games. The game is seriously fun. If you enjoy strategy, the Civilization franchise, and nation-builders, give this game a play."

15429,It's an awesome game! My first civilization game and possibly one of the best!

15438,"There appears to be a memory leak that causes the game to behave oddly, and you have to use the task manager to end the task after a few hours of play.  Save often in case things go badly.

Otherwise, it is a fun game."

15440,Pretty cool.
15441,"Innovative, simple yet challenging, and very well thought-out in general. I enjoy the multiple win dynamics and the challenges that the different game modes bring."

15443,fun engaging game for a history junkie
15444,"To me this game is the best game in history, give it a chance the strategy is amazing."
15445,Best strategy game you can play on a low spec build. Civilization 5 might still be better than Civilization 6 in many aspects. Only get this game with the expansions. The game is incomplete without them.
15446,"It's a well known franchise so I decided to give it a go but I am extremely disappointed. It lacks atmosphere, it is painfully slow and units randomly lack sight and cannot fire at their intended range. Assaulting cities is more than difficult, moving around takes a lot of turns and even coming up with a worker means you have to sit around and press Next turn a lot. Stay away from this crap."

15462,swag
15463,"very fun, especially with friends"
15464,"Google ""Vox Populi Civ 5"" and install the community-maintained expansion which makes Civ 5 so much better than vanilla Civ 5 or Civ 6."
15465,This is the best out of the civ games. The new style of civ 6 is stupid and i highly recommend you don't play. The only thing i would say they need to change in this game is that the more city's you have the more unhappy your people are. Stupid rule seeing most people play this game with the conquer option as the winning goal. Other than that i have played this game on multiple computers in the ten of thousands of hours of game play.
15466,"This game became more sandbox than strategy.
If you like the monotonous management of minor things every turn, like in a sandbox, this game is for you.
If you like to solve more general and global things in this kind of strategy, then they are practically lost in the abundance of micromanagement every turn.

In the end, the game is very slow and meditative even in the fastest mode. 
You do dozens of the same type of repetitive actions just because of made-up management limitations.

Things which add to it:
- one unit per tile rule, no option to stack units
- one order one unit rule, no group selection to give one order to the group
- you can automate some units, but AI so lacking, that you out to manage them manually anyway (otherwise they will choose unprofitable paths, or build something with maintenance fee which you can't afford, etc.)
- building queue is present (if you look very hard for it), but limited and it is simply not convenient to manage it.
- one building buyout per turn, even if you have enough funds for multibuy

Aside from this you still get in-depth strategy that follows the tradition of the series and adds enough new features.

But due to the new slowing-down mechanics, I was not interested in playing it more than once. It's too tedious.
""Just one more turn"" still able to hook you in the process but after completion you don't want to repeat playthrough again.
The game has become too slow and too sandbox-inclined for my preferences."
15467,Sometimes in multiplayer near endgame the game starts chugging because it can't keep up with all the processes.

15481,"Really basic Sid Meier Civilisation game quite fun in most cases I enjoyed playing alone more than with friends due to how long it takes to play with friends and the game doesn't carry the hype on a game save for you to come back to which means almost all your games with friends will be left unfinished. Nevertheless, it is a very entertaining game."

15486,I've played more than 200 hours and just scratched the surface. What more is there to say?
15487,It's better than Civ VI

I wish I had no life, otherwise I'd play this till I drop dead.Also, the mods available for this game are the bomb."
15495,I like playing this game. I lose track off time while playing and I enjoy a game that can do that.
15496,"Gandhi made a deal to trade his chocolate with me then blew up one of my towns, 10/10"

15499,i havnt played this game but uhmmmmm im alowed to rate it? so yeah looks pretty cool
15500,"Fantastic game, but expansions are necessary. BNW and GK add game dynamics such as trade and religion that significantly enhance the gameplay."

15524,"Personally I'm not too much into strategy games like this. Bought this ages ago to play MP with my friends who LOVED this game for a whole whopping three days.

Still, its pretty solid. It's graphically pleasing, the music is alright. The game is easy to understand.
I was personally overwhelmed by the amount of playable leaders and all the additional mechanics that unfold while playing the game at first, but it more or less clicked a few hours in.

Overall, solid 6.5/10.
Nothing too fancy, but worth picking up in a sale"

15528,Its fun
15529,"I really recommend this game if you are new to strategy turn based 4x games, it has got a bunch of interesting features such as forming your own religion, ideology,  and army. It gives you a decent amount of basic play styles depending on each civilization, allowing you to be a war tribe, a diplomatic nation, a cultured papal state, or a civilization based around business and trade."

"
15531,10 years old and still holds up
15532,"After years of playing this game it still holds up to high standards and is far better than civ6 regardless of popular opinion. 

This game brought countless hours of fun and frustration at times and even though i have moved on to other games such as hoi4, coh2 etc etc... 

I always end up coming back for a game or 2 from time to time, it just proves (atleast to me) that this is a good game and worth my time and effort unlike most games we see these days."

15545,Great son
15546,This game is still worth playing in 2020. It's very different to Civilization VI. Make sure you're playing with the two expansions (G&K and BNW).
15547,i have 95 hours in the game and never finished one match.. 10/10 wouldn‘t want it any other way
15548,"good
\"
15549,Very playable
15550,"I may not have played all the earlier editions of Civ to tell if this one is the very best of them, but I've still enjoyed it thoroughly for what it is.

On the downside there's a lot of DLC's to buy to make it feel complete, and currently I wouldn't recommend buying them outside of a sale. There's also a few bugs, but none that I've found that would break the game entirely.
Compared to Civ VI and Beyond Earth, though, I would recommend this one any time over any of those."
15551,"I have been playing Sid's Civ family since 2002 starting with #3 and playing through #6.  This version, #5 has been my favorite."
15552,Civ IV will always remain my fav. But V is not bad

15558,It good
15559,"Not the best control system, and they don't really explain how to do the things they are recommending you do, but I still got sucked in to it."
15560,"I've played all the Civilization predecessors to this one and I have played the demo for VI.  Some times I think that a great game format can be made overly complicated and that's the way I felt about VI.  Hence why I keep coming back to this version time and time again.  The graphics are spot on and the mechanics are just right for my type of game play.  I still cannot believe that I have racked up more than 850 hours on this game, but that just shows you how good it is.  Something you can mess around with in the background whilst you are doing something else."

15593,"This game is great, it's a classic game to sit down with friends on a rainy weekend and grind out a Huge map against Level 8's.

But recently the game was ""updated"" and it is now impossible for someone on a Mac to play with someone on a PC. The developer claims the ""update"" was for performance reasons, but nothing was wrong with the performance prior to the ""update"". I logged over 300 hours in Civ5 playing with friends on Windows, and never had any issues. Now I can't play with them at all. 

I'd say the real performance problem is that I bought this game able to play with my friends, and now I can't."

If you like long term games where what you do early game determines your situation later game, or you have ADD (not ADHD) and can hyper focus for six hours at a time, I would highly recommend this game. Also getting the brave new world dlc makes this game a lot easier in terms of money management because it adds trade routes as a game mechanic, and most of the npcs don't use all of them so you'll just have more money than every other civilization (except Venice). Also wait until one of the seasonal sales to buy the game. It's WAAAYYY cheaper. you can get the game and all of the DLC for a total of like $12-$20."
15625,it great

I always have loved this kind of game and this one runs pretty smooth on my (4gb ram no graphic card to speak of) PC.

15642,easy fun game to pass time
15643,美丽新世界把游戏质量整体提升到了一个新的高度
15644,Digital heroin 10/10
15645,It good
15646,"Oldest game i have, pretty fun."
15647,definitely recommend to anyone who loves simulating war games.
15648,Nice game. Especially with friends. Do NOT play Alexander though unless you want an easy win ;)
15649,you cant not play this game youd be missing out
15650,gud
15651,Still better than VI.
15652,"WITH mods?=play all day
WITHOUT mods?=obnoxious and heck no.
Do yourselves a favor and download the no happiness mod and the burger king civ mod and you got yourself a way more exciting game. Do NOT play this game without the happiness mod because you spend the whole game worrying about if you can even expand at all.
Also the AI diplomacy will make you want to bash your skull against your computer monitor when you want one of their luxuries they are gonna want fucking 35 gold per turn, two of your luxuries and your first born child JUST to get ONE resource you want. 
Not to mention that without mods, the AI never declare war on each other and will sit around for hundreds of turns. Do yourself a favor and get one of the many AI aggression mods and the game will be much more enjoyable. 
I could go on for hours about the game and what is good and bad but long story short, get the game on sale and repeat the steps above and you got a pretty fun game. 
Humble opinion... Civ 6 is WAY worse of a game then this, get this game FIRST if you are trying to decide between both Civ 5 and Civ 6."
15653,Lots of different ways to play.
15654,"A solid addition to the SM:Civ franchise. It's entertaining, delightfully time-consuming, and occasionally thought-provoking. While it doesn't quite hold a candle to other Sid Meier games like Alpha Centauri, (aside from better graphics) I can't help but thoroughly enjoy it each and every time."
15655,i LIKE CIV V BETTER THAN CIV III OR CIV VI
15656,"Out of all the addictions I see my therapist for, this game is my favourite."
15657,"It's just so enjoyable, but you may lose track of time
"
15658,9/10
15659,awesome game
15660,nice          ^
15661,"Attack every civ or city state you see, I promise it will work out."
15662,"i love it, highly reccomend"
15663,Extremely fun
15664,this game is so addicting!
15665,house mates wouldn't bumrape me if I played this game with them so for me it's two thumbs up (not up my bum)
15666,why are you looking at the reviews of this old a game
15667,"Very robust and fun game, 9/10 (point deducted for all the arguments playing Civ has caused amongst my friends)"
15668,its fucking Civilization
15669,"Very good game to play alone or with friends.

What can i say except that this game is a true timeless masterpiece.
Overall balanced gamplay, lots of options to customize your playthrough, accurate representations of the real world, astonishing interactions with fellow player OR AI.

The only downsides to this game come with the age of it.
Sometimes the game will crash at the end of turns (multiplayer)
Sometimes the game will be clitched out and stuck at the barbarian turn (multiplayer)

And if you want the full experience you have to buy all the DLC. 
This is not too hard since 3rd party websites sell the keys for a small price compared to the store itself.

Recommended for single and multiplayer alike"
15670,It was fun
15671,fun
15672,"Still my go-to game when it comes to strategy, would recomend adding few mods for more win-conditions"
15673,"I absolutely LOVE this game, I've had so much fun playing this with my brother and friends, its provided me with endless entertainment since it came out in 2010. Probably my favorite game of all time!"
15674,"Amazing strategy game with plenty of content to learn new techniques and strategies. Fun with friends but equally fun without, although the AI can get very predictable."
15675,"I just keep coming back to this game, and I'm not generally a fan of strategy games. It's easy to learn, but it has all kind of details if you want to go into it a little deeper. I would recommend everyone to get at least the first expansion to the game though, as the base games combat system/randomiser can feel unfair. Shifting from 10 HP total for all units to 100 makes it a lot better, and the randomiser a lot less harsh."
15676,Really addicting. That's all I can say.
15677,fuk yea
15678,Quite possibly the greatest game ever made.
15679,one of the best games i have ever played
15680,it aight
15681,This is more addicting than crack.
15682,good game
15683,great game if your a person whose down to burn days to weeks in a prettier version of multi chess or a chill turn based game it handles both. Great to play with friends online or solo offline vs AI.
15684,One of my faves!!!
15685,Civ 5. Nuff said.
15686,GREAT GAME.
15687,Just played Gal Civ III. It was nothing but lines and dots. Civ V (any Civ) has gameplay and graphics. the short and sweet.
15688, good game 10/10
15689,gud
15690,Civ 5 is a good game
15691,My wife left me for paying attention to this game more than our marriage.
15692,"> le be me
> play this computer game for 45 hours (Whoa! that's a lot!!!)
> get asked personally by the staff of Steam to leave a review of the game
> Click ""Yes"" as a recommendation
> use extensive knowledge of comedy and comment ""it's okay"" as a description
> wait for people to message me thank you's for recommending such a fun game :>
> watch family guy in my pitch black room in my windowless studio apartment, the TV being the only light that i own"
15693,"My favorite part is when I liberate a civ that was wiped out and they denounce be next turn, 10/10"
15694,"amazing
"
15695,Best Civilization game that i have played atleast
15696,me arese
15697,"fun
"
15698,"Hell yes! There's so much content in this game, the music is amazing, the gameplay is wonderful if you're into these strategy type games!

Multiplayer is very glitchy and tends to crash a lot but more often than not, it'll work fine. Usually glitches out when you have more than 2-3 people and someone has connection issues.

Other than that, the mods people have made for this game can completely revitalize it. There's so much!"
15699,"This is still my most played game even though I haven’t really played in the last 3 years (been playing VI for my Civ fix). Even though the sucessor improved on a lot of points, this does not erase the fact that CiV is a great game for any fan of 4x."
15700,good game
15701,"this game is soooo gay and gameplay wise doesn't really have anything to do with civ building, history, or strategy. only fun to make your friends mad by spamming op strats that make no sense"
15702,
15703,"10/10 Best intro to CIv and any 4x strategy game. Have fun rewriting history as many times as you want and embracing the M E M E S. Now if you'll excuse me, I need to revive Rome once again..."
15704,"Honestly this game is amazing, even 10 years later. while Civ VI is fun in it's own right. this is the ultimate version of Civ in my humble opinion."
15705,cool
15706,Great game!
15707,This game was great until the update which took away cross platform play. Big thumbs down for that
15708,gud game
15709,A great way to escape this world and make your own!
15710,it good
15711,its diggity dope
15712,"It is a great God game, it is slow for the player with time."
15713,nuke everyone 10/10
15714,It's kinda fun I guess
15715,"Was alright, is alright.
"
15716,Wouldn't Play Solo but its really good with friends.
15717,based
15718,"This game is amazing.
Even if you own civ 6, this game still stays worth playing because of its very different art style and gameplay."
15719,Great game lots of fun!
15720,"it was so cool
"
15721,"sid meirir more like sieve maja
!!!"
15722,This is the best civ game that they ever made. Civilization 6 was a step backwards in that they introduced multiple complex systems that did not improve gameplay but added significant tedium.
15723,Do you have 10 hours to micro manage your trade routes to belgrade? No? Don't play then.
15724,Best civilization game from the series of civilization
15725,great game and easy to play
15726,I love this game and I have played it a lot but I have developed arthritis and all that mouse activity means that I'm going to have abandon one of my favourite pastimes. It would help if the game's menu system allowed keyboard navigation but t doesn't so I suppose that's that for Civ 5 and me.
15727,Is really really really good guys
15728,"Like Civ 4: Beyond the Sword, the game didn't work with Win10,
despite attempting the following fixes:
checked firewall, verified files
reinstalling and updating: game, DirectX, drivers, Steam
running: in compatibility mode, as administrator, in window-mode, turning off anti-aliasing, running as Legacy (which didn't work as intended)
(sidenote: if the game actually did work, I imagine the launcher commercials would become a nuisance quickly)
EDIT: Waiting on my refund request to be approved."
15729,Epic Game!
15730,"I'VE PLAYED 666 HOURS,  i LIKE IT BETTER THAN CIV6

15731,THE GAME
15732,it is a very good game
15733,The best game.
15734,"He's got a nuke. It's the fifth one this week, and it's only Monday!"

15736,5d chess
15737,"swag

15738,very nice
15739,The best of the bunch with all the great addons. Better than the 6!
15740,"simple, yet fun. like playing with friends
"
15741,"Love the graphics, the gameplay and the everything else!"
15742,"FUN, ENGROSSING, NOT TOO HARD"
15743,fun
15744,Great game up to level 4. After level 4 the game cheats so bad it makes the game no fun. I guess you could say  I just suck but I do not think that is the case. I would call it a bad example of game making.
15745,Civ 5 is one of my more loved games of the series perfect for some time off to just chill and play anyway you want relaxing or otherwise a good choice to burn some time now-a-days.
15746,Best Civ yet
15747,"Classic Masterpiece, I hope it sets an example for what games could be"
15748,
15749,"Always good for a few hours of entertainment, but make sure you set a timer or you'll loose 8 hours before you know it."
15750,Good game
15751,V GOOD
15752,good enough for government work
15753,good
15754,This game is very fun until you realise you don't speak to your wife and kids for five months because you were too preoccupied by this fucking game. Then you get divorced and your wife takes the kids. Overall a good 9/10.
15755,The odd number Civ games are the best.
15756,Better than Civ 6
15757,great game
15758,it is not  review. dont like popupsh sugestion for review)))
15759,Nothing like leaving Nuclear fallout at 1500BC... 10/10 realistic world simulator
15760,pretty fun
15761,"This game is the worst game of all time, I wouldn't spend more than a minute playing it."
15762,The Best of Civ games
15763,"Love it, love it, love it, love it, love it. Nothing much else to say really"
15764,"For me, this is by far the best Civ game, ever. I really tried enjoying Civ6, but no. I didn't like it."
15765,what to say? its civilization - its never been bad
15766,Beware! Addictive material.
15767,Best game of a great series in my opinion.
15768,This is the best game Ive ever played
15769,its ok
15770,cool
15771,Love this game and glad it still works being 10 years old.
15772,"I first started playing this game in 2015 and have played over 1000 hours since then. The complexity of the game, the wealth of information and leader choices, and multimedia content spanning the course of human history make it endlessly fascinating. My  teen-age daughter and I really enjoy playing against each other as well."
15773,One of the best turn based strategy games I have eve played.
15774,Great Game
15775,"






great game played it for hours. love it."
15776,"This game is truly something else. You could loose yourself in all the glory and enlightenment that comes with making your own civilization. The music, fun quotes, diplomacy with other civilizations will all have you telling yourself, ""Just one more turn..."". What more could be said about this masterpiece that hasn't already been said? Granted it's not everyone's cup of tea. There is a lot to do and a lot to learn, but if you are a history buff you will find plenty to enjoy in this masterpiece. Veni, Vidi, Vici!"

15794,"its civ
"
15795,Watch as your friends forever lose trust in you after you obliterate the empire they've been trying to build all game because they stole a gem tile you wanted. If you have a fetish for raising massive armies to unload on an unsuspecting pal across the ocean like me then you'll have a grand experience.
15796,good
15797,good
15798,"The textures including the soundtrack in Civ 5 are decent. Find it's more playable in some regards compared to Civ 6. If you can be bothered wasting a day or two taking over the world with strategy similar to playing Chess, then this is definitely the best prime recommendation for an addition to your games library."
15799,chance of macro politics with abit megalomania...
15800,at least decent
15801,Fantastic game.
15802,good game. lost track of time
15803,"I have always like Civ and it keeps getting better as I get older, now am 69.
"
15804,Dis a good game.
15805,Civ 5 is by far one of the best Strategy games I have played. I recommend this game to anyone who has the patience and want to built massive empires from scratch with military cunning and diplomacy.
15806,yes
15807,"I really enjoy this game, but I cannot play it anymore. The new launcher is buggy and crashes constantly and does not even fully crash when it does so I have to go into task manager and find it hidden under background processes and kill it before steam will allow me to relaunch it. There is no reason for this new launcher its simply stupid, 2K should have kept the old one.

On top of this I cannot play the game even if I get past the launcher because the game does not respond once it launches. It plays the intro, but does nothing and once its over nothing happens.

Cannot recommend because it is just not playable, its always been a buggy game, but before at least I could play it. Very disappointing"
15808,yes
15809,This game is very good.
15810,"glizzy

15811,Great game easy to play and so many ways to win
15812,as great as everyone says it is
15813,"Tense and strategic, yet relaxing and nice aesthetics. I love the historical and artistic aspects to this game. I can spend a whole day playing this and not be bored. The graphics look good even on the lowest settings."
15814,Daft
15815,Still one of my favorite games!
15816,Great game
15817,awesome game. dlc makes it even better
15818,Good
15819,A fun game once you get the hang of it
15820,I haven't played Civ in about 10 years. When I last played it was Civ IV. I feel like Civ V takes me back to that time frame with some improvement to game mechanics. I felt for this was a good buy when considering the price that included all the DLC.
15821,Awesome
15822,Nukes
15823,amazing
15824,great
15825,would i recommend the best civ game ever? hell yes civ 5 is better then 6 in all rights.
15826,I guess after 1500 hours of gameplay that I can approve of this game just one more turn...
15827,great game
15828,"add mac pc crossplay back

15836,It's ok.
15837,Fun and cool
15838,*insert generic pun about Ghandhi here*
15839,awesome
15840,"A great game. Lots of depth and with a huge skillcap. The more you play the better you get at the game. Expansions totally worth it. Sometimes there are some balance issues when it comes to PVP but a little bit of democracy will have you adding personal voted rules to fix all of that easily, and then a whole new game is born everytime. Little details matter a lot. If you love crushing your enemies through the power of your meticulous minmax or through sheer game knowledge this is a game worth hundreds of hours with quite a lot of online presence. A really fun early game, a challenging and strategic midgame where your choices will entirely dictate the whole game, very little luck involved. A very rewarding endgame where PVP feels like a a tense Cold War right before the World War inevitably pops up, leading to the end of history, civilization and the game."
15841,I can't stop nuking the French
15842,Its still the best Civ game
15843,"It's my childhood game 
why wouldn't I love it?
I still have the box set and the dvd of it 
(bought the game of the year edition)
:DDDD"
15844,"Its Civ, its timeless, it holds up incredibly well. Get Brave New World to improve the late game."
15845,Better than civ 6
15846,a
15847,"One of theese games which cannot be touch by the time, endless replayability"
15848,"fav game
"
15849,good
15850,good for burning time
15851,"Game doesn't come with campaigns. They are locked through dlc's. If you need campaigns to get hooked like me, buy the Complete Bundle for the savings.. Since I don't think the bundle itself can go on sale and it's significantly cheaper than getting dlc's individually, even if on sale."
15852,"Among the best turn based strategy games out there. Get the game when both it and its' dlc are bundled together on sale, they make Civ 5 infinitely more replayable."
15853,Fun game. Used to play a pirated version of the game when I was younger. Thought I'd buy the game for all the fun times it provided.
15854,its ok
15855,good game
15856,Better than chess
15857,"More realism in both your characters and your graphics; more  than VI.

15858,"good strategy game, even better with friends"
15859,Yes good
15860,nice
15861,The best of the series. Get's even better with the community Patch Vox Populi!
15862,Its Civ 5 homie.
15863,yes
15864,This game is unreal
15865,"Better than Beyond Earth, more fluid"
15866,Just awesome
15867,"It's a older game but great to play and take over the world. It needs some work on diplomacy that version 6 is supposed to improve on. The game play and controls are good. Speed of calculating other country's move gets a tad slower later in the game, but it's expected."
15868,good game much fun
15869,Best turn based strategy ever
15870,very fun game
15871,i dont like this game !! it sucks !!
15872,digital heroine
15873,"Strategic nation-state builder, with tactical employment of forces alongside research and diplomatic responsibilities. Improvement over Civ4 regarding non-stacking of units, which really creates a chess-like environment for unit movement. Well balanced mechanics, decent graphics and excellent quantity of civilizations and cultures to play as in the complex battle to be the #1 civilization on the map. Multiplayer is also one of the best highlights of this game! It feels like board-game night at my house with friends who hopefully stay your friends as you forge secret alliances to stab each-other in the back all while preparing your AI partners to engulf the world in a full scale conflict of epic proportions!... except that one friend you have who wins by diplomacy or science while you all kill eachother. But that win doesn't matter! You're here for the slaughter-fest and you know it. Enjoy the game guys!"
15874,"I highly recommend this game because, it's fun, topical, and historic. It makes me think a lot about history and development as a human race. It's really fun although kind of time consuming. However, there is a quick game mode. And lots of extra content to enjoy."
15875,god game
15876,
15877,Yes
15878,Best Civ of all 6
15879,"Шикарная игра! классика жанра. Рекомендую однозначно. Новаторства 6й части мне как-то особо не зашли с неубиваемымми апостолами и тд. История подсказывает что еретиков и прочих проповедников успешно устраняли силовыми методами во все времена и в любом месте.. но впрочем это 6я часть, а 5я очень хороша!"
15880,"This is easily one of the best games on the market. For the game plus all DLC, the price is quite low. During sales, it is ludicrously low and you would miss out by not buying it. Gameplay is highly enjoyable and replayable. There are so many settings, maps, and civs that you always have some new combination to try out, so it never gets old. The modding community is also excellent for this game, and there is a massive array of mods that change the game in myriad ways. All in all, it is a great purchase and will give you lots of happiness for years."
15881,Its ok I guess.
15882,Too funn
15883,"One of the best strategy games of all time. There is nothing else that can be said. This game is still leaps and bounds ahead of games coming out today. Hell, its leaps and bounds ahead of its own sequel. If you have never played this game, you are missing out."
15884,Awesome Game!
15885,"after 1722 hours i can say you will fall in love with this game, peace out"
15886,Pretty tight
15887,The strategic and minute control of the factors of gameplay is my favorite part.
15888,iTS PERFECT
15889,dope
15890,This game literally got me a 5/5 on my AP-World History test
15891,"*comment about how gandhi is a back-stabbing son of a bitch*

On the real though this game is so much better than Civ 6. It is a night and day difference. This is the best Civ game to date and especially fun with a group of friends."
15892,"Overall, I think CiV V has the best balance between graphics, gameplay, and fun level.  It's in depth, without being too complicated, and is a joy to play.  Of the Civilization series, V is right up with II for innovation, but still keeps the feeling of Meier's original masterpiece."
15893,"What is there to say about Civ V?
I like the art, the soundtrack, somewhat enjoy the board game combat. This is what makes me forget what a shallow, dumbed down game with horrible incompetent AI it is. I can go on and on pressing next turn to get the next wonder painting, music fragment or city conquered. 
At the end of the day I had(currently every game is the same, I can do the same thing every game and win on Emperor even Immortal) a lot of fun with it.
All in all I would recommend it for its soothing effect but don't expect a rich strategy experience here. For that you need to go to the best game in the series... the previous installment."
15894,A classic
15895,It's good. Play with the homies.
15896,"Great strategy game to play with friends, but make sure to pick up all the DLC with the base game, as the vanilla experience isn't nearly as good as the full version. At the very least, pick up the Gods & Kings and Brave New World DLCs, as these better balance the game and add a bunch of new features, such as religion and new civilizations to play as."
15897,"Lots of replayability. A little on the simple side, but lots of fun."
15898,"this game has ethiopians and zulus n shiet

good

87/100"
15899,"I haven't played the newest one, so I can safely say this is the best CIV so far. Patience required."
15900,Litterly My Favorite Strategy Game.
15901,I like it because it is fun
15902,so fun
15903,"HEY!  You lazy turds need to make the LAN games work.   Love the game, though.
"
15904,"This game is addicting, don't play if you want a happy, healthy lifestyle and don't want a crippling addiction."
15905,"Objective | 86%
Subjective | 80%

Graphics are amazing. Fits 21:9 aspect ratio. High skill ceilings for those interested in mastery.

Overall, good game to get if you prefer a classic civlisation experience over Civ VI."

15918,Sick for nerds
15919,"Civ is a time sink, but it's a time sink that I love. One more turn? You bet.

500 hours+ and I'm not bored yet. (I take screenshots every so often to belabour my addiction to my husband)

Honestly, I'm sure I've (unintentionally) learnt more history and geography than I recall from formal education by playing this game. I highly recommend this game to any strategy lovers - from casual games to intense micro management, you can play any way you want.
"
15920,"excellent game, loads of fun, well worth the money"
15921,genial!
15922,"nm,.jklllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllll"
15923,The only issue with this game is how difficult it is to pull yourself away from it.
15924,Best stragety game ever
15925,Nice
15926,"Amazing game! I had never played the game until about a month ago but now i'm completely hooked. only down side are the headachs that come after multiple hours of having my eyes and mind glued to the screen, lol! I had played the c&cs and the AOEs. I also enjoyed the game starcraft a lot. however i always found myself wishing the games could be more in depth with a Risk type feel on a whole new levle. In closing, Civ v is everything i was looking for and more. Cant wait to try Civ6. would absolutely recommend this game to any and all who love RTS style games and ach for a deeper more emersive game. Civ v has it all!"
15927,This game is so boring
15928,"its okay
"
15929,It's a great game!
15930,"This is my favourite strategy game of all time as can be seen by the number of hours I have devoted to it. I have played all Civilisation games from Civ1 to Civ 5 and I also have Civ 6 but I have not played it much. Civ 5 is the best of all the previous Civ games. Playing the Civ 5 Brave New World expansion and having all 43 civilisations to play makes for a wide variety of options when selecting a civilisation to play as each civilisation has a unique advantage and 2 unique military units and/or buildings which add a bit of flavour to each game.  Each civilisation has a historical leader that is programmed to behave differently to other leaders with some leaders being more friendly while others are more aggressive, some are more competitive in chasing certain victory types of which their are five, culture, domination, science, diplomacy or time. The game commences in 4000 BC and concludes when one civilisation achieves one of the victory types, or 2050 AD is reached when the civilisation with the highest score achieves a time victory. The game is undemanding on graphics cards but playing the game on higher complexities and on huge maps pushes both the CPU and RAM as the game progresses towards its conclusion. CIV 5 has many mods available, one of which has a huge earth map where up to 22 civilisations can be selected to play in their real life historical starting positions which I enjoy playing. The game has several fansites, the one I use is civfanatics.net and I also like to compare my performance with other players by comparing my results with theirs at hof.civfanatics.net/civ5/index.php  I am not an expert but I enjoy the game all the same. Games can last from 20 minutes to many hours depending on size of map, number of opponents and difficulty of which there are 8 settings. I always play solo against computer AI's playing the other civilisations but I believe multiplayer online is available
If you enjoy strategy games, have lots of time available, like working through technology trees to advance your civilisation and you don't have anything better to do with your spare time, this could be the game for you. I probably paid full price for all the add ons and DLC for this game when it first came out, but if you can pick it up on sale, you might even save a dollar or two.
This is my first games review written in a period of indecisiveness during covid19, trying to pick a new civ5 challenge, or maybe I should try playing a different game."
15931,its Sid Meier. Nothing more needs to be said.
15932,"It's fun, challenging, and immersive, as a single player or multiplayer game."
15933,lolol
15934,love it great time killer
15935,Buy it on sale
15936,authoritarian ghandi like youd never believe it

15942,Yay
15943,It's highly addicting and can be played for long periods!
15944,LIT
15945,it is a lot of fun. I enjoy how each game is different and how you can modify the game in many ways.
15946,So many ways to play; never becomes tiresome.
15947,Great fun to replay as different leaders
15948,It's great like Frosted Flakes
15949,nice game

15951,"Sid Meier's Civilization V is a dynamic, strategic and addictive turn based game.

I just keep getting driven back to it! With a modding community alive and kicking out new content along with some Developer released updates giving this game edge and replayability that I will return to and have over the years.

Recommend for anyone that loves strategy."
15952,Ai suck
15953,A very fun game for casual players and history buffs alike. This is the type of game that you shouldn't take too seriously. It is amusing to see these historic titans act completely out of character.
15954,Not enough information to judge. I'll play some more hours and get back to you with whether I could wholeheartedly recommend it or not.
15955,"Just an awesome game
"
15956,Awesome!!!
15957,Game makes grins
15958,its super old but i still love it
15959,"Good game, the old ones are always fun."
15960,"I love the mechanics, and the pace and the customisability of the game set up."

15969,You will love it
15970,"really addictive maybe the best in the civ series but definitely some balancing issues
"
15971,"if you don't count the time it took for turns to go by, I've actually played for like 100 hours"
15972,"Worthy of many, varied replays.  Great game."
15973,its a fun game
15974,best game ever
15975,"I love the detail and replayability value of the game as a whole. If you're a fan of strategy/territory type games then this is one for you. 

My only (very small) gripe is that the diplomacy aspect of the game doesn't seem very sensitive to informal alliances, with longtime allies very quick to brand you a tyrant even if you're acting in the shared interest

Note: I received this game for free as part of a student laptop purchase."
15976,It's okay I guess.
15977,Great strategy / empire-building game.  Very addictive.  Can be a bit clunky at times though but generally is very good.
15978,"Buggy, crashes... sucks"
15979,"this is the best
"
15980,Just crashes after a few turns of playing. Useless
15981,i like all aspects
15982,this makes my pe pe hard
15983,It's Civ.
15984,Fun way to waste hours of your life if you like turn based strategy games.
15985,cool
15986,fun game
15987,good game it gets funner the longer you play
15988,missed the sunset and sunrise after one game
15989,I love it. Civ is the only video game for me.
15990,Fun.
15991,better than civ 6
15992,"Now this is the Civ you want to own and play - CIv VI is worthless, DO NOT PURCHASE Civ VI"
15993,"I have played the Civ games since the first one. This one I prefer. The earlier ones may be somewhat more enjoyable in certain aspects, but the hexagon trumps all that. 
Then again, nothing but graphics in the newer ones is better than in Civ V. 

Awesome game."
15994,"Honestly one of the most entertaining games ive played, its an easy game to take a break from and return and still enjoy it as if you had just gotten it. All in all a game id recommend!"
15995,I love this game. I've been hooked on this Turn Based Strategy Series ever since I came across Sid Meier's Civilization Revolution on Xbox 360. The games can be pretty long at times depending on your play style. I own Civilization VI as well and I think I might actually enjoy this one more.
15996,Superior Civ game
15997,aaaa yiiiiii
15998,game
15999,"So I look at the clock, 8pm, I'll do a few more turns before I get ready for bed. Like 1 or 2 turns max go by, look at the clock...2am. Every. Single. Time. 10/10 will do again tonight."

16017,"Epic strategy  and tactics,, AI stronger"
16018,"So far I've played 298 hours and have not tired of this wonderful strategy game. Still have a great deal to learn about it, but that's part of the pleasure. Perfect for the otherwise boring hours spent under ""lockdown"". A real treat that rewards the time spent seeking ways and means of beating Civ V's AI."
16019,Play the game with friends or u will get bored

16023,time is a human illusion
16024,I love this game.
16025,Awesome game. One of my all time Favorites.
16026,"love it.
"
16027,There's a reason I've only played this for 20 hours.  The reason is that it takes 10 hours to play a regular match.  Is the game fun? Sure. Are the graphics cool? Sure.  My recommendation is a soft yes but wait until it's on sale.
16028,"This is a game that's really fun, strategic, and time consuming. It is a game I really enjoy and believe other people would find a great game too."
16029,nice game with a historic feeling others cant seem to recreate.
16030,Civilization games are classically addicting.
16031,It takes your mind off life's troubles
16032,180 hours in and I'm STILL learning the mechanics of the game. Play on settler for a while until you feel like you can challenge yourself more.
16033,big pog
16034,"Extremely overrated and lacks depth. Diplomacy is severely lacking with leaders lacking any semblance of personality and soul. Not being able to go wide is a head scratcher. Why should my empire only consist of a few cities? Makes no sense. Game is extremely lacking when it comes to player agency which turns the game into a click end turn minigame. Sid Meier's Alpha Centauri is the best TBS ever made, if you want to play a good TBS then go with that."
16035,Guns vs. Butter! I started playing wayyyyy back with Civ (the original) & enjoy building my empire.   (maybe to much)
16036,really fun and hard on the harder settings
16037,"One of the best games I've ever played. It's kind of like club penguin, but if instead of penguins you're a dictator that lives over 3000 years, and instead of being on the northpole you're in a fertile earth simulated planet that quickly turns into a nuclear hellscape once you realize that the only option left for victory is to nuke everyone else because you spent too much time building longswordmen instead of feeding your people."
16038,amazing game
16039,It's pretty alright
16040,"Amazingly fun game but don't let it distract you from the fact that in 1998, The Undertaker threw Mankind off Hell In A Cell, and plummeted 16 ft through an announcer’s table."
16041,!
16042,"A great game if you have ever wondered if bill and ted could have changed the timeline for all factions throughout time could compete and fight each other. 

Party On!"
16043,The more people playing the better. Good for long blocks of space you want to kill.
16044,I do not know how to play this game
16045,"Fun and enjoyable, I sound like a bot."
16046,"I doubt anyone is planning on buying it after a decade, but I find it much easier to get into than the complicated CIV 6 and the stories made and the concepts mastered and always fresh approaches that arise are still fresh after over 100 victories.  It's an adult version of Legos to me at least."
16047,gr8
16048,Fun game if you want to rule the world
16049,Best CIV I've played so far
16050,I think this version is way better than version VI.
16051,yes
16052,WOULD YOU BE INTERESTED IN A TRADE AGREEMENT WITH ENGLAND
16053,"It's fun, satisfying, and easy to learn"
16054,One of my favorite games of all time. Nice blend of 4X mechanics without being overly complex.
16055,Just... one... more... turn....
16056,I have other newer games but I always come back to this bad boy because it's really good
16057,gggggggggggggggggggg
16058,"Fun lots to learn always fresh
"
16059,Perfect 5/7 would get nuked by Gandhi again.
16060,"Super addicting & fun, would recomend to anyone."
16061,Very good turn based nation builder game
16062,It's a fun game and it's cool to play with some homies. A friend gifted it to me a few years ago and it's been a fun game.
16063,awesome
16064,"Is it better than CIV 6, no. But, it does have many expansive mods to play with"
16065,hmmmmm
16066,civ
16067,"Civ V was the first Civilization game I played and it is still one of my favorite strategy games to this day. I will spend an entire day on one game and still not complete it, but it never feels like a drag.  Anyone who does not feel like a strategy genius can still enjoy this game, as the mechanics on the surface seem quite simple, but as you continue to play, you'll find yourself developing more complex strategies and before you know it, you'll be hooked. 

If you like board games, then this is the game for you."
16068,Brilliant!
16069,Timeless perfection
16070,Not bad
16071,My favorite game of all time. Nuff said
16072,OOOF
16073,best civ in my opinion never fails to give a good challenge
16074,I've spent too many hours playing this game and I failed my classes because of it.
16075,Just... one... more turn.
16076,"A solid Playable game Can't say the same thing for VI a game that crashes during game play and other assorted issues, buy this game solid and well designed shame they forgot to make the newer one this good."
16077,best game ever
16078,"They updated the game recently stopping PC players and Mac players playing multiplayer. Anytime my friend tries to join on his Mac he can't even join. Before that too, their horrible new launcher they brought in with Civ 6 opened multiple instances of it and totally tanked your performance with background programs. I had to revert the game launcher to a legacy one to stop the garbage tier idiocy of the devs of this game. This game is a complete joke now and not worth the space it takes up on Steam. If you want to play anything apart from single player avoid this game for your own sanity."
16079,Hours of fun. It's everything you want from a strategy game. I would recommend buying all expansions.
16080,endless amounts of fun for years to come
16081,Great game. Could spend forever on it (if only I had the time). Great replay value. In my opinion the best Civilization game (I have played 3 others).
16082,Old school game--- No blood and guts so common with other games.... Started with Civ 2 now on Civ 5.  Tried 6 but didn't like it!
16083,Fantastic time-sucker. Great for mindlessly relaxing while conquering the world.
16084,"peak videogame, fuck you england"
16085,"One of the best Steam games of all times. If you don't own it, you're missing out."
16086,great
16087,Even though this game is about 10 years old now it has aged very well and the gameplay is still top notch.
16088,:)
16089,Fantastic buy. One of the best Strategy game series out.
16090,A more classic feel to Civ whereas Civ VI feels like a different game. Still holds up and mods are underrated. Wait for a deal under 10$ for the entire collection and enjoy.
16091,I played this for 14 hours straight without realizing it. Great game. Better than Civ 6 from what I've heard.
16092,"Amazing title. I play it for long hours and don't even notice.

Love this game. Very entertaining and the possibilities it offers are vast."
16093,I don't enjoy this game. I won't even pretend to enjoy this game. It was a waste of money. I regret it.
16094,it is fun but incredibly fucking long
16095,I enjoy that the game is able to be played casually. You dont have to sit and pay 100% attention to the game until the end of your campaign. That and I just like the whole taking over the world thing :)
16096,"very good very funee

16125,VERY ADDICTING
16126,good
16127,Awesome turn based game. Even better than the new Civ 6. It just never gets old.
16128,good
16129,just one more turn/era/game/mod is too addictive
16130,Very good
16131,One of the best strategy games I've played
16132,"Its a great game for those who love History and want to try and recreate the situations we all study about, with mods you can tweak the game so that the middle ages never end, plagues ravage over populated areas and historical factions can be added, I have been playing as the Roman Empire for years and have managed to keep a continual game going for years, creating new maps for the Empires change in size and enemies on thier border. has kept me entertained for thousands of hours."
16133,Washington every time or you're ISIS
16134,good fun

16139,Always a joy to play this game ..
16140,greatest game ever
16141,Gameplay is fun but sometimes I get paired up with some Jewish players and they can really ruin the game with their min maxing sometimes. 9.6/10
16142,"This game is an obsession, all variants of it have been. If you want to say ""just one more turn"" until the sun comes up, then this is the game for you to throw your life away on. 10/10 would lose my family to this game again."
16143,"Odds are you know this game, so I just wanna agree that it's pretty good"
16144,"Fun game to play by yourself or with friends. Haven't played any of the other Civ games other than VI, so I can't give any input on how they all compare. Really love this one though."
16145,"Great strategy game even for those, like me, who hate strategy games. You can play in chill mode or angry Ghandi mode.(You'll get that reference if you play.. or google it) Either works."
16146,"awesome fun, good for the mind"
16147,you'll forgot your time
16148,"I need to work early, but thought I'd play a few minutes before bed... 4 hours later I drag my ass to bed feeling guilty about being up so late."
16149,Still good. Like this better than VI primarily because it is low spec requirement.
16150,.
16151,Ooga booga fun game yes
16152,good very good game Uwwwuuuuwwww
16153,yes
16154,"I've been playing Civ since the very first one, which came with my multimedia kit (computers had no sound back then). Civ 5 is probably the best of the series."
16155,"I have played Civ5 on various platforms for years. Great game, the basic game is already excellent and the expansions were a nice addition of depth after the basic game had become very familiar. This is in my opinion the best game of the series so far, there's a nice level of detail without things getting overwhelming, micromanagement is kept at a good level and there are no major issues with the gameplay. The graphics is clear without being too sterile and while the soundtrack starts repeating itself in marathon sessions, it's a pretty decent soundtrack that suits Civilization."
16156,One of the best civ games much better than VI.
16157,"i just love it 
just yesterday played it 16h ... in one sitting 
just great :)"
16158,"One of the top 10 games i have ever played
"
16159,"A bit of a learning curve, but once you figure it out it becomes a lot easier. Sometimes too easy."
16160,Amazing strategy game. It's so addictive and is great for playing hours on end. I can't stress enough how fun this game is and how you can do whatever you want in it and the tactics you employ to win. Great game.
16161,"Been really enjoying it even if its a bit buggy at times! Really fun and easy to pick up!
"
16162,this game makes 8 hours go past real quick!
16163,This is Civilzation V. It does a good job at being a Civ game.
16164,"Probably the best Civ game in the series, especially with the brave new world expansion. Get it, it is entirely worth the money."
16165,Nice strategy game that you come back to again and again.

16173,"Civilization V is one of the best games ever created. I'm a firm believer in the fact that the best civ game is the one you play first. I found this pretty late in its lifespan, after all expansions were released and actually after the release of civ vi. Due to community reccomendation at the time, I ended up purchasing this version of the game instead of VI, which was a descision I did not regret whatsoever. The number of hours I have on this account is much lower than it is in reality. I played about a thousand hours of this game pirated, and another couple hundred on a different steam account. I can wholeheartedly reccomend this game to anyone interested in playing it. It often goes for around $12, which is a ridiculous price for this much game of this high quality. However, I would NOT reccomend you pay $50-60 for it. While I like it more than the sequel, looking at it objectively I think VI is just a superior game. I bought VI anthology for $50, which will probably provide a better experience for that amount of money than this game."
16174,"it sucks you in. dont play if you have an addictive personality (or do, its fun)"
16175,kool
16176,I love this game. Give me free stuff.
16177,classic. classic fun.

16184,It’s pretty good
16185,LOVE THIS GAME!  So complex with so many different outcomes.  Never fails to entertain me.  This is my go-to game when I don't know what to play
16186,"best civ game.  I've played all of them.  civ 6 sucks, stick to V,  get the mods and you can make it like a new game."
16187,best civ
16188,A CIV classic. One of the best games out there. Make sure to get the Brave New World expansion.
16189,2
16190,"Better than Civ 6. It adds lots of unneeded things like districts and used up workers. This game lets you build as many wonders as you want in one city, lets you use workers as much as you'd like without the worker disappearing (I mean... Barbarians. But cmon)
Get this. Not Civ6."
16191,Great game that i have spent countless hours on. if you like strategy games with more of a turn based twist this is for you.
16192,It has taken many many hours of my life. I could have been a doctor. I have no regrets.
16193,"2k Games deserve to be put in the stocks and flogged or stoned until death. Bought my civ 6 key and still havent recieved 6 days later really nigga i could have done 2 hours of bulbing and cleansing in this time and would still have time spare to fuck my shithole before this fucking key comes through. If i find out who is responisble i will key their car irl and force them to play through civ 6 with their prolapsed anus with my tounge firmly inside see how funny they find it then.

16204,Civilization V is a wonderful turn-based strategy game. I recommend this game to anyone who loves strategy games.
16205,Great game
16206,10/10
16207,It's like 4 but 5
16208,It's like civ 6 but it's better
16209,Why play Civ VI when you can play Civ V?
16210,Best strategy game of all time. I like this version over Civ 6
16211,"As much as I suck at this game, I still keep trying..."
16212,Best pass time out there
16213,One of the best
16214,good role play enjoy the gaming
16215,game so fun i poopooed
16216,"a great game i would recommend downloading some mods after first 1 or 2 games to stop it from getting stale
"
16217,very gud
16218,"Game is so addicting, you get sucked in so easily."
16219,good game
16220,its good but not the best
16221,it gud
16222,Whenever I open this game it suddenly becomes 1:00am
16223,fun
16224,Better than CIV 6!
16225,i just love civ
16226,It's good and I like playing as Shaka Zulu and destroying England
16227,"fun, engaging, risk with more focus on well, creating a civilization."
16228,Not too bad
16229,amazingggg
16230,"its a really good game, High Defiinition but complicated"
16231,It's ok i guess
16232,yes
16233,"You know what I love? Rome
You know what I also love? Well made roads
You can see where this is going"
16234,"too many premature glitches kill this game
"
16235,"I can spend months without playing this, go back to it, and do a 10 hour spree no problem."
16236,"I played for almost 10 years.
Sorry for late comments. You know."
16237,700+hours and i only have 20 achievements
16238,it's just fun and good--i reccomend playing in bed at night with your friend or partner!
16239,"it ok but take long
"
16240,its kinda ight
16241,"In my very biased opinion, Civ V is the best Civ. All the DLC is very fun and the only thing it doesn't have compared to 6 is that you can play Australia in 6. Still, its the best one. 

aside from that, Civ V is amazing, you can play all day and night long without getting bored, i would frequently stay up all night playing. It has the fabled ""one more turn"" effect and thats whats so good about it. 

When you accept the fact that you need it, wait for a sale. You can get the whole lot for super cheap so it makes it even more worth it."
16242,:)
16243,I have over 2000 hours in this game. A game that's 10 years and It is far superior to any other civ. Instead of just making it better they made Civ 6 which is garbage compared to this version. If Faraxis decides to make a superior game they will simple update the game engine keep the art style and mechanics and simple add quality of life improvements.
16244,Still the best Civ game.
16245,yes
16246,"REALLY AWESOME GAME :)
"
16247,just one more turn
16248,it good
16249,Played it for a few hours.  Seems okay.
16250,excellent time waster
16251,GGWP
16252,fun
16253,"good stuff, bruh."
16254,based game
16255,"For a game that was released so long ago, this is one of the most unstable games you can ever own on a Mac. I don't know how many times I have to reinstall once a week."
16256,"This is a classic turn based strategy that has gained a huge fan base through the years. I like it as it offers several types of victory which and some diplomatic options that can change the course of a game at any point. It is a lot of fun, graphics are a bit cartooney, but really pleasant to look at, I recommend to all those who want to enjoy their time while playing."
16257,it was good
16258,good game
16259,Great strategy game.
16260,100%
16261,Best game you can buy !!
16262,"I have been playing Civilization since it came out oh so long ago. Great big floppy disks and little tiny graphics. After I started having strokes my beautiful wife had me play it to jump start my brain again. I have always looked forward to the next version Civilization, Civ II, Civ III, Civ IV, and Civilization V. Sadly Civ VI was not at all what I expected. You see each version was more advanced than the last, better story, better interaction, and better graphics. Civilization V is still far better the VI. This is an outstanding game and I hope VII is far better that VI."
16263,hours upon hours of content and fun
16264,It's addictive.
16265,"The only way to cut ancient Rome in half is
A pair of Caesars
otherwise a relaxing strategy game and fun to play offline and online."
16266,"I've been gaming since the Commodore64.  Millenials: Google it.  If you play games solo or offline like I do, buy this one.  You wont regret it.  My current rig (2.8 quad core, 4mb ram, 1gb on gpu) is showing its age when compared to the requirements of newer games these days, but this game still plays fine on it.  So here are my opinions, if anybody cares:

The tech tree is a little wonky in the newer ages IMO but its still fun.  IMO, everything except warfare and espionage (Civ4 was better in those departments) has been improved over the earlier iterations of this game.  In this game, you cant tactically bomb enemy resources prior to invasion anymore, and the ""armored"" units are curiously not stronger than ordinary ""infantry"".  Also, the ""stack"" of military units from Civ4 is gone (sadly for me - I liked the stack).  Only one unit allowed per square.  Unfortunately in this game, combat is simplified and severely over-weighted to how far ahead your civ is in the tech race.  Thats ok I guess, but it unfortunately reduces playability IMO because every game and every civ basically must progress with a heavy emphasis on tech superiority if they are to survive.  Because as soon as your neighbors think they can beat you up...  even if you are on great terms with them...  you will get beat up if you fall behind in the tech race.  There is no USA-Canada relations in this game.  But overall, its a hoot to play... just... one... more... turn..."
16267,Brazil is a traitor no matter what
16268,"Great game
"
16269,"Somewhat buggy, but still a diverting game if you're not wanting to be too intense"
16270,"gud game, wud recomend"
16271,"Got this game so I could play a game with my friends over crossplay, turns out Aspyr opted to ""give consumers the best gameplay experience possible"" and in doing so disabled crossplay so there's $50 down the drain for a game that is fucking boring to play by myself.  HEY ASSPYR MAYBE PUT ""CROSSPLAY DISABLED"" IN YOUR DESCRIPTION AND GIMME MY $50 BACK YOU WALLET SUCKING LEECHES"
16272,"Probably one of the best Civ Games to date, comparable to its little brother Civ 4 BTS, this game has more balanced mechanics, better graphics then Civ 6, and a robust mechanics system for policies, religion, etc. keep in mind if is easy to exploit the AI's if you know how, but there are ways to work around that."
16273,much more user friendly in comparison to civ3
16274,"I like that it can be played with friends, or by oneself. It is a game that involves strategy and can be played a myriad of times with lots of variation."
16275,"Civ 5 is an amazing game, the games arent overly long like they are in 6 but they are still long enough to play and have a good sitting. You feel the rise of your empire and feel a certain pride in what you have made your empire is the strongest or may have developed the most culture or science."
16276,poland
16277,It's good. Play it.
16278,YEA BOI
16279,"I've always loved playing Civ, although Civ's III will always have a special place in my heart"
16280,Horrible game doesnt work constant crashes and then when it does the screen starts to have lines everywhere also doesnt work on a ultra wide screen 2560*1080 monitor fail computer game
16281,nery addictive
16282,10/10 would buy my way to world leader again
16283,10/10
16284,"Without a doubt the best strategy series of all time, and possibly the best in the series.  Only one that could compete would be civ 4 or alpha centauri if you consideri it."
16285,My all time favorite game and the first Civ game I ever played. I didn’t know what I was missing. CIV VI is also amazing but this version with all the available mods is just fantastic. Endless replay ability!
16286,fun
16287,"Ugh Civilization .... its such a love hate relationship bordering on stockholmes
I give this civ a (7/10)  the highest rated main ""Civilization"" game i've played. 
Its a good 4x game if you just turn off your common sense and brainpower
 and let the game tell you how things work. If you try to do things that made 
civilizations succeed in real life you will utterly fail.

Pros :
-Leaders feel unique and impactful
-many different paths to victory and all are reasonably obtainable
-decent trade options
-Warfare seems fine outside the occassional regenerating supercity that cant be damaged (AI opponents only)

Cons :
-Everyting that helps a civilization thrive in real life is a dumpster-fire of failure here: feed your people .... useless, build infrastructure .... useless and potentially bankrupting, settle near water Lower that civ score baby !! build a road to a city state ? doesn't increase trade ..... and costs a ton of upkeep.
-everything that doesn't really help a real civilization survive is amazing : Religion is the ultra resource, like seriously just build religion and it'll feed your people, make units for you and science harder ... its like investing in each of those other things individually with all your effort except you get them all for no efffort planning or strategy, settle in the middle of the desert and make temples ? no problem my guy you get a higher civ score than the guy on the Mediterranean Sea exploring the world and feeding his people.
-The AI is legitimate cheating gutter trash, nothing they do makes any sense and all difficulty involved in defeating them is artificial difficulty. the AI doesn't optimize better ... it doesn't make better decisions, It doesn't play to that CIV's strengths or avoid its weaknesses, they just start the AI with a bigger beat stick at the start of the game.

Never EVER play the game as Nebuchadnezzar and rush the great library you filthy degenerate.
Never EVER play as Boddicca and rush the Stonehenge you filthy degenerate.
Ghandi still has AI bug where his negative aggression makes him over 9000 aggressive he will nuke you into oblivion if you let him.

There are ultimately better 4x titles out there like Endless legend, Solaris, Galactic Civilizations 2(please not 3), etc. but its a solid addition to the genre, just tilting at times."
16288,i hate it
16289,Civ V is much better than Civ VI. Dont get the expansions as they add very little fun to the game.
16290,Good RTS game that is easy to get into for people who are new to the genre.
16291,Solid addictive gameplay. Still holds up many years later.
16292,This is an awesome strategy game. Guaranteed many hours of fun
16293,Straight up my favourite game of all time
16294,A fun game with a wide variety of strategies and play styles. Learn a little about history and conquer the globe in your own way!
16295,very great to play with friends
16296,epic
16297,Wonderful
16298,"I've played the game for a while on my shitty laptop, but still had a great time! I couldn't play at the highest specs, but that didn't change the game-play at all. The mechanics beyond the base level were pretty hard to figure out (first time playing a Civ game), but I got them in time. While I never played much with friends, I can say that the AI were fun (and sometimes frustrating) opponents. Enjoy sinking a bunch of time into this one."
16299,I can play this game for hours.
16300,"underrated , like the historical content to, all in all heart warming"
16301,This game shaped my love for history.
16302,pretty boring
16303,it's civ
16304,fun
16305,it's a good game
16306,it is a good war game
16307,Fun and addicting
16308,The best CIV and good for your Pepega Laptop
16309,"A very good game, better than 6 in my opinion"
16310,I would recommend this game.
16311,Better than the 4 before.
16312,fun and ghandi nukes people :)
16313,"very fun! every game is different which makes it never get old. have about 2,000 hours of this game, highly recommend especially if your into this type of stuff!"
16314,uh oh stinky ottomans
16315,Very entertaining game
16316,Still playing in 2020. This game has aged very well.
16317,Got nuked by Gandhi
16318,"Civ 5 has been the best strategy game I have ever played. With all the DLC greatly benefited to my experience. Whether it's Diplomacy, Scientific, Domination, or Culture. Each route makes each Civ a wonder to play."
16319,It doesn't adjust to resolutions above 1080 p. but I like it
16320,It's Sid Meier's Civilization... I mean c'mon.
16321,s
16322,Better than Civ 6. Buy the DLC
16323,"good way to waste time, must have dlc to enjoy tho"
16324,"A classic addition to the Civ series, with some nice added features from previous version."
16325,its civ 5 do need to say anymore 10/10 love wasting 6 hours of my days in 10 minutes
16326,goof
16327,Still enjoy more than Civ VI
16328,i liek dis game it hav nukkes hehe
16329,Very cool game
16330,Yes
16331,One of my all time favorites.
16332,I would recommend this game with all of its DLC'
16333,"Fun, engaging, strategic, in depth but not over complex
"
16334,Still havent bothered with civ 6. How can the game be better than this? lol.
16335,"I liked how you really felt more powerful as time went on, as if you were a real empire.
"
16336,its alright i guess
16337,"Instant Classic and an excellent edition to an already excellent series.  Honestly you only need one Civ (or 4X game) in general to fill its niche but this is an excellent one to start with if the latest of the line is too expensive at the time.  Be prepared to sink entirely too much time into any one game (no really, take measures because you will lose track of time as you build your empire and manage all the units to support it.)"
16338,very cool!
16339,Been a while since I played this game.  I've loved Civilization since its Start.
16340,gid
16341,Love taking over the world again and again.
16342,Nice
16343,Good
16344,DLC's are over priced.
16345,better than civ 6
16346,I laughed. I cried. I forgot to go to bed.
16347,"Endless replay value. Still going strong on the old laptop, literally my go to guilty pleasure game to play on a lazy afternoon or rained in/snowy weekend!"
16348,"I love playing Civ V just to waste time. I've played it so for so long now that I can play it without even thinking about it. I'm not an expert player, I just like wasting time with it."
16349,Honestly this game is my equivalent to crack cocaine. Do not buy it if you are trying to be a functional human being.
16350,"Endless amount of fun. 
Looking forward to another 1000 hours and then more........."
16351,funny barbarian go brrrr
16352,"good
"
16353,Helps you ;earn about history in a fun way.
16354,much better
16355,dis gaem gud
16356,"Its a fun way to pass the time, especially if you have time to burn"
16357,Send help.
16358,BEAUTIFUL SMOOTH AWESOME.
16359,It is the only game I play to be honest. Great interface.  The only thing I don't like is it's a bit slow processing turns even on a newer 2019 machine with good specs.
16360,Its a great game in the series. They screwed up civ 6 but civ 5 is AMAZING. Enjoy it.
16361,ye
16362,best game ever
16363,"A very nice tabletop strategy game, which combines city building, empire building and conquest neatly in a simplified way - making this a joy to play and relax."
16364,Civ 2 was the best but Civ 5 tends to rule them all.
16365,It's alright.
16366,WOULD YOU BE INTERESTED IN A TRADE AGREEMENT WITH ENGLAND?
16367,"[b]I would just like to preface, I am only recommending this game if you buy the 2 main expansions for this game! [/b]

I was very disappointed when I picked up the base game, it felt like a skeleton of a game in comparison to Civ IV and lacked depth. The removal of random events makes it feel flat in comparison and does not really encourage full map exploration like the previous instalment; it was fun to explore the map and be rewarded with a new technology or an additional unit. I will also admit I am biased and do miss hearing Leonard Nimoy's voice reading out the technologies - which you can no longer trade.

I do enjoy the fact they have kept in the scenarios and created many more; I do think they are a good way to take a break from building your empire and focus on a specific task, testing your skills in a different setting. The improvement on the tiles from squares to hex based is greatly appreciated, it makes unit movement much less clunky and opens up more options when in a military engagement. 
The remove of unit stacking is a shame, I feel it does dampen combat slightly as everything is so spread out but actually being able to see how many units the enemy has does out-weight this. Also the less weight on the unique abilities of units means combat feels less smarter, brute force just feels like the default rather than a carefully planned out army to counter the forces of your enemies - I will readily admit strategy games are not my forte, but it personally removes my sense of accomplishment at overcoming and a greater enemy force with wisely chosen units.

Even when you have both of the main expansions, the espionage feels less impactful than the previous game. Being able to actively sabotage the other city with poisoning the water or bombing buildings and stealing technology, amongst other things, compared to a more lackluster system in this version. The addition of city states is a fantastic idea and I believe it greatly enhanced the diplomacy strategy, I even feel it is a viable strategy in Civ 5, though not having a numerical breakdown on the effect of actions on diplomatic relations does make it a little harder to calculate how much things will change.

The change in how city borders expand during growth has change drastically from the previous game; in Civ IV the border expanded in a set amount around the whole of the city, whilst in Civ V it expands by a single tile - though you can either select the next tile you want to expand into or purchase extra tiles if there is a resource you want. It adds a different take on city expansion and makes it a little more strategic. Though the size of the city borders is much smaller than Civ IV, so it can be both good and bad depending on where you settled - it makes it easier to miss the later resources, unless you have good trade agreements. 

Overall, it is another solid 4X strategy game and whilst I do enjoy it, am personally not as gripped by it like I was by Civ IV. I would happily recommend if you are new to the Civilisation series or have friends you can play with, though I do feel you need all the 2 main expansions to get the most out of it and that could be cost prohibitive for a good game."
16368,excellent strategy and building game!
16369,its a great game i can spent all day playing it and doing different things all the time so many ways too play this game
16370,Fun times :')
16371,"Civ V is one of those games with enough replayability; to always have you coming back for years. I have been a fan of the series since I first played Civ 3. Its also a lot of fun with friends, the only issue being there are no longer NPC's sending you trade offers. In singleplayer you'll have an entirely different experience as the NPC's love to ask for donations, trades, peace, war, and the other options. 

Whether you intend to play online or offline, I recommend this game."
16372,"Horrible Game development, great concept, gameplay, etc. The developers just have no idea what they're doing, and refuse to make any improvements, and only continue to make things worse, and more glitchy and buggy with each update. Don't recommend buying at this point because they will most likely never fix all the glaring bugs and other issues the game has."
16373,"Don't buy 6 buy this one. Don't cheap out and buy the base game either, GOTY or bust"
16374,a game  you can always reinstall and play again and again and again...
16375,the game is a great game i ave had the Civ games for years now and when im board of new games it always calls me back to it one game you can enjoy for years to come and will always challenge you i do like the domination line
16376,why can't I play infection>?
16377,The best Civilization game. After I bought civ 6 I found myself immedietly coming back to this masterpiece
16378,"Good game overall.Came from Civ 5,miss stacked units."
16379,"Iv'e played for 278 hours....so yeah its a pretty good game
"
16380,Better the CIV VI.
16381,It's a fun game that you can have fun against Ai's or have fun with your friends. (PS The Ai Cheats).
16382,Solid civilization program. Requires planning and skills to balance growth with achievements. Easy to follow development steps in gaining power and knowledge in developing your empire. Bright and clean graphics.
16383,Addictive with or without friends..
16384,hexagons
16385,"Game so good, makes you wanna slap yo mama"
16386,never gets old
16387,"If you haven't played a CIV game, it might seem hard to get into, but trust me, once you do, it's fun. Don't be afraid to look for custom content either, this game has lots of fun in store if you look in the right places."
16388,Best Civ game. They are all great but this one smacks absolute ass.
16389,"one click madness,say goodbye to the ones you love"
16390,fuck gangis khan
16391,its aight
16392,its great just play it lol
16393,Good
16394,Glitchy af but amazing
16395,addicting. buy the dlc's. korea enough said.
16396,Never ending fun
16397,Love it!  So much better than IV
16398,Civilization is one of my favorite games!
16399,"Easily the best Civ to date, great soundtrack to immerse yourself in the world.
Though the graphics have ages since its inception and release, the game holds well compared to the over complicated Civ 6. The modding community has added extra content to the base game which increases replayability, what a nice thing. Although i have almost 500 hours of game play, i could count another 300 hours extra before i got it on steam. I Always come back to this game because it still has a lot to offer."
16400,It's super addicting which sucks but it is really cool and awesome.
16401,"intro music made me cry 10/10
"
16402,"The best way to lose a day while saying ""one more turn"""
16403,fun. I play about 20 games in a row every like 2 years and enjoy it. So I would say a long term investment and an old classic.
16404,SWEEET
16405,Do you like taking over the world? In this game you can do that. Everyone jokes about Ghandi being a real jerk but I'm here to tell you the real truth.  Alexander. Greece. This guy is the truest form of evil in this game. he starts out being like oh hey wanna come over and play CoD and drink some mountain dew? then he just !%$'s you mercilessly for like 2000 years with his tricky nonsense and then he somehow gets all the city states to gang up on you and you just die in congress. Man this game is great. Would Recommend. 16/10
16406,fair gameplay
16407,Turn based Country RPG. I've always loved games like this. You can play them solo or team up with others in online battles. one of my fav games.
16408,doesnt work wouldnt reccomentd
16409,This game is ok. I havent played much so I am not sure. Just one more turn.
16410,"Sets the bar high for other Strategy Games, best Civ ever made."
16411,"currently playing the multiplayer with a few friends and we are having a blast.  Matches last around 20 hours over a few sessions.  It has been the distraction that was needed in the COVID world that we live in now.  With so much choice in this game, it is an absolute thrillride to play, which is something I never thought I would say about a 4x title"
16412,I like stratagy and puzzle type games.  The longer it take the better.  So...this fits perfectly
16413,Great strategy game (I have played all the way from Civ 1). I love the turn based model and the complexities the game shows. I would even call it educational (understanding the importance of technology advance and the particulars of political and cultural choices).
16414,Haha nuke go brrrrr
16415,"you can play this game. sometimes you win, but usually you lose. often it is time consuming. i like to play this game but also i feel guilty because i spend so much time to play this game. there have many options! yay"
16416,"This game is fantastic, simply one of the best version
i can play for hours  andhours with this game."
16417,"I like killing, and plundering other civilizations. I love gold too! Other people's gold especially!"
16418,Sigh.  I keep coming back.  Through multiple other games I come back.  The mods are just too good and the microtransactions and gameplay issues in other 4k games make me come back to Civ 5.  So many hours.  So many turns...
16419,Very Nice
16420,"Civ V is definitely my favorite Civ so far. I've played Civ IV and it felt a bit too chaotic and old school; I've tried Civ VI and it feels a bit too complicated and not with the graphical upgrade I had in mind (that said, both are no doubt very good games). Civ V has just the right balance of a good gameplay and nice graphics.

If you're someone new to the franchise, just buy Civ VI and don't worry about the hate it sometimes gets from hardcore fans--it's very much a great game. If, on the other hand, you're more of the experimental or even retro-like gamer, play this. It was definitely a turning point for the franchise, 4X and turn-based strategy games. The hex grid, more complex combat, HD graphics--stuff we all take for granted in many strategy games today, all started here in 2010."
16421,This game is amazing and fun with friends. You need to be a die hard when it comes to video games if you want to play it though. Matches can take a very long time and some people do not like that. The game makes you think in ways you never thought possible and every lose just teaches how to play the next game. No round will ever be the same.
16422,"At this point, you can find someone to better explain this. You either know its for you, or its not for you. Amazing game."
16423,"good, better than 6"
16424,fun
16425,"Great game, haven't locked to many hours in but definitely one of the best turn based strategy games out there"
16426,pretty decent
16427,A great old game
16428,"One of the most balanced turn based strategy games I have played, playing with friends or family is fun!"
16429,"Have been playing Civiliztion 5 for ages now. Just noticed that I haven't written a review yet. Who knows, maybe it's gonna help someone realize that they should start the Civ series from this one and not the latest piece of dung. Otherwise they might dismiss the entire series because of a bad apple.
I usually play with the Vox Populi mod pack, which I recommend to everyone. Note that it makes the game significantly harder.

Civ 5 is the last true Civ game. It's advanced enough and it ages well, since the graphics are not that important in a game like this. The AI is decently smart, and it's very well balanced.
I played the Civ 6 and have mostly poor impressions on it. If you want the most recent and most advanced Civ experience, I'd rather recommend you to play the Civ 5 with all the DLC and the Vox Populi (also known as the Communitas Patch). It's leages above the civ 6 and even contains features absent there.

When they make the Civ 7 game I hope they learn from Civ 5 success."

16431,Good
16432,"Have you played Civilizations, ever? This is very much the same.

If you haven't played Civilizations, check out a Youtube video and get to know what the deal is."
16433,meh
16434,Best turn based strategy game ever made. It's too bad about Civ VI though....
16435,Its good
16436,i love this game! I can play for hours
16437,probably the best civ game
16438,"Had a lot of fun playing this game, lots of fun and intresting ways to play, however be prepared to sink a lot of time into this game."
16439,Honestly one of the greatest games of all time
16440,"One of the greatest strategy games ever made, if not the greatest. I cannot really describe how good it is in words. My only real complaint is that the game is nowhere near as good as other strategy without the DLC.

If you have all the DLC, DOWNLOAD THE VOX POPULI MOD. It actually makes the game one of the greatest games ever made.

If you like strategy games, buy the game and all the DLC. 

If you even enjoy video games even the smallest bit, buy the game, this is an experience you cannot miss out on."
16441,Great game
16442,"I have 697 hours in this game. Take my advise, buy this game if you like grand strategy, or other Civ games. My personal favorite of the Civilization games, especially with both major DLC's (Gods & Kings and Brave New World). If you don't know which DLC to buy if you only want one, get Brave New World. BNW adds in depth trading with makes it so much easier to manage your economy, as well as a few really interesting nations (also the opening cut scene is the best). Every world can be adjusted statistically before even starting the game, for example if you'd like to start with an abundance of resources, there is an option for that. There's no set amount of nations or world size, those are also customizable. I definitely suggest getting this game."
16443,Great version of Civ possibly the best yet
16444,"Highly addictive game, decent strategy level & quite enjoyable on many playthroughs"
16445,"Best Civ a must buy
"
16446,"Extremely addictive, I stayed up until around 2am twice in a row because I just couldn't stop playing it"
16447,"It's great, but I always tend to start a new game after I'm close to the end. It's more fun in the beginning of the game."
16448,Way better than the sixth! I'm already at 700 hours of gameplay and still ain't tired of playing it! :D I will always recommend it to all of my friends
16449,This game is on fire!!! im thank i was introduced to this
16450,Good game for relaxing as you slowly build your empire and forget what time it is.
16451,"No, I can't do another turn, I need sleep. NOOOOOOOOOOOO!!!"
16452,fun
16453,a
16454,"In 2020 this is an older game, but still a great one. The only real negative is the still high prices of the DLC. I own it all but it cost quite a lot."
16455,"Easily the most played game in my library, and for good reason."
16456,"Civ v is the absolute bee's knees when it comes to 4X games.  I was sucked into it by watching the Yogscast and can I just say I never expected to enjoy singleplayer so much.  In order to really enjoy it you have to own all the DLC and using the NOQuitters mod is also a really good idea as it helps fix balance issues.

It's a singleplayer game that really makes you wonder where the time went and even to this day I have only played as a handful of Civs so it near-infinite replayability.  If I didn't have to eat and shit then I would play this games for 12 hrs at a time in singleplayer.  Small note though, the AI is terrible sometimes and you need to play on harder difficulties in order to not steamroll them.

Multiplayer is where the game shines.  Playing with your friends is absolutely amazing especially as the private chat allows you to wheel-and-deal behind people's backs and make allies and then swiftly betray them.  You can really piss people off and the social element of the game is great.
HOWEVER.  Multiplayer is so shite.  It's so poorly implemented and works so badly.  The larger the maps and the more players you have, the worse it is.  At some points you may even knock your friend out of the game just so it runs better.  There are some tips and tricks that you have to learn in order to make multiplayer ""work"" (spam esc por example) and it is a pain in the arse.  However when you do sit down and manage to play hours of the game with your buddies, then you'll realise that it was all kind of worth it.

AND THEN YOUR BUDDY WILL SHIT ON YOU WITH HIS 20 SHIPS OF THE LINE AND RUIN THE ENTIRE GAME BECAUSE YOU SETTLED ON THE COAST WHEN ENGLAND WAS IN THE GAME AND YOU ABSOLUTELY DESERVED IT YOU PIECE OF DUTCH SHIT.

Gud Gam :)"
16457,GANDHI
16458,Fun strategy game. Just be prepared for long games
16459,It's alright
16460,"Nice expansive games, hours worth of playing time."
16461,"If you had to choose a 'Desert Island Game', you would be hard pressed to find one better than this. Endlessly replayable, and just as addictive after 100 hours as it was when you first played it. Simply marvellous. 
Some games make you want to play 'one more turn', this game demands that you play one more game, thus wasting another 12 hours of your life."
16462,hot mods and even hotter nukes
16463,Çöp Meier's Civilization 5
16464,Every Civ5 game plays different and offers new challenges.  The game stay fresh and never boring.  This one is a classic!
16465,"I honestly don't understand how this game is so positively received, and I was fooled by the amazing reception. Pretty much no part of the game is properly explained. The game is devoid of any helpful tutorial, and the system to control your civilization is so counterintuitive that it makes zero sense. The game is also incredibly unrealistic and the consequences of your choices don't really make much sense. The pacing throughout time periods is also too fast, and you can't truly experience each age in depth. It honestly plays like a really bad middle school computer project."
16466,Awesome game. Less stuff to do and sometimes simpler than in Civ 6 but it makes the game smoother and faster which can be good if you like to focus more on politics and developing ideas instead of city building/management in civ 6
16467,great game
16468,"Holy poop this is pretty good
"
16469,"Ok, Civ is amazing.  End of review."
16470,Great strategy game and being turn based allows me to take breaks without losing progress or being overrun.
16471,good
16472,Great game!
16473,This game has been crashing for many years on multiple consoles and even on an I9 2080 pc. Wasted hours.
16474,It's like crack
16475,Noice
16476,"very fun resource management game

16482,awesome
16483,really fun when high
16484,its so fun you can have fun all day and play all day while having fun and playing the game because its fun
16485,I still prefer Civ5 to Civ6.
16486,yes
16487,Not enough cowbell
16488,"Honestly the best 4X strategy game of its time, Civ 5 stands as a shining example of how good the civilization series can be at its peak, with its two major flaws being multiplayer combat as well as netcode in general"
16489,it is amazing even ten years later why get civ 6 when it is NZ$100 and this and all its dlcs on sale are NZ$70
16490,"I was hesitant at first, but this is an incredible improvement over all the previous games.  No more unit stacks of doom, game balances against aggressive expansion better, unnecessary units gone forever... there's just so many improvements, it's hard to list them all.  Try the demo if you aren't sure, but for me, this is heads and shoulders above Civ IV."
16491,The best ever... Max cortisol...   Protean...
16492,Civilization serisi benim için her zaman sevdiğim bir seri olmuştur. Civ2'den beri severiz :)
16493,THE BEST GAME
16494,Can just get lost into it.
16495,yes
16496,is pretty good
16497,"Great game, has better leaders on it than Civilization VI does, i nuked every country while playing as mahatma gandhi
10/10 i recommend it."
16498,"fun game, especially if you just want to chill while you're taking over an empire. the gameplay is smooth and the graphics are good just chill out and build a civilization from nothing."
16499,"Amazing game. On the surface it seems simple and looks like you just fight to win, upon playing a while and researching, this game is much deeper than that. Give it time to reach it's full potential and you won't be disappointed."
16500,"boardgame style, but infinitely more complex and variable as the computer is doing all the hard work of running the game"
16501,lit
16502,"Played one game where a friend of mine was France. He kept getting invaded, each time losing only one city to the AI. The whole game then revolved around constant campaigns of reclaiming the lost city of Orleans. Each time the city was recaptured and regained, it was renamed. The first time 'New Orleans', the second time, 'Newer Orleans', and so forth. France will forever remember the storied past of '[u]Newest Orleans[/u]'; the strongest and most enduring city in the world. 'Til all are one."
16503,"Still one of the best strategy games out there, it is turn based and takes ages to play, but when you have the time for it, it sure is enjoyable. Not that well optimized and a bit out, but sure give it a try if CIV 6 is too expensive for you!"
16504,"Good Game
"
16505,Enjoy the game
16506,it game gud
16507,I could spend hours playing this game.
16508,Iti s a cool game to kill some time. It can be very enjoyable
16509,Great Game.
16510,good
16511,"Nice simulations with differing levels of complexity.  Helpful in that there are various levels of guidance provided so it provides a lot of guidance early on, but you can reduce it once you grow familiar with the game.  Nice to play with friends remotely."
16512,Great game to play with friends wish it had mod support for multiplayer tho
16513,I've invested 3450 hours into this game. I think that's probably all I need to say.
16514,"its ok, i guess"
16515,Barbarians have been spotted near one of your cities.
16516,First Civilization game with Hex tiles. Huge improvement over prior games.
16517,Very in depth simulation. Lots or strategy and varying way to win. Can have just as much fun online as playing against the computer.
16518,Good
16519,"Fifth civ best civ, buy with BNW and G&K for best experience."
16520,"Do you suffer from depression? are you stuck inside due to the corona virus? Play a Civ game and you might be finished with the game by the time the pandemic is over!

16521,Very good strategic games.
16522,Noiceee
16523,A large time sink that I'd personally play a million times over Civ6 and CivBeyondEarth.
16524,I personally enjoy this one more than VI atm. I would definitely recommend this game! ^^
16525,"Granted I have all the DLC's but this game is really great. Civ 6 isn't bad, I just think this game with all the DLC is better."
16526,Utterly addictive.
16527,Good gam
16528,"Very good Strategy yet confusing if you just jump right in, make sure you read up to correctly upgrade."
16529,"It's alright, I guess."
16530,u git to clap hoes
16531,Love it!
16532,Fantastic game. I still play it over Civ 6. Five stars.
16533,good.
16534,"Good game, fun to play sometimes"
16535,I've spent almost 4 months of a 9-5 job playing this game. It is one of the best strategy games ever IF you have the DLC. Buy it on sale with all the DLC for under the cost of a new game and enjoy losing all of your free time for the foreseeable future.
16536,I've bought many new games during quarantine and ignored them for this game i've owned for five years. It's an amazing game. It's too bad the DLC are so expensive because it's pretty hard to go back to playing without them. But the game fucking slaps if you have all of them. Get it on sale when they are all together and then never play anything else.
16537,this game has taken over my life
16538,Get a culture victory as the Huns in multiplayer to REALLY put hair on your eyeballs
16539,It's  a good strategy game
16540,sick game with friends you will get addicted to it and play for atleast 30 years before noticing that the AI Will RAPE YOU IN THIS GAME AND YOU HAD ZERO CHANCE FROM THE START OF BUYING IT.
16541,Great game!
16542,Excellent
16543,bvvvvvvvv
16544,good
16545,"Little to no micromanagement compared to previous Civ Games. Good graphics with great gameplay. Still better than Civ VI.

My only complaint is of ""just one more turn"" syndrome. This is a productivity and sleep destroyer. If you're in a university or working a full time job, I would hesitate to play this game until retirement. It will destroy your life until you remove it from all your devices. Civ 6 won't do that."
16546,Is it flawed and a little unbalanced? Yes. Do the Ancient and Medieval eras fly by too fast? Yes. Is it fun? Oh yes.
16547,Very fun. BNW is worth it
16548,"Fantastic game with the DLC, even better with the community mods. Certainly best to get it in a bundle, but it is a great game."
16549,"very fun, good time"
16550,iotehfsduh
16551,you completely get into another world in this game and you choose a leader and from there you make history this game is def worth while
16552,The game is perfect for those who love strategy and like with to play with possibilities of countless different worlds and paths civilization could've taken.
16553,good
16554,"To my shame I regularly practice ethnic cleansing on Civ V, burning cities to the ground that haven't been founded by my people - even when they have World Wonders within them. I am worse than Slobodan Milosevic. In 'real' life I read the Guardian, but I'm not sure that makes up for the war crimes I've committed."
16555,"Very customisable, a lot of fun to change parameters and run different Ai only scenarios

16557,what i like about this product
16558,jon holmes
16559,"Disabled crossplatform multiplayer since 2019. Man, I miss buying games that just did what they said they would as long as you owned them.

As of now, an unrecoverable error is continually occurring. I can't launch the game. On the same computer, with the same specs, with the same game version. What on earth."
16560,its still ok
16561,"It is fun, but beware, you will lose sense of time playing it.  One more turn turns into 3 hours later."
16562,awesome game after all these years
16563,"Its fun, but dont play with people that leave as soon as they start losing"
16564,Haven't played much but i'm enjoying it
16565,pew
16566,I LOVE BIGLY
16567,It's my go-to game. I've put over 900 hours into it. That pretty much says it all.
16568,
16569,If you like turn based strategy games Civ V is the pinnacle of that genre.
16570,"When I first started this game, it seemed like a fun past time to relieve some stress after work. After nearly 900 hours, my wife left me and I've lost my job. I saw my child for the first time since I got the game yesterday and he didn't even recognize me.
I'd highly recommend the game."
16571,"The good old CIV V, never disappoints."
16572,"Still the best civ!
"
16573,The game provides a realistic outcome of war against neighbors.
16574,"nice

One of the finest games I've played and that which will stay with me for long, even if I play once or twice a year."
16585,This is a truly brilliant game and I would 100% recommend this to anyone even thinking about playing it.
16586,An addicting and complex 4X strategy game. 8/10
16587,good

16591,A*
16592,Good game to get lost in for a few hours.
16593,"Amazing game. Been an avid Civilization player from all the way back in Civ 2. This version and Civ VI are both installed on my PC and I play them both quite a bit. Civ V and Civ VI are slightly different beasts - with Civ VI having nicer graphics but also a more intelligent AI - but it tends to get slower as you progress long into the game (even though I am running on the latest 2019 Inter i7 + Nvidia 1080Ti graphics with 32GB ram). 

For me Civ V offers the best balance between gameplay, pace of the late game and graphics."
16594,"Some lag issues, and a few disconnects, but it hasn't deterred us from playing, we love the game, thanks."
16595,Im retarded and I really like this game
16596,I'm able to walk away at anytime and not hurt the game play. Having a family to look after doesn't give me a lot of time to play a game for hours without breaks.
16597,"i made the great city of fuckhammer, and with this city i survived four nukes, an invasion that lasted 300 years and made my friend alt - f4. so yes. play this game :)"

16603,1000+ hours and still never gets old. Also thanks to the marvelous community for developing MODS that keeps this classic very much relevant and enjoyable.
16604,"Lots of fun, Civ VI is ok, but not as good as V"
16605,Yup.
16606,"Great game
"
16607,"Slight learning curve in the beginning. Suuuuper long games. Aside from that, it's aight

Downside is it's prone to crashing with no autosave."
16608,"Amazing game, I have played 376 hours of this nonsense"
16609,"A classic game and probably the best one in the series. If you've never played a Civilization game before, Civ 5 is the place to start. It's *the* turn based strategy game that will leave you saying just one more turn well into the night."
16610,Game is a great and fun thing to play w/ friends and if your bored w/ no internet. Overall poggers.
16611,sweet!

16619,cool game
16620,I purchased this game about 10 years ago. I recently started playing again and it is still just as good. It's rich from early game through mid until the end. I would highly recommend this for anyone who loves strategy.

16634,Only bad thing about this game is 12 hours goes by like nothing.
16635,"It's a great game. I used to play the Singleplayer a lot, although after a certain point it gets either boring because the AIs are too weak or boring because the AI just spams units.
I like to play it with my friends now. There are some things I don't like where the game doesn't seem to be finished (it is obviously). But if you have long days you want to spend on a nice round-based strategy game, i can recommend it!"
16636,fucking barbs
16637,"its one of the best Strategy games ever, if not the best"
16638,Even after several play throughs it's enjoyable.  I've tried Civ VI and couldn't beat it after a half dozen games at the easiest level.  I'm a casual gamer but I've been playing these sorts of games for decades.  Civ V was the peak for this franchise.
16639,It dosent get old and you can come and go as you please

16661,"   Enjoy the thrilling experience of becoming the most influential culture to win a cultural victory, only to then realize that Napoleon is beating you by a margin too great to surpass, forcing you to eradicate his culture from existence so that you may claim the lead. Then realize that eradicating another culture from existence has made you look like a war-mongering lunatic, thereby lowering your influence with the other nations, until you come to the rational, well-tempered, and completely reasonable decision to make your culture the most prominent by EXTERMINATING ALL OTHER CULTURES. Suddenly, history makes a whole lot more sense."
16662,i have been playing civ 5 for years now and its still an amazing game hours of content to create and enjoy!
16663,Plain addictive.
16664,"I have no friends anymore, because my people need me to make Babylon the greatest civilisation of the 22th century but greece is overproducing nuclear missiles to invade me and take the lands they want since year 1250."
16665,The latest and best civ. Civ 6 is a different game and not civ. so if you want the best of sid meyrs civ 5 it is
16666,"Another awesome Civ game.  More complex, new subtleties evey playthrough.  Lots of Civs, some really weak w/ crappy units but others are great and soem seem awesome.  Love the social policies.  Biggest negative is the computer is strategically dumb when attacking, does not press advantage and has bad overall ideas (get allies to join war that are not close to theater of operations, fight enemies they are not next to)."
16667,I think I am going to have to play another 350 hours to see if this game is good. lol

16669,"Download this game, you want fun, WARIO give you fun. ""Hey quite down I'm stroking my Cannoli whaaaaaaaaaaaaa"""
16670,"Best Civ game currently. If your looking for another Civ game thats a little different, check out Beyond Earth. Very decent game."
16671,Great game
16672,Sophisticated game of strategy requiring balancing of many issues but at the same time intuitive and relatively simple to play.
16673,"Just like CIV-4 - AI sucks.  Actually, there is no artificial intelligence.  The game cheats for the computer-controlled players to make the game ""somewhat interesting."" But the umpteenth time you come across a civ with NO tiles improved who is your technological superior or a civ with tech that magically improves in relation to yous - despite the fact their science output is less than half of yours - you'll regret purchasing this game."
16674,Fantastic game. I still love playing this version even with the newer game out.
16675,just one more turn
16676,"Good game but, it needs to be re-installed constantly.  WTF!?"

16682,"take this game as a way to pass time but the multiplayer community isn't so bad as well as the additional add on segments but there's not a huge demand. This is a game of real strategy when you play above level 4, since the game really cheats after level 4 difficulty in single player. how you build and deploy your units matters and this game is a true test strategy when playing against other players, while still being fair. Watch out, there are hackers who will ruin your game and your precious time."
16683,"The old Civs are... old, and Civ6 feels too much like work. Civ5 hits the sweet spot of not too complex and not too simple. It's enjoyable, it's fun, it doesn't take long to get into. Brave New World is absolutely essential to that review, though."
16684,Yes
16685,Play it
16686,yes
16687,"If you enjoy chess, role-playing games, and history then there aren't enough good things to say about this game.

16696,"Probably my fave stratigy game, i think it is very easy to get a hang of and if you want to get in to the minmax bit that is not to hard either
the game is amazing however i will say DO NOT GET IT WITCH OUT THE DLC!
the game witch no DLC is nothing compered to the DLC, its everything you exspect a CIV game to be and more, deffently the best CIV ever made
11/10 would reccomend"
16697,Just one more turn....
16698,"easy single player game for those with some time for world builders.
Takes too long for multiplayer in my opinion"
16699,it fun
16700,its good
16701,so fun - too fun. as in hours will pass - your age will increase but you will still press next turn. even as your wife and kids physically attempt to drag you from your computer you will resist and sid meier will get off to your addiction.
16702,gg
16703,"Great game, solid all around. Lots of DLC barriers though."
16704,this game is great to play with friends!
16705,is good
16706,hgfuytgf
16707,dang
16708,Its fun.
16709,"I love playing civ! Whether it's playing solo, trying out a new nation, or playing a group game against my family, it's always a good time. I could keep playing for hours!"
16710,"It's 10:00 at night. You just got back from work and you want something to do. You pull up Civ V and play till 6:00 in the morning, then you have to go to work at 7:00, great..."
16711,epic win
16712,"Pros:
-Amazing 4X game
-Lots of civilizations and units
-Lots of optimization and management
-Fun combat and other win conditions
-Just a whole lot of fun

Cons:
-No glaring flaws"
16713,Everytime my dad and I try to play he will invite me and ill join and it says version mismatch. Im on mac and hes on pc and it says cross compatible but it really isnt. Fix the game
16714,It's ok.
16715,"As far as civ games go, this one is good"
16716,fun game
16717,"Very addictive and can soak up hours to develop and win. I have VI on the xbox one and it is a bit more complicated but this is definitely a lot of fun. 

note that every time windows does an update, i have issues launching the game"
16718,fun
16719, afqfa
16720,Good Game
16721,staple in my library
16722,this game is so fun you. can wast hours playing the game it is legendairy. it is in my top 10 best game of all time.
16723,"If you like Civ type games this one isn't a bad purchase at this point if you do not have it wait for a big sale. 
Civ 5 isn't as good as say Civ4 but Civ5 has some polish and charm to it that the older version didn't have. 
I still find some game mechanics get broke or removed...my biggest knock DLC locked Civ leaders. I understand some times sure a nice expansion but I would like more choices from the start.

I reviewed this a long time ago but for what ever reason Steam doesn't show."
16724,great time killer
16725,good game
16726,great game
16727,Prefer this game over Civ VI.
16728,It's okay.
16729,"I wish I could yell you I wasn't addicted to this game, but I am."
16730,"Took a little getting used to after coming from earlier Civ games, but has really grown on me. The modding and multiplayer scenes are great. Highly recommend trying the Superpower: Clash of Civilizations total conversion."
16731,"I remember how enjoyable and playable Civ III was. Civ V is all that and more! I often recommend it to people, saying it's like Civ III, but with modern/upgraded graphics, gameplay and an advanced AI. Is it weird that I play it everyday?"
16732,It good
16733,Good
16734,Fantastic! Much better than the IV or the VI
16735,"The game is fun, especially at the beginning and the middle. But during the war it gets super tedious and time consuming just to move your units. Beware."
16736,One. More. Turn.
16737,fire till this day!!!!
16738,Incredible
16739,"Very fun, kept me coming back for years. buy dlc tho"
16740,It's Civilization. One more turn please.
16741,Very replayable.
16742,fucking god tier
16743,issa hella good game - gnome maximus
16744,Its aight
16745,WHAT U WaITING FOR
16746,"very fucking retarded that I can't play this shitty game that I over paid for on my macbook with my friends anymore becscause they decided to stop doing simple updates, they should also have a giant disclaimer for Mac users because I convinced my other friend to also buy this on the mac also, now we can't play, fucking scam"
16747,MMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAACCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCC
16748,"This game is time travel machine. You just click the ""Next Turn"" button a few times, and suddenly, the whole day has passed - you don't feel tiredness, you don't feel thirst, you don't feel hunger. It's perfect. Just give it a few turns, and then check the time."
16749,Civ III meets its match here.  This is a fighting game.  You don't spend your energies worrying about what your religion is and how much science you are generating and other incidental things like you do in Civ VI but otherwise the game play is similar - modern and smooth.  This is also faster than Civ VI with much less wait time.  This is the best of the series by a good bit.
16750,
16751,good
16752,very good game play it
16753,kills!
16754,"unbeatable the best stategey game

16755,Cool game with friends. After 80 hours i still don´t know how to play.
16756,many things mostly Steam for providing the platform
16757,"This game is gonna suck away your life, and you're going to happily let it."

16759,
16760,great
16761,"its civ, its fun, i like it"
16762,Extremely fun game
16763,"This is much better game than Civ 6
"
16764,Cool
16765,good game - build your world game
16766,"Simply, the Best CIV game ever both in past and future"
16767,ye
16768,"Wonderful game, you could get lost in it for hours, quite worth 30$ AUD especially during these times. Not much else I can say, you have to experience this for yourself. The detail put into this game is impressive and how gripping it is makes it worthwhile. If I were to be picky, I'd detest against the hexagons, but that's no issue."
16769,It is enjoyable I guess
16770,"This is the best Civ game ever made. That includes Civ 6. This game is better in almost every way then Civ 6, and the community mod makes it even better. This game with all its expansions is the pinnacle of Civilization games  up to this point, even ten years after its first release. I can't even go into enough details about why this is better then Civ 6, other then to say I've played every Civ from 3 on, and the original Colonization, the more modern Colonization based on the Civ 4 engine, and basically everything else including Civ 6."
16771,want to waste many much hours of your day/night? Play this w/ friends

16773,"been playing Civilization since Civilization began. I love the game, I have nothing negative to say that is relevant to a recommendation, I ENJOY this game, as I have enjoyed all the others. I have not played CIV 6 yet"
16774,I like the wide range of mods that allow a person to mold this game to their play style. It's my 'comfort' game for killing time while the world can fuck off. It let's me immerse my brain in things that don't matter so it can reset. Then I can deal with this crazy shitshow we have going on.
16775,sending my men to die brb
16776,Great game.
16777,yeah.
16778,"great game, i love it. Like risk, but more involved and less war based (if you want)."
16779,"Play Civ 6, this one is more buggy then fallout 76 and less balanced then a drunk child."
16780,"It's pretty good, mate."
16781,"doing stuff, making things, dominate the world"
16782,I like this game.
16783,"Massively glitchy without the expansions.  They will not patch it, so you will be forced to buy the expansions to fix it."
16784,Love this game <3
16785,after 500 hours I finally am starting to understand how to play this game
16786,Love it!
16787,Best Civ So Far!
16788,"Better than IV/VI graphics are more realistic, gameplay is better,in fact the whole game is by far the best .Four and Six are hex games,and give that unrealistic interface,which is fine if that's what you want, five is a much more enjoyable experience due to better rendering and graphics.
The flow of the game is another feature,it's less clunky than it's relations,and the game speed is quicker.
Its a pity that the developer is not adding any further sequences, and concentrating on  the cartoon like VI,which is slow and boring.
"
16789,the best game ever
16790,"just yes, now go away steam review stuff"
16791,"It's a great game, it has signs of age, but some will still say it is better than Civ 6."
16792,"Oodles of content, I got this game and all it's DLC for 5$ bucks during it's once a decade sale. Super worth, but Starsector is more fun with more warcrimes."
16793,"Great game with lots of content to rummage through. It's always fun creating a game and playing from start to finish even though it takes a long time to actually complete a game sometimes.

Pros;
- Fun both Singleplayer & Multiplayer.
- Pretty & Satisfying Graphics
- Lot's of Content & DLC
- No Major Issues
- Easy Menu Navigation

Cons;
- Sometimes it can be stuttery, even on a 2070 Super
- Activating Mods can be frustrating sometimes
- Can get quite repetitive if you don't mix your strategy up a bit."
16794,"One of my favourite games of all times. This game has everything, and it's not as complicated as a lot of other turn-based games. 
Nice customisation and it's a good game to hunt achievements in(if you're that kind of person). Comfortable gamin'."
16795,"Poorly optimized, after every turn I have to wait 30 second for everything to load, and it is not because I have a weak PC, I have a beast, apart from that is ok."
16796,nice
16797,"Finally thanx to proton experimental this game works on fedora35 linux.
No special settings mods or commands needed.
I can now try out to see if this game is actually nice to play"
16798,Pew pew pew world domination
16799,"There are a ton of things to enjoy in this game.  However, the combat and AI systems are horrific.  After playing through this game a few times, I'd recommend skipping it.  I haven't had a chance to play later civ versions, however, the extreme emphasis on non-combat coupled with the terrible, aweful combat system means that you end up clicking ""next turn"" for most of your gaming experience.  I recommend choosing a different option.  I have a legacy sweet spot for the civ franchise, but this version, despite it being my 1st exposure to the culture mechanic, i just can't recommend it.  Maybe for $6, but not much  more.  
Cheers,
Caldek"
16800,"I have been playing Civilization all my life and nothing compares to it's fifth game into the series. Had Civ 5 since 2012 and am still coming back constantly for more. Truly a masterpiece of strategy, story and artistic skill. If you have a couple of friends to play with I highly recommend anyone to get this game."
16801,"I mean, I certainly haven't played this game enough to say how well it is, but it is pretty good"
16802,Nuclear Gandhi ftw
16803,"One of the best board games out there.
The charm comes from the real civilizations engaging in plausible, yet absurd hijinks.
Great game to mod.
9/10, can play as native tribes on Mars."
16804,"Games take a while, but they're lots of fun with friends. The different win cons are the best part of this game.
"
16805,Classic quality game
16806,yes
16807,Very relaxing game and fairly easy to get into if you have the patience to figure out a turn based board game. There is a ton of depth to this game so if you get into it there is endless room to grow and build your skills/knowledge to win. I've played it on and off for years and am still learning little things that make the game better. Solid recommendation for a relaxing strategy game.
16808,its fun
16809,pogchamp
16810,"A fun game that'll help you kill a whole days worth of time. The potential this game has is massive thanks to a big modding community, however its a shame that many mods require Brave New World, so your going to have to pay 30 dollars in dlc just to be able to use half of them. A solid game otherwise."
16811,"fortnite alll nite allnite allnmite
"
16812,"i think that Civ V is the most balanced and competitive game in the civ series, civ VI requires bans to properly function as a competitive game and the previous civs are too ancient to do the job.
the no quitters group is lovely and filthy robot made extensive guides and resources to properly learn the game.
i feel like this game also got right how to create great dept with simplicity, and nowadays its extremely convenient for its price/content ratio.
although if you are searching for a better casual experience and don't have problems with spending the money, get civ VI, it looks better and cleaner."
16813,It's pretty neat. civ 6 isn't neat.
16814,Wait its actually good?    Always has been.
16815,Very addictive and fun game and is even more fun when playing with friends for a good laugh I can't even knock the game 100% recommend
16816,good time waster and strategy with a fantasy twist
16817,This is where your free time goes to die.......

16830,"Fun game that's somewhat easy to pick up.

Edit: Get all the dlcs if you can especially G&K and BNW. They add lots of stuff that gives more substance to the game compared to plain vanilla. Highly recommend buying all of it."
16831,very gud
16832,Only played with friends against AI but I love it. More than the VI as the newer one is way too cartoony for me
16833,"challenging without being too hard
"
16834,"Better than Civ 4 (arguably) & better than Civ 6 (arguably)

8/10, would play before Civ 6"

16841,I've just loved all versions of Civ for a couple of decades.
16842,mediocre game
16843,its ok
16844,"Really fun game, has a lot of depth to it and can be played casually. Fun with friends and maybe even family"
16845,"rly good games, yesyes"
16846,why can I write a review when I don't own the game?
16847,"Love it, the Civilization games have always been my fave"
16848,it's alright
16849,fun game that makes you think. to sit relax and play for hours.
16850,fun
16851,It was good
16852,"I mean, it's Civilization. Just one more turn..."
16853,"The best Civ game out of the series. The DLC is almost a requirement though, but you can pick up everything for around $20 on a sale."
16854,A great game
16855,good game
16856,wowcool war in all time
16857,"earrape on startup, classic"
16858,fun game
16859,"Civ V just has the balance of playabilty, religon, use of workers that advanced IV but wasn't diluted by Revolutions (played on PS3 was fine) as is VI. Happy hours still spend years on. God I'm old!"
16860,"Great game, best of the entire series.
"
16861,"Classic turn based strategy, with great DLC and modding community."
16862,"Cid Meier's Crackization V
Return of the ""one more round""
"
16863,One of my favorite games ever.  Every time is different!
16864,"LOVE Civ5! If you can't run Civ6, but you want to play, this is a decent substitute. I own both 5 and 6, and this helps me with my hankering to play Civ"
16865,This game does teach us the art of the deal. For example a kingdom for a horse. Whilst on the surface a kingdom for a horse seems like a biased European Brexit trade deal it is in fact genius. It's genius is almost frightening. Given consideration that the horse is called Freddie Mercury and; can run really fast and; that the kingdom of Vietnam has no luxury resources; and is built on a plain after they for shagged by geography and sun Tzu himself - one is left with no choice but regain their 13 happiness by flogging the hostile Vietnamese warriors for better neighbors. Overall a very realistic game.
16866,Just set an alarm if you need to be somewhere.
16867,"Top game in its kind, historically accurate as well which is cool. Rate this much higher than Civ VI which is more cartoon like where this is more realistic"
16868,I love a good turn based strategy game. Great way to relax and think strategically. It's like chess on another level. The music is also great.
16869,Intensely immersive and addictive game
16870,Best game I have ever played in my life!
16871,Just one more turn.
16872,"This is the first version of Civ I've ever played and it's the one that got me hooked. If you're new to Civ, I'd recommend just beginning with the most current version of the game, but that's not to say the older titles aren't worth revisiting. Civ V to me is the most sleek, well-oiled version of the game to date, and it accurately captures the best elements of the Civ experience in one game. Make sure to get all the DLC if possible, as that only enhances an already amazing experience. Be prepared to lose all sense of time while playing this. If you're into strategy games, or any sort of empire simulator, this is the cream of the crop."
16873,"Good game, but it takes a very long time to play. Not necessarily a bad thing, but if you want to enjoy this you'll need to set aside a decent chunk of time (~10hrs at least) to play a full game."
16874,"Decreased my monkey level significantly, but still pretty good. Variable monkey rate"
16875,Not bad
16876,Civ is good
16877,good game
16878,Amazing 4x game
16879,"It's a wildly replayable strategy game for both new and veteran strategy players alike. The multitude of options, including world type, Civilizations, city states, optional rules and so much more make it impossible to play the same game of Civ V twice. Without any traditional narrative tying it down, you truly feel free to forge your own path and win as you see fit. It becomes especially interesting with the Brave New World and Gods & Kings expansions. Multiplayer is also super fun, and you can scale it for larger or smaller friend groups so everyone is active and interacting with eachother. It's a hell yeah from me."
16880,"Perhaps the greatest game of all time.

There's nothing more to say, except get the DLC too. (at a sale. christ they overprice the dlc)"
16881,"""By my beard and belly,this game is great"""
16882,"This game is great.  I don't recommend playing the sequel unless you like horrible camera angles.  If you hated Civ-Six, give this one a try."
16883,addicting
16884,AWFUL!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
16885,"Quite addictive, just one more turn."
16886,"Best gaim is best,"
16887,It's good. Maybe even a classic but time will tell.
16888,"I've been playing Civilization since civ2. (I was like 4. Playing means mainly watching my brother) This is another great game Civ. The city states are a fun addition, I love the sheer numbers of playable civs, the redesigned religion features, and the incredible mods. (My favorites are ethnic units, which gives almost civ unique unit skins based on historical uniforms, ship lines, ect. and improved ai mod is my second favorite. The AI could use more work, but the mod helps to fix it. If you are looking to try out civ for the first time or upgrade, totally get this game. Its a great game to play while waiting for civ6 to drop in price."
16889,Love the entire Civ franchise
16890,Its pretty good I guess.
16891,Next turn.
16892,xd
16893,all time great
16894,Great turn based strategy game.  1000's of hours of fun.
16895,"Barbarism really speaks to me at my core. I can see myself roaming the lands, causing devastation wherever I go. Laying waste to those who oppose my irrational ways. What a world, what a life."
16896,"It was me, Japan in a tense standoff with my enemy, Korea. We would have gone to war a long time ago had it not been for Vatican City. For centuries my people protected it, until the Koreans came to war one last time. They nuked Vatican City and all it's citizens in nuclear fire. My empire fell that day, but it was a good game.

I would get this game if you want a good strategy game that is simple to start but complex to master while being a fun game to play with friends. The modding community is still very active and continue to improve the game. I would get this game even in 2020 if you don't feel comfortable with the more complex systems of Civilization 6 or if you want something all your friends can play and pick up cheap at a steam sale. The only bad thing about this game is it's really bad net code. If you don't have someone with really good internet to host then you might want to just get Civilization 6, as the net code is better and you will actually be able to play a multiplayer game past turn 50 without the turns getting out of sync."
16897,i can be germany and complete the third reich :)))))))))))
16898,yes
16899,Truly a lovely experience that I return to time and time again.

16901,"I really like this game. For whatever reason, I've played it for nearly 1,000 hours."

16909,"Definitely one of the best games out there, go try for yourself, its very easy to get sucked in."
16910,Just one more turn...

16913,"Great game! Though older, it is one of the best Sid Meyer's Games"
16914,fun game. first turn-taking game I've ever played
16915,This is a game
16916,"Excellent game, played countless times. Prefer it to Civ 6. DLC is essential.

Buy if you can get the lot for less than £20"
16917,Still the best Civ game there ever was.
16918,It's amazing.
16919,turn off everything except conquest victory
16920," Just finished my first game of Civ 5, and i must say it's pretty nice."
16921,"I think the genius of this version is that you can play it as a casual gamer or play it on a really deep level and the experience is just as enjoyable. In early and later versions, this really is not the case. The only thing I feel is lacking (and this is sorted via mods) is only having the one leader per CIV. To me what would have been perfect is including leaders from all the previous games..."
16922,Excellent game for those first to the franchise. Good for anyone looking to try a new turn-based strategy title.
16923,Very fun and easy to learn.
16924,This game is fun in a manner in which you can never stop playing even after you win.
16925,yea its alright
16926,good game
16927,Addicting asf
16928,It sure is a map game.
16929,"its fun if you know how to stratigise 
"
16930,great game to pass the time when bored.
16931,"Seems like a great game but my computer cant handle it...screen continually flickers. my computer did fine with other complex graphics games but not this one, and because I kept the game on for 4 hours, (attempting to fix the problem) I was refused a credit toward something else. Since I cant tell which games will cause this, I'm unlikely to use any video games through Steam again."
16932,"With more than 160 thousand reviews to its name, a lot has already been said about Sid Meier's Civilisation V. The joy of discovering and learning how to play this game has been unforgettable. Even if you don't think it is your cup of tea, you should at least have a sip - I did, and I don't regret it one bit."
16933,Great and Cheap Game.
16934,endless hours of fun
16935,It's the ultimate power trip. Rule a whole nation. Lots of tight stuff
16936,"I play a lot of table top strategy games(Axis and Allies, Risk, and a very novice 40k player), and I grew up in the 90's playing all the RTS games (Starcraft, warcraft, Age of empires, command and conquer ect), I had Civ 3 as a kid but didn't really play it too much.

I'm only bringing this up because this made me believe I have a decent amount of fundamental knowledge to maybe not steamroll the AI, but at least win.

I just played this game for 60 hours in 4 days on prince difficulty and got beat in multiple domination attempts, a diplomacy attempt, and a tech rush. Dude I'm fucking addicted to how many ways I can lose at this game. 
"
16937,Fantastic game. I prefer it over Civilization VI
16938,WORLD DOMINATION!
16939,"i like it better than CIV 6 just becasue I hate change:)  good turn based interaction
"
16940,"One of my most played games for a reason. I love the strategy, implementation and the in game wiki
"
16941,An incredibly involving global strategy game! Worth every hour.
16942,nice
16943,This is the best Civilization game in my opinion. Basically an improved version of the very first one with great graphics and visual style and game play. If you dont know the series it is a strategy game that goes from stone age to the future. It sometimes takes days to finish one session but it is really satisfying and very enjoyable. It is one of my favorite games and I recommend this to anyone who likes round based strategy games.
16944,It's fine.
16945,don't play this game if you want free time
16946,"you can easily waste a week or two playing civ, perfect for your self-isolating needs :)"
16947,"10 years but not getting old. 
Almost ideally polished Civilization, which lacks only a modern look for 2K20; checking out what the current Civ 6 has to offer, I think I can easily skip it and wait for some real next gen stuff."
16948,"Fun multiplayer game! Competitive, engaging and an all time favorite."
16949,I love this game.
16950,right now i cant seem to play the game for reasons im not sure of and is pissing me off to no f*****g end.
16951,its better than eating ass
16952,good
16953,"Very Good game, though the graphics are a bit on the low end for toady it's sill better than Civ VI, a kind of stupid AI though, but hey all AI are stupid"
16954,A big step up from Civ 4 and contains a few systems I prefer to Civ 6. All in all I prefer 6 but I understand why some prefer this iteration to 6
16955,Amazing game
16956,no
16957,"Great game, best civ, but multiplayer networking is pretty bad, especially in the late game (long turns, laggy and buggy unit controls, frequent disconnects in late games)"
16958,"This game is awesome, even more fun with friends."
16959,Best turn based strategy game ever.
16960,"Solid game. It's easily one of the great games out there. It has its issues (crashes, becomes quite slow in late games), but overall it is a must-have. Almost unbeatable if you look at it from a ""price per hour played"" perspective."
16961,"epic, cannot stop playing"
16962,Civ at it's finest. Get this over Civ6 and you'll be a lot happier.
16963,"good game
"
16964,This game is a blast. I always have fun each time I play. Every game is a new experience and I just love it.
16965,civilization V. dota gay lole
16966,Just one... more... positive... review...
16967,"8 years when I first time played this: Epic game, too interesting, caused me playing it for overnights.
2017 after Civilization VI released for 1 year: Civilization V had more in-game players in Steam, Civilization V was the game had most in-game players in Steam.
2020, after 4 years I didn't play this: Still epic, and had 17176 in-game players in this Sunday afternoon."
16968,"Engrossing! You learn ""some history"", resource management and negotiating skills. Tells something about you when you are in control and with power. Not much to say about other game elements but a highly recommended it."
16969,yes
16970,Civ V is still better than Civ VI.  I'm still pissed that both games seem to crash on death match games. Can't you  just use a relational database back end to manage memory and system resources for a serious hard core game? It would be nice if you could fix both games.
16971,"New and improved!! 33% percent more angles!! No more ""Stacks of Doom""TM"
16972,So great!
16973,Better then the new one. yeah
16974," fun game
"
16975,Hexagons? Yessir. 10/10.
16976,"Better than civ 6 even if it's older. Multiplayer has problems from time to time depending on how many people are in your party. Overall I recommend this over CIV 6 for new players, even better, everyone"
16977,"I really don't know what to write, but its pretty damn good."
16978, I like the game
16979,its ok
16980,"game fun, me like alot, me like play poland and kill kill kill jajajajajaja"
16981,Fun game
16982,Can't play as Hitler 10/1488
16983,Great to play with friends :)
16984,Hours of fun!
16985,Its still the best Civ.
16986,Fuck you France. You were my ally. Then you nuked me. That totally wasn't kocher bro.
16987,This game is great with the two dlc. Personally I really enjoy the singleplayer but I also am upset with the fact that they refuse to fix a bug caused by a patch or windows 10 version (can't remember which it is) that stops crossplay between mac and Windows. Extremely unsurprising from firaxis who have a history of only caring about money. Only buy the game on sale with the dlc if you can.
16988,"It is a very great fun game to waste your life on.
Its challenging but not to difficult to play."
16989,Classic game!!!
16990,ghandi is scary
16991,This game is a bit dangerous because it kills a lot of your time without you realizing it.
16992,Just one more turn...
16993,Some of the most fun you can have in a single player game.
16994,"Are you ready for a life-sucking crippling addiction? If no, then this game is not for you."
16995,good game to start on to learn the game.
16996,A good way to burn 8 consecutive hours without noticing
16997,Probably my favorite version to date
16998,"I've been playing this game for years now, not through steam though, its still my favorite."
16999,one of the best ways to make time seem to speed up
17000,"A classic strategy game, that can be played for eternity (or close to at least). Highly recommend if you are into strategy games no matter how old this game may seem."
17001,nice
17002,Its Civ 5
17003,very much enjoyment best one
17004,"I accidentally played for 13 hours straight. If that doesn't let you know it's good, I don't know what will."
17005,Great ass game
17006,"Civ 5.  This game is made for the people who enjoy spending time building and advancing a society close to the point of victory, just for it to be ripped from your grasp by a 36 year old history buff who reads more about how farmers lived during the early 1600's then reading how to advance from his position at Steak n Shake so he can support his alimony paychecks to his kids who want nothing to do with him.  If you are obsessed with investing 6-8 hours of your day to play maybe 2 matches of a game that has no validity over your current day situations, then Civ 5 is designed for you.

TL:DR:  Gud gaem, fuck elizabeth"
17007,It's okay
17008,Game would not  load after the intro
17009,"When I play this game, chances are I play for 6hrs per session, so I like it"
17010,modules make this game bareable
17011,Takes a while to learn but its worth it to witness ghandi destroy your civilization
17012,"10/10 can create my own religion at no personal cost, pretty neat"
17013,I love this game and willingly recommend it to everyone who likes strategy games.
17014,its okay
17015,"enjoyable graphic, similar to previous civilization editions but with fewer cities and units to manage."
17016,"Timeless game in my book. The DLC is highly worth it, the packs add a lot to the gameplay. Very well balanced game. Near limitless options for gameplay customization. Relatively low graphics card requirements make it very accessible too. Civ 5 is the best Civ, in my opinion."
17017,"I have spent countless hours playing this with friends. Win or lose, it's quite the journey when playing start to finish alongside good company"
17018,BEST TURN BASED GAME EVER!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
17019,I tried to get into Civ VI but couldn't.  This is the last one one for me.  It can't get any better than this.  I'll be playing this for the long haul.
17020,very nice like a lot
17021,"its like no other game, it's civ."
17022,I'm only about halfway through my first game but I think this game is a keeper!
17023,Rush india. Rush food. Nuke. Win
17024,"Literally epic sauce, this is certified by Oliver from Low Budget D&D."
17025,It's pretty good
17026,requires big brain
17027,"I'm so close to completing the Sistine Chapel. Just one more turn! Oh wait, only 3 more turns until I can build nukes. I guess I'll stick it out just a bit longer..."
17028,Love the Game and mods for it.
17029,It's alright.
17030,"Good game, not for everyone. i prefer epic or marathon, as they take days to complete, but to each there own."
17031,"If you enjoy any type of strategy/world building game, I highly recommend giving this one a try."
17032,One of the best PC games ever!
17033,BNW is amazing
17034,"Great Game I have played all the Civ's since 1, I also have CIV VI on my ipad. This is by far the best,"
17035,The game is just something to pass the time. Not a winner.
17036,excellent game but always having problems
17037,Intense and complex - decent learning curve though.
17038,I love this game- it is the best version of civilisation I think I have ever played. If they ever announce a remaster to this game I will be first in line to buy it.
17039,"Game's amazing. Really! Like controls are a bit clunky in the beginning, but the gameplay is absolutely mesmerizing. It's obviously best with friends, but it's enjoyable alone. I played the first 30 hours in like a week -- and that hasn't happened to me since WoW or Skyrim."
17040,"As much as I love Civ 5 I've been forced to stop playing, uninstall, and will never buy another 2K/Firaxis product ever again.

Why?

Because you are not a person to them. You are nothing but a milkable cow. The sheer amount of blatant disrespect and outright contempt for you, A PAYING CUSTOMER, is disgusting. After over 5 years of not updating the game, they straight-up BROKE it with a new launcher that's nothing but adware in disguise, shoving advertisements for Civ 6 down your throat every time you try to launch the game - and not even working properly most of the time, no less. Many people have reported that they can't even play the game anymore because of the new launcher. Firaxis knows all about the issues the launcher has, and yet they still refuse to fix it - or better yet, get rid of it altogether and go back to the old launcher that worked perfectly fine.

Before you say ""Oh well there's this workaround or that workaround"" - stop. Shut up. It is not my, yours, or any other end-user's job to fix their shit for them. I did not buy an Early Access game, I bought a completed product, and I will not jump through hoops to play a finished product or to fix the dev's screwups.

Furthermore, their EULA basically strips you of all rights - not just concerning the game (which, as far as they're concerned you don't even own despite buying it), but any and all information they can harvest off your computer about you. Seriously, read the EULA sometime. The amount of abuse their scheming schmuck lawyers wormed into it is mind-boggling. You think Civ 5 is the product? HA, don't kid yourself. YOU are the product. The only reason they can get away with shit like this is because they know most people don't read the EULA when they buy a new product. If more people knew just how anti-consumer and abusive EULAs like 2K's are, not only would people not be buying these games, these companies would straight-up be getting sued.

In summary, I refuse to support these scheming, two-faced, good-for-nothing scumbags, and you shouldn't either. But at the end of the day, it's your money and you are free to spend it the way you see fit. Unfortunately we're seeing the slow death of video games as we know them because most of you are too lazy, complacent, and/or stupid to care what's going on. As long as AAA publisher XYZ gives you your shiny new 32nd sequel that's the same game as last year just with a new name and a new coat of paint, most ""gamers"" these days are all too happy to be abused."
17041,"Its like... a child. You grow it from a wee baby, and expand it into a warrior that you then send off to die. But you've gotta keep in mind that your child doesn't actually matter and then you get bored of it and kill it and make a new one."
17042,"It's very fun when world war happens ... 
"
17043,"Really fun game, and with the modding community it makes it a whole new and fun experience every time."

17055,"One of my all time favorite games. I began with Civ III and have stuck with it through the years, loving Civ 6 and have the Frontier pass. Highly recommended. ^^"
17056,This is the most diggity dang doodlin game that I have played.
17057,It gets a little addicitive after a few thousand hours
17058,"Its a really good game
"
17059,Lovely continuation of the series.
17060,very nice even weeks later
17061,buy it. best Civ game to this day
17062,LOVE CIV
17063,"Best of all the different versions imo. IV is too much micromanagement at the army level with all of the units bring able to stack, which V takes care of by only allowing 1 military and 1 worker or great person on a tile at a time. Vi is too much micromanagement at the city level, with its new city quadrant sections."
17064,fun
17065,One of the best turn-based strategy games I've ever played (don't tell civ 6)
17066,It's fun.
17067,They chose to disable crossplay.
17068,good game
17069,İts best game on the world .
17070,its quite fun
17071,Would be a 10 if didn't crash
17072,Amazing
17073,1 of the best games i've played.
17074,Wasted a huge portion of my high school years on it
17075,Very fun game with lots of nuances and has a lot to be learned - but can be played in easier modes to learn and get better.  No two games are the same and there are lots of ways of winning.  Can be played against 2 or more AI players (or friends that are on steam with a CIV V game account).  Can be played for a few minutes or hours at a time.  A full game with more than 8 players (7 computer AI players) can take days to finish and can change back and forth many times on who is winning etc.  Lots of fun!!!
17076,aw
17077,"A great game with a very serious premise that often leads to incredibly comical scenarios. While every match tends to have its low points and can feel slow from time to time while everyone is working on long-term projects, it's a blast with friends and each game is filled with absurd moments. You don't have to be a master at this game to have wheelbarrows worth of fun with it. Just a few people to play with and a handful of hours to kill."
17078,It is good.
17079,its okay
17080,i like it
17081,Its cool
17082,great way to pass the time
17083,"Classic strategy game, hundreds of hours of game play with tons of variation"
17084,Classic and a great time waster.
17085,i get to play as all my favorite imperialists and murderers :)
17086,good game
17087,very fun game i recommend
17088,Intricate strategy
17089,Fantastic
17090,"Come to find out unless you are willing to purchase expansions, the game is not fun one bit. I'd rather play Civ 2."
17091,yeah it's aight
17092,its fine i guess
17093,"10/10
Massive map with tiny islands is the only true way to play."
17094,good.
17095,Great graphics and music.  Lot's of customizations available.  Good game play.
17096,Its pretty cool I guess
17097,It's alright
17098,Nice Game

17106,"If you're like me and don't want to invest in Civ VI so heavily just yet, then Civ V is the perfect alternative."
17107,plenty of bugs online but fun in single player.
17108,One of the best games ever
17109,"Best Game Ever! Just keep playing and make sure to use custom win settings, otherwise the game just ends randomly because some country kept doing science."
17110,fun

17118,its super good
17119,very good
17120,One of the best Civilization games!
17121,"Very good game. But the best of all Civilizations was No. II. Outstanding ""playability""!! I liked changing  and especially spying the knowledge and discoveries among the nations or evoke a revolt of a city  what is impossible in Civ. No. V. In the Civ. V, there is very poor DIPLOMACY. For example Defence treaty is for nothing. None of your allies will help you effectively when you are attacked by an enemy.
ZVILI, Prague"
17122,what I dislike about this game is you can't change how long it takes to get a tech and how long to produce or build something.
17123,Better than iphone 3g
17124,Crashes after 5 mins of playing. Worked great before i got the DLCs
17125,"Basically the best version of the modern Civ's. For me its basically 1, 3,4 and 5. 2 was kind of weird looking, and 6 is way to simplified/changed."
17126,"pretty legit
"
17127,It's a great game.
17128,Yeah
17129,gud game
17130,"Its civ 5 best civ title made, forget 6 this is the top of the series"

17135,Nice
17136,its good bruv
17137,yes
17138,"Considering Civilization 6? Get this one instead.

I have Civ 6 and both of its expansion DLC's. I have over 100 hours on that game. I tried really, really hard to like it, but in the end, it's just not as good as Civ 5.

TL;DR if you're wanting to get into 4X, empire building games, start here.

Civ 5 has some improvements and some fails compared to Civ 4, but overall it's a step up. This game introduces one unit per tile as well as the hex grid layout of the map, which goes a long way towards creating real tactical movement of your troops and strongly influences what troops you will train to begin with. Plus, terrain is a major factor in combat, especially cities. Lots of hills with jungle or forest nearby? Your siege units are going to have a harder time getting a clear shot, but likewise defending ranged units will have trouble punishing your approach. Protecting your vulnerable units is now a matter of positioning them correctly and not just pairing them with good counter units.

Not all of the civilizations are fun to play, but most of them are, and their unique abilities can offer some drastically different game mechanics. Like Austria, who can use gold to bring a neutral city into the empire, or Spain who gains huge gold and tile yield bonuses for finding and controlling natural wonders.

Compared to both Civ 4 and 6, this game has a clear and clean interface; you always know exactly what a city needs for growth at a glance, and managing production is simple. Likewise it's easy to understand what a tile is going to yield.

Wonders are overall less impressive than Civ 4, where they tend to yield big resource boosts, or Civ 6, where they tend to give you a rare benefit like extra builder charges or a new yield from a certain kind of terrain. Still, having the right wonders for your victory type are a big help.

There are multiple victory conditions, and IMO they each offer a nice variation on how your will play. Diplomacy favors gold production, culture favors city development and the race for artifacts in the midgame, science favors science, and the others favor conquest. And you can win by applying a mix of those things as well.

There is no religious victory, however religion is a strong factor and an enjoyable mechanic. It can provide a major boost to any playstyle and since religious benefits are all unique, it gives you one more set of resources to fight over.

The game represents the best of easy to play, difficult to master that I've seen in a 4X game. If you're wanting to get into the genre, this is your best starting (and maybe ending) game."
17139,Its okay
17140,"Pretty okay. Played a match or two, decent fun."
17141,very very good!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
17142,"I own the sixth installment in the game and honestly, I had to come back to this one. Civ V is the best game of this genre, full stop."
17143,e
17144,Overall good game
17145,its risk but on the computer
17146,"Kinda fun I guess...
Can't shake off the feeling it's an rng fiesta though."
17147,Civ V is a game I love dearly. but after the new launcher was introduced i've gotten constant crashing issues that haven't gone away even after wasting hours troubleshooting the issue. Buyer Beware
17148,Played way too much of it. Just downloaded it again...
17149,x
17150,no
17151,"Really fun game, just sit back relax and play the game :)"
17152,civ 6 bad civ 5 good yes
17153,"Really fun to play with friends. Can be slow, but worth nuking everyone."
17154,good
17155,very epic gamer moments
17156,Fun for hours if you like being the BOSS and if you like to compete.

17171,Really fun game.  I have played every version of this game.  I am looking forward to buying and playing Civ VI.  I highly recommend
17172,great game
17173,Yes.
17174,Great game
17175,Reminds me alot of the civ games I grew up on with so much more possible.
17176,get civ4 instead
17177,"This is one of my Top 5 favorite games.  It also happens to be my favorite 4x game.  The replay value for this game is unmatched.  Combine different nations with different win conditions/goals on different maps and you have new experiences each time.
SIDE NOTE: Civ 6 was not an improvement and Civ: Beyond Earth was basically a re-skin of this game but with less content."
17178,Better than Civ6...
17179,Be ready to give up whatever social life you had before this.
17180,"I don't play much of this game anymore. Not because it's bad, but because it's too good and addictive"
17181,Best Civ game ever.
17182,it is fuckin' great
17183,"I enjoy SMC-V and there are a number of small details I think would add to the game, example...be able to purchase or trade, owned land from your neighbor. Also, the animations are cool so I would like to see more detail, along with more detail in battles in the form of body part hits with ""minimal"" blood and injured warrior units looking and moving as injured etc. As far as the tech. tree goes, anything has room for improvement but all in all, that's fine for me the way it is."
17184,The best strategy game.
17185,yes big epic games victory royale
17186,Trust me I can stop at anytime. Just one more turn.
17187,"we nuke, very nice."

17191,I enjoy this game to an extreme.
17192,its fun ig
17193,Excellent!
17194,gret game
17195,this game is great .can become tense and exciting .search out all the different leaders and achievements .
17196,A great game if you like strategy
17197,tis veri gud
17198,It's good
17199,fun game. good to play by yourself or with friends. reminds me of the board game risk but better
17200,I like that this game gets more and more involved as you go along.  I also can play if I am home and have other things to do at the same time.  I like Civ VI ok but I still prefer Civ V or Civ III over it.
17201,Have been playing Civ since the first one. Love this game. I actually prefer the game play of V over VI. Haven't tried the newest versions as of yet. I tend to play one for years before moving on to another one.
17202,not enjoyable dont recommend. D:
17203,I know Civ 6 is out there.. but it does not play as well as this game.  I hate the world congress in civ 6  also its too cartoony( not a word I am sure..LOL) this animations are better
17204,Best game.
17205,its boring
17206,My man Ghandi
17207,A welcome addition to the Civilization series. A must have for long-time fans and a worthy entry point for those curious what all the hype is about.
17208,"Preserves much of the look and feel of the original, with an emphasis on city-states.  Didn't care for the non-stacking rule and a few other things, but still a winner."
17209,Hate Civ 6 especially the cartoon map but Civ 5 is great.
17210,"Good turn based strategy gold standard very complex
"
17211,great game
17212,"If I had to choose my favorite among steam Civilizations, this would be the one. I find Civ 2 to be the best one, best ever"
17213,"Great game, I love it."
17214,"If you're a fan of strategy games, I definitely recommend picking up this game along with all of the DLCs/expansions. There are plenty of countries to play as and there are multiple ways to win a game. There are also mods that can spice up the game after you play it for a while."
17215,Good game
17216,"Cool strategy game which is easy to learn but yet has a heigh skill ceiling and countless of possible strategies. Mostly fun together with friends, since i wouldn't call the AI's really that intelligent. Now that the DLC's are at a affordable price (in sale) the game is well worth the money.
"
17217,Vast civilization building game that can suck up all of your time before you realize it. Very fun.
17218,goo gam
17219,this game is genuinely really fun. i really like this style game and can spend a whole day from wake up to pass out and feel good about how i chose to spend my day. this game is worth every dollar and hour i spent
17220,i loved the addition of new rulers to the game. it makes it more diverse while also adding new units
17221,This game is wonderful I have spent too many hours playing it. Everything from the movement to the building and settlement control is perfect.

17223,Best strategy game I've played
17224,Honestly a great game one of my favorites. Glad I bought it.
17225,"Great game, Would led Gandhi nuke me again/10"
17226,hey i recommend
17227,"I appreciate the ability to select how I play the game, it allows for a great deal of selection.  One thing I would recommend not doing is the huge map as play really bogs down when you get towards the end of the the game."
17228,"Lot’s of fun, especially with Brave New World."
17229,What more is there to say. Its great
17230,The best civilization ever
17231,This is a good game because its relaxing and makes you think depending on how you wanna play it
17232,"fun game with lots of history.  Not a game for people who are looking for a quick challenge.  most games last a few days, but are very interesting and competitive."
17233,Addicting and fun!
17234,love it
17235,"It's addictive fun.  This version builds on the successes of previous versions with some updates here and there.  I played the game they released after this, and it was not nearly as good.  They made too many changes to gameplay and not for the better.  This, to me, is the ultimate version so far of Civilization."
17236,its good.
17237,yes
17238,"Even if you don't play with mods, Civ V is better than VI in almost everything + without PC bs. I'm coming back to this game every once in a while and it never gets old.
Protip: check 'Vox Populi' mod if you want to extend the fun to over 9000"
17239,I love the variety the game provides and the graphics are pretty good.
17240,It's a fun game that really makes you plan things out.

17249,It's a lot of fun.   It's a great way to practice your strategy gaming.
17250,If u remove the crash problems the rest of the game is flawless and really good quality
17251,"You'll spend a lot of time playing this game if you like strategy games. If you wanna spend your time wisely, do not buy this game."

17255,Its pretty good.
17256,better than civ 6
17257,"This game has challenges and sensible economics. It's fun, especially with other people. Civs 6 could learn a lot from this game. I have abandoned Civs 6 and come back to Civs 5. This is a quality game."
17258,"very good game can spend hours on it

17278,Its coo
17279,It's pretty good.
17280,i enjoy this game a lot because even though you may have a goal it may change throughout the gameplay! i prefer it over civ6
17281,Great Strategy game. A legend of old school games.
17282,"Even though it doesn't have Canada, is a good game. I am glad they added in Civ 6 though, but wish it was here too. Why does everyone usually forget about us?"
17283,"I really like CivV for many reasons.  For one it's just plain fun and you can play it in so many ways.  Also, it's a mini history lesson as well."
17284,it gud heheehee it fun and like there people and this war thingy and its also a little bit of scouts cause there gudddd as well and like its like um has some others stuff like  ... like um right itslike space amd soof

17293,Pure class liii
17294,Very good and fun.
17295,It's an amazing world building and nation building game
17296,great game
17297,It has a little something for everyone
17298,I consider this to be the best iteration of Civilization out there with over 700+ hours of playing to back it up.
17299,really fun tons of hours spent here
17300,is good
17301,Way better than civ 6. I could play this all day everyday and never get bored.
17302,10/10
17303,"deep and strategic empire management, but my only problem with it is that Deity difficulty is a big step up from Immortal"
17304,Great game for strategy!
17305,"A timeless classic TBS that is for the more invested!

Graphics have pleasantly aged to that of a board game. 

Sound engine is average and soundtrack good.

This is a highly strategic title stands up to the test of time and remains a entertaining challenge!

Pricing is on the steeper side and should be purchased on sale."
17306,one of the great strategy games of all time
17307,Civ 5 good game
17308,Best game of the series.
17309,"Yep, it's addictive!"
17310,A lovely game
17311,"Classic.  One of the best interations.  Plays well under heavy turn movement
"
17312,"The last Civilization game I played was Civ 3 and I remember liking it, but it was probably 15 years ago when I last played it. Somewhat recently I decided to buy another Civ game and was torn between 5 and 6, while ignoring 4.
I ended up choosing Civ 5 since 6 looked too cartoony and i'm happy I did because I'm having all kinds of fun with this game and it's one of my new favorite games. I'm currently 300 hours into it and I like the amount of replayability that comes with each game. Each game I start is exciting as I scout and explore and open up more of the map, meet the other AI Civs and adapt to whatever situation the game throws at me.
I'm currently playing a game as Brazil and am locked in a war with Assyria who keeps attacking me with large armies. I initially thought it was game over for me, but one of my towns is on a hill, bordered by a river on one side and a mountain on another. It proved too hard to the Assyrians to take and now I'm counterattacking against their empire after their surprise attack against mine failed.

I haven't gotten into modding yet, but I looked at some of them and several of them seem interesting, that will probably be the next thing I look into in this game.
In the end, I like this game and am happy with it and it's replay value that each new game brings me.
"
17313,This game hit the spot. I was craving for a strategic city building game with warfare elements and this game delivered. I will be playing this a LOT.  very high replayability
17314,Best Civ game
17315,This put Civilization VI in shame
17316,Better than Civ 6
17317,It's a game
17318,"I recommend this game to people that have not tried the Civilization franchise.  Each game in the series has its own unique features, but this game is well a rounded RTS game.  Lots of different things to do and leaders to be with flexibility in game play for hours of continued enjoyment."
17319,"nice game
"
17320,It's layered and has different ways to win and areas to focus on. Really enjoying the game play so far.
17321,"As this is being posted, I do not own any DLC, but I do plan on getting them in the near future. It is a really good game, I do like where this franchise is going with the games. After reading some reviews of the DLCs, I can tell this game is more fun with the DLC content and some of the reviews describe the DLCs as similar to Civilization VI's DLCs."
17322,This is digital Heroin. Just one more turn...
17323,"This game was one of the big things that motivated me at the time to save up and get my own gaming PC. So much fun with every Civilization having their own bonuses, buildings and units. I have so many memories of playing this game with or without friends. Whether i am playing as the English or Ancient Rome, the Inca or the Shoshone it has truly proven itself and its DLC worth the purchase. now i have played it to oblivion i still find myself returning to it once in a while.

It is a classic and a must buy in my opinion.

If you are thinking of buying this game, all i have to say is why haven't you done that already?"
17324,Better than Civ 6 in any way
17325,"I don't enjoy RTS games such as Starcraft or Age of Empires, but I can get into Civ IV as a turn-based game. This game slaps! The base game is alright, totally playable without the DLC but if you have an opportunity to grab the complete package for a decent price you won't be disappointed."
17326,"I Absolutely love this game. Sometimes had a bit of technical issues, and the loading time is sometimes annoying, bute the game itself is just awsome :)"
17327,"The game seems very very complicated at first and to be honest I still learn things every time I play.  Watch a beginner video on youtube.  There is plenty of depth to this game and many different ways to play it.  I would recommend getting all of the DLC as it is worth it and often goes on sale for extremely cheap.  A very good turn based strategy game and it is fun to play alone and with friends.  Just keep an eye on that friend that takes too long with his/her turn.  You can get lost in the mid-game and not know what to do.  Pick a strategy and stick to it.  The AI give a better challenge at the higher difficulties (they are not good at combat however).  The higher difficulties make the AI get production and resource boost (so artificial difficulty).  Be sure to spend time learning diplomacy and keep an eye on the AI as there are signs for when they will go to war with you.  Also, don't play greedy as the AI will likely go to war with you if you don't have a military."
17328,"After 614 hrs of play I've decided I like this game. It's a good mix of challenge and fun.

This is my favourite game of all time."
17329,"A game that challenges the mind and imagination alike. challenge your friends or befriend them in an epic that could last years if you want it to. or challenge the ai to a showdown and see if your worthy of the elusive title. CIv rocks, i thank it for helping shape my taste for stratedy games."
17330,GOOD
17331,"Out of all the Civ series, I find this game far better...even better than Civ6!"
17332,Super fun.
17333,"its good
"
17334,"Love Civ6, nevertheless this is solid to have on weaker computers (i.e. my travel laptop)"
17335,good game
17336,best Civ game out there in my opinion
17337,"Classic Civ game, best with all expansions."
17338,"It's comfortingly familiar, and still good for those of us whose hardware won't support Civ VI. While there are some basic changes to game mechanics, and the help system is quite poorly optimised, this isn't too much of a problem if you've been playing Civ since the 1990s - like me - or have a decent grasp of Google."
17339,P good and fun
17340,Repetitive
17341,amazing game especially with mods
17342,"You know a game is great when even after you 100% it you keep it installed so you can finish reading the Civopedia!

If you waste many hours on Wikipedia like I do, you will love the Civopedia BONUS: no blinding white background.

One con is a frustrating ""Production city glitch"" that all players will encounter during their empire building career. If you have a city that has ""Choose production"" but haven't picked a unit or building yet. 

And if you trade mentioned city away to the AI it will result in a game breaking bug where your turn can not end because you will be STUCK on ""choose production"" phase. The only recourse is to reload an earlier save and if you Oops didn't save enough it will result in a rage quit and object thrown across the room."
17343,yeety
17344,This game is a lot of fun when it gets going and very educational with the encyclopeadia. It is not just a war game it is very involved and takes a while to get the hang of but when playing a good game it is very hard to stay away from.
17345,"''Wait, what time is it?''

*2:00 AM*

''Just one more turn''"
17346,nuke stuff late game
17347,its p good
17348,"Edit:// Original review is below; I've had to change it as I've put more hours into this. There's an absolutely egregious, very common bug that apparently got through playtesting and made it live and has just been ignored since then, and it actually makes the game completely unenjoyable if you play on the biggest map settings on the longest time-scales (which is exactly the kind of thing I enjoy). Normally you tell a worker to build something (like a farm, road, mine, etc) and they take a certain number of turns to complete the task - and it's fine. When this bug kicks in, you have to tell that worker EVERY SINGLE TURN to keep working on that task. It isn't too bad if it's only a couple workers, but when you have to tell 10-15 workers EVERY SINGLE TURN for like 800 turns ""yeah buddy, keep on building that farm, for the 18th time..."" it gets real fucking old, real fucking fast. So I find myself having to withdraw my thumb's up, because it turns what should be a fun turn-based strategy game into a tedius, awful, repetitive, pointless, unnecessarily time consuming monster that isn't even fun. And it's pretty obvious that they have no intention of fixing it, at this point, because they've allowed this bug to persist. Pretty shitty imo. Very disappointing.
________________________________________________________________

So, I don't have any DLC or expansions, but the last CIV game I played was Civ 1 on the SNES.

... when I first started playing this, I was worried about the complexity. The tutorials had SO MUCH TEXT, and there were so many of them.

... but this is literally CIV 1 with nicer graphics. The only real changes are: you see the values for various things that used to be kind of hidden, and the tutorial is much more detailed... functionally, your units have health, so they don't just ""win or lose,"" they gain combat experience and ""level up,"" and they can be upgraded to more advanced troop types when you get new tech, so you no longer need to keep a phalanx on the top of a mountain in 2045 AD. There are probably a few other minor differences - I think you get more options for trading with the AI, but that system seems honestly kind of broken and nonsensical.

Overall, though, you'd have to be some kind of monster to not recommend this type of game - it's just well done strategical fun. I do wish they'd added more and dealt with some bugs, though - but I guess that's what the DLC's are for."
17349,"Amazing game, the complexities and nuances make it near-infinitely replayable!"
17350,pure digital crack
17351,Addictive. Will distract girlfriend for hours...
17352,"Good game, like playing the old Risk boardgame.  Worth the time."
17353,"Its just awesome!  Its like running a real civilization, only you dint die if your country gets tooken over, instead you decide to be ruler of a different civilization."
17354,fun
17355,Good
17356,Its an amazing turn-based strategy game. A lot of Diplomatic options and combat and the dlcs are amazing really like Brave new wolrd and gods and kings
17357,Sid Meyer? Turn based fun!! What's not to like?
17358,"me : I'm just gonna play for 1-2 hours
5-6 hours later : ........................................"
17359,Still a very good game
17360,"This is an amazing game, just play it already."
17361,"Ridiculously addictive. I'm not a huge player of top down strategy games, but this one instils that ""just one more turn"" mentality in you, and you end up playing for hours on end. Easy to pick up and understand, so you don't spend ages reading text boxes before getting in and playing."
17362,A great game that I've played too much.
17363,"""Best time-waster ever"", said fellow WOW raider."
17364,"""We've captured the city, what shall we do with it?""
""Raze it.""
""Very well, but we it still needs to build something.""
""Then build a courthouse while we raze the city!"""
17365,"Great game,had a few bugs but only once or twice.I think it's better then 6,just my flavor nothing againt the 6 itself
"
17366,Great game. If your a thinker and like history this is a gem for you. 5 stars
17367,Very cool
17368,Great game I dont recommend
17369,Someone always ends up salty but fun gaem.
17370,"10 years after buying it, I still play this game often. Can't really recommend it better than that."
17371,it is great to learn how to play the siries.
17372,"It fleshed out the combat far more than civ six, and if you hate how rediculously complex the sixth entry was in this series, you'll love civ 5, it's simpler in a good way, and though not as in-depth with enviorments, the improved combat and better mod compadability, I think it is the best entry in the series. 
(Sorry for my grammar, steam doesn't have auto correct lol.)"
17373,Fantastic Game. Waaaa
17374,good game
17375,I like five better than six. You seem to have more control over pieces
17376,Great game
17377,ya
17378,I always come back to it. Timeless.
17379,gets interesting with friends
17380,Great
17381,good
17382,It is fun.  Ok?  Why are you bothering me?
17383,Best Game!!!  Better than CivVI.
17384,"Its pretty good.
"
17385,"civ 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, doesn't matter, they're all excellent. a must have in your games collection"
17386,"Very good game , i love history geography strategy , this is a very good game!"
17387,"Is an awesome game, need to watch a couple of tutorials to have a complete grasp on everything but is still very recommended."
17388,There is nothing wrong with this game at all.  Endlessly entertaining.
17389,"i played this back when i was around 11, great game. never bought civ 6 tho should i"
17390,Great gameplay and challenging.
17391,"One of the best turn based games I have played.  
I like the discovering of new areas of the world & not knowing where everything is.  I also like developing of technologies in more natural order.  I like how there are more option on how each individual game is played.
What I do not like is when.  When your territory expands, it is random like that actually happened; I'd like to pick which direction or tile my city expands to.  I am not sure who it is that we are paying gold to for acquiring new land tiles. And I did not like the lack of option on how city money was expended.  If I am in a bind in a very high difficulty level game, i would like to save money by not upkeeping roads & let the roads in a city's territory & make travel along those roads slower over so many turns until it is just as slow as if no roads are there or make it become obstacles."
17392,sicmikoyunu
17393,Very nice game!
17394,The most awsome and complete and accurate game so far on the civilization series.
17395,"Civilization V is the best strategic human based game I have found.  Besides being historically and culturally based, it allows the player to be creative, but always requires consequences for decisions.  Because my internet was very poor and because my phone data was capped, I played a lot as a single player against AI.  I am hoping in the future I can begin to learn to play against other live competitors."
17396,civ is one of the best games on steam
17397,Totally unplayable on Windows 10. Crashes every time i try to start the game. I've tried every fix on the web. From updating GPU drivers to reinstalling the game and steam. Nothing worked.
17398,"Its is amazing, best with DLC though"
17399,⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀
17400,Always fun to play All Sid Meier's CIvilization since 1994... Thank you Sid
17401,Top game ever!!!
17402,Gandhi hurt me and everyone wants war for no reason. Great Civ game.
17403,just like the game
17404,i kill
17405,Simply one of the best games ever made.
17406,its ight
17407,it gamey game
17408,Great Game
17409,Still find Civ5 more fun to play than Civ6
17410,This game contains a piece of my soul
17411,"Good game, but definitely a Dad Game."
17412,Not bad so far.
17413,Gameplay and graphics in generall are actually much better than Civ VI. It only looses out in combat machanics.
17414,is excelent chess hitorical game
17415,Sometime when you win co-op multiplayer games people love to cry and they tell my to kill myself *heyi su*
17416,Way better than Civ 6
17417,"Gandhi nuking 3 Civ's way back in my first play through was the best thing i ever witnessed in a video game. Watch out for Austria, they go about claiming every city-state there is in the game xD

One of my absolute favorite PC games. I've had many fun playthroughs and it never fails to surprise me. I have played this before Civ VI and i enjoy playing this more to be honest. Even though i do like Civ VI but i way much prefer its predecessor. 

Absolute 10/10"
17418,"A bland, dumbed-down version of the classic. Go for Civilization IV instead, at least if you're playing against the computer."
17419,Its okay so far.. Still have yet to finish a game
17420,"Good way to spend time.

Check out the modding community and at which point you will never escape."
17421,played this game for years before i got it on this steam account and i love this game as a time killer. I highly recommend the expansions as well they add alot to the game and are a great experience.
17422,CANT PLAY WITH MAC USERS BECAUSE OF MISMATCH VERSION. WASTE OF MONEY
17423,"This game is a masterpiece, I even think it's better than Civ VI. It needs the DLCs to reach its full potential, but since they are not that expensive and you play it for hours and hours it is worth every penny in the end."
17424,"Added a ♥♥♥♥ing launcher that relaunches the game 3 times before it enters, good job, after it's out like 10 years."
17425,It's a good game.
17426,"This game is super addictive and honestly the biggest time waster in my life!  My favorite Civ game used to be CIv 2 Multiplayer Gold, and i refused to move on from it because that game is so amazing in itself.  But i decided to take a chance and finally play a newer Civ game and let me tell you, i have been missing out!!  My friend bought me this 3 years ago and i haven't played it till now, but i am loving it! This game is so amazing that it makes me question why i never started playing this sooner!  

Overall, if you have a lot of time to kill, definetly give this game a shot!"
17427,its highly addictive
17428,best game ever
17429,it's civ doing civ things.
17430,noice
17431,"Civilization V keeps everything that makes the series great, makes the game more accessible to non-fans, and overhauls many of the finer gameplay details. Every gamer owes it to himself to give this game a shot."
17432,"The Civ games are the League of Legends of strategy games, but unlike League, they're good."
17433,v good
17434,"Fantastic game that you can easily sink hours of time into, many different ways to play in both single and multiplayer modes"
17435,Play the Vox Populi mod at civfanatics for a living game with much enhanced rules and AI!
17436,Great game that's hard to stop playing - not in a boring way.
17437,"Better then Civ VI IMO. Fun, straightforward game which can be as easy or difficult as you wish. Comes from a time when games on 'hard' difficulty were actually hard!"
17438,Best Civ game by a large margin. An essential game for fans of strategy.
17439,unstable! got pumped out into a small window session and keep doing this many times despite reboot!
17440,The best Civilization there is! Hundreds and hundreds of hours played. 10/10
17441,"Way better than Civ 6.
Dont even bother with Civ 6, I got civ 6 for free and I am sad about wasted 6gb of internet traffic that I used to download it. And I have unlimited access.
Civ 5 is just better."
17442,could be better if thet added total war style gameplay to the story.
17443,simply one of my personal favs!
17444,"awesome game best civ game out there. base game that is, expantion that brings religion  ruins everything. i have it but never play it. easy fix  make it where you can completely disable religion, omg how anoyying it is. but everything minus the religion is amazing. i tend to just stick with the base game, it is so much fun. ai teamates sure, three on three four on four, whatever floats your boat."
17445,fun..
17446,good
17447,"good
"
17448,"Gran juego, el mejor de toda la saga diria yo."
17449,I never thought I'd like these sort of games. I do like these sorts of games. Lots of different unique scenarios across play throughs.
17450,The game is hung. 10/10 would recommend.
17451,It will take 216 hours of your life in the best way possible.
17452,Best Civ!
17453,My favourite Civ! not too complicated like the 6th version. Everything is just right here. Love it!
17454,Diewithpride has played this game. Cannot recommend.
17455,Better than civ VI. :)
17456,Pretty buggy and lots of terrain glitch
17457,"Out of all the civ games, this is the one I keep coming back to. It looks gorgeous on all of my computers, and I really feel like it's the best in the series. Grab it!"
17458,Better conquest games than other Civ games.. Highly enjoy expansion
17459,
17460,"When you say ""just one more turn"" every 5 hours..."
17461,fun game to build your empire!
17462,"Best game I've ever played, teaches so much about the delicate nature of global politics and the small things that can set things off."
17463,It's decent
17464,spent alot of time with this  if you are expecting a major fanfare in the end victory  dont it is one of the most dissapointing things   is it even worth it??
17465,"Not a short game, but even just playing against the computer is a blast let alone having 24 hour games with your friends in a LAN. The game isnt complicated but strategy is key when playing against others or higher difficulties. Strongly recommend (played almost 1000 hours of this game)."
17466,.
17467,"The most accessible Civ  series ever,  I've try the next civ series, but get annoyed by the cartoon look of visual and too much of aggressiveness of the A.I which makes the game play more like ordinary 4x strategy rather than Civ of the world competing together. So if you look for more accessible Civ game and the feeling of competing with civ opponent choose Civ V instead rather than spend money and much more expensive Civ VI."
17468,"This game is great to play alone or with friends but the multiplayer can be buggy at times and if you get bored of the civilisations that come with the game you can download new ones from the workshop.

A mod I recommend if the Earth 2014 which has the leaders of many of the larger countries and is set in the modern day."
17469,"Civ V has an addicting gameplay to it, that had me playing for over 280 hours. Civ V also is the best game in the Civilization franchise. Even though it'll turn 10 this year, the graphics are on par with today's standards. I have Civ III-V on Steam and V is my favorite. The engine and graphics are unique to civ v, as civ vi doesn't use them. This game is easily one of the best games of all time in my opinion."
17470,Best game ever!
17471,I played Civilization for decades. And it is still an addicting strategy game :-)
17472,it is good
17473,fun with friends
17474,Good stuff.

17479,yes
17480,"That's a good game. Very difficult at the last level, but good."
17481,v good
17482,A good battle game that is different every time you play it.  Good help files.  Good beginner tutorial.
17483,Definitely a thousand times better than Civ 6.  This is the kind of Civ game I love and this one has so many addons and mods that are fantastic it is worth buying over the newer Civ game
17484,"Beware, any installment of Civilization can steal your life!"
17485,"The essential Steam game.

 Very fun and extremely easy to pick up and play. Not difficult to lose track of time while playing so you may be playing for a couple of hours accidentally. Runs decently on any system/laptop from the past 10 years."
17486,"(•_•) ( •_•)>⌐■-■ (⌐■_■) APPROVED
"
17487,"Back in the day, I played a lot of Civ 2 and Civ 3.  I took a long break from games and don't even recall if I even played Civ 4.  So recently, I had Civ 5 sitting in my library and decided to give it a go.  

And ah yes, the old staying up way too late to play ""one more turn"" is back!  Like previous versions, there is a ton of depth to this game and a steep learning curve which may seem overwhelming at first.  Luckily though, the game has 8(!) difficulty settings (one of the best features of the Civ series imo), which allows for all levels of skills and experience and will let you find one that is the perfect mix of comfortable while challenging as you slowly learn all the ins and outs of the game.  And as always with Civ games you can get super micro-managy and control what each of your citizens and workers is doing or you can let the game manage much of it for you, another strength of the series. In addition to the other civs that you're competing against, Civ 5 adds non-competing city-states which I wasn't sure if I liked at first, but now that I've played a bunch of games I'm enjoying the flavor that they add.

And finally as always there are four ways to win a game of Civ which along with the many different maps and civilizations (each with its own personality, and watch out for that Ghandi fellow) provides a virtually infinite variety of games for high replayability.  Each game of Civ 5 you play will have its own unique style and story that unwinds as it plays out.  Some games will be very militaristic and bloody if you get a lot of aggressive civs in the mix. Others will be a race among civs to develop economically, culturally and/or technologically or to woo over the city-states, all with the end goal of some form of domination. Highly recommended -- just don't start a game too late at night or your sleep may suffer."
17488,better than 6
17489,Wait! Just... one... more... turn...
17490,INDIA OP
17491,"Best strategy game on steam...even a toaster can run it
"
17492,"This was actually the first Civ game I ever played, I became interested after seeing a lot of let's play style videos on YouTube and decided to try it out and it's still pretty fun even with Civ 6 now being out. Even when I used to have a potato gaming PC it still ran pretty well which was nice and runs smooth as butter on my current rig. I'd definitely recommend it if you feel like trying it out and like this type of game in general."

17495,great mechanics

17497,it's good i guess

17499,everything perfect
17500,its p cool
17501,very gud
17502,Bought it in 2011 and played a bit. It's alright..
17503,Amazing strategy game if you have like 20+ hours to burn on a match
17504,"In my opinion this is the best Civilization, buy it with the Brave New World expansion for maximum enjoyment. Just one more turn ..."
17505,"This game is fun play it, gmaer!"
17506,im scared
17507,Just buy it already lmao
17508,"Better ingredients, better pizza, Papa John's"
17509,It's fun
17510,Fun and addictive.
17511,"They vastly changed the series with this game and i do not approve.
"
17512,Decent game
17513,You can nuke people 10/10
17514,"It's a fun game. You play it, you click next turn then eventually hours pass and you don't even realise it."
17515,"Best Civ in the series, by far"
17516,Ghandi will mess you up. Do not cross him.
17517,"In a day when toxic online culture and virtue signalling game companies invade your entertainment, Civ 5 is a breath of fresh air. Endless replay potential."
17518,"Tgis game offers a solid path to modern goals aside from was, but is ar its best on the battlefield.  Its division-level play is spellbinding."
17519,pretty pog
17520,Very good strategy game
17521,"I really enjoy it. The mods make it endlessly fun. I prefer it in many ways over Civ VI, even if it is lacking in a few elements I enjoy from the successor."
17522,"one of my best favorite game, i prefer far more civ V then civ VI"
17523,had it for like years
17524,
17525,Great game.
17526,"Good strategy game, Once you understand all the mechanics it turns into something really fun.
But without the DLC´s it feels a little incomplete."
17527,get all the expansions when everything is on sale
17528,great stuff
17529,nb
17530,A gold standard for turn based multiplayer games. Get it.
17531,Better than Civ 6
17532,"There's a reason this is my most played game. This game is risk, but advanced (but if you're here, I'm sure you already knew that). Chess, but 1000 pieces. But it can be so much more than risk. It's risk with house rules.

- Exploration
- Colonization
- Diplomacy
- War
- True Conquest

Every game is a story and every game is different, and the modding community takes this game to the next level. It's a board game only capable of being fully realized on a computer. 100% worth it.
"
17533,Terra Nova
17534,Pretty good. Worth picking up.
17535,"easy to play, many ways of setting up the play and a lot of fun
"
17536,"Its fine, I guess."
17537,fun game
17538,The game's pretty good
17539,yeah this is definitely a game that will stand the test of time in my book. (looking at you civ VI)
17540,Game good
17541,This is  as good as the original Civs and much better than VI..  It plays well and there are many choices and variations to choose from.  It also plays very well with others in what ever level you and/or they want to play.
17542,It's ok
17543,"Please stop being so addicting.

Also faster AI turns would be nice."
17544,Challenging but still lots of fun
17545,Great game.
17546,"I enjoy the game, but have a few problems. It has crashed 3 times in one day; I can't get the Chariot Archers to attack the Barbarian fort.... no idea what I am doing wrong. I am a new player, played only 10 hours."
17547,"For an older game it's really fun and well made.  May seem intimidating at first, especially if you're new to civ, but after a single play through you will get a good understanding of basic strategies.  Definitely worth it."
17548,Love this game!
17549,I've fallen for this game. I've put so much time into it. It has an easy learning curve yet the strategy and mastering of the game leaves room for complex play.
17550,"Very good, but sometimes annoying"
17551,great
17552,"i love this game. its not to complicated, and is very fun to play. with add on's there are a plethera of choices and if you go to advanced set up its even more choices. i really wish it had serious dialog though the game is quite limited in what you can say to other countries , even if you are friends. also getting the different units is super exciting. trying to beat others countries to certain wonders is always a thrill."
17553,It's OK i guess
17554,"With the Vox Populi mod pack (findable in google, not the workshop), this game is a great experience. Couldn't go back to a bad AI in Civ 6 after this. Hopefully after all expansions and updates are released Civ 6 will get a similar mod pack."
17555,Must-play for TBS lovers.
17556,It's okay.
17557,"This game has an insane level of replay value. You can play this over and over and over because each game is different and there are so many different things you can focus on each time you play. You can focus on science, religion, culture, finances, military, city-state relations, border expansion, production, etc!!. It's quite literally your choice. What makes this game really challenging is when you focus on one thing, you often have to account for others. There are so many different ways to win the game. Cultural, religious, conquest, science, diplomatic, and time. 

I would HIGHLY recommend you play this game if you like turn based strategies and as a bonus, you like geography, history, or politics. 

Also, if you buy this game, get the gods and kings expansion, and the brave new world expansion. They add a LOT of extra things to the base game like trading with other civs which greatly increases cashflow, religion, ideologies in the social policy, and tourism. Wait until they go on special though as they are a bit pricey.

I don't know what flaws I've encountered while playing the game. I've played this to death and quite honestly any flaws that I could find, don't even matter since the game is just waay too good to give a damn about it.
"
17558,Excellent playability! If you like turn based strategy you can get none better.
17559,Very fun addition to the legacy of Civilization games.
17560,"Only game You can play for hours with friends, fall asleep in the middle of it and your friends probably have done the same."
17561,"If you've played Civilization before you know what you're in for. I'm not a Civ veteran so I can't get into the nitty gritty of whether it's better than IV or a sufficient upgrade or stuff. But I know it has the same ""one more turn"" feeling, same great soundtrack, and the slow growth into marveling at your vast empire at one point. 

The core of Civilization V is still here and it's just as great as I remember. If you're reading reviews for Civ V after this long, it's cheap enough to definitely be worth a purchase. Get it with the Brave New World DLC. Adds a ton to the game."
17562,Gandhi
17563,I may not be that good at the game but HOLY SHIT BEST GAME EVAH BAYBEE
17564,you can lose track of time really quick.
17565,My favorite game. I love the strategy and the expansion added alot of depth to the game.
17566,"Exceptional Game with a thriving modding communities, The DLCs are worth it too"
17567,"After about 20 years of playing almost nothing other than StarCraft and Diablo II, I took the plunge into more modern gaming this year. Civilization V is a highly engaging game, plenty of cool things to do, and it does not require lightning-fast reflexes or a controller. It's probably good for any player, but definitely a good choice for casual gamers like myself."
17568,SO much better than 6.....
17569,"been playing since 4-5 years ago, now i decide to buy it on steam to appreciate the greatness of the game. Just buy the game, you don't need to read the review."
17570,Countless Hour of Replay Value And the game only gets better with multiplayer. With ALL the DLC this is a game I would Highly Recommend.
17571,Yes
17572,honestly I was sure I wouldnt enjoy this game but it's been one of the best games ive ever played I love every minute I play this game
17573,Great game. This is way better than VI.
17574,Better than CIV 6
17575,10/10 would nuke pacific dehli again
17576,"I'm starting with CIV, for the moment great game."
17577,Civ 5 had to do after they patched my civ 6 exploits. Until I can find more this game is better.
17578,"great game, replayability is there"
17579,"worst game ive personally ever played, nothing to do, 0/10, would not recommend"
17580,i is fun bro
17581,"I liked when I won. I never dislike, because I never lose."
17582,"A friend got me into this game. The tutorial isn't the best at explaining things, but the game has been out long enough for there to be some good guides. Apparently it's pretty similar to other Civ games? I wouldn't know.

I've only played a few games so far, but I've already experienced the strange phenomenon of saying ""one more turn"" at midnight,  clicking a few things, and realizing it's been four hours, and the sun is coming up. It's like a casino. Set a timer, or keep a clock visible and nearby."
17583,i played this for so long i forgot to pay the power bill. when they cut the power i lost the save... goddamnit
17584,Favourite RTS on the market. The visuals and options within the game are awesome. If you love RTS that you can play solo/with friends and always have a different enjoyable experience each time you play- Civ 5 is the game to play.
17585,Very entertaining.
17586,"[h1]Civilization V is one of the best turn-based strategy games I’ve ever had the pleasure of playing. Whether teaming up with my friends for some multiplayer, or simply losing a whole night of sleep to the game’s endlessly replayable single player, this is one game that any strategy enthusiast, or, hell anyone strat-curious should check out. 

Sure, I miss some of the deeper inter-civilization relations that the more defined religion and government setup brought in Civilization IV, but that’s nothing anyone new to the series will even think twice about. With all the tips, advisers and tools in place, this is the first Civilization for PC that I feel is worth just about every person’s time. Go forth and create, subdue, and exploit. Do as Firaxis has done, and bring Civilization to the masses."
17587,Absolutely love this game.
17588,It's cool
17589,"Bro, just one more turn."
17590,Way too addicting once you get a good game rolling.
17591,Great gameplay
17592,great game
17593,Great game
17594,Yes.
17595,its aight
17596,"Enjoyable strategy game that has you learning the mechanics and guessing the opponents next moves. It's not a game I would play for more than a few hours at a time, but it will sure get you past a lecture."
17597,+
17598,yes
17599,Like everything dislike nothing
17600,If you start a game you'll be there all damn day and night finishing it.
17601,"Great game, I like it better than Sid 6 to be honest, not perfect though."
17602,game good
17603,ghandi hurt me feelies
17604,"It's VERY good! Nothing else to say, really."
17605,"there is a reason why i have over 1300 hours in a game that isnt tf2

very cool grand strategy also the mods are not bad

dlcs make the game 200% better, price is a bit high normally but highly recomend to buy when on sale

"
17606,"played this for like 3k hours on the disk, it is fun"
17607,Game good
17608,"One of my favorite PC franchises. Game is not for everyone, but if you like to take a methodical approach to strategy based games this is for you."
17609,"Buy when it's on sale so you get the dlcs. Honestly, better singleplayer because you get mods and in multiplayer the first person to get Temple of Artemis and Fertility Rites kinda just wins. Good civs are Egypt, Venice, Japan, Babylon. All of them are good in their own way except for a couple, but you just ignore the bad ones. Very solid game."
17610,Best Civilization sequel so far is Civ 5! Customization is still king to which Civ 6 still needs to live up to. Developers need to learn not to remake a wheel and to listen to the masses more often (no puns intended). Civilization 5 is the best overall experience of the sequels
17611,Better than Civ VI.
17612,Great Game.  Infinite replayability.  Games can last days and days and never gets old. 9/10.
17613,"If you love the civ franchise, this is a good installment."
17614,Godly.
17615,Its ok.
17616,good game
17617,bumba
17618,One more TURN!!!!
17619,very nice

17622,01231032
17623,
17624,"this game hasn't worked in months. this is because of a f launcher.
The game as such is abandoned by the devs."
17625,"I think I have finished about every 10th game of Civ V that I've started.
I have never played multiplayer with random people online, only with friends. We still almost never finish our games.
And it is still one of the best games to keep friendships running, especially in Corona times."
17626,good game
17627,"i like big frigates and i cannot lie. 9/10, could use more naval customization options."
17628,This game is addictive as hell.
17629,This is the best game I ever played.
17630,"Amazing game, put in many hours with the girlfriend. Each game goes differently, style of play changes depending on your civilization, and you learn to adapt to changes as they come. The more friends you have who play this game, the better it gets!"
17631,great long term project game
17632,This game is best played with friends but is still an extremly enjoyable ride to experiance yourself. The only thing i dislike about this franchise is the lack of customization.
17633,"Just got this game yesterday, enjoying it so far"
17634,i was paid one billion dollars to play this. it sucks
17635,Fun game to play alone or with friends.
17636,"fire game
"
17637,its fire
17638,it's ok i guess
17639,alek please come back im sorry
17640,awesomeness!
17641,I can't tell you how many hours I would put into this game while working.  We had a LAN at work where we would take turns on breaks or when it got slow.  Hundreds of hours of play.  Endless combinations.  A great game even now.
17642,is good
17643,It's extremely easy to get wrapped up in this game! Fun and addicting.
17644,Not really that fun of a game once you have bought it...
17645,It is a good game AND IT IS FUN. although HAPPINESS IS ANNOYING.
17646,"If you like turn based strategy, you already like Civ games."
17647,Wide array of military units with unique capabilities makes each civilization fun to play.
17648,"Not an improvement or good sequel. The hex system only seems to gimp the AI further. The graphics are pretty but the map and overall personality of the game don't come alive compared to Civ4. It also marks the beginning of bad DLC behavior that's become the new norm.

Even if you think I'm totally wrong, only worth checking out when it's on sale."
17649,its civ
17650,i love this game. its addictive!
17651,"good
"
17652,"I feel that this was the pinnacle of the Civ series.  This series is the most detailed version of Chess, ever made."
17653,Awesome game!
17654,It's ok I guess
17655,"Best Game I own, no contest."
17656,
17657,Lots of fun. Make sure it's on a SSD. Makes a huge difference in this game.
17658,It's good
17659,pretty good game
17660,"Good turn-based, strategy game.

If you like to build an empire and watch as you destroy or get destroyed by other players, then this is the game for you!

Only problem I have is finding people to play with me. :D"
17661,sans
17662,Gandhi nuked me...
17663,I've played Civ 1 to 6. Civ 5 is the best Civ by far. True to the original game play in Civ 1.
17664,"really good time-consuming game! recommend to install ""community balance patch"" mod, which greatly improve the game"
17665,...
17666,"I've spent 75 hours converting the entire world to judisme, starting multiple nuclear wars, enslaving city states to do my bidding and slaughtering countless Barbarians for enslaving my workers. Do i regret it?

No

17667,fantastic game and true to the original game all those years ago
17668,Based game if you're looking to avoid being productive
17669,"Buy it and play a couple turns. If you don't like it after a couple turns, just play a few more turns. If you still don't like it, just play one more turn..."
17670,This game is good.  - me
17671,its all right
17672,this is an amazing grand strat game and sometimes really funny from how weird it can be.
17673,I bought this game for 10 dollars 4 years ago and now it is 150 dollars. Great company. Hope they crash and burn. Disgusting.  Also the same can be said for CIV 6.
17674,This game is basically cocaine but way more enjoyable and with twice the impact to your social life.
17675,"Sat down to play game. Just a few turns. Looked down, looked up, and 8 hours has gone by. Send help."
17676,"Great game with progression and technology advancement, check out the mods if you want something slightly different from usual civilizations or slightly different game play. I've racked up quite a few hours on the game and will continue to rack up more. I bought this on sale for the complete package which I would recommend, had I paid full price I may have been a bit upset about it"
17677,very hard to win
17678,"easily one of the best modern strategy games ever made, there's a reason people still prefer this game over most; over 10 years after it's release."
17679,10/10 with DLC
17680,"I cannot not get the game started once I get past a certain point.  Its as if Steam does not enough download capacity to start the game.  Even when I purchased a $1300 machine with a large download cache, it did not solve the problem.  I contacted Steam help and  spent lots of time with them and that did not solve the problem."
17681,"Great for strategy gamers, even good for RPG gamers who want a break from the slaughter."
17682,Lost 7 hours first go. Amazing.
17683,"I still come back to this version of Civ, I prefer the mechanics to VI."
17684,bom jogo
17685,This game goers deep enough in depth strategically to be interesting and captivating.   It also does not go to in depth as to ruin the game experience!   I love it!
17686,"this is more for those city builders out there, ive played the original civrev for playstation 3 and xbox and i have to say that the series has come a long long way with everything thats changed and been added in these games because the graphics are awesome, the game play is awesome and the way you win is pretty darn sweet too, i cant complain really because i originally ran this game on a laptop granted it was an hp laptop but it still ran the game with no problems an honestly if you have one that does that youve got a good pc because most cant handle games like that on them theyre just not made to hold them unless its a gaming computer which mine at the time was not so i have to give the ol girl props for holding this an running it as smoothly as it did but still yet this is a great game to play if youre into those kinds of games because you can basically have your civilization the most advanced tech wise or culture wise or if youre really good you can do a combo lol i dont recommend the combo though because that can slow you down in terms of turns an tech if done incorrectly so you gotta have a strategy for these kinds of things but i do recommend this game to anyone that wants to play games like this because it is totally worth it and fun all around granted i miss a few things from the original but hey its still a great game to play"
17687,Keeps me mindlessly entertained for hours after heavy days of research and writing.
17688,Always good to play
17689,10/10 would get bumrushed by 3 Deity AIs again
17690,"This game set the standard for strategy PC games, a true classic. My son and I still prefer to play CIV V with expansion packs over CIV VI. But we also miss some aspects of CIV IV. Steam allows you to play it in Windows, Mac, or Linux environments (Linux can be hit or miss, depending on the distro and hardware)."
17691,yes if you like to play a long game
17692,v cool
17693,Would you be interested in a trade agreement with England?
17694,I LEIK GAME
17695,Nice game very addicting
17696,8000+ hours played 10/10 would recomend
17697,"Great game with DLC, great value when on sale."
17698,"Great replayability, especially with mods"
17699,it's all good.
17700,So cool
17701,350 hrs into this game and i'm still playing it... civ 6 didn't do it for me.
17702,"Don't let my play time fool you. I've been playing this game since 2010, but thanks to Games For Windows bricking my original hard copy of the game because of an email mixup, I had to buy the digital version of Civ 5 a few years ago.

This is probably my favorite version of Civ. Civ 4 is a close second though, with Civ 6 coming in third. Civ 5 feels the most like the old school games circa Civ 3, and the graphics and strategy are better than all the other versions, in my opinion. Civ 6 is fun and I own that on my consoles as well, but the cartoony graphics are a bit tame compared to Civ 5's more ""serious"" tone. I do love the fact that my builders don't expire unless captured by the enemy, which is a big plus compared to only getting 3 or 4 uses out of my builders in Civ 6. I also found the music to be superior in this game; about equal to the quality of music found in Civ 4. The narrator is cool in Civ 5, but nobody beats Leonard Nimoy narrating the game in Civ 4.

Of all the Civ games, 5 just feels the most solid in terms of gameplay. The DLCs made more sense in Civ 5 than the odd directions that they are taking the DLCs in Civ 6, which feel a bit forced to me, not to mention way overpriced. If you're going to start with any Civ game, Civ 5 is not a bad place to start at all, and don't be surprised if you stick with Civ 5 and forget all the other ones, because Civ 5 was the closest that Firaxis ever came to a perfect Civ game."
17703,Good strategy game.
17704,"Epic game, can sometimes be even more epic than civ 6."
17705,"Somehow Civ V is the game of Civ series that I palyed the longest. I`m trying to play VI on Xbox, but I always find myself loading Civ V on PC."
17706,Good game.
17707,"Just play civ 5, why do you need this civ 6 wich is cringe?"
17708,This is one of the best games I've ever seen
17709,"good
"
17710,This game was the firmament of my young childhood. I love it and you'll love it.
17711,better than civ 6
17712,"You spent hundreds of hours on this only to have a tip of the iceberg of the game, a peek of human's civilization. Next turn."
17713,^.^
17714,Always good to conquer without too much brain cells !
17715,fun
17716,great game for a chill laxing game!
17717,"Civ V is an online gaming classic, and for good reason. It boasts massive replayability, enjoyable multiplayer, and a bunch of interesting ways to win. Each game is a huge time-sink, but the investment is easily worth it."
17718,Rule the world. What's not to like.
17719,good
17720,"Having played Civilization (1), Alpha Centauri, and Civilization (3), I can say I truly love this version.  The graphics, the interaction online or on a home network and the goals to achieve keep this game going for a long time."
17721,"Great Game,"
17722,This game will take your soul and lock it in a deep dark box until all you can think is One.More. Turn.
17723,"The game is very much playble, but with a few bugs and flaws.

It's 32-bit, so whenever it comes close to using 1.7-1.8 gig memory, it crash and any saved game just before that point will fail to load and say the save is corrupt. I have 64 gig ram, it feels really winXP'ish when a game this recent can't handle more than 2 gig but obviously need to.

After a while, black artifacts start flickering across the screen. When that happens, save game, exit the game completely, then start and reload the save and it works. This typically happen once or twice per game, so it's just an annoyance and not a big issue.

With a 4K monitor, the game should be run in a 1920x1080 window, as it bugs out too much in 4K.

""We love the king"" and other icons on the right side often get stuck and can't be removed even with a save & reload.

The loader always crash if ""play"" is clicked before all useless spam videos promoting civ6 haven't finished downloading first.
"
17724,Yes
17725,"Civ V is a solid 4K strategic game. 
I can recommend it, but only under few conditions

Firstly, in order to fully experience the game you need to buy all major expansion(I'm talking about Brave new world and Gods&Kings). I really think that's necessary, without them gameplay looks dull and plain. About 50% of game mechanics are included in those DLC's.

Secondly, make sure that you have quick combat and movement turned on in your settings. Also use every possibility you have to speed up your game. The longer the session last, the worse it is for your mental health.

Finally, it's good to have some friends to play with, in co-op or competitive, 
their presence helps to pass through boring late game.

PS:
And I know that Civ VI is already out, and that it was even given for free on EGS, but after all [u] I consider Civilization V is a better game than it's successor. [/u]"
17726,"[quote]""Wait wait, just one more turn!""[/quote]

That's the message the game shows you after you win a map. Sounds like it is a joke, but it is... right on, actually. What starts as a mess of seemingly infinite choices to make when building up your empire from 4000 BCE down to year 2500 will end up with... well, you not wanting to end it.  

You choose a historical leader such as Washington, Ghandi,  Boudicca, Nebuchadnezzar or Alexander (there are 43!) and guide your civilization throughout history. Each leader has one special ability or bonus and can train either two special unit or two special buildings (e.g. only Alexander may train the famous Greek Hoplites; only the Ghandi may build Mughal Forts). Experienced players may build a strategy around those features, but novices can instead focus on the rest. ""The rest"" is just:
- settlement and management of cities on strategic locations
- management of happiness and economy of the empire, including trading routes with other nations and states
- culture management and tourism
- well... war, of course
- determining the technological and social path of your civilization
- building of wonders and infrastructure on cities and its surrounding
- obtaining and trading luxury resources
- religion funding and spreading
- none, some or all of those while playing one of the historic scenarios

The game is so complex with so many potential for micromanaging one or two aspects of it, that you can immerse yourself, allowing time to wrap and those ""I'll just play for 20 minutes"" will turn out to be 8 hours straight - no jokes, that was my first Civ5 sitting.

Moreover the game has SO MUCH TO OFFER that people easily get lost in what to do next; in this case, you can just take a look into the 286 Achievements. There are some high tier challenges there with 0.5% completion rate and some seriously tough achievements on Deity difficulty (max). Plus: Linux native support for more than a decade, never faced any trouble here. THANKS ASPYR.

The only downside of the game is that you'll get the aggro of your partner/wife/husband once the opening video plays. They learn that they lost you for several hours once that vignette plays."
17727,"Great game, better than CIV VI"
17728,"Good balance, but not too complicated."
17729,"Honestly the best Civ game out there, its at a good price and runs great on most PCs. The game doesn't even seem aged at all. Definitely a good challenge and a game you can't get unhooked from. Recommend to everyone!"
17730,"Very addicting game once you get the hang of the rules and different strategies. My only complaint is that it's hard to walk away from it once you start a game, and each game can be several hours long!"
17731,great game
17732,nice
17733,its good i guess
17734,Everything you'd expect from a Sid Meier's Civ game.
17735,Everything you'd want from a turn based strategy game - I think the only negative is that it can eat up so much of your time compared to other games! But is my all time favourite.
17736,it's great
17737,"Got this game in 2012,me and my husband still play it regularly. I will never be ""finished"" with this game."
17738,10/10
17739,.
17740,A good turn based strat game.
17741,good fun single player game
17742,"Once I thought it was a good game, with great graphics, enjoyable game play, and more than once I said to myself this turn I will turn it off and go to bed, it had me anticipating the future games, wanting new things that were improvements upon the game, so when the next civ game came out I preordered which I never do.

But when I played the next civ game the graphics were that of a free mobile game, the game play as enjoyable as chewing nails, and with that I had an even greater apreciation of Civ V and it is one of my favourite games ever."
17743,"It's been nearly 900 hours, and Gandhi is yet to nuke me. I count myself among the lucky ones. Good luck out there."
17744,Civ
17745,IT gUUd
17746,This is possibly the best game that I have EVER played!  It is the metric by which I judge all others.
17747,"Difficult to learn, but fun once you've figured it out."
17748,"It's very hard to describe a Civilization game in great detail without starting to ramble.
 If you take nothing else from this review, know that Civilization V is more inviting, fun, and engrossing than any lengthy description can truly convey."
17749,The people saying better than civ 6 are just lying lol
17750,I love this game. It is complex but still really easy to understand and I constantly play in after work when I'm sleepy. I recommend this game to everyone.
17751,Yes
17752,I've been playing this game for over 10 years. It's straightforward enough for anyone to play but interesting enough to keep even the most seasoned player enthralled for hours.
17753,"I have played over 3,000 hours.  Well worth the money."
17754,I didn't think the game was going to be fun but ended up being pretty cool
17755,"I've had this game for many years now and I can honestly say it's one of my favorite games of all time. The strategy element is almost always different and keeps you thinking about your next move. Combat is efficient and diplomacy is as well. 

As should be the case, there are some drawbacks: difficulty for a casual player becomes unfair past Prince, start bias is not always biased, and trading with CPU's can be a nightmare. 

Even with other nitpicky complaints such as road building automation and default civilian management, Civ 5 is an everlasting game and I've stuck with it past Civ 6 and will continue to play when Civ 7 comes out."
17756,"GOOD GAME
"
17757,Well balanced game with impressive visuals and music.
17758,I actually made friends with Gandhi and it was fine. Once.
17759,Civ 4 and 5 are the best in series.
17760,Hey does anyone happen to know why my world builder is covering the amount of resources with the word resources and how i can fix it because i legit cant edit the number if its like that under the edit plot tab?
17761,One of the best civilization-building game.
17762,I can build a pizza oven before ive even finished a Civ V match
17763,Just one more turn
17764,❶ ❷ ❸ ❹ ❺
17765,"It's simply the most engaging waste of time.

Thanks to the modding community it is even more"
17766,amazing game alone and even better for destroying friendships and strengthening relationship
17767,yea
17768,"love this game
"
17769,"Game is just honestly a fun time killer if you are going through a game drought phase where you cant find anything to play.  I really love how the AI can be really  aggressive (Cough ZULU) and at the same time just be dumb as heck lmao. While the DLCS are nice they are not at all needed as well yes they are strong the base civs can be just as strong and game swinging. 

I would like to thank the Yogscast For being the only reason I play civ and come back to the game simply because they show how much fun it can be to do multiplayer or just play against AI and chill and have fun while you Nuke Venice.

The Mods on top of all of this also make the game a really fun time. ( I personally don't play with any) However I ave seen what mods people have made via youtube and friends and seen how you can rework a whole civ from being trash to being one of the top tier civs. One of the favorites I have seen is the one that makes it so Venice can actually annex the city states it takes making the civ playable.

My final thoughts about this game is this 

I wasted 30 bucks on civ 6 and came crawling back to this game Pog Champ"
17770,It's a classic that never gets old
17771,Nice
17772,Good
17773,"Great game, never gets old"
17774,Why would you buy this game? It's 10 years old... but yeah its really good.
17775,it gud
17776,"Downloaded...played 16 hours straight! get it!
"
17777,Recommended but only if you can't run Civ 6 on your PC.
17778,"Good fun, although on my computer gets a bit laggy late game. Good game"
17779,This game is the real description of endless playability. Whether it be online or solo play I have had a blast playing this game and it is one of my favourite games that I have owned across any platform
17780,Still as fun as ever
17781,"yes
"
17782,its tight
17783,Great game for the money.
17784,"civ 5 has become a very addicting game with the added dlc brave new world,itis much deeper with so much to do and many more options"
17785,Best strategy ever.
17786,Be careful with this one. This is one of those games where you can start playing and ten hours can go by without you even realizing it. I love it.
17787,i liked it bEcAuSuSE i lYkE GamEs and BitChes
17788,"This is one of my top games by playtime, and it was all worth it I regret nothing!

Think of it as a giant digital boardgame that each match takes like 20+ hours to complete, but thanks to computers you can save it instead of leaving all the pieces on your coffee table. Definitely get the major expansions, they add a lot of depth and layers that fill a void that was missing before.

I've had a blast in multiplayer too, it's like the pressure and satisfaction are turned to 11. I've always wanted to participate in a multiplayer tournament but it's difficult getting several people to devote THAT much time all at once.

10/10 get this for your kid and they won't do drugs or crime or bring bad dates home"
17789,good game
17790,I prefer the game play and graphics on this version then Civ 6
17791,"A fun game with limitless potential, both in standard and modded; buying all the expansion packs are recommended for optimal enjoyment. And of course, beware the Gandhi."
17792,"I am a Civilization addict. I've been playing it for many, many, many years. This is more polished, but the same game I know and love."
17793,this game will be the best for ever
17794,I dunno. I just enjoy it.
17795,"everything was great. literally everything
"
17796,"A great game to lose your sense of time in singleplayer, or have great laughs with friends in multiplayer.
CIV V is one of the greatest comfy laidback strategy games i have ever played! To this day I'd rather play CIV V than Civ 6"
17797,Sacrificed a lot of complexity for more streamlined gameplay. Maybe the best entry to the genre if you need that modern look. Civ is fun either way.
17798,"Sending a spy to a friendly player only to discover he's got a very large army hidden in his cities and they're all facing my direction...

""Now all of China knows you're here!"""
17799,is good
17800,Hard to describe this game with words. It's just so good! 10/10 would buy again
17801,whats there to say besides perfect
17802,The ultimatum of grand strategy
17803,Classic game!
17804,played many hours solid game
17805,"Great Game, Sinked hours into it"
17806,BUY IT
17807,The best civ. It's great!
17808,"Love this game. Have played for years. I've played other games, but always come back to this one, or whatever the latest version is."
17809,"gooc
"
17810,"Civilization V is, possibly my most liked Civilization game from a rounded perspective. Out of the previous installations I've enjoyed, its playing experience yields a lot of balance throughout the game and its expansions. It's one I keep coming back to even though VI has been released for some time."
17811,Barbarians best civ
17812,Great game
17813,Very in-depth turn based game. Exactly what I was looking for to pass time and become immersed
17814,"A very fun game however the only issues I have with it is in the DLCs. Mainly the warmonger penalty which means you can't take cities or you get a negative penalty which affects you in the long run and it seems that is does not affect the AI, i had lost two cities and they where burned down and I wanted to get some payback but can't due to the warmonger penalty it really makes me feel powerless. And the whole religion thing to me is just annoying."
17815,Fun with friends and mods
17816,"BREAKING NEWS: COVID-19 has been overcome by players of Civ V

BBC News reports from first hand witnesses; COVID-19 has been overcome by players of Civ V. Scientists have confirmed players of CIv V are either immune or have never came in contact with COVID-19. So far it has not been proven which is the answer, however the gaming community is in agreement, you cannot catch COVID-19 if you are indoors and begging for ''one more turn''. So far scientists at MIT and Oxford University have been unable to establish why Civ V beats COVID-19 but they are in agreement that it does offer some protection. Save lives, play Civ V!"
17817,Fun turn-based strategy game to play with any history buff.
17818,Crashes continually. Terrible game.
17819,it was a game
17820,It's the best in the series
17821,"I honestly still prefer the gameplay of Civ V to this day. Civ VI has its merits but even in spite of Firaxis moving on I still hold to this edition of Civilization.

I got Civ VI on Epic Games for free anyway lel"
17822,"because i can be ghandi and look anybody its worth it
"
17823,"Its Civilization, whats not to enjoy. if you havent bought it already grab the whole pack on sale. its even worth full price
"
17824,Engrossing!  Clear your calendar.

17835,decent game that keeps me playing. I like progress in games and that's what i love about this one.
17836,It's good.
17837,One of the best 4x games of all time
17838,Just another fun games to learn and grow from.  The game play was chanllenging and enjoyable.
17839,"Forget other Civs, this is the one which you should play. Great fun to play online with friends, although games can go on for days."
17840,Hi Aspyr! May you return back Mac and PC cross-platform multiplayer? Thanks and /fys/.
17841,"I found the game took a very long time and few attempts to understand but once I did, the game was very addictive and enjoyable. Somewhat tedious and a lot micromanaging is involved but if you enjoy that type of stuff then this is a game for you."
17842,Typical Sid Meier's.... brilliant as always!
17843,It's all fun and games until Gandhi get nukes
17844,It goes It goes It goes It goes It goes It goes It goes It goes  GANDHIIIIIIIIIIIIIII...nuked
17845,"This is just one of those games that's so consistent and good that I keep coming back for a few weeks or months after getting tired of whatever other games I'm playing. Are there flaws? Sure. Are they not really that big of a deal? Also yes. Some of the quirks like certain AI predictability make the game fun and let you not have a super serious game while also not having everything handed to you. Even being able to win a game on Deity (highest difficulty), I often play on 4 or 5 (kind of like medium-hardish) and just have a blast. Also, playing hotseat with friends or my significant other while on long trips is quite fun.

Recently got the Brave New World Expansion, having had Gods & Kings for....years... and I must say, it definitely breathes even more life into the game. You definitely get more of a taste of what they rolled into Civ 6, but still Civ 5-y. I enjoy it. Excellent game. Plus it's Mac compatible and doesn't just run in a Wine shell. I like it."
17846,"best civ game by far. has the charm of civs two and 3 with a mature art style and amazing score. On top of this, the incredibly complicated socio economic systems that form are always so delightfully challenging but entirely within reach."
17847,A game that holds up despite it's age.
17848,Vey interesting!
17849,Good game
17850,"I used to say Catan was like Civ. Now I say Civ is like Catan.
Purists say Civ 4 is best, and I can't blame them, but this is the best civ to enter the series at. It looks the best, makes combat the most interesting, and actually makes intuitive sense unlike all four versions that came before.
Screw civ 6, baby."
17851,"Uh, kinda cool? Idk bro lmao"
17852,it is fun
17853,good game
17854,It's too good. I can't recommend because it's beautifully engineered to get me engrossed in the spectacle. There's more to life than video games.

17856,"This nightmare crushed and ground my soul.  Even thought i only have 100 hours, this game has made me like a crack addict. If I enter this game my spirit becomes captured. I cant leave this shit. This is a cry for help. I've spend days of my life in this world while my real one was decaying in front of me. I lost everything.

Anyway, cool game"
17857,"Strategy at its best, always loved the Civ series, apart from VI that was too cartoony for my liking, V got the balance right in every way ive played well over 700 hours on this game and id recommend it to anyone."
17858,There goes my free time
17859,"This is the game that I learnt many things about civilizations. [u]How?[/u] I [b]researched[/b] about civilization (I noted at least 3 page about every civilization that I researched) that I want to play before playing it. I [b]listened to audio-books[/b] about the history of civilization that I want play. I [b]listened to traditional musics of civilization[/b] that I want to play and; We [b]role-played our civilizations[/b] whenever time we wanted to play online.

[h1] Also, here the list of my favourite civilizations: [/h1]

[olist]
[*]Roman (My favorite civilization of all time)
[*]Mongolian (Sain bainа uu!)
[*]Ottoman (Make sure your civilization is ally with Suleiman or; he can eat you anytime)
[*]Aztec (Don't let 'em to open rage mode)
[*]Hunnic (Be careful about God's Whip)
[*]French (If you killed their soldiers, don't forget to execute their farmers too or; they will reunite & capture your civilization)
[*]Byzantine (Oh Theodore, let me introduce myself)
[/olist]"
17860,I'm Sean Prime and I approve of this game!
17861,"Turn based, each game session different,  and as challenging as you might want."
17862,fun
17863,Civilisation 5 is an amazing strategy game that you'll never be able to stop playing.
17864,"This game is a fantastic game with the DLCs and a decent one without them. The game is a lot of fun, but it can take a long time to finish a single game (approximately 4-8 hours for quick and standard). It is also a lot of fun to play online with your friends if they have this game as well. However, online play is painful if you try to play with randos as they will always quit the game 50 to 100 turns into the game. I would also say that this game will provide you with at least 200 hours of singleplayer fun and excitement, and after that you will then feel the need for more of a challenge as the AIs become quite predictable even on deity difficulty. I would also suggest you check out Civ 6 as it is also a fairly good game. I personally prefer Civ V, but I know many people who actually prefer Civ 6."
17865,"good to play with if you have a friend or bf/gf. pretty much like Risk back in the day but better on the pc and impossible to ruin because its not being ""saved"" on the table for a week and a half. worth the buy for sure."
17866,"GOOD, I LIKE VERY MUCH."
17867,"First they ignore you,

17868,"Whenever I start the game with a intention to chill out in the evening it ends up me sitting for 5 hours with my mind locked on world domination, with small breaks to replenish resources from the kitchen and quick stretching... the game has ""next turn"" syndrome - highly addictive and crazy engaging!"
17869,Excelent gane to play with friends!
17870,
17871,I loved all Sid Meiers Civ game .........this one does not disappoint
17872,Best Civ game they made!
17873,Love it
17874,Amazing Game
17875,"due to the game not supporting crossplay anymore, I cannot play with my boyfriend anymore."
17876,Played a hotseat game with friends where we passed the computer. Played for 2 days straight and only got 120 turns in. Never made it to the modern era. never finished the game. Don't think i ever finished a multiplayer game.
17877,Good game
17878,good stuff
17879,The level of detail and caring thought put into the game.
17880,I play this game when i am depressed 10/10
17881,"Cant complain.
Good way to use your head and kill time"
17882,I love this game.
17883,"Played Civ since way back, many moons ago, A lot of water over the waterfall!

I have always enjoyed the game in its various xpac and upgrades.

Well recommended."
17884,"A great game, just that you can win in other ways then just war makes it so good. Bribe small countries to new world order control and domination because you are the richest motherfucker around? Hell yeah. Someone don't like it? Nuke the shit out of them. Very nice game, just takes long if you play online with friends, can take days to complete one play.

Game is 10/10 tho. Of what I read and heard Civ6 still don't add up to this masterpiece."
17885,This is pretty good.
17886,luv it
17887,it's alright
17888,I've never had evenings disappear quite so quickly as they do when playing this.
17889,It's a Civ game.  You will spend hours on just one game.  The graphics are quite good as you would expect.  The speeds and be a bit tedious after a while.  The computer probably still cheats.  Brings back memories of Civ III the last one I played.  A lot more 'stuff' in this one which seems hard to keep track of.  I enjoy the game even though it is a huge time sink.
17890,Good Game
17891,10/10 better than CIV 6
17892,"I put an outrageous amount of hours into this game. Be warned, you will be addicted."

Iroquois petitioned to block me from being able to trade with any other civilization. 

Went to war with Iroquois next turn.

Wiped Iroquois off the map.

10/10. Would dare Iroquois to block me from trading with other civilizations again."
17908,I loved that there are a wide variety of different civilizations to play as across different cultures and ethnicities. Playing it is very straightforward but it isn't too simple at the same time. Always something to do and I never get bored playing it.
17909,Great game for blowing off stress.

17915,fun game
17916,I haven't seen sun in 5 years
17917,It's a really nice game. Every CIV fan should play this CIV5!
17918,I have been following Sid meir for more than 10 years now. I love the strategy and the game mechanisms. I loved Civ III and Civ 5 is amazing. The only question in my mind is why would you remove intelligence agency it was such a realistic thing
17919,"Fun to play online with friends, or offline just by yourself. Mods make the game have so much replayability"
17920,good game. hard to not play when you have started :)
17921," This game is more addicting than most class A drugs
"
17922,"CIV V is a much improved & more enjoyable game over CIV IV. The new hexagonal tiles with the free zone control of city surroundings provides a more natural use of land. The graphics are far more pleasant, brilliant in color, texture & terrain. The Civilizations & Leaders are adequate. I would prefer some additional development. Their abilities & focus are interesting resulting in hundreds of hours of differing game strategy & tactics testing your skills @ many levels beyond ""difficulty"".
This game is a great departure from past CIV games. Government is vastly changed & is now part of 10 policies chosen when you have achieved sufficient Culture. Culture expands your borders. Population provides your Science. Since the number of cities drastically increases costs of Policy it pays to have less than or equal to 6 cities. These cities are more properly use via specialization into Science, Financial, Production & Military Outposts. It is important to also have cities dedicated to building Wonders & great persons/specialists. The long term Victory affects of this procedure are significant. The value of Great Artists, Engineers, Merchants, Scientists & Generals should not be underestimated although it is a lengthy process to obtain same. 
As always, Happiness will determine your growth. So the player must pay attention to the Happiness & Culture of their empire. The game provides unique challenges that are lots of fun for all players of any ability. Remember that you have access to city improvements & terrain improvements that aid in building your specialty cities while improving culture, population & happiness.
I believe you will enjoy this drastic change over previous CIVILIZATION games. Have fun."
17923,"Right now Civ V with DLC's is still a better choice than Civ VI in its current state, IMHO. The differences and changes between two versions are slim, but enough to give you a bad experience. A good example when something looks good on paper, but falls apart in practice."
17924,"it was fun
"
17925,Great time waster
17926,It's still one of the best games in the Civilization series.
17927,Good Strategy game with a little bit of history too! I prefer Civ 5  to Civ 6.

17935,Not the best of games but the replay is fum.
17936,based
17937,good while relaxing
17938,this game actually sucks balls and for some reason in civ 6 they replaced the barbarians with the german empire im unsure of what they meant by this but its just kind of weird
17939,"good co-op game, roads are expensive"
17940,So peace treaties are automatic and you have no say if you accept or not. Garbage game.
17941,"Seeing as I've played 1000+ hours of this game already - it's safe to say that I find this game enjoyable. I play CIv VI too - but for me, this is still the high point of Civ games."
17942,Enjoyable and more stable than Civilization VI.
17943,"This game series has entertained me for nearly 2 decades, and continues to not disappoint. This entry in the series still hasn't gotten old to me 10 years later; there's always more to explore and more ways to challenge yourself.

As a busy parent, I don't get much time to sit down and bury myself in a brainy strategy game like this. This one, though, is one of the few that make it into my limited play time. It is somehow a blend of being calm and soothing (nice after a long day of work and parenting) and intense (nice when life gets pretty routine). For anyone that enjoys strategy games of any kind and has the time to dive into this game, I'd recommend it without any reservations."
17944,"1,565 hours played...it is clearly a fun game."
17945,"Have played since 2013, @ ~1400 hrs.  Yea, buy it."
17946,Best game of advanced Risk you will ever play
17947,"I feel like this should be an educational game especially for younger crowd, but instead of building on that and improving it, they keep changing it and reducing the educational content.

for comparison here are Worlds Wonders, which educate and intrigue you more:

Civ 2: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHeyi3UbtX8

Civ 3: none

Civ 4: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1_ozty_rQZ0

My favorite Civ games were 2 and 4.  I could not really enjoy 3 and 5."
17948,My attack helicopter died to a barbarian horseman. 420/10 Hyper Realism
17949,"I like that I you don't have to build tons and tons of military units like in civ 4. Also I prefer the policy adoptions which give you better bonuses, the resources like coal and oil are limited so it makes the game harder and fairer at the same time."
17950,lit
17951,"Was a great game until a few patches completely  broke down the multiplayer. It's almost mandatory to play with one of the community mods to make it playable.
Great game, lots of fun, bad ""ending"""
17952,ghandi
17953,"If you have never played Civilization before, you are going to be very excited to try it out. The game is just you building up your civilization and teaming with nearby nations but don't get comfortable, many of the nations will betray you at some point whether it be through spies rigging elections or stealing research for technology they want. You can beat the game many ways, cultural, attrition, technological, and i believe World Peace is also a win."
17954,"Everyone is angory,  Gandhi the most so"
17955,Great game.
17956,"Great strategy game. Lots of information through history, too"
17957,It's pretty good.
17958,One of my favorites in the series right next to Civ Rev.
17959,Great game! The extensions are nice too!
17960,Too much time has been spent on this.
17961,Good fun gameplay. I like the animations
17962,We love to play this game with friends
17963,dumb game wont launch
17964,Its CIV. nuff said.
17965,Fun
17966,"This game is really fun to play in groups, I wouldn't recommend it though for solo players as it can get quite boring trying to play single-players. If you got friends to play with, get it."
17967,"I grew up with this game. The effortless modding, the beautiful and ungoofy graphical art style... I don't have much to say. I love this game. I love the freedom to do whatever you want, play however you want. I can move to the next Civs in the series, as they're just a bit too restrictive in my opinion, though they do some interesting things. They also, ironically, look horrible in my opinion, despite improved graphics."
17968,Like the strategy and learning tools for history.
17969,amazing
17970,amazing:)
17971,Probably the best Turn-Based Strategy game [b] ever made [/b] with so much replayability. Only issue is the multiplayer occasionally not working.
17972,"Civ 5 still holds up to this day. While Civ 6 may improve a lot, this is still a wonderful game that I've sunk many hours into."
17973,Very fun and addicting gameplay.

17978,"I don't know if I can call myself a veteran, but I started with Civ II when I got it free from a computer magazine (so that's a long way back...) and I liked it so I went and got Civ 4 (boxed mind you). I'm sure I spent a lifetime in that game and eventually I got a free copy of Civ 5, which I eventually bought again to get the GOTY version which I still play a match at least every month to this day.

Since I started playing Civ 5 it felt like something was missing from 4, but I haven't played 4 for a long time and didn't want to cut points from this review here, so I installed to try again. Nuh it had some nice things but 5 is better in any possible way.
So I was about to write a review about 5 but then I got Civ 6 from that other store that we don't spell it's name, and I postponed the review to see what the next game is about, so I played a couple of hours and went back to 5... it just didn't cut it, the improvements are minimal and so many things changed just to for change.

So here I am, playing Civ 5 again and finally writing my review, now I'm sure it is the best game of the series so far.

The graphics are nice, a great improvement over Civ 4 and I consider them to be better than Civ 6 as well. They are not very colorful, neither dull, the are not very realistic, yet they are not childish or cartoonish either.
You can lower them enough to make the game playable in virtually anything that you can buy today with windows, I managed to play in my Athlon II x2 250, 6GB DDR3 ram and nvidia geforce 710. Not very nice experience in late game but turning on the 2D view greatly improve things in advancing turns, and then return to 3d to play yours.
In my main system that is not great, not terrible I managed to play it at full graphics without a hic (i5 3570, 8GB RAM, Radeon 7850 1GB), I want to test it too in my newer system with the Ryzen 2600, I heard it can greatly benefit in late game from a great CPU.

The sound is great, the music is at what you could expect from Civ. There is only one thing that I miss from Civ 4, and this is the voice acting from the units that where in the language of the civilization you choose. Also Theodora's Greeks are nonsense... pretty stupid for a game of that budget to fail something like that. I don't know if other leaders have the same issue.

The gameplay is greatly improved, I do believe the placement of the UI in general make better sense and it is way more clear and informant than it was with Civ 4 and 6. You can access information about other leaders, city states etc very easy without stopping the game itself, so you can let the turns advance and you can check out the cultural conditions on it's tab.
Social policies are added in a way that make more sense than Civ 4 and works better than in 6 (I see no reason to lose older benefits just because you have new ones and can pick only a specific number to be active).

The AI is not stupid and have specific patterns that follow depending on the leader, there are surprises at first but eventually you know what to expect and who is the backstabbing one. Warmorgering is not working very well, there should be a smaller on no penalty if I wasn't the one to start the war for capturing a city. But overall it does the job and you get rid of penalties for liberating cities. I loved also that I can bring a civilization back in the game by liberating their captured city (if they eventually lost all their cities).

Espionage and Religion is not as big deal as it is in 4 and it takes a second seat. And culture city flipping is not as easy anymore, as it is way more complicated now.

What is the best part that made me never set my eyes on Civ 4 again, is the combat.
No longer an insane stack of units are attacking your city and exterminate you like rats. 1 tile, 1 unit. That's it you need to have tactics now to conquer a city, you don't just rush in with everything you have and hope there are not more units in the city.
Speaking of tiles now they are hexagonical and give you a better use of the field, especially since you need to use tactic in combat.

Anyway this is getting too big, I thing so far Civ 5 is the most balanced Civ game out there. There are things that it could have, but nothing that you will miss. You advance nice and easy, it plays most like Civ 4 without huge differences and most of what is changed is for the better and not just to be changed (like what happened with the transition from 5 to 6).
I enjoy this game and I think there is no reason for anyone who like 4X games not to like Civ 5 too."
17979,gam goodd
17980,300 hours and I'm still having a blast with mods although plating without them is still really fun
17981,i lose a bit of my soul every time i play please help! my pain aaaaaaaaahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh!
17982,Masterpiece.
17983,"I've been hooked since Civilization I and this one is probably the best of the series.  It's almost identical to the first Civ game, just with improved graphics and game play. A must have!"
17984,its ok i guess
17985,10/10 better than 6
17986,I play as America every time because I am a true American
17987,better than civ 6 but not better than civ 3
17988,"Best Civiliztion I have played by now. Pretty modern good visuals, nice music, not too complicated, user-friendly and minimum bugs. 
Still good old civilization."
17989,It's Sid Meier's Civilization- what more is there to add? The assortment of mods makes it even better!
17990,"An engaging game, with a great many features to play with, and a robust adviser system which helps you become accustomed to these features and find your feet. Diplomacy offers lots of options, and there are many different ways to win the game, which keeps gameplay interesting and allows you to adopt different playing styles to achieve the different victory types. Would recommend!"
17991,Love the game.
17992,"One of the greatest games to ever play with friends, best civ game in the series by miles, if you have friends who play games, buy this and play with them."
17993,This game is as fun on the 1000th play thru as it was on the 1st play thru.....
17994,"It's far more simplified than it's predecessor but with the DLC and steam workshop compatibility, the game is sick.
Note however, CIV 4 will be cheaper on sale, if you can tolerate the slightly (not too much) dated graphics and want a more detailed game you may want 4 instead of 5"
17995,It's ok
17996,Arguably the best Civ game ever made!

17998,Classic Civ Game that builds off the originals to make a great game.
17999,yeah its a good game
18000,The one and only <3
18001,"I played the vanilla game off of Steam for 2000+ hours before I bought BNW on my Steam account, so I have a total of 5000+ hours in this game. 

If you like something really intricate, genuinely hard on the highest difficulty settings, and endlessly replayable, and have enough spare time to actually play it, I don't think you can find a better game."
18002,I love this game a ton. It can suck you in for hours upon hours. I love you can even play user created countries. I do play on easy currently since I am not use to the different game play styles with the different countries. I would use the community tab to find game guides :)
18003,"This is one of my favourite games; even as an older game in the series, Civilization V shines as the star. Its graphics style and gameplay are superior to Civ VI in almost every way.
It merges the best elements of board games with the capabilities of interactive software to provide a truly unmatched strategy game experience.
Best played with a mix of friends and AI players.
There are so many different ways to play, and you are constantly learning how to improve your data-processing abilities."
18004,"SOOO much better than Civ VI, this is a game that i always keep coming back to.

You can literally be a power hungry, nuclear war waging gandhi and that should alone be the selling point."
18005,Best Civ has to offer.
18006,It is challenging and requires strategy
18007,"This game is a real masterpiece.  The balance is almost perfect and no matter how much you play, each game is pretty much a unique experience, even in single player. The developers managed to create a superb marriage of luck and skill that can be frustrating at times, but it never feels like you're not having fun (even when every other civ in the game declares war on you), which is a problem for many games. The hardest tiers are crazy difficult and consistently present a challenge. Just an all around fantastic game."
18008,A bloody great game ton of fun and great for muliplayer!
18009,"very epic

18021,"Broken game.  Worker stop building things they are told to build, I'm not sure what causes this, it doesn't happen all the time, but it happens enough to be pretty darned annoying.  Firaxis should fix this game, I understand from looking about this issue about the workers having to be repeatedly told to build the same thing every turn has been fixed in paid DLC, but you shouldn't have to pay for DLC you don't want to fix a broken game.  Firaxis, fix your game.

Below it's asking if I'd recommend this game, when it's working properly it is a good game, but it's broken, so I can't recommend it, if Firaxis fixed thes issues in the base game I would highly recommend it.

Additional issues, in the late game often the Policy notification will keep telling you every turn to pick a new Policy, and whenever you have to chose a new Policy category because all of your desired Policies are filled, then you have to switch Policy categories and whenever you do that it puts your civilization into anarchy which decreases production and fighting efficiency, when you have all of the Policies filled then you end up jumping back and forth between policies you're already filled and that keep your civilization in a state of perpetual anarchy."
18022,​
18023,"Barely working multiplayer, can't play the game without DLC or you will get bored in hours, the ai rather than being smarter as difficulty is changed they just get more free shit than you.

18030,"Timeless masterpiece :) Sid Meier almost turned this series into an RTS game, but turning it into this turn-based game made it more strategic in its own genre. It's unique to other strategy games with its mechanic of evolving through technology and ways of winning. The game presents you with numerous choices and points to strategize and think about on each move. It's quite challenging, and really forces you to THINK ! and for a long period of time! Like the game always says, will you build a civilization that will stand the test of TIME ? Be sure to be in a comfortable state before starting up a new game! It will really test your endurance :)"
18031,Classic strategy game.   A must play at least once.
18032,rad
18033,The quotes for new tech and built wonders adds so much to this game
18034,"Supposedly far better than Civ VI, but I never fully understood why (though, to be fair, I have no DLCs). Definitely worth buying on sale."
18035,I'm no pro a Civilization but I've been playing one version or another off and on over the last 15 years starting with II. It's an amazing game that can be played casually or super technical and still enjoyed. I have not upgraded past V so can't say much about the others but for as infrequent as I play it scratches the itch.
18036,"This is not a game without problems, but I think it's worth playing anyway. It's best to play short and/or small games because even with a boatload of CPU and more RAM than can possibly matter, it still often slows down in the endgame. It's still entertaining, but then I still play CIv 2 and Alpha C."

18042,"One of my favorite game ever.
It has rough mechanics and unforgiven situations you can put yourself in if you're not careful, and that's what makes it such a special strategy game. You'll have to learn to progress. When you solve a military or diplomatic issue, you get that satisfactory feeling that makes you feel like You are the great leader of the game.
I'd even make a case for the game being better than his big brother CIV 6, even if I strongly recommend both.
Civ 5 is definitly the funniest Civ game for diplomacy, since you can actively decide to tackle others through economic sanctions and such."

18048,A great game to play it repeatly for thousand hours at least. Some bugs are yet to fix by 2K.
18049,very much good
18050,It's my goal for 2020 to get Shane laided
18051,"This franchise has taught me more about world history than public school did.
This game may or may not be as good at that as the others in the series (I have seen decent opinions both ways) but it still does the job.

More importantly, it is fun to play."
18052,fun game
18053,The best Civ game
18054,Bom
18055,Good if you hate Europe
18056,"Badda bing badda boom, you don't like my civ? I don't like your cities. Now gimme your gold boi."
18057,Better than civ 6...
18058,A classic - a great mix of a board game and a video game.  Good for enjoying with music or with full focus.  Historically entertaining!
18059,Lots of fun. A very cerebral game that can be played alone or with friends for much enjoyment. Takes a while to pick up but is hard to put down.
18060,Challenging
18061,Good Game. Many funs
18062,Good replay value. New grid system requires more strategy for combat.
18063,Amazing game. Best civ game by far. I have played over 700 hours of this game and have thoroughly enjoyed every second of it.
18064,"it gud

i lik"
18065,"One of the most fun games I've ever played. I only enjoyed multiplayer though, 1v1 is great fun."
18066,really fun game with great music.
18067,"I don't like strategy games, and I've tried. Old school Warcraft? Nah. Starcraft? Not for me. Command and Conquer? Ehhh. But then Steam put Civ V on sale for like $12, and I bought it on a whim. Then weeks flew by as I kept telling myself ""One more turn."" 

This game is amazing, but only buy it if you're willing to lose yourself in it. Because you will."
18068,Super easy to get lost in for hours!
18069,"No matter if you're a seasoned gamer or just check Steam casually: this game will get you hooked in no time. It takes a long time to master it, but it is rather easy and the quick to learn the basics, and the best thing for inexperienced gamers is that the tutorial game itself is already a lot of fun. Don't shy away from the outrageous popularity: this beautifully made game can entertain anybody!"
18070,Good
18071,"Civilization V wins no awards for mechanical brilliance or complexity. Paradox wins there. The focus is instead on accessibility.

While in other Grand Strategy games, it can take hundreds of hours to learn the game (EU4). Civ V is quick to pick up. And this door’s always open approach transfers well into multiplayer. It’s never been this easy to feel like a world leader. I personally like renaming my cities to spite my opponents or conspiring against the top player.

That's not to say the single player isn't fun as well. Building up an empire is enjoyable and almost therapeutic. Invasions suck. The biggest shortcoming is diplomacy with AI being at best mercurial and at worst outright random.

In conclusion, Civ 5 is unique in the Grand Strategy genre, and gets my full recommendation."
18072,yes
18073,it is fun
18074,Alexander can suck my ass
18075,"If your British, its in your blood."
18076,It is good.
18077,This is my favourite strategy game of all time. It is easy to learn but a challenge to master. It rewards strategic thinking over just B-lining for a specific exploit. This is a well balanced and well polished game.
18078,venice
18079,This thing is addictive like crack. One more turn / 10
18080,Too many achievements. Life isn't long enough.
18081,ye its good
18082,Super fun game. AI is kinda dumb but you can sink hours of time into this game. The different victory conditions also feel varied and nuanced enough that the game has insane replay value.
18083,I ejoyed Civ3 and this is even better. Looking forward to Civ6
18084,"still is a fairly good game, altho now u cant find stranger to play multiplayer with"
18085,Alexander the Greatest.
18086,Still holds up today.
18087,12 times better than counting ants on the ceiling - recommended
18088,"In my opinion, Civ 5 has become the new classic Sid Meier's Civilization game. Although older and in some ways less fancy or pretty than the latest (Civ 6), Civ 5 is still an unrivaled game in some respects (assuming you have the full expansion content up through BNW, including all the added civs).

Maybe it's some kind of nostalgia bias on my part (I started on Civ 3 w/ Conquest expansion many years ago), but there's just something about the combination of broad level strategy and efficiency maximizing micro-decisions that plays out in a very compelling fashion.

Also, the modding scene is quite good, lots of balance tweaks, new civs, new wonders, quality of life fixes, etc. to spice up the gameplay quality. And that's not even counting mods that overhaul the entire game like Vox Popula (which is very popular indeed).

The main downside to the game (again, assuming BNW and using some mods, at least after your first couple/few games) is how time consuming it is. It will probably take 10+ hours (across multiple gameplay/save sessions) to complete a single game, and if you want to play many games to try various civilizations, maps and victory conditions, as well as perhaps some of the mods that alter the overall game more dramatically, that really adds up.

Overall, I'd give the game very high marks on fun and replayability, fairly high marks on graphics/UI/""aesthetics"", and moderate marks on accessability/practicality.

As a final note, if you don't want to risk getting temporarily addicted to a game that consumes much of your time/thought, don't play Civ 5. ;P"
18089,The fact that this game is turning 10 years old and yet its still comparable to civ 6
18090,"I have abandoned my family and friends over this game, and now it's all I have."
18091,It is good.
18092,Highly replayable. Unfortunately cross-platform multiplayer is killed
18093,It's a very slow paced game and yet manages to hold your attention. Extremely fun to play with friends well also giving a great solo experience as well. Cannot recommend enough!
18094,Yes
18095,It good games
18096,"It is the best Civilization game ever.
"
18097,My go-to game
18098,good game
18099,good gam yes very nice
18100,it is fun
18101,this game is amasing
18102,"I like the building, race to achievements, fighting and squashing my enemies!"
18103,It's a classic
18104,Great game !
18105,"I've loved this game, and this series, for years. a great way to kill time and something I always find myself coming back to."
18106,Good game
18107,"Civilization is a classic, and any strategy gamer will love it"
18108,i would highly recommend i have a couple hours on record but i like it a ton
18109,"I have enjoyed this game since I first bought it, and now over 200 hours in nothing has changed.
"
18110,Best civ game
18111,Awsome game
18112,This game is better than Civ 6. Get this game save money and enjoy.
18113,Is gud
18114,A ride that you can use as an in-between chore wheel as it is turn based. It's the best thing since Age of Mythology and for me that is saying something. Brilliant strategy game. I just wish there were a bit more specific-to-that-civilization late game units and a bit more custom buildings. That and I want a bit more mystique in the game design like the show Cosmos. Outside of that it is excellent
18115,"this game genuinely has some sort of magical property that makes time speed up. I could be playing this for 3 hours straight, no breaks, nothing, and it literally feels like 30 minutes has passed. That being said, it's a great game to kill time whenever time needs to be murdered!"
18116,The worker automation glitch makes this game unplayable.
18117,I used to play the first Civilization back in the '90s so it was with reluctance that I was convinced by my teenagers sons to join them in this new version. It is still very good fun.
18118,This game is dangerous.  I get lost in it and lose track of time.  Next thing I know I've lost a whole day.
18119,"The original, flawed launch was good, but if you grab all the DLC for this game, it is easily one of the better entries in the series. There's a reason its popularity rivals that of Civ II."
18120,"I like this game a lot, so I played it a lot"
18121,"Truly the greatist civilization game ever made in my opinion. I was sorely disappointed in civilization VI's ugly cartoony graphics, they were a major downgrade and i'm still enjoying this game in 2020. The graphics of this game are much more serious. The gameplay is better too and much easier to just jump in and start playing."
18122,I've been playing this for years.
18123,good game
18124,Fun until you try multiplayer. You'd think after 10 years on the market it would work but no
18125,"Addictive, time warps when I play this game."
18126,yeah
18127,"it fun

"
18128,"Plays as Germany
Wants strong Military and Economy
Gets to use ideology, chooses Autocracy
Only reads the discriptions of each level of Autocracy
Realizes I chose Nationalism and State Police
I made Nazi Germany

10/10 would play again"
18129,Yes
18130,"great game to kill time
"
18131,Only game I've even come close to 1000hrs in. Through the years I always return back to this game. One of the best strategy games ever made.
18132,This game is for you.
18133,Better than Civ 6
18134,Good
18135,My personal favorite game of all time. 500 hours of my life well spent!
18136,Good game
18137,Excellent immersive strategy game.
18138,"Could use a few mods like military engineer or disabling the automatic run through. 
Also diplomacy between other nations leaders could be improved on such as non aggression pacts (it's annoying when I am friends with Napoleon and he suddenly decides to attack me).
Overall awesome game, very replayable."
18139,cool game
18140,"Would highly recommend Civ 5. At this point, Civ 6 is out there and I'm sure it's wonderful. Coming from someone who hasn't seen Civ 6, I would have been challenged to come up with improvements to the Civ 5 (at least the state it was in after Brave New World came out). It's easily one of my favorite games of all time, and it is almost certainly the most completely enveloping game I've ever played. For better or worse, you can easily sink 5+ hours into this game at a time and leave wanting more. Will rank highly in my list of favorite games for years to come"
18141,good but get the newest one
18142,one of the best games I've ever played fun with friends and on your own
18143,"The best turn based strategy game there is.
"
18144,I enjoyed the easy flow of the game
18145,King of strategy games
18146,"good graphics, nearly endless variety and re-playability"
18147,Very Entertaining Adictive
18148,"Really enjoyable game even after replaying it for a while that has a lot of meaning behind strategy can win you wars.
It does take a while to finish which is its only downside.
I can also recommend once you do get bored of normal gameplay to use mods to futher enhance the original gameplay to more enjoyment over time!"
18149,Yeah its pretty good
18150,"its a really fun game,it does get pretty boring after a while so...yeah"
18151,One of my best friends introduced me to this game back in 2013. It is by far on of my favorite turn based strategy games. I highly recommend this game to anyone and everyone.
18152,game crashes instantly do NOT buy is very BAD game play FORTNITE instead
18153,Best TBS game ever.
18154,This game make my pp hard
18155,It is fiRE
18156,is good
18157,"nice game 
"
18158,"Good game. Sit back, Grab a beer, play for like 10 hours. Good time"
18159,"Great fun, easy to sink hours at a time into"
18160,it is a fun game for if you want to pass time
18161,"If you have any type of responsibility at all, I urge you not to play this game. This game will consume weeks of your life..."
18162,"Crashes, after 2K messed with it"
18163,"it crashes to much
"
18164,"Fun at your own pace with the emergence into the history of the nation you select. A great game to introduce to your kids from 12 and up. Workshop mods enhance game play and develop players tactical skill. 
"
18165,"good game, runs well


napoleon is a doof"
18166,Still much better than Civ 6!
18167,hggf
18168,It's a very fun game to play with strategy and diplomacy while building your country.
18169,pretty good
18170,"In terms of strategic games, this one is probably my favourite. It is complicated yet not overcomplicated and still accessible. The game provides 4 different victory types (science, culture, diplomacy, and domination) and you can play as many different countries and leaders. There are also different map types and sizes and you can choose your own difficult setting. You can play alone against AI or with friends (both co-op as well as PvP). 

A highly fun experience no matter which settings you choose."
18171,"Incredible game. Honestly, I'm quite late to the party in writing a review for this game, so I can't imagine I can say much more than what has already been said, but ultimately I would recommend this game to anyone as it truly is one of the best games I've played, and is one of the best renditions of the Civilization series and of the 4k genre as a whole."
18172,t
18173,f
18174,its cool but not the best but still cool
18175,"I played this game for years now, and it is probably the best civilization they made. The policies are great, all your decisions are important and the game is somewhat decently balanced.
The only bad part can be the AI that makes some questionable decisions, but other than that, each new game is a different experience, would recommend to all who love turn based strategies."
18176,"Still the best and worth it to buy. Makes sure to wait for a sale, i.e. summer sale, to get the best out of your buck. This is is old, but it aged so well and the playability is enhanced if you have other friends to play with."
18177,"great game, lekmod very fun too"
18178,V V Good Value. Many Replay.
18179,If you voluntarily put more than a thousand hours into anything you either like it or you're a psycho.
18180,"This game is a beastly time-suck, and quite possibly the very best in the entire series!"
18181,better than civ 6
18182,a relaxing game to destroy friendships with
18183,"A great game. I started with Civ IV and while I did not love the changes at first, I enjoy them now. I think this is better than Civ VI. Much better art style."
18184,"after over 100 hours I can't say I even figured out how to play it right because i'm a dummy. Remains the best timewaster I've played despite that. Hours just melt away, making it useful for when your waiting or need to take your mind off stuff."
18185,very good
18186,.
18187,sound
18188,10 years later and still great
18189,Super addictive
18190,awesome
18191,its a pretty okay game
18192,good game bruh good with friends
18193,"Biggest problem with this game is how unbalanced Civs are relative to each other. Otherwise, a candidiate for the greatest game of all time, in my opinion"
18194,"This game has a good level of complexity as well easy controls, the difficulty level setting allows you to grow with the game and get used to the different strategies. This game is well worth the effort and does allow for multiplayer mode but that is not as complete as the rest of the game."
18195,Epic & awesome!
18196,better than Civ 6 and one of the best turn-based strategy games ever made
18197,"It is a fantastic game, including a great variety of wonders, advanced maps, graphics, and music. The game allows you to play very strategically, with clear advantages if you play Egypt (wonders), or Germany (productivity) to mention two examples. Artificial intelligence is very good, although allies sometimes don't react to battles from my experience. All things considered, a very complete game. The hexagonal map points are a definite plus."
18198,nice
18199,"Just one. More. Turn. I can't ever find myself being able to stop playing this game. If you don't mind your entire life being sucked away by a video game, this is the one to play!"
18200,Very kek. Many sleepless nights.
18201,Not as complex as Civilization 6.  Best version since Civ 2.
18202,classic game.
18203,Good stuff
18204,pretty good
18205,One of the best games ever made.  Periodt.
18206,I would recomend this game to other players
18207,Great game
18208,Very well balanced strategy game.
18209,"Initially started playing because a friend talked me into it. Now it's one of my most played games on steam. 
I'd say it's a fairly decent entry point to the genera, that is, if you have a friend who wants to play with you it'll be all the more fun.

I only have a couple complaints, most can be solved. By default if you're playing multiplayer without the option 'pit boss' enabled if you get disconnected an AI will take your turn - not fun. And because it's an old game the turn timers aren't that fantastic because the netcode isn't great. 

Overall though I'd recommend it to anyone even remotely interested."
18210,"Fun alone and even more fun with friends. Wanna take over the world, or do you want to sit back and watch the world burn... Well now's your chance to create your own nations history!"
18211,I mean duh.
18212,thoroughly enjoyable even as someone who only played singleplayer
18213,its pretty good i guess
18214,good stratagy building game'
18215,Nothing like a little warmongering in the morning
18216,very fun
18217,"Conquered the world as the Poles over 20 times, in sheer defiance. 10 outta 10, would drown the world in kielbasa and pierogi in a moment's notice again."
18218,hecker of a game
18219,morocco wishes for a map thats all desert and rivers. 100/10 would build kasbahs on every tile again
18220,"My favorite turn-based strategy game ever. Good difficulty progression, rewards playing with a better understanding of the game without getting boring and too predictable, especially at high difficulty. Multiplayer is also really fun, especially when long games end up with total war."
18221,Great game
18222,best turn based strategy game ever
18223,hihistory!
18224,From playing 6 to this I would definitely recommend this!
18225,"This game is good, especially with all the DLC."
18226,"Excellent game, No 1. by far and away on my Steam account. Game is excellent to play on your own or with friends, if a little buggy multiplayer"
18227,"Brilliant game, such fun!"
18228,very nice
18229,The best of the civ games i have played!
18230,pretty gamer
18231,Very fun to play with friends.
18232,fire
18233,very good and very fun strategy game.
18234,This game is Amazing!
18235,Great game
18236,i like
18237,.
18238,One of my favorite games of all time but I will only play with you if you have the DLC.
18239,"Spent way too many hours on this, great game.  Annoying bug crashes when Im trying to liberate a capital."
18240,"still the best, did not like VI, graphics and gameplay more like a kids game"
18241,"Fun game, fun and easy on the eyes."
18242,Awesome
18243,Hi don't get this game it never works and you'll just get killed by some scumfuck idiot fuckface who hacked the game this is an official report he is called GoddamnBatman and he is a bitch. 4/5

18249,ggoooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooodddd
18250,all of it
18251,"its alright, I swore it had remote play but I can't seem to find it....."
18252,"If you want your monkey mind constantly engaged while listening to podcasts, this is the game.  I like how they switched to hex patterns which changes the strategies you use when attacking other cities to make it more of a brain game.  I don't like change generally, so this game will last the test of time, in my opinion and as my 2307 hours of game play will attest."
18253,nice :D
18254,"Love this game! So many different strategies you can use, and so many different countries to play as, each with their own unique bonuses. Highly recommended, both for solo and and with friends!"
18255,"This has been a  great game, over the years.  It never plays same way or path to win or loss."
18256,i like it !!
18257,"I enjoy basic to intermediate strategy games. For me they need an element of realism but not so much that they become really boring to play. The civ games do just that. I have thoroughly enjoyed playing Civ5, you can literally sink 6 hours without realising it. 

The only complaints I have are mostly fixed by mods, such as not having a mode where units are smaller to show how vast my armies are and sometimes the AI players make ridiculous decisions. 

8/10 For me."
18258,"Pretty good, only wish civ 6 would work on my computer"
18259,"Better than Civ 6, Do not waste ur $ on civ 6, units cost too much to maintain, U have to conquer a city twice to capture it, workers only can be used 3 times, it is boring."
18260,Good fun game when it doesn't crash
18261,good
18262,great game ever.
18263,Fun
18264,its cool and addictive so be careful
18265,very addictive
18266,"Elegant and clear, a masterpiece."
18267,"Beware, time is pass faster than you think"
18268,1 settlement. 12 citizens. build another. rinse. repeat
18269,its ok
18270,can swallow you whole
18271,Very fun and thrilling. Incredibly complex but a good amount where it isn't overwhelming or confusing.
18272,"Civilization V wasn't a revolution. It was an evolution. Civilization IV has faded fromt my memory, I wouldn't even know how to start a game. Civilization VI eclipses this version, but is a complete pain in the ass with ridiculous hardware restrictions, and won't even run on vintage hardware. I like this version for it's replayability and how it runs on pretty much any computer that still has a pulse. Best version of Civilization full stop."
18273,really good wow
18274,150 hours went by very fast once I learned how to automate skip turn
18275,great game
18276,Love the Mods
18277,good game
18278,"enjoyable game, spent lots of hours strategizing and always knew what my actions where build within reason. also if your sadistic war crimes are posible by starving capital citys."
18279,good
18280,.
18281,Not a bad game.

18300,This is it boys and girls. In my humble opinion the absolute peak of the Civilization franchise. It is simply a masterpiece.
18301,good game :)

"
18306,amazing game
18307,Me and all my friends enjoy playing this game together i would recommend that you get the dlc wait for it to go on sale and i promise it will be worth the money.
18308,Better than Civ 6.
18309,"Decent multiplayer, varied customization, and accessibility support; if you enjoy turn- based strategy, this would be a good investment."
18310,"great game, i keep wanting to play"
18311,"Better than Civ 6. 
Don't believe the rumors - they still have not patched Ghandi's relentless aggression after all these years and he WILL NUKE YOU in the atomic age. It's a shame cause it's a bad game for this only reason since he is in every bot game pretty much, -3 points out of 10 for this. 
9 out of 10 I recommend it."
18312,nice
18313,This is by far the best PC game I have ever played. IT's worth endless hours of play time for any casual gamer.
18314,"Ive never consistantly loved a game for so long of my life 
"
18315,It's a fun turn-based game. Winning is a little fuzzy but still fun.
18316,"Overall a great game. Great gameplay, and progression is actually fun."
18317,civ5 is fantastic! get it on sale with all the dlc
18318,one of the better games iv played
18319,This is addictive with insane replayability. Even better with friends. Beware. Just... one more... turn...
18320,"This is honestly the best game ive played in my life, over 1800 hours , and i still struggle on its hardest diffiuclty which normally after playing any game that long it becomes easy. this uses real world conepts perfectly, like units in hills recieving a defensive bonus, and even spawn points for different types of civs matches up to their real world kind of culture (like coastline, or forest for the native americans. It challenges your mind, and bring hours and hours of fun. totally 100% worth the price, buy the expansion packs too as babylon is amazing!"
18321,y e e t
18322,Redditoomento
18323,Love this game! Thats all
18324,"Good strategy game, although it can be very long."
18325,"This was always my favorite game.  I've play Civilization since it started, and have enjoyed every upgrade. Some upgrades I welcomed and some I had to get because my computer crapped out and I had to get a faster computer which meant my Civ game would no longer play.  My favorite Civ game was Civ II.  I played it for years   When Civ 4 came out I was fascinated by the graphics.  Each version since has been more fascinating.  Civ 6 is amazing but a lot more complicated.  I have both Civ 5 and Civ 6 on my computer and I switch off between them.  Both are great in their own way.  By the way I am 73 years old and I have always loved empire building games."
18326,Not CIV 6
18327,Addictive - be careful lol
18328,"Been a fan of CIV since CIV 1 .... challenging, strategic, historical.  Everything a game should be"
18329,I love this game. Just wish that they had a Canadian Empire.
18330,This is the best game of this type that I've ever played!
18331,Wakanda Forever
18332,Just one...more...turn...
18333,fun
18334,This game is absolutely amazing. It's great turned based strategy game and both the single player and multiplayer modes are both fantastic. I would also greatly recommend this game over Civilization VI. It has more realistic graphics and less cluttered.
18335,"Great game. Bought a copy for my friend to play so we could war it out. He likes Civ 6 better though. 
So now i'm broke and alone, but at least I have Civ 5 to soothe my ails."
18336,Rule your own county. it's as fun as it sounds.
18337,this game makes friends super angry at eachother for playing the game how it is supposed to be played I like it
18338,Love how its a longer game you can get back to and play with friends.
18339,gg
18340,"A new civ game always takes some getting used to after playing the previous game in the series, but once I got used to this one, it is a good entry in the series. I didn't mind civ 4's system of having huge stacks of units in one tile, but there's something to be said for this game's attempt to add more tactics by requiring the player to maneuver units around into strategic formations instead of civ 4's more brute force combat system. I think I finally decided that I like civ 5's system better overall. I don't like the way maintenance of roads works in 5, but other than that I think everything added to civ 5 is a good addition. Religion works very differently, but is fun to manage in its own way. The ""tourism"" system in culture is a bit annoying because you must decide pretty quickly if you want to go for a culture victory, but the other changes to culture work well. Trade and trade resources work different as well, but the system works fine. Overall, I was happy with this game."
18341,"The replayability of this game is just something else. So many different civilisations to master and different ways to play. There are a few glitches, especially in multiplayer, but this is my favourite game in my library."
18342,It good
18343,600 Hours. Yeah its a pretty good game.
18344,its rlly fun

18347,"If there were ever a game that could completely destroy your weekend and your friendships, it's this game."
18348,"Beautiful play through different stages of humanity, complex but user friendly and engaging"
18349,Excellent Game
18350,The classic continues to evolve and get even better!
18351,It is a nice chill game to play a couple of hours.
18352,"Became a fascist loli Putin with an unlimited supply of nukes and giant purple horse c***s

18353,Good Game
18354,Love this game
18355,I love the mechanics of CIV 5 and the wide variety of countries available. This is one of my favorite strategy games. I do wish that the progression through new eras were slower because I love pre - industrial eras the most but that is just a personal preference.
18356,"I enjoy building civilizations. The game has many twist and levels of difficulty. It is additive.
"
18357,It's fun to play with friends
18358,ghandi is the one true god
18359,"the superior CIV game. allows for an enjoyable playthrough, great multiplayer"
18360,Do I even have to explain why this is possibly one of the greatest games? It was genre defining and ground-breaking in my opinion. It gave me so much and is still such a great game. I had a steam account when I was very young and had 800+ hours on it for this game. I had played this so much!
18361,"If I were able to mark my recommendation as neutral, which I can't, then that's what this recommendation would be, neutral. The only reason it is not completely negative is this does have some playability and replay value, but... if you own any version of Civilisations, you've pretty much owned them all. Every version I've played contains all the same bugs,, it's just each version has better graphics, very little innovation goes into this game if any, it's almost as if they're simply holding the intellectual property and the original developing team all died 10 years ago. It's another over-milked franchise"
18362,ghandi is love
18363,im still on my first match
18364,really good game to spend a few hours on.
18365,"A great strategic game, with a lot of details to gameplay."
18366,"This is probably my favorite game of all time. If you like turn based games this is the game to get! I recommend getting the community patch ""Vox Populi"" it'll enhance your game play by a lot! Vanilla BNW is good too if you're not into MODS!

Will you stand the test of time?"
18367,one of the best strategy games
18368,"One of the best game ever

18374,good game
18375,game good
18376,It's perfect.  Play it.
18377,This game is a great time and is even better with friends! I 100% recommend this to anyone who is looking for a great game for both single player and multiplayer!
18378,Very fun and captivating.
18379,i liked this game
18380,Yes
18381,just read other reviews. good game
18382,"Cool strategic game. It is similar to Rise of Nations in a way, and that was one of my favorite games. Good concept and well executed. Warning: Civilization 6 is out, so if you want the newest one, get that one, and the tutorial doesn't save so don't get too invested."
18383,"It has it's issues, the AI is dumb but it isn't terribly stupid there are plenty of ways to win but the best in single player is domination but in multiplayer any are fun besides science and time. the AI can offer some challenge but for the most part after you learn the difficulty you don't lose I'm a fan of some of the higher difficulties but I dislike the cheats instead of a more competent AI. It really isn't bad the devs haven't outpaced themselves they made a good game that works well and is easy to use I honestly prefer this game over Civ 6 even though it has some of my favorite features including the non static enviroments like flooding and tornadoes."
18384,"enjoyed the fact that no strategy and just trying to bulldose other civs is possible, but not op. Wish there was like a way to learn strats tho without needing to spend 20 hrs on a game. only played like 5 total games in my whole time."
18385,game very good
18386,youll starve to death before you get off
18387,Gandhi glitch = endless fun
18388,its aight
18389,it ok
18390,"I'm sorry but I have to dislike. It kept segfaulting for me on Linux. I'll like Civ VI instead. That one only crashed two times in 40h playtime this weekend.

The first time it worked one hour or so but then it kept crashing after 5-20mins each time and was therefore unplayable. Searching for ""Civ5XP[3051600]: segfault at 14 ip 000000000885bca7 sp 000000005c4b2090 error 4"" shows some resolutions like binding the process to only 8 cores but even binding to only one core didn't help for me. I'm playing with Ryzen 3900X and RTX 2080 Super."
18391,"Better then Civ VI, worse then Civ IV. A good game on it's own though, but a bit more streamlined and arcade, with far less mod support then IV had.

The graphics are pretty good as well, probably the best out of the civ games."
18392,"One of the best games I ever played. I am not a fan of turned base strategy games, however I can make an exception for this master piece. Sometimes I avoid playing this game, since I know time will just fly by. So ONE MORE TURN is a Risky MOVE!!!"
18393,"23 hours of civ in three days, maybe that will tell you something about the game.."
18394,"Yes play BUT you can get stuck in a ""JUST ONE MORE TURN"" hold patern.
"
18395,This game is a masterpiece. 10/10
18396,reall good game play in spair time
18397,really good game
18398,Building a civilization while competing with others or the AI as others for resources and the best areas without the bs political correctness in Civ VI
18399,Its good
18400,A fun strategy game to pass the time with
18401,My only complaint is that I don't notice the sun rising after playing all night instead of the few hours I had planned on playing.
18402,not bad
18403,Super chill even when you're getting anihilated. Flexibility of settings allows for super easy if you just want to relax completely or much more challenging with roaming barbarians and aggressive neighbours...
18404,"Really good! Some minor flaws like border expansion rate limited because of happines and in higher levels AI starts cheating especially in combat. Other than that if you play on Prince level and try out every map- and victory type, it is really nice to play. Development has been great from older ones."
18405,is good
18406,"If you like strategy, this is the game for you. It is really enjoyable... Only thing i really have a problem with, is the amount of time my PC uses to calculate moves for AI x'D But not really a game problem.. thats more a hardware problem on my end :D"
18407,Best game on steam
18408,"I sent my girlfriend nudes using this game, and she now has 2 of my kids and now we live in a house together! good game 10/10"
18409,"Fun game, slow paced tho. If you're trying to play lan, I'd recommend multiple setups and copies of the game, hot seat takes an actual lifetime to get anything done. 
"
18410,gotta love it
18411,"GOOD
"
18412,perisa go sab stabs tstba stbab i am now iwnning game
18413,"5 is Still the best. The elegant and enduring clarity of the visuals and refreshing lack of micromanagement make for a better and more fun experience than 6.

I enjoy it as domination though."
18414,I've been playing this game for years and it never gets old.
18415,good game. good time waster.
18416,e
18417,"Best Civ creation ever, I hate Civ 6, this is the best as far as game play.  Played since original came out."
18418,good game.
18419,I'd play it over and over again.
18420,"This game is incredible. You'll waste more time than you are comfortable wasting.... but god, it's good."
18421,"With my 193 hours of gameplay for this game, I would definitely recommend it! this is a huge step up from CIv IV. The world leaders actually talk and have personality now , a major gripe I had with IV. The game looks beautiful and I really like the new grid system they've implemented. It's also much easier to pick up than other titles, which earns it extra points with novices like me. I prefer playing it without the DLC expansions, I wasn't a big fan of brave new world but others will probably like it. If you've got the patience and the time, I would recommend this game , if there's any civilization in history you've always wanted to learn about or play as, there probably in this game. Let your journey through time begin!!"
18422,A banger
18423,its ok
18424,Good game not being able to stack is a problem but at least the brought back indirect fire
18425,"it was alright
"
18426,"I will never purchase another game from Fireaxis, Aspyr or 2K. I had purchased twice, once for me and again for my girlfried who plays on Mac. As of 2019 cross platform playing is disabled because the developers do not want to support their old game when Civ6 (which is trash) has been released. In addition after some research Civ6 (again, trash) isn't updated at the same rate for Mac and PC which means we also can't play on that platform. 

Here is the statement from Aspyr:
""We do our best to provide the best gameplay experience on all platforms and given the option between retiring Sid Meier’s Civilization V on Mac or updating the game to 64-bit while disabling crossplay, we opted for the latter"" - Aspyr Joe

To those who are looking for good 4K games may I suggest Endless Legend, Age of Wonders 3 (both fantasy) or Age of Wonders Planetfall (future/space). My hope is that a studio will take on the dark age - modern era 4K and Usurp the Civ franchise. They have been allowed for too long to be unchallenged and have a despicable DLC policy (Again Civ 6 is garbage)."
18427,Help's relieve stress.
18428,Ik wil kaas.
18429,I have invested years into this game on various Steam Accounts. Still love it to death.
18430,good game
18431,Its pretty good
18432,Civ 5 is one of my favorite games!  It's a replay-ability is great.  Try downloading a copy of lekmod and lekmaps to improve multiplayer gameplay.
18433,Love this version
18434,"Same as all the other civilization games.  if u like them u will like this.
"
18435,"This is a great way to spend an hour or two on your computer, then realise that ten turns have passed."
18436,It's alright.
18437,"best one so far
"
18438,not the best but very addictive game
18439,"The Civilization franchise has been with me since childhood, and first sparked my love for history. I remember playing Civilization IV when it came out, before I had Steam, and I maintain that thousands of hours were spent with that game. However, I remember the reason I got Steam in the first place was to play Civ V and track my hours played. At launch I was stunned by its beauty, but it was pretty rough in a lot of areas. Nowadays though, this is a solid and worthy successor to its previous title, and hundreds of hours have since been spent with close friends in college playing Civ V all night long. The world the game takes place in is fantastic, the hexagonal upgrade from the previous squares for land configuration, coupled with an insane leap in graphical quality makes it a realistic and believable setting, and in my opinion a perfect blank slate for history to unfold. In relation to this, the art design and direction is fantastic. The art deco UI and menus are sleek and somehow pretty neutral, like it is framing exhibits in a museum or something like that, not overpowering the feel of whatever civ you're playing. The Civs themselves are vibrant and their leaders, who speak and move and breathe, even express emotion, are a crowning achievement that really makes it feel as though you are actually dealing with other civilizations. The accurate stylistic and cultural choices made by the development team here lead me to praise the art of Civ V as the pinnacle of the Civilization franchise thus far. The sound design is classic, and perfect for the inputs that trigger them. The dings and clicks and instrumentals that play when you upgrade a unit, finish a wonder, or complete research to this day have a very particular effect in some essential part of my being. Coupled with the sounds of units when they move, of workers when they work, or the voices of historical leaders brought back to life backed by some of the most professional orchestral scores I have heard in a video game highlight the sheer volume of love and labor that girds every fiber of Civilization V. The gameplay is the absolute gold standard for 4X gaming, and while it had some serious issues at launch like the complete absence of religious mechanics, the DLC has since brought it up to scratch and then some. The learning curve is not too steep in my opinion, even for those new to the genre. I think one can get a hang of it pretty handily in a fairly short period of time. It has gotten to the point where interacting with the UI occurs at the speed of thought essentially, and that is a credit to Civ V's design, not to me. Overall, Civilization V is wonderful and a real contender for one of my favorite games of all time, for which it earns a 9.5 from me. Civilization IV sparked a love of history in my heart and a further love for strategy games in general. I know for a fact that somewhere out there right now, someone else is playing Civ V, and beginning on that very same journey. And that really puts a smile on my face.
"
18440,is good
18441,Honestly the best iteration of the Civ series.
18442,"You can't do anything wrong when buying this, if you like turn based strategy games."
18443,sux
18444,better then civ6
18445,"horrible mechanics, stripped down with limited options, too unbalanced in favor of constant wars, and no immersion; a disgrace to the series.  civ iv was the last of the real civs."
18446,I've enjoyed this game for years.
18447,Me like
18448,one more turn wont hurt
18449,gh
18450,Its really good game
18451,great game when brought in sales
18452,"Definitely the best Civilization game, sucks they nerfed all the fun out of the series in the sequel."
18453,TLDR: It's one of - if not the - best grand strategy game of all time
18454,Civ is a classic and this is the best version of Civ.
18455,"Sucks to not to be able to play with someone having Mac due to version mismatch. This has been a prolonging issue for more than a year. 
Whats the point of paying money for something that you cannot use. Robbery in daylight!"
18456,"itss fun
"
18457,This game has very relaxing gameplay that's similar to its successor.
18458,Before you play this game ask yourself how many hours do you want to spend on it.
18459,SO much better than Civ 6!
18460,Tis very fun...
18461,Posting this review at 947 hrs of playtime. Still not sure I'd recommend it. Will give it a provisional upvote for now and check back when I hit a thousand.
18462,It is the type of game were you say one more turn then an hour latter onemore turn.
18463,"is good
"
18464,
18465,"A classic, and with an app called Play Your Damn Turn, very easy to play mutliplayer asynchronously. We've been doing a 5 man game over the course of... 2 months? 24 hour timer on a turn, play it when you got time, app notifies the next player when you're done."
18466,gud
18467,All round fun ocasional quirks like crashing but thats probably due to my OS
18468,Great game
18469,fun strategy based game
18470,It's a great game
18471,it good
18472,Yes
18473,"A very good game, that kept up with CIV 6 up until it's expansions. Now CIV 6 just offers more things to do, better game systems and together with CIV 6 Environmental Skin Mod it also looks much better. Still, I have great memories about this game, so there is no reason to give it a negative review. Pick it up on sale if you want to check it out and see what is CIV 6 predecessor like. It's also a good option if you are on a budget and/or have an older PC."
18474,Fun game
18475,It's pretty cool I guess.
18476,This game is as addictive as crack.

18485,Love it
18486,"Been playing for a while but might as well leave a review a million years later.  The upvote is conditional mainly on its DLC and the excellent modding community.  Really fun with those DLC, without them the game felt pretty hollow and incomplete."
18487,Good strategy game to play with friends.
18488,Really fun!
18489,Awesome turn based strategy
18490,"First and only Civ game played. Single playthroughs can take dozens of hours and there is pretty much infinite replay ability but after a while it can get a little stale. Super fun single player and even better when you're with your friends. Fantastic sound track. Quite a lot of DLC, but each one is on average below $10, and adds an entire (or multiple) new playthroughs that you can do. Worth it if you're into it, just wait on a sale. 10/10."
18491,great game
18492,"The best iteration of the franchise so far with great community mod support. I still miss Alpha Centauri, but until Firaxis learns their lesson from After Earth and Civ 6, this'll do"
18493,fun
18494,"Sid Meier's Civilization games are some of the best strategy games I can think of. So far, I've liked Civ 5 and I've played it for 60 hours."
18495,Civ is the best turn based strategy game I have found.  I prefer Civ V or VI because of the mods and the larger maps.
18496,.
18497,Civilization is all iterations is still my favorite strategy game. I love the game mechanics and I love the variety of different civilizations that you can groom to take over the planet.
18498,very fun game

18505,"So fun! A great game, especially for people who have never played a civ game before"
18506,A complicated game requiring real attention to one's strategy to win.
18507,Fantastic addictive game. The whole franchise is excellent and utterly engrossing.
18508,i have no idea how to play this game
18509," I am a history buff and I like how playing this game let's me take on different aspects and see how they play out.

"
18510,it's good
18511,I have no clue why i enjoy these kind of games i'm a Destiny player by heart.
18512,Honestly one of the best turn based strategy games ever made and the game that sparked my interest in strategy games in general.
18513,"I like Civ 5 a lot. It brings much improved graphics over Civ 4. The policy tracks are a nice addition that allows tailoring your strategy to your civilization's strengths and game situation. The one-unit-per-tile (UPT) takes some getting used to but plays out nicely on maps with sufficient space (all but tiny maps and not too heavily mountainous terrain). Sure the combat and diplomacy AI could be better but it's all part of Civ's enjoyable madness :) I love how the game pace changes as you progress from the initial land grab and staving off (raging) barbarians over the religious wars of the mid-game to ideological polarisation of the late game (with the Brave New World expansion). Depending on your play style, a single game can take many hours and I enjoy ""getting back into gear"" upon reloading a save. Very good in multiplayer with a bunch of friends, too!"
18514,good turn based fun but no R>U>S>E>
18515,GREAT!
18516,fun
18517,very much funs
18518,"Reviewing games I played a long time ago:

I admit I prefer the Paradox real time grand strategy games, so I was never much into Civilization, but I did play the originals and Alpha Centaury quite a lot. I didn't spend a lot of time with Civ V, but I did enjoy the time I had with it and it's definitly one of the best of its kind."
18519,"Really good, atmospheric. though you might not be interested if turn-based isn't your thing. But not bad for one"
18520,Its a fun and easy to pick up but complex to master strategy game.
18521,yes
18522,"Sid Meier's Civilization V is the best turn-based strategic civilization/empire building game that I have played so far.

I haven't played very many civilization/empire building games yet, but the great thing about Sid Meier's Civilization V(aka Civ V) is that from the beginning I didn't need a lot of help figuring out the basics of the game even though I was new to the genre. That being said, if you have never played a game from this genre before, like how I hadn't, you likely still will need some help in figuring out the basics. I recommend a guide or a video tutorial if you don't have any friends to help.

So far my favorite mode in Civ V is singleplayer, as it has different difficulties that can be chosen from based on your skill and you can save a game and come back and continue it later, unlike most multiplayer sessions that I have played.

Speaking of multiplayer, I have played a decent amount of multiplayer sessions with my friends, and while you can save multiplayer games, we usually never came back to finish sessions that we started. And while I have never been particularly good at multiplayer in this game, that was more than a 1v1, I did still enjoy it sometimes.
1v1 multiplayer though is very different from a free for all with 5 or 6 friends, and I would say is actually easier than playing with 5 or 6 players.

Overall, this game is an excellent multiplayer as well as singleplayer game for those who like turn based strategy games, but I do have to warn you that you will likely be spending hours playing each session, especially in multiplayer.
So, if you don't have a lot of free time at all, games like this one may not be for you, but if you don't mind spending hours playing a civilization building game, then you will likely love this game."
18523,Gud
18524,Excellent game with plenty of time wasting factors that I will leave for you to learn.
18525,It's a fun game and it's super cheap
18526,Great game in the series.
18527,"One of my favorite games. I also have Civ VI, but enjoy this one much better."

18532,One of my favorite games on steam. It is complete with loads of mods
18533,Every game reaches a point where you need more experience points than you have to open the next level & it hangs you up right there with no way to get out of it. Haven't been able to get any help with this.
18534,"Have you ever wanted to spend hours and hours doing something completely pointless and hate it the whole time? If so, this game is for you."

18545,Fart poo
18546,Its not CIV VI
18547,"I am sorry to say but the intro for is highly annoying.  There needs to be an option to bypass the general or whatever the character bios is considered.  Instead you can opt to""include historical biographies"" which i think would actually be a neat idea for those interested In the history of various persons.

Other items that are quite annoying for game play and that is you cannot stop game cycle.  In other words the game continues going forward whether you like it or not.  Enemy comes near and ransacks your city, captures a worker, there is nothing you can do about it.  You have to sit and wait for the cycle to end to turn off auto end turn OR you can sit spinning on your thumb watching your city get destroyed because you have such limited funcionality with your city."

18558,"Great game, perfect for those who like long games that you need to think each round. It is game in which you can decide how to win, but at the same time you need to plan how to get that win and face off enemies in some cases."
18559,shit trash game
18560,better than vi
18561,very nice
18562,good strategy game. been playing this game since PS days.

18564,It's Civ 5 I don't know what more to say it's iconic
18565,yes
18566,I love everything about this game i have civ 6 and civ 5 both are incredible games and would highly recommend
18567,Excellent strategy game.  Serious classic.
18568,"(+) “One more turn” 
(-) “One more turn”"
18569,"The Civilization series is probably my most-played series ever, but thanks to Civilization V, that title is endangered, and possibly obsolete.  Civilization III won my heart; it is an empire-builder through and through, and has an excellent level of depth and balance of the civil and military side.  It also has that flow, responsible for the classic/infamous ""one more turn"" phenomenon.  There's always something to do; it's easy to lose track of the turn and not realize that the sun has risen... which means it must have also set at some point.

Civ IV initially struggled to run on my potato, back in 2005, but (with the help of a couple expansions), rose to similar heights.  Beyond the Sword is ranked 4th in playtime among my Steam games, and that's not counting my disc-based Vanilla playtime.

So I'm a fan of Civ V's predecessors.  But I have never been able to get into Civ V.  My hard drive is scattered with abandoned games of it; only one played through to completion.  I gave it another try this winter, but even with the expansions, wound up abandoning two games.  It felt more like a chore to try to like it, than that one-more-turn feeling.  But why?

I think the single biggest culprit is the one unit per tile (aka 1UPT) rule.  In previous iterations, you could have as many units as you wanted per tile.  Fifty, a hundred, no problem.  This led to ""stacks of doom"", scores of units on one tile that, even if they were individually weak, were virtually unstoppable, at least until whittled down.  You would lose cities to them, and the only good way to counter them was another stack of doom.

They sound bad written that way, but it still largely came down to who had the better army, with some element of use of terrain.  It was easy to maneouver units when they were in stacks, wars tended to come to a climax quickly (whether that meant resolving in favor of one side, or degrading into a stalemate), and the pacing of the game was not negatively effected.  Sure, turns would take longer while a war was going on, but things were happening during those longer terms.

Still, Firaxis decided the stacks of doom were a problem, perhaps due to the lack of modeling attrition; perhaps thinking it wasn't tactical enough.  What we see in Civ V is the opposite of them, in extremis.  You can only have one unit per tile, so you never have a stack of units.  Instead, you have bottlenecks.  You can't tell most of your army to go here, another section to go around over there, etc.; you have to tell each unit where to go every turn.  And it rapidly becomes tedious.  You wind up with ""carpets of doom"" instead, which are still unstoppable, just slower moving and more micromanagement.  Yes, there's a tactical element to making sure your archers aren't in the front row.  But as a *strategy* game, 1UPT bogs it down.  Sherman said, ""War is hell"", and in Civ V, that is true.

There are other factors too, however.  The pace of building things is generally slower than in Civ4, which in turn was generally slower than in Civ3.  You don't want it to be too easy to build units or buildings, or there's little tradeoff in choosing what to build.  But in Civ5, it takes so long to build something that it becomes almost boring.

In empire management, Civ5 takes a series that had previously had a model of plenty, of growth, and turns it into a model of scarcity.  In some games, this can be fun - scraping by, slowly building up, seeing rewards.  Perhaps it's because I've played Civ3 and Civ4, but here it is not.  Roads cost money for every tile, but it's enough that it makes it quite difficult to make any money, until and unless you take the right Commerce idea.  Buildings cost maintenance, but it can be quite challenging to make money.  Thus the builder pattern, as well as the warmonger pattern, is penalized in Civ5, and less fun than in previous versions.

There is still the infamous global happiness mechanic, and while less harsh than it was in Civ5 Vanilla, it means you face severe penalties for expanding too quickly - and it's an hard cutoff.  In Civ4, city maintainence had a quadratic component, penalizing expanding too quickly without building up your economy.  But it was gradual; you might moderately hurt your economy and then back off on the expansion.  In Civ5, if your global happiness dips below zero, severe penalties immediately take effect, and worse ones below -10.  Peaceful expansion - including ""vertical"" expansion - is thus penalized as well.

And to add to it, the AI is no more competant than in previous versions, with a particular weakness being the tactical, 1 UPT level.  In previous versions, yeah, the AI was not great at exploiting weaknesses.  But if you neglected your military too much, you would often wind up with an AI invading, and losing cities.  And even bluntly wielded by an AI, a stack of doom could be a serious problem.  In Civ5, it's almost impossible to lose a city.  The AI simply can't figure out how to maneuver its troops to take even a woefully under-defended one.  Now, it is true that it can also be quite tedious to take an AI city, but at least if you have enough patience, it's doable.

So what does Civ V give you in return?  Adorable animated foxes to represent furs on the maps, to start with.  Better graphics than Civ4 generally.  Native language speech for the leaders, which is cool but becomes repetitive in a way that the text-based systems of earlier iterations didn't.  Improvements to the approachability of the UI.  And that promise of a more interesting late game with culture and tourism, if you can make it that far.  Which due to the AI, you almost certainly can in terms of survival; whether you can in terms of enjoying the game is another question.

With the tradeoffs not really worth it, over the past decade I've found myself playing less Civ - and when I do play Civ, primarily III or IV - and more games from Paradox, The Creative Assembly, and Amplitude.

Certainly, Civ5 has been well-received on the whole.  It's entirely possible that if you haven't experienced Civ3 or Civ4, you won't notice  the downsides I mentioned.  But having experienced its predecessors, and wanting essentially an iteratively better experience than CivIV, I found V disappointing, and can't recommend it when its predecessors remain readily available with better gameplay and a lower price."

18572,"A great game, turn based, lots of possibilities for variety."
18573,such a great game!! i highly recommend this game but don't get civ 6 that game is shit
18574,"Excelent strategy game with deep gameplay. But I warn you, it's extremely addictive. :)"
18575,"addicting, really fun"
18576,GG
18577,It's okay.
18578,best game of all time
18579,"Civ 5 is fucking dope. I have amassed over 300 hours and from my experience, this has to be one of my all time favorite games. I know Civ 6 is out but I think 5 is 10x better. I have a lot of fond memories playing this with friends, where I would be clueless as to how to actually play (when I started off) and friends would baby me though the process. 11/10 would detonate nuclear warheads again.

Edit to my review: I forgot to mention how god damn addicting this game is. I've had nights where I'd stay up till 3 in a solo game after loosing track of time. since first writing this I've amassed 150 more hours so I think that proves my point enough. I also have developed a passionate hatred for the French, or at least the game gives me a somewhat reasonable reason to hate them. 12/10,  would hate the French again."
18580,Can keep you busy for hours on end.  Mostly after a rough day at work
18581,is good
18582,Good game.
18583,Classical game for anyone to pick up and play.
18584,The games play well and has good challanges
18585,"I just kept telling myself ""one more turn"" and before I knew it I had played 51 hours in one day"
18586,"Great addition to the CIv series, appears easier to get into than Civ 6. As a long time Civ 3-4 player I found the lack of unit stacking a big change but plays well in the game dynamics. 

Downside has been the poor performance of the game in multiplayer mode"
18587,good
18588,"Very good game, still relevant in 2020 if you like turn based strategies or if you love civ."
18589,good game

18594,cool
18595,"Civ 5, with all the new ""improvements"", like espionage, faith, (much) better AI is the pinnacle of Civ series...
Take care if you try to play it on Linux, having the newest processor types (with more than 8 threads available).
It crashes the game every 2-3 minutes, making it unplayable. Fortunately there is an easy remedy for that.
Great series, great game."

18601,Better than Civ 6
18602,"I used to be a real-time strategy gamer, until I bought this game while it was on sale. It took a game to get used to it; and to be honest, I thought it was trash the first few turns. 340 hours later, and I've played III, IV, Beyond Earth, and VI, and this is simply the best one. I consistently come back to play it, it is an amazing purchase. You won't regret getting this game."
18603,es gud
18604,Just amazing!
18605,"Ten years ago when I played this for the first time, I looked Sid Meier in the eye and I said to him, ""Sid, I love you."" We lived together for another 5 years -- it was the most powerful relationship of my life and I learned what it is to be loved and hated at the same time. All in all, this game good."

If you enjoy being able to adjust every aspect of your starting scenario to your liking, you've come to the right place!  Civ VI is out, and I have not tried it yet, but this version does not lack anything I desire from an RPG.

18625,It is a good and addictive strategy game.
18626,"I like this better than VI.  A few glitches, though.  Late in the game workers need to be told what to do every turn - which is annoying.  Automated improvements does not help.  I like some of the DLC, but I don't enjoy the version with spies and religion."

18635,"IMO one of the greatest games ever made, even a decade after release. The DLC are not just an attempt for more money, they really change how you can play the game (but are not necessary especially for new players). I've been playing for about 5 years on and off. This is the game I come back to when I'm bored with my xbox. I'm in college now but I wouldn't be surprised if I'm still playing this when I'm in a retirement home."
18636,best of the civ games
18637,"Long game. fun yes, bad at game yes"
18638,bing bop boom this game zoom
18639,"I can't rightly comprehend how I haven't recommended this game already in the 8 or so years I've been playing it, but if you have any interest in history or strategy, I can't suggest it highly enough. The learning curve for Civilization games as a whole is a bit steep, but once you've played one of them, you more or less ""get"" all of them! This a good place to start."
18640,Interesting strategic historical game.  Challenging.
18641,"Great game, what can I say"
18642,"
It is a game for you and others to gather around to chill and play (maybe make rivalries too

18657,better than civ6
18658,"Its much better than Civilization 6 in vanilla gameplay. If you get the expansions for Civ 6 though, CIv 6 is disputably better. I recommend buying this game, also because the modding community is absolutely amazing. IMO the R.E.D. WWII mod is the best."
18659,its gud
18660,Great game!
18661,its good
18662,How uncivized
18663,"I know alot of people like this game, and it is somewhat enjoyable, but I don't recommend it. Progress is sooo slow, and the game mechanics are tiresome. The game is text heavy and unintuitive, which means you have to do alot of studying to understand how all the units and improvements work. People who really love digging into strategy games will enjoy this because of how much content there is, but its not really for people who aren't committed enough to learn the perks and tech trees.

Civ VI is a little better than Civ V in terms of mechanics. It fixes some of the issues, but introduces new ones too. Having played both, I'd say I dislike them equally. Ultimately, the satisfaction I get from completing a match is outweighed by the frustration and slow progress."
18664,fuck ghandi
18665,Better than VI

18795,"I really love Civ V. It's a great game that you can play with people you know and form teams to overtake the world, and if you play against the AI then just be prepared to learn quick!"
18796,Fantastic game - great turn based strategy game.  Very much improved from the original Civ games.
18797,Very addictive
18798,"Definitely recommend to anyone who understands at least SOMETHING in global strategies
- better than VI (and cheaper, even freaking dlc's are cheaper and make more sense than there)
- both with DLC and mods you can sit up for dozens of hours ahead
"
18799,Might destroy friendships... pretty good game
18800,One of the greatest of all time!
18801,Its a good game.
18802,It's a fun strategy game.
18803,123
18804,Very good game.
18805,Play with Vox Populi. Game- and life-changing experience.
18806,It's okay i guess
18807,This game is still a gem
18808,Shit init
18809,"I have a trash pc but it runs extremely well. Without extra animations and stuff of course, but even though my graphics card doesn't meet minimum system requirements, the game still runs and very little of the amazement is loss because of it. I love civ games!"
18810,"Amazing game. now its just a broken, laggy, steaming pile of garbage. Sad to see one of my favorites tossed aside and abandoned. DO NOT BUY IN CURRENT STATE"
18811,is gud
18812,cool
18813,+AAAAAA
18814,thinkable
18815,"Amazing game, still enjoying it years later, better than the newer ones and well worth the money, especially if it's in a sale."
18816,its alright
18817,fun
18818,pog
18819,"Highly strategic and absorbing game. There is a great deal of complexity and this game just keeps on giving as you progress through the difficulty levels and the expansion packs. I played this for 104 hours in two weeks in lockdown, be warned. Your GF / wife will hate you haha"
18820,"2,382 hours at the time of typing and just about to load it up again instead of it's sequel."
18821,A game that will have you absorbed for hours on end
18822,Timeless classic!
18823,gg
18824,"Probably my favorite game of all time, this game enthralled me when I first played it, and continues to do so every time I log in. Take control of one of the many unique leaders throughout history, and lead your civilization to victory the way you see fit. Every decision matters, and the balancing act allows you to re-write history the way you want to. Enthralling, challenging, educational, and at times hilarious, Civ V time and time again will have you begging for one more turn."
18825,The great game to dive into civilization series. it can take your whole day without you realizing it.
18826,"Good for many many hours of fun, and probably a better choice until Civ 6 releases its GOTY complete edition eventually."
18827,This game ruined my life for like two years. Run.
18828,I really enjoy that every playthrough is different. Each full game takes a while but it's nice to play with friends.
18829,"Civ II is still my favourite of all time, but this marks a nice expansion into the game world. Figured I would get used to playing this one before venturing into Civ VI."
18830,fun to play
18831,"Yes
"
18832,excellent.
18833,It's good game.
18834,"liked: everything, dislike: you will not go to sleep"
18835,"Love this game its very fun, The UI sorta sucks to use at first but it gets better with time"
18836,yes
18837,This game is absolutely worth every damn penny! many hours of fun while solo or with friends.
18838,.
18839,Better than Civ VI
18840,"It's a fun game and if the fucking thing wouldn't keep crashing while loading to the main menu no matter what I do, I'd recommend it!"
18841,The best game
18842,"So many hours invested in this game, and I plan to invest many more. So fun, and even during mid-game lulls, it takes a back seat to the conversation you'll have while kicking your friend's ass as Napoleon."
18843,very good like your mom
18844,"gr8est strategy game, period"
18845,Addicting as HELL!
18846,"PLAYED FOR 7 YEARS AND SO FAR MORE, NEVER BORING"
18847,"It has Gajah Mada, very nice"
18848,Love Civ from the very beggining.
18849,Good
18850,Still a great game in 2020!
18851,p fun
18852,"teet 
"
18853,Best Civ game by far
18854,"Even though I haven't mastered this game by any means, it's fun even when you loose.. But the best thing about this game by far is how easily you can get into it, unlike a certain other grand strategy game *Cough* Hearts of Iron 4 *Cough*."
18855,"I recently went back to playing Civ V after trying Civ VI and I have to say, Civ V is a far better experience. It doesn't limit you to play in a certain style, and the variety of civilizations and leaders, each with not only a different flavor but with different abilities and units, make the replayability of this game one of the best available."
18856,way better than Civ VI
18857,"With expansion it is a masterpiece!
I suggest it."
18858,i still have no idea what i'm doing half the time. 10/10
18859,"Great game, endless hours of game play to be had without ever getting bored."
18860,time killing game
18861,"Very detailed game that is very addictive. Can get up and running playing the game quickly but there is a steep learning curve... not that you need to learn everything as it is easy to fly through uneducated on an easy setting while you learn about the game. Set aside many many hours, and set yourself time limits otherwise it will take over your life."
18862,Amazing!
18863,better than 6
18864,Good game
18865,"if u get a bad start its over for ya, Unless you've been blessed by Sid Meier himself like my friend has. >:("
18866,I want to fuck this game so hard it is so good
18867,"yeah its good
you need rick and morty level iq to play tho"
18868,ok yuh
18869,joguei essa merda por quase mill horas. Não joguem. Altamente viciante.
18870,I have been playing the Civ series since it began.  This is my hands down favorite one.  Excellent gameplay!
18871,Still better than Civ VI
18872,I would reproduce with this game.
18873,Great game
18874,7ry5 y
18875,i love committing war crimes
18876,one more turn
18877,Game is fun but if you're on windows 10 don't waste your money. I've tried every solution and the game just won't work it does nothing but crash non stop.
18878,very good game
18879,Good
18880,"Game is super fun and sucks you in.

*Fuck Montezuma and fuck Elizabeth*"
18881,"Fun, tons of Civs, and great replay value. Plus, mods and community is diverse."
18882,"I recommend this game for those with strategic thinking who need to train the brain for complicated tasks or just to rest and change the subject of thinking. I am a fan of Civilisation from the 1st day of 1st game and never  stip to play.
Good luck for newcomers.

David"
18883,Cant play it on my pc (windows 10 1909) but i work on my mac dont know why.
18884,Got cool Ottoman soundtracks.
18885,"GREAT GAME

PLAYED FOR A FEW MONTHS STRAIGHT BUT HAD TO STOP CUZ MY LIFE WAS FALLING APART

8/8"
18886,gud
18887,this game got gorilla grip
18888,Yes
18889,good game
18890,Bad game :3
18891,"After trying Civ VI last week, I appreciate how great Civ V was even more and came back."
18892,"Slow pace, fast pace. Easy diffecult. It's your choice. I can spend so much time playing this game and it doesn't get boring. One downside is that the end can be boring. You know you are going to win, you just have to get the victory. You can always just play on a harder difficulty if this happens a lot."
18893,wooow :3
18894,:D
18895,Something Great to do during this time!
18896,don't think I'll ever get tired of this game. civ 6 can't compare.
18897,classic
18898,it is great!
18899,Love it
18900,Honestly better than Civ 6. I've spent hours just chilling on this game. It's a blast.
18901,Civ V continues to crash. Also the requirement that it has to be played online is not cool either..... Civ 4 was way better.
18902,This is a great game with tons of different options to play many different scenarios. Great strategy game to play alone or with friends
18903,"Played for a bit, its ok"
18904,Great game.
18905,"All the SM Civs are awesome, this is my fav."
18906,"Mods, mods, mods!  It can literally be a different game each play through.  AI mods to make the game harder, but in a good way.  The difficulty levels have enough variety to make theme useful.  Civ V doesn't shove P.C. politics down your throat like Civ 6 does."
18907,Just one more turn.....
18908,"Upgrade of previous games, less about building cities and more about managing them"
18909,"Civ is great, It is better than Cats, I will play it again and again,"
18910,It's ok.
18911,"9.5/10

+Very addictive gameplay;
+Different ways to win the game and varied scenarios;
+Great visuals and music
+Just one more turn...

-Inconsistent AI."
18912,Great classic turn-by-turn strategy game that teaches a little history along the way!
18913,i cant play online its stuck on 6 prosent and dosent move its ben like this the past 3 days
18914,yes
18915,"Deep game, played most of the civilisation games over the years...this is the best one for me."
18916,"Fun game, friend epic fail xD"
18917,haha babylon science go brrrrrrr
18918,"Great strategy turn-based game, This version is more streamlined and efficient than IV was, especially in terms of managing units and combat (stacking units is eliminated and the game is balanced so that it's unnecessary to have massive armies). There's more focus on effective strategy, less on just developing an overwhelming number of units. Cities can defend themselves which also saves on the need for multiple units to defend territory. Culture and research/science play important roles but do not detract from being able to focus on playing the game. Setting graphics to 10/11 instead of 9 helps the game run if you have problems launching it to start with. Impressive graphics for the most part for a game this old, although some issues arise from time to time with rendering. Again, this may be a settings or hardware issue but my PC isn't exactly built for gaming, still the game usually runs fine. Overall, it's a highly addictive game which lives up to its predecessors and even improves over previous versions."
18919,One of the first games i got and one of the most fun and relaxing
18920,really fun with friends
18921,Perfect laid back strategy game
18922,This game is super fun especially with 3 or more friends!
18923,i hate put
18924,Its fun once in a while.
18925,One more turn
18926,My favourite Civ!
18927,No playthrough is the same. Different ways to win victories are worth exploring. Mulitiude of game settings add to replayability
18928,Like it very much!
18929,Very good game that still stands to this day
18930,"Still prefer it over Civ VI, solid gameplay, fair length of time for a playthrough, and many ways to customize to your tastes."
18931,"Civ 5 is the definitive Civ. After this they dumbed everything down trying to appeal to everyone in general, and hence no-one specifically (including Civ fans).

Buy this one and collect all the addons with the money you might otherwise have been tempted to throw at Civ 6."
18932,good
18933,"Whoa, I neve thought I'd enjoy strategy after a looong time."
18934,good
18935,"awesome game i love it 
"
18936,Great game to play by your self or with friends. I recommend
18937,Best Civ still.
18938,"Unfortunately a bug with the workers cause them to forget their orders every turn.  This turns larger games into a drag with every turn taking twice as long or more, the frustration will eventually get to you as it makes large games unplayable.  The only solution that has been suggested so far is paying for a dlc that fixes it.  Bug fixes that you need buy are the only reason I can't recommend buying it without dlc."
18939,I do not like france
18940,"This is the first Civ game I've ever played. I'm really bad, but I still have a lot of fun playing it."
18941,yes
18942,better than civ 6
18943,Civ 5 is such an amazing game you can loose hours in this game and you wouldn't even know. I love those mindless games where after a long day at work they just let me zone out in empire building.
18944,"fun, engaging"
18945,good game ngl homi
18946,Big Funny haha very epic all my homies udder dan jerome hate yugoslavia 47/38
18947,good way to kill time and get the brain going
18948,Could be good. I'll let you know after the next turn
18949,Great Game. Super time killer if your into conquering games.
18950,yes
18951,"its good like, civ 6 though better"
18952,"This is a great game if you don't want to fork out for Civ VI save often though, it does crash from time to time."
18953,its the kinda game you can sink into
18954,For sure the most in depth war/strat game there is. you can play for 5 hours and feel like you need to keep going. Amazing
18955,A great time sink. Mods and DLC are both amazingly fun especially to co-op with bros on. 10/10 in my book all day long.
18956,"I don't own this game, thanks for allowing me to write this review :)"
18957,just rush hanging gardens and keep your science high 10/10 great 4x  game. But if your real into 4x games it can lack alot of depth.
18958,Great game even though Civ 6 is also available. Still play it to this day.
18959,"well, if  you turn based games, this is one of the better ones out there."
18960,its fun
18961,it's a game
18962,"Much simpler than Civ 6, and more intuitive gameplay"
18963,The best game of the Civ series
18964,if only europeans had this game back in the day so they didn't have to colonise and enslave actual people. great game tho
18965,"The hardest thing in this game is the first hour.
After you understand the game, it is fun."
18966,It is amazing I have so much fun playing this and You can play it with family
18967,trash
18968,Another great CIV game. The DLCs are worth every cent
18969,"With Brave New World update it becomes payable on all levels, no more being forced to enter a war. Best Game of this type. It is a real journey from start to finish."
18970,umm yeah i'm thinkin be likeyyyy
18971,really really great (and better than civ 6)
18972,Consistently love this one.
18973,Civs 4 is better
18974,awesome game so much better then civ 6
18975,just one more turn
18976,"Well made game, fun to play with friends or against the computers"

18978,goood.
18979,"Just love all the civs so much, so engrossing and chilled"
18980,Good
18981,"I haven't played it much, bit it seems ok."
18982,Great game
18983,A must try. ;)
18984,i love it and its so eager to keep on going in ur game till the end
18985,Sweet Simple Strategic Great Game!
18986,"This is one of my favorite games! It's visually pleasing,  challenging and fun. It is my happy place after a long day."
18987,A pretty good game I guess
18988,"This is better than civ 6 because it actually works all the time,"
18989,yes fun
18990,"As of writing this I have played this game for 4600 hours.  Why would you want to do this to yourself?  Save yourself, remove this from your cart, and get hypnotized to vomit whenever you hear the name Sid Meier.  It's your only hope.
"
18991,Bit good
18992,Nice for passing time.
18993,great game even for how old it is.
18994,"The game itself is brilliant. What is much less is its constant crashing, at least on Ubuntu 20.04. I would have hoped for a patch from the developer themselves, but the solution to the issue is changing some configuration file to ensure that the games uses the proper number of processor cores. Not a big thing, but annoying to have found the solution not on the developer's site, but on a forum. (Perhaps Steam's? I don't remember.) Still, fun game play that will make you forget to go to bed... Like I'm doing right now. ;)"
18995,Very very good
18996,Better than civ 6.
18997,"Honestly, I have no fucking clue what I'm doing when playing this, but I have fun anyway."
18998,Civilization V is the fifth installment of the Sid Meier's Civilization franchise. Every update and expansion since its original launch has added more depth and balance to the game making it a playable masterpiece.
18999,Great game. Hours of managment fun.
19000,"I like creating towns, its a great game to wind down after work."
19001,"If you're into turn-based strategy, then this is the game for you.  Once I start a campaign, it's hard to stop playing...even 10 hrs in!  I'm sure the Civ 6 has some upgrades, but haven't tried it yet."
19002,Easy to get lost  it is so engaging and developed.
19003,Not so sure even at 631 hours
19004,My biggest complaint is if my biggest resourse  would be wine and never get any benifits of it
19005,Fun.
19006,"I don't know if I can call myself a veteran, but I started with Civ II when I got it free from a computer magazine (so that's a long way back...) and I liked it so I went and got Civ 4 (boxed mind you). I'm sure I spent a lifetime in that game and eventually I got a free copy of Civ 5, which I eventually bought again to get the GOTY version which I still play a match at least every month to this day.

Since I started playing Civ 5 it felt like something was missing from 4, but I haven't played 4 for a long time and didn't want to cut points from this review here, so I installed to try again. Nuh it had some nice things but  5 is better in any possible way.
So I was about to write a review about 5 but then I got Civ 6 from that other store that we don't spell it's name, and I postponed the review to see what the next game is about, so I played a couple of hours and went back to 5... it just didn't cut it, the improvements are minimal and so many things changed just to for change.

So here I am, playing Civ 5 again and finally writing my review, now I'm sure it is the best game of the series so far.

The graphics are nice, a great improvement over Civ 4 and I consider them to be better than Civ 6 as well. They are not very colorful, neither dull, the are not very realistic, yet they are not childish or cartoonish either.
You can lower them enough to make the game playable in virtually anything that you can buy today with windows, I managed to play in my Athlon II x2 250, 6GB DDR3 ram and nvidia geforce 710. Not very nice experience in late game but turning on the 2D view greatly improve things in advancing turns, and then return to 3d to play yours.
In my main system that is not great, not terrible I managed to play it at full graphics without a hic (i5 3570, 8GB RAM, Radeon 7850 1GB), I want to test it too in my newer system with the Ryzen 2600, I heard it can greatly benefit in late game from a great CPU.

The sound is great, the music is at what you could expect from Civ. There is only one thing that I miss from Civ 4, and this is the voice acting from the units that where in the language of the civilization you choose. Also Theodora's Greeks are nonsense... pretty stupid for a game of that budget to fail something like that. I don't know if other leaders have the same issue.

The gameplay is greatly improved, I do believe the placement of the UI in general make better sense and it is way more clear and informant than it was with Civ 4 and 6. You can access information about other leaders, city states etc very easy without stopping the game itself, so you can let the turns advance and you can check out the cultural conditions on it's tab.
Social policies are added in a way that make more sense than Civ 4 and works better than in 6 (I see no reason to lose older benefits just because you have new ones and can pick only a specific number to be active).

The AI is not stupid and have specific patterns that follow depending on the leader, there are surprises at first but eventually you know what to expect and who is the backstabbing one. Warmorgering is not working very well, there should be a smaller on no penalty if I wasn't the one to start the war for capturing a city. But overall it does the job and you get rid of penalties for liberating cities. I loved also that I can bring a civilization back in the game by liberating their captured city (if they eventually lost all their cities).

Espionage and Religion is not as big deal as it is in 4 and it takes a second seat. And culture city flipping is not as easy anymore, as it is way more complicated now.

What is the best part that made me never set my eyes on Civ 4 again, is the combat.
No longer an insane stack of units are attacking your city and exterminate you like rats. 1 tile, 1 unit. That's it you need to have tactics now to conquer a city, you don't just rush in with everything you have and hope there are not more units in the city.
Speaking of tiles now they are hexagonical and give you a better use of the field, especially since you need to use tactic in combat.

Anyway this is getting too big, I thing so far Civ 5 is the most balanced Civ game out there. There are things that it could have, but nothing that you will miss. You advance nice and easy, it plays most like Civ 4 without huge differences and most of what is changed is for the better and not just to be changed (like what happened with the transition from 5 to 6).
I enjoy this game and I think there is no reason for anyone who like 4X games not to like Civ 5 too."
19007,"ENDless hrs of clicking...seems tedious, but surprisingly entertaining beyond belief.  Absolutely love this game!!!!"

19012,"Everything, easier, user friendly, easy to understand and control."
19013,I love this game so much.
19014,good
19015,a fun game
19016,"You'll decide to play for an hour and you'll realize four days later that your wife left you, but you're so close to killing that scumbag Gandhi that it doesn't even matter. 20/10"
19017,I like it
19018,"I really do not have the vocabulary to explain what keeps bringing me back to this game. I do not care to win by the destruction of other civilizations so constantly try to win by other means.  However, other games I have played are enjoyable and then I move on.  But with Civilization V I keep enjoying the idea of returning; and I do.  Contrary wise I do not care for Civilization's 4 or 6.  Again I can not articulate why, that is just the way my world turns.  I like Civilization 5.  Sometimes I will start the game but only for the music to play while I meditate or work around the house or office.  (Insert two thumbs up here)"
19019,I'll finish this review in one more turn...
19020,"Yes, is fun and takes boredom out of the day."
19021,Gandhi!!!
19022,This game is amazing. But we already all know that right?
19023,very good
19024,1/10 to many nukes
19025,great game 10/10 still better than civ 6
19026,"Undoubtedly not only one of the greatest strategy games of all time, but possibly one of the greatest games ever made.
"
19027,"A nice game, deep and great!"
19028,I have always enjoyed Sid Meier's Civilization series. This game is great for entertainment. Easy to play and fun.
19029,better than civ vi
19030,"My favorite Civ game, even with 6 having been fixed. It's almost perfect in every way."
19031,This game is terrible. You'll hate it so much you won't be able to stop playing. Good luck
19032,I have no idea what I am doing but it is fun
19033,AMAZING GAME!! GOT HOOKED AND CAN'T LEAVE!!!!
19034,I really don't remember playing this game all too well but I remember I enjoyed it considering I played 200+ hours of it.
19035,"good
"
19036,Really? Just one scenario?
19037,never ever play this game with some dude named pakpuk. JUST DONT
19038,Very complex
19039,"CIV 5, if you want to spend endless hours building cities and hating Ghandi..... You gotta play civ!"
19040,good fun yeah mate
19041,Good game. Don't buy before exams.
19042,"wasted so many hours, and will waste so many more"
19043,it's good
19044,.
19045,KILL THEM ALL
19046,good way to skip to morning
19047,"civ 6 is a disappointment. Civ 5 carries civ 6's heavy burden of existing. This game still manages to have its charm, even after 10 years of existence. I just hope civ 7 is better, and can help civ 5 with its burdens

anyways, Id rate civ 5 a 9/10, being that if you get a shitty start you have a good chance of being fucked if you don't expand fast enough."
19048,Fun game to play with friends. Also is a good grand strategy game. I personally enjoy just messing around on the easiest difficulty but the harder difficulties are also enjoyable. 8/10
19049,I like to play as Saudi Arabia and gain as much Oil & Whale resources as possible
19050,I am a fan of strategy games and this one takes the icing on the cake. This game has multiple different ways to win and that's why I like this game.
19051,d
19052,fun game to play
19053,civ6 is better
19054,Awesome game. Fantastic replayability. Very challenging at the higher difficulties too which is nice. Workshop is also great. Hours on record speak for themselves ;)

19062,Nice
19063,"If you enjoy playing a game that literally takes time away, this has got to be one of the best. You play a few turns and hours went by. Haha.

Great game, fun and engaging gameplay, challenging, and best played with friends."
19064,ship of the line...
19065,nuf said
19066,who would imagine a game so old wouldn't make lockdown boring for me
19067,"Great game, really good value for the money."
19068,good game
19069,An infinitely better game to the Monopoly Kids of a sequel they released after
19070,Note to self - never play this stupid game.
19071,cid mmeir be lik ::: make funny game
19072,CAN'T START
19073,"How could I not recommend a game that I've spent 5,000 hours playing? I've played every Civ title in existence, as well as FreeCiv, and to me, this is the pinnacle of the series. I enjoyed every iteration from vanilla to Brave New World, and experimented with virtually every play style. However, you must understand that every Civ player has their favorite and most often for entirely different reasons than the next guy. For me, the combination of Religion, 1UPT, and the culture/tourism mechanic hit my sweet spot. I am having difficulty adjusting to Civ VI, the cartooney graphics detract from my experience and the civilopedia is sorely lacking in useful information. If you skipped Civ V for whatever reason, you should probably reconsider and give it a chance especially if you can pick up the entire bundle on sale. The DLCs change EVERYTHING in regards to strategy, so don't try vanilla and give up!"
19074,good
19075,good
19076,One more turn baby 100/100. Multiplayer is buggy still but I have had some of the best times with friends or myself in this game.
19077,"One of my favorite games of all time, I would recommend it to anyone a fan of strategy games as it has so much depth that even at 500 hours in I still feel like there's more to discover in regards to strategy. I love this game so much and truly believe it stands as the best entry in the series."
19078,"Welp, won my first Civ game... 51 hours in.... O.o lol needless to say these are INCREDIBLY LONG games. Like, murder-you-while-clipping-your-toes long. Lol perhaps just for me but I have found it much easier to commit to actually finishing a game by doing the following:

1. Break the game into four to five phases.

2. Phase 1: The slow start. If starting from the very beginning ages, this is the slowest part but very critical. The early researches affect early strategies while quickly explode into EXTREMELY LONG TERM INVESTMENTS. I'd say this phase takes roughly 100 turns:)

2. Phase 2: Deciding desire. Upon reaching said 100 turns, you've made some big decisions in relations to expansion/cities. At this point you are either solidifying your fourth city or half way through the empire of another poor soul. In some cases, you haven't fought anything more than barbarians, but now you're ready. Over the next 30 turns your relations with other empires will either strengthen or begin to become unease. I decided to wipe out the others on my island, for-say. Weird that it impacted a lot of other-island relations.

3. Phase 3: Expansion. Whether via trade and peace, or in my case, sheer empire size, by 200 turns its time to look beyond my island or surrounding domain and to scale up globally. At this point, I had explored the maps entirety (apart from the center of one mountain ridge in an opposing island). Over the next 80 turns I had firmly rooted myself in the last remaining island (where three civs resided). Need I mention that by 150-200 turns, I realized I could do one of two things: ally myself with the world OR obliterate it because I had muskets and they had stick swords.

I decided obliteration while I was ahead. I also knew the long I set up my empire, the longer longer longer it would take to overtake the remaining civs needing to be overtaken.

4. Phase 4: Wrap-up. At this point, I'm hoping the victory will be as gratifying as the EXTREMELY LONG investment. It was definitely nice that the newly researched tanks were far superior at city-overtake than my previous methods.

And by 310 something turns... it ended. O.o Really abrupt and not very satisfyingly:( Welp, now that I know it will take 4-5 gaming sessions of 2-3 hours each, I am much more prepared to NOT spend all day in one match and rather split it up:)


So yes, its fun:D It's also amazing how diverse the playstyles are. I tend to focus on economy until my gold output can justify purchasing my armies whereas my pops focuses on classic ""I'm just gonna destroy you from the get-go and because everyone knows I AM SO MUCH STRONGER AND HAVE MASSIVE ARMIES"". lol my dad is amazing at these games, no idea how he has such a phenomenal presence. 

Anywho, I do recommend! Just be willing to be okay with investing a lot of time into one game. I found that breaking the game up into phases (or rather ""multiple games/stages"") helped significantly with staying committed:)

Also also, the Hawa'ii guys are the coolest. Just saying. #firstwinallthewaythrough #becausethegamestakesolong #finally #bringiton"
19079,"Impossible to not pull an all nighter when playing this game with friends.

10/10 would play all night again"
19080,"I like the workers, wonders better, and no districts, as with the cheaper DLC's."
19081,Civ 5 is one of the best Civ versions available. It runs well on my older Mac
19082,v good
19083,The best time-suck game I've ever played :-)
19084,great game
19085,fun turn based strategy game
19086,"its okay so far, a lot more depth than I previously thought."
19087,"my first playthrough was 11 hours long, hell yeah"
19088,amazing
19089,Dont play when you have finals or a job of any kind.
19090,yes it is cool
19091,awesome. the og!
19092,excellent game
19093,"Runs well on a mac. Old mac at that. 2011 Pro. No glitches, no crashing. Only played on default settings so far, but runs great! Fun strategy game!"
19094,"Yeah, it's alright."
19095,"Yeah, it's alright."
19096,"It's a classic ""not a learning curve, but a learning wall"" type game, but it's doable if you follow your Advisor's recommendations. You can end up with some truly whacky scenarios in the end."
19097,Easy to learn but hard to master! you will loose hours of your life playing this game! you've been warned!
19098,"Its managed to waste lockdown like it was nothing, brilliant"
19099,"great game
"
19100,"Best Civ game ever
"
19101,fun and deep game
19102,Great game!
19103,I have played Civ 3 a lot years ago. Due to covid and new computer started to play civ 5. Initial reaction is that civ 3 is far superior but I may get used to civ 5 in time. Very different scope and way to play which seems very laborious and slow paced but I have only been playing for a few hours after long lay off.
19104,it's fun with others
19105,10/10 just one more turn kinda game
19106,great game to soak up some hours with.
19107,a good civ building game
19108,amazing game
19109,"A little fun, would recommend"
19110,good game
19111,good
19112,yes
19113,it be good
19114,"Very much recommend! The game is fascinating and unique from other games I usually play. The game challenges you to have multiple focuses at the same time (between production, science, generating gold and others), micromanaging A LOT of things at once. But that's what I think is fun about it. You can also team up with friends either against one another or against the computers. My buddies and I love that feature, which changes gameplay a little bit since now you are on a team vs being by yourself. What you research and/or build may be different."
19115,"This is the game that forced me to create a Steam account. In fact, I purchased the game on physical disc (back in 2011) hoping to bypass the need to create a digital library but the game would not have it any other way: Steam account needed! Anyway, I was a Civilization series fan so I created the account, and started with a negative opinion of the game.

More than 400 games into my Steam library, this still remains one of my favourites. Like most (all?) Civilization games, this has aged very well. If I recall correctly this was the first game in the series to move to hexagonal tiles and disallowing unit stacking. Both of these mechanics provided a different dimension to strategy, and geography became even more important than before for frontier cities - as it is in real life too.

There are also other mechanics that made this game so much different than the previous edition. But this is usual of the series: new editions aren't incremental upgrades over the last. Indeed, Civilization V can provide a different experience versus its predecessor or successor so that the game never really gets old.

One small caveat is that expansions of this game did change game mechanics significantly. Particularly the introduction of Tourism took away the earlier way of Cultural victory; and considering that Tourism is a core feature in Civilization VI I simply cannot see this addition as useful."
19116,Great Game!
19117,i liked 4 better personally.
19118,It's good stuff
19119,Very people very shit. My friends always flame me for taking too long. Muliplayer is ass cuz u can't just silently jerk off in a corner cuz there is always someone pressuring you. It's not a relaxing game. I swear eating bougars out of your nose is a better way to spend your time than this shit game. The different nations are fun but where the fuck is the fire nation. Give me fucking fire lord ozai. Overall this game might actually be a great game as long as you don't play with your poopieass friends.
19120,"Sometimes when playing marathon for several hours, the game would quit itself, forcing me to remember all the task and homework I've postponed. A nice hidden feature, but I hope Firaxis will make an option to disable it in the future.

10/10 Would play marathon again!"
19121,Great time killer
19122,JUST ONE MORE TURN!
19123,"good game, but the fucking multiplayer never works for more than a hour."
19124,its awesome
19125,"great game to keep you busy for hours, especially if you have that one type of friend to shuffles ALL of his tiles pops every turn."
19126,much better than civ 6 and still better than civ 6 gathering storm. There are some things I like more in civ6 (namely resources and power) but civ 5 is still just better. One bad thing is unstable multiplayer.
19127,its k
19128,"I enjoy this game just for a mix of history, RISK, and domination"
19129,multi-year player; great game!
19130,"I have learned that the Mongols tried to stop Chinese hordes with The Great Wall and failed, the Aztecs conquered the Roman Empire in BC 1260, and the absolute pinnacle of culture is pop songs and blue jeans. 
10/10 accurate history simulator"
19131,stupid poo poo game very trash
19132,"Absolutely trash AI that can only win by cheating.
You can save an AI civilization's life by restoring its capital to them and give them another city with it that belonged to them (that they lost due to war with another AI) and they'll still say you suck for being a warmongerer. 
Diplomacy is pointless. Just kill everyone.
The fact that they got that ""right"" is the only realistic part of this game when it shouldn't be.
Screw off"
19133,There is no peace.
19134,"Generally a slow paced, but fun turn based RTS."
19135,Great Strategy game still 30 bucks tho after like 8 years but steam sales will bring the price way down. Best if played with it's 2 main dlcs Brave New World and Gods and Kings.
19136,time sink yeet
19137,"cool
"
19138,"just one more turn,

19142,"is really gud

19143,its swag
19144,i've lost so much time send help
19145,good strategy game but very hard to get an understanding of the metas and mechanics
19146,Better than civ 6
19147,It's ok I suppose
19148,"Best game in the series. Just beware, your social life will suffer."
19149,s
19150,It's CIV with nice KI and superb graphics.
19151,It is well-remembered for a reason.
19152,Entry level Grand Strategy with equal amounts size and depth. Is gud.
19153,its aight
19154,"get civ 6, this one is still worth it if you cant buy or run the new one"
19155,better than number 6 low key
19156,awesome sauce
19157,"its a pretty good game, wait for a steam sale and you'll get this for an absolute steal"
19158,"Noting
"
19159,"Classic Civilization with too many scenarios to count. I'm a working 26 year old and while some people think this lacks certain elements, I've got my hands full over here hahaha. I'm used to playing Civilization Revolution on console and moving up to this level has been overwhelming and exciting. I'm not the die hard civilization player who devotes 10 hours a day and needs cross-play with pc multiplayer to enjoy the game. Idk what Civilization means to you but if you're looking for a great strategy game with a lot of options for play styles and lots of management this is the game for you!"
19160,10/10 great game
19161,beyandım
19162,Originally bought the physical copy of this game and probably played several thousand hours. When it went on sale on Steam I figured I would get a digital copy as well. This game is still great and many prefer it over VI.
19163,good game
19164,Easily one of my favorite games. Can be as complex or as simple as you want it to be. 10/10 would buy again.
19165,i love the civilization games from the 1st one
19166,ALL IS BEST
19167,"Bit late to the party, but I've been playing Civ V for over 6 years now. No need to upgrade to any newer games, its still hard and unforgiving as hell (who honestly can play it past King?), and it has aged like Meryl Streep (i.e. incredibly well).

In short, this is the Devil wears Prada of games. Fun, lighthearted, timeless, and with an incredibly cutthroat AI (yeah Gandhi, I'ma talking about you)."
19168,"One of the most addictive games out there - you can sink a LOT of hours into it!

As for the game itself, you've probably heard of the Civ games already, but in case you haven't: It's a turn-based strategy game reminiscent of the Catan boardgames, albeit much more complex. You guide your civilization from its cradle into the future, while founding new cities, discovering technologies, interacting with other civilizations and much more. Just give it a try!

In contrast to other games, it is also very relaxing, as you aren't under any time constraint whatsoever. Even the soundtrack and the announcer voice stay with that theme. I also like the aesthetics in this game much better than the cartoony style of Civ 6.

Overall, this game is perfect for just winding down after a tough day with your laptop in your lap*.

*Edit: The horrendous lanucher is essentially just a way to present ads. It adds no value except directx options, which you could change elsewhere, and is (officially) impossible to disable. One of the effects of this is that Civ V is a pain to play via in-home streaming because you need to walk to your main PC and operate the launcher, since it won't let you do that on the Steam Deck or a client laptop."
19169,"Never thought I would like a turn-based game this much. The base game (+DLC) is just fine, but playing it with the vox populi mod is most definitely the ultimate civ experience. It certainly beats both vanilla civ 5 and civ 6 and I can't go back to either of them. Highly recommended just for that mod alone."
19170,"Nice
"
19171,gud
19172,"it pretty good
"
19173,"Great game, has some process issues but other wise is well put together."
19174,Fun game.
19175,Just one more turn... 7 hours passes
19176,"Recently playing civ 6 as it became free on the epic games store has reminded me just how good civilization v is, as a civ game, and as a strategy game on the whole. Just play it. You will enjoy it. this is a fact. It is the best game in the civilization series, and still stands as a great game 10 years after release."
19177,Better than other games like Rust or The Forest
19178,good game
19179,hi 69
19180,One of the best strategy games of all time. Its very addicting for a turn based game that makes you want to keep playing for hours on end.
19181,love this game
19182,"classic strategic city builder
"
19183,"It's a good game to learn several things including a little about history, politics, economics, etc..."
19184,also bad
19185,fun
19186,good game
19187,"I liked absolutely nothing, yet enjoyed every moment of it."
19188,6>5
19189,its ok
19190,"very good
"
19191,"Nice Game, better than civ VI"
19192,Good one. The leaders animations are amusing.
19193,over the course of 5 years and two versions of Civ I have never been able to successfully play 1 game online with my friend would not recommend.
19194,"This is a great iteration of the Civ franchise, and I actually like this version over Civ 6."
19195,A fun turn based strategy. Good for both advanced and beginner's to the world of Civ.
19196,yes.
19197,Still good to play even though it came out a decade ago.
19198,"I love this game. It's as fast as you want it to be, and it's a really fun game. 10/10 would buy again.
"
19199,"I used to play CIV1 and CIV2 in the 90s. I think I used to play CIV4 too many years ago. 
Best game of the lot, I don't need anything else..

Classic"
19200,"I usually get tired of games some time before the 100 hour mark, but this one never gets old. 
Very addictive. Very enjoyable. Highly recomend you give it a try"
19201,It's fun
19202,its good.
19203,"Great game, very in depth, but easy to get in to. My first Civ game, and I'm just getting started!"
19204,Very fun but how do you make a city?
19205,Best Civ game in the series.
19206,Apparently I've played this.. :/
19207,mega colossal pp game
19208,get it
19209,"Classic game, outstanding"
19210,fun
19211,"This game is good. Like really good. 

The game is actually one of the simpler 4x games out there. That does not mean it won´t take some time to get into, lucky you! They have scenarios that help explain mechanics pretty well. God I wish I knew that when I started. I would also recommend getting the complete edition because it changes some things in the game for the better. 

So the game, you build your own civilization. You could play it single player but it really shines att multiplayer when you and your friends are raging against each other. You can do a lot of things to mess with others and you can win in a lot of different ways. Your friend tries to go for a diplomatic victory by uniting all the city states? Well of course you feel the need to add the same city states to the glory off your empire by conquest. He starts building a army to take over the world, well lucky us we can vote in a standing army tax increasing the maintance cost of that army by 25%. Maybe he finally made his empire happy by adopting order, well lucky us we have a lot of tourism to him and once his citizens realise that freedom is 10x better his people will be very unhappy with anything else. In fact when he adopts freedom it just becomes easier since we managed to make the world ideology Freedom in a earlier world congress. Eventually we will win because every other nation wish they where us. 

And that is only a small sample of everything in the game.
Highly recommend.
9/10. 

Ps: Never trust the Ai!"
19212,i love the game
19213,its okay
19214,"good ?
yes"
19215,Fantastic game.
19216,Great game to just chill with.
19217,Iroquois are underrated. People misuse them as aggro. They are a great turtle-in-the-woods civ. Go science and culture.
19218,the best game ever!
19219,👍
19220,I guess it's okay
19221,Fun game.
19222,gg
19223,yeet compatible
19224,"It is the best version of the Civilization series.  Civilization VI is a joke - bad game play, baby graphics.  Civilization V is complex, involving, entertaining and respects it's players as thinking adults.  It has enough depth of strategy play to enable it to be played again and again - numerous maps, scenarios, characters/civilisations, levels of difficulty and many game options."
19225,"It's all fun and games being last place in the world of jungle until the universities discover the atomic energy hidden in the rainforest and you nuke people so much that everyone is forced to call you the supreme leader under threat of total nuclear annialation.

19233,"no review over now for fun fact

The red kangaroo (Osphranter rufus)[19] is the largest surviving marsupial anywhere in the world. It occupies the arid and semi-arid centre of the country. The highest population densities of the red kangaroo occur in the rangelands of western New South Wales. Red kangaroos are commonly mistaken as the most abundant species of kangaroo, but eastern greys actually have a larger population.[20] A large male can be 2 metres (6 ft 7 in) tall and weighs 90 kg (200 lb).[21]"
19234,Once you get into it
19235,Good game.

19243,the best CIV game in my humble opinion
19244,It's alright I suppose
19245,doalldntrump
19246,"good all around
"
19247,"Even though civ 6 is out with a good amount of content, civ 5 is definitely worth trying out. The game holds up pretty well, if you like turn based strategy games then the civ series in general is probably up your alley. Different civs have different play styles and bonuses to exploit, so you can always have a fresh strategy with each new campaign."
19248,"You can nuke your friends.

10/10"
19249,Excellent at basic explanation of power interaction.
19250,Excellent
19251,This game is perfection.
19252,Just forcibly converted all other nations to Catholicism 10/10 would crusade again

19257,"Legitimately one of my favorite games of all time. Recently buy a new PC with a high end Nvidia graphics card. Suddenly after playing the game for years on a crappy laptop with no issues, the game starts crashing on the new PC. After a ton of research, I found that this is an issue that has plagued a ton of people who have been trying to let Firaxis know about this issue since at least 2014 and they've done nothing. It's insanely frustrating since I just bought the rest of the available DLCs a week or two ago. And I get it... why spend resources on patching an old game when you want to sell a newer version? But that doesn't change the fact that it's garbage customer support and that's why I do not recommend buying this game or any other version of Civ."
19258,"Love this game, I've played a minimum of at least 240hrs :) So addicting!!"
19259,"This is a terrific game, especially with the DLC.  Hours of replayability with the various leaders and different rules that you can implement."
19260,"Had fun with it 10 years ago.
Unfortunately it turned up to be unplayable in 2020 for me. The mechanics are just too slow, and multiplayer is laggy. Better go and try out the sixth one."
19261,Great strategy game. Never tire of it.
19262,loads of fun can get lost for hours
19263,it good
19264,"Very good game, it created many great memories with friends and requires quite the strategic mindset to master."
19265,This is an overall amazing game. Whats not to like?!
19266,<3
19267,The penultimate classic strategy game!
19268,"Like so many other games I like, there are several different ways to play and win Civilization V. Playing Germany with raging barbarians is one of my favorites for a military win, Korea for a science win, etc,."
19269,I MEAN I DO AND DONT 1st all the civ games are not set up well with steam links on steam to sdks and tools to mod do not work at all they just reload launcher and do nothing its very sad how steam gatekeeps the modding resources and cant even make there launcher use friendly to get these tools very sad the games fun so i recoment it for base game but if u want to create your own leaders or anything dont bother with steam its ludacrus
19270,love it
19271,"Great game, in fact i prefer it to Civ 6 BUT!!!!!
[b]WAIT FOR A STEAM SALE.[/b] for the love of god do NOT pay full price for the dlc. I bought this game on a whim bc it + all the dlc was like. 20 dollars or less idr. in any case, just do not pay full price for the dlc. wait for a sale, PLEASE"
19272,Best CIV game since CIV 3 IMO
19273,No off line playing. Dehhhhhh
19274,Still the best turn-based strategy game out there
19275,Just buy it
19276,It's alright.
19277,"Civilization V with Gods and Kings and Brave New World is the best version of Civ you can play right now hands down. It is starting to show its age with it's load times, but otherwise it is still the one I play the most. Highly recommend with both expansion packs as it truly fleshes the game out."
19278,One of the best strategy games of all time. I like the mechanics of the game and the replayability.
19279,i have been a fan of the Civilization franchise since my first encounter with the original in the 1980's on an Atari ST - I am still on Civ V as my current computer doesn't have the specs to run Civ VI.  Each version has been different and each has been enjoyable in a different but similar way.
19280,Very good addition to the Civ games
19281,not bad
19282,I love this game and it's better than 6
19283,"just good
"
19284,5 is greater than 6
19285,.
19286,"[h1]Fuck CIV 6[/h1]
CIV 6 is a fucking cut version, CIV5 can be bought for $ 5 with all dlc

19288,Great Game
19289,:)
19290,"What can I say, Civilization V still is a great game. That is it playable on Linux makes it even better. I am sure I will spend many more hours playing this game!"
19291,"I have played ~30 multiplayer games, have not been able to finish one yet, not for lack of trying. Every single time a desync error has ended a session. There is no fix. awful"
19292,One of those games you'll start - look outside and the sun is already going down. Whoops. Worth.
19293,"The mutliplayer is the most fun thing about this game. To bad it doesnt work, ever.

nvmind we got it working"
19294,p decent tbh
19295,good game bro
19296,good for multiplayer
19297,Mom gets mad sitting too long. Great game.
19298,A classic.
19299,This game is good.
19300,"Probably a top 10 game of all time for me. Seriously there has been 2 more games since this, Civ 6 and Civ: Beyond Earth. I have played both, and still come back to Civ 5 for its superior game."
19301,Didn't even finish the tutorial yet.
19302,legendary game that is worth its reputation.
19303,This game is good
19304,masterpiece
19305,"Fun game, 'till one person gets slightly ahead of you"
19306,"This is a quintessential turn-based strategy game. It is as if a complex board game was directly injected into the digital world. The systems are straightforward enough with a little practice, and the depth of strategy possible is astounding. There are enough civilizations available so that every person can find a fit to their own playstyle. I love it to death."
19307,Great game!
19308,good game
19309,"As of the time of writing this, it is impossible for Mac/Windows users to play together. This appears to have been done intentionally by Aspyr, as it hasn't always been the case. However, I cannot in good faith recommend the game until this issue is resolved."
19310,it fun
19311,absolute banger
19312,I like the game play but what I don't like is how warlike all of the AI's are.
19313,yes
19314,"well balanced
"
19315,its good trust me im the guy who asked
19316,its a really fun historical simulation game
19317,"/
"
19318,its great
19319,Yea its alright
19320,I have no clue what i am doing but it's good fun!
19321,One of the best strategy games ever made
19322,Civilization V is one of the best board games I have ever played. This game is a lifer and has many lives. I have the complete series.
19323,"This is the best civ game by far. Dont waste your money on civ6, its horrible, even for free (Get this instead). I have played countless sessions, gotten most of the achievements. This is the only game where you can have an arms race with Gandhi and nuke him with Giant Death Robots, or a nuke in general"
19324,"Civ V is by far the definitive Civilization experience. Newer Civ games can't hold a light to the grand strategy of Civ V.

By itself, however, it still holds up. The amount of things you can do and the ways you can win in this game allows for a great 4X strategy experience that not a lot of other games have been able to emulate. Each 4X game will provide its own unique experience and to me Civ V is the best one."
19325,"fun game, relaxing, lose track of time doe"
19326,"LOVE Civ V.  WAY better than Civ VI which is too cartoony.  The animation in VI slows the game down to a frustrating pace even on the fastest setting. So I rarely play VI - playing V pretty much exclusively.

So why the thumbs-down for V you ask?  Because it no longer supports cross-platform play.  Use to have epic games with friends/family which is no longer possible.  Thumbs down!"
19327,"Very good, in my opinion its better than civ6 however thats for you to decide this is simple and easy to get used to and addictive! <3"
19328,god
19329,"The best Civ.

Pros: It's not Beyond Earth or VI.
Cons: Science is busted as hell"
19330,good
19331,Much good.
19332,The one game to which I always return.
19333,väri nais
19334,"best Civ from the series at the moment, better than Civ VI now the Civ community moderators are the worse, got banned permanently just because I was criticizing Civ 6, they got offended by it, the community are moderated by SJWs which get offended by everything you say."
19335,pp
19336,Only clinging to this game becaue Civ.6 makes me cry. please never give my workers 3 turns
19337,"A good entry in the series.

Lots of changes I welcomed. Compared to previous Civ games, this one features no more stacks of doom(tm). This means that during war terrain becomes actually important, as you need to spread your units as opposed to just stacking them on one hex/square and steamrolling to the enemy city. I also really like how cities can now actually defend themselves, it makes it easier to play as a peaceful civ. 

The graphics looks competent even 9 years after release. Not that it matters that much, since in these kind of games it's not the graphics that matter. 

The interface seems really user friendly, with all the information required being only 1 or 2 clicks away. 

The Policies and Ideologies system is also a nice element, making playing towards cultural victory more powerful and interesting. 

There games does poses some flaws though. I really didn't like difficulty levels above Prince, where the AI just gets a stat bonus and nothing else. It does't seem to behave differently, it just gets resource and tech bonus on the start of the game and that's it. Makes it feel like the AI is so dumb it's able to pose a challenge only if it cheats. 

Additionally, you can't go into the next turn until you give an order to every unit and city in your empire. It becomes a huge pain when you're conducting a late-game war and you've got an army of 50 units spread along the enemy border. 

Oh yes, and on a side note diplomacy seems useless. Even if the AI civ is ""Friendly"" it might still attack you.

Apart from that, the game has all the traits of previous Civ games. It creates the ""one more turn"" addiction syndrome by making sure there's always something going on and that you've got goals to strive for."
19338,You can play for hours on end without realizing time has gone by.
19339,"Prepare to say goodbye to your friends and family because ""just one more turn"" is never just one more turn"
19340,Old style but still entertaining
19341,fun game with the dlc's
19342,Enjoy this one.
19343,Good game
19344,"a nice game to play. nice graphics still, running on low end PCs."
19345,"Obviously I love this game, wouldn't have put in more than 1000 hours otherwise.  Sometimes the AI can be wonky and all leaders seem super aggressive despite supposed differences in styles, but still just a super fun game"
19346,Very fun and in-depth
19347,cool beans
19348,It's brilliant. Best strategy game ever.
19349,"One of the best games I've ever played. Civ 6 is not bad, but feels far too bogged down in comparison. Not that this game is easy - far from it. Just a beautifully balanced, and immersive game where you can go 750 turns without starting a war with anyone, or you can turn into a brutal dictator who picks fights at anyone who coughs in your direction. I particularly enjoy the battles to become allied with city-states. Beautifully illustrated maps and the music and narration is excellent. The AI occasionally makes really bizarre decisions, so I recommend playing it on one of the harder difficulties."
19350,v good game to play with friends
19351,Best game in the series.
19352,"+Super interesting
-You may be lost from your normal life for a couple of days"
19353,"Game crashed after a 2 and a half hour session and I had to find out the hard way that autosave is not enabled by default.

EDIT: I was very angry, it's good."
19354,"After playing civ since the 4th to 6th, i daresay that CIV5 even after 10 years still hold up strong and seem to age well past its decade."
19355,"Play, Crash, & Attempt ""Fix"". Rinse & Repeat for many hours trying to get it to work."
19356,Captivating action!
19357,REEEEEEE
19358,My absolute favorite turn-based strategy. Holds up after all these years and has seemingly infinite replay value.
19359,Very fun
19360,"Pretty complex, but also pretty awesome!"
19361,good
19362,better than civ 6

19369,It is addictive and it's always 'just one more move'. lol It's a competative game whether playing alone or with your friends.
19370,LOVE IT
19371,"This a amazing game, mods are fantastic as well"
19372,Spent  11 hours playing the tutorial before I realized you cant win it
19373,n1
19374,"its sick get it, get the dlc too"
19375,Very Good.
19376,"It's a fun, engaging game; what's not to love. Play and take over the world, journey to space, whatever, cause you're in charge as world leaders from history. No go get your CIV V game on."
19377,Highly addictive whether you are a hardcore turn based strategy player or a newbie looking to get their feet wet in the genre
19378,World congress sucks but overall fun game
19379,One of the best strategy games ever. Highly recommended.
19380,CIV 5 really needs a remaster to play more smoothly in terms of graphics but the gameplay is really really good. If CIV 6 turned you off with how over complicated they made it and way to many mechanics (in my opinion) then CIV 5 is the one you want.
19381,"Devs bricked the game because they want you to pay for Civ 6

what a joke. they did the same with civ 4"
19382,I have been a long time fan of Civ 5 and to this day still play it. I would go so far as to say that it is better then any of the later installments of the series.
19383,aaaaaaaaaaaaahhhhhhhhhhhhhhh
19384,Do note that there is no refund for lost friends as a result of mass genocide.
19385,is gud

19389,oui
19390,Incredibly boring.
19391,Great game. Time murderer.
19392,IT IS AMAZNG IN EVERY RESPECT!!!!!!
19393,Imagine you're playing Dark Souls but it's all in your head.
19394,"I like the part where I build things and stuff, and I like when the AI spams me with info, it reminds me of the good ol' days."
19395,Poland with nukes is gg

19397,A Solid Game

19400,Best CIV game ever.
19401,good

19404,cool game
19405,very good game thanks jagex
19406,nm
19407,Really challenging with the Vox Populi third party add ons.  Frustrating and addictive.
19408,"My favorite Civ game, and one of my favorite games overall.

This game led to a great many sunrises in college."
19409,"Probably one of the greatest time-burning games of all time. So many strategies and ideas and variables add up to make a hell of a game that takes hours to put down. Words cannot describe how fucking fun this game is. 


(Also fun fact, you can queue up city productions)."
19410,"One of my all-time favorite strategy games. Even years later, I still keep coming back to it."
19411,If ever there was a game to capture my heart in the most beautiful of ways; a game to make me laugh simply by the silliest of occurrences that re-write history as we know it; a game to make me feel empowered and unconquerable in victory; a game to make me feel unyielding and defiant in defeat; and a game to relax me in a time of my life when I needed it most... it was this game.
19412,Never trust the AI.
19413,"Not reccomended for people who only have an hour of free time a week. this will eat up so much of your time. the 200+ hours I've got? that's just my online hours. over 1,000 hours easily."
19414,good game
19415,"The only real issues I have with this game are the lack of UI scaling for 4k resolution, and the the fact that the multiplayer portion of the game feels like it was developed as an afterthought. That said, this game has been one of my favourite on PC for almost a decade, and I can't recommend it enough."
19416,Still good
19417,Good game.
19418,I've lost weeks of my life playing this game and I gotta say it's the best game to slack off with and will have you doing stuff for days.
19419,"Really fun (dated now) game -- a bit simplistic because of it's date. I honestly appreciated the game play more than I did for Civ 6 (only played demo). Downfalls were issues with the ""faith"" system that didn't really click. Ranged characters and high terrain was pretty crazy too. (And the normal AI issues)."
19420,good game fun w/ others
19421,das
19422,nice
19423,is good
19424,funn\game
19425,"hours of my life spent, only to lose it all to raging barbarians"
19426,If you like simulating being the dictator of your own country on a conquest of beating the rest of the world in a variety of ways. This games suits you.
19427,"Hm... I thought I had already reviewed this game... Civilization V is a classic, and it is heavily moddable, instead of it's flawed successor. This makes it a game that you can play for decades (unlike it's flawed successor)."
19428,game go play no play VI play V now
19429,lol ghandi nuke xd
19430,Excellent depth and mechanics. Really addictive game for those who love strategy.
19431,"""Hands down best game I have ever played.""
-Me for the past ten years.
"
19432,It's good.
19433,"Highly recommended, very habit forming. A few  suggestions, canal building, bring back piracy and caravans."
19434,its great
19435,"it's fine, I guess"
19436,"Would I recommend this for overall health? Definitely not
Would I recommend this if you wanted a crippling addiction? yeah"
19437,One more turn....
19438,"If you want to play a good Civ, play this one. Not Civ VI!"
19439,"cool game
"
19440,killing savage barbarians is fun
19441,"Civ games are always quality and no 1 game is the same, love these games"
19442,I like it
19443,Need to dedicate alot of time to learn but great game
19444,Best Iteration of the game.
19445,"I saw a new earth and heaven, the holy city."
19446,Holy this can be fun. Its a yes from me
19447,"great game to play, many varied civs and can win in a lot of ways! great to play with friends!

Kinda of complicated to get used to and learn all of the inns and outs but are many good guides to help new players on their way! also some of the religion just seems unbalanced and just useless as many of the bonuses they give are just really worthless. 

but overall great game to play and fun to keep replaying!"
19448,is good
19449,Recommending because steam asked me to do so
19450,"Decent game but not as good as Civilization IV.

The only reason I would want to play this game is to play together with my girlfriend because otherwise there are many better games out there.
 
Unfortunately the ability to play cross platform between PC and Mac has been broken for many years which is unacceptable and I will probably never play this game again because of it."
19451,goated game
19452,No need to write anything - look at my playing time ... and yes I don't have a life!
19453,i liked the gameplay
19454,"good game, fun with friends
"
19455,10/10. Best Civ game in the franchise (at least until VI gets more expansions). Easiest to learn on if you're trying to bully some friends into playing.
19456,"This game is an addiction.  Pure and simple.  Easy to understand, but full of depth to explore.  Constantly progressing and racing for victory.  Is the AI stupid?  Yup.  Are certain Civs really REALLY unbalanced?  Yup.  Is it a fun time? YUUUUUUUUP!"
19457,"WHat I love about Civ 5 compared to Civ 6 is map layouts and graphics, i prefer the way you purchase workers and they stay alive longer than in CIV 6. I dont like when you invade a city , the crowd turns against you and unites with another country and all your work goes to waist. I prefer purchasing fishing boats versus using your worker.  I wish they would develop a civ 6 that almost mirrors Civ 5, but allow all of the new mods to the game, giving you the choice if you want to use them or not. I will continue to play Civ 5 over 6, until changes are made"
19458,Fun!

19465,Best one out of all civ's
19466,"ever-green, timeless"
19467,I likey da game.
19468,"Meh rating. i dont care for these damn pirates raining down on me constantly. i own the island and they keep showing up. would like to build up the towns instead of more combat units. so, a meh rating"
19469,Vastly superior to CIV 6
19470,its good
19471,"Start the game on deity (Hardest Level) 
Spawn next to Mongolia and The Huns 
Try to make friends or build an army 

10/10 Would be annihilated in 20 turns again. 

Could have been worse, Add Gandhi into the mix and I wouldnt have seen the second turn.  

"
19472,A well set up game with a lot of play options! Easy to lose your head in and find out you've played for 10 hours without noticing! #onemoreturn
19473,It has a little something for everyone.
19474,"It's video game Drugs, once I started, I couldn't stop.
"
19475,"10 Years later and people are still playing this over Civ 6. Not saying Civ 6 is bad, but Civ 5 was the superior game. Mods give the game extra flavor, the big DLCs for Civ 5 are a must, they improve upon the original game. I'm also wondering why I haven't given this a review yet. It's a great game."
19476,One of the best turn-based games ever. I rate it even higher than Civ 6.
19477,"A fantastic turn based game.
"
19478,It's Civ V you know.
19479,"""You've played for 928 hours, Would you recommend this game to other players?""

No. If you value your social life, do not play this engrossing 'just-one-more-turn' game. Sleepless nights will be had just to see if Shaka captured your capital city, pyramids and all. Nearly as good as the Alpha Centauri legacy Sid Meier has from before this."
19480,i just realised i have played 702 hours on this game [laugh_emoji][laugh_emoji]
19481,Can't stop playing
19482,Beter then Civ 6
19483,heh heh heh camel archer go whoooossshhhh
19484,I liked that it was multiplayer and that you could go to war with your friends.
19485,Poland asked me to go to war against america. i said yes. america gave me new york in exchange for peace.
19486,Fun

19496,The best of the Civ games.   Very replayable and challenging.
19497,"It's actually a great game with all it's dlc. I can't speak for the base game but I can speak for the game with all dlc. With all the dlc, it is expansive and fun. The hours that I have had with this game are fun and always different. Multiplayer is fun and just as chaotic as singleplayer. In addition to all of this, the modding community is great and I have recently been playing with Iska's modpack which makes the game completely different now. With all of this in mind, there is content for thousands of hours of gameplay making this a must have for 4x players."
19498,"IT'S LIKE CRACK, BUT IN A GOOD WAY"
19499,Game is old but dope
19500,"good
i like to do it sometimes"

19504,"Al around great game. Personally prefer over Civ 6
"
19505,Its a fun and interactive game. Keeps you thinking strategically.
19506,if you haven't played this game buy it do it. super fun and will dump hundreds of hours into this game
19507,I wish there were some QOL improvements but overall the game has a lot of replayability and can be fun
19508,its ok
19509,Pls help I have a problem.
19510,I love civilizaton since PS1
19511,"Old but gold. Like CIV5 more than other titles. Unfortunately they've skipped the Colonization-part.
Much content in Workshop to modify your game or play challenging maps."
19512,Brilliant game.
19513,"Cant get enough of this game, it's an absolute masterpiece"
19514,haha game good
19515,havent won a game in 81 hours
19516,I will never get bored of this game.
19517,"Great strategy, fun games. Rush great library"
19518,it's ok
19519,I bought Civ Vi but quickly returned to Civ V. I much prefer the graphics. The game is well balanced and fun. I just wish it didn't take so long to load!
19520,"while this game is not as intricate as 4, I like the variations between the different leaders and it's challenging to try and win using very different tactics that favor each leader."
19521,not mediocre
19522,"It's a decent game, I enjoy it. I've had some lag issues and some of the AI isn't that amazing but I enjoy it"
19523,Its good
19524,Really nice
19525,"Yep, it's a good one."
19526,Its civ V. Enough said
19527,Very fun. Modding opens up a whole new range of possibilities. Multiplayer and extensive game configuration provide extensive replayability. You'll start a turn and suddenly it's 3 AM.
19528,"Probably the best CIV gme ever. I love these games as they are entertaining, eductional, and can be played at your pace."
19529,much fun
19530,Just completed my first game
19531,dont buy civ 6 it is not the best this is the best
19532,One of the best strategy games I've ever played
19533,"Working out a successful conclusion is mentally relaxing. Sometimes the obstacles can be a bit frustrating, but they are essential to the game."
19534,itz good
19535,good
19536,"really great game preferred it to civ 6, hopefully the next release is better"
19537,"It never gets old.

Also Gandhi is lethal."
19538,Much better than CIV 6.
19539,fun
19540,It's a good game.
19541,"Best Civ game by a landslide. Yes, I have played them all."
19542,I've spent 47 days of my life on this game and it was completely worth it.
19543,"A must-have for players who like strategy games. Highly recommend buying with expansions, it has huge value and opens many more ways to play to game making it even more complex."
19544,"gastei uma noite toda pra perder pra um indio no final, vale a pena (y)"
19545,haha funny wonder spam
19546,Fun game. Can play it over and over again with different combination of settings.
19547,"Good strategy
"
19548,Its a game where you think youll play for a half hour and when youre done its 5 hours later
19549,"Its civ. its good
"
19550,"monkey see, monkey nuke"
19551,good game
19552,"I basically aim to defeat america and other colonizing countries each time I play, especially if I play as an indigenous group."
19553,good gam
19554,Good Game
19555,"This is a great game but it doesn't actively get updates or new content anymore, and you can no longer crossplay between Windows and Mac. You should just buy Civ VI instead, it's a better game in my opinion now that the expansions are out."
19556,great  time killer
19557,"Civ 5 is probably the most addicting game I have ever played. The one more turn mentality is a real thing and each game is never quite the same. One game you may be dominating and be a friend with all the other civs while the next, you are backstabbed and always on the defensive. It may get repetitive sometimes with the building mechanics and building up your nation, but it is still very satisfying building your nation and grow attached to each city that is built. Overall, Civ 5 is a classic and should be bought if you are interested in the 4x genre and is very easy to get into if you do not know much about the genre."
19558,Dis is easily one of tha best games I've ever played and it makes you think hard as hell i recommend dis game to all types of players and it's fantastic fo both single and multi-player both in large and small groups
19559,Played a game with england as an ally. Started game with friendlys ended with no friends (other than england) and i didnt declare war on anyone... even the city states hated me 10/10 love it would play again. Honestly game is amazing
19560,"Everyone. I come before you today as a gamer that only plays mostly FPS's and other games like that. I was told to pick this game up by a friend, I had major doubts at first, seeing the pictures, how could this game be good??? It looked like a total snooze-fest. But, despite my gut feelings, I plunged into my first game, not even playing the tutorial, I'll be honest, I was going to trash the game to my friend after not even playing the tutorial, it's scummy behavior, but, I have found the errors of my ways. This has been quite possibly the most fun I've had playing a non-fps game in such a long time, sure, on my first game, I got absolutely annihilated by some barbarians, but on my 3rd or 4th go, I was able to actually win my first game!! Granted, it was against npc's, but honestly, that didn't even matter to me. I've finally fully completed and enjoyed my first game. I highly recommend this game, no matter what games you usually enjoy."
19561,Perfect
19562,"Great, especially with all the DLC"
19563,"better than civ 6, sorry bois"
19564,"this is a well balanced older game, where you get to decide which Map, Number of Participants, Historical Time Period, Terrain make up, etc, etc, etc... ."
19565,"Drained 57 days of my life into this game so far, multiplayer can be absolutely terrible, a bit glitchy and AI can be questionable. 10/10 would recommend to anyone love this POS game"
19566,gg
19567,great game and with mods from the work shop if you get board witch i think you wont
19568,"I've been playing the series since Civ3 and I LOVE Civ5. 500+ hours doesn't lie. (And no, I don't leave it on overnight.) It's a fun time sink or a cool mulitplayer game."
19569,"In summay, I endorse this game. They really nailed what it feels like to rule a civilization at different stages of history. The gameplay slowly becomes more sophisticated as your civilization does.

I played the game in order of difficulty: Settler, Chieftain and then Warlord. Warlord had 2-3 scary moments where I thought I might lose, so it was actually the funnest for me so far. 

On the Warlord difficulty, I started with an early expansion effort. Eventually, I needed to focus on a win condition, which I knew from playing on the easy levels. From there, my strategic choices fed into my win condition. For the science victory, I wanted to avoid war as much as possible. War was declared against me though, so I needed to invest in a military and weaken the enemies. I could not delay or slow down my scientific progress too much because I could miss my spaceship launch by 2050. It was also risky to switch to a military victory because, by Warlord difficulty, the cities get harder to conquer relative to Settler and Chieftain.

If you are intrigued with that kind of thinking in a video game, then yes you will enjoy Civ 5.

My only gripe with the game is a technical one; as the turn count gets high, the AI takes really long to play. E.g. 30-60 seconds. It's an older game, and Civ 6 is out now. I think it unlikely that this is going to be optimized any further."
19570,"The vanilla game is boring a bug ridden, a game that feels incomplete and abandoned without dlc is a bad game"
19571,Very good!
19572,awsome classic game
19573,"Best for wasting time lol
"
19574,It's eh
19575,Good Gaem.

19579,Its good
19580,The South Shall Rise Again
19581,good
19582,yes
19583,Hands down still the best civvy game. I hope Civ 7 comes back to it's Civ5 roots and gives a great immersive experience that doesn't look like a WoW cartoon.
19584,The best strategy game ever.
19585,"Hey kid, Ya ever Crush a grown mans hopes and dreams? Well now ya can do it over and over multiple times.
"
19586,I've been in war for 9 million years and still going
19587,"Have always loved Civ. First video game was Civ III and I played it until that PC died and beyond. Civ V is amazing, Only tip, keep a standing army as per usual the AI in this game love attacking when you want to be peaceful. 10/10"
19588,Games pretty good. Way better than Civ 6
19589,1234 hours played.......
19590,good game
19591,"big mun, but big fun"
19592,fun game
19593,Gameplay is straightforward. Timing is everything. The game never really truly ends. It just stops when you need it to. :)
19594,game good?
19595,Just one more turn...
19596,tu vois plus le temps passé
19597,"Sid Meyer's makes the best turn based strategy games around, hands down. If you like turn based strategy, this is a must play"
19598,is a good game!
19599,good
19600,its a classic!
19601,"Fantastic game, Ive been playing it for the past 4 years at least. Would still reccomend to this day, far better than civ 6."
19602,its a very good game
19603,"TOP TIER
"
19604,"A classic 4x that everybody plays.

Vanilla sucks though so buy an edition with all the DLC."
19605,876rtzoiuztdsdftz
19606,Played the game for 200+ hours and havent yet finished a multiplayer game.
19607,I always go back to Civ 5.  I play Civ 6 now and then but I like Civ 5 so much more.
19608,Mint
19609,This game is amazing. I have played it so much. There is so much detail to learn about the game and become great at it.
19610,"Great RTS game. 
Second best RTS after Civ 6(Tied in first place with Age of Empires 2)."
19611,I have played every civ game from 1-6 and this one is by far the best. dont waste your time with civ 6 it is nothing compared to 5
19612,"Love CivV! Great way to forget about COVID craze. Is it midnight already, past time for bed? One more turn:)"
19613,Stands the test of time.
19614,Incredible and thorough — great game.
19615,It's quality good content
19616,"Just realized that I haven't reviewed the game. The base game is in a good shape and has many new improvements compared to civ4. The modding capacity is good, too."
19617,A great game as with all Sid Meier's titles just improving on perfection
19618,better than VI
19619,"Where has my life gone!!
"
19620,It's ok I guess.
19621,i like nuke
19622,"WHAT...THE....HELL. i started this game 2 days ago and i can not tell you how many tomes i keep watching that sun run....just one...more....turn. this game is horrible i wouldnt recommend it for your life,"
19623,Pinnacle of the Civ series
19624,"Very good game to relax on, chill with some friends, and unwind. I would greatly recommend."
19625,Oh man so good oh man i just shidded myself.
19626,p fun with friends
19627,I loved Civ IV. I like this one. Civ 6 not at all
19628,"look where you are... comparing civ 5 reviews to civ 6 reviews, you know why.... its cause you miss this game"
19629,good game
19630,A classic.  Not much more to say.
19631, v
19632,"Very good game like really good game but it is very loud in the loading screen i cant hear my friends in discord rn because it is so loud i just heard the vision of prosperity moved. p.s very good
"
19633,much fun
19634,great game
19635,A very relaxing fun game.
19636,Hours played speaks for itself.
19637,"Pros: Great strategy game that keeps you guessing - (why did Japan attack me again?)
Cons: Kills your laptop, also why do Japan keep attacking me"
19638,great game
19639,not club penguin
19640,its all fun and games until the gandhinator unleashes his arsenal
19641,"beautiful. truly a masterpiece
"
19642,"Civilization V is a great strategy game, and so far, for me, one of the best."
19643,"Its Civ, you know what you are getting into. 1 more turn will easily turn into an all nighter."
19644,good
19645,"This is the first really bad Civilization game I've ever played. Civ 1-4 were great. This game is worse than garbage. The user interface is unintuitive. The  inability to stack units is bad. You can build endless units and never capture a city because you can't overwhelm them. Two divisions of troops can't occupy the same thousand square kilometers? Who's idea was that?

Who had the dumb idea of ranged archers when the scale is hundreds of miles? Ranged weapons could make sense for artillery, missiles and aircraft, but an archer isn't going to shoot arrows at a neighboring country. Nevermind the really poor game creation decisions, this game feels like work to play and it never got any better."
19646,"This is probably one of my favourite strategy games of all times, and I doubt I will ever get bored of it. You don't need a good gaming PC to play this game - an office computer can handle it pretty well. This game is substantially different from its successor, so feel free to but the fifth version before or after playing the 6th. A solid 10/10, definitely recommend"
19647,Quit reading this and go buy it! You could be conquering the world by now!
19648,Awesome game and extremely addictive!
19649,Better than 6 and with a better mod scene.
19650,"Enjoying it so far, just not sure why I don't have all the civilizations yet, like Babylon, Korea, Brazil, etc"
19651,"Although Civilization V is a great board game styled video game, ultimately it is flawed in many respects. Most notably the AI and how its difficulty is set. I won't go into the details but every game hits a point where it feels like a grind rather then challenge. Not too mention the strategy elements are lacklustre when compared to something like the Total War series.

Overall the game is not perfect, but it still is fun in an kind of addictive way. If you like strategy games you most likely have already played this series, but if you haven't its worth a buy... On sale."
19652,This is a great game to play with friends or even just by yourself. Literally the only issue is there is no longer any cross play between windows and mac.
19653,good
19654,"It's a civ game, I enjoy it"
19655,is good gaem very like to play
19656,"Soooooo Addicting. Sit down to play for 2 hours, you'll play for 12. Not up for debate."
19657,Good game. Addicting!
19658,good fucking game.
19659,Best Civ game I have ever played. Well better than Civ VI. Highly recommended!
19660,Fantastic game.
19661,Just like it!
19662,the game is absolutely dope but be warned there is NO crossplatform play between mac and PC and ASPYR are being capitalists and so are not interested in patching this game
19663,"So, this is perhaps the best of the whole series. I've heard that Civ 6 isn't that much better.

Either way, this is a fun game if you're into history or strategy (or both). Choose a nation, then live out their history. Simple as that."
19664,Best Game
19665,Love the game
19666,Cool game
19667,"good game, although buggy at times"
19668,"best civ game out
"
19669,A classic
19670,It is one of the best games I've ever played.
19671,ty
19672,"So addicted, just one more turn..."
19673,"If the deal isn't good enough for you then WHY DID YOU PROPOSE IT!?
-Me to the AI nearly every game"
19674,The classics never get old!
19675,"very good, english bois are gay"
19676,Such a great game would def recommend for all ages
19677,perfect game to get drunk and listen to fukn bumping dupstep for a few hours.
19678,This game is not supported for cross-play with windows from Mac and is garbage
19679,This game is worth to have in your steam library. I can't compare Civ 5 to Civ 6 because Civ 6 is not a complete game yet. Buy  this game during a sale.
19680,The game is broken but damn is it fun when it works
19681,"It's good, better that 6"
19682,Feels like I'm finally getting the hang of it. Great game.
19683,Easy to learn
19684,"It's a fun game. It's very hard to get into and play at a high level. However, if you're fine with potentially losing to the computer and just chilling, you'll find yourself playing ""just one more turn"" until you're falling asleep at your computer."
19685,i rate it
19686,Esta muy bein video game
19687,Fun.
19688, good
19689,very  nice
19690,is rly gud
19691,"It's Civ, I probably can't tell you anything you don't know. I have 156hrs into this. It's peanuts for Civ but I have definitely gotten my moneys worth."
19692,"For people who like strategy games, this is a must.  Many different variations and levels to play.  You can play alone or online, and you can win in many different ways.  Love it."
19693,"This is a fantastic game. There are a lot of little details that you need to explore
"
19694,Very good and drains all your free time
19695,Is good and really fun to nuke your friends. I never get to nukes tho because usually we either quit or someone gets wiped out and we restart the endgame might be total shit but I like everything up to the modern era just fine.
19696,Just finished my first game
19697,i just played all of the games just cause i like the game
19698,would you like to enter a trade agreement with england
19699,"I've mostly played single player, but the few games that I've played with friends were amazing."
19700,"new to strategy games?

I was in between full civ 5 complete edition or civ 6 base game since I had never played anything similar before. I went with 5 plus some mods and while I'm sure I haven't delved too far, I am addicted already. great game thanks for distracting my boredom.
 :)"
19701,Favorite game of all time
19702,I really enjoy playing this game. It can be challenging when trying to conduct a war. For me it is because you can not merge your troops to create an army but instead you have to send a bunch of single troops and that tends to take for ever. And if yoiur playing in single player the NPC's can get a lttle greedy when you try to trade with them... but other than that it can be a fun game to kick back and relax with
19703,washing ton is hawwt
19704,"Game is much better after eliminating city states, which required continual sieges.  There are some peculiarities, nations declare war on you then attack someone else."
19705,"I've been loving this game so much! Play vs friends is great. Playing against the AI is also fun. Has so many Civ's to try out, plus the modding community make that number even higher. Has amazing replayability. Would recommend"
19706,"Started playing civ 2/3 many years ago, this brings back memories of childhood and nostalgia whilst modernising the game and keeping it fun to play, would definitely recommend."
19707,Game is really fun.  A bit slow so far however I have only played about three hours and I was playing multiplayer.  But overall I think its fun.
19708,"Soothing, Minimally violent.  For those of us addicted to achievement, it is very satisfying."
19709,great strategic game
19710,If you like strategy   this is it
19711,"if you like turn based strategy games you'll like this.  lot of actions to learn, but easy to pick up."
19712,es good
19713,Gandi + nukes = Civ V
19714,yes
19715,this game have it all!!! well not all but mostly all
19716,"Without dlc it lacks any variety between matches and gets stale, without dlc there are bugs that have been unfixed for 5+ years, without dlc the game just gets boring."
19717,"play a few dozen hours to understand the game, have fun for a few hundred hours more.
Don't trust Gandhi"
19718,This game can be very complex and I usually play it as a global domination. You can change any setting to how you would like to play. Dont change the CPU difficulty though. It only gives them free tech advantages and production  so far beyond your capability they just crush you.
19719,"fucking amazing
"
19720,"Highly addicting, complex game with at least 50 hours of fun playtime. Just spend the time to learn the game by watching tutorials in Youtube first. Buy the complete edition and try every victory condition. Just completed Time based victory on King with Poland and Science victory with Korea on Emperor and had a blast. Looking forward to cultural victory in Immortal!"
19721,fun until they made it so you cant play cross platform. now it sucks.
19722,Better than its successor forever and always <3
19723,"Fun and enjoyable strategy game
"
19724,Best civ game thus far

19794,I like this game quite a bit.
19795,"Can't say enough good things about this game. A true classic in strategy games. This is the number one game I would recommend to someone looking to get their toes wet with strategy games. 10/10, make sure to wait until a sale and get the complete edition though, not worth playing without Brave New World (expansion) in my opinion."
19796,yes yes yes good

19801,"Combined with my second Steam account, I have collected about 1500 hours of pure joy. This is my all-time favorite game, still better than the newest installment, Civilization VI."
19802,"This is an absolute crap game. They have not enabled cross-platform playing. So, you want to play this with your friends and don't all use macs or windows? Too bad, you cannot play it. Ridiculous."
19803,Far better and way more fun that 6. Also cheaper and it can play on anything onwards an i5 2nd gen with integrated graphics or a c2d with a gfx card. Highly recommended
19804,makes fun. spend 10 hours straight in it. a game takes longer than taking a shit after taco bell on a drunken saturday. 10/10 would buy again.
19805,I have yet to win a domination victory.
19806,"I've played over 400 hours and years after its release, I still look forward to playing. I think 6 was a step down."
19807,"If you have friends to play this game with, just get Civ 6."
19808,Good game
19809,Its cool
19810,"Been one of the best games since release.   Great gameplay, AI, graphics.  Hours and hours and hours of fun."
19811,"game go pew pew but from birds eye view
"
19812,"no hitler, bad game"
19813,Still great in 2020
19814,I prefer Civilization V to Civilization VI
19815,the game is litterally just good.
19816,"I can totally say this game will entertain you for hours at a time. Mind you, ten hour stints of this game can feel very much repetitive. I have enjoyed this game thus far for 200 hours and have only played as a select few characters. It is a good long term strategy game one can play."
19817,"One of the greatest series ever made, also one of my favorite games in the series. Super replayable, and always a blast. Get this and play it if you've never played it."
19818,Good game.
19819,72 hours and still feel like a beginner
19820,"Addictive, will have you losing track of time for hours, if not days!"
19821,"Great game
"
19822,Hot Seat is the best feature
19823,Hours of fun along with interesting interactions with people and AI alike
19824,"Of course I recommend Civ V!  You can nuke Gandhi, for goodness' sake!  Or you can nuke AS Gandhi, which is even better!  Too bad you can't be Hitler, but I suspect there is a mod somewhere for that.  Haha!  
"
19825,ghandi is good yes
19826,if you like building cities and empires it is for you
19827,Been playing for years and still to this day its better than all the new ones.
19828,thumbs up
19829,this game is cool
19830,My first civ game and I have to say it's pretty fun and addicting. Still have a lot to learn about the game and will be happy to.
19831,"This is a highly addictive game that should be approached with great caution by casual gamers, since even a very short exposition to its gameplay has proven to cause a permanent, irreversible state of dependence. Or, as some other people might put it: this sh*t is good, man..."
19832,"liked IV better. this game takes forever between moves to decide what other civilizations are going to do. makes me feel like I need to get up and go do the laundry why I wait. The diplomatic relations between civilizations are more restrictive, with less options, than the previous version. Overall a downgrade."
19833,"I have loved this game for years, it's still the best in strategy."
19834,intresting mix of units. Great choice of maps.
19835,What even is the multiplayer on this
19836,It good
19837,"I've only recently come back to steam after a hiatus. First thing I downloaded was Civ 5 since my original copy was gifted to me through the App Store. I wanted Steam Achievements so here I am! 

Civ 5 was my first ever turn-based game. The strategy and complexity drew me in immediately. I had to think beyond winning by force by learning to win building up a civilization's culture, technology, religion, relations with smaller city-states, etc. All while keeping an eye on the overall happiness of my people within my empire. It makes you really have to think, if you were in charge of an entire empire, how would you rule? Would you care about the health and safety of your population? Would you pick social policies and iIdeologies that would focus on healthcare? The economy? The military? Would you focus on science and education? Would you want your culture to be the most influential in the world? 

As the game famously asks....""can your civilization stand the test of time?"" 

An awesome game that really keeps you stimulated but you can also become lost in it. I've deff pulled a few all nighters with this. Mind your time playing! :)"
19838,"This game has a delightful modding community - exactly what keeps a game alive for years, even surpassing its sequel."
19839,I like the simplicity in earning the achievements at my own pace.
19840,"Excellent Game...    Although dated, for purposes of PLAY, of choosing and executing both Tactical and Strategic plans, Civ V is Far Superior to Civ VI."
19841,q fun
19842,"Great game, way more fun with friends but cool still even without. So many ways to play!"
19843,not sure how to win via anything other than domination
19844,Nice
19845,I Can Now Build Lego City
19846,"its good, can be annoying, all i have to say"
19847,Great place to start if you've never played a 4X or Civ game before. Runs great on my ultra old laptop.
19848,I literally quit smoking by playing this game.
19849,noodlehead
19850,"Excepting that civ6 came out almost instantly after I got civ5 making me seem obsolete it is still a good and challenging game. Very colorful. Many hours of playtime. Epic in fact yet things go faster and faster in the game just like life does. Although I pushed the up hand, still after all is said and done, I recommend that you move on to civ6 though."
19851,"very good
"
19852,HAHA GOOD GAME
19853,its a been a good way to waste away the short lifespan that either god or some demon forced upon myself.
19854,pee pee poo poo
19855,its fun AF
19856,This ain't it chief.
19857,love the gameplay its very engageing
19858,"A world where you can colonize the colonizer?  Yes, please."
19859,It's fun
19860,its a good strategy game
19861,Wonderful game
19862,"By far my most played game. I do always use some mods to spice things up a bit, but it is always worth playing for someone into strategy games."
19863,It's fun. You should play it if you like strategy games.
19864,Awesome! 11/10! U even can send Poland to space!
19865,"Good ol' fashioned accrue wealth/ make enemies game, like monopoly but completely different and actually enjoyable"
19866,"Bad ass game, graphics a bit flaky but game-play can be very complex.
Tip, push forward pretty hard."
19867,Fun game
19868,great
19869,"It's nice that there's a slow rollout instead of having to be perfect at everything from the start, strategically, and i love that it still feels like the game i grew up loving, just updated."
19870,Best CIV imo. Recommend playing with friends though as the AI is no worthy opponent. On higher difficulties they're just equally stupid but receive unfair advantages that make zero sense.
19871,Fantastic game. Returned to 5 after being disappointed with 6.
19872,Love the multiplayer display
19873,i enjoy all Sid Meirs games
19874,"i played few games..... very interesting

저도 몇번 해보지 않은 입문자인데 재미있는거 같긴 하네요....
워낙 고수님들이 많아서 이세계는  조금 더 해봐야 알꺼 같아요....

"
19875,"Bery Nice.
"
19876,yes
19877,Better than Civ VI
19878,"very nice, very time consuming, very fun. 10/10"
19879,ye
19880,Yes
19881,"I played a bunch. But not as much as Civ IV. 

It's good?"
19882,I think that if you have some experience with some of the other civilization games then go right ahead and give  Civ. V a try. Plus the graphics are insanely good in my opinion.
19883,"muy bien
"
19884,makes ur friends angry
19885,better than Civ VI
19886,good
19887,This game is fun to play and it has some world facts in it. I would recommend it for ages 7 and up.
19888,"mediocre 
"
19889,This game is like stupid chess
19890,No longer works on my computer!
19891,Impossible to not like this game
19892,Great game.
19893,Still by far the best Civ game with superior graphics and gameplay to Civ 6.
19894,Bodypillowism will live forever in the hearts of all that believe it.
19895,"Civilization V is a masterpiece of turn based strategic gaming. It is like playing an extremely in-depth board game with hundreds of interesting features that make it endlessly replayable. I love reading, listening to, and viewing the historically accurate works of art."
19896,It's not as if I hate this game or anything.
19897,Favorite recent purchase. Highly recommend.
19898,fuck city attack
19899,"Multiplayer is completely broken. DLCs are $30 10 years after its release. You can crash a multiplayer lobby by spamming the chat. At this point, do not support this developer."
19900,Very fun. Kills Time
19901,good game
19902,There goes many hours I wont get back
19903,AI cheats a lot just beware of that an you're fine
19904,Care for Gandhi
19905,A+
19906,only play if you are interested in a trade agreement with England
19907,"This game will consume your life, but in a good way."
19908,super fun game
19909,nukes
19910,Good level of replayability and visually compelling.
19911,getting every wonder sniped by bots really does make your autocratic side show
19912,good
19913,"Loved every turn of it!!!
"
19914,If you like strategy games this is ideal.
19915,Fun
19916,"Tasty stuff
"
19917,pretty epic game overall but a couple of bugs
19918,i liked the game
19919,"love it, great game"
19920,"good game
"
19921,A UNIT NEEDS ORDERS
19922,"this is an all around great strategy game that has amazing game play, its great however as a newer strategy player ive incountered something of a learning curve, thats to be expected from games."
19923,Great
19924,Wise choice
19925,<3
19926,"Good game, would recomend."
19927,"F you 2k for the new launcher. Pushing ads for Civ6 and making a launcher that fails to launch the game...I was considering buying Civ6 but if it's unplayable as soon as Civ7 releases then I sure will not. Unfortunate, it's a great game, pls fix."
19928,It's alright.
19929,Civilization is one of those god-dam games which you have to try and go through at a break neck pace trying to out play your enemies for 10 hours only to hope that you can win at the end but someone has built a rocket one turn before you! Great game.
19930,Fun times... beware of Gandhi
19931,"Time goes by after 1 hour of the game until u realized the sunrise has come. [i] bye good grades [/i] 
8/10 for BnW ep"
19932,"My absolute favorite. Game got me investing so many hours and even when times got busy, I still found myself unable to resist clicking the next turn button."
19933,An extremely good game. You will not regret your buy
19934,Very interesting strategic game that genuinely keeps you up at night
19935,yes is fun
19936,Good ass game that stills holds up. Get it with the two big DLCs since they add a bunch of nice stuff and are also required by most mods anyway.
19937,"Fantastic. I've played more than 2,700 hours. Buy this game"
19938,Great game 10/10
19939,If you're thinking of buying Civ 6: stop. Reprimand yourself. Buy Civ 5.
19940,Kind of a shit-fest if you try multiplayer since you need to consider the time it's going to take each player to complete their turn and then multiply that by however many people you're playing with.  But single-player is still a lot of fun and enough to make this a recommend.
19941,CLASSIC.
19942,Great strategy game
19943,One of the greatest games of all time. OF ALL TIME!!
19944,"Remember, no Russian."
19945,its ok
19946,This has taken over my life.
19947,Its ok
19948,Civilization V is a classic and a total beast of a game. Almost to 1000 hours.
19949,just one more turn lol
19950,"Great game for those who have math mind set, still problems with stable online hosting, crashes resyncs not fixed since game released"
19951,ITS AWESOME
19952,Yee
19953,"The Best Civ game yet.
Better than Civ 6.
I cannot have enough of it.
1300+ hours and counting."
19954,"Very good very fun.
Just won my first science victory! SMASHED IT"
19955,"Timeless 4X strategy with enough depth and replay-ability to keep one occupied for hours, if not days. I turn to highly involved games like this as a welcome distraction, given how involved they can be. Having playing Civilization 2, Civilization 3 (some of the expansions) and now Civilization 5, I can easily say Civ 5 is one of the best - despite not being a huge fan of the City States. I do, however, really like that cities are now more defensible than ever before. Ultimately, if you enjoy classic 4X games, Civ 5 is a must have for any video game library."
19956,Great game - better than CIV 6
19957,game gud
19958,mother russia nuke other civ to win
19959,Good game
19960,dangerously addicting
19961,"200+ hours in, and still so much to learn every new game."
19962,"i like all of the ways you can do things,like you can fight,make farms,fish,build,and so much more!"
19963,An amazing and addictive experience.
19964,"If you dig on other Civ titles, this is a no brainer."
19965,This is one of the best games ive ever played
19966,The best part of the game is a new map to explore every time.  I like the resourcing part of the game far more than the battles.  i would play the total war games more than this if the maps changed with each new game.  The new world every time makes this game interesting.
19967,meh
19968,Great!
19969,good till the bouncer came
19970,I like all the civ games in their own way but 5 is the one I keep coming back to.
19971,Amazing game.
19972,"solid
"
19973,Now I know how alcoholics feel.
19974,I'd play this game over CIV VI any day.
19975,A great turn-based classic to fill the hours of the quarantine with.
19976,good
19977,"Great game, better than Civ 6"
19978,Probably the best Civilization game ever made!
19979,play the game
19980,Korea and nukes
19981,"Hands down my favorite Civ game. Especially after the 2 bigger expansions, the game became even more fun and challenging.  The diplomacy as, always, needs work but it's forgivable because the game is so much fun to play. When it comes to 4x style games, they have to have some kind of replay appeal. This isn't a one time beat all and that's it. This game sucessfully draws you back game after game after game. Each game is uniquely different and can infinitly be tweeked to make it that much more challanging or easy. I can go on and on praising the game., Just go play it for yourself and see what it's all about. You won't be disappointed!"
19982,Really fun game. Always find new and better ways to play. Highly recommend it. AND it works on Catalina (Mac)
19983,"I have played Civilization for over 20 years now. Civ IV was full of bugs but the game play was simple to learn. Civ V is unnecessarily complicated and requires too high of grade of hardware to run at a reasonable speed, considering it doesn't have fast action going on. It seems like the developers still cannot get a decent AI to work. It tends to get real hard, real fast. I wish I could get my money back."
19984,"Great flow, a new age classic."
19985,This is extremely detailed and realistic.  Hours of entertainment.
19986,played this game for 1200 hours + and still love it
19987,10/10
19988,good
19989,"This is one of my favorite games of all time.  Tons of replay appeal and I've learned all sorts of interesting tidbits about history and culture from playing, too!"
19990,better than civ 6
19991,awesome game
19992,Good stuff
19993,Excellent!
19994,Do you want to waste years of your life in front of computer screen? This game is how you waste years of your life in front of a computer screen.........
19995,"Beware this game! You will lose yourself to it, and you will love every minute of it."
19996,Radical
19997,Immersive
19998,"I don't really know, I love this game and on the other hand, it is very frustrating.

It is my first civilization game. I was impressed long time ago but having played endless legend, I can say this opus is pretty bad without the DLCs and even with the DLCs it still lacks of replayability. the disappointment comes largely from the culture choice and then from the AI. Indeed you always need to pick liberty without the DLC, then rationalism otherwise you will be outclassed. With the DLCs you will be distanced if you don't pick Tradition though I am still trying other culture path but keep loosing. What the point of having different cultures if they are useless? Pick the honour first and you will be dead before reaching the renaissance, unless you play 1v1 or a map of 4, though I managed to loose anyway. No I don't see the point to take honour. And about the AI, it cheats and will start with two settlers and two warriors depending on the difficulty level. Could be better but the game is a little bit old now. DLCs are also too expensive, wait for a mega sale and buy the whole game or don't play it."
19999,.
20000,i like this game
20001,at least somewhere usa may win the war and be first in space
20002,"This game is never the same game twice.  Tweak the settings, play whomever you want to be, and go take over the world!"
20003,it just an overall great strategy and civilization based game
20004,soooo good. still soooo good.
20005,gut
20006,"Addictive.
"
20007,YEah
20008,A good solo experience especially the expansions. The difficulty levels can be adjusted to match you play.  Never played multiplayer.
20009,It's Civ. You're gonna like it.
20010,"Listen - I Downloaded some player made Mods and Used Palpatine & Vader to lead my Civs to defeat Batman of Gotham during a Zombie Plague that was destroying everyone.
BEST GAME EVER!"
20011,is god yes
20012,ye
20013,"Sid Meier's Civ V is a great tool for honing creative thinking, goal management and multi-tasking skills. Beautiful artwork throughout and a great soundtrack. If you want a big finale in victory this is not the game for you, but if you seek endless hours of creating and adventuring, with dynamic AI interaction, I highly recommend this game."
20014,"I'm experiencing a bug where I'm having to tell my workers what to do each turn, and it's maddening. After doing some research on how to fix the bug, I'm told I have to ""buy the expansions.""

I shouldn't have to spend money to fix a bug."
20015,its fun
20016,"The graphics are great and the gameplay very easy to learn, it is a little repetative between games, but for the most part really interesting."
20017,GG
20018,"my favorite game of all time, much better than the later civ titles"
20019,The game is very interesting and fun.  Excellent graphics and game play

"
20022,Awesome game! Especially cool when setting up the game in advanced settings.
20023,Nah I'm not gonna invade you...
20024,REAL CIV FANS HATE CIV 5 AND 6. THIS IS NOT HOW CIV WAS MEANT TO BE PLAYED
20025,Never knew I could have this much cruelty inside of me
20026,"If you like war and strategy games this is pretty cool.
"
20027,That's a restart from me dog.
20028,Can't play multiplayer between Mac and PC gamers anymore. It's really sucks.
20029,good game
20030,fun game
20031,"Mods make the game, animu wars 4life"
20032,"I initially bought this game after watching a few youtubers (s/o to the yogscast) play this game and the incredible sale that it had going on. I was immensely puzzled at the beginning but after understanding the game, I am in love with it. Would highly recommend this game to anyone!"
20033,"It's the type of game where you look at your clock and see 9:42 PM, tell yourself you'll play just a couple more turns before bed, and then looking at the clock again and see it's 2:23 AM."
20034,What a game.
20035,not good

20050,war funny
20051,"Time-consuming, so not great for casual play, but an excellent use of money for entertainment!"
20052,"I may not have much time on this game, but i love it. For all the content that is here, i believe that it comes at a very good price. I came from Civ 6 on console, with all the DLC, and i believe that this game is equally good (so far, i have only played and finished one game). Also, i have found that there is plenty more content on the steam workshop, and the modding community is great! 9/10! I also have most of the dlc for this game."
20053,I cannot use slaves to build my empire
20054,great game with historical figures. can play this game for hours on my days off work
20055,"Sid Meier's Civilization franchise is one of the greatest gaming series ever made. It is complex, exciting, and every game brings untold possibilities. Multiplayer mode is very fun."
20056,balls

20063,"JUST ONE MORE TURN....

This game is a grate strategy game, especially for all those who love world history, politics and warfare.
Will you be the next Rommel or Gandhi, well why don't you try this game out, do a few runs as different countries, and see what kind of a leader you really are.

One of my personal favorites!

Final Verdict: 9.4 / 10"

20092,It's my favorite game ever. Hands down. I'm still not bored of it and I've been playing for 6 years!
20093,"One of the best 4X games ever made.
I like how they design the achievement system to increase the replayability of the game.
Graphics is absolutely improved since Civ3.
The allocation of cities and their gradual expansion becomes more realistic.
Background music is also good and suits the theme of the current leader.
There are many things in this game awaiting to be explored.
Thank you for making a good game."

20111,Such a classic
20112,better than 6
20113,"The greatest strategy game ever made. I've been playing this game for 10 years now, Civ 3 for even longer. 
The game takes a long time to fully learn however it is well worth the time. From the music, graphics, artwork, research and all that went into the game make it a very full filling game experience. Pair this with Wikipedia as your playing and you will learn so much about the world!!"
20114,Even a potato could run this game
20115,wagewegwgawseg
20116,This is the only game where I can show my true blood lust as I destroy my enemies and crush their wills to fight me.
20117,P sick get some friends n play
20118,"Very fun, especially when playing with friends."
20119,"I have always, always, loved all the Civ games."
20120,"This game is probably the best game I played. It's very interactive, but also very simple to play. So many empires you can play as, as many empires and city-states as you want in a map. There is also local and online multiplayer so you can play with siblings or friends."
20121,im not a fan of this video game
20122,One of my all time favorite games.  I love trying to use different tactics to win each time and hunting for all the specific achievements.  Very time consuming.  I only start this game up if I'm willing to put 4+ hours into it.
20123,gOOD
20124,"The amount of mods and the great amount of other civilizations and options to expand your possibilities and playthroughs make this game easily worth the money, especially if you get it in the all-in-one bundle."
20125,CIV5 is like a box of chocolates.
20126,Fantastic game
20127,it good
20128,its good
20129,FDSGSDFGDG
20130,The loss of cross-play between Mac and PC ruined this game. Dont buy.

20132,it's addictive
20133,Its a good game jk i havent even played
20134,Its okay I guess.

20137,A true classic in civilization franchise.
20138,ITS CIV. EVERYONE LOVES CIV.
20139,Beep Boop
20140,"An excellent empire building strategy game. Highly recommend getting the expansions (both GOT and BNW) as they add the depth that I was missing from the vanilla version.
A wide range of random maps and civilizations provide very good replayability."
20141,"Very first video game i ever played, transformed who i was as a person, sparked my intrest in history. Best purchase of my entire lifetime
"
20142,"So...... 18 Hours, but no single win and lose..........18 hours hever end single game"
20143,Amazing
20144,"Best turned based game ever. been playing since Civ III when i was ten years old with my dad back in 2005, still playing all versions to this date. also made me curious about the actual civilizations represented in the game and sparked my interest in history as a kid."
20145,it is coo
20146,"Great game, easy to learn. A good game to play if you have a lot of time all at once or save and come back. Also easy to play online with friends."
20147,Very engaging. Many options.
20148,banger game
20149,this game likes pussy not dick
20150,GREAT GAME 10/10 will play again
20151,aewfgwefgwesf
20152,Really great game to get into. Very addictive and fairly self explanatory.
20153,The culmination of all CIV games up to this point
20154,"Great game. Unlike Europa Universalis IV or CK2, even better I'd say"
20155,wewgfewg
20156,"Game crashes randpmly on linux, apparently due to multi core issues, just bad design"
20157,no
20158,Lovely Game
20159,banging
20160,"I just forgot to exit the game and went off for vacation...

Highly recommend, nice electricity bills"
20161,"""My people are wearing your blue jeans and listening to your pop music."""
20162,such a good time killer. very good and one of my favourite pc games
20163,.
20164,lmao imagine playing Civ 6
20165,This consumes my life and is absolutely worth the purchase.
20166,"This is the most addicting game I've ever played in my life. I've found myself playing it for 15 hours straight multiple times. Once you get the hang of it, you'll play it forever."
20167,gud game
20168,just fun
20169,"SHITT FUN YO STOP AXIN ME TO REVIEW IT JUST BUY THE SHIT 5 OR 6
"
20170,"can create very diversified games for plenty of replay, and runs quite smoothly despite how crappy my pc is"
20171,good
20172,very easy to get sucked in. Not a perfect game but god it's addicting
20173,no
20174,yes
20175,"Irritatingly bad AI, yet highly addictive game. A solid 4x board game-like strategy title."
20176,"I learned multiple things about world history, as well as real world economy and tactics.
It's a bit scary how real this game is once you get a hang of it.  But it will take a long time
to get a feel.  Watch FilthyRobot's guides.  He's one of if not the best player in the world
that at least speaks English.  I have a lot more fun playing this than playing an RTS like 
Age of Empires.  This is a lot less stressful, but still extremely impactful gameplay and
civilization management."
20177,"Very good, fun gameplay if you like turn based strategy games."
20178,pretty good
20179,yes.
20180,sometimes with mods it just kicks me out of the game.
20181,Just one more turn!!!!!
20182,"Amazing game! I really love playing it over and over again building my own empire! I prefer it over Civ 6. It is one of my favorite games, but for the love of god can Gandhi please stop nuking me?;)"
20183,"I have played various versions over 30 years and by now this game should be perfect or at least brilliant. This latest money grabbing version is lazy, unimaginative and above all UNREALISTIC. The enemy factions diplomacy AI is odd at best and certainly dont behave like people would. Happiness of your empire is heavily affected by population size rather than things like taxes, infrastructure, employment etc. You cannot choose to govern how you like, i.e benevolence or fear. You cannot select real ideologies like communism or capitalism. If your people riot they automatically spawn several of your highest trech units even if you havent built any yourself and they just keep coming until you reduce the happiness level. They have no demands for you to satisfy and you cannot crush the rebellion. Units also often bug out with catapults only able to fire 1 square etc etc. It is frustrating as this game should be perfected but it feels like it was developed relatively recently. How hard is it to replicate reality in a game based on human development after nearly 40 years since the original release. Unfortunately this game is representative of the industry as a whole. Keep releasing ""new"" / slightly worse versions year after year, changing enough to hype up the sales but not actually improving the game or even caring about improving the game"
20184,"If you absolutely, positively need to see every minute of your weekend evaporate..."
20185,Great game to play with friends and hangout.
20186,"I really would recommend this game - it's probably my favourite game in my steam library (at the moment). It is so addictive once you first get it; you rack up 50 then 100 then 200 hours in no time - probably because of how fun & enjoyable it is and how smooth and polished the game feels as a whole but i wouldn't recommend the game without DLC's (most importantly Gods and Kings & Brave new world). And also, as a word of advice to new players; Do not trust Gandhi. EVER!"
20187,I have 979 hours lots of fun
20188,fun game
20189,"Definitely fun and worth its price

+1"
20190,good game!
20191,:)
20192,Fun game!  Lots of strategy to consider.
20193,"It's Civ 5, I wouldn't have even gotten Civ 6 if Civ 5 also had the cool natural disaster system."
20194,"breaking friendships, makes monopoly proud"
20195,gang
20196,"Civ V is a long running, campaign style board game. So first of all, one game lasts numerous hours in case that is relevant to anybody :P
Great game, loads and loads of depth and a high skill ceiling. It always feels fully featured with friends in multiplayer or with CPU players, a mix of the two can make for interesting Diplomatic decisions.
Not a game about graphics but looks absolutely fine with good sound design to match.
The main draw is the strategy, depth, replay value and multiplayer. Recommended on all fronts from me!"
20197,"5000 hours later they want me to rate the game so its good. Can I have free stuff now?
"
20198,“In this sign you will conquer”
20199,"Without that DLC its not full game but with it , its one of the best strategy game which I ever played"
20200,good times.
20201,"Single player is great, and depending on your computer can run really smooth. Multiplayer is a bit slower, especially if you have more players, but is good enough to not be a big problem. Overall really good game mechanics and I often find myself playing for hours at a time."
20202,"YESSIR; you'd better play this game at some point in your life. I will get Ghandi to chase after you with nukes if you don't!!!

PLAY THE GAME ALREADY"
20203,fun game
20204,Brilliant game. The best thing about it is the immense variety of high quality mods available and endless replayability. Highly recommend it.
20205,"you can play as me best bro Bismark and help him receive the queen of englands muff images, god she is beautiful. her body, chest and toes! sculpted by the gods themselves. man what a catch Bismark! Best of luck :)"
20206,slowly ruining my life

20208,"A very indepth game with lots and lots of options/paths for your civ to take. World generation is never the same and although at low level the AI is predictable, the higher levels are a great challenge."
20209,.
20210,good
20211,Gg.
20212,"great game, def. played this then civ 6 but im pretty biased idk
"
20213,I had always meant to play civ since I was younger. I got this game on sale on impulse. I played over a thousand hours in one year. Best Civ.
20214,12 hours of epic moments
20215,"I have got CIV6, but still kinda like 5 better. C6 is not bad, just different...."
20216,Super
20217,GG
20218,great game to kill time
20219,Civilization 5 just might me my favorite game of all time. It's adaptable..its fun...its addictive...This game is still going strong till this day. The No quit community is a great place on steam where a community for gamers are still expanding the game.
20220,"waste of time, DO NOT fall for this trap!"
20221,"Sooo much fun
"
20222,"What more can I say that countless others haven't said before? If you like 4x, grand strategy games, you can't go wrong with Civ V."
20223,"This game is great, i would recommend it to friends and family--- thanks Sid!"
20224,"Recommendation Level 8/10

I enjoy playing this game solo or during LAN parties with my friend. My friend hated me for 3-4 years and started calling me a “Warmonger” due to this game. The only thing I do not like about this game however is that when you are in game, time in the real world goes by 5x quicker. I would absolutely recommend this game! 

Pros +
Great with “Friends”
Graphics are good
Smooth UI
Lots of faction choices

Cons –
Time goes by fast
Gandhi loves Nukes
LAN party games never get finished"
20225,k
20226,i like game yes :D
20227,I love this game
20228,I recommend this game to people with the time to get addicted to a game.
20229,its ok
20230,I've definitely gotten my money's worth.
20231,hours of entertainment. It feels like i'm building a viable civilization. Civ II is still my favorite.
20232,not as good as eu4 though
20233,"I've never really played any civ games much. But I enjoy this game!

Just a note though it's really complex. I'm sure that's normal for civ, but there's a lot of stats, win conditions, how the AI act, and things like that to learn. I'm still learning 45 hours in."
20234,good game
20235,Way better than Civ 6.
20236,"I love the long term planning, and the variety of controllable factors, including fan made addons, or even randomization... can keep this game ever changing."
20237,"The game itself is legendary and was great at launch.  Singleplayer is still good.

Multiplayer is characterized by ragequitters so theres really no point in doing MP unless you have a steamgroup to play with."
20238,"better than 6, ok game"
20239,"It's a lot of fun, a lot of strategy involved, and you learn a little about history (if you're interested). Would recommend to anyone who'd like something that will keep them busy for a long time (1000 hours)."
20240,"fun
"
20241,It's highly addictive
20242,Awesome
20243,"A fun and chill game. Small learning curve to win if you're new to Civ, but overall lots of fun."
20244,stole 500 hours of my life. I guess I like it
20245,Very cool game. At 85% achievements has been a wild ride and ready for when i hit 100%. Awesome game.
20246,I said 1 more turn at 9pm... only to find out that it's 9am the next day and I have been nuked my Gandhi for being too nice.
20247,good
20248,Amazing game for people who like to be strategic. 10/10
20249,"Playing as Egypt on Emperor, Epic speed, Pangea
Turn 42: Great library has been built in far away land with mine at 2 turns left
Turn 48: Assyria declare war on me ""Your land looks like a good addition to my own""
(13 Turn of struggle 2 of my composite bowman and a swordman vs 20 unit which came out of nowhere)
Turn 61: Washington declared war on me ""I need more living space for my empire""
(2 on 1 war continue for a while and both of my bow man get to level 8 for desperately shooting from my cities)
Turn 94: Somehow manage to push both side back but Assyria ask me for every GPT and luxury I have for peace (NO!)
Turn 120: Built a sizable army with 2 catapult and some high level crossbowmen, swordmen
Turn 152: Managed to capture Boston and New York from Washington as puppet
Turn 153-160 : Every civ start to denounce me then declare war on me one by one because of warmonger accusation
Turn 247 : My last city Memphis is fallen after doing my best to fight against literally 100 of renaissance and industrial era unit which AI somehow get them out of nowhere with my crossbow man and galleass stack in city
(Managed to get crossbowman with 3 drill, 3 shock, logistic, range, march and 2 cover I call that my win I guess) 

That civ 5 for me would like to recommend it

20254,Best way to play Civ 5: Vox Populi + InfoAddict
20255,really fun game i recomend this game to everyone that love strategy games.
20256,One... more... turn...
20257,"A great version of Civ' series, with a new fighting system : numbers of units matter less, good tactics matter more.
Beware, it's addictive !"
20258,Really immersive addicting game. Easy to lose track of time while playing.
20259,Fun game to play if you really like the idea of controlling a nation and provides opportunity to win in a variety of ways. Really fun to play with a group of friends and see who can conquer everyone!
20260,"Great turn based strategy game, I prefer the animation on this game over that of other Civ games."
20261,Fun with friends
20262,good
20263,good game
20264,I am always reverting to Civ V from VI. I find the latter somewhat tedious and dislike some of the graphics.
20265,"Addictive, I have phases where I play exclusively one game for weeks on end, and this is one that comes up in the rotation the hardest."
20266,"I now know what it means when 2 hours pass after telling yourself ""Just one more turn"""
20267,can play this for hours straight
20268,"Pretty fun, just try not to lose your life to this game. If you find yourself saying ""just one more turn"" It's too late"
20269,Just... one... more... turn....
20270,great time killer
20271,Forget Civilization 6 this game is the best in series. Even after several years I still play it all the time.

20274,it is just a fun game to play
20275,"Fun game

20276,Fun game - Great for people who like building and adventure
20277,"Every game in different, infinitely replayable"
20278,hi
20279,There are worse ways to get into the strategy genre.
20280,47 year old dad with the lamest of tastes. But I love this game.
20281,Unlimited re-playability makes this game just the best. over 110 hours played and still finding new ways to beat it.
20282,it just works
20283,"A smart, well balanced game that can suck up hours of your time if you're not careful. The fact that there are a multitude of victory options is very creative."
20284,10/10
20285,"fun tactic and political  game
"
20286,"Didn't know i should've been building buildings. By the time everyone else i was playing with had nuclear weapons i was still trying to find iron. I was -35 in debt every turn. In short, fantastic game had a great time."
20287,Best  Civ ever
20288,love this game
20289,So many different options to play this game.  Right now my favorite is Hot Seat games with my children.
20290,super dope. someone should make something like genesis of empires 2 but take some ideas from this game.
20291,Good game!
20292,Still plenty of replay value.
20293,Superb 5*
20294,Amazing game
20295,"good. is good
"
20296,"This is a fantastic turn-taking strategy game, which has been a life-saver during this quarantine period. I didn't think I would enjoy it as much as I do - I'm hooked!"
20297,Good Shit
20298,This is an amazing addictive game which is recommended only if you have enough time to play ;)
20299,"Easy to understand, addictive to play, long as fuk. defenitly get when on sale"
20300,"A well thought out, balanced and intellectually challenging 4X implementation."

20306,I miss playin this with tha bois
20307,"Jogo educativo
Divertido
Estimula a inteligência e o raciocínio lógico"
20308,"Not a good game. Not fun. It really could be played as an Excel sheet. Just tapping some units up, and that's it. The game is not at all a strategy game, nor a battle game.

EDIT: WORST GAME EVER... WASTE OF TIME. BORING AND NO TACTICAL / ACTION / EXCITEMENT."
20309,Very addictive!
20310,gouda game
20311,"Addicting game that you don't even realize how much time has passed. I highly recommend watching AngryJoe review of this game, if considering buying. His review and play through helped a lot in deciding to buy it or not."
20312,"It's a really enjoyable, multifaceted, strategy game that all levels of strategy game players can enjoy. The only real drawback to the game is that each game is rather time consuming."
20313,Favorite in the series!
20314,Great game
20315,"Civ4 is better, Civ 6 is better but still fun"
20316,This game is action packed with or without friends.
20317,"Good, Much better than VI"
20318,is a good game
20319,Good
20320,My brain is to small to play this game... im not kidding :(
20321,Fun!
20322,"Until this piece of garbage works seamlessly on a MAC, their will be no positive recommendations from me on this game."
20323,"This is a fantastic game, but without fail, it will always crash once you get to an advanced part of the game. It is absolutely infuriating, and as a long time player, I will likely never play this game ever again as a result of this glitch. Unless the game maker makes a concerted effort to reach out / fix these problems, they are likely to lose more and more users (clients)."
20324,The best CIV
20325,good
20326,it's not cringe
20327,"meh
"
20328,fucking fantastic

20355,"It takes a while to learn how to best build your cities to keep your citizens happy, but it is very interesting."
20356,best game ever!!!!!
20357,It's good....
20358,"Best Civilization Concept of the series...it has better AI and more mature feel to it than that cartoonish Civ 6.  It is also more challenging...Civ 6 is more of a ""everyone wins"" type of feel to it."
20359,it's fine.
20360,Me Gusta
20361,u gotta cop the expansions or u played yaself
20362,I guess I've played it a little.

20375,Lack of beans
20376,"This game is bloody brilliant, I have played over 500hrs and the replayablility is amazing. I come back to this game time and time again"
20377,Have played Civ 5 & 6 -- they both have their pros and cons.  Bottom-line is that both of them are great turn based strategy games.  They make you really think and plan ahead.  I highly recommend them both.
20378,gay
20379,this is amazing
20380,123
20381,"brilliant game, enjoy every second. Much better than civ 6"
20382,Great game.  Very addictive.

20384,very hard but fun to play if you get the hang of it
20385,Great strategy game with no goofy animations.
20386,"played it for only a few hours, 10/10 though"
20387,"Arguably the best Civilization game that had been made! Though I personally also like Civ VI. Absolutly worth the buy. Had issues with glitches here and there, but not nearly often enough to make me stop playing this classic.

20388,"Fun gay, can play it for hours. Every game is different."
20389,"Classic.  After about 700 hours of gameplay, optimization gets a bit boring, but switching up modes and playing multiplayer is always good.  5/5, the best civ game there is especially with expansions."
20390,great evolution of the game

We need to hurry up and nuke ourselves back to stone age 6 more time to catch up with this series"

20398,its great
20399,"Games take a long time as everyone knows, but once you start to get properly assessed with the game's mechanics and can eke out a win, the feeling is great. Every win and loss feels impactful, drawing you to play another game, and finish another turn."
20400,time travel simulator at it's best
20401,This is much more fun to play than Civ VI which I also own.  Civ V is by far my favorite game.
20402,My favorite game of all time
20403,Better than CIV6 lol

20416,"If you ever want to see a war thirsty Gandhi or diplomatic Genghis Khan and Attila, This game is for you."
20417,I just love this game.
20418,Best of the Civ games. Perfect balance.
20419,"An excellent game that never gets old. 
Easy to understand and play while it takes some time to master, but it's not boring or frustrating to do it.
Replayability is one of the greatest qualities of this game. 
The graphics still beautiful (colorful but not childish), great soundtrack, well written and has a stable performance even with mods.
One of the best things about this game, in my opinion, is the voice acting. It's simply amazing.
Civ 6 is nice, but Civ 5 is way better and more enjoyable.

20425,gud
20426,this game hurts the mind. it lead to me getting mental assistance.
20427,"Perfectly balanced, as all things should be.

For approx. £8 on G2A you can get all the expansions... insane value for money."
20428,"Awesome game. It's my entry point to the Civ franchise and I must say I understand how addictive is this ""one more turn"" thing they created. Strong stuff."
20429,after playing it for 5 hours straight i recommend good strategy game to fuck your friends over on
20430,"Best civ game still. Do yourself a favor, ignore the trash game Civ 6. The AI is a joke. And buy this game and install Vox populi which is a mod years in the making that overhauls the game entirely making it the best of the best Civilization games."
20431,"If you like moving around little tank-shaped graphics and rolling over AI with them, dropping nukes to wipe out every other country's cities and using stealth bombers to rain death on the entire planet from your capital then this game is for you. If you want depth, some semblance of realism or the need for thorough tactics, go play a paradox game"
20432,yes

20441,Love Civ games.
20442,"One of my favorite games ever.  Played Civ 4 at a young age and loved it.  Played this later on and really found a new appreciation for the elegance of it all.  Would highly recommend to any RTS player or history nerd with an inclination for gaming.  But ultimately, I would recommend this game to anyone who was willing to try it.  It's great."
20443,game good. play.
20444,Its good.
20445,I have played this game for over 400 hours and it still keeps me engaged.  I would recommend this game to anyone who is looking for a version of Civilization to play.
20446,"Best Civ, get dlc"
20447,"Good game. Kinda glitchy though, especially on multiplayer."
20448,good

20452,Only negative I have except how mulitplayer games can easily stall because someone hasn't clicked the next turn button is how easy this game will empower your nationalism. Use with caution.
20453,buy if you have no life
20454,game gud
20455,"Civilization V is the pinnacle of what this series has to offer. This game is ""Settlers of Catan"" with tons more features and settlers to work with. It's a strategy game that manages to also capture one's creative ambitions, because you can do anything you want, really,,AND there's payoff for doing so. 
Visually, it's neither too flashy or drab. For a somewhat old title, it holds up quite well, even now. Its modding community is fantastic, with a variety of additions that can spice up gameplay or hinder the player.  Either way, it's fun alone or with friends. I highly recommend this title, and would encourage you to buy it; DLC included."
20456,It's really long but very detail orientated.
20457,Damm son this is good.
20458,fun
20459,I have played over 88 hours of this game and trust me i had sooo much fun. It is not a hard to understand and it had a simple yet sleek interface
20460,I've played the game for 1500 hours... Why would I ever play a game i didn't like for that long? Come on steam use your brain. OF COURSE I LIKE THIS GAME.

20473,"Please help me, I got this game and can't stop playing wtf"
20474,Love it
20475,"I've been playing Civ games since CivNet. Though some may argue they are progressively oversimplified, Civ V offers fantastic gameplay and is a worthy addition to the series of 'just one more turn...'. It is difficult to return to Civ IV after playing this one."
20476,This game just fun
20477,Grab the whole collection on sale for 12 bucks. Holds up extremely well years after I first bought it and it's a fun timewaster with friends.
20478,"One of the best games I ever played. I have spent so many hours on this and will probably spend many many more. Well worth the price to get all the dlc that comes with it too,"

20486,"600 hours already?! God, why is this game so addictive? I swear I made a sandwich and went showering somewhere in between but on the other hand I spent way to much time leading my civilization into utopia only to be blown to kingdom come by Gandhi's nuclear mania. Everyone's out for war while I just want to do arts and crafts. Can recommend if you like to be stressed out over who gets to build Stonehenge first as much as I do."

Civ 5 is like if history had a videogame"
20495,Of all the Civ games this one is my favorite!

20522,Amazing game!

Even the base game with DLCs is enjoyable, it looks good and plays good.

20539,creative game
20540,ONE. MORE. TURN..
20541,Very captivating
20542,its a fun TBS game and it has a lot to give. But i would of liked to see the space part of the game with out a add-on or anything. But all in all i think its a grate game.
20543,Easily the greatest strategy game of the decade a true masterpiece

20557,It is THE game for a healty brain!
20558,tried to play one match and it went longer than a day. just missed the 2 hour refund window by a bit.
20559,"I've played more than 115 hours WITHOUT workshop mods. I can probably play 1000 more hours.
But for the complete experience you must have the two (not very cheap but definitely worth the prices) expensions since the best mods rely on them (and even when not playing with mods)."
20560,don't buy VI lol

20566,Awesome game!
20567,Best played when you have a couple days of free time.
20568,nice
20569,"An awesome game, the first empire strategy game I've ever played where I was genuinely worried about my empire."
20570,really wonderful game. I  would say if you are new to the series you should get Civ IV and once you have the game down graduate to this game. If you are experienced with the Civ series Civ VI is a better deal for you considering the game is a newer title
20571,"You can rename your cities and religion to ""fart center""

20587,Great game
20588,"The Civilization series hasn't improved in twenty years.  It has gotten more complex, sure, with more features and more detailed graphics.  Yet, no matter how high the numbers tacked onto the end of the title are getting the game play still consists of the same tired core mechanics as the first Civ titles in the early 90's, and those mechanics are showing their age badly.  

Unless you are a die hard Sid Meyer's fanatic running on a pure nostalgia trip i would give this game a pass.  There are newer games that do this genre far better now.

Sid Meyer's Civilization is one franchise that has not withstood the test of time well at all."
20589,it is very fun and also extremely easy to spend like seven hours on without realizing it or getting up to do anything else
20590,Lmao nuke it
20591,Great Game and awesome for a party game.
20592,Greatest civilization game in the series for me
20593,Fun style of take over the world Chess. Even more fun when you have a friend to play with and dominate the world or fight for dominance.
20594,"I have only played the tutorial of this game and still did not finish it in the 5 hours I have played this game thus far. However, I can already tell this game is utterly superb. I am sure I will get sucked in for many an hour more by this game."
20595,"CIV is not your standard shootem up and destroy kinda game. To really be successful requires planning, patience and integrity. Every game has it's place and in the world of simulations this one stands out for its ability to engage you on a lot of levels."
20596,Played for years. Still love it!
20597,no u. its a great game
20598,I've lost control of my life. Please help. There is always one more turn. I'm 2000 hours in.
20599,honestly couldnt get into it
20600,"Game good, better than Civ 6 maybe, but game good."
20601,"Great game. Quite epic in scope, not exactly a casual game but there are easy settings. Careful though, you could easily get sucked into this game and not notice the time fly. If the term ""turn based strategy"" doesn't scare you away you will probably fall in love with this game. Get the expansions too."
20602,Good game. Much fun
20603,It's ok
20604,Good game.
20605,"its fucking civilization. you either like it or you dont at this point, right?"
20606,Is good
20607,good
20608,"Its a fun game. Started playing with my two children and they enjoy it.  It teaches a number of lessons about economy, strategy and relationships.  Great game."
20609,Good And Fun. Makes You Really Think With Stratagy And Political Consept.
20610,"I would declare war on Russia.  Russia would thwart my advances. Russia would offer me a bunch of luxuries and a peace treaty.  I accept and declare war on Russia again.  I proceed to lose battles, Russia gives me St. Petersburg as a peace treaty.  I accept and then wipe them off the globe.  Good Game."
20611,Just Awesome
20612,My hours played speaks for itself
20613,poop
20614,"No cross-platform multiplayer makes this game a bad purchase, and even if you do have the same platform then the multiplayer is still almost unplayably buggy. This means that you end up with a game that you can almost only play solo, but of course there is game-ruining bugs in the single player too. Your milage may vary, but this game has been a nightmare for me.

On the other hand this game is fun when it does work, so buy it if you feel like going on a rollercoaster of computer-melting, insanity-inducing bugs, or a barrel of laughs, depending on how much the gods appreciate the sacrifice of your sanity."
20615,This is a gold standard strategy game.
20616,"Best of the Civ games so far, better then VI in my opinion. Love playing still at night before I fall asleep it’s very relaxing and strategic but much better then the million other games that try and copy it."
20617,Still one of my favorite strategy games of all time!
20618,This is one of my favorite games of all time! I like the style and the different ways you can win or set up your game. This makes it a great fit for a variety of players.
20619,It is goot.
20620,its ok
20621,its a great strategy live combat to add to the effect
20622,"Everything about this game is virtually perfect. The army, the concepts, the cities, the technology, literally everything. If you're bored, do yourself a massive favor and buy this game, and if you're really feeling like having fun, buy the DLC's and expansion packs as well. You will not be disappointed."
20623,Solid game. Still better than VI.
20624,Best game
20625,you will need to find new friends
20626,I have sunk so many hours into this game and still have no idea what i'm doing. 10/10
20627,it's Civ 5.
20628,why is this still better than civ 6
20629,gr8
20630,amazing game
20631,"All in all, Civ 5 is probably the most worthy installment of the franchise since Civ 2 MGE. (My top-rated CIV game.) I can quibble over some minor details but it is a worthy tribute to the early games and also a reasonable expansion based on them. I believe Firaxis could have done better following in the vein of Call to Power as the versions progressed though this surely moved closer in that direction. 

There have been play balance issues with Civ since Sid Meier first coded it so that a Phalanx could defeat a Battleship in DOS-based CIV 1. There was a certain logic to it, however that is not the big issue I find with Civ 5. It's the rare but extant bugs. Nonetheless they are rare. So it's Recommend.  

I've got many hundreds of hours played but not recorded on Steam since I bought it back when CDs were still a thing (and easily thousands more on Civ1/Civ 2 MGE.) Civ 5 stands on its own among a handful of Civ-titled games. Furthermore this game has come lightyears from where it was at release in 2010. DirectX 11 makes it look so so much better! It runs silky smooth on my RX 580 + V-NAND 860 EVO SSD. This is really a work of art and it shows now too.

Once you get past the outright cheating and dumb play-balance and interface aspects of CIV 5 (Emperor-level and above, as is expected,) it is the first game that I can legitimately say in the CIV series that offers realistic mass-unit movements on the AI's part as well as them demonstrating intelligent tactical battle-grouping. Importantly this extends to sea battle-groupings. I'm actually fairly impressed with this feature although it is somewhat muted from the more mundane idiosyncrasies holding it back from being a Call to Power-like masterpiece. It already eclipses it in this one very important area however.

PS The Deluxe scenarios are definitely better, note."
20632,"great game
"
20633,The Best Civ Game
20634,"fuckin rights

20635,"i like the nostalgia and strategy, great game 8/10"
20636,possibly a biased comment but this is the best Civ game.
20637,best civ game by far
20638,"My favorite PC game of all time, and Civ: BE and Civ VI, while both possessing their own charm doesn't match the magic of this game. The passion of the mod community, the design of the game and the value of the DLCs, its still in my opinion the greatest Civ ever made and perhaps one of the greatest games ever made."

20654,The best Civ game. It just needs true multiplayer mod support and better handling of disconnects/reconnects for players with poor internet.

20665,"I have played over 5000 hours of this game it WAS my favourite however, approximately one year ago the game stopped working. Despite my best efforts and , NO SUPPORT FROM STEAM, the game is basically unplayable. Don't waste your money on it and don't ever expect Steam to support its products. It truly is, ""caveat Emptor"" when it comes to Steam products.

GOOD NEWS: After one year of waiting Steam finally publicized a work-around to make the product playable again!! , or perhaps it was Firaxis or 2K. Regardless, approach buying Steam products with caution. On the plus-side, my favourite game is useable at last. Thank you Steam for finally realizing that Customer Support matters.
"
20666,Very tasty game.
20667,I love this game i bought it years ago in college and have changed laptops and lost log in information many times. But every time i download steam I get this game because I can not get enough of it!
20668,"Very nice strategia. Good luck baiting your friends to death,"
20669,"I started a game with a friend for him to show me the game, if you don't have patience for waiting for other people to decide in which of the 10 strategically-identical hexes they will place each their workers on every single turn maybe play this alone. (basically if you are a tryhard more than a timmy).

After my dear friend went to bed I started a game alone, lasted like 9 hours, not sure if enough to rate the game but surely lasted longer than the campaigns of Resident Evil 2/3 Remake.

The game is good, the pacing obviously a bit slow, but the only real annoying part is how damn slow the AI is at calculating their turns, even on a very decent PC. If you are locked out due to corona it's a good time sink, if not maybe give it a pass and play something that isn't going to drain your youth every turn."
20670,"Very disappointing.  I've been a fan of the Civilization games from the beginning and each new game was better than the previous, until now.  The new combat and movement restrictions are just stupid.  Now that you can't stack units, combat is unfair, unbalanced, and overly complicated.  I had a 1 tile passage through  the mountains and a worker was blocking the movement of my general.  Why?  That's not fun, it's just annoying.  This game annoys you to death.  I uninstalled it after an hour of playing. Too bad."
20671,"single player game, not as much concern about public happiness."
20672,"Steam asked me if i liked this game... after playing 781 hours... nah, i don't think i do XD (that was a joke, obviously, it's an awesome game!)"

20678,this is the most epic game i've ever played
20679,"You won't be able to sit down and play ""just one quick match"". At least not that easily. Always something to be done in a race against time to be the nation that prospers among all others. Either it be Domination, Culturally, Diplomatically, or Scientifically. For a turn based-tile strategy game, it was addicting and hooked me right in."

20703,"I got this game two days ago and have 36 hours logged, that says enough."
20704,engaging
20705,Good combination of strategic and tactical.  The same scenario will play out differently each time.  There is a good bit of predictability with the AI personalities.   Really excellent game.
20706,"Fun to Play

""Just one more turn!"""
20707,"This style of game is not my usual. It is ridiculously fun, though.

You are the ruler and you have to make sure your empire thrives against lack of resources, rival empires, barbarians, and even your unruly citizens. No worries, though, because if you can make do with what you've got (plus a little bit of good fortune) you'll create wonders, raise unstoppable armies, bring wealth and fertility to your people, and be respected throughout all the world.

Even the most astute ruler has their advisors at hand to consult on matters of the nation's development. In Civ V, looking ahead is an advantage like none other. Whether it involves trade, agriculture, defense, or education, what you plan for today is the foundation of what you will become in the next era. The wise ruler can predict the bounty offered by the land and choose the technologies and policies required to flourish with great advantage over rivals.

Each of the empires come with their own unique specialty units and structures depending on the technologies and current era of your game along with their own unique perk that is empire-specific which allows for unmatched advantages in niche situations. This means you can devise strategies based off of your special abilities that can help you to either take advantage of situations or perhaps squeak out of some dire moments. Learning of your strengths is rewarding in and of itself, but testing your abilities against opponents is a joy of its own caliber.

I recommend playing on every difficulty setting so that you really get a feel for how much strategy can go into playing this game. Pay close attention to where your units can and cannot go and why. Consider the things you might want to have three or four turns away. Go through the technology tree and see how the map relates to your options. Commit to playing the game with curiosity before playing to dominate. There are many different game settings and a wealth of information in the games encyclopedia or in-game charts. Dare to dream of the greatest empire in the world.

Oh, and don't sweat mistakes because you can save your progress at any time before you commit to something; you also have automatic saves you can mess around with.

Try this game. Learn this game. You will probably like this game. It's not well received for nothing."

20710,"This is a great strategy game and a great starting game if you want to get into the civ series. It's not as bloated as Civ VI and more user friendly than Civ IV. The diplomacy options, while simple, allow you to pull off some amazing things. AI's not the best with military tactics, often times just rushing your nearest city with their entire force. The game stops you from just steam-rolling them though. A great game, and a relaxing way to spend an afternoon."
20711,I have no idea what's going on

I can't tell you how many hours I've spent relaxing and enjoy the heck out of this one. If you like a challenge, logistics and management style games .... I highly recommend this one."

20736,"BEST CIV GAME HANDS DOWN

realistic feel that takes you on a grand adventure, isn't that what we want from a game?

il play this one for a long time."
20737,"During Covid quarantine, this game helped save my marriage. We were able to sit down over the long distances while we had to live apart, and talk about what was going on and make actual conversation. This game can move at a slow to moderate pace without worrying about being in a group, guild or team. There were times when we were yelling at eachother but in the end it was all good fun. The game is relaxing and so long as you dont mind a few odd cities or AI that can be a bit wonky then you could enjoy it as well. Hours of play is the norm. Learning how different societies can work and makes you think what you want to do next, set up a new city, create some new workers or troops, even think about how to earn the most gold or culture points. Strategy is needed and for those who wish for a challenge, throw in a few friends."

20752,"If you're trying to get a 3.00gpa or higher, or you're a post-grad student, this game is not for you.  You may say to yourself, ""oh, I'll only play for an hour or two then get back to my life.""  But then you find yourself saying, ""Just one more turn.""   One more turn is the equivalent to 6-8 hours of gameplay...

11/10 would ruin medical school for just one more turn."

20772,fun
20773,Great game for those who like long term strategy games.
20774,"Coming from Civ IV beyond the sword, I'm really disappointed that all the spying and religion system have not been kept in the original version. They're in the add-ons? great... how to pay twice for the same game... The highest scores are also just too easy to reach imo, should not even be possible in warlords mode... Also it's really slow: why do you need to stay on a unit for 10s after it's finished its action? The display of the score and opponents status, as well as foreign relations report in general is a huge step backwards compare to CIV-IV -> why isn't there any graph that shows the relation of the opponents with each other??? Isn't it an important point of diplomacy? Or maybe it's also in the add-ons?

Ok let me go to the plus side: the combat system is reaaally a nice improvement: the impossibility of stacking units adds soo much to the tactical possibilities + the difference between range units and contact ones + the self defense abilities of cities. Also I'm kindof happy that the advisers are back, although after 20 years, they still haven't managed to get close to the coolness of the Civ-II ones, not even a tiny little bit."
20775,"Great game, especially for a few people playing hotseat in one house. I didn't play these types of games before but it's quite easy to pick up how to the play the game"
20776,"Better than civ 6
Fuck civ 6"
20777,"More addictive than crack cocaine. Approach with caution. Incredibly perfect, 11/10 game that you'll not stop playing. I haven't slept in 41 hours, been too busy playing Civ 5."

Graphics and gameplay are better, of course, and there's so much more you can do in this one than, say, the first one. But, again, Civ has never been a disappointment. If you love strategy, you'll love this game."

"
20790,it be fun
20791,"To be honest, I did not expect to find another game where I would spend 1000+ hours, let alone, that it would be strategy game. Civilization V is a great and I would say balanced game, even though I have zero experience in Multiplayer mode, but I had many games on higher difficulties offline against AI and with confidence can say that I can hold my ground. 

You build your civilization from scratch, starting in Ancient Era with a single Settler who will found your very first city and a unit of Warriors who will defend it from rampaging Barbarians and explore surroundings to potentially speed up your development. Every aspect in the game is almost equally important and a lack of either of them may greatly hamper your progress towards healthy development of civilization. That's where interaction with other Civilizations come in. You may trade for resources, unite against other civilizations or backstab them for your own benefit. One of my favourite things about this game is that you don't have to necessarily aim to destroy other civilizations to win, even though wars in this game is another one of my most favourite mechanics. You can peacefully mind your own business, and develop your culture or science to win Cultural or Science victories or accumulate enough allies with City-States to elect yourself as a World Leader which will lead you to Diplomatic Victory. Your actions have direct impact on other civilizations attitude towards you, and the more your goals align with other civilizations, the more friendly they are to you, and vice versa.

The game is very addicting. Depending on the settings, a single session may take 6+ hours, which explains why I played it so much. If you plan to get it, get both Gods and Kings and Brave New World expansions, because without these, it's whole another game. There is just to much to tell about this game, just buy and you won't regret it. 10/10"
20792,nice.
20793,banging game
20794,is good game
20795,"This is on of the few games you can revisit over and over. Never having the same experience. I sometime had months between play sessions and found myself diving right back into it. Be it alone or with friend, this is a gem."

20848,the tits are unparalleled
20849,"I've played all of the Civ games since Civ 2 (including Civ 6) and this is far and away my current favorite.  Civ 2 will always be number 1 in my heart but honestly, if I'm going to sit down and play a game of Civ, it's going to be Civ 5."
20850,"Highly recommend. Civ 5 was my introduction to civ games and strategy games in general. 

I quickly fell victim to the ""just one more turn"" curse. Many nights I have stayed up till 4 a.m. and telling myself I would just save and quit after I finished constructing a building or wonder or whatever it may be...

My biggest gripe with the vanilla game is that there are very obvious policy choices that reign supreme over others. The game forces you into a tall empire. You can fix these issues with mods (NQmod, Lekmod) but these are designed mainly for online play and not single-player. The AI suffers. 

Regardless, I love the game and don't mind trying to hardest to make a liberty civ work for me. Sometimes I get a great spawn and I can grab on to just enough happiness until I can build some wonders and grab more lux resources from city-states and other civs.

If you are debating between Civ 5 or Civ 6, just know they are two entirely different games. Experience both for yourself and see what you think. You'll never know until you try.

Enjoy the game!"

20863,Best game ever; to put it simply.
20864,"It's great. I mean it's Civ5, at this point you should know from all the lets play videos about it."
20865,"One of the best turn based multiplayer games on the market. Whether you want to be a socialist authoritarian or a ruthless dictator, this game is for you. You can command a large army or invest your hard earned money and time into science, creating endless advancements to your civilization. Or go for a more political strategy, convincing other societies to like you, increasing your like-ability as your size increases. The replay-ability is endless and the times shared with friends or alone are unforgettable."

20880,"A strictly multiplayer game! And even then not just for any party.
It is about a balanced game if the aggressor is about 30% better player. 

Why negative review? The regression of AI is just too severe. The only fight you get is fighting unhappiness. 
I guess challenging AI went down to the toilet after they ended unit stacking. AI is just not able to keep up with a human brain. 

If you come like me: Civ 1-2-3-4-->5, you get no challenge whatsoever."

20894,I enjoy the creativity and strategic thinking that goes into ensuring your Civilization keeps pace -and ideally outpaces- other competitive AI players.

Turns out I do and it's great with both single and multiplayer. Just purchased the DLC for Civ-V and will add Civ VI and its DLC to my wish list so when they go on sale I can purchase them.

20951,"I'm pretty sure this is my first Steam review. For a decade now, I've continued to come back to Civ V for weeks at a time. No other game has hooked me quite like this game. It's not too difficult to pick up. and yet, after ~750 hours, I continue to learn new interactions and fine tune strategies, and it remains as interesting as ever. The more I learn about the game, and the better I get at it, the more I enjoy it. I've tried Civ VI, and I probably haven't given it enough of a chance because I was turned off by the art direction, but honestly, I consider Civ V with BNW to be perfection so what's the point. I plan to teach my kids to play when they get a little older, and I will probably still be playing this game as an old man. Brilliant work from Firaxis."

Honestly I really enjoy CIV 5 even though I know very little about what I’m doing. I know how to play the game and pretty well but then again I’ll be sending musket men at my friend with X-Com squads. Which brings me to my next point, playing this game with friends is how I play it and how I recommend you play it until you’ve got a good grip on the methods and functionality of progressing your civ in a reasonable time. The graphics for this game are actually very good and it’s pretty good at making your friends not talk to you for the rest of the night.

I highly recommend CIV 5 to everyone."

I have played both civ 5 and civ 6, so if you are here to decide if you want to get the 5th or 6th, get this one.

21034,"Yes, a little dumbed-down in relation to Civ IV, but still find myself returning to it to try to build a random civ, always with a plan in mind that always go awry. The colors, the music and the ambiance, I think, have rooted themselves in the pleasure-centers of my brain; as fun (despite random-mood swings from the AI) as this game can be, it is one of the most dangerous time-sucks: it's easy to go in thinking you'll only click for a few turns or build a unit or monument and then look up and it's been 8hrs...( or 808 hrs and counting..yeesh) And I still don't think I'm very good at it. Haven't even attempted online play: I know I'm bad, don't need real humans rubbing that in my face."

21041,"Very nice game with enough options to not get bored. Singleplayer is fun for trying out all types of strategies and civs, but the best thing is when you play with your friends. It brings a whole new dynamic.
There is 1 bug that makes you skip 1 turn  in multiplayer games when you reload it. This is very annoying because everytime you continue a game you will lose 1 turn, which can be vital in the middle of war."

21051,"It's Civ V.  It's the gold standard of both the series and the genre.  You should already have it, and if you were thinking about buying it, you should probably do so already.  It's a tremendous game, not too unwieldy, and is a blast to play.  You may never stop playing it, in fact.  You may also play it for so long that you might forget to eat, use the bathroom, breathe, talk to your spouse and/or children, or go to work."
21052,really long but fun

My only minor qualms are with the netcode for multiplayer, and the absurdly slow air attack animations (seriously, who tf decided to make it 5 seconds long)."

21108,"Better than Civilization 6, better than Civilization Beyond Earth (though that game is underrated), in fact its better than every other Civilization game. Did I mention its also probably one of the top 5 strategy games you can get right now? 

Tired of the base game? Try out thousands of mods."
21109,It's good.
21110,"Coming from Civ 6. Tried to in the past get into Civ 5 but never really did, mostly because I didn’t know what the hell I was doing. But made the effort and completely got sucked into CIV 6 and have beat it on Deity level so thought I’d come back to CIV 5 and see if I could use some of my Civ 6 skills on it. 

I went to war in Civ 5 and then got denounced by absolutely everybody. Don’t really understand why, as at least in Civ 6 war is a big part of the game and a victory condition and you don’t get denounced like that. However, even though everybody was against me, I used a Great General to create a Citadel in a choke point, which gave my unit in it an overpowered 100% defensive bonus and all enemies that end their turn next to it a 30 damage per turn penalty. You do have Forts in Civ 6 but not as powerful as this Citadel thing and all the Civs kept sending troops towards me and I just kept killing them. But when I tried to progress past my Citadel I would get destroyed and my happiness levels were so bad I couldn't do much and it just became a stalemate. In the end I just decided to go back to Civ 6.

A few other things that I noticed to compare both games:

PRESENTATION

Definitely prefer the art in Civ 5. It’s far more realistic and clean and not so ridiculously colorful and cartoonish as Civ 6.  However, the animations in Civ 5 when discovering a natural wonder or building a wonder are nowhere near as good as Civ 6, being that they don’t even exist in Civ 5 and it’s a big anticlimax coming from Civ 6. Also the animations of the Civs in CIV 6 definitely feel more life-like with all their heightened expressions and the details of the city districts, making the game feel more alive.

UI is greatly improved in Civ 6. Very intuitive and the city bars give you quick views of important information and overall much more information available at a glance and with hovering. Great how in CIV 6 all victory types have different tabs to give you the details on how you are progressing. There are far more analytics and much needed transparency to help one understand what is going on, clearly being able to see now why other Civs might be happy or pissed off with you and what steps you can take to change that. It is mostly this area why I think I was finally able to get into the Civ franchise. Coming back to Civ 5, so much information is just missing and even though I know what is going on now because of playing Civ 6, I can understand why newcomers would struggle with Civ 5.   

Music is stunning in CIV 6! It’s dynamic, changing when meeting new CIVs and overall Friaxis have raised the bar vs CIV 5 in this area. However, really like CIV 5’s classical music throughout the game and think it’s one of the reasons CIV 5 gives a more calming playthrough. Sound effects with animals in CIV 5 are very comforting and I don’t notice those sounds in CIV 6.  

Big fan of Sean Bean as narrator in CIV 6. However, love the more calming voice of whoever is narrating in Civ 5. I also prefer the quotes more when you have researched something in Civ 5, with there just being some strange and not always inspiring quotes in Civ 6.  

GAMEPLAY

There seems to be balance issues with happiness in Civ 5. In CIV 6 each luxury resource will give up to 4 cities 1 amenity (the new happiness mechanic). In CIV 5 each luxury resource gives you 4 happiness. But each city you have cost 4 happiness. So instead of being able to comfortably have 4 cities on one resource, CIV 5 you will only be comfortable having one city for one resource. This greatly slows down the game, especially if going for a domination victory. CIV 6 also introduced the loyalty system connected with city expansion, which works brilliantly, is far more realistic and offers a whole new level of strategy to the game.

CIV 5 overall is a much slower game and it’s obvious that the developers set out to speed the game up in CIV 6. CIV 6 builders have charges and instantly build. The Eureka and Inspirations of CIV 6 greatly speeds one movement down the Tech tree and in CIV 6, new Civics tree, which to me works much better than CIV 5 policy tree. However, sometimes you want to work towards a wonder and it can be confusing to know which tree you find it in. Civ 6 you can also have research agreements to speed up tech knowledge but in Civ 5 the mechanic is slower and lacks the transparency of the mechanics in CIV 6. You don’t have to waste time building roads in Civ 6 because your trade routes automatically do that.

The Great Person mechanic is far superior in CIV 6, letting you see who you actually can recruit, and passing up if you don’t want that particular unique great person buff. Spy system is much more polished in CIV 6.   

It’s unclear in CIV 5 how the food surplus contributes to city growth. With CIV 6, as long as you have just one food surplus your city will grow and it’s not sped up by having more food surplus. Civ 6 has new mechanics of growth based on the combination of housing, amenities and loyalty. It’s not necessarily a better system in that area and can be just as confusing.  

There is a new Era Score in Civ 6 and historical moments which shows how your empire is growing. Golden ages in Civ 5 just seem to happen but in Civ 6 you are always trying to improve your score to get the golden age and not fall into a dark age which hurts your loyalty. Added to this, Inspirations popping up and Eurekas feels like there is always something happening and when in CIV V it feels like there are a lot more dead spots. However, these make Civ 6 feel more hectic and you lose that calmness feeling as you get in Civ 5. I think I would prefer not to constantly have pop up eurekas and inspiration moments.   I also prefer in Civ 5 how everybody enters their own age when they progress, unlike in Civ 6 with everybody entering the same age together.

Having all your buildings in the City for Civ 5 is cleaner but Districts and city planning ups the game in Civ 6. You now have a mini city builder game and all the strategy that comes with that.

In Civ 6 you accumulate strategic resources, which works much better than in Civ 5.
 
Diplomacy and grievance system in Civ 6 offers much more transparency and potential for deeper strategy. 

The envoy and suzerian system in Civ 6 is a big plus for interacting with City States. Now you don’t have to think about wasting money for an always diminishing influence. And I like how once you put the envoy in you can’t get it back. It’s like pushing that pond on the chess board forward, knowing you can’t retreat it. 

Religion is more dynamic in Civ 6, with theological combat and it being separate from diplomacy.

In Civ 6 it’s so much easier to see what era units are from when you hover over them, to what they upgrade to or what units have an upgrade to them. Getting rid of unit  clutter by having builder units expire after they use up their limited builder charges and being able to combine units to make a more powerful unit is a nice improvement. Units heal when they get promoted in Civ 6 so you don’t have to waste a promotion just to heal. 
  
Government Policy Cards are brilliant in Civ 6! It’s like you are playing  a deck builder  game with different powers to your cards. Adds a whole other strategy mechanic to the game and  let’s one customise their gameplay like never before in a  Civ game. It’s difficult to play Civ V and leave this mechanic behind. 

VERDICT

Civ 6 has proven to me it deserves to replace its predecessor. But it was able to build from the shoulders of the giant Civ V. For it’s time period, it was and still is a good game. 7/10 - Good"
21111,Its a very fun and difficult game. And you might learn a thing or two while playing.

21137,"First thing to say before I write this review is that I have played more Civ IV than Civ V, and my hours are a reflection of my habit of leaving the game on, running, for weeks at a time. In spite of having played more Civ IV than Civ V, and only have seen my wife play Civ VI, I can summarize Civ V as such: it is the best game in the Civilization series. 

This, as those of us playing for all these years know, was not a given. On release, Civ V was the very worst installment of Civ, for reasons that no longer matter after two extraordinary expansions. If you're going to buy Civ V, buy everything - the expansions and the DLC. At the very least, you MUST buy the two expansions. The game mechanics are completely different from original to Gods & Kings. And Brave New World is a master class expansion. 

At any rate, if you like sims, this is one of the best games out there. The pros? Simply a fabulous game. The cons? Even to this day it is a memory hog, and it feels like my computer groans when it plays this oldie. Newer PCs don't need to worry. But older computers - even though this game came out in the 2010 - will still feel the pressure on processing. Computer turns will take ages in the later eras of the game.  So if you're thinking ""oh, my laptop is from 2015, I can run this!"", yes, you can, and you'll be surprised at the slowdown.

Anyway, if you're looking to get into Civ and Civ VI looks daunting from the initial reviews (Civ games since IV have changed a lot each expansion), then grabbing this plus the expansion (and optimally, the DLC) is the best place to start. Not a hard Civ to learn, and the higher difficulties are withering. I've only beaten up to 6/8 difficulty myself. 

So, yeah. Civilization V is awesome. It was terrible on release a decade ago, and today it's the best Civ. Take it home, kids."
21138,"I hate this game, total waste of time."
21139,Its good!
21140,"Tried them all - this one is head & shoulders above the others - later versions just add complication and earlier versions are missing finesse - Civ V is the perfect game - relaxing, enjoyable and with infinite control on game set up."
21141,"The game is a fun strategy set up with many nations to choose from. It is very enjoyable, and still has many people who play it, even though it is an old game. It does not require a good graphics card, and is easy to run."
21142,Way too addictive for its own good!
21143,great game
21144,Lots of hours of play ahead!!
21145,pretty fun once you get the hang of it
21146,"this game is awesome and addictive!  The management and strategy are perfect. This is also a better version that Civ 6, which is too complicated and a bit campy and unrealistic.  give it a try!"
21147,"a roller coaster of emotions, caused 2 of my bestfriends of 11 years to fall out. some bird me mates poggin was PYAAA giving it the big ones cos me n my guy matty went to war with her, an her fella was pure geggin in cos she knew she was gonna get absolutely polaxed. 11/10 would recommend if your rapid at taking turns n tha"
21148,The main think I dislike is religion. I just want to kill all the missionaries
21149,"I love this game, it's not the best Civilization, but it's claimed a lot of my spare time."
21150,I have spent way too much of my life playing this game. I'm still not even that good. Worth it.
21151,Its good
21152,"ok

21162,It's good.
21163,awesome game
21164,"O.C.D. trap. Always one more thing you have to do. Same but different every time. Many, many hours of playtime."
21165,The heavyweight champion of 4x strategy games.   Just the best mix of everything.   Love the Civ franchise.
21166,After playing Civ 6 and being utterly disappointed about everything they did with Civ 6 I have removed it and come back to Civ 5.  It is a far better game with many many more playable mods.
21167,"great game simply put
"
21168,"yes, just yes? maybe some no but mostly yes."
21169,"With 650+ Hours, this has definitely been one of the best time killer board games (Yes Civ is a board game) I've ever played. Very fun with friends or alone. Get everything on sale and have a good time."
21170,Great depth and replayability even against CPUs.  Very addictive and polished game.  Still playing this game over its sequel Civ 6.
21171,10/10 would nuke Gandhi again.
21172,Fun but really addictive !
21173,its gud
21174,nice relaxing game
21175,You can puppet cities.
21176,Wtf
21177,"Mind Bending goodness
"
21178,"Really enjoy this game still, even after purchasing civ 6 i still find myself coming back to this game. If you like a strategic turn-based game, this is for you. Easy to get into and not overcomplicated."
21179,"When you get bored after the first 600 hours, install the Vox Populi mod and play for another 600."
21180,Excellent strategy game... have played since civ 3 and still never beat it above warlord!!
21181,The best civ game. You can colonise North America as Rome or go into space as Poland. Anything really.
21182,Ghandi killed my family while the ottomans conquered my coastal cities. Would recommend.
21183,"It's okay, worth a try."
21184,Fantastic game!
21185,Worse game ever fuck barbarians
21186,yuh
21187,its alright
21188,"If you like turn-based strategy games that let you decide what kind of victory you must accomplish, then this is for you.  Ways of winning are dominating the enemies, conquering the world, beating them all in a space race, culturally, and time (number of turns).  You can modify the difficulty level to advance to harder levels are you learn the game, and decide which historic leaders you want to compete with - or let the AI decide for you.  You build cities, discover new lands, build more units to protect your cities, develop new technologies.  I lot of fun once you get the hang of it.  And it's not that difficult to learn."
21189,I got this game as a gift from a friend and it has been very enjoyable.
21190,"THE MULTIPLE TIERS OF STRATEGY THAT HAVE TO BE NAVIGATED IN ORDER TO ACHIEVE YOUR GOAL AND ""WIN THE DAY"" IN THIS GAME."
21191,it's lit
21192,"Amazing game, 10/10 especially with Brave New World"
21193,is this game still only playable via online or can you finally play this game offline
21194,"do i have to say why this is good?  It's like 10 years old - if you have to think about getting this game, then you cannot know much about it."
21195,Apes alone weak. Apes together strong.
21196,"This game was a gift from a friend. And boy, i've got at least 444 hours in it. Endless nights of battling my friends for their  borders. Great game, and amazing score settler. 10/10 will capture your capital again.

this game plays really well. theres quite a learning curve and its very easy to lose if you dont know what you're doing. It takes some adapting to from scenario to scenario. Religion is a great playing piece and I highly reccomend cultivating it as early as possible. Also name your religion something stupid that will annoy your friends because let me tell you ITS AMAZING GETTING A NOTIFICATION READING LIKE ""Bucharest wants STDs"" 
You've got a lot of room to grow and play and strategize. not gonna lie I was able to pass my history class because this game taught me a lot about history.  
Get this game, have fun. Civ V is better than VI imo. 
destroy your friends."
21197,Dope af
21198,I like it the more I play it.
21199,it good
21200,"Low key transcendent. Easy to pick up, a blast with friends, and a monument to humanity's achievements and sins."
21201,Playing since CIV 3 here. This CIV5 is simpler than CIV4 is many aspects but hey still great enougth!
21202,If you thought that Heroes of Might & Magic was slow and long. Bro you ain't seen this shit yet. Fun though.
21203,I made the pyramids in Warsaw. That kind of behaviour is what causes the economy to collapse.
21204,Big good
21205,"If you are into empire sims then this is the game you need to get. It is really fun to play with friends, and to just set the win conditions to domination. Even if your not into empire sims or you are just starting out with them I would still recommend as its great fun and easy to get a hang of."
21206,its ait
21207,"A frustrating game where world leaders are selfish as hell and like to attack for absolutely the wrong reasons. 

10/10. Would take another turn."
21208,"If your time is worthless, then this game is worth it"
21209,"its good, but multiplayer kinda bad sometimes
"
21210,"It's grand strategy oversimplifed! Good replayability, easy learning curve, but requires the DLCs for a complete experience."
21211,gg
21212,"Better than 6 by far 
"
21213,Turn based strategy at its finest.
21214,quite good game
21215,"A lot of fun, if you like building vehicles or structures and coming up with your own ideas, then this is the game for you. Space engineers is a boat load of fun especially if you play with friends."
21216,"Totally immersive and challenging strategy game that has infinite parameters that are never predictable, especially at the higher difficulty settings."
21217,a civilised game
21218,"good game
"
21219,"It's a fun game. It wasn't exactly the best strategy game I've ever played but it had a good deal of content, customization in terms of how complex or simple you want the game to be, great mod support, nice visuals, and a pleasant soundtrack. My main complaint here is really the combat. It's just not all that satisfying. I could get more of a kick out of banging two action figures together. The real appeal of the game comes from building up an empire and managing its growth through a series of micromanagement choices.
If you're like me and looking more for a strategy title that focuses more on the combat, I'd recommend any of the Age of Empires games, especially 2, or any of the Total War games (namely Rome or Shogun 2).
Overall, 8/10. I would recommend to get it on sale and try it out that way."
21220,Really enjoy the game
21221,"amazin
"
21222,"fun, cerebral game."
21223,one of my favorite games of all time
21224,It's quite fun. Me and my brother play it together quite a bit.
21225,addictive
21226,Great game if you like city management games that are also competitive and require you to carefully plan each and every move with multiple ways to win the game and dlc giving you more options to continue the game even after victory
21227,"great time, cant wait to play with a few buddies"
21228,"Just look at the hours played, that's about all you need to know,"
21229,It's a pretty decent and replayable game in the traditional Civ mould.
21230,"good chill game 
"
21231,its ok
21232,Good
21233,"Excellent game, only buy if you have hours to go down the rabbit hole."
21234,Good gayme :)
21235,Addicting
21236,AMAZING GAME
21237,yeah
21238,"Just how do I begin to describe this game. It is just down right amazing how it is able to have the perfect balance of being not to hard for beginners to learn and not lacking complexity for those more experienced as many strategies can be used to get an extra edge.

There is a reason why there are still people are playing this game even 4 years after Civ 6 being released showing how great and different Civ 5 is. So if you have played Civ 6 and have not played Civ 5 yet, you wont be disappointed."
21239,Entertaining
21240,come guys you got to know civ its friken amazing. Although the AI is meh at best.
21241,"I started with AoE when it came out, I guess in the late 90s when I was real young. Stuck with that since as my go-to strat over the years. Although I'll still play it from time to time, Civ is my absolute JAM now. This game overwhelmed the shit out of me with information the first week or two of playing...there's so much to it, in a good, thorough way, but once you get the hang of it, it's very fulfilling and gives you a sense of accomplishment often."
21242,qwertyuiopasdfghjklzxcnm
21243,great game +1
21244,Exits after into.
21245,"Pros: keeps you interested I guess
Cons: you realize it's 2am"
21246,Cannot stop playing
21247,Game fun.
21248,"this game rocks, not sure about CIV 6 but if its anything like this awesome. also for sure get the complete edition as you get far more maps and civs to play"
21249,great game
21250,good
21251,Very fun and competitive with friends.
21252,It's good.
21253,time to destroy the other civilizations
21254,Yes.
21255,Fun
21256,it good
21257,"It's probably the best strategy game you can find on PC, and while I haven't played other games of the series I know I still have plenty of hours left before I'll get tired of it. I recommend playing it online with friends, it's the best way to play.

If you're new to the strategy game genre, all you need to know is while Civ 5 might look complex at first, it's playing it again and again, making mistakes, that you'll learn how to play. If you know you can sink the hours in, it's an amazing game. If you don't think you'll like strategy games or don't want to sink the hours in, maybe try a simpler strategy game?"
21258,Stop nuking me GHANDI!!!
21259,"good game, many hours played
"
21260,"Amazing game. So many ways to go, so many civ's  that give their own twist to the game. Make sure to get all DLC, especially Brave New World.
Truly addictive, know what you get yourself into... It takes some time to get the hang of the game, but it is fun exploring all the possibilities and see what strategies succeed and fail. With all the available mods you can completely overhaul the game if you somehow get bored. 
So far I would recommend this game over Civ 6."
21261,yes best game ever
21262,this game correctly shows that Ghandi knows what he's doing with those nukes
21263,"Over all, a wonderful addition to the Civ franchise.  It has great graphics, animation, & music.  I love the diversity of the different civilizations, religions, and the ability to customize them."
21264,"Just be ready to burn hours and hours and days and weeks and months of your life to this.

10/10"
21265,good shit eh
21266,classic
21267,"Has a bit of lag while scrolling, but it's a great addition to the Civilization family of building and development games.
"
21268,BEST GAME EVER!
21269,.
21270,niceeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee
21271,The number of hours I've been on this came is a testament to its playability.
21272,.
21273,This is THE quintessential strategy game experience.
21274,"Intuitive, in-depth, accurate, and simply fun to play."
21275,pretty cool
21276,The last good Civ to date.
21277,"One of the best strategy games out there, Far more balanced and superior than CIV 6"
21278,To some extent stands on equal to Civilization 6
21279,Great game. Takes a while to learn but there are a lot of web sites that will help the  novice
21280,Relatively easy to learn how to start but expansive enough so that you keep learning as long as you play. Every game is a different monster. Good times only
21281,Good Game
21282,Should've reviewed this 300 hours ago but this is an amazing game!
21283,V GUDE
21284,Pretty good
21285,"Base game is terrible, i dont recommend that, just putting it there first.
Now if you get the complete edition? The game is absolutely fantastic, playing all Civs all i can say is this by far is my favourite and couldnt recommend it more. One thing has to be said though, the devs never ever made the netcode good in any civ game. Your experience in multiplayer will suffer from this but its still enjoyable.
Game looks gorgeous still even with the dated release now, and all i can say is the one more turn addiction is real."
21286,Is fun :)
21287,"If you know, you know"
21288,I can stop any time I want
21289,Good game
21290,Nice
21291,"One of those games that you simply wont be able to close after opening. The games from Civilization series are probably the most addicting game I've ever played. The sandbox offers practically endless gameplay and the DLC:s and mods can enhance the experience even further. The game obviously isn't perfect and there are problems ranging from balancing issues to the AI and the length of the aircraft animations, but they are greatly beaten by the amount of good stuff this game has to offer, and some of them can be fixed with mods.

If you have any interest in 4X or strategy games, I would highly recommend Civ V."
21292,I have been a fan of Civ for a long time. The gameplay has only improved with each improvement. Kudos to team. And yes .. this is addictive as it goes ' One more turn...'
21293,"pretty good
"
21294,With mods the game never ends
21295,very addictive and very strategic turn-base game. great depth in the game and great graphics
21296,Got me into this style of game. Great fun on single player but best played with friends.
21297,Overwhelmingly Positive
21298,Hell yes
21299,"wat a well made and gr8 gayme! so fun to play and love reking other noobs XDDDDD
I love the music SASAGEYO SASAGEYO!!!!!!!!!!!!!! 
"
21300,Very good game
21301,Only if you can get all DLC for cheap
21302,cum :3
21303,"Hard to say whether this or civ 4 is better, but I haven't played a civilization game that I didn't enjoy. (Beyond Earth doesn't count)"
21304,way better game play than civ 6.
21305,awesome
21306,"Every couple months I think, ""Oh yeah, I could play a game of Civ."" Then it's hours later and I'm like, ""Oh, I haven't eaten yet."" 

If you haven't played a Civ game, be warned: You'll get sucked in."
21307,its ight
21308,"It's been enjoyable for me to play since I was a kid.  Some games hold up over time and for me, this is one of them."
21309,I love this game the strategy is challenging but fun
21310,Wow it good game
21311,fuck george washington.
21312,v good
21313,"its a good game, like the map editing also cause it make it more fun"
21314,"The whole Steam interface is too glitchy.
I can't restart games."
21315,MMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMM
21316,Great game that will eat hours of your time in solitude in quarantine.
21317,Best game ever made.
21318,"Fun and entertaining, thinking game."
21319,Great fun. I love civ games :)
21320,d
21321,I'M not a first person gamer. So this is what i like command.
21322,V
21323,love the franchise been playing sense civ 2
21324,VERY  FUN
21325,i do love this game a lot i would recomend this to a lot of types of people
21326,My favorite version of Civ to date. It's the best combination of the old and the new.
21327,Love this game. Been playing with friends during quarantine. Great way to pass the time!
21328,good
21329,"Twenty minutes to learn, weeks to master. It'll keep you entertained to the point where you forget time is a thing."
21330,awesome game brilliant on multipayer
21331,"Love the game, play it every now and then, keep loving it"
21332,The best of the series so far.
21333,One of the best franchises of all time A good romp for any strategy/turn-based fan.
21334,Great game (very addictive too!). Best of the current series in my opinion.
21335,"I would definitely recommend it!  I enjoy it more than Civ VI because it is far more straight forward and enjoyable.  If I had one caveat it would be that the expansion pack civs seem a tad bit overpowered compared to the originals, especially when played by the computer."
21336,"Great turn based game regardless of single player or multiplayer mode; so get this game and come chill with the bots that can be made to really test your metal. Bring your friends and verse them and see who dominates who and which method is the victor!? Win methods may vary between, score - from time, science - research, diplomatic - piety & patronage, culture - borders or good old fashioned and my personal favourite; domination - conquest [take the capital city of each main enemy civilization]. Also don't forget you can also go online with what already has every time iv looked an active community willing to have games from personal experience when checking."
21337,This is one of my favorite games. Turn based strategy at its finest. A true masterpiece of its kind.
21338,"Great strategic game, losing track of time is inevitable. Also it has lots of mods, so i suggest it."
21339,"Very nice, thanks, good, epic, very kool Kanye"
21340,It's pretty good
21341,gg
21342,You'll start a game at 5 pm and you wont realize its 4 am. Love when I can get that immersed into a game.
21343,It's a good game.
21344,I have 400 hours played.
21345,so this is how hitler did that
21346,gandhi will nuke you
21347,Easy to pickup and learn. Fun and lots of replay-ability.
21348,"As a strategy game noob, I found Civ 5 to be the easiest and most enjoyable entry into the genre I've tried so far. Highly recommended. I much prefer Civ 5's graphics to 6's (too cartoony)."
21349,Best strategy game ever created.
21350,i actually find Civ 5 to be tediously boring.  I am hoping 6 is much better .... I have 4 to fall back on
21351,worth the $ if its on sale!!
21352,Its a fun game that I Personally love
21353,"Wonderful game, complex but a lot of fun to play!"
21354,it's civ 5. if you like civ you'll like it.
21355,kinda epic
21356,"if you like turn based strat games this is it. civ v easier than civ vi. civ vi better than civ v when you're high.
"
21357,"Hundreds of hours of fun, especially if you're an achievement hunter."
21358,..................
21359,"Haven't played in a while but the game's great, endlessly replayable. Great DLC."
21360,"Alot of fun, can get very tedious at time, all in all, very solid game and would reccomend"
21361,"it is vary good for history class
"
21362,"great exciting game. Ai is a  bit dissapointing and some things can be rounded off, but still great to play
"
21363,Its good
21364,"""online interactions not rated by ESRB"". how about ""computer players interactions not rated by ESRB"" ? because, after almost 30 years of civilization francize, the A.I. players still act like internet trolls.
however, i recommend this game. just stay away from sid mayer's A.I. players :P"
21365,Yum
21366,"its better than civ 6
"
21367,I've been a Civ player since the original.  This is my favorite flavor of the game.  Most played game in my Steam library.  The hours don't accurately reflect play time as I play twice as much offline due to fulltime van life and remote locations.
21368,fucking epic
21369,One... more... turn...
21370,10/10
21371,Watch out for war mongering Ghandi with his early stone age nukes.
21372,ever need to pull an all nighter just play this game.
21373,A lot more bugs than civ 6.
21374,It is very fun and good you should buy it
21375,I turned Sailor Moon's land into nuclear hell. 10/10
21376,One of my all time favorite games. I think Firaxis is greedy for have too many expansion packs. I can get full games for the kind of money they want over and over.
21377,"A game that eats a lot of times, but for good reasons, as every action is satisfing in the upmost manner... If you're winning, the biggest downside of the game tough is it's learning curve, as for it to be most enjoyable, you need to be experimented in it."
21378,The last good Civ Game.
21379,worth to play again and again
21380,"Multiplayer is so badly bugged as to make it unplayable.  Scenarios aren't great.  Overall too slow and unpolished, when it actually works.  Unless you have a good reason to buy it, I wouldn't waste the $$."
21381,Mongolia #1
21382,"the civilization games have always been a favorite of mine because of the way they work with balancing the difficulties of running a country, having a fun game, and making this game a learning experience"
21383,is aight
21384,Wonderful
21385,"Best civilization building game and likely the best we'll ever get. Been a fan of the series since the start and this is the strongest iteration. Great game, every gamer should own."
21386,one of the best turn-based strategy games ever.  Tons of replayability.  I highly recommend if that's your thang.
21387,"BUILD YOUR CIVILISATION, PEASANTS!"
21388,"It's dope, lots of different ways to play that are rewarded and enhanced by the huge number of civilizations, very understandable mechanics and progression that is simultaneously easy to understand and has enough depth to be interesting."
21389,"solid game with hundreds if not thousands of hours of enjoyment
"
21390,Best All around Civ game.
21391,I also play this game with Arthur and the boys. It is indeed good fun!
21392,great game
21393,Endless replayability
21394,"The game can be played to several different types of victories. In the harder levels agains the computer it becomes close to impossible to win with just brute military force... though, that doesn't stop me from trying :-p"
21395,One more turn
21396,"An actual civ game, still enjoyable after all these years - either that or this covid seclusion makes it seem more enjoyable. Much harder to remember how to play, and more fun after playing wutever civ6 is! 
Dear Siddy Meier..all i want is civ4 but 2024 grphx, and when u beat sceince u continue into space and colonize diff planets..civ style.kkthxbyeeee."
21397,better than CIV 6
21398,"I want to spread my religion, Vaseline"
21399,good game
21400,everything
21401,very good game
21402,"amazing
all there is to it"
21403,Great game for a pandemic quarantine.
21404,Good game.
21405,"So many different ways to play, explore and win. Plus a great cross-section of leaders as well as difficulty levels."
21406,"Fun game, love building a peaceful civ until someone messes with me and then I destroy them"
21407,"Highly rewarding game play, great community and mods"
21408,"Like: Playing this Game
Dislike: The time travel feature is unable to be disabled.  Huge amounts of time vanish before my eyes with little to no knowledge it is happening."
21409,Still good.
21410,I play this game with Arthur and the boys. It's good fun.
21411,pretty chill game to just chill and play when yoiure chilling:))))):3
21412,"I mean the solo games are long af, but kinda nice. I have no clue what im doing wrong, but barabrians take over my lands with ease, my people hate me, other countries always team up against me, i suicide bomb my artists."
21413,Great game.
21414,"Civ V in one of the best Civ games, always fun to play, not too many extra features, e.g. politics, religion etc. I also play and enjoy the later Civ games of which Beyond Earth is a favorit., however I often go back to Civ  V with it's cute barbarians and enjoyable armies."
21415,Great
21416,"Nice game, I linke it even more than Civ 6."
21417,good game
21418,Classic game
21419,The best CIV game.
21420,"Just good fun, I started playing civ 2 back in early years this is amazing compared to that and the xbox civ"
21421,gud but old
21422,I have really enjoyed the strategy piece against harder opponents. Overall the games fluidity and increasingly challenging AI have allowed me to enjoy countless hours of RTS play. I would recommend to anyone who is looking for a combination of RISK & Age of Empires with considerably more options for strategy.
21423,"Nice but with long play time, its boring"
21424,yes
21425,ghjkytfghj
21426,"I like the turn based strategy.
AI is very decent for solo play"
21427,"It's the best Civ, 'nough said."
21428,Fantastic game.
21429,Got this when it was on sale: $15 for the game and every single dlc. Best money I ever spent on a game.
21430,"Yep. Play it, it's good."
21431,"Amazing, best to play vs real people like friends but even pve is fun! Definatelly worth it!"
21432,Awesme game
21433,Doesn't run on Win 10 without problems.
21434,great game not much more to say
21435,This is a fantastic game that when you start playing you don't know that the next time you look at the clock it will be 6 hours later
21436,good
21437,"Awesome game.  I haven't encountered any bugs.  I don't like playing with religion, so I am just playing the base game.  You can turn barbarians off.  The game is challenging to learn, and there are 8 difficulty levels!  I like the fact that you can turn cultural victory on and off."
21438,good game
21439,"this game is a lot of fun, but takes a lot of patience"
21440,i only played a little but it seems fun
21441,"Played it for a little while.  It's pretty good, I guess."
21442,"This is 4X gaming at its finest, except for square-tile purists or those who want a fast-paced experience (like an RTS game), or a game that has excruciatingly in-depth historical and political events (like Paradox games.) After a decade, Civ V is still going strong, and can provide hours of digital board gaming in a way that is accessible enough for new and casual strategy players, but challenging enough for veterans. In addition to all that, the ability to use mods, low system requirements, compatibility with the three major OSs are compelling points. However, expansions are very important for the full experience, as they address balancing while adding a ton of content and mechanics. Luckily, the Complete Edition is relatively inexpensive when on sale."
21443,My friend Cameron recommended this game because of it's Dark Souls level of difficulty. I lost 23 games on turn 6 and I love that it doesn't hold your hand through the game.
21444,"Very fun, 
Games take forever."
21445,Game holds up
21446,uh oh stinky la mayo
21447,258 hrs bought at $40 on steam sale before Civ6 at $00.15 an hour its a great deal thanks guys
21448,great game
21449,"With all the dlc this is one of the most solid strategy games out there. Can't go wrong, especially since it goes on sale pretty frequently"
21450,"This game is a truly great test of your strategy skills and it is especially fun since you can play with all your friends or by yourself. Current level too easy? you can move up a skill level at a time and train yourself on how to crush your enemies with your mighty iron fist! or not of course... you can bean them in other ways as well such as being the first man on the moon, but why stop there? theres a million ways to play the game, and each new way you find shows its own unique rewards. I personally have never had more fun than role playing your civilization through a great game with my friends. 11/10 definitely my favorite game ever"
21451,where did the hours go
21452,very fun game
21453,"Good game. Much diplomacy, LOTS OF FIGHTS, I likes."
21454,"game pretty awesome, 24 hours in 2 days and im sure theres significantly more to come!"
21455,Really fun strategy game.  I love the different ways to win and each play through feels unique.
21456,"fun game, would do again
"
21457,"its tuff
"
21458,This game is so much fun!  I recently got back into playing it with my buddies and we bought all the DLC.  We're looking forwards to playing a lot more games together!
21459,dope
21460,"I LOVE the Civ games !  I play them almost daily . 
mostly 5 & 6 recently
"
21461,"This game is an amazing game. The mechanics of this game are good, although the multiplayer might need some fixing. I have encountered a glitch where we can try to start a standard internet multiplayer game, and the game freezes and the screen is covered with a layer of white. Other than that, this game is very good, once again."
21462,it's actually a game
21463,Its awesome
21464,"Jesus please release me from this horrific world every passing moment is an agonizing eternity of unbearable pain I crave the sweet release of death.



great game worth checking out I give it a 9/10"
21465,is nice game...99.8% dicsount helps
21466,Very Good. Must play.
21467,Addictive. Hours of fun.
21468,Timeless
21469,"Ridiculous that ""cross-platform"" isnt possible anymore if one of you runs on one of the newer OSX"
21470,"Absolutely smashing. Arguably better than Civ 6 with mods, at least up to par with it. A great experience, and a purchase you will not regret. Next time this goes on sale, buy it."
21471,yes
21472,user friendly
21473,Great game to toke and watch podcasts to when you want some down time. Im planing on buying civ 6 when i can afford it.
21474,favorite strategy game of all time
21475,"i can see why this game is overwhelmingly positive. Me being to take over the world in a click of a mouse is actually amazing. Me just trying to game with the bois in a rts is maybe the easiest expirience for me and them as well. Just got done playing 40 mins of P U R E  gameplay and my game crashes just when everything is starting to get good and im at the peak of starting my true attacks. Now once i crash i could start it up like any other game and join in with ease and get back into the fight. But i guess not once i join back everything on the game  just shits the bed and now ive lost all interest in the game and rts in general. thank you civ for bringing me this monster of a game.

Rise of nations is better and i barely know what im doing in the first place. :)"
21476,"This game is a hallmark of turn-based strategy games, putting forward it's best strengths and proving the ""just one more turn"" gameplay is in fact quite potent."
21477,It's aight.
21478,It was very fun and addicting
21479,"Excellent strategy game. I have been play different versions of Civ since the late 90s. This one, this is my absolute favorite."
21480,pretty dope game. better than civ 6 imo
21481,"ultimate replay value. big maps, plenty of play/win types. unique advantages for each nation. good for people with plenty of time also great for people with not so much time. not overly complicated. give it a shot. you're not likely to regret it."
21482,"I have played Civilization since it came out originally nearly 30 years ago.  I loved it then, I love it now."
21483,"It is easy to sink 6-8 hours at a time in this game. This is one of the first games I have played. I am still learning stuff but, I am having so much fun. 
So, yeah I would recommend this to others."
21484,very good game. Buy carlos
21485,civ is a great series and the old releases are still fun to play to this day.
21486,Good game. Only note is even more depth would be great.
21487,Fun game!
21488,too buggy
21489,Best Civ ever
21490,Fun with friends
21491,"Most likely the best Civ game ever made, i have hundreads off hours with this game.

And i never get bored. The best strategy game ever!"
21492,good
21493,Excellent game.. however each campaign will consume roughly 3 days of your week.
21494,Love it.
21495,The definitive 4X game.
21496,its civ 5 if you like RTS's its a staple.
21497,help how do i get my life back
21498,its good.
21499,good
21500,"Great game to play with friends, but don't play with barbarians on if it is your first time"
21501,Love it better than Civ 6 way better. Buy this not Civ 6 ok guys.
21502,perfect
21503,"Very fun game. While this game is older than Civilization 6, the DLC and base game can be found on sale often for cheap. Solo games are fun, and there many multiplayer games going on too. This game may be hard at first but guides and in-game tutorials help."
21504,10/10
21505,Best Civ Probably Maybe
21506,"This has been my favorite game to pass time with while in quarantine. I've really enjoyed playing it with my brother. Easily a 10/10, and super addicting."
21507,I love this game! LONG LIVE WU ZETIAN
21508,"The best civ, hands down."
21509,This game is super addictive. One more turn = one whole day gone.
21510,its okay i guess
21511,el spico
21512,Can't play on an apple product with Windows players.
21513,i have no friends now

21515,nib
21516,LOVE THIS GAME. Wish I didn't have to buy so many DLCs
21517,Bought it yesterday to play a game with friends during quarantine. 11 hrs played already. All you need to know really.
21518,"Oh, geez... do you want to mysteriously teleport into tomorrow? Play this game. Its habit of making you want to take ""just one more turn"" and ""just finish this one thing up"" will make tomorrow's morning sun shine through your window when you still thought it was 9pm the previous night. The game is mesmerizing and time wasting in a way that no other game franchise has ever done. All the Civ games have been this way.
I've played a lot of several of the Civ games, and I honestly have to admit that I still am a bit fuzzy on some of the rules and how some of the game mechanics affect what happens in the game. I really don't understand them very well. If I better understood how all the different actions in the game affected what was happening, I'd probably have a better time. As it stands, it's just something to waste my time when I want tomorrow to come faster."
21519,The hardest thing to do in Civ V is finish a full game of Civ V
21520,good lol
21521,Been a fan of the CIV franchise since i first played it on PS1 back in the day. That being said Civ 5 has grown on me since it was 1st released and I still love playing (especially with some of the awesome mods)..
21522,it was guud
21523,its fun
21524,Best drug I ever had
21525,Way better than Civ 6. Get this instead.
21526,I enjoy conquering nations without shooting up my local grocery store. Good meme 9/10.
21527,It's like crack
21528,"Ive owned it for 4 days and i already have this much on it, don't bother with VI it sucks"
21529,I bought this game to play with my Dad and sister. We have been playing Civ games for years. But this new update that doesn't not allow crossplay has been a game breaker for us. With technology these days there is no reason why they needed to send of that update. All they had to do was leave well enough alone. I will not be buying anymore Aspyr products
21530,"Amazing
"
21531,"Once all the bugs were worked out over a couple years time, this entry earned its place as a classic of the genre."
21532,Can be brutally confusing and terribly fun.
21533,yes
21534,"Yeah really solid civ game, buy it"
21535,cuz its good!!!
21536,I haven't played Civ in more than 10 years. Most of the features I remember being a part of the base game seem to be DLC now. Very sad.
21537,"Destroyed my friendships, but i took their capitals! 
Very Good 10/10"
21538,"Steam has ruined this game. It is literally unplayable, because steam error messages before it will even run. I miss Civ 4."
21539,"When I first heard they were making a Civ game with hex tile combat I thought that was silly and terrible, but it works quite well.  It solves the issue most Civ games have of just having one big stack military that wanders the globe.  You actually have to protect borders, have synchronized land and sea invasions, things like forts actually mattering, and wars feel more like wars, with battles stretched across empires.  The game also has city-states, small civilizations that can be important trade partners, or you can use to wage proxy wars, and combined with the new military system can be important just to be able to move troops through their territory, much like in real life.

Besides that, the game takes the non-military civilization building up a notch and refines the old formula quite well."
21540,I love this game.
21541,"After playing this game since I was 11 years old, 2 expansions and countless mods later, and ""2600"" hours played (Inflated number, left running in the background for hours at a time)  I still love the replay value this game has. Best Civilization game to date."
21542,Everything but Ghandi
21543,bretty gud
21544,Amazing game! You can play for hours and hours!
21545,cool stuff
21546,"Great game, not overly complicated, but still fun to play"
21547,"very good, real nice big time, v fun"
21548,"Fun single or multiplayer game,"
21549,Cannot go wrong with this classic
21550,"10/10 game, always coming back for more. Time slips away, it doesn't feel like I have played 177 hours.
The game is fun alone or with any number of friends, the map types and other game options keep the game fresh."
21551,Always a good challenge.  Helps the time go by.
21552,"In my opinion still the best Civilization because it is not overly complex and yet complex enough to enjoy all strategic decisions in every turn. I especially like the Mongols scenario because it is doable on deity difficulty because there are not as many random elements as in the normal game. Other thatn that, if you want a random game I wouldn't play the other scenarios because they are not random enough and for less randomness the other scenarios are too random, but the normal game is already fun enough.
Character animations don't work in multiplayer, which is a shame, but not very annoying if you are playing with friends. And that would be one of the few downsides of the game, aside from not being able to take enemy settlers as settlers instead of turning them into builders."
21553,883 hours so far - i recommend!
21554,Once started it's really difficult to stop playing :)
21555,Nice
21556,"It's great, everyone knows it's great."
21557,Why are all these people unhappy i'm only at war with everyone...
21558,always fun to play single player. Classic game.
21559,"It's like Risk, but more fun."
21560,This game comes with a Ron Swanson seal of approval. Buy this game.
21561,Great game. A lot of fun alone but best with some friends
21562,"never trust ""one more turn"""
21563,good
21564,Game is engaging with multiple variations. I can play an alignment that suits my mood. Solo is most fun for me because human teams against the AI is too powerful.  I like the wonders.  I like getting achievements. I like the pace.
21565,lovely game
21566,Yes
21567,My first Civ game. Love it.
21568,"Bought a copy for my Girlfriend so we can play on separate devices.
She uses Mac, after not playing for 6 months we come back and crossplay Mac to PC has been disabled in the 64 bit update.

If you want to do anything other than play single player or ONLY with other people on PC, DONT buy this.
Definitely DONT buy this on Mac."
21569,Good
21570,best civ game
21571,Still better than VI.
21572,1 more review...
21573,"With all available add-ons, this game is excellent. It held true for Civ IV, I'm told it holds true for Civ VI, and it definitely holds true for Civ V."
21574,"very cool took me back to AOE2
"
21575,Good game and work well on linux
21576,fuckign love it!
21577,i liek
21578,"Still reccomend buying. If you're new to the genre, you can just get this game for dirt cheap and still get many 100+ hours of enjoyment giving ya time for civ 6 to get cheaper. If you don't enjoy it, you probably wouldn't like civ 6"
21579,Nice
21580,I played this for 12 hours straight. 2-days in a row. Probably gonna do the same today as I've already started.
21581,"There is no greater time-sink than Civ. It is the definition of ""just one more turn."" 
The world is your oyster. Take it."
21582,not much of a massive turn based games but its alright.
21583,Get Salt GG
21584,is gooed
21585,Solid game.
21586,"Great interface.  My favorite turn -based strategy game.  Beware,  it can be addictive."
21587,its civ 5 just do it.
21588,its ok i guess
21589,bro how have i played this game so long and i am still awful
21590,yup
21591,"Careful - This game is a time-sink.   Before you know it, the sun will be rising and you will wonder where the h3ll the night went.  Wonderfully addictive, and definitely replayable.   I haven't played Civ VI yet, but after another marathon session of Civ V, I don't feel any need to upgrade.  The gameplay is on point."
21592,"[h1] This is a Tentative 'Yes' Recommendation [/h1]

[b] In a Nutshell: [/b]
[i] Civ 5 shifts from a grid system of squares to a hexagonal system, which feels more natural and allows for some interesting strategy.

Don't have to worry about the wall of death anymore (stacked unit wall that would creep toward your towns)

Gameplay is generally fun and can be challenging with Civ bonuses at higher difficulties
AI programming is generally terrible still, and the AI tends to make silly decisions without much reason.

Diplomacy is a joke for the most part, and the addition of spying is neat but a bit crude in execution. [/i]

[b] Final Verdict: [/b] Civ 6 is out so this should be on sale.  If you can buy it for less than $10 it is worth it.

[h2] The Review [/h2]
[b]  The Good: [/b]
The new format for tiles combined with the 1 unit per tile limitation makes for real strategy when attacking and defending.

The game has a number of expansions, each with plenty of content and civs with unique but useful bonuses.  Rarely did I think, ""wow, this civ is trash, who would play it?""

Tooltips were helpful and technological advancement design makes sense.  You have to meet reasonable prerequisites to advance to the next era.

[b] The Bad [/b]
The AI is, well, dumb.  Many times you'll be met with resistance while offering to trade with a civ only to be offered the same trade or similar the next turn.  Same goes for diplomatic efforts such as open borders or declaration of friendship.  

Good luck getting any defensive pacts too, though civs have no problem soliciting you for help in their struggles.

With the above, you can become a warmonger only if you engage in war of your own volition and it only takes one war to brand you as a warmonger with some civs.  Nevermind your reign lasts 5000 years, one war in 1000 b.c. means you're a warmonger into the year 2050.

[b] The Ugly [/b]
The AI is written so poorly that difficulty is increased via the handicap system.  The AI gets bonuses to production / science / happiness etc while the player incurs penalties.  Fundamentally, though, the AI behaves the same way.  It is still stupid, can't effectively manage unit types, can't engage in any degree of reasonable diplomacy, and can't manage its towns and people.  I understand that AI in strategy games is difficult to produce, but this smacks of laziness and doesn't mitigate the aggravating mechanics encountered in easier difficulties."
21593,very fun game if u only play once
21594,it good

21613,great!
21614,It took me 500 years but i finally beat ghandi with nukes
21615,"Much more accessible than Civ 3, which tormented me for years. I find it challenging without feeling needlessly complicated nor requiring constant attention to the cities to make sure they aren't cannibalizing themselves. Also city combat has become better, where you may only station a single unit in the city, eliminating the endless stacking of units from prior eras."

21625,"An old classic. This game will not get old, and if you want to play a more balanced and expanded civ 5 go download LEKMOD from the No Quitter's reddit, I'll link it below. If want more options for your maps, go download Hellblazer's Map-pack to make more enjoyable maps to play on whilst retaining good balancing.

21638,a
21639,"Very Fun :)
"
21640,Multiplayer netcode is a joke.
21641,"It's a very fine game. I've played most every version of Civ, and while this one is a big departure from I through IV, the spirit of the original game is still there, along with lots of improvements, a good look, and a smooth UI. Civ has never been my favorite strategy game, but it's probably the most compelling and relaxing of the games I play. One reason is that war is not inevitable; you spend a lot of time exploring, expanding, building, and trading. When war did come, in Civ I through IV, my heart sank; I knew I was in for an experience I wouldn't like (and I'm an old wargamer, so I usually do like war in games). In Civ V, it's different; there are no ""stacks of doom,"" and war is manageable and somewhat tactical. Because it's such a relaxing game, there are stretches of boredom even for me, and some people might find too much of it, especially late in the game. On the other hand, there's plenty of room for micromanagement and optimization, for those who dig into that sort of thing (I don't). I haven't tried Civ VI yet, and I only play in single-player mode. But if I'm going to play Civ, Civ V is the one I go to. If you think you'll like this sort of game, it's well worth it to grab the ""complete"" edition at a good price."
21642,Awesome game
21643,SO MANY FUCKING BUGS AND GLITCHES FIX THE FUCKING GAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAME
21644,"""By far the best round based strategy game there is.""

In the beginning the game might overwhelm you with the sheer amount of information one needs to process, but given 1 or 2 games and soon you will fin yourself getting absorbed deeper and deeper in the individual game mechanics. Trying to improve on each subsequent game and devising build orders and ways of boosting your civilization. 

Would recommend 11/10"
21645,This game is fun to play

21688,"The best Civilization version of the game. Do not go for VI, it is prettier but in all other ways it is worse (gameplay, rules etc. etc). And this comes from experience, I have 650hours+ on Civ V and around 60h on Civ VI.
I would rank the latest Civs in this order:
1. Civilization V
2. Civilization IV
3. Civilization VI

Hope this helps, thanks."

21706,"With the level set to Settler (easiest), in the crazed times we're living in, you can accomplish things in a meditative fashion, building up your civ. Infinitely re-playable, with various civs, scenarios, and difficulties. I didn't upgrade to Civ VI because I like V so much!"
21707,Yes
21708,"Base game is ok, mods make it great, and in my opinion superior to civilization 6.

21740,It's alright I guess
21741,"Great game with tons of replayability, but I still believe that Civ4 is better."

[h1]Sid Meier's Civilization V Review[/h1]
Sid Meier’s Civilization V is a 4X turn-based strategy game developed by Firaxis Games and published by 2K Games and Aspyr Media. The game was released on Microsoft Windows and macOS in 2010, and later on Linux in June 2014. It is the 5th installment in the Sid Meier’s Civilization franchise that has sold over nine million copies worldwide.

[h1]Gameplay[/h1]
Civilization V is challenging and super fun, but it never gets repetitive or boring. You start of by leading a prehistoric civilization into the future with the help of research, exploration, diplomacy, and military conquest. You can choose from a total of 43 cultures and assume the role of its leader, where each one has two unique combat units and buildings. Over 6050 years, your small settlement must grow & achieve the victory conditions to win or survive until the end of the game turns, after which the civilization with most game points wins. The end victor is decided on many factors such as population, culture, and technological advancement.
Victory in the game can be attained by focusing on scientific research and building a spaceship to win the space race. Or you may focus on diplomacy and subdue other civilizations. Otherwise, world domination is possible, but other options are more straightforward than this. In the core gameplay, over the turns, the player has to manage civilian and military tasks. The civic duties include finding new cities, expanding, spreading religion, and building the most magnificent human-made wonders. On the other hand, the military can be used to raise an army & battle to take over other civilizations. 
What’s changed?
Civ V encourages tactical gameplay after they renovated its warfare mechanism. You cannot stack your troops into a single tile, unlike its precedents, thus allowing different types of strategies to face your enemy and allow flanking. Now each combat unit occupies one unique space; Therefore, unit positioning is very crucial in Civ V as it’ll require a bit of planning, although it might get tedious to move around each unit in a large force individually. Once you capture a city, you can place a puppet ruler who will rule in your stead, thus freeing you from governing it and focusing more on warfare. 
Unlike previous games, the game now wholly divides the map into hexagonal tiles instead of squares, and not only cities defend themselves by firing at enemies, but also, the town expands one or two tiles at a time. 

[h1]Diplomacy[/h1]
The diplomacy system remains mostly unchanged; you meet other leaders and can trade with them or enter agreements like Co-operation and Pacts of Secrecy. If you are helpful to them, and do the tasks or give them gold, they will provide you with food, culture, or military units. But if you attack them, they may declare permanent war against your civilization. The system is not perfect either as leaders may suddenly declare war and catch you off guard even without provocation. The city-states are a great addition to the game. They are not to win the game or take anything over, but they just add complexity to world diplomacy.

[h1]Graphics[/h1] 
Graphics may not be the most significant concern it’s a a turn-based strategy game after all, but Civ V does an outstanding job on attention to details and its art style. The map is bright and vibrant and almost feels like a lively virtual board game. Zooming in on fur resource tiles will show foxes sporting together. Mounts and food resources will show sheep, cattle, and horses grazing in their tiles. Each style of buildings and wonders differs from other cultures and civilizations, which makes the game visually striking.

[h1]The Verdict[/h1]
Civ V is the most fantastic and critically acclaimed game by fans all over the world. It is one of ‘better’ empire-building games that remains unmatched even after ten years of its release. Its also considered among Top 50 games made for PC with over 90+ hours of playtime potential and additional two expansions to add even more. I highly recommend it undoubtedly.

Rate: 10/10"
21761,game is good
21762,Just one more turn...
21763,it's nice
21764,An absolute gem of turn based strategy. Never know how a game is going to turn out and it holds up well given it's age. Cannot recommend enough.
21765,Love this franchise and this game is rivalled by none
21766,"Fun, Challenging, Time consuming."
21767,Endless fun
21768,"I've been playing Civilization since its very first version.  I very much recommend the game.  Especially Civ5.  It's one of the best versions of the game available.  I also suggest getting all the DLC.  Well, not the music.  But the individual Civs, yes.  By the way, don't bother with Civ6.  They must've made that version for kids.  It's awful.  But Civ5 rocks.  The only thing I can think of that I don't like about Civ5 is the fact that you can't stack units.  I miss that."
21769,"I like this game
"
21770,It was good.
21771,"Have played all the different Civilization games over the years and this one is as good if not better than the others. Such a great franchise of games, never get bored with it, just one more turn!"
21772,"After more than 1000 hours of gameplay I'm starting to understand some of the gameplay mechanics. But it's still easier to win by world domination. A fun, predictable, game."
21773,Great game! great replay value and the multiplayer works very well and is fun with 3 or more players. 5 stars
21774,"good game





:)"
21775,Just one more turn
21776,Great time passer.
21777,"Not necessarily the most accurate simulation of real world politics or affairs, but this turn-based strategy game never intended so. 

From settling your first city, to rolling out roads that connect your capital to your various cities and outposts acquired through either settlers or conquests, the constant lie you'd find yourself telling is ""just one more turn and I will call it a day.""

It is not for those who want something casual. It is not like your ONS - pants off, you jizz after a minute or two, and you leave. It takes hours to get into the midgame, and hundreds more to win or lose a game on a large map, depending on your mode of victory. 

I would recommend this game to whoever wants to invest a few hundred hours in this game.

P.S. this is my second account. Spent about 500 hours on this game previously."
21778,It seems very realisitic simulation of world leaders and  dynamics of world politics and economies
21779,"This game is an obsession. If you want a game with deep tech trees that will make you forget to pee and feed yourself, this is it. you will not be able to attend to any bodily needs until your senses are screaming at you.  You keep telling yourself ""one more turn"" until your muscles are screaming in stiffness and you're ready to eat your own fingernails and hair. It's that good.  Try to keep snacks handy."
21780,Good game.
21781,nice
21782,incredibly dull.
21783,addictive
21784,yeyee
21785,beautiful game.....just beautiful
21786,"I have played some version of Civilization since the original. Mastered most of my tactics/game plans in Civ 2. Then my 20s came and I skipped 3 and 4. Hands down, Civ 5 is the best turn based strategy game I have ever played, including Civ 6 (which is cool but I just can't put down this game.) The only similar game from all decades that I enjoy most is Colonization (the original). Highly recommend spending the roughly 600 turns it takes to become a formidable player in Civ V."
21787,"Are you joking? Why are you even reading reviews about this game? It's probably older than you and it has been around for that long for a reason. Just buy, play and forget about the rest of your library for a while."
21788,"It's great, especially with friends"
21789,amazing!
21790,very nice
21791,"Huge replay value. Fun to play with friends (cross-platform with Mac and PC is effectively shutdown though), and there are many different playstyles. Very well made game!"
21792,fun
21793,One of my favorite games to waste a whole lot of time in
21794,"Great game with fun and rich mechanics as well as meaningful strategy.  I wouldn't recommend picking up the game without all the expansion packs as they add a lot to the game in the form of religions, espionage, etc.  All around a great thing to buy while you're quarantined inside."
21795,This is one of my all time favorite games.
21796,f
21797,v good rts.
21798,"Its just the best game, once you get into it."
21799,good
21800,y7jkih
21801,great game
21802,e
21803,"Considering the year it got out, pretty nice overall.
After 2-3 playthroughs I kinda have a harder time wanting to jump back into it regularly but when I do it's 10-15 hours of strait up fun."
21804,good fun lots to learn
21805,very good
21806,"Challenging, but fun."
21807,"Civilization V is one of the greatest 4X games ever made. As someone who loved Civ III as a child, Civ V feels like a near perfect upgrade. The ""one more turn"" gameplay is as addicting as ever before, and I love all the different play styles supported."
21808,BEST GAME EVER MADE
21809,"Good game but f#ck it can get complex, though no where near as much as factorio."
21810,its civ
21811,Addicting AF
21812,"This game is hella fire except for the bug that occasionally happens in the industrial age with workers. Also, the multiplayer layout is awful and is hard to figure out."
21813,"In the time I've owned this game, and with 257 hours in my pocket, I still haven't been able to explore everything within it. This game...This game has so much to it and requires such a massive time investment, I recommend it highly for anyone who has and needs something to do for an extended period of time.

But be warned: You will be spending hours in this game depending on how you set it up. Also, if you're a history buff, this game is decent for you. Although it does have some slow loading times. But, it's worth it in the end.

Perfect for the present situation in the world as I'm typing this (Covid19) if you really want some strategy to work for you."
21814,"Buy it now, what are you waiting for? DO IT!
"
21815,This by far the superior version of Civilization. Civ VI is slower and more difficult to have as immediate an experience
21816,"A great chapter in the series. Like all the other progressions, adds elements, graphics and features the previous editions lacked. The fact that cities are so difficult to take compared to III and IV is more realistic."
21817,"Addictiive gameplay and amazing graphics, anyone who is a fan of the previous Civilization games will love this one."
21818,Killed my last computer. 10/10
21819,"This is the best game in the world. Don't care what you think. Your opinion is wrong
"
21820,good game
21821,good
21822,Best single player strategy game of all time. Hands down
21823,Help i downloaded this and cant stop playing
21824,I mean honestly this game is pretty close to perfection. What more do you want?
21825,"Still good after 10 years, cant believe ive just found this game"
21826,one of the best civs
21827,"The best turn-based strategy game. For those who love chess, Rome:Total War, AoE, this is the game for you. The complexity will keep you coming back for more."
21828,"Recreate historical battles using Montezuma's Terracotta Army against the Great Wall of Portugal. Bask in the cultural splendor of Poland's Pyramids, the Leaning Tower of Arabia, and Mongolia's epic space program. The accurate portral of Ghandi's nuclear assault against the barbarian hordes of Scandinavia is chilling."
21829,Worth the money!
21830,"i literally cannot stop playing this game, please send help"
21831,"While this is the first version to step more towards a RTS feel, it is fun and worth the investment.  Honestly a decent edition (especially with mods)."
21832,"This is a very enthralling game. You will fall in love with running simulations over and over again with different historical world leaders. But, it is very worthwhile and you can win at civilization in different ways, such as through military conquest, scientific advancement, cultural influence, or diplomatic victory. Then, you can unlock different achievements by completing different tasks, such as building a floating garden next to a lake tile while playing as the Aztecs, or killing a Russian spy while playing as England, etc. In short, this is a game that can entertain you for months, years even. So, it is definitely worth the dollar value. Replay value is very high."
21833,"Too addicting, it almost ruined my marriage."
21834,Very fun and time consuming game.
21835,hahhaha xD
21836,It is fun and challenging
21837,Best Civ game ever created. Civ VI can suck my taint.
21838,"Civ Peaked right here. Plenty of factions, and great workshop/community support make it a must have."
21839,Very Fun
21840,Wonderful game that can be mastered and won in different ways.  Endlessly engaging
21841,Good
21842,great game
21843,Timeless classic
21844,U cant go wrong with this one if u like turn based strategies. If u dont like turn based games dont go into this one.
21845,"An amazing game to play with friends, and alone. In depth strategy and tactics."
21846,Just one more turn...
21847,I just find it all round great game to play to help me to unwind.
21848,An absolute blast for any era
21849,good game but stuck in slow motion
21850,fun game nice play enjoy bigly good time!!!!!!!!!!
21851,"Good time waster, has aged very well."
21852,its okay
21853,"Iconic empire building sim that can be played in so many ways to achieve victory. The original CIV series , been keeping me happy for over a decade."
21854,It's good stuff
21855,"Very good graphics
"
21856,Not bad.
21857,"If I didnt like it, I wouldnt have kept playing :shrug:"
21858,"From a guy who lived on Rise Of Nations for years, civ is a cool change, slower, but more thoughtful and waaaaay more involved. If you're a smart person looking for a challenge this is a good one."
21859,"Hoestly, this is a game I'd play if I want to multitask. It's engaging long and there's so much to do that I can work while playing this game xD I love it!"
21860,"I've played since Civilization 3 and I think this one is my favorite. Units not being able to stack makes warfare really fun, as there is a strong element of strategy to how the game mechanics work. I recently tried playing with another person and that was also really fun, which a hybrid turn order, where turns are taken simultaneously during peace time and turns alternate during war with the human player. Very fun!"
21861,"i love all of the Civ games, this one is probably my favorite though. I am old and not up to first person shooters this is just my speed, at the higher levels it is challenging and at the lower levels it is just a pleasant afternoon unwind."
21862,"Perfect to numb your mind if you play on Settler. This isn't meant as an insult, but a compliment, if that wasn't already evident."
21863,Brilliant
21864,"Awesome, ever changing."
21865,stuff and things
21866,i love civ
21867,its civ 5 yall know what youre getting into
21868,I just got back into gaming
21869,One of the classic games
21870,"Just one more turn...

Anywho, I've got to say this is still probably the best CIV game out there.

Not much to explain, if you like and have played CIV games this is the best of the best. Hopefully CIV 7 will take the success from this game and continue to make the series the best it can be."
21871,fun
21872,Best strategic game ever!
21873,A must buy for anyone who loves turn based strategy games. I love this edition of the Sid Meier's Civ series better than the more current Civ VI edition.
21874,Good game
21875,still the best of the bunch.
21876,fun
21877,Amazing Game
21878,Pleaseeee
21879,war gud
21880,"I like the logistics more than anything else, combat is annoying and illogical, I still see why people like the game though."
21881,funnnn
21882,"Definitely quite the learning curve, however once you've got it down it's super fun and engaging!"
21883,cool
21884,one of my favourite games 10/10
21885,Base game is pretty meh. Use mods. I'd recommend Nq and it's off spring
21886,"This game is a classic, with so much depth but so much reward. It is a blast to play with friends."
21887,i like it
21888,"complicated but not too random.  you can set the difficulty to keep it interesting
"
21889,"i have only made it 6 hours into this beautiful game, and i can tell that its amazing. from the game play to the historical accuracy, these games are truly masterpieces.  I will be playing for many more."
21890,"good game, but multiplayer over internet (which is the purpose of this game) is buggy as hell and you will spend more time on load screens than in game"
21891,It's awesome. I have lost a significant proportion of my life to this game. And I don't regret a thing.
21892,This is one of the best games of all time. It has a depth and quality that is unmatched by other games of any Genre
21893,Don't attack Ghandi
21894,Overall a good game
21895,Love this game but it's been $30 forever and it never goes on sale
21896,very addictive
21897,okay this game's a little fun
21898,Excellent turn based strategy game.  One of the best ever made.
21899,Good but I still enjoyed Civilization 1991 more.
21900,having played all prior versions exept 4 this is worthy follower to a great line
21901,Way better then the successor.
21902,yeah buddy
21903,takes a long time but great game
21904,its a game
21905,"Fun game (especially with friends), good Linux port."
21906,good
21907,Exactly what I want out of an RTS.
21908,The last good Civ game.
21909,wow. just wow.
21910,Good
21911,Favorite game ever
21912,Best game I've ever played
21913,I will love this game till the day I die!
21914,it is a great game
21915,It's fun and there are many ways to win
21916,Cool gaem
21917,good game
21918,"Best Replay value of any game i own.

Worth it's full price, so getting it on a sale is a big win. 

Do it."
21919,TOp tier
21920,Good game. Until multiplayer breaks. Then its not good.
21921,its aight
21922,A classic
21923,"great, classic"
21924,"By far my favorite game, and probably still my favorite civ game even with 6."
21925,"I've never found the base game of a Civilization game to be all that enthralling, but the lack of a modding community for this game really hurts it. I love the Earth Simulation mods for Civ 4 and those don't exist here. Meanwhile the game itself is hard to modify yourself. I just wasted 5 hours trying to get a map I built on World Builder app created specifically for this game to work. The fact that you can't get acheivements when playing with mods also defeats the purpose of a Civ game.  

Just play Civilization 4 instead (I haven't played Civ 6 and don't plan too)."
21926,"THIS GAME RULES
"
21927,i like very much yes thank u yes
21928,"It's Civ 5.  It's amazing.  It has unlimited replay value.  It has nice music and good graphics.  Top 5 most played games of all time for me personally.  Don't be discouraged if it seems overwhelming, the tutorial helps and you'll grasp it in no time!  Buy this game!!!"
21929,The civ franchise has always been a favorite of mine. I have been playing these games since I first played it on Super Nintendo. Recommend this to anyone who wants good turn-based strategy fun.
21930,solid strategy game
21931,knowledge
21932,Nice turns i like
21933,"great game. hours of entertainment
"
21934,"I always came back to Civilization V.  Thats really must have in library of everybody who likes turn-based strategy games. Civilization  - forever in my top together with Starcraft, Heroes 3 and Diablo 2. Nothing came close to this brilliant saga of Sid Meier."
21935,"SO MUCH FUN! And sort of addicting, so be careful?"
21936,Unpopular opinion: This is a very good game!
21937,The best game on the internet and even better with mods
21938,"This game is heroin. Don't buy it, but buy it."
21939,Civ 5 is the best to me. I love the graphics and the gameplay. I have played Civ 6 and like certain things (i.e. builder limits) and disliked others (road systems). Civ 5 is simple and pure.
21940,epic turn based strategy
21941,"Just one more turn :D Incredible game, many possibilities to play (I preferred to avoid war :D) but going full war is also possible (although you need to watch out for the economy)"
21942,very fun. really easy to pick up
21943,turn-based strategy genius
21944,Fantastic Game. :) better than 6 by miles
21945,"I've dumped hours upon hours into this game, and I gotta say, It's my second favorite game. Vanilla gameplay is classic and great, however, the immense amount of work and detail put into the workshop is a godsend for replayability, even surpassing that of vanilla by a landslide. I mod the absolute shit out of this game constantly, and I applaud those who work on the workshop mods because without them, I probably would've stopped playing a while ago once I knew everything about it."
21946,yesyes
21947,Panzer goes Knall
21948,the best
21949,"It's Civ 5, of course it's a good game!"
21950,Still one of my all-time favourites
21951,As an long time Civ fan. I approve :)
21952,"Its good, play! lol"
21953,"Mom, why are you up so la... early?"
21954,"Absolutely addictive. Best strategy game I've ever played, and I would certainly recommend this to anyone looking for an empire builder."
21955,so amazing
21956,better than civ 6
21957,I have known teachers that use this games as a reward for high achieving students in their class -- if you have any curiosity at all you will learn something about human history just by playing this game.
21958,This game is so much more enjoyable to play. You can see the terrain much more clearly. It isn't cartoonish. Easier to see both enemies and troops. 100% better UI than Civ 6
21959,"This is a great game for people that are into strategy- based games. It is one of my personal favorites as it allows you to start out with primal troops, and grow into new ages and new technologies."
21960,i like the game
21961,"Not sure if it's better than Civ 4, but it's nice."
21962,nn
21963,its fun
21964,h
21965,"A classic, worth the investment. Civ 5 definately the best update since Civ 2"
21966,Get this game.
21967,"Wonderful game for staying at home. Days fly past. Still my favourite of the Civ games, although I've come to appreciated VI, but this is less resource hungry, and only the barbarians and AI players scream, not the fans of my PC."
21968,shut the hell up again
21969,"game good
"
21970,Amazing
21971,Best game of all time
21972,cool
21973,Yes.
21974,some stuff kid
21975,multiplayer is fun and also plz fix mac and pc having to use legacy to play together
21976,.
21977,An amazing addition to the franchise
21978,very good game to fill your free time
21979,"This game is fun even for retards like me.  I have no idea whats going on 2 hours into the game but I still love playing it.

This is an excellent game for essentially anyone."
21980,Occupying Washington is fun
21981,pretty good
21982,"As of writing this review, I have recently cracked 1000 hours of playtime in Civ 5 - the first game where I've done so. My next most played game, at time of writing, has a mere 223 hours. Not even a quarter of the time that I've spent playing Civ.

Every game you play is different. It's incredibly deep. Each civilization you play as - across all expansions and DLC, there's 43 - has different unique abilities, units, buildings or improvements, and thus encourages a different strategy in every game. The game itself allows you to play with 12 civs, but mods allow up to all 43 civs to play on one enormous map.

The entire franchise regularly goes on sale. The ""complete"" edition usually hovers around the $50 mark, but I snagged it back in 2014 for a mere $16.49.

Best $16.49 I've ever spent. I can't recommend it enough. Just be aware that the game is basically virtual crack."
21983,Amazing 10/10
21984,Good
21985,"Awesome game! Definitely recommend to anyone who wants to play either by themselves, or even with a few friends."
21986,I basically grew up on this game and it got me into the strategy genre. This game is one of the best at what it does and is well worth its price.
21987,VERY GOOD
21988,"I took over korea, to make my ancestors proud!"
21989,good fun
21990,I have 420 hours in the game and as much as i love this game i just cant bring myself to play it. there is something about being able to to say you have 420hrs in civ. Also if you play this game without all the dlcs you dont deserve to walk this planet
21991,its alright
21992,"Just taking over countries, you know me."
21993,"Amazing, the hours just tick by, especially when playing with friends!"
21994,Quality World Domination
21995,Please give me back my life.
21996,Big fan of Civ games
21997,great game
21998,I've been a fan of strategy games for 45 years.  This one lets you vary the map and the game.  Always different.
21999,I think I'm starting to get the hang of it.
22000,Gandhi nuked me :(
22001,Bring back Mac and PC crossplay please. This is make or break for many players
22002,I love this game and it's a blast over all playing with friends but the servers are absolute poo. Constantly getting kicked and losing connection. Makes the game unplayable after 70 turns or so. I guess it's a good way to force people to buy the new one.
22003,nice
22004,its so fun and good
22005,lk
22006,fuck
22007,"""Oh shit it's 4am! I need to go to bed... after this turn.""

22008,its good i guess
22009,"Fun
"
22010,this game reminds me of civ 5
22011,"It's a good passtime, I'd say. I've played 950ish hours and enjoyed most of it. It's a good game, and my friends and I used to play it quite often, when we had the time. It is really good in terms of strategy and all-round fun. It's quite entertaining too to get an alert notifying you that the Great Wall of China has been built in Amsterdam or some other such locality XD."
22012,gr8
22013,"Great game, only game I've ever player that I dont get sick of from playing over and over. Each gameplay is different from the last. Hope this comes to the Switch like VI has."
22014,phenomenal strategy game
22015,You can learn something every time you play this game!
22016,lot of content especially after brave world dlc
22017,this game is so easy to get lost in
22018,we decided to remove crossplay between mac and windows users 4 months ago for a 64 bit version of a game that worked on macs previously XD
22019,"you think you can crossplay on mac without kissing my cock?

hahaha

you're dead wrong."
22020,this game
22021,very nice
22022,"its decent
"
22023,Straight up crack.
22024,"I like this version of Civ because it doesn't dwell too deeply into church related mumbo jumbo, but does have fairly complex civilizations to contend with.
Trade could be improved, and sometimes resources seem a bit limited, but I still enjoy playing."
22025,Fun Fun Fun
22026,.
22027,best civ ever
22028,because its a good game and sometimes super cheap
22029,yummy
22030,Fuck yes!
22031,"Very time consuming...
It is a great game with a lot of features.
Admirable citations and just a ton of strategy."
22032,One of my all time favorite games with  endless variation and difficulties.
22033,good game

22050,great game!
22051,best game 10/10
22052,"I'm very late to the party with Civ, but if you're like me... give it a go!! Lots of playtime for your money :D"
22053,I'll post a review after I just finish this next turn
22054,Great game better than VI
22055,"ah yes, gemnomcide"
22056,nice long term strategy game.
22057,Aika wörtti
22058,"Definitely better with DLC, but still fun without. This game is the ultimate time killer, especially as it can be played without an internet connection."
22059,"Even without the DLCs, this game is a great turn based strategy game"
22060,"I am a Civilization fan and have been for many years. I started with the first Civilization and have followed the series until Civ6 and my favourite is Civilization V, without any DLC's since I do not like the religion and the new trading mechanism of the caravans etc.
Civ-V is a fun game that might take some time to get into but after watching any of the available videos on Youtube you will for sure get the hang of it and enjoy it, if this is your type of game genre...

Civ-V has finally got hexagon ""game-squares"" which is more enjoyable than the previous squares and now only one fighting unit can be per square, which eliminates surprise attacks where the enemy has 50 army guys on a single square, which makes the game more fair.

This game is almost perfect, apart from some performance issues later on in the game, when you have many automated workers running around a large map, that can take annoyingly long time for the turn to proceed.

I hope you will enjoy this game as much as I have.

P.s. I seriously dislike Civ-6 and all what it offers..."
22061,its a great game
22062,++
22063,Is what it is. I'm a fan of Civ so I enjoyed it.
22064,Good game to the brain active while staying at home avoiding Covid 19
22065,"played a little bit, pretty good 
"
22066,"Probably the best and most enduring title I have ever played on PC. I would definitely recommend the game to anyone, even those not that interested in strategy games. 10/10"
22067,Civilization is the best Turn-based strategy game ever made (with X-Com being a close second) and  Turn-based strategy games are the best strategy games and Civilization V is the best Civilization ever made. None of the cartoon graphics of the games that followed it and none of the - needlessly - complex game mechanics. I really don't know what else to say about this game. It is The Beatles equivalent of the Turn-based strategy games.
22068,"When playing game with online Human vs AI, bug when loading a game. Always."
22069,just play it noob
22070,its good
22071,Good game
22072,"Great game, if you can put up with all the crashes, and reloads/restarts,etc; and there are no fixes for that problem. Believe me I tried."
22073,"Negatives
-character models can range from okay (Ghandhi, Napoleon) to sleep paralysis demon (Catherine, Wu Zeitan)
-The DLC can be pretty pricy
Positives
- Littterally everything else
>Gameplay is fun and addicting
>Music is nice
>Not too confusing(Easy stratergy game to play)
>Tons of content even without the DLC"
22074,Have a been a fan of the CIV games for years with CIV V being an absolute fav. Great strategy game!
22075,fuck ghandi
22076,it will eat your life away
22077,I play Civilization from Civ 1 and i have still so much fun :-) priceless
22078,"This game stands the test of time. After 10 years it's still great and every game is a different experience. If you're gonna sink a bunch of hours in a strategy game, this is a good one."
22079,good
22080,Fun!
22081,Classic Civ
22082,A relaxing game I accidentally spend 6 hours straight playing.
22083,It's fun but it uses so much of my CPU on my Macbook Pro. It drives the fans crazy and heats up my laptop like no other.
22084,"simple, easy to play"
22085,"Good game, though I recommend fanmade balancing patches like NQ or Takmod"
22086,This is an awesome strategy game.
22087,you can bully people
22088,"I always thought the jokes about playing Civ and not noticing the time passing by was just a joke. This is the first Civ game I've played. Oh boy, was I wrong."
22089,super Fun!
22090,"Trying to play between Mac and PC seems to be impossible. Game keeps crashing after multiplayer load screen. We spent about two hours searching online forums and various technical workarounds to figure out a fix for this issue. No idea where to go and there is very little direction online, let alone from the manufacturer, on how to resolve this issue."
22091,b
22092,"its okay, could be better."
22093,"good game

22094,Awesome game! Controls are intuitive and it is so satisfying!!!

22097,10/10
22098,Video ame
22099,It is a hit or miss if you download the game whether it will play or not. Cannot get past the launcher. I cannot endorse this game. Waste of time...
22100,"I like the intellectual and strategic challenge.  I like the computer taking me to another piece that can move when I finish my move.  I hate that it jumps to a different theatre while I'm fighting a battle.  I dislike the lack of information on points i.e. What makes the values (gold, happiness, etc.) change when I do nothing but hit next turn."
22101,I found this game from a friend and its one of the best RTS's out there the newer civs does not compare
22102,"awesome awesome awesome
"
22103,One of the best games I have ever played. Just have patience and watch a lot of youtube tutorials.

22125,I can play as ghandi
22126,Game is starting to suffer from the same problem as Civ VI.  Won;t close cleanly.
22127,Just adding to the Review.
22128,The BEST Civ version yet !   Keeps you involved in more aspects of the growing civ....
22129, rrg
22130,"civ 5 is a great game, it was my first introduction into civ and really what got me into strategy as a whole, its a shame civ 6 did not take more concepts from civ 5, this game really is great"
22131,"WIth the dlc added it becomes an amazing game, the civs alone providing a ridiculous amount of replayability.
Heartily recommended!"
22132,I ain't good at writing reviews that much so I may edit it some time in the future. For now I'll just write that it's really worth buying even tho it's kinda overpriced.
22133,sick

22141,Civ V is a game I play with Friends
22142,"Great game, a game that will stand the test of time"
22143,"It is a great and time consuming game, great strategy and history based game! 5/5 stars!"
22144,"Tried to go for a peaceful cultural victory and then a fellow leader decided to surprise me with war, so I nuked his cities and then burned them to the ground. I got my peaceful cultural victory. 10/10 would go with peace again."
22145,ye es gud
22146,"Pro tip, attack your friends before turn 75. They will be so crippled after you burn a few cities you win
5/5"
22147,"A wonderful and fun time dump - both with friends and in single player. It's a wonderful take on a historic, strategic, turn-based game. Definitely top of its game tier."
22148,Fantastic game spent countless hours with friends with hectic moments and several hours of silence perfect game during quarantine

22153,Great game. Great job. Keep up the good work. Hi Tyrone and Preston
22154,Very great game to waste time during self-isolation with friends. 10/10 Would not play unless I wanted to waste a FUCK ton of time.
22155,That good Civ
22156,contant crashes and glitches that should be fixed in multyplayer also bring civ2 gold to steam please
22157,"good
"
22158,A classic in the 4X genre which still continues to impress.
22159,"Fantastic turn-based strategy game. Steep learning curve which I am struggling with, but that's exactly what the game promised."
22160,"My favorite Civ game. Super easy to understand, but hard to master. Runs great. I recommend gettting all the DLC for the full experiance."
22161,"Really good game if you like settlers of cataan,"
22162,WAY better than Civ 6
22163,good game
22164,Excellent game.
22165,"Having only gotten into Civ 5 and Civ 6 simultaneously 2 years ago, I cannot draw a comparison to their predecessors.

I didn't play PC games growing up however I was always around friends that played Starcraft and other sci-fi or fantasy RTS. As someone interested in history, I had wondered if there was a game out there that captured the human spirit through the years. I'm glad I found the Civilization franchise. It has its pitfalls such as poor late game unit and city management, and some wonky AI ticks but overall it is very elegant and fun. The quotes and narrating as you progress through the tech tree are on another level compared to Civ 6. I also prefer the art direction of Civ 5. Highly recommended— go out and 4x to your heart's desire.

22166,it is good
22167,I mean its just a fun game.
22168,THIS GAME IS A NICE GAME AND IT IS FUN TO PLAY WITH FUN
22169,Great strategy game for a beginner that wants to get into grand strategy games. Not an insane amount of depth and a very helpful civilopedia for you to learn everything you need to know.
22170,Best strategy game ever made. Refined and smooth.
22171,"Its a great game to be played over and over again as you have so many different leaders and CIVs with different characteristics and abilities. As well as different win senarios, some being harder to achieve with certain CIVs than others. Super addicting to just keep playing 1 more turn! Hard to not play for at least 3 hours a sitting..."
22172,Fun Fun nation die friend ragequit
22173,it is fun
22174,This game made me a genius
22175,"I own all the civilizations 1-5.  Big fan, love it.  Don't like the unit limitations in this one or the 'steam login to play' crap.  But I can understand its purpose."
22176,It's a great way to keep up with the boys.
22177,Best Turn based game ever made
22178,Civilization! A Classic!
22179,best game ever
22180,"Hexes are a massive improvement over the grid, and no more death stacking makes combat far more interesting. Unfortunately the AI is still incredibly stupid in its efforts to move units."
22181,THIS GAME USE TO HAVE A NICE CHEAT CODE FOR MORE MONEY AND RESOURCES FOR THOSE WHO JUST WANTED TO GAME AND MAKE SCENES WITHOUT ALL THE GRINDING AND NOW I CANT FIND THOSE CODES. SO IT SUCKS. YEAH I PLAYED IT WITHOUT CHEATS AND BEAT IT BUT I WANT THE CHEATS. I LIKE THE FAST PACE AND I LIKE THE ABILITY TO MAKE HUGE ARMIES AND TAKE OVER HUGE MAPS. ITS A VIDEO GAME IM NOT PLAYING PVP. I KIND OF WANT MY MONEY BACK BECASUE WITHOUT THE CHEATS ITS A SHITTY GAME JUST ANYOTHER RTS. ALL THE LOSERS LIKE WHY DO YOU NEED CHEATS because its way funner if your just looking for a quick victory dumby ! all thier whining effecting my game play i will never play another civilization game again because the cheats made the quik play fun. i hate grinding unless im looking for that kind of slugish play. i want my cheats! i would burn tis game if it didnt mean burning my hardrive. CIVILIZATION V SUCKS!!!! WORST 10$ IVE SPENT IN A WHILE

22191,"just the worst, I'd recommend 10/10"
22192,"Very addictive and enjoyable, would highly recommend for people who enjoy strategy games and world domination."
22193,Civ 5 is one of the best multiplayer games Ive ever played.

22216,Much better combat than Civ IV.
22217,Good game
22218,gud game ez pz
22219,its a turn based game
22220,The Civ series is unquestionably the best for when you're tired of all the other games. You can play at whatever attention level you choose. You can walk away when someone comes to the door or it's time to fix a sandwich and jump right back in without missing a beat. You can challenge yourself or play casually and it's a different game every time.
22221,Turns will roll over automatically if no action is required of the player.
22222,great game
22223,"Civilization V is one of the best turn-based strategy games I’ve ever had the pleasure of playing. Whether teaming up with my friends for some multiplayer, or simply losing a whole night of sleep to the game’s endlessly replayable single player, this is one game that any strategy enthusiast, or, hell anyone strat-curious should check out. Sure, I miss some of the deeper inter-civilization relations that the more defined religion and government setup brought in Civilization IV, but that’s nothing anyone new to the series will even think twice about. With all the tips, advisers and tools in place, this is the first Civilization for PC that I feel is worth just about every person’s time. Go forth and create, subdue, and exploit. Do as Firaxis has done, and bring Civilization to the masses."
22224,Ghandi nukes
22225,"125 hours, still haven't finished 1 full game. Highly recommended"
22226,"1,324 hours of playtime."
22227,Amazing game to procrastinate from doing work
22228,My Love
22229,"I've sunk over 350 hours into this game. I find it's a great way to catch up with friends, spend a long weekend with my wife, and it's just chill. Turn based keeps the pace from getting too out of hand though when PVP wars kick off it can get a little wonky."
22230,bruh time just flies
22231,Just one more turn...
22232,I purchased only a couple of the Civ. games and each one has given me many hours of entertainment. Great strategy titles for those into the genre.

I'm guessing that's a positive thing?"
22238,"FPS's usually aren't my favorite, but this really hit the spot"
22239,Best Civ game I've played
22240,I cant play with my friend thats not on a mac anymore. WTF
22241,"If you like the feeling of crushing hard work and dedication, this is the game for you."
22242,Booooooooo!
22243,"Been playing this game since I was little, I may not have known what I was doing but I always had fun and have fond memories of this game growing up. I'm glad I got this game recently with all the DLC and I'm ready to sink more and more hours into this game"

22271,This game is a drug. Do not touch! This game is the kind of thing there should be warnings taught to kids about in school. You will think just one more turn... one more turn.. wondering when the next Civilization annoymous meeting will be in your local church. Actually make that a Pagoda :) +2 Happiness

22282,The Classic
22283,"One of the best games of all time. Combines strategy with a turn based action that keeps the feel of a diplomatic simulator. The historical, scientific and artistic references and quotes are just an added bonus on top of an already outstanding game. 11/10, legendary"
22284,It looks better than civ beyond earth and civ 6. It's also harder than civ 6 but not to the point of annoying like civ beyond earth. The perfect online strategy board game.
22285,"ghandi nukes all your cities, gg would be nuked again"
22286,"Good strategy game, aged but still enjoyable"
22287,yes
22288,It is a game with remarkable level of depth. It's a great game to play with friends who too share your fancy in strategy games.
22289,"I love all of the Civilization Game Titles. This one ranks high in re-playability because  of the scenarios and ability to create custom game conditions, but also because it doesn't take up as much of a computer/laptop's processing and disk, unlike the later versions of the game. So you can still get a decent in-game experience on mid-grade computer systems that aren't specifically designed for gaming."
22290,It's fun.
22291,Every game is different even if you don't change any variables from one game to the next.
22292,extremely good
22293,i recommended it to my girlfriend
22294,Just plain love it
22295,"I really like the game, and more than 1000 hrs says it all"

22297,"I will start with a warning: this game is designed to get you addicted and keep you playing. I was trying to keep a decent sleep schedule during the covid-19 quarantine, but then I stayed up until 4 am chasing a science victory instead of going to bed at midnight (I said ""decent"" sleep schedule, not ""functional adult""). But I enjoyed it, and now I'm back with coffee in hand for my next civ fix. You will lose hours in this game, but if you're like me, you won't mind all that much. After all, is there really such a thing as a greater purpose in life, or are we all just worker units spawned by an indifferent AI?"
22298,"Civ 5 has got to be one of the best in the series in my opinion. Not as good as Civ 4, but I tend to gravitate towards this one more often than any other in the series. Why? Two main reasons:

1. The modding community.
There's tons of mods that work very well. Leaders, scenarios, quality of life improvements, etc. Installing them is super easy due to Steam Workshop support.

2. The combat.
I may be a minority in this, but for the first time in the series I find myself actually enjoying the combat and feeling that it's finally ""fair."" As fans of the series may know, the combat was improved in 4 so outcomes weren't so random. However, Civ 5 gets rid of ""unit stacking"" which is, admittedly, a double edged sword. Sure, it's annoying to get blocked by you or your ally's units on a space, but this works very good for combat and becomes chess-like so you're no longer blindsided by a stack of units that only appeared as a single marine.

Some minor grievances. Auto improvements seem to be scaled back and/or nonexistent from Civ 4. Some prefer manual improvements because it means you're actually *playing* the game, but having to micromanage some worker actions during a war is kind of annoying. Another minor issue is that the tech tree seems to have been simplified, perhaps a little too much from 4.

Regardless, it's worth buying this game and all its expansions just to have access to the mods!"

22355,"I have far beyond 3000 hours on Civ V and maybe around 15000+ on the entire Civ franchise. That game is amazing in so many ways. One must buy and play it before he passes away! :)

If you do not tailor your strategy to the specific civilization and to the initial terrain you have been given, then you will lose the game at its very beginning, You can curve your way in a cunning way but the A.I. is clever so you always have a challenging path until the end. That is why I always come back for some more... and for one more turn.

One more turn till I die!"

22370,its not everyones cup of tea but if you like strategy games then yes
22371,"Boy have I sunk a lot of hours into this game. I don't even feel close to being done with it yet...

It is pretty absurd how much you can do with this game of Civ. It might be the new gold standard Civ game, replacing Civ II, but I know soooooooo many people will debate me on that. Civ II is still great, but I've never encountered a Civ game I didn't like.

After playing so many hours of this game, I think the only way I'd improve the game is to add another civ or two, maybe add some like ""natural disaster"" type stuff, or weird ""apocalypse"" stuff that they do in Stellaris. Or add more complex diplomacy stuff (like Stellaris). I dunno. I'm not saying Stellaris is a better game here. It's really a different beast. But I do think that what Stellaris brings to the table will be hugely influential on future Civ games (I haven't played Civ VI yet, but I don't think the diplomacy is as complex as what Stellaris offers).

But seriously folks... Civ V is incredible. It is 100% essential if you're a strategy fan, and that much more essential if turn-based is your main bag.

What might be the best thing about Civ V (and probably Civ as a franchise), is when you're playing the long game and the RPG elements really start making themselves known. At least, that's how it is for me. Man, I was playing on this Africa map once, and I set it up so it would be a little crowded, ensuring that there would be some stiff competition for resources and fun trade. This game was freaking ridiculous. I was playing as France, and I started up in the Egypt area. Over the centuries that passed in the game, a couple civs got wiped out, and it came down to me and Montezuma as the two dominant powers. We were like USA and Russia in the Cold War, it was NUTS. They were down on the southern part of the continent, so we weren't close enough to have a real war, but boy the threats were FLYING towards the end of it. I had the most sobering moment playing this when Montezuma told me, somewhat unprompted, ""We are not afraid to use nuclear weapons!"" I'd been playing for a couple days by that point, and I was in the middle of a session for a couple hours. I was beside myself. Can you imagine being a world leader in a pissing match with a warmongering psycho, and he calls you just to tell you that? YIKES. And in THIS political climate?? Woof.

Anyway do whatever you have to do to get this game if you're thinking about it. If you're into strategy games and on the fence about getting this, you have to make the plunge. This game slaps."
22372,Turn based - no thanks - prefer Age of Empires....

22382,"Once you learn the controls, its relatively easy to play."
22383,Simple good fun
22384,A wonderful (wonder-full?) turn-based strategy game and an excellent compliment to the Sid Meier's Civilization series. Definitely worth the hours of gameplay!

22387,its fun
22388,"I could say an awful lot about this game, but it'd all be pretty wasteful of me. I'm not particularly good at RTS's, and I'm really more of an XCOM fan these days? But these game has always been there for me, and friends of mine as a reliable, fun sim to play. I don't think you can find a better place to start than here. Do some research, see what version appeals to you, but I think this game won't be topped for a long time."

22407,"Compared to other strategy games it's pretty basic, but if you make one early-game mistake it can take a few hours for it to penalise you.
Also, you can get royally screwed over late-game by lack of military resources, which you cannot recover from if you're playing with non-AI.
All in all, not my cup of tea.

Oh, yeah, and there are bugs everywhere + the network code is garbage"
22408,"Sid Meier's Civilization V is a fun way to pass time, exercise the mind, and learn about history.  Civ5 is turn-based, so players can take their time and play at a leisurely pace.  Civ5 is among my favorite strategy games for technology, policy, diplomacy, exploration, and economy.  I do not find the combat system very exciting in Civ5.  I recommend this game for single player mode, but not multiplayer.  There are many bugs in Civ5 online multiplayer games.  Players are frequently dropped from the online game and the online games often crash.  These same bugs occur when playing with friends on a local area network, so the problem is not unique to internet play.  I hope developers eventually fix the bugs in multiplayer, but I am not counting on major updates, since the game has already been around for so long."

We know we won't stop until we have conquered Istanbul and renamed it as Constantinople, until we have successfully deployed the Polish cavalry against the German panzer units, until our French infantry triumphs on the frozen steppes of Russia, until we've discovered Spanish soil with our Iroquois ships, and lest we forget: until we have vaporised all of Ghandi's cities with our nuclear arsenal.

Time waits for no one, history less so.
We will not stop.
We will continue... just... one... more... turn..."

22416,"Can't stop.
Won't stop."
22417,"Good game, hours speak for themselves."
22418,"It's been like 10 years since its been released and I still play it on occasion with my friends. While Civilization 6 has some cool points for combat mechanics like the Army, in Civ5 at least religion can be avoided from being as OP by disabling it. Although, Piety and Rationalism are pretty imbalanced when faith is involved, the Vanilla and the version of the game without Gods and Kings is pretty fun. But that's just my take and I've been playing since Civilization 3. The netcode kinda sucks but it's playable, and you can rejoin games you've disconnected from for whatever reason. There is no official support for modded gameplay which is a bit of a downer if you're a person trying to play by disabling the Piety and Rationalism tree. But all in all, it's pretty fun still 10 years later. 

7/10 - It has its known issues but it's pretty fun still. One can only hope that Civilization 7 will be better than 6 and 5 though in the same way we hoped that Civilization 5 would be much better than 4 and it turned out to be so"
22419,good

22425,Good Stuff
22426,good game
22427,just one more turn......
22428,Very enjoyable.
22429,"I have way too many hours invested in this game, really...its sad. But I would say those hours weren't wasted. This is one of the best civ builder games to date. You could get lost for hours in the tempting eyes of Gandhi or Khan. But the multiplayer is really fun, the single player is hands down my favorite, and each DLC makes the game feel new again...However I must say that ya'll should get this game in a sale, since the price is a little too high for my taste. Especially since there are some game-breaking bugs. Oh yeah did I forget about the bugs...oof. Do NOT get this game without the, ""Brave New World"" DLC or all the DLC combined; if not you will regret it. The bug with the builders CANNOT be ignored. The bug goes like this: When you make a builder and its over turn 65 you have a high possibility that that builder will become ""corrupted"" and you as the player must make him repeat every action he does, again and again and again (no automation allowed). This becomes super tedious and makes the game not only drag on for way too long but it drives you insane. The only way to bypass this evil horrendous demon-esc bug is to buy your way through the paywall that is all of the DLC.

In conclusion, do buy this game but only with all the DLC while its on sale. It's a sacrifice but totally worth all those glorious hours dumped in. Add this baby to your wishlist guys ;)"
22430,i have no idea what i'm doing and i still find it fun af
22431,"very well made and enjoyable,"
22432,"Not as good as EMPIRE but enjoyable enough to kill time.  Does not have the ability to set the start and end eras for a game as in EMPIRE.  Several units have non-sensical capabilities, e.g., bombers can attack helicopters, anti-aircraft guns inflict inordinate damage to ground units but are surprisingly ineffective against air targets.  Would be nice to incorporate the ability to create minefields on land and water spaces.   Would be nice to be able to request (pay) an AI ally to perform certain functions, e.g., guard an area or attack a particular target.  Presently the AI ally units seem to just make random movements with no coordination and remains very close to its own land spaces.  Workers placed on automatic build do the stupidest things like cross the map to build something when a different improvement is far closer.  Citadels should not be limited to building only in spaces contiguous to present territory.  There should be a capability to recon an area other than spies and scouts, e.g., balloons and dirigibles that loiter (Civil War to WW 2 periods) and spy planes and UAVs (Modern era and after)."
22433,"bad game to play with james, hes a cunt."
22434,The AI are all assholes and the UI is pretty glitchy. Maybe forgivable if not for the massive time investment a game represents. Try something fun instead.

I find the tourism and great works of art sections a bit strange to get my head around. I might like it once I've gotten my head around it, but it's not as intuitive and entertaining as the base game."

22486,I've managed to keep myself entertained through a deployment and months glued to a couch with a broken leg because of this game. Somehow it never gets old and I keep coming back to it.
22487,"An excellent game, that I've kept coming back to for years.  It took me a while to get used to 4X-style games, but once I did I enjoyed this greatly.

NOTE: Linux users will not be able to play multiplayer.  Aspyr hasn't updated the game since who knows when, and probably never will again.  It does not appear to work under Proton 5.0, either."
22488,I have about 500 hours in this and keep coming back. Even a decade on (that long? wow!) I struggle to find a more-modern game that blends the different elements of TBS more effectively.

22512,Unpopular opinion: Minimal Fog Of War Setting with blackness instead of clouds looks better.

"
22534,good game
22535,Easy to learn and still complex enough so it's fun
22536,"fun game played again after long hiatus just went with the flow and picked it up again as i went
"
22537,Addictive and fun!r
22538,Absolutely brilliant! To anyone who like strategy games this is probably the best!!
22539,the best part is when you kill a primitive warrior with a nuclear-powered giant mech robot
22540,it is so much fun with mods
22541,Great game.
22542,This is the best Civilization building game on the market no question.
22543,"I really want to like it but I am left speechless. The fact that I have booted it up 20+ times in five years, and uninstalled it as many times, just shows how much I wanted to like it. I was a big fan of III and IV. This one is just so boring."
22544,"Better than civ 6,  feels more refined"
22545,Great Game!
22546,I've played this much and i still suck...
22547,Classic. Best of the series.
22548,Just a good game overall
22549,Never gets old this game. Still exploring countless possibilities of playing this game.
22550,its civ. what do u need to know?
22551,It's Civ. It's great.
22552,Taught me more about international relations than my MSc degree..........
22553,banan
22554,GOOD!
22555,This is the best. IR that never happen in reality always happen in this game.
22556,One of my favorites. Not too hardcore but not too casual. I have been playing for years and still don't feel like moving on. ;)
22557,.
22558,Wait to buy for $13 with all DLC on sale. Good investment.
22559,"It's OK, I guess"
22560,The series is amazing. I fell in love with this game as a young man and I still get enjoyment from it. Its a fantastic strategy game.
22561,Didn't play the CIV6 but this one's pretty OK
22562,fun
22563,great style
22564,I've played 308 hours of this thing. Steam really still needs to ask me if I'd recommend this to a friend? Wow.
22565,good
22566,pretty good
22567,AMAZIN
22568,E
22569,"There is no better way to some up civ than ""just one more turn..."""
22570,"Great game, lots of fun. Ton of options for game play makes it very customizable to fit anyone skill level or play style."
22571,"Great, just as civ should be."
22572,careful not to accidentally play this one for eight hours straight without realizing it. pretty fun
22573,"Fun, productive game to play not just by yourself, but especially with a good group of friends :)"
22574,Why did they get rid of cross-platform (PC-Mac) gameplay like 9 years after the release?
22575,Good game before sleep Kappa
22576,"Great game, best game"
22577,is gud juss be smart
22578,"good game, I like it.  I wish they didnt ruin VI with those awful graphics and animation but V is solid"
22579,"One of the best games I've played in a long time. If you're wondering which CIV you should get, I would recommend either 5 or 6, but I would get 5 before I'd get 6."
22580,"gud game
"
22581,Bu oyunu oynamayan maldır
22582,"Wowzers. And honestly, my reaction to this entire game! LOVE LOVE LOVE! The graphics of this game don't hold up to the new one for sure, and honestly, this knocks down the review a couple points. I have passed up sex multiple times for this video game, and i'd do it all again in a hearbeat! The combat system is pretty ingenious and something you'd never find in any action game ever, only the Sid Meier's Civilization series. Overall, I would recommend for anyone looking for a new game to pass the time! 6.8/10"
22583,its ok i guess
22584,better than civ6
22585,yee boi
22586,good game
22587,"good game, love when I make the world worship Jim Crow Laws as Washington"
22588,"This game is great, but Online sucks. It's super glitchy and I had to stop a game I was winning on multiplayer because my end of turn was bugged and I never could click the next turn."
22589,"Beware, the time sink is unimaginable. Steams logging of my hours isn't 1/100th."
22590,classic
22591,A great place for imagination to flow. Always fun to build up a civilization and guide how you can lead it to dominance. You can keep a casual play to just be creative or full on strategy to keep your skills sharp. Certainly in the top 3 games I've ever played.
22592,it good
22593,It's fun
22594,"Don't settle near me or ill declare war, I swear on judaism."
22595,"good ennit
"
22596,"Excellent strategy game, wonderful way to spend a day, it is easy to lose track of time. I've spent years on this game. Forgot I even had a family and friends. 10/10 would recommend"
22597,great fun game
22598,a
22599,"This game is a psychological experiment on society. The 'one more turn' mentality is exactly what the government intended.

10/10 would be indoctrinated again."
22600,Great game!
22601,rome will rise again
22602,this game is fun when you play with people you can chill with it gets a lot better with the nq mode asswell
22603,Great strategy game with tons of nuances. Easy to lose 3-5 hours on this without realizing.
22604,pretty dope
22605,v good v fun
22606,v good game for sissy cucks
22607,coronavirus gamer time uwu
22608,this is a non newb game
22609,"Civilization is one of he best PC games ever made, a true classic. Turn based and complex enough to make you feel that you could have done better, making you want to come back for more. Always exciting to discover what comes next in the game.
Enjoy!"
22610,fun
22611,"It's a good game.
Recommended to get the complete edition."
22612,just wow. better than civ 6. you should really try it out
22613,"I mean

It's civ 5

What more need be said? 

I played this game like 60 hours last week. I have no self-control and this is awesome."
22614,"fab!
"
22615,It's good. A little too simple for my taste but it's arguably the best introduction to strategy games out there. Plenty of settings let you customize your game to your liking and there are tons of civilizations (if you buy the DLC; just get it all on sale for cheap). It is especially fun with a few friends. I'd give it a 6/7 if I hadn't found other strategy games I prefered; now I'd probably give it a 5/7. Fun with flaws.
22616,Fuck Diplomacy
22617,Will leave a full review once i finish a game
22618,Connection issues worse than the connection with my parents
22619,simple game with enough nuances for the more adept gamer
22620,Faster than Civ VI but not such pretty graphics.
22621,OSX Bugs galore. Mouse won't alight correctly on the screen making it impossible to play. This used to be fine.
22622,+1
22623,aight
22624,
22625,its good
22626,Vewy good
22627,"good strategic game that could last for days, from the stone ages to the atomic age
"
22628,best CIv Game...it's very beautifull with friends.
22629,"Togehter with CivIV, one of the greatest games of this genre of all times."
22630,its ok
22631,yep
22632,Fuck you you gajy cunts. fix the multiplayer before I scream
22633,decent
22634,Yeah its fun.
22635,yes
22636,"A great game. I have all the civs except #6, and of them i think this one is the best."
22637,A good game.
22638,Awesome game!
22639,"i love this game, its awesome"
22640,Good but long.
22641,Nice.
22642,yes.
22643,"I was excited to play CIV again! After all this time. Now in 2020 we have COVID 19 brothers. I thought to myself.. Man I should just buy the new CIV game out today. Since this one is 10 years old!!! 
Lucky me CIV 6 (Newest Civ game currently out) is 4 years fucking old and still box price at $60 in these tough times. 
ARE YOU OUT OF YOUR FUCKING MIND????????????????????????????????????? 
OKAY THEN ILL ASK MY BUDDIES TO GET CIV5 THAT CAN'T BE THAT MUCH!! 
ITS FUCKIN $30 AND 10 YEARS OLD. 
THIS MUST BE THE BEST AGING GAME IN THE HISTORY OF GAMES.

F U C KKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKK"
22644,"Civilization V was the first truly great Sid Meier's Civilization game.

There, I said it.

Civilization V plays faster than its predecessors by paring combat to its essentials; rather than fielding vast stacks of soldiers, combat takes place on the hex-based world map that reminds me of Fallout. Funding armies is expensive both in terms of time to build and in funds to keep them active each turn. Each encounter, then, becomes an active choice -- and you are rewarded for planning it, with bonuses for flanking, terrain, technologies, policy, and yes, innate civiization bonuses.

It is so freaking good.

It is nearly endlessly replayable, and the built-in modding support elevates this game to Godhood. The complete edition routinely goes on sale.

I return to Civilization V time and time again, despite owning its successor.

---

i have routinely bested my friends in this, as they flail about, while i hide behind pallisades, sipping mimosas, satisfied to wait for the perfect opening.

 buy this already, you nerds"
22645,One of the greatest versions of the greatest game ever made! Go forth and conquer!
22646,its a favorite of mine
22647,Very fun game. Fun by yourself and with friends.
22648,don't play after 8pm as suddenly it will be 5am
22649,This game is a time machine. You're always suddenly in the future and have missed 4 hours of sleep. Get you through a quarantine real good.
22650,One of the best games I have ever played
22651,Great game.
22652,If it werent for the payable DLC this game would be the awesomest. Instead its only great
22653,good
22654,"This game just keeps on coming.  You really will want to play ""just one more turn..."""
22655,artemis bro
22656,Super game
22657,"It is very very fun but, not too easy."
22658,
22659,nice
22660,"As a lifelong fan of the Civilization franchise, I was skeptical of this release but it has finally turned out to be among the best of them.  I think it's safe to say this is the ultimate example of the ""4X"" genre. It is games within games, all tied together with endless replayability."
22661,I've played all civ games including the 6th one and except for the 4th one (the third was so bad for me that I skipped the next in the series. I feel civ 5 is the best. Civ 6 took the wrong direction in art and in making the game harder to mod. Civ 5 is because of the modding.
22662,Ghandi has nukes what more could ask for.
22663,good game
22664,"Great game, detailed and absorbing world building, as hostile or collaborative and as tough as you want to make it!"
22665,The legendary SM Civ. What else to say?
22666,"I'm now playing my 4th or 5th campaign on King difficulty. Each time I become the wiser, and each time the computer pulls out a new trick. The more I understand this game, the more enjoyable it becomes. I am loving it -- and this is from someone who put 550 hours into Empire: Total War.

Only complaint is that the game crashes every time I try to liberate a city back to its rightful owner. This appears to be a known bug on Mac."
22667,Wonderful game and even better than CIV VI.
22668,I LUV IT
22669,"Just one more turn, If you dont like style of this game GB you!! Run away from this thing."
22670,"Best Civ till now, 28.03.2020"
22671,me like civ 5
22672,Best game
22673,good game
22674,cool
22675,Crashes continually.
22676,
22677,Earlier in the week I re-installed Civ 5 after not touching it for 3 years and I played for 48 hours in 4 days. I'm uninstalling it for my health.
22678,8/10
22679,It's fun!
22680,A great game to play during quarentine
22681,very goog tactical tingz
22682,"trust me when I say mods make this game really really fun

"
22683,Great game to dump hours into and forget you had homework.
22684,addicting
22685,yeahh
22686,"Legendary game with great strategy, many possible outcomes, the ability to completely destroy you mentally as you watch the last of your 26 cities burnt away slowly by Genghis Khan after 18 hours, and finally the ability to ruin any hope of normal life because of excessive sleep deprivation. So all in all fantastic game 10/10 would recommend."
22687,dis game gud
22688,Best game for killing time!
22689,awesome love it great stuff thanks
22690,"This game can be addicting, and fun to boot. I love the abundance of mods which are available for this game via the Workshop, and I use them daily. Or, if you prefer playing without mods, the game can be challenging on its own."
22691,its good
22692,very yummy
22693,It's fun.
22694,Great game for anyone who is into strategy and tactics.
22695,"Não sei quem é o Sid nem o Meyers, mas o jogo ta bom, parabens para eles."
22696,civ 5 is good
22697,Auto pilot game of the god damned century

22713,I love Civ!! Its a great strategy game.
22714,Runs slow and poor after ~200 turns but still the best Civ game without a doubt.

22730,Classic.. Timeless.. My Rock
22731,fun game to play with friends. great modding community.
22732,"Really enjoyable game. Best with the DLCS.  good alone, and best with friends."
22733,Still better than civ 6 in my opinion
22734,Bazen bilgisayarınız kaldırmaz ve siz de oyunu silersiniz.
22735,"I've got over 1000 hours on this game so I can say without a doubt it's one of my favorite steam games ever. I received the game and all of the DLCs as a gift but honestly if I hadn't I probably wouldn't have minded buying everything myself.

I'm really into history but not that self motivated to learn new things sometimes, but eventually I got intrigued and started doing a lot of things related to googling and searching up the civilizations, the leaders the game chooses, and how all of the different wonders fits into IRL history. Also started googling the civ specific units and buildings. It's a fun thing to do in the pass-time and there are tons of different ways to play the game (Passively or agro).

I have mostly nothing but pros but if I could point out any con it would be that the AI's are a bit silly a lot of the time. Denouncing (basically telling the whole world you're a bad person and this DOES hold sway over other AI civs) over petty stuff like having more gold than them, units, or religion. I think theyre much better here than they are in Civ 6 where you can eventually get denounced for having a small naval or something like NOT going to war with other civs if you can believe that, but it's kinda hard to really make smart AIs I guess when the game is already so expansive.

This game is also insane amounts of fun when you get a big group of people. The multiplayer can get kind of buggy if you have poor internet but overall I still like it a lot on the few occasions I managed to get 7 other people together for an 8 player huge map. Online multiplayer is kinda meh - it's as good as it can get but occasionally you do get fun people. WIth the addition of discord I'd imagine it can be really fun to make new friends.

The mods are also neat as well, there's tons of different once for everyone's interests."
22736,good game
22737,"is nice
"
22738,This is the single greatest game ever made no question
22739,One of the best strategy games ever made. You can be lost in the one more turn for ever

22743,Yes
22744,Sunk way too many hours into this damn game.
22745,"One of my favourite all time games, if not my all time favourite, haves always been the Civilization franchise.  I must admit Civilization IV is my favourite of all, but V is still a great game."
22746,"Hours and hours, and it is almost mathematically impossible for two games to be the same.  MONTEZUMA!!!"
22747,gud
22748,thrown in deep end. pure shit.

22756,great game
22757,Barbarians are mean 8/10
22758,"If you like the idea of building an empire and competing against other empires, you'll probably like this game. Games can last around 8 hours, so make sure you have a lot of free time before starting a game."
22759,My go to for any mood!
22760,great educational game for kids that wanna play video games but not learn in this quarantine time. they will learn without even knowing it.
22761,"Civ 5 is the best game that I have ever played, and it’s probably one of the best shooters ever made.

Civ 4 was one of my favorite games of all time. The reason I say “was” is because now it just seems mediocre compared to this game. This game took every single aspect of Civ 4, and refined the hell out of it. That’s not an exaggeration. The combat, the environments, the weapons, the music, the boss fights; it all feels like a drastic improvement in comparison to the previous game. This game is much more than just a sequel to the Civ reboot, this game transcends Sid Meier's Civilization as a whole, and creates a whole new FPS experience, which is probably the best FPS experience you can get.

This game takes a much different approach than Civ 4. Civ 4 was a basic FPS game with intense combat, but it didn’t really require much concentration. You just shot demons, glory killed them when you needed health, and chainsawed them when you needed ammo (which likely wasn’t often, since the game gave you a ton of ammo). Civ 5 requires a LOT more concentration, but in return, the combat intensity is quadrupled, and it feels incredible once you get the hang of it.

Glory kills and the chainsaw are back, but they’re crucial this time, because the game is much less merciful when it comes to health kits and ammo. In addition to that, there’s also..
A flamethrower mounted to your suit, which makes ignited demons drop armor pieces when shot. A dash, which allows you to almost instantly move a few feet in any direction. A supercharged blood punch that deals massive damage to any demon, and can hit multiple demons at once, which needs to be recharged via glory kills. Two grenades; a standard frag grenade, and an ice bomb that freezes demons, each with separate cooldown times. Weak points on demons, for example; you can destroy the arm cannons on a mancubus or the rocket launchers on a revenant, and you can instantly stagger and glory kill a cacodemon by shooting an explosive into its mouth, and more.

All of these mechanics are essentially necessary to succeed in combat, because as expected, the combat is a lot harder than it was in Civ 4. There are a lot more demons this time around. Each demon from  Civ 4 returned, with the addition of many demons from the original Civ 3, and some brand new demons. Nearly all of the returning demons were noticeably buffed, but your arsenal was also buffed, and weapon switching is crucial. In Civ 4, you could easily get through the game with only 3 or 4 of your 8 weapons. But in Civ 5, you’re most likely going to use all of your weapons, and switch through them frequently during combat. Each weapon has its own purpose, and using the right weapon for the right demon is extremely important.
It might seem overwhelming at first, and it is. I’ve watched hours of gameplay before I played this game for myself, and I thought I was prepared, but it still ended up taking me a while to get the hang of everything. But the more you play, the more you start to get the hang of everything, and once that happens, the combat starts to feel unbelievable.

None of the mechanics are gimmicks, they all play an important role in the combat flow, and they work perfectly together. They create a ton of possibilities, and make the combat feel like a massive step forward from any other FPS game.

By the time I got to the final level, I had a solid grasp of everything, and I was able to go BALLISTIC on the swarms of demons that were being thrown at me. It felt as if I had achieved synergy with the combat. I knew exactly what to do, and when to do it. The more you progress through the game, the more you improve, and the more you improve, the better it feels. That’s perfect game design, and these guys absolutely nailed it.
The combat is only one part of this game though, there’s a lot more

The level designs are insane. The first level alone is unlike anything I’ve seen in Civ 4, they look so good. Seriously, take a moment to look at the environment when you’re not in a combat arena, it’s incredible. There are a few cutscenes in this game, but they’re all relatively short, and they’re genuinely exciting to watch. They don’t interfere with the gameplay at all, but if you want, you can skip every cutscene and ignore the story entirely. The gameplay is still the main focus by far. This is probably the best approach I’ve ever seen to having a story within a game, and I wish there were more games that took this approach. There’s a decent bit of platforming in this game. It might sound out of place, but it fits surprisingly well, and I enjoyed a lot of it, although it can get a little excessive at times. The music is GOOD. I wasn’t a huge fan of the Civ 4 soundtrack, it just felt average to me. This game is definitely different though. Mick Gordon nailed the soundtrack this time. ID Software really went out of their way to keep this game true to the classic Civ games. They redesigned nearly every returning demon to match their classic counterpart, and even included minor features such as the cacodemon’s blue blood. It really shows how much care went into making this game and pleasing the fans. The game runs incredibly for a game with such good graphics. I’m able to get 100+ frames per second at 1440p with a GTX 1080 (which is a video card from 2016, just in case you aren’t familiar with PC hardware)

There’s honestly nothing bad that I can say about this game. This is pure FPS perfection and video game perfection as a whole. This is the best experience I’ve had with a game since I was a young kid. I’m confident that this game is still going to be talked about, and played years from now.

22762,jj
22763,"Though the gameplay is nearly as good as the best Civ in the series (Civ IV), there is one fatal flaw in this game: audio is interrupted and muted if you Alt-Tab out of the game. This is, of course, not a big deal UNLESS you are a Twitch/Mixer/YouTube streamer. Streamers need to frequently tab out of a game to manage their chat, streaming software, etc., and the interrupted audio is extremely disruptive. It renders the game unstreamable for anyone who cares about the quality of their stream. The Civilization series are know for their outstanding music and audio, and losing that is a crippling defect.

What makes this worse that, by all reports, it used to work but a patch broke it years ago. The publishers have been deaf to a problem that could be backed out by reverting whatever change introduced this bug.

Bottom line: if you don't stream, you're fine. Enjoy the game and its many mods. If you intend to stream this game with any kind of decent presentation, you're out of luck. Half the game experience for viewers is needlessly broken."
22764,Great Game. Fun solo and even more so with friends.
22765,"Great game but be careful the time will slip away from you, one hour turns into four!"
22766,Very fun strategy sim
22767,great
22768,It's good but waiting for my friends to hit next turn takes a lifetime.
22769,I love how you can just get lost in it
22770,Better than 6
22771,Studying for exams? Nah
22772,"very good, polynesia may not be top tier but always fun :)"
22773,"I have never played a game with a higher next turn factor, and I tried CIV 6 but between the pixar graphics and no positive differences I will stick with good old civ 5."
22774,The best Civ by far imo
22775,Civilization V? More like Crack Simulator V
22776,"Played as the USA, destroyed Babylon while searching for oil. Very historically accurate. 10/10"
22777,It good.
22778,"Excelente juego de estrategia por turnos.
Super adictivo.
Juegue 13h solo en mi primera partida.
Recomendadisimo por el precio, sobretodo en ofertas con todos los dlc."

22794,great
22795,Good Game
22796,"great game, pretty much a classic"
22797,One of my favorite games of all time. Civ 5 has one of the best AI in the gaming world (Excluding Nuclear Gandhi). It also has many features that both war games and city builders have. 9/10.
22798,It's pretty epic
22799,good
22800,"If you start playing this game, you will want to keep playing this game. Everything important in life becomes secondary. You will understand the meaning of one more turn and realise why its never just one more turn."
22801,"probably the best game ever. who even is sid meier anyway?
"
22802,fun strategy game
22803,Its okay
22804,yes

22806,"Very fun, lots of replayability, I like VI better though"
22807,"Probably one of my favorite games ever.  When ever Im bored or know I need to kill a few hours, I fire up this game and let time fade away."
22808,"Timeless classic. As a strategy game it can take a while to get used to all of the mechanics, I still haven't at 390+ hours."
22809,economics and fun whoot
22810,Nostalgia
22811,"Its Fun
"
22812,"""You played this for 1040 hours. Would you recommend this game to other players?""

Yes... yes I would."
22813,like the new area of control ariund the city
22814,"Especially during the first few games you will play for 12 hours straight, beware."
22815,"It can take a bit of getting into, as with many strategy games. Many Civ fans prefer 3 or 4, but 5's still solid if a little simple in comparison. Gandhi, why are you looking at me like that?"
22816,"yeah it's good 
"
22817,I approve
22818,yo why is the intro so loud
22819,Game keeps crashing.  Local files validation repeatedly run and 3 files keep getting lost for some reason.  Now game won't even load up properly. Boo.
22820,"While in my opinion CIV IV is still a lot better, it is a game that is very hard to put down."
22821,"If you start a game youll end up glued to the computer for 8 hours so beware... Takes a second to ""get"" the game but once it clicks its hella addicting. Also ghandi might call you pathetic and diss your army"
22822,"I played a bit and can say I love this game a lot, great to pass the time during a boring day."
22823,"Balanced civs, good graphics and builders can luckily work tiles without dissapearing unlike in civ 6"
22824,"good'
"
22825,"nice game, had a match that lasted a month"

22828,Solid
22829,yes

22839,Me Heisenberg and this is sublime piece of video game literature. Me have been inspired very much over past couple of months I shed a tear. I win game against noob
22840,Amazing game would recommend it to anyone who likes strategy games.
22841,"good game. should buy...if you have friends
"
22842,"I swear to god I'm not lying when I say this. There was this crazy scientist guy, and he turned himself into a fucking pickle. I'm dead serious. He calls himself pickle Rick. It's the funniest shit I've ever seen."
22843,It's rad.
22844,"the developers decided to update a game that used to work just fine on cross platform between mac and pc, making it impossible to now play cross platform..... extremely dissapointing. wasted my money on this crap now. thanks."

22846,One of the best strategies ever!
22847,F
22848,love this game.
22849,"Just plain fun, I love building games."
22850,Civ Games are always great.  Never have been let down by one.  But expect to lose a lot of time playing.  So addictive!  Just one more turn!!
22851,"its good
"
22852,"best game i've ever played, takes a bit to learn but all you need to is start it explains a lot.
no other strategy game is so complex and involves the entirety of human technology,
highly recomend"
22853,.
22854,"Really fun game, much better than civilization 6"
22855,"If you wish to maintain free will over your body and mind I implore you, do not buy this game, once you start playing there is NO stopping. If you do buy this, say goodbye to your loved ones and friends, as you will never be seeing them again."
22856,chill but also makes me wanna punch a hole through my screen
22857,Maybe the best game I have played
22858,"This game is loads of fun! I started here but became more familiar with Civ 6 and its convenient free roads. Love coming back to this version, though, for a change of pace & its different culture method and tech track."
22859,"Incredible replayability, great game modes, one of my favorite games of all time hands down"
22860,Very Nice!
22861,good
22862,Its gucci
22863,Great game or time waster lots of fun and endlessly changeable.  It can be a different game every time limited only by your imagination.

22872,123
22873,best strategy game ever.
22874,Where did the time go?
22875,Very addictive and fun. Game has a lot of depth and you constantly learn new things. On the downside games tend to get a little snowbally
22876,One of the best games I've ever played
22877,"great game, very time consuming"
22878,"Growing up, some of my all time favorite games were the RTS C&C series. This game is like the adult, fully engulfing version. I thought this would just be a boring, cell phone style, turn by turn game when I first saw the series and put off trying it until recently. I've since clocked 32 hours in a very short period of time. The game is incredibly in depth and based on strategy from turn one. Really well made."
22879,"4/10

- Edit:
          3/10"
22880,great game
22881,"I am planning to destroy my family and extended family. This game has helped me with excellent strategy. Their food supply has been cut off. Soon they will die and I will be a majority stakeholder in the family business. Thank you, Sid Meier."
22882,if you play alexander go fuck yourself
22883,nice
22884,super fun game to fill hours and hours
22885,Learning this game is super
22886,"Amazing game, lots of fun and plenty of replayability. I much prefer this one to any other in the franchise including civ6 the newest installment. Expansions are great and add lots of new, fresh content."
22887,This game has the most replay value of any game I've ever owned. Is it the best game of all time? No. Is it a very solid game that you can regularly get on sale and still play with other players regularly despite the newer titles? Yes. A great game for playing endlessly during the great indoors-athon that is March 2020.
22888,love it
22889,"This game is a good balance of complexity, with games like Starcraft/AoE on one end, and HoI/EU on the other."
22890,Any Civ game is worth playing!
22891,Its Civilization i dont have to say anything.
22892,I like Civ 5 the best. I like turn-based strategy. I also like that there is a progression in terms of difficulty levels you can select. Each game is also pretty customizable which is nice. Idk it's a fun game. It works well on my Mac which I understand isn't necessarily the best gaming interface.
22893,.
22894,great game also works in hotseat from the same pc.
22895,gud game
22896,great
22897,Nope. No i would not. Get Civ VI
22898,It's pretty gud.
22899,"You can learn the rules of game from scratch in one or two hours; it's complex, but intuitive.  From there, it's on you to explore the mechanisms, the strategies, Civ biases, etc.

If you're l looking for something to stimulate your brain while you're working from home or taking online classes, this is a GREAT game to Alt-Tab in and out of."
22900,"very interesting game, for me better than Civilization VI"
22901,Amazing for someone who loves strategy games and wants to be hooked for days haha
22902,Very good but very difficult

22906,"All around solid and fun game, though the AI keeps beating me to the wonders. :'("
22907,its cool i guess
22908,Great game to just Sandbox. scenarios have good reply value
22909,"As someone who has loved strategy games my entire life. This isn't one and is, quite in fact the best sleeping medication you'll ever receive."
22910,good
22911,"this game rules, i'll be playing it to the end of time"
22912,Great game
22913,"Absorbing, one more turn thx"

22924,It's alright.
22925,very gud
22926,Civ 5 > > > Civ 6
22927,Wish they would work-out Mac and PC crossplay
22928,This game is fantastic. Well made and addictive. It's a lot of fun and nothing makes you feel better than burning down every single city after nuking them for settling where I planned. I am looking at the dirty Shoshone scum and their gosh darn greedy leader. 10/10 support trading them blankets with small pox after taking my pearls for the second time.
22929,It's good you can be president
22930,Solitaire
22931,best game of this type.
22932,Bestfucking game
22933,If you like 4X games this is one of the best out there.
22934,its kinda fun
22935,Still has the same unnecessary multiplayer loading issues since day 1. Good job on the dev not bothering to do anything about it. I guess they rather make subpar sequels.
22936,thumbs up
22937,played the first version thought it was fun. Bought the expansions and regreted it. The game is unplayable You can get to the point of establishing a religion and you are instructed to  choose. However any choose you pick will not allow you to continue and you cannot continue with the game.  Dont waste your money I will be asking for a refund.
22938,gud
22939,its pretty alright
22940,"Yes, I like mmmmmmmmmm."
22941,good
22942,gaem wus gUd!!1!!
22943,Fun game
22944,"Really Awesome Game! I was hooked on Civ. 4, but now... Civ. 5 is my ""fix"". If you loved 4, you'll love 5 (but whatever you do, don't get 6. Not as good as it looked. I totally regret it)"
22945,"Great game
"
22946,great game!
22947,great game
22948,funtimes for all the family
22949,Good
22950,"Very enjoyable, both single- and multi-player."
22951,Hooked me. No strategy game will ever come close to Sid Meier's Civilization V with the Brave New World expansion. An absolute masterwork.
22952,gud gem
22953,"2pm - Start game.
5pm - Just a couple more turns
4am - *sigh* I did it again."
22954,"I liked how addicting it was

22956,"Hell ya, If you love to play strategy games this is the game for you!"
22957,"good game, lots of strategy and time required but fun once you understand the game and how to play"
22958,good

22960,really time consuming and will devour  your  time
22961,iz gud
22962,"If you need to make 2 weeks at home seem like 1 weekend, play this game."
22963,Fairly complex gameplay.
22964,addiction at it's peak
22965,gud game
22966,It's a Civ game. If you don't know what that is this is a slow turn based strategy game. It is definitely not for everyone. But its still fun for those with the patience.
22967,"I don't know why i'm awake right now, I went to bed four hours ago. But i couldn't help but think about the current war i had going on and now here i am eyes baggy and bloodshot but still going at it.

This game is addicting but also the AI can get under your skin."
22968,"If you have ever wanted play with your friend as egypt while your friend plays as china and then you build the great wall, and he builds the pyramids then this is the game for you."
22969,Great game to play while quarantined and working from home!
22970,"Trash game, pay to win DLC."
22971,"It's got a lot of layers and a lot of components to learn so it's entertaining, even after a while of playing. Played this game for ages and love it."
22972,addictive
22973,Its a very entertaining game. Lets you use different strategys to win the game. Very fun to play a lot of maps and characters from which to chose
22974,"This is a good game, very re playable. I would recommend this to anyone who is even a little bit interested in strategy games because this is one of the best strategy ever made."
22975,buy it
22976,Im jingis han raped half of the world
22977,yh

22980,Buy this. Just buy this.
22981,eeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee
22982,good turn based strategy game i think its better than 6....its just more fun the the last released version of the game
22983,good
22984,Very fun and engaging game. There are tons of mods in the workshop.
22985,Amazing
22986,I love how this game lets you play anyway you want.
22987,good
22988,IT'S OK
22989,"Good Game, but CIV IV is better"
22990,"You can play for hours without noticing. Seriously, I thought 2 or 2.5 hours had passed. No. Six. It's fun and addicting in a good way."
22991,Til is a jew
22992,Good
22993,epic
22994,so much fun!

23000,Infinitely replayable!
23001,"this is the apex of civlization, in games and also probably in real life."
23002,better than 6
23003,damn
23004,"Good game, better than civ 6"
23005,This game is heroin. Pure joy. And not to mention rather educational
23006,Great
23007,I would recommend this game over civilization 6 any day
23008,noice
23009,"This game is very well rounded. It is alot of fun to play, causes you to think critically and is also very cool as an educational tool as to how best grow an empire."
23010,yrd
23011,Yee
23012,"It sucked in the beginning
after they fixed all the bugs Its a Great game"
23013,yhsrthsrth
23014,It's pretty good. Would play again.
23015,It's Civ 5.
23016,This is a really fun game to play by yourself or with friends. I love the strategy part of the game.
23017,Overall a great game That can take all day but is worth it.
23018,Nice
23019,"Having played all the other Civ's this one is a good upgrade, though word of warning. I would highly recommend getting the expansion packs or compared to IV it will feel a bit light. Once you've got the expansion packs it will feel like a much updated IV. 
Took me a while to realise that you don't need transport ships to send your troops around. That was both bizarre and good :-)"
23020,"Civlizations 5 is a classic it is the time of game you can start a campaign to conquer the world then come back later.
"
23021,very nice
23022,"much good, many funs"
23023,"I had a buddy of mine tell me about this game, about a year ago now, and upon playing it the first time I became almost overwhelmed with the amount of information and personalization. It takes some time to get used to of course, just like with any game, but once you have the reigns, it is a blast! I could play this game for hours! From picking your own map, to picking who you'd like to play as, to who you play with and how many you'll play with, whether you pick or you have them picked at random. This game could easily entertain you for years. 10/10!!"
23024,"The game is, scratch that - was, super fun.

I will never buy a 2K and/or Firaxis game again. They broke the game and they won't fix it. They want you to buy the next Civ game. They don't seem to understand that I like and prefer the Civ V version of the game and that is what I paid for... but now, the money that I spent is wasted and I have no game to play.

I hope the executives have an unending beg bug infestation.

I can get this game to work now. In Linux, I have to launch steam with a script to limit the number of cores to 8 or less.

taskset -c 2,6,10,14,18,22,26,30 /usr/games/steam

In Windows, I am unsure what I did to make it work, but apparently, windowed mode was required. I can play this game again so I am changing the review to ""Recommend"". Firaxis/2K still should not have made the changes they did, but when the game works, it is VERY fun.
"
23025,is good.
23026,i have played this game over and over again. IT is such a great  stratgy game 650 hr playing and still have not gotten bord with this
23027,"it is very fun
and interative"
23028,"BEWARE - as of nov 2019 crossplay No longer works between a PC and a mac. total pain workarounds to try and fix (loading legacy versions in beta) that haven't worked so far. Sure I could play with other mac players but I bought this to play with my friend, not strangers. (no offense, strangers). booo!"
23029,do not buy this trash it doesnt work you can't even play with your mates they blocked macos crossplay what the fuck why would you do that i can't play with my m8 so yeah garbage
23030,q
23031,dont let anyone play germany
23032,"A classic, must have for any strategy game lover."
23033,Love this game. Spent alot of my life playing it
23034,Excellent game
23035,exactly what i want from a strategy
23036,"good game :)
"
23037,ef sa neeeee
23038,"I have played way too much of this game, and yet, I must play more. If you wish to sign your life away to the CIV gods, I highly recommend."
23039,it rules
23040,good game takes long time but overall i recommend this game
23041,+1 Amazing game that makes you use your brain. Highly recommend
23042,very great game
23043,"Too much adrenaline coursing through my veins. Sid Meier's Civilization 5 is the love child of Will ""The Sims"" Wright and Sid Meiers. The home building works really well and trapping Gandhi in the shower or denying mussolini that last plate of dinner is so satisfying.

Would prefer that the tech you research for your empire would affect the household more and social services where always trying to repossess my baby which seems unfair when for example the Sioux Indians are kicking off outside my border and im left distracted.

Couldnt visit the united nations building as Russia's beloved Stalin, but I could visit every natural wonder, go figure.

Rating: 5 birthday pies out of 5"
23044,It is freaking awesome.
23045,noice
23046,"Cross platform gaming is not working anymore. Sadly this problem is existing since several months, but doesn't seem to be fixed..."
23047,Since you can't play together on Mac OS Catalina with your windows friends this isn't really a crossplattform game.
23048,yaa
23049,"I nuked a couple friends. Started a world war. Razed cities. Broke the server. 
DIdn't talk for a week after that.

I'd FuCkInG Do IT AgAiN (8.5/10 - Multiplayer can be a bit buggy, but still very fun overall)
"
23050,This game is well balanced an fun to play
23051,fun strategy
23052,So. Addictive.
23053,very noice
23054,Me and my friend Labros spent hours playing this lovely game. Would recommend to play with plenty of biscuits and numerous cups of tea as you can lose track of time. Solo is 9/10 and Multiplayer 10/10.
23055,Good game
23056,"This is the best, that is all."
23057,"It's actually possible to play kind of fast, but it's better to take time to enjoy the many strategy options! Great game with tons of different map and opponent options."
23058,great game
23059,Egypt waged war on me. No one messes with Ghengis Khan
23060,"Really amazing strategy game. There are so many layers of complexity and different ways of playing it's really impressive they managed to make the game so well balanced.

The only downside is that the developer's business model is DLCs which add up to extravagent prices and once they are out of ideas, they create a new game, stripping out most of what you purchased in DLCs so you get to buy them again. Therefore, they also deliberately leave and ignore bugs in Civ V that you'll have to suffer with... that aside, I still highly recommend Civ 5!"
23061,Its a pretty good game.
23062,its better then 6
23063,Easily one of the best strategy games I've ever played. 10/10
23064,"Great game! Intricate, fun with friends or alone, endless ways to replay the game and have a unique experience every time."
23065,Best of all the Covs
23066,it good
23067,Yes
23068,"Very good game, very good, don't bother with 6, this is very good."
23069,I love this game
23070,i've been playing for more than 2000 hrs. my games get so intense it takes an hour each turn
23071,"i mean its been out for years, if you havent played it youre kinda lame"
23072,Best game I've ever played. Had it on disc before I got steam so the hours played are far beyond what it says on my profile. Couldnt recommend enough
23073,bg
23074,Very entertaining
23075,it's not bad.
23076,Perfect game for a lan party!
23077,"Fantastic game, great for socially distanced fun times"
23078,One More Turn....
23079,"One...More....Turn.... Wait, what happened to the world? This game can be a tunnel. The real world may have experienced a pandemic outside the comfort of your house while being fully engaged with this game and avoiding all anxiety that comes with it. Have the pizza delivery number on standby, or better, make it a repeated automatic order. Enter March 2020 and leave the tunnel later this year in a changed world......"
23080,"Huge fan of this game. Endless amount of replays possible. Get your friends together with this and the Brave New World and Gods and Kings DLC's. One of the best games ever, hands down!"
23081,Yes
23082,m
23083,Un deniably a classic as far as rts goes
23084,gg
23085,Played the game for nearly 16 hours straight my first run only to lose to French tourism and I still went back and played 100 more hours. I recommend it to all my friends
23086,As good as original
23087,fun game. good time waster. lots of leaders to choose from.
23088,hot game
23089,good game
23090,this game makes me happy
23091,ball
23092,"Consistently makes you feel as if you are truly a leader of a great civilization. Starting from the dust, you will (hopefully) rise into the stars as you take over the world. Diplomacy is fantastic. With a vast array of civilizations to choose from (with the help of mods,) every game can be a new experience. I highly recommend you get the DLC in order to make your experience the best it possibly can be. Again, the modding community is fantastic and I believe almost essential to creating a unique experience. They took a big step back with CIV IV. 10/10 buy and play with your friends and make everyone mad at you lmao."
23093,69
23094,10/10 would have my friends never play this with me ever again
23095,the best game on PC
23096,Good Game
23097,"nice

23098,civ for the civilized
23099,Endless fun! Logged over 400 hrs and still can't wait to play!
23100,"I've been a big fan of strategy games for many years, and this one will always had a special place in my heart. I never get tired of playing this game, as there are enough civs to play as, and different options to be chosen between each game. You can switch up playstyles on a whim, and manage your civilization however you want. The game mechanics are relatively easy and can be learned quickly. Overall, I would say that this is a fantastic game to play."
23101,It's a good one
23102,"this game will save you
"
23103,nignog
23104,Great game.
23105,gud

23108,Its good.
23109,yes
23110,Liked it better than Cats
23111,Addictive game. The AI at the hardest level is hard to beat. Multiplayer works well.
23112,it no longer works with cross platform. i can't play with my friends on PC with my mac
23113,my favorite game
23114,"A classical strategy games for rookies as aces ....

23120,Very good game for confinement
23121,ONE MORE TURN
23122,fun time.
23123,This is yet another fun Civ in the Civ series. I played it on CDs many years ago. Found it for a good deal on Steam and have been enjoying it all over again.
23124,"This game is amazing! Without mods, the game is incredible, but when you add the mods that make the UI more user friendly and add more uses to resources, you find that the game becomes 10 times better. Even years after its release, the mods keep it fresh and fun. This game is easily 7/10 without mods and 9/10 with mods."
23125,Love all the Civ games.
23126,its civ you either like it or you dont
23127,"GOOD game, expansion packs very good but not needed, props worth watching some gameplay to get a feel for more complicated play"
23128,"Commit all the coolest war crimes in this epic third person shooter where human rights are the ammunition and chinese orphans are the firearms, Rameses II for president 2020  born to die Bismark is a bitch 290192909 dead barbarians born to die"
23129,"It's just a cool game, its a little slow but I bet someone with a better laptop or pc could run it no problems. The mechanics are good and I feel like I have a goal the whole time"
23130,Great game
23131,Barbarians killed me on turn 12. 10/10 would get killed by baboons again.
23132,"Over 1000 hours, still fun, still learning."
23133,Ive had such a great time playing this game over 400 hours.  Always something new to try!

But for real - Amazing game, only played a few hours and its been nothing but intriguing. I'm learning slowly, would recommend playing with friends to learn."
23158,"I love the challenge of balancing political, religious, cultural, military, and technological factors to craft a win."
23159,Perfect game
23160,"Why did you remove the support for Geforce Now Streaming for your Games? As a great fan of the Civilization/Firaxis Games I have to leave this negative review, because this descision does not feel right! I will not buy another PC again in my life. So If you are not going with streaming, you will loose a fan that's been playing civilization since part 1 a who spent lots of money on your franchise. The Endless Games still work so maybe I should switch there...

23190,yeah idk about this one man. maybe i'll play some more and figure it out.
23191,its fun
23192,love it
23193,dope
23194,"In my opinion, this was the height of Civ games."
23195,Good game.
23196,gg
23197,Cool game to play with friends
23198,Its fun and casual for those who want something to mindlessly play as they watch videos. If you want a bit more of a challange try upping the difficulty or adding mods.
23199,love civ since 92
23200,"sid nailed it
"
23201,cool
23202,good

23205,on sale its like $15 for full game and dlc its def worth it even against civ 6
23206,"First Civ game I played. 8/10

Would not recommend Beyond Earth."
23207,Works well.
23208,"Civ is an incredible game.  Endless hours of fun.  Great for passing the time, and as a turned based game, it is great to play when doing chores or catching up with friends.  I couldn't recommend more."
23209,YES!
23210,"Get all the dlc, it makes the game. just wait for a sale."
23211,"epic shit happens 

"
23212,"1,320 hours played,,,"
23213,Its pretty good.
23214,I highly rate all Civ games. Even the first one holds up.
23215,"I lost the screenshot but:
Gandhi had a modern army (with tanks and all that jazz) at my frontiers and he declared war against me. I retaliated with nukes.
Fun times."
23216,Best turn based strategy game ever!
23217,its good but also meh
23218,Super nice you know.
23219,"just buy it clown

23220,It is a very good fun happy time.
23221,its good
23222,DEFINITELY FUN NOT BORING AT ALL
23223,My absolute favorite 4X game.
23224,b i s m a r k
23225,i've been stuck inside cause of COVID19 for 7 days and this game allowed me to feel like society isn't collapsing all around me
23226,Still great.  There are days when i don't feel like running around and shooting things.  I would like to build and tyrannically dictate to society my every whim.  It's relaxing.
23227,Highly addictive. Really enjoy being able to pump the difficulty too.
23228,einfach subba
23229,The best one
23230,"One of my all time favorite RTS games, Mod-able to oblivion and back. Great with a friend too!
Score= 9.5/10"
23231,I just love this game. it never gets boring to me so i tend to find myself coming back to every other month.
23232,Best Civilization Game
23233,This has to be the best Civ in its series so far. It is challenging yet engaging at the same time.
23234,"Rating: 10/10

This game is epic! There's not really a wide variety for choice of words. What makes it even more interesting? The fact that you can literally create your own map from the smallest detail to fighting the greatest wars (even though I'm still working on it, I've seen gameplay). I really enjoy this game. I love the whole idea of being able to either seize victory through my charming words and deeds of diplomacy, or unleash the wrath of my armies upon the nations in an effort to relieve myself of a bad mood lol. I haven't tried Civ 6 yet, nor do I think I want too...but who knows... It might be a future rating. Ahaha."
23235,This is an excellent gave. It has many scenarios  and can keep you occupied for hours.
23236,Civ V is GOAT.  Like what else do you say?
23237,venice ez mode
23238,pretty fun if you cant afford civ 6 like me this is a nice choice.
23239,"Incredibly Addictive!!!
"
23240,This game is yeet
23241,game good brain big.
23242,"bomb 
game"
23243,Classic time sinker - spent whole day playing this without even realising...
23244,"This is probably the third or 4th time I've crossed the 1k hour mark on this game before resetting the stats. This game is amazing and you can get it on a steam sale for like $12.59 to have all the expansions and almost all the DLC. At that rate I'm literally paying like 1 cent for every 4 hours of play. Imagine going to the movies and instead of ticket checks you had to give them a penny, they would cut it in half and you would watch the movie for a half a cent. Take a date and you're down a whole 1 copper... This game is value, and that's on the Movie Entertainment Exchange Rate."
23245,"6 takes work
"
23246,I always come back to this game even after five years. It never gets old. There's a little learning curve but after that you're golden.
23247,"I spread protestantism to Mecca and told Caesar to go fuck himself as Napoleon. Historically accurate fun for the whole family. Also, better than Civ IV."
23248,"i really like hexagons fuck rectangles man, hexagon gang"
23249,"For lovers of turn-based strategy, this game has always struck a fantastic balance of depth, variety, and replay-ability that I love. Peaceful, Warmongering, or any combination thereof of strategies all work with equal validity and each new start can be played in a completely new way. I ADORE this game and love coming back to it with friends online or just on my own. Not to mention that the workshop is stuffed with content to experiment with once you've exhausted everything you can in the main game. Probably one of my favourite strategy games of all time."
23250,Awesome strategy game. remember playing the second one. it was awesome
23251,nice
23252,Best game ever
23253,Civ V great game.
23254,epic
23255,Total waste of precious time.
23256,"Not a fan of this version.
Civ V, the quest for luxuries.

You people can be starving bus so long as they have their wine they're happy.
Found a city -3 Happy
For every pop above X - 1 Happy
Exploit a new luxury +4 Happy
Build a Colosseum  +1 Happy
Shrines and Temples don't make you happy they just generate faith
As you can see luxuries just dominate the game

Also can't trade maps

The manual is all fluff, no mention on how game mechanics work"
23257,ดี เกมดี ฆ่าเวลาได้ดีมาก
23258,Just one more turn simulator
23259,"Great game for quarantine.
"
23260,"amazing, buggy and better with friends

23261,it civ
23262,Fun with friends.
23263,"if you want to get sucked away for hours on a strategy game with such an incredible amount of depth, but with very easy entry... this is it. so good."
23264,this is very good game
23265,.
23266,This is shit.
23267,Great game.
23268,One of the best games of all time.
23269,This is a madlad's game. Ruined a friendship of 17 years over a civ 5 game. Good stuff
23270,its alright
23271,good  game
23272,"This game is without a doubt the best turn-based-strategy game ever made. I have spent countless hours playing this game, yet to play the same one twice. The endless possibilities are amazing, you can fight the Egyptians as the Americans, you can trade uranium for horses between Venice and Rome, you can watch the greatest pacifist of all time proceed to nuke the map into a winter wonderland. This game is the perfect balance of fun and serious, simple and strategic. I have thrown a lot into this game, and it amazes me every time. The community surrounding this game is amazing, with amazing modders and AU that can supplement your game play. Civ V is the best in the series, with its two follow up games falling short of the hype. Perhaps its just impossible to make a better Civ game. A part of me thinks that they knew they never were going to make a better one, and they knew it. The game has accolades and praise from all corners of the gaming community, for good reason. One day, when I'm old, I hope to find this game again and to play it, and feel the magic just one more time. It finds you always looking for just one more city, one more tile, one more turn."
23273,MEGAFUN
23274,If only I got paid to play this game. So many hours gone. Love it!
23275,what are yall thoughts on benghazi lol
23276,worth it
23277,THIS game is not stable on modern Mac systems. But the latest insult to injury is quitting mid-turn for the sake of a scheduled software upgrade. Fuck that.
23278,Amazing game series!!!
23279,"It's fine, I guess."
23280,fn sik
23281,its fun
23282,"I LOVED this game when I first got it in 2016 (late to the party). However, in 2018, it stopped loading on my PC. Other games run fine, but attempting to open Civ V causes Steam to display several errors that won't let the game run but also claim the game is running in the background even after force quitting. I have to manually restart my computer to play a different game instead. It's very frustrating. 

The game itself is fantastic, with some of the best visuals I've ever seen. I love the narrator's voice and the drama of it. I've only played with expansions, and they entertained me for several hundred hours."
23283,Its Alright
23284,"Very easy to understand, i don't know why people call this game hard to understand. it is quite fun when I understand what is going on, the GUI is quite dated but it functions well."
23285,its a good game that i would highly recommend to any interested party
23286,КАК СУКА ВЫИГРАТЬ?
23287,Fun
23288,good
23289,good not smelly
23290,Classic turn based game where you can take control of an historic civilization to see if you can do it better!! Absolutely amazing and it will live on for decades to come I'd imagine.
23291,Very good strategy game.
23292,"Peter keeps making me call him fuher and i dont know why

23294,this games kinda autistic
23295,"Awesome game
"
23296,"Good mechanics vs. Civ 4.  If you liked Civ 2 or 3, this is a good follow-on to it."
23297,this version remains a fun game.
23298,"This is one of those games that is hard to look at and think ""i'm going to love this"", but once you get started it is so hard to stop playing."
23299,Great Game. Good Fun. I Love History!
23300,Pretty damn good
23301,goog
23302,lovely
23303,Wait till it is on sale and get all the expansions.
23304,how many hours do you got?
23305,"Ruined my studies with this game. Now I am an engineer, who knows a lot about algorithms, databases, and programming such as functional programming, but I work in a store warehouse. 4,5/5, would waste my life again. Get this with expansions or you're going to have a horrible time."
23306,just one more turn
23307,this very good game take up lots of time lolxD
23308,Really enjoy the game play and the chance to play with others
23309,Replayable

23323,Noice
23324,It'sa gute game!
23325,"I think this is a perfect game for people who is into multiplayer and strategy. It doesn't require a lot of experience to get started, it's easily enjoyed thanks to the help of the ""advisors"" and can get pretty complex if you wish.
The wide range of customization parameters for a single scenario makes you enjoy every new game as the first."
23326,I like the segregation of nations due to the Wuhan (Chinese) Flu.
23327,love it
23328,It's a good game.
23329,best fockin game eva made. buy it you cunt!
23330,v nice
23331,yes
23332,"Fun game, can't recommend it because it crashes often enough to be aggravating."
23333,.
23334,"Good turn based strategy for anyone, foudational and fun"
23335,You can name cities and religions based off Jihads and Backstreet Boys
23336,"If you don't know what to play, this is a perfect game to play. It is a good time consumer, and it is very fun to play. The only downside is that it can get repetitive at times and that the AI make no sense. Other than that though it is a fun game with diverse civilizations and a not too complicated system. The only thing I still haven't figured out in my 146 hours of playing this game is how to win through tourism. I never really looked into it, however I am going to soon because of the achievements."
23337,just love getting fucked in all ways in this
23338,I have no memory of this game but it's POPPING OFF in 2020 quarantine.  I'm having a good time so hop on and play a bit.  Its more than a little time consuming.
23339,"great game, easy enough to figure out on your own but still complex enough to keep it interesting for the veteran player. Lots of extras in the expansion packs too"
23340,One more turn
23341,good
23342,d
23343,It is the good
23344,Best CIV imo
23345,It's Ok
23346,"Terrible UI, terrible balancing, nonsensical AI that does not use half the game mechanics the players have to use (and that has to cheat to make the game challenging), lack of all the normal diplomacy stuff that makes sense for a game with any politics whatsoever (you need a declaration of friendship to barter with gold, cant trade individual techs), nonsensical happiness system (why would people who are complaining about high population be mad about a new city that alleviated their population problem?) and overall just a terrible compliment to the civ franchise that failed to fix its ""broken"" problems from the previous installments in a way that felt good. Instead its arbitrary limitations to ""fix"" things like ICS (infinite city sprawl) and tech whoring to the AI's. The game lacks government types, lacks whipping (forced labor from the previous installments), but does get religion right. Whoopie one thing. Good job Firaxis.

In short, this game is garbage compared to Civ III complete (with mods). Don't waste your time, money, or friendships on this absolute trash.

*edit*
I played for another 50 hours because im a simp, my opinion hasn't changed however now I understand just how abhorrently unbalanced this game is, playing this game with good players is absolute misery and the 18th time seeing Poland, Babylon, England, Maya, and Ethopia in the same game is just mind numbing. Poor Venice, holy shit what the hell where they thinking? The mechanics to stop ICS don't even work if you know what you are doing, and Liberty builds literally just consoom the entire fuckin map. I am just at a loss of words for how abysmal this game is designed, balanced, and carried out compared to EARLIER TITLES IN THE SAME SERIES. I even got a copy of the original civ on DOS and it was a more fun experience than this. If you are bad at the game its drudgery as the AI cheats you out or you are subject to your friends tyranny for 4 hours. If you are good at the game its absurdly easy to roll over AI and it turns multiplayer games into a bigger sweaty and smelly mess than a Melee tournament. All in all, once again just play Civ 3, or Civ 1, or if you are desperate for nicer graphics then Civ 4. Or better yet play Eu3."
23347,The Besterest
23348,This game sucks
23349,"probably best game ever, I just need one more turn before I finish my review"
23350,Addicting game with lots of replay value
23351,Great game
23352,Hours of fun
23353,"Great game. I'd get VI if you haven't played either, just because it has more depth, but this is still super solid.

Especially recommended for groups of friends"
23354,game lit
23355,its the only game I've been playing since it's been out
23356,Awesome Game!!!
23357,"I finally got around to playing Civ 5 in 2020, and wow have I been missing out. Not much else to say that hasn't already been said about this game. It's so addicting that I often forget what day it is. My steam friends check in to make sure I've slept in the last 72 hours. I'm starting to see the real world in a hexagonal grid. I think I need a break."

23366,"It's a great turn based strategy game, although it is very easy to lose track of time. 159+ hours played, worth every penny."
23367,The last good Civ game IMO. But I'm old school.
23368,Love this game very addictive
23369,Very fun. Many different ways to win for players looking for different kind of enjoyment.
23370,"Awesome game, never gets boring to me. good old reliable!"
23371,d
23372,"stupid addictive. you start playing and realize its been a few hours and you should go do something productive, but you are just a couple turns away from finishing some new technology and you want to stop at a good stopping point or you will forget what you were doing... 5 hours later your family members are telling you how you haven't moved all day, so you tell them you are going to stop and come hang out.  4 hours later you realize you never went to spend time with your family, its well past when you normally go to sleep, and Ghandi just finished the Manhatten project and you are completely unprepaired to deal with that psycopath."
23373,it crashes but its fun
23374,"I mean, I'm 1974 hours in after 4 years of gameplay. It's just a good game!"
23375,Solid game
23376,I play this game on and off again and it still hold up. I have Civ VI on my switch but Civ V will always be the best pc Civ experience.
23377,"Don't buy unless you get all the expansions, with the expansions this game is amazing and gets even better if you download something like NQ or Takmod.
100% recommend this game for people who like losing 12 hours of time like they've been hit by a truck and have short term amnesia as they hit the next turn button."
23378,Educational and addicting
23379,Good
23380,Excellent turn based strategy game - not many games left that don't require real time play.
23381,"Is a good time with friends and buy yourself, but you should probably just get six now."

23401,This game is awseome!
23402,"A complex yet accessible, highly enjoyable game."
23403,"While it's definitely not a new game, CIv V is still provides a fantastic and in-depth experience.  The base game is fun on its own, but if you have the option of buying it bundled with the DLC on sale, it's definitely worth it. It's so easy to get sucked in for hours playing this game, and once you've sunk a couple hundred hours into it there are tons and tons of mods to completely change the game."
23404,"By far the best turn-based strategy game and probably the best installment of Civ saga. Plenty of units, different strategies to win and several nations to test your strengths. It contais interesting scenarios if you want to play specific battle situations."

23479,CIV5 > CIV6
23480,THE ROAD SYSTEM IS ABSOLUTE GARBAGE.
23481,Honestly as a solo game its fine and back in high school we used to all play as one big group and it ran great i recently bought the brave new world expansion and god and kings expansion to start playing with friends again and between the constant game crashes and constant freezes ( which i though mightve been my really old ssd dying but that would be a no now that ive tested it on all of my drives ) the game locks up about every 3 turns as if its re-syncing every one and then it will just crash. after about 6 hours of trying this and that and re-downloading a few times and trying something else here and there i just gave up. maybe some one will have some insight but honestly its not worth the head ache
23482,This game is epic

23494,"It's sadly... one of the best 4X games out there, which says a lot more about the desperate state of the 4X market than anything else. Don't get me wrong, it works... good enough, and it's fun to play... for the first half of every game, and it has multiplayer... for about an hour. So all in all, yeah, if you're looking for a 4X game to play that consistently works... good enough, and is fun for 2 hours a day then yeah, pick this up. If you want something better than I would recommend endless legends, but that has no multiplayer community."
23495,Amazing game!
23496,"i've played this junt for over 100 hours, what more can i say"
23497,I love the play and design of the game.
23498,Nothing to dislike and everything to like.
23499,nothing this game is dumb
23500,"solid gameplay, fun way to connect with friends during self-isolaion"
23501,Incredibly rich in content and fun to play
23502,g
23503,Yes!
23504,"Great game, but the DLC is a must have for this game, which becomes a huge problem when the DLC is the price of a whole other game. This is easily a great game to buy on sale, but do not pay full price for this."
23505,Never gets old
23506,Nice game
23507,amazing game made me like strategic games and board games
23508,Just One more turn... Very addictive and fun.
23509,"HHHUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUU IIIMMMM COOOOOOOOOMMINNNGGG
"
23510,"game good
will play again
cant afford the new one"
23511,I come back to this game over and over again as one of the great classics.
23512,"BUYER BEWARE

it does not list clearly that you can no longer play with mac users if you are playing on a PC, which was the only reason I bought the game. 

Apparently the community has known about this for a while and there are no plans in the foreseeable future to fix this."
23513,"Good game, complex at first but fun then. Really long paced even  on the fastest mode. one play through can take hours or days and online sessions is meh level

edit: multiplayer is good if you have friends ready to play, public games aren't too great from my experiences"
23514,yeah its alright
23515,Zero replay value
23516,God-tier game.
23517,good game. nuke go boom
23518,Great game civ 5/5.
23519,"This game was great to play with my friends, until they recently disabled cross platform playing. Terrible and disappointing decision by developers to remove this feature. I won't play this game again because of this..."
23520,Best civ hands down
23521,Ah it's fierce class so it is and sure you can go to war and that without softbois telling you about commies.
23522,CiV
23523,Nothing beats the thrill of traversing through eras & progressing forward in different fields as it does in CIv5 :)
23524,ATTILLAAAAA
23525,Just one more turn...
23526,"Civ V is an excellent strategy game that is great solo as well as being great for LAN parties with multiple players. Never thought I'd be so ""in to"" a ""turn based"" game. But, there you go... Surprise, surprise. BTW, I've been playing since Civ IV (perhaps earlier) and it still does not disappoint. Indeed tried CIV VI but my fellow gamers still prefer CIV V as the ""game of choice"" for LAN parties."
23527,Git
23528,epic game
23529,is fahn
23530,thank you Corona Virus for bringing me back to this sweet game
23531,A group of friends can play a couple rounds a week for months!!!
23532,great game
23533,"it has been one of my favorite clickbait strategy games for years, ive put hundreds of hours into it"
23534,Up there with Civ 4. Just stay away from 6.
23535,:)
23536,good game
23537,really fun to play with friends
23538,"Civilization 5 always holds a special place in my heart. Although I see the perks and beauty of Civ 6 and all of its DLC, Civ 5 combines the simplicity of Civ 4 with a new non-stack hex system. Also, the AI isn't perfect, it's slightly less annoying than Civ 6."
23539,"This is a very engrossing game and fun to play. I have spent hours and hours playing this game. Play at different speed and / or difficulty levels depending on how much time you have at hand.Based on the other factor about the number of other civilizations involved and victory conditions, one game may last hours."
23540,"much tactics, much strategy, much domination"
23541,Awesome
23542,Still a great game with a lot of fun workshop content
23543,It is one of the best Games I`´ve played in my life
23544,Very Fun Game. Lots of spanking international powers with spearmen in 1987 while also creating bombers to fuck off barbarians with gatling guns.
23545,Best civ game ever!!!
23546,good
23547,L
23548,"Not to brag, but I took over the entire world's banana supply in one play-through. 10/10"
23549,f
23550,the best civ ever made
23551,You could literally spend days on this game. It really can be played with no experience or an entire grand strategy before the game starts. Easily one of the best turned based strategies out there.
23552,totally amazing game allbeit shits fucky
23553,its good
23554,good times when you are locked up in home
23555,"This game is designed to be addictive, engaging without being satisfying. 

I've given in to my addiction and spent hundreds of hours wasting my time this way. Don't make my mistake. Do something else with your time. I literally can't even remember most of that time, it just disappears into a grey, bland fog when I try and think back on it. Each playthrough is the same, each civ is little different. Just enough there to feed the addiction, but no satisfaction or closure in sight. 

0/5. Go play something with a story and a beginning and an end, or at least something that requires skill and can be played competitively. This has neither."
23556,Yes!
23557,gud game
23558,It was a good game. Better than civ 6
23559,i like fighting the homies
23560,It'll suck your soul away if you take the time to learn it.
23561,da best
23562,"A very good game to play with friends
"
23563,It's like crack. I haven't played the other ones but this one is phenom.
23564,best game ever
23565,Good game!
23566,"Worthy purchase. I do recommend playing without DLC first time, but make sure you activate it when you feel ready. It adds so much depth to the game."
23567,Awesome well played game
23568,Old standby have played this game since its birth.
23569,
23570,good for 2 hours at a time
23571,"Great game to have while listening to a podcast in the background, even better game to play with friends."
23572,"This is the best board game you will ever find, but it was too complicated to make offline."
23573,"played it briefly, was okay."
23574,It is ok
23575,Extremely enjoyable. Undoubtedly the best strategy the best strategy game I have ever played.
23576,Yes!
23577,"anime land is real?
"
23578,It's a good game
23579,In depth strategy - good graphics - no glitches - good variety
23580,Good game to pass the time while in quarantine
23581,The decision trees an opportunities to interact with the AI.
23582,"Best civ game by far but it never goes on sale, you guys need to put it on sale so my friends will pick it up"
23583,Just playing this until 6 is on sale lol
23584,Is good
23585,awesome
23586,Top stuff

23593,pretty good
23594,"Good game, good with friends if you have time on your hands"
23595,"Quite fun with friends, but the net code is a little wacky due to the age of the game. Also pro tip, don't make the turn timer too long."
23596,it very good

23598,good game

23600,"This is the successor of a great great game with all the depth removed. Everything feels dumbed down, warring is just a pain in the ass without unit stacking, and although there are cutltural victories, there's no cultural game anymore. Spying has tranformed from an engaging part of the game to an excel list without any benefit to the game. 
This feels very much like the playmobil version of civilization.
Also, there's no way to play in offline mode - there's absolutely no need for an online connection, and the requirement is a prime example of an intrusive annoyance implemented by stupid game designers."
23601,Very fun
23602,fun
23603,"It's nice and have a complex gameplay elements. Hard to learn harder to master which makes the game so addictive. If you are into time consuming, too detailed and complex games this is a gem for you."
23604,"I love this game, but the fact that I can't run a single player game in Offline Steam mode(without internet connection) - is unacceptable. NOT recommended. Buy on another platform.

P.S. I tried many solutions suggested in Google, but it just wouldn't launch."
23605,Still easily the best in the Civ series. Even after 10 years I keep coming back to this game.
23606,"You feel like you've played for an hour, it's been 3 days. Your wife has left you, you're dehydrated and close to death and the police are at the door performing a welfare check. Amazing game though +1"
23607,Massive learning curve. Hundreds of hours in and I'm still discovering new stuff. Really fun with friends.
23608,"civ games are legendary, if you like these style games and its on sale then its a no brainer"
23609,"A solid game from amazing Civ series. 
Honestly I am too terrible at this game to give a comprehensive review, but I highly recommend it. Check out other peoples review and buy it. You won't be disappointed."
23610,i keep telling myself i'll play one more turn over and over
23611,At least it's a bit more cerebral than the average video game.
23612,Simply the all time best turn-based 4X strategy game.
23613,addictive
23614,its a good game
23615,poggers
23616,Sid Meier's Civilization V is the perfect game for yelling at everyone while discussing real-world takeover plans.
23617,"The game is well deserving of its legendary reputation. If you are at all interested in strategy games, and don’t mind waiting 5-10 hours for a match to end, give it a try."
23618,Every game is a little different based on location and such. Good strategy game.
23619,Very well done and a lot of fun you can lose yourself easily inside the game!
23620,have been playing since it came out. love.
23621,Good
23622,a good waste of time
23623,"I mean, its pretty cool I guess..."
23624,good
23625,"- barbarians steal my settler
- I destroy little f***ng barbarian piece of s**t to get my settler back
- another civ passing by steals the settlers in front of me
- how_dare_you.exe this means war!!!
- motherf**ker builds city with settler and now my unit doesn't stand a chance
9/10 got a little too emotional for me...also had a blast once getting nuclear weapons first and everyone started begging me to have mercy lol"
23626,"This is by far the best Empire game on the market, even better than Civ 6 in my opinion.  The graphics are very much adequate for this type of gaming, while also being easy to run on lesser powerful machines, and the gameplay is downright addicting if you are into turn based strategy games, especially with the historical accuracy, and effort that went into this game...  I would recommend this game over the reboot to any of my friends, and have probably put too many hours into this as is!"
23627,"Great for long solo games or weekend benders for online groups. amazing workshop and general community. definitely worth having in the library, even when not often played."
23628,cant play multiplayer with people not on mac
23629,BEST!!!
23630,made in maryland
23631,"[strike]Just 1 more turns.[/strike] More like ""Just 5 more hours configuring mods.""

That aside. It's like playing game with sociopathic AIs. You could have been sharing intels, fought wars together, denouncing same enemies, declaring friendships, maintaining a greeny diplomatic relations and what not. Behind that smile is a f-cking battalion ready to steamroll your bases. And they just going to declare war on you regardless of diplomatic stances. (WHAT ABOUT ALL THOSE WARS WE FOUGHT TOGETHER?!) It can feel disorienting sometimes if you are too immersed to the game. ARGH. The GREATEST BETRAYA-. If you have tendency to trust AIs more than human then this is going to give you headaches. 

*sign*

In the end you ponder and realize how much these drama and backstabbing resemble real life scenarios, 
You then shutdown your PC, appreciating every minutes you still have left on your bed.

Play game to escape life, but life happened in the game. 0/10. Not recommend."
23632,A+
23633,"Every game is different and apart from a game taking along time on a standard map it is enjoyable but frustrating at times.  I have managed to win at King level on a couple of occasions, progress at a higher level I assume would depend upon which character you start with and where, because King level is very difficult, but still preferable to CIV IV"
23634,"Super fun. Classic gets better with age.
"
23635,Long time fan!
23636,"My favourite strategy game ever. HOWEVER. I have two issues with it, firstly, loading takes FOREVER in the modern era if you have 10 civs+. Secondly, no anime girl civ but that can be added with mods. Overall, 10/10 would invade France through Belgium again."
23637,It's fun I guess¯\_(ツ)_/¯
23638,"I've been playing Civilization since version 2 came out over 20 years ago.  I was never really a fan of version 3 or 4, but this version made me put away version 2 for good!"
23639,"best Civilization game, best plays after so many years, Civilization V never dies."
23640,"It's not civ 2, but it's super fun"
23641,.
23642,Gandhi can nuke people. 10/10
23643,One of the best strategy games i have ever played. I highly recommend this game if you don't  mind long games.
23644,Tis very gud
23645,"Have you ever needed to be up at 3am for a trip, already packed your stuff and just need a way to burn 12 hours? Well then I'd say play factorio but this game was the first ""Next turn, and why is there sunlight at-it's not 10pm anymore"" game."
23646,"If you like strategy games, Sid Meier's Civilization series will always be fun."
23647,"Amazing games, only down side is time will get away from you!"
23648,Is a very good historical game!!
23649,"just sick, dont play going into an exam season, that's it really."
23650,It's great. it's CIV
23651,"I've only put in 4 hours so far but I can tell it's a fun game you can pour lots of time into with immense replayability,"
23652,"great game, great series, I have played since for 28 years now, starting when I was 12 playing civ 1. Civ 5 is by far the best of the series so far."
23653,Good game.
23654,.
23655,good
23656,"Fun and engaging, however it can become a blackhole."
23657,Still the best Civ (but only with all the expansions)
23658,great game
23659,Love this game!
23660,better than the Civ6
23661,Great game. Hours of fun. Polders!
23662,F
23663,Started a game at 6PM. Ended game at 6AM. No regrets
23664,Muito melhor do que o 6
23665,10/10 would spend 2 hours setting up a multiplayer game again
23666,fire fire FIRE
23667,"The only down side is that once you have ""won"" you still have to wait like another 30 turns for everyone else to admit it.  The end game especially on single player drags on forever.  Other than that, it's a very entertaining game.  Much better than 4."
23668,nice
23669,"I've been a fan of the Civ games for a long time; I think I started with Civ 2. I have a job that requires me to work odd, long hours, so I don't have a ton of times for games, but this is one that is just simple enough that I can jump back into it, but there's enough going on that it keeps me entertained. The graphics are fun and it's a board game style with a lot of moving parts (making it easier for the computer to track). Would definitely recommend."
23670,If you like turned based RPG's this game is 100% for you. Excellent just Excellent!
23671,Absolutely fantastic and addicting! (just one last turn....)
23672,"Great Game, best Civ-Game imo. Overall good map-settings and interesting developments towards different winning options. Science-Win is the easiest though at least at higher difficulties. The AI-Movement and fighting techniques are still strange sometimes."
23673,Had to uninstall this game for a while because I physically couldn't stop myself from clicking the next turn button.
23674,"Try Vox Populus mod, one of best balanced game with that mod"
23675,its good
23676,yes
23677,Best Civ game ever
23678,pretty good for an older game. i play 6 all the time but often come back to 5 when 6 gets a little samey
23679,Civilization has always been a great game in my opinion. Especially if you like strategy. So far with each iteration the graphics have improved along with the gameplay.
23680,Won a cultural victory as the mongols.
23681,love it
23682,Great Game!
23683,..
23684,Fun for when you have someone to teach you the game as you go

23688,I liked most of it except that certain content (religions) and gods and kings would not work on my device.
23689,all my friends have gotten into this game in 2020 and its old but still better then civ 6
23690,10/10 would A-Bomb Ghandi again

23710,It. Is. Fun.
23711,I've loved this game since I bought it. I'm looking forward to buying the new one as well. Overall an amazing series of games.
23712,"It has some glitches in multiplayer. We have to exit, lose a turn, and resume, but it works well enough."
23713,big chungus
23714,"Simply put, Civ V is the greatest 4X game ever made. Each game is completely different than the last and there is some much nuance and strategy which makes it hard to put down."
23715,Fun game makes you think.
23716,its an alright game.
23717,"Great game, so many ways to play and AI is pretty good. I still would play this all day over Civilization 6."
23718,Sid Meier games...always a pleasure.  Used to play the original Civilization when the cities was a pixilated white block with a number on it!
23719,Worth everything I payed
23720,its a good game to play with ur friends
23721,YES
23722,The best of the best for strategy. The fact that it's survived 5 sequels without any slowdown should show you- Civilization is a top-tier game for all ages and eras.
23723,It's nice.
23724,Brilliant. Just brilliant
23725,its ok i suppose
23726,nice game
23727,i cant stop play this game
23728,Ah yes I shall slaughter all other empires with my mass amount of gold.
23729,very epic

23747,its good for something chill to do alone.  I miss my shadow priest still.
23748,"A really dumb game, two step backwards from Civ IV. Building caravansarays and stables in XXI century cities, leaders look the same in all ages (in barbarian clothes), saying the same one phrase each time. Useless Great Merchants when there are no city states. Dumb AI, even on the highest difficulty levels. Inconsistent AI leaders, that go from Hostile to Friendly in one turn (and vice versa). Endless caravan management. Prophets and missionaries ignoring closed border and blocking all titles - no other way to get rid of them except declaring a war. Some achievements do not work (like full explore Freedom track), etc. etc."

23751,super game ! Better than Civilization 6

23754,Just play it. Is goo
23755,"The best ""One more turn"" game on steam. Although civ 6 was greate and all, civ 5 with all of its dlc is still better imo. 
Btw, been running this as of late on my Linux pc using proton and it just works on there aswell. So 5/5."
23756,based
23757,It's civ v
23758,"Does not run on Win 10 64bit anymore. Invested two hours trying to get the game running. I have hundrets of old games, which run perfectly, but not this one.

Edit: tried to install once again and now it suddenly works - although i didn´t do anything!"
23759,incredible game
23760,Franchise gets worse with every new one.  Design to encourage a certain playstyle keeps this game boring.

23763,"I mean, I could take it or leave it."
23764,i loved it
23765,The best of all Civs.

23778,"What can I say?  I am endlessly invested in taking over the world. :)

In all seriousness, though, this is a fun game to kill many, many, many hours."
23779,"Having played Civ 6 for several hundred hours, i'm back to this classic!  While 6 had some interesting features...honestly i love the feel of 5 a whole lot better.  The leaders look more realistic, and overall everything is more realistic looking in this vs 6."
23780,great turned based civ builder.have been playing for years and keep coming back.
23781,yea its pretty fun
23782,"If you like strategy games, you will love this game. I started playing Civilization years ago, and every improvement I wished for eventually became a reality in this version."
23783,"Very in depth and takes a lot of time, great for single player"
23784,"Fantastic game!  Many possible play experiences and outcomes.  Prepare for moderately long sessions.  ""Just one more turn... ""  Good times and well designed."
23785,nekad je bio hram
23786,"My only beefs are:
1- I find the city-states more annoying than interesting.
2- My empire has a functional maximum number of cities.  I mean, don't they understand that I brook no dissent and MUST RULE THE WHOLE WORLD??

Other than these two faults (perhaps they are personality faults...) the game is excellent!"

23812,"Played since the beginning, I love this game!"
23813,its good
23814,One of the greats. Do yourself a favor and listen to the Brave New World from the OST. Beautiful game all around. Civ6 has nothing on this.
23815,ez good game
23816,"very complex game, fun to play and hard to master"
23817,"I left the dog outside for six hours straight because I was in a war with an empire that if I took over would guarantee my victory in the game. Sorry derek, sometimes there's nothing more important in life than Civilization."
23818,Best game
23819,This game is so addicting
23820,"Fun game to waste hundreds of hours of your life in. Beautiful UI, beautiful maps, great music. Overall, super comfy aesthetic. Makes me happy (unlike the UI of games like War Thunder or Hearts of Iron IV which gave me depression). Only drawbacks mechanically are the global civilization happiness system & gold can just buy you city state friends. Various mods fix this, though, most notably the Vox Populi bundle of mods & fixes!"
23821,"Because some days, Civ VI just won't cut it, and Civ IV is too hard to get into~!... And also dated as crap. At this rate Baba Yetu may be the only thing Civ IV has over V."
23822,Classic game that everyone should play
23823,Turn based empire building game that has enough variation to always stay interesting.
23824,Great time killer game. Plenty to keep you coming back even with some great mods out there.
23825,10/10 would nuke again
23826,I don't know how to win but it's still fun
23827,epic
23828,good

23830,Neat
23831,"Those of you who have not played this gem need to play it! I have sunk more hours into this game than any other strategy game, to date it is still my favourite of the Civilisation series. Play with friends play with ai, play with hundreds of unique mods. If you do pick up civ 5 know that the dlc's make the game even better, to cherry pick the ones to get are Gods and Kings and Brave Knew World. I think my overall play time is close to 800 hours.. maybe I should play something else... wait just one more turn."
23832,yeah man
23833,quite epic
23834,"Easily one of the best games I've ever played.
If you're interested in buying this game you should also buy the dlc because they're really worth it. You don't need all of them but Brave New World & Gods and Kings make the game so much better."
23835,Its CiV. Set a timer so you don't play all night.
23836,"I have the complete bundle but since I have it I can no longer add it to my cart and gift it to a friend and it's only 30 euros now! Thanks for not letting me play with my friends!
P.S. Otherwise the game is awesome, way better than Civ 6"
23837,LITERALLY DA BEST GAME EVER!
23838,Game keeps  crashing after 360 turns on Immortal

23840,"It has a steep learning curve but once you get it, you hardly want to play anything else. It will also increase your GK on the side as an added bonus."
23841,Just one more turn
23842, great game play s good
23843,"Just one... more... turn...

Civ V is an amazing game. Things to know if you're new to Civilization:

- The game likes to show off cutscenes to make it look more impressive. Ultimately, this game is a top down, turn based RPG about country building. Don't be mislead on what kinda game it is.
- The game is super versatile. There's many countries you can play as, many different maps (typically randomly generated), and multiple victory conditions. You can go for a military conquest or you can play for diplomatic victory or just be the most advanced civilization. The replay value is utterly amazing.
- The duration of each game varies, but is usually measured in a single digit number of hours.
- Note that the game can get a bit more tedious late game. Often by mid-game, you can expect to be in the lead and thus everything else feels like you're just ""going through the motions"". As well, by late game you probably have so many units to control that things feel more tedious.
- Difficulty levels on AI is... complicated. The AI is relatively smart compared to most games, but overall it's still pretty dumb. Eventually you'll get good enough that on equal footing, you can always beat the AI. Thus, harder difficulties have the AI cheat.
- The game is moddable. At some point, definitely look up the overhaul mods that breath fresh life into the game.
- The game is surprisingly addictive. Once you get into it, you can expect time to fly because you're having fun.
- Be sure to try various different things to make the games unique. Eg, try starting a military conquest as early game as you can. Try being a turtling pacifist until late game. Try diplomatic and cultural victories. Recommendation: always disable time victory because it's boring.

For returning players (from Civ IV):

- One unit per tile is the best gameplay change ever. It's so simple, but it's definitely for the better. The game is much more strategic as a result. The downsides are that the AI doesn't know how to use it well and it can make moving units more tedious.
- Hexagon grid is fantastic."
23844,i love this series period. recommend this one before 6 tho forsure.
23845,good
23846,classic!
23847,i love hating this game
23848,love it
23849,Been playing Civ for over 20 yrs
23850,sexy game
23851,This is a great game
23852,Such a fun game and easy way to pass the time. You can make it as easy or as difficult as you like and the strategy is fun to experiment with. No 2 games are the same. Can't wait for Civ VI
23853,哀吾生之须臾，羡长江之无穷
23854,noice
23855,"Chilled, epic strategy game"
23856,JUST ONE MORE TURN I SWEAR...
23857,At some some point it just becomes mindless clicking but fun game
23858,Bots can be kinda rude. decent game
23859,greatest game ever
23860,Just...One...More...Turn...(12h later) This is actually the last trun...
23861,yes
23862,Is good. yes.
23863,"I bought this game along with the expansions ages ago on a whim thinking I'd give it a go with no expectations of getting as invested as I am, and I will add that I am horrifically bad at this game, as I am with most if not all strategy games, but I have still somehow sunk 60 hours in it so far. 

I do not remember these 60 hours passing, and the ""1 more turn"" mentality is great up until you realise it's 3am and you've just declared war on someone for something as simple as sending a great prophet to your city.

My lack of sleep and overuse of caffeine aside, this game has done the following to justify a positive review;
- Taught me more about geography and history than any teacher could have.
- Made me realise that achievement hunting was overrated anyway.
- People really like my blue jeans and my pop music.
- Cute fox sprites."
23864,RULES!
23865,"The best game in the franchise. Changing to allow for only a single unit per space is huge, and allows for a more immersive tactical experience in warfare. The Brave New World expansion is critical to have, as the government trees give you a ton of different options for late game. I personally enjoy the play the world mod, as I love BIG maps, and with 22 civs spanning the world in true start locations, you really feel like you're running an empire."
23866,ss
23867,fun
23868,"Do you want to be the god emperor of a world-spanning civilization?

Buy this game then."
23869,Yes

23882,"This game is time Consuming. or maybe i play marathon, so I dunno... Its a turn- based game. 
Game mechanics is linear in progression... mostly you need to keep up when behind and... maybe fun to play in multiplayer."
23883,gd game
23884,"I actually had no idea what I was doing and I only played it with friends 

Still was fun nuking said friends, ""alliance"" is just a word"

23894,This game is like Minecraft... Its nostalgic and fun
23895,Amazing game. Probably the first one I got on steam. This game is great and I believe that it is better than its sequel

23904,"It give you so much different ways to play the game, with e.g. win conditions, map conditions, advanced settings etc. so it feels like you will never exhaust the game. And if feel like you have, the community has produced incredible mods, ranging from Lord of The Rings to Star Wars."
23905,Addictive and so much fun
23906,This game puts you into an instant flow state.
23907,"Fun game. I'm bad at games in general, but this was still fun. It's given me a good representation of what I can imagine running an imperialist nation would be like."

But, this game, I have played it for 100 hours. I stop. Played it again till 200 hours. Stop. 250 hours. Stop again...and now I am playing it again just because.
Heck...back in Civ2, I could play from 11 AM to 10 PM (it was summer...so it didnt get dark)."
23917,Amazing

23928,One of the best games i've ever played
23929,"its a great game. Love the strategy
"
23930,I have played much longer on this game than Steam records because I still have the original Disks for this title. I just bought on steam to always have a copy of one of my favorite games. I have been playing the series since the original Civ came out and played every single version that has come out. While Civ V does have it's share of cons the pros have always out weighed them in my opinion. Love setting this game to Marathon and cranking up the difficulty. An amazing challenge everytime.
23931,"I played a good 170 hours before thinking ""this is getting a bit stale, I'll try it with some mods"" so I think that's pretty good going."
23932,i eat sleep and shit Civ V
23933,best one so far! dont like the new one at all
23934,Just one more turn I swear!!!!
23935,Great game. 10/10. Good balance of realism and fun factor. Very insightful.
23936,I like having tanks before the AI has steel
23937,"Should be required for all High School students to understand the complexity of government, international relations, and finance."
23938,Great game!
23939,"amazing game, tho it gets a bit messy when it comes to multiplayer, by that i mean the turn base thing..."
23940,impossible to stop playing once you begin your journey to take over the world

23950,"The best ""One more turn..."" experience."
23951,Fuck you Atun
23952,"Want a game where you'll forget time exists, become a hermit and not trust even your closest friends constantly living in fear that their nation is spying on you? Get this game"
23953,Very fun. Much joy.
23954,"I played 1 game and it took a bit too long, but it was fun nonetheless"
23955,"The best way to ruin your friendships in multiplayer, but in a fun way."
23956,Love the depth of the gameplay. I still don't know how it all works. Keeps the game mysterious.
23957,"Really good game to get with a group of friends; its like a historically based game of monopoly, ruining friendships and starting rivalries in the best of ways. Wanna see the world burn? Play some Civ. Wanna introduce your friends to your lord and savior so-and-so with the force of a crusade and the fervor of a Johavah's Witness? Play some Civ. Wanna be a hermit and go live on some Island alone. You won't win, but you can do it."
23958,not gonna lie its pretty dandy
23959,team mate bully simulator
23960,yup
23961,Better that Civ 6. Get brave new world on sale. 9/10 very good.

23967,good game
23968,DENMARK STOLE MY BANANAS!
23969,My favorite thing about this game is that it's fun to play for ten minutes or for six hours straight.
23970,"I have probably spent way too much time playing this game, but it has always been a good way to wind down for me.  Very fun and continues to be so years after I started playing it."
23971,"the civ line of games are bar none the best strategy games there are
"
23972,Fun game to sink a few hours into.
23973,Thumbs down because the game was removed from GeForce Now.
23974,"very relaxing, but also a little addicting.  I like the fact that you can play alone, and still partner with other 'players' in the game.  I also like that there are numerous ways to win, not just through superior military"
23975,"Great game if you want to get lost for a few hours and get mad why the A.I HAD to build that wonder just one turn before you'd finish it. 

Also a fun multiplayer experience, especially with friends. Easy to get into."
23976,Yes it's good my friend gets fucked by the religion of hentai everytime
23977,great game

23979,Amazing as always.. Thank you Mr. Meier!

23981,good time sink
23982,Perhaps the best Civ in my opinion
23983,just yes
23984,Great game to play.
23985,Great game
23986,"Quite the bean, really. PRIVY."
23987,well its good
23988,_
23989,"I would recommend this game... At least try it - it's easy to learn how to play, relaxing and pretty much exciting. Personally i like starting stage the most - choosing wich leader you will be, founding cities, discovering map and another civilizations around you... 
Also can say that this game is pretty time consuming. It's not something you can play for 15mins and log off. To start it properly it will take at least an hour or two. But it's totally worth it. :)"
23990,gewd
23991,Amazing game.
23992,Better than civ 6
23993,"This is still the best part from the series. Just relax, and play."

24002,"a god tier strategy experience that has lasted me since 2013. The game can get stale, but its nothing that mods cant fix."
24003,Thank you; very cool.
24004,It's become my go to game before going to bed. I don't sleep much.
24005,good game
24006,Much yes
24007,Its just the tits.
24008,Still the best CIV style Grand Strategy going round. hoping Humankind is more innovative and fun then Civ 6
24009,Addictive.
24010,"Interesting strategy game, though the most strategy I can manage is bloons tower defense 3 level brain power. Just because i'm not good does not mean the game is not though, its amazing.

24017,it slaps
24018,good game g.
24019,Incredible time sink if you need a time sink. I like to take on the personas of my Civ leaders and push through conquering the world while showing mercy to city states

24022,good
24023,good
24024,"Game just got pulled of Geforce Now. It was my go to lunch break game, as Geforce Now burns way less battery than actually running the game on laptop. If you guys are pulling a 10 years old game from the streaming game, then no kudos from me."
24025,just a dang fine game.

"
24033,One of the best Civilization games ever made. Combat is better than the stacks from 4 and all around it feels more polished. My one complaint is with the game AI being not so great.
24034,Awesome
24035,"No brainer.
Smooth.
Good gameplay.
Gimme more of these."
24036,very fun to play
24037,One more turn...
24038,Civ is an incredibly addicting board game.
24039,"Finally Civ has a hexagonal grid making movement more realistic.  However a serious flaw is that worker units cannot be added onto a project to advance it's completion.  This of course is because of the rule that no more than 1 unit is allowed in a hex.  This makes sense for combat units but not workers.  The result is that one of the great pleasures of the other Civs that the rapid development by sending in huge teams of workers is lost.  Until it is fixed, there's little point in playing the game or thinking of getting other Civs."
24040,Was removed from Geforce Now
24041,This game is worse than crack.
24042,"Civ V is the most complete version of the Civilization series, No Firaxis! I wont buy your lackluster Civ VI."
24043,"This one time I started a game of Civilization V and then I ended up taking over control of the western bloc, not in the game but in real life. The physics and realistic feel of this game have brought me closer than ever before to the leaders who have brought us hope for a positive future. Ghenghis Khan, Odu Nabagondu, and Ghandi are to name a few. This game will teach you fairness and how to rule over a country in turmoil, war, and famine."

too easy even on diety to win against bots

its like a quick fart on the consumers... but a game...."

Weather you chose to be an Imperialist pig who is only concred with maxing out your borders or if you want to play as a peace loving Trader. The Choices the game offers and the paths it puts in front of you are numerious and varied. Play as Rome to expand your empire to great lengths. Chose Venice in order to intertiwne the entire world into a web of economic warfare and poltics. Play as the Mongals and destroy your enemy city by city..."

24067,its alright
24068,good
24069,great way to pass the time
24070,it is fun to  play if your in to  types of games that are sentimental
24071,"Civilization V is one of the best strategy games I have ever played with one exception - Civilization VI.  One thing I like about the game is, I don't always win!  That keeps me coming back for more.  Once you play the game you will see what I mean.  I have stayed up most of the night trying to win and sometimes my civilization is victorious and sometimes we are vanquished.  That is life and that is what I like."
24072,"Great concept! Can be as challenging or as easy as you want based on the multitude of game settings. Multiplayer is good if you plan to sit down and play a whole game through, but saving and resuming multiplayer games is super glitchy and almost impossible."
24073,"This is Civ 5, which is better than Civ 4, and better than Civ 6. Actually in my opinion, the only Civ game better than Civ 5 is Civiliziation 1 for the MSDOS. But that's just because I am a DOOMer boomer."
24074,Awesome game in the turn based strategy category. I like the way game is designed and i also purchased the civilization 6 to continue with the franchise.

24084,'s alright

24109,"One of the best games I've ever played. It's a great introduction to the grand strategy genre, and Civ V is easy to learn (although it takes time), yet very hard to master. Even with the hours I've put into the game I have lots of trouble beating higher levels game and I still have a lot to learn, but it all feels fair. This is of course until you put it on the hardest difficulties, which will give the AI unfair advantages. Multiplayer servers aren't perfect but for the most part they work fine. Also, the mod support for the game can keep it interesting if you ever get bored of it, but even when I had times where I didn't want to play that feeling typically went away quite fast. Civ V is truly a polished game that houses almost no glitches or weird quirks that don't make sense, other than possibly some civilizations being much stronger than others. One important thing is the DLC, and if you get the game you should definitely get all of the add-ons as well. The game is okay without the DLC, but upon purchasing it Civ V becomes an astounding, even genre-defining game. The DLC adds many new maps, civilizations, more policies, religion, tourism, and more. This truly opens up the game and shows the user how good a game can be when developers put true work and care into a game."
24110,10/10 would recommend
24111,"Fun game by itself, made a thousand times better with friends."
24112,classic
24113,It's alright i guess
24114,great game best one theyve made
24115,
24116,10/10
24117,always a fun time if youre trying to kill time
24118,"After all these years, still my favorite.

10/10 would trample that punk Alexander into the dust again."
24119,"If you use mods, this game can get very in depth, but it also feels a bit watered down and over simplified compared to Civ 4. The only thing I dislike is that there is no globe view like in civ 4, even though it had its own small problems. I do need to say that the Hex grid is infinitly better than the square grid."
24120,a classic
24121,It Good
24122,Best game of all time! You can spend a lot of thousand of hours into it and still not get bored. So many different Civilizations to play with and each one has a different strategy! Favourite game ever! Totally recommend it.
24123,cool g4m3
24124,You forget you have other things to do besides have a nuclear arms race with Ghandi.
24125,"I had no problems with this one. Is ok, think I still prefer Civilization 3, but would play this one again"
24126,love it
24127,good game
24128,you can play this for houers alone or with friends and u will forget time and escape into this game 10/10
24129,It's okay
24130,pretty cunkin'
24131,I spent 450 hours on this game which I could have spent on something more productive.....
24132,Yes.
24133,"This game is amazing, The graphics the just overall level of the game is FANTASTIC!!!"
24134,"The game has been out 10 years, and I still enjoy it!  Just one more turn..."
24135,
24136,definitely the best game in the world!
24137,Best Civ ever made
24138,"I am not good at Civilization V, and I never will be. To be truly good requires a constant, scrutinous watch of all your cities, units, citizens, and resources and micromanaging them to obtain the upmost efficiency in whatever victory goal you are trying to achieve. Part city planner, part diplomatic negotiation simulator, and part turn-based wargame, Civ. V's gameplay systems are well designed and fun to play, and both the aesthetic choice and graphic fidelity are colorful and vibrant, staying fresh even after multiple long sessions. Has a bit of a learning curve, and a steep skill cap, but even on lower difficulties offers a fun experience that will last through the ages!"
24139,Love this game! Very addicting.
24140,"A great game to get lost in for hours as you shape the future of your civilization, and in time the world."
24141,i have over 4000 hours played
24142,"best civilization game ever, its not too complicated and its pretty damn fun"
24143,"They push out updates that either make the game unplayable cross platform in multiplayer for mac users, or make the game unable to open on older operating systems. Suddenly my OS is too old to run a ten year old game...really? Forced updates that make a game unplayable is a bad business model."
24144,fun game -   lots of ways to play
24145,"538 hours, what else do you need to know?"
24146,Absolutely everything!
24147,Great Game
24148,"I absolutely love this game, gameplay is fun and entertaining..."
24149,You either have a life or you play Civ5. Choose wisely.
24150,yes
24151,one of the best
24152,mm
24153,"I like this better than VI. My favorite was Call to Power, but I thoroughly enjoy Civ V."
24154,just a good game to spend hours sitting on your butt playing
24155,It's so good that I am happy when I play it.
24156,love it
24157,Fun with the expansions if you have a consistent group to play with
24158,Since time immemorial...
24159,is fun
24160,"If you like strategy games I think it's just a good game. Personally this is the game that converted me to disliking strategy games to looking for the newest one. 

Though I do have to admit, without it's major DLCs then I wouldn't have played this game as much as I have"
24161,very nice
24162,best civ
24163,The gold standard
24164,It's a very fun game to come back to still and I highly recommend trying this version or the next.
24165,"This is the only game I play. I suck but I have logged 700 hours over the years. I sometimes open it just for the sake of it, only to close the it after the intro. Civ 5 isn't a game to play, it is a religion to be practised. I had never played a previous instalment and I will never purchase Civ 6, 7, or 8 because there is no point as Civ 5 is perfect. This is the only product I have ever reviewed. 

Excuse me, I have been upgraded from a scout to an archer, and now I have a long trip back home. YNWA."
24166,"A really fun and time consuming game that has so many things to do in it. Has so many directions to take, and game play will be different every time you start a new game due to the amount of different civilisations that are available for to play as or play against. The maps are also randomly generated with different biome tiles, resource tiles and natural wonders scattered across the maps. You can also download so many mods to use if you ever get bored of the normal game."
24167,"It's civ, WHat isn't there to like?"
24168,great game
24169,This game is the bomb!! Had a righteous time playing
24170,I have played every version of Civ from Civ1 to now (including some of the non-canon versions) and this continues the greatness. Plus I just love ranged combat...
24171,Hooked
24172,"it challenging makes you think 
"
24173,"The best educational, strategical step by step game. I am playing this game for almost 30 years."
24174,Bruh. I played 3000 hours. So good.
24175,penis phlem
24176,מעניין כל שנייה
24177,Best game for when you are hungover or tired.
24178,It's really dope basically
24179,i dislike the anime posts but the game is rather splendid!
24180,its ok
24181,CIV V WITH THE BRAVE NEW WORLD EXPANSION PACC
24182,I Hate Grandi XDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD
24183,"WTF is this game supposed to do?  After playing 1 turn, it takes 45 minutes to 8 hours to process the next turn? POS game, avoid at ALL costs unless you want your system running at 100% for 8 hours or so just to process one turn."
24184,.
24185,its lit
24186,It's pretty good I guess
24187,"Very good game. I love it. So many conquest ways, so many rulers to play, so many different strategies. Its always fun no matter how much I play it. One of my favorites. Want an awesome game that can keep you busy for hours, weeks, months? Play this."
24188,The DLC make it a completely different game.
24189,:)
24190,Nearly as addictive as Civ 3 but with a ton more options so that you're not just repeating the last game.  More variety in cultural bonuses.  This game has eaten a lot of my life.
24191,big brain game play venice
24192,"great game, great mods"
24193,Great game. Always entertaining!
24194,Game good.
24195,"Strategy, history, tactics, analysis."
24196,"Another wonderful Civ. I enjoy the endless playability of the game, while still staying true to its civ roots."
24197,would recommend this game more than my gf
24198, I like the real look of the terrain and figures  I did not like the fact that you can not be a unknown leader
24199,Great game!
24200,"Civ 5 is truly the peak of the Civilization Series, bringing together all the best features of games past and using them to propel the series forward. Experiences can range from quick, casual easy sessions to challenging, drawn-out endeavors requiring the utmost skill. The many ways to tailor every mechanic to pursue your chosen victory, whether that be diplomatic or... less so, means that every game you play will end up different than the last."
24201,"SM's-Civ V ... This is the game I've played most of all. I enjoy the simplicity of it. There's many options to steer you're civilization. You only need to use you're mouse, to point and click. ""Hot Seat"" is an affordable multiplayer option. (Take turns on one PC)."
24202,yes
24203,this shit nice
24204,It's one of those tactics and strategy games where it's better with friends but there's quite a few bugs that hinder the amount of fun you get when playing.
24205,"Late game multiplayer becomes EXTREMELY laggy on Standard sized maps and greater. Other than that, a lot of fun."
24206,"Low system requirements. 
Beginner friendly. As casual or hardcore as you want it to be.
Inexhaustible gameplay diversity and replayability. 
Mods and configuration. Beautiful soundtrack.
You will get more than your money's worth even at full price and it won't cost you hundreds like Crusader Kings."
24207,Higher level proves to be a pisser....lol
24208,"In my opinion, compared to civilization 6, its just a better game. so easy to pick up. enough strategy to keep you engaged. I do like the new policies in civ 6 and the new ""districts"" they added in, but civ 5 allows you an insane amount of freedom in that regard. Are you surrounded by rowdy neighbors who are quick to declare war? build your mega city surrounded by defensive cities to protect it better. I just wish they would of stayed to this formula and added weather and disasters. that would of been the best option 10/10"
24209,If you got friends this game is really fun and chill. Must have patience though
24210,"Don't usually like strategy games that much, but my Egyptians have destroyed China, the Iroquois and are now breaking down Japan and I've never been happier."
24211,hell yeah i love taking over the world
24212,I kill fu k u napolean hehe
24213,"Doesn't need a review, just a 1600 hours thumbs up."
24214,"An old game at this stage, but an absolute time sink!"
24215,So much better than Civ 6
24216,more fun than 6
24217,fun
24218,I like turn based games vs. first person shooter.
24219,i have a pig benis
24220,This game with its turn based style is addicting
24221,"Awesome fun!
"
24222,it's really good!!
24223,gud
24224,It's Civ just buy it already. Seriously like why do you need to read reviews when it already has a ginormous reputation. STOP READING get it noooooow!!!! DO IT OR GHANDI BOMBS U
24225,"this game is so good that i pooped my pants several times while playing very good game would play again 


p.s i now have to change my pants again because i liked my own review so well"
24226,"1. Started a Huge game as the Germans
2. Somehow found and then monopolized 90% of the Gems and Gold luxury.
3. Became filthy rich through trading luxury items and sucking up to Mercantile city states
4. Switches trading luxury for horses.
5. Trains Cavalry
6. Invades country with Cavalry to reclaim luxury and keep horses
7. Continues strategy for 400 more turns (switching horses for oil eventually)
8. Is obscenely wealthy and controls most of the world save for 2 countries and half a dozen city states.
9. Has a monopoly on almost all strategic and luxury resources.
10. Realises I totally forgot to control uranium or enact Nuclear Non Proliferation
11. Gets nuked by the Russians who are furious for my continued appealing of their proposals and an embargo
12. Russians have amassed a surprisingly large army with their remaining oil and rubber
13. Gets invaded by Russian Marines and Modern Armor.
14. Most of my army is far from the border to the north due to the southern forces being vaporised by atomic fire.
15. Sends massive reinforcements to the south.
16. Pushes back the Russian army.
17. Bulk-produced and purchased workers start to clean up pollution and repair improvements.
18. Main army is built back to previous strength.
19. Invasion of Russia begins
20. Russian defence is incredibly lacklustre due to most units being killed
21. Ensuing battles end with the capture of 6 Russian cities
22. My forces start to close in on the capital 
23. Also realise I forgot to deal with the insane amount of tourism France has generated due to being the only non-war torn country left on the planet, save for the Assyrians who haven't grown in 300 years.
24. France wins a cultural victory

10/10 would play again

10/10 would play again"
24227,"I liked this game A LOT, it has a bunch of civilizations that best fits your game style, the only thing is that I get really hungry for burgers when playing...
"
24228,"A perfect introduction to Strategy games, Simple, Fun, and easy to learn."
24229,"Wars in this game are super intense, I don't ever look for them but when another civ disturbs your cultural/scientific research with a war. The conflict itself is very real and intense for you, and you end up growing to hate this civ and it feels either super scary when you are losing, or super gratifying when you eventually defeat them."
24230,good
24231,great game
24232,"Still like it better than Civ VI, even with it's limitations."
24233,Live out your fantasy of exploring and then conquering an infinite number of Earths.
24234,kinda fun
24235,big big fun fun yeas
24236,It's good i guess
24237,Entire game 10/10
24238,i like graphics and animations. best CIV game

24240,"I play it occasionally, it`s so not addictive."
24241,"I was introduced to this game through friends and eventually played it for myself and I can say it's a game not for everybody. I'm not sure, there's so many problems and nitpicks I have with this game and yet it's brought so much joy to me. It's incredibly fun to play with friends but here's an issue. The online play, sucks. Look I'm gonna saw this game is perfect at what it does (building your own nation, following paths to success, etc) but the online can be a problem for many. (Note: Recently I heard mods aren't working)"
24242,the potential to build the best working civilization
24243,"The game isn't very deep.  It is fun though, and very replayable."
24244,"easily one of the best strategy games of the decade or perhaps of all time, if you get into making your own civs and adding small quality of life mods its even greater. what other game can you play as shrek where you fight off hitler and the my little pony horde to unify the world as a swampy paradise. not into crazy mods, well theres unique scenarios built in and plenty of civs to interact with. you can get nuked by ghandi, get invaded by montezuma on turn 3, all sorts of fun stuff."
24245,"Great game and good price
"
24246,"Sid Meier's Civilization V is the greatest casual strategy game ever made.

Among strategy games, it may not have the best graphics, or be the most realistic, but it's accessible, well-polished fun nonetheless."
24247,A goody but an oldie. I had so many hours entertainment playing this. I will still recommend it even though it has been surpassed by Civ VI
24248,shove your reviews up your ass gabe
24249,lots of memes to be created and its worth it lol
24250,"*Breathes*
Polynesia denounces you!
Russia wants horses
Siam wants you to stop settling cities near them
""Would you be interested in a trade deal with England?""
Japan has declared war on you!
Salt is banned!
Assyria demands all of your resources in exchange for one piece of furs
""Venice is actually God tier, guys!""

And then Ghandi nukes you."
24251,It's fun
24252,Cu
24253,"If you've ever wanted a way to make 8 hours of the day magically disappear, Civ V is the game for you."
24254,"Hours of game play, lots of options to customize play.  Not a fast paced game, good for a long zone out session, or to play a few turns here and there while multitasking."
24255,Stands the test of time. Still my favorite Civ game by far. Strongly recommend.
24256,Good
24257,Great game to play with some friends. Bit of a learning curve - be prepared to scrap your first game after 100 turns or so when you realize your starting zone is trash and you made every mistake possible. But after you have a few under your belt there are few games that are better to sink a day into.
24258,"Hours turn into days, turns keep passing by."
24259,great game
24260,Civ
24261,its cool
24262,"The best Civilization by far, I just wish it interfaced better with Windows 10 and Direct X 10/11. It is unfortunately unstable if the game is play with DX 10/11. Otherwise I prefer this version over all especially the new Civ 6."
24263,The Russians would say it's a 3.6....I say the guage stops at 3.6 but reads higher
24264,yes!
24265,epic
24266,"Would recommend to anyone interested in a long-term, commitment-type strategy game.  Similar to risk."
24267,Easily the best entry into the civilization franchise.
24268,Its just fun delveloping a nation to destory everyone else then ruling their home lands
24269,Great game! Nice to zone out on :-)
24270,An excellent game great fun alone and with friends.
24271,What else is there to say it Civ 5
24272,"Absolutely perfect, imbalances you can exploit to own the game, sure, but you can also just have a joyride down a different street"
24273,"Relatively good strategic game with limited AI.  It's all all a balancing act but that can be fun.
"
24274,I believe it to be the best turn-based strategy game I have ever played!
24275,
24276,"Somehow, they think I need to repurchase a game I have owned and played for over 129 hours. Hard pass if that is the shady business practices this company wants to implement."
24277,Very good game
24278,"Great game! The stand-out 4X game, the gold standard. After you beat it, I highly suggest you try giving mods a try! Some completely change the game balance (for the better, imo), like Vox Populi. You can also add your favorite fictional civs (tons of skyrim mods for this game). You'll love it if you love strategy games."
24279,sss cool
24280,"[b]Me, 1am:[/b] ""One... more... turn...""
[b]Me, after one turn:[/b] ""Oh, it's 7am already. I should go to sleep. Well, after I've finished this building!"""
24281,Do it its great
24282,突然就早上了
24283,yes
24284,Still great.
24285,good game
24286,Way too fun. Almost get no sleep because I gotta take just one more turn.
24287,This game got me hooked. I can literally play for hours. RIP social life but worth it.
24288,"Classic but with some retarded bugs and happiness luxury spam isnt that fun.

Civ 6 is better but I think we all have fond memories of this game"
24289,"Great game, I have Civ VI and I prefer this. Favourite thing to do is play on marathon speed as it really feels like your telling a story of how the Greeks who spawned in South America conquered the world with nuclear hellfire and building a very long road from the bottom of South America all the way up to the top of Canada, which on marathon speed can really take a long time. Also diplomatic victory is the best way to win."
24290,"fun game, you will lost track of time with this"
24291,Jo. i like it.
24292,great civ one of the best made 6 never will come close to what made 5 one of the best civ to ever be made
24293,"One of the best and most addicting grand strategies out there. It is easy to learn and once you start a game, you will spend hours trying to build your empire and and win the game. A game can take anywhere from 6 to 15 hours depending on the game speed and with 60+ civilizations to play with (With DLC), randomly generated map, countless mods and along with dozen of scenarios. You could play for thousands of hours and still find new things about the game."
24294,Its a classic.  Some glitching with worker resource allocation led to me not playing much.  Figured it was a glitch and would be easily fixed.  Haven't played in a few years and will send in a report if glitch still occurs.
24295,"Dabs on 6 every day
"
24296,It's something that really makes you think about why our world has become the way it is.  It puts you in positions and forces you to make tough choices in the mid to late game.  Very interesting.
24297,Relaxing game
24298,<3
24299,fun
24300,V > VI
24301,This game is a great game for learning how to take over the world.
24302,I like
24303,"The move to hexagons is a very welcome change. As is with most Civ games, wait until you get all of the expansions."
24304,it's great
24305,great game!!!
24306,Great game makes time fly by
24307,"Great Game. I was a little put off by the original Civilization, and had been largely ignoring the franchise for a long time. I didn't know what i was missing. A family member suggested that I try Civ 5, and I was hooked. The format is great, the game play fluid, and the replay value is high."
24308,"Replayability is very high, i enjoy the mechanics of Civ 5 more than Civ 6, just an all around good game"
24309,Great game if you have a lot of time. Love it!
24310,
24311,Dope fucking game that will eat a day before you notice.
24312,Its fun for an hour or two...
24313,Great way to spend countless hours. I don't know how many hours I've thought were mere minutes just to realize I should have slept 4 hours ago... 10/10 great game best experienced with mods!
24314,great game
24315,THIS GAME NEVER ENDS! CAN YOU SURVIVE... JUST... ONE... MORE... TURN!?
24316,Its an amazing game.
24317,crazy
24318,No 2 games are ever the same and the exploration at the onset is the most fun.  Then end game can get a bit predictable but still fun.
24319,"it be good, have 486 hours and still not good
















:)"
24320,One of the best civilization games to play.
24321,Mouse pointer stop at beginning if game and stays lost.
24322,Great game
24323,"Excellent game never gets tired (800+ hours). A little slow to learn the ropes but after a few play-throughs the game is awesome. My favorite Civ game, over Beyond Earth and Civ 6. Great DLC content through ""God's and Kings"" and the other one too. Civ packs arent exactly worth it unless you really want Poland or Vikings, certainly neither are my favorite Leaders. Sometimes I get bored after a long game but I always keep this game downloaded, its still fun 4-5 years after I bought it."
24324,I could really go for some tacos right meow.
24325,"This game is great, but recommending it to other people feels kinda like suggesting they try heroin"
24326,"it ok
"
24327,Get boring
24328,mendigo
24329,Best hot-seat strategy multiplayer game on steam.
24330,"By adding a few mods, this is the best Civ version to play currently.  The newest Civ is overpriced garbage."
24331,Another solid entry in the Civilizations franchise!
24332,it's freaking addictive. If you have other stuff to do don't start playing cause you won't be able to stop
24333,Dont Play Venice other than that its pretty epic
24334,always enjoy Civ games and this one is great.
24335,"multiplayer is really nice, you can play for hours without the game becoming boring. even in singleplayer there are several missions you can play to challenge yourself."
24336,This is a great game whit lots of hours to spend. Had hoped that the new Civilization VI was an improvment but it was not. Civilization V is Still the Best game
24337,great strats and endless game play
24338,in all my time i have finished 2 game
24339,its good
24340,good
24341,goood shit
24342,addicting. good installment in the series. large amount of customization options and lots of scenarios to play out.
24343,It's Pretty Good
24344,Really Great game and a great way to pass the time.
24345,Easily one of my favorite games and an equally bigger time sinker.
24346,Awesome Game
24347,"you could play this game forever, or at least for 1 hundred years before it got old."
24348,She gudd
24349,uwu
24350,"this game goes so freaking slow, and it comes almost to a hault. maybe its cuz im bad, who know i might change this later on. not hard to wind, but tedious"
24351,Sick game!
24352,Very good.
24353,Easy to play
24354,"Great fun with friends! Large attention span is needed, though."
24355,its pretty good
24356,sick
24357,Good
24358,so u start to play this game 5 pm after a while u want to check the time its 5 again so u feel good but then u realize its 5 am  this game is f**king cool

24361,Great strategy game
24362,Very nice game
24363,"Intelligence is supremely important in a strategy game. Sadly, Civ V like all recent civs has an AI as dumb as a brick providing no challenge."
24364,Awesome turned based game. So much replay value!
24365,I have 850+ hours in this game for a reason
24366,Great game
24367,"I first played civ 17 years ago with my father. He left my mother and I a week later, citing ""that Ghandi arsehole"". 3/5 I would indeed like a trade agreement with England"
24368,Good game.  Lots of battles and strategy.
24369,"I play solitare, not multiplayer, and so the AI for computer opponents is critical to game enjoyment. The difficulty levels simply accelerate the building of military units for AI players and that becomes too difficult to overcome at the highest difficulty levels. Rather, it would be better to have difficulty levels modulate how intelligent and aggressive the military units are used."
24370,by far one of my favorite games of all time.
24371,solid game
24372,"Eh, Pretty good."
24373,"Lots  of fun, simple(ish) mechanics, great graphics"
24374,keke
24375,Enjoyed it!
24376,good game
24377,"fun,enjoyable"
24378,"Good mild strategy game, prefer total wars but its a good chill game to play with friends. Thy Tablet Of Stone. is a really good player in this game so go ahead and add him and see if you can beat him."
24379,"The game is good if you get it to work. Ran into troubles after playing 25 hours myself. Some other nations diplomacy screen froze the program and the whole computer. Luckily I found a fix; https://steamcommunity.com/app/8930/discussions/0/864973577951549829/, ""you need to uncheck ""GPU Texture Decode"" in the graphics settings."". This was the last option I tried before giving up. 

Asked for a refund from Steam before this as I tried so much to fix it and hadn't succeeded. They denied me because I had played too many hours. However, you need to play many hours before the error appears. So without this fix the would have basically swindled me of $50. I don't see any advantages now playing via Steam. You might as well get a game directly from the original supplier.

Steam support have known of this issue for over 5 years and haven't found any solution (the one given was from a player) and successfully ignored it.

The game is good and addictive, but there are complications and it's not safe to assume it will work."
24380,"I like
"
24381,its fun!!!!!!
24382,bough the dlc and it didnt work. please go and die in a whole devs you pieces of shit maggots
24383,a
24384,"This is not a game you can play for a quick 30 minutes.

I bought the game. I sat down to start my first match.
9.5 hours later, I was looking at the victory screen, with 10 ideas for how I wanted to play differently next game.
Then I looked that the clock.. slept for 4 hours, woke up with nothing but ideas for Civ on my mind, and then played another 10 hour game.

I then Panicked, told myself I'd quit gaming and put it out of mind, then 4 days later my friend invited me to play multiplayer with him.

Goodbye real life, you will be missed."
24385,Still an amazing game!
24386,One of the best games ever.
24387,First Strategy game i've played. Can't stop playing it!
24388,One of the most addicting games of all time and easily in my top 5.
24389,Just fun
24390,Simply put: one-more-turn-adiction
24391,"

Where did the time go?"
24392,BIG BRAIN GAME GOOD FOR BIG BRAIN HUMAN VERY LIKE MUCH ME GOOD GAME
24393,fun! easier than 6
24394,Great game.
24395,"An entertaining way to keep some of those synapses busy between rounds. 

My only criticism is the inability to stack units . The lack of takes away an element of the game related to organisation. :)\"
24396,This is a game so ha
24397,Nuke
24398,good
24399,classic. very good
24400,Great Game
24401,tis fun.
24402,"So Fun, I have sunk so much time into this game. some ruff spots in the game for sure but dosn't stop you from having a amazing time."
24403,"The clarity of the map, ease of battle which unlike other games does not bog you down in complicated troop movements."
24404,"An addicting game that you will find yourself playing for hours on end. Playing with friends elevates the experience but don't fret, I know you don't have any friends."
24405,"This is the best in the series. There are a lot of different ways to play. Also the mods that others have done make this game truly one that continues to be a new game each time you play. I have play over 1600 hours on this game over the years. I kept coming back to it because it is different each time. If you like empire building, then look no further. Get this one. I also tried civ. 6 but it has like they tried to make it all over and it was a failure from the start. You will not be sorry you purchased this game. Also, check out the mods that others made. They are great ones to some that make you scratch your head. Happy building."
24406,Great turn based strategy game
24407,so much replay value.
24408,s
24409,"Fun game to play either single- or multiplayer. After playing 88 games I know the basics, but I feel like there's always more to learn :D"
24410,quality stuff. what a time to be alive!
24411,"By now a classic staple of the genre of turn based strategy. However you should have the big DLCs at least, as a lot of the depth of the game is in those, and without them the game might seem a bit shallow."
24412,this game sucks cause i cant steam roll people like airman sieger
24413,"If you haven't sunk several hundred hours into this game with the DLC, you're missing out. Even more fun when you get to play with friends."
24414,"Had units next to enemy city, nuked city, lost units. Worth. 10/10"
24415,it's good
24416,"is good
"
24417,Just buy it
24418,y
24419,"It might be a good game, but I'm not quiet sure yet."
24420,"Building a trade posts in jungle is not how science is achieved, this game is insane."
24421,"Such a fun game. Yes, it is a decade old but i can not stop playing."
24422,this is a fun game trevor should buy it
24423,wow
24424,The superior game over Civ VI
24425,better than 6 tbh
24426,"Great game been playing it for years, one of my favorites."
24427,very good game
24428,"fun game, good time. forget about sleep"
24429,Addicting game.
24430,Get Vox Populi Mod for one of the best games ever!
24431,gud game
24432,it was good
24433,just one more turn
24434,"Played a couple of games, it's pretty cool."
24435,good
24436,Better than civ 6
24437,"> owns civ 6
> goes back to civ 5 that's been on steam account for 9 years
> notbad.jpg
> never plays civ 6 again"
24438,dont tell me what to do steam
24439,its a great game
24440,"This was my first Civ since Civ 1. I still go back to it often, what with so many mods available with so many play styles. I'll ""just one more turn"" myself past midnight without realizing it."
24441,Anything you could want in a stone age to modern age game.
24442,Don't Trust Gandhi
24443,"I've put many, many hours into the Civ games over the years.  They're not super flashy, but for those of us who like turn-based strategy, they're still hard to beat.  Every game is different, so replay value is high.  The main issue is that the turns definitely slow down as the game goes on, but it's not too bad."
24444,"Excellent strategy game, lots of features and complex mechanics. Also the Workshop is excellent, allowing you to fully customize your experience and preventing the player becoming bored"
24445,Ncps are boring and 2d.
24446,best strategy game ever!
24447,fuck yes
24448,Just an amazingly thought-out game. Love it
24449,good game ...
24450,bruh
24451,hexagon bee hive
24452,"1. launch game
2. pick poland
3. win"
24453,One more turn.
24454,i
24455,this is where the franchise peaked
24456,"i'VE PLAYED THIS SERIES FROM THE BEGINNING AND THIS IS A GOOD ONE.
"
24457,"turn based light strategy. play online with others OR play without the drama of getting attacked by other people. despite the better graphics of version 6, I personally find the religion aspect of 6 to be too pervasive and I could not find an option to switch it off completely. 5 is still my relaxing timeburner.
"
24458,big cums to my time consumption
24459,"Turn 1: This game is going to be a quick one.
Turn 3487: Oh awesome, we just discovered electricity.
Turn 10284: Oh great, I took over the world.
10/10 would dominate the world again."
24460,fun
24461,best game ever
24462,"It is a great game both as a platform and as stand-alone. Combine community and modding tools — and you get a gem.
We had tons of fun with neighbours in my university's dormitory. Even managed to play with mods together (online).

I haven't really tried DLC's scenarios so can't say if they should be bought as well. If you see a discount on this game, take it (the complete/golden/deluxe/ubermensch/whatever version it's called)."
24463,amzing
24464,"yep would recommend any of the civ games, most are available on steam my personal favorite if you can find it is colonization"
24465,a classic
24466,perfect
24467,"I have had since introduction- never tire of it- so many ways to play the scenes, such a wide choice it never fails for me to enjoy.!!!!
"
24468,just dont forget to hit end turn
24469,"This game is fucking great, it makes me feel stupid as fuck as i get raped by friends who have a higher IQ than me (mine is 1 btw) would give 10 out of 10 fatmans"
24470,one game takes a whole day
24471,Great fun single player and with friends
24472,Civ V. The best strategy game of all times.
24473,One of the best strategy games of all time!
24474,is good game
24475,Must buy if you are interested in a trade agreement with England
24476,.
24477,A time killer
24478,its good i guess
24479,yes
24480,It's fun and complicated enough you can play multiple times without losing interest.
24481,Sid doesnt make a bad game. Hours of fun... no 2 games are alike
24482,"This is an amazing game, you can pick it up for just a couple minutes (or turns) but if you are not careful you will notice its 6 am after you said ""Ill just finish this turn then be done for the night"" at 9 pm.  You can easily sink your entire day into playing this game and be surprised that it has been more than an hour.
Get this game or the newer on, both are great games. As long as you don't buy Civ. 4 you have made a good choice."
24483,"pretty good, game needs a fuel, ration system for troops  and aircraft carriers"
24484,nice
24485,fun
24486,its ok i guess
24487,Pretty good.
24488,Good
24489,"it's easy to lose track of time while playing, that's how good civ v is. Multiplayer has some issues with connectivity but it's still great if you remember to save often. The DLC makes it feel like a whole new game asl well and really reinvigorates interest in gameplay. I just keep coming back to play new scenarios, and not many games get me to keep coming back."
24490,10/10
24491,Quite possibly the ONLY game that has both Civilization AND V. Incredible.
24492,"Of all the games I've played, this is one of them."
24493,Although pretty tough to get to learn how everything works once you begin to devise strategies and build up experience it becomes a very fun competitive game either solo or with friends
24494,:)
24495,pebis
24496,"I started playing this game with friends who were longtime fans. I was not. I bumbled my way through dozens of games with those guys, just clicking the buttons and marveling at the complexity of it all.

590 later....

I am still lost. Halp. 

10/10 would recommend as a way to keep your hands busy while you chat with friends online.
"
24497,get a whole new world expansion for all the best mods
24498,addicting
24499,"The only drawback to playing a CIV game is the ""One More Turn"" disease.

Deffo recommend playing with all the expansions installed (not currently using myself but apparently balances the game!)"
24500,Still the best version of the game.  Also supports touch screen!
24501,BEST VERSION OF CIVILIZATION
24502,"beautiful time waster, great to listen to audio books to while you play"
24503,This game is a masterpiece
24504,Absolutely love this game. I've burnt a ton of hours on this and I'll burn just as many more.
24505,"Don't play this, it will suck you in like $2,000,000 whore, and you will miss out on everything."
24506,this game is very addicting but is  very fun. I've played from when the sun came up to down and back up again with friends.
24507,
24508,"cool game. big life waster
"
24509,Its addicting as heck and pretty fun. You should play it.
24510,This game is a pretty good guy
24511,"Much Cool!
Such Fun!
Very Orgasm!"
24512,"Loved the game, the 700+hours i have put in it should show that, loads of fun, i keep coming back to it again and again even after so long since its release
"
24513,Yeah go on
24514,YOS
24515,"IF you are going to go into a naval war, stick to playing the ottomans"
24516,"This game is literally my second favorite game behind Skyrim, which I've played 862 hours as of writing this. So many scenarios, challenges, and game mechanics to play with that it's infinitely playable. 10,000/10"
24517,i liked it
24518,"Honestly just a great game, so much replayability... hence my current 902 hours."
24519,"Really fun turn based strategy game.  The classic, but with great upgrades!
"
24520,Lot better than Civ 6
24521,Great strategy game played it for hours. It also is quite replayable so you can enjoy it quite a lot
24522,"Arguably the best Civ game? I say yes, by only a small margin outting only Civ 4 Beyond the sword.  What gives this game the edge, is the variety of actions and content to offer.  Everything that you felt was lacking in 4 was completely quenched in 5."
24523,"Gripping, compulsive strategy game. Better than Civ 6 - more intuitive"
24524,loved it
24525,Got to love Civ !!!
24526,"I like the relaxed gameplay. I can play as fast paced or as slow as I want. I can stop when I win the game, any number of ways, or continue on to annihilate all the opposition."
24527,one day the Shoshone people will conquer Pandaria
24528,If you are even somewhat into history civ is a must have.
24529,"Timeless game, love it and the mods created for it!"
24530,I love this game
24531,Excellent Game.  My Favorite in the line of CIV. games...  :)
24532,"Its an awesome game
"
24533,Good Shit
24534,Always a great game if you're too hung over to be capable of doing anything else.
24535,All I can say is I keep coming back to it.  It took me a bit to get used to the interface from IV to this but I like it more now.
24536,"One of those games that you will literally just not be able to stop playing. Once you start, you'll see it through to the end and just keep going ""Just one more turn"""
24537,Amazing playability
24538,.
24539,You can end up spending hours on one campaign. This is also a lot of fun with friends.
24540,Civ 5: Brave New World is the best game in the series
24541,I really enjoy this game. I only play single player or with online friends. I love how easy it is to start a game and the helpful tips when I was learning the game. This by far is my go to game to just have fun if no one is online to play with.
24542,It's still the best Civ game I have ever played. It does endure the test of time.
24543,Great
24544,love it
24545,GREAT GAME
24546,"it ok, play few ti,me (sorry for bda englis))."
24547,"The best civilization game until now. Better than VI, for sure."

"
24549,Game is good.
24550,good
24551,join multiplayer and kick some ass!!!
24552,Love this game! Always a nice relaxing game to play.
24553,still better than 6
24554,super buggy but fun to play when it works
24555,its alright i guess
24556,board game the video game
24557,Fun
24558,This game will ruin your life dont play I lost days of my conciousness to clicking buttons and masterbating
24559,fun game
24560,Quite possibly the most addicting game I've ever played
24561,Yes
24562,3 HOURS OF LISTENING TO MUSIC AND CONQUERING - MAKE SURE YOUR FRIEND PABLO ISN'T USELESS
24563,Great fun if you have the main big DLCs. Turn off score victory cause its terrible. Culture victory is the most fun overall imo. Get it!
24564,yes
24565,civ 5 doesn't work anymore
24566,This is endlessly replayable and has so many different scenarios.
24567,yjouuuuuuuu this game is cooooool!
24568,"good game
"
24569,super sexy characters plus super easy gameplay makes this a great game for private time
24570,This game satisfies world domination  cravings like a cupcake to a sweet tooth.
24571,"The best iteration of the modern Civs (5 & 6). Arguably, once you have expansions, even greater than IV. A true classic."
24572,this game was fun until i had to wait for the shit player himself alamin twagira
24573,Just one more turn.
24574,One of the best strategy games in history - buy with DLC Brave New World
24575,"yes
"
24576,is nice great success
24577,"Hard recommend, but only with G+K and BNW dlc."
24578,"If you like time travel, well, you'll soon realize that tomorrow has arrived and you didn't sleep. ""Just. One. More. TURN."""
24579,GUD
24580,"This game is great, It works well on even some of the most under powered devices"
24581,fix crossplay
24582,this game is just a blast. I play hot seat with my family all the time and we have so much fun. Its not for everyone but if your into stuff with strategy and stuff like that you'll have fun.
24583,kinda epic ngl based no cap
24584,Best time sink I have played in a while!
24585,Great game !
24586,outstainding
24587,"Love Civ 5, great intuitive game play encompasses new aspects of civilizations in relation to the one you own and how you interact with other ones."
24588,It's alright
24589,Good strategy game that is well balanced. Can be a little stale near the end of the game with lots of troop management but the early game more than makes up for it.
24590,Great game to the Civ line but good ol' cheating AI as an answer to increased difficulty is the most crap in the game.
24591,"i love this game and so will you, so just buy it"
24592,One more turn...
24593,5>6
24594,The best turn based strategy game I've ever played !
24595,"lol very epic mr stark

24615,Just. One. More. Turn.

24617,vewy fun and i have an addiction
24618,yes
24619,gud
24620,The stereotype of the civilization player is that they spend hours on it and think only minutes have passed. This review is to confirm that such a stereotype is true and I love this game. Great for long plane/train rides and downtime in general. Couldn't recommend more.
24621,cfghfghnfgn
24622,very Fun.
24623,"This game may seem intimidating at first, but I'm a filthy casual and I love it. There are a lot of levels available when you're playing against NPCs, so it's easy to pick the spot where you're comfortable - whether you want to keep it easy or you need a challenge - and the scope of the game is so big that you feel like you've accomplished something at the end, even on easy. PVP is also very fun, BUT beware, it takes a LOT longer than PVC because of the length of the player turns. On PVC all the computers make their decisions simultaneously and immediately, players (assuming they are all humans or roughly humans and not some experimental AI you've hooked up to the game) take longer to make their decisions and click through their options. Even with just two players and on fast mode, it has taken my sister and I an entire day - around 8 or 9 hours - to complete a game, and we've found it difficult to get back into a saved game as multiplayer, as the computer will try to yank away one person's control and put them immediately on AI."
24624,always loved civs
24625,"Ghandi scares me. I refuse to allow india into my games. 
Im not racist i promise"

24639,Great game
24640,A great low-stress strategy game.
24641,great game for people who like's kingdom rueling games.
24642,Its Awesme!!!!!
24643,"My first 4X game. It holds a special place in my heart for it. It's well-made and can be fun on its own, the realistic art-style can be very engaging, and very challenging depending on the settings. There's lots of good mods for it that improve or change the game entirely to accommodate different tastes. I would definitely recommend it."
24644,got it on sale and it definitely is worth it's money
24645,Great game
24646,"Game is perfect if you want a turn base game that takes a long while

its a hard learning curve but when you get it you will have an absolute blast"
24647,redyut
24648,"Still the best civ in my  mind you cannot go wrong with this one.
So many time night playiing one more turn...."
24649,Known as the best Civ for a reason
24650,i don't usually like turn-based games but this game changed my opinion and now i can't stop playing it. a really good game.
24651,Pretty fun

24653,Still one of the best games ever.
24654,"Just as it has always been, when our memories of the ancient world fade into twilight a new era dawns to fill the void, an unfamiliar path with a pulse of its own, a tempo not dictated by the labor of men but accelerated by the rhythm of machines, launching the world into an age of bold innovation. From this cauldron of steel and sweat a vision of prosperity emerged, Harnessing the untold power of the elements, turning night into day. creating new designs that brought the world stage into to masses, and providing an experience that many could never imagine, The advent of mechanized warfare brought devastation like none the world had ever seen providing a window of opportunity for some to dictate conformity as regimes spread their ideologies with a heavy hand, inciting the world to the brink of war, and yet some chose a different path and through their visions brought unique perspective to the world as singular proponents of free thinking remained striving for peace in their endeavors to unlock secrets of the universe, some of which would fill our hearts with fear and regret. but as this progress unfolds the finite nature of our world becomes clear. our survival, the survival of all the worlds peoples depends on our ability to coexist in peace, but this peace is tenuous. Although mankind will always look onward, yearning for more, searching for new boundaries only to breakthrough them, with the understanding that this world is one in which we all share, comes the responsibility of knowing the decisions you make today will have a lasting impact in the generations of tomorrow."
24655,great game! almost a perfect civ
24656,There are so many ways to play the game I imagine different play styles can find something for themselves.
24657,its really good lol
24658,l
24659,Played this game for years.    Sometimes it even lets me win. It cheats a lot. But I still come back to it.

24717,Best game you can play for hours!

24719,"Hours upon hours of replayability! This game will absorb you, take care of your business prior to starting or you won't come out with a life..."
24720,"Its fun and time consuming. If you like history and its many fascinating differences, i highly recommend this game for you. Of course, there is CIV 6 as well, which might be a better choice"
24721,"yes
"
24722,§beast
24723,good game
24724,"its been interesting so far, the longer the play it the more nuanced I've actually found such an old game.  I love experimenting with Civ builds that shouldn't work and sometimes they do but the screw ups can be just as fun.  
Its a bit slow at times and I know I can speed that up but for now just playing on normal speed is fine.  I even have this one game where I'm playing marathon, its quite a bit different playstyle"
24725,"My favorite Civ game for a number of reasons:

1) Limited AI city spam unlike Civ III
2) Limited army doomstacks unlike Civ IV
3) Civ VI is a solid game, but for the price and performance on older PCs, Civ 5 is my preference."
24726,Really great and worth the money because of how detailed the gameplay is.
24727,its gr8 m8 r8 8
24728,if you don't play this game you're a disgrace to all your friends apparently

24736,"It's Sid V, one of those games that most people that enjoy Chess will also like :)"
24737,I've never had so much consistent fun in a game before. No matter how many times I come back to it I'm reminded just why I love it. It takes a bit to learn but it's worth it.
24738,Its Civilization one of the best game lines out there.
24739,Just one more turn... Like no really this game is so good and addicting it really will feel like one more turn all the time.
24740,"Civ V is really good, got it on G2A for something of 13 bucks, including all the DLC. It's a really good game, and the AI are hilariously bad. Multiplayer is extremely fun though."
24741,bruh its godly
24742,gandhi
24743,its pretty fun
24744,Great game to sit down and play for 30minutes only to realize 6hrs has gone past.

24747,nice
24748,Fun
24749,"Wanted to come back to Civ 5, updated EULA required to continue playing.
Goes as follows:

-We licensed you the privilege to use this software until we say otherwise, you didn't actually purchase anything.
-We own any content you make for this game.
-You agree we don't have to offer you refunds for any reason.

I like the game and don't plan on making any mods but this is still bs. I would like to recommend this game but I can't anymore."
24750,Civ V is a solid strategy game and one of my favourite games to play with friends. Highly recomend.
24751,Yes
24752,Probably at least 200 of my hours were in the summer of 2012.
24753,I like this game
24754,if i ever have nuked a person so much it would be considered genocide
24755,yes
24756,Civilization is a very fun game. In the beginning it seems too complex but as you start to play you realise very quickly that its actually not. Because Civilization has nice advisor system for beginners and they show you suggestions what you possibly could do. Also you cant miss anything because the game reminds you what you need to do before continuing to the next turn. Personally I never played any Civilization game before this and i am very happy with Civilization 5. Good Times.
24757,"Very good turn based strategy game. a bit of a ramp up to learn, but plenty of options to vary play once mastered. Still enjoyable after 700 hours."
24758,tis good game
24759,Love it
24760,"This game is complex, but once understood is a great deal of fun."
24761,This is fun for the family... Gandhi why...
24762,"I've enjoyed the game play as I play as a single player it it entertaining and keeps me guessing the best way to play the way I want to. Not driven in multiple direction by the game, meaning I play for domination of the game in as heavely a way that I can. yes my son tells me I should play the whole game for what it is, me Nah I just like it the way I play. So thanks developers for allowing me to play the way I like. 
Most games today I'd love to play but get killed every few minute, I'm older and challenged with the new controllers. If the newer games had God Mode like in the old days I'm sure I'd shell out plenty to purchase and play but till that happens I'm happy to play a game like this the way I like to play. Bring on the destruction.
-Gregg"
24763,"I think this game is better than Civ6, here are my opinions on it, good and bad, bad first since I said it was better than Civ6, 1. When you zoom in the graphics become horrible. 2. Very imbalanced things like long swordsman, they can survive hits from Atomic era planes, how does that work? 3. Nukes are really under underwhelming in power no matter if it is a ancient era wall city or a mega metropolis it only does half health damage. Now the good, decent graphics when zoomed out, the art style is better than Civ6 which is made to look after Civilization Revolutions, and it's no coincidence that both those games were both made to also go on phones and tablets to get to a younger audience, plenty of content ranging all eras, it really makes it that every game is unique if you want it to be, many civs for the base game, this is a nice change of pace compared to 6 for me, though 6 may have a close if not higher amount of civs, I feel like they just aren't as good or as worth it. The leaders are so much better, who cares about Catherine De Medici? I want to play as some one who actually did something in history like Napolean, there's good unit balance over all, even if I was complaining about the long swordsman the DLC I have makes the modern era far more interesting I'll give it that, and the modding community is just great."
24764,Good game.
24765,Very fun if you have time to lose.  If not I would not even start the game.
24766,Issa good game
24767,"It's been a decade,

24770,PLayed a bit. It's ok i guess
24771,"good, game, achievements a little specific."
24772,Quite simply the best Civilization game ever made. The only thing that could be improved is the multiplayer stability.
24773,Amazing Game! I forgot to give a review to this game years ago but it has been one of the best games I have ever played!
24774,"Truly recommend this game.
Even after 1200+ hours played i still enjoy playing this, even without mods.
"
24775,Best Civilization variant in my view.
24776,"Far better than the tedious Civ VI is, that's for sure, cities take up FAR less room, oh and the ocean units don't look like plastic bath tub toys either..."
24777,Yeah... Decent game... :D

24784,"I love this game so much. Even though it released nearly 10 years ago it is still worth the price, even more so if you can get it on sale."
24785,"'Civilization V' is one of those games that are good for if you have nothing else to do and you need to waste some time. If you like grand strategy games this is probably one of the best. If your more into action games and First-person shooters this probably isn't the game for you, the gameplay is fairly slow and sometimes tedious but the more you get into it the more the map becomes more enjoyable, you can also customise the game settings allowing you to change the map size, layout, how long each era will take, how you can win and how long the game will inevitably last.

My biggest problem with the game is that AI's are annoying to play with. They constantly ask for tributes and are not fun to go to war to as they really bad and don't do anything correctly. I did some research and there is a way of fixing this, I’ll leave a link below:

24788,fun to play with friends and family at partys
24789,"This is by far the best Sid of them all and I have played them all.  
Great game better than Sid 6 You cant go wrong with this game."
24790,"In my opinion still (even after Civ VI) the best turn based strategy game out there. There are several things you need to master: Expanding your cities (buildings and tiles to work on) to max population, science and production while also staying happy, your tech tree, your culture and social policies tree, expansion of your lands, diplomacy and prowess on the battlefield. That is quite a lot and timing of these so that they enhance each other marks good game play. Thoroughly enjoyable."
24791,"Fantastic strategy game, very in depth with options and choices to make. Very fun online game as well. Expect to lose hours to this game if you begin playing at any given time."
24792,"very addicting, a total classic"
24793,A great game! But play the tutorials it'll help a lot for understanding the game.
24794,"Time flies while playing this game. I mean, there must be some kind of magic in this game trapping me like crazy. Yeah, I mean the mods. Vanilla is itself amazing, but the mods extend the playable contents to another level."
24795,"It takes a long time to finish a game even on the quick settings but it is still a blast. There are so many civilizations to choose from with their own special bonuses. Due to this, the game never gets too stale. It also helps that it's hard to win a military victory early on due to the unhappiness debuff from taking other cities. This helps give all players a chance at victory. It's not like Endless Legend where one can just steam-roll all the other civs after destroying one. I would give this an 8/10."
24796,hooked
24797,Yes
24798,The Best!

24834,"I initially just got this game for the bit when it went on sale because I heard Ice T talk about it on the Gamergate episode of Law & Order: SVU. However, this ended up being a very lucrative investment. I have spent over 100 hours in this game and despite having firmly learned practically nothing about world history or actual kingmaking or statecraft, I have enjoyed myself immensely and do indeed understand why people raved about it so much in the first place."
24835,"A good game, although the graphics are a bit dated.  However, it does not have all the complexities of later versions which makes for a cleaner play."

24842,is fun
24843,"Real solid once you get all of the DLC's. It's very one dimensional before that.  Even post-DLC, the diplomatic victory is incredibly easy in single player.

I pretty much only play multiplayer, which I highly recommend.  The only gripes with it are a bug where it de-syncs after loading a save, forcing a player to leave the match for a turn, and leaving them to the mercy of the moronic AI. (Happens probably 10% of the time) There is also a ""feature"", that entirely freezes your screen when it isn't your turn, which makes actual turn-based multiplayer unbearable.  You can't plan turns, or even read through the in-game wiki (which is excellent btw).

I've heard the modding is pretty good, but haven't played it myself.  All in all, it's good."

24852,"Still the best Civ to date. Always having to choose a proposal at the world congress is pretty annoying, and diplomacy is very predictable after a while and never really goes your way. Other than that, this game is immensely fun."
24853,This game is fantasic and probably the most fun game in my library!!!!
24854,"Civ V is an engrossing game and moreover, it is a model of the human world that has lent flesh to my habit of speculating about the whys and hows of our problematic species.  Like any model it reflects its own premises and biases as much as the reality of human tribes, and that makes it all the more interesting.  The Civilization game concept is brilliant.  Civ V puts it on the ground with elegance and sophistication.
It must be said that the Civ V leaders are models of incivility:  No one ""accepts graciously"" who understands that grace obliges us to accept _gratefully_.  Language matters.  That, thankfully, is the game's greatest fault.  3382 game playing hours says Civ V is well worth your time."
24855,It good.
24856,"As a founding player of Sid Meier's Civ  game and playing for some 20+ years I think I have a bit of a idea of this game.... I still have my copies on floppy disk, CD & DVD. There have been a lot of changes to this game, some for the better and many for the determent to interactive game play, not to mention the fails on the bugs and crashes along the way.
But with all the hype and add ons aside I find this ( Civ V with personal settings ) to be the best format for me. It still has a few glitches which will obviously never be fixed, but after some 14369 hours played I think I have worked around most of them. 
I am 70 years of age and still conquer the world (On my computer at least). I average from 5,000 to 8,000 points a game and don't think too hard on the strategy and I rarely lose a unit in any game.
So my recommendations are chose this platform and game edition.
Maybe when they fix some of the more recent editions I will continue to try them again. But until that day (if ever), happy gaming.

Mods make this game even better, and allows you to customize your games to what you personally want.  My favorite Mod is the R.E.D. WW2 mod, which overhauls the game drastically in a way that is hard to explain unless you've played it; the best part is that the mod runs on the vanilla game."

24895,Very good.
24896,
24897,classic
24898,I can get really involved into the game.  This is a real great game
24899,A good game and probably my favourite civ game will go down as a very buggy classic
24900,All I can say is that this is addicting.  I feel like Civ 5 is more playable than Civ 6.
24901,100% Would recommend
24902,:^)
24903,ot cool
24904,great time waster
24905,Ill play this one until they create a modern Empire Earth.
24906,This game keeps me busy. I love the graphics that it has.
24907,Very recomended strategy-based videogame
24908,I like how the game flows with each turn the player make as the game progresses.
24909,hated these kind of games before i understood it now im addicted
24910,"great
"
24911,"Great. Depth of gameplay is ridiculous. Albeit strange not necessarily something I ever thought I was looking for, I never felt like I had learned so much about history whilst playing a game."
24912,Wonderful gameplay and graphics. Fully enjoy this game and would recommend it to anyone.
24913,The game is great way to spend your time.
24914,BELLO
24915,Really fun to play with a group of friends
24916,"I don't really have much negative things to say about the game. The only thing I can think of is multiplayer connectivity, but that might be an issue on our end of things. The game rarely crashes, I've only had it crash when I'm running like 7 different demanding mods. It's very immersive and so much to pay attention to, you can easily get lost in the game and be playing for hours on one session. I've always been a fan of Civilization, and from the reviews I've read from Civ 6, this game is still better than it's newer counterpart. I could waste about an hour listing all the pros of the game, I just recommend you get it and try it for yourself."
24917,You know what this is
24918,no 2 games are the same.  great variety.  lots of tricks you need to learn to beat the AI at the highest level.
24919,It real good
24920,One of very few 4x-Games where you can win without a war. <3
24921,"I have got my money's worth out of this game 1000 times over, have played it for years and still love it."
24922,"Great game, just one more turn."
24923,"Would you like to make a trade agreement with England?
Very addicting game"
24924,"I loved this game since i was a kid, phenomenal game <3"
24925,Smashing!
24926,10/10
24927,Uass
24928,"It's Civilization. Last time I played Civilization it was still Civilization 2, and not that much have changed. Perhaps it got easier, and there's more stuff to do and more ways to win. Still, I quite enjoyed my first playthrough and will probably play again."
24929,always a great game to play. have played many hours and plan to play more. highly recommend.
24930,"eh played it a bit and thought it was fun, maybe a bit late on the review but never late then never."
24931,"Best Civilization game ever. 6 is garbage, so garbage that they try to sabotage this game and its still active community."
24932,Best Civ game 2020

24956,"I have been playing Civilization since the games first started coming out. From Civ I - Civ IV... it's been a lot of fun developing - and I believe V and VI are about equal... in quality. They both have positives and negatives to them, and it depends what you want out of the game. I still play both."
24957,its pretty good
24958,Best Game 4ever
24959,Have palyed these games since Civ 2. My favourite games to play on a PC. Cant recommend it highly enough!!

25005,Just one turn
25006,"I love this game. I love the concept, the strategy, the fact there are multiple ways to win. You can be losing in the beginning and still win in the end. It's unpredictable. It takes many hours for a session of game play. When playing against computers, that's fine, I save and come back later. It's hard to set up a game with friends and actually finish a session, I have yet to do it. As a side note, this Civ. is probably the best one so far....and i'm not sure what happened when 6 was made.... But anyways, great game, love it a lot."
25007,f
25008,"best civ by far. tech, social policies and religion flow together very well. don't waste your money on civ 6"
25009,"nice strategic game, worth every penny"
25010,
25011,Having played nearly 500 hours of this game... let's just say I recommend it.
25012,Best Civ game to date. (Reviewed 2020-02-14)
25013,nice
25014,"Just bought this game. Played it while working. Didnt realize time is moving. 

Hours well wasted. Still new to this kind of game but this game sure is addictive.

Will waste more hours of my life <3"
25015,"Brave New World is a must, this game will destroy your life, and sap your free time.  11/10 would hermit again."

Very much success!"
25021,"The vibes are immaculate

25022,I've only played this game for 1113 hours....so maybe i like it a bit.
25023,"It's digital crack. Buyer beware, there is always time for one more turn."
25024,Epic
25025,Highly engaging simulation. Arguably the best game of the decade.

25047,An amazing game to play alone or with friends
25048,Its good
25049,"The gods & king version has great game play and endless different starting positions.  Each level of difficulty is also a different game requiring different strategy.  The artwork is better than the more recent version whose look is too juvenile for me to stomach.   Fair warning: don't start playing this game if you have a personality subject to addictions.   Also have a decent processor and video card, or later turns will slow down in a frustrating way.   I would pay to have the older version updated to just run faster."
25050,I like
25051,"das est gud
"
25052,A true classic in the Civilization line.
25053,very good
25054,Okey i guess
25055,Still feels better than civ 6 and still the most relaxing game I've played. My only negative comments are that the sequel was/is not good enough and that the games and expansions cost more than I'm willing to spend regularly.
25056,"The game is very good, the only problem is that the game often crashes randomly. For example, last time i was playing the game crashed when i met france. My last save was from almost 200 turns before. That's how i lost almost 4 hours because ofgame crashing."
25057,Very nice
25058,it is good. buy it
25059,"I've wasted countless hours on this game, and it still worth it."
25060,good game much strategy
25061,👍
25062,If you do not know what Civ is then no one can help you anyways.
25063,Civilization is a classic.  I personally liked this one wayyy more than Civ VI so I'm staying with this one until Civ VII comes out.
25064,i won'd
25065,"A run-of-the-mill Sid Meier Civ game.  Fun 4X, great time-killer."
25066,"Overall a great game, though there are background issues that should be fixed (LAN issues, among others)."
25067,"This is a game for a gamer who likes to think and plan, accepting the inevitable  AI results . Plus the bonus of seeing a city/empire you create and expand (or shrink?). Thoroughly rerccomended!"
25068,Spent to many hours on this game

25093,Nuking is fun
25094,good game
25095,It's alright.
25096,"A great game that wraps you up for hours at a time. You a constantly lost in this ""one more turn"" mentality as you try and see how things play out in the world. Great solo, great with friends, there is a reason this series is considered the pinnacle of turn-based 4X strategy games."
25097,"Hi lads, you are amazing!"
25098,Just having fun

25103,"Truly a member of the strategy pantheon, Civilization V is a must-play for any PC gamer, and still well worth picking up on sale."
25104,"An interesting concept

An interesting concept that permits one to try and build a civilization to beat all others. The higher difficulty levels are quite taxing. One down side, on the giant maps towards the end of the game, the time between turns can become excessive."
25105,it very gud
25106,"Civ is a very engaging game with lots of difficulty levels, changeable factors, and special scenarios. I love that it is so engaging and feels like no matter how well I know it, it will never get old."

25111,lets you live your wildest dreams of mass murder and control over the world. except i stayed up all night twice playing this so don't play it if you have a social life or obligations. you probably dont though because youre reading a game review you nerd.
25112,"Yo, check these hours. Tons of replayability and looks fantastic. Buy this shit."
25113,I am a quantification expert due to my autism and a hyper-fixation I have with some probability algorithms. This game is jammed with so many factors that you can never really figure out how to optimize play and get bored with it. It is a masterpiece of quality and originality.
25114,yes

25142,just a great well designed game with all the add ons
25143,hhh
25144,"This is my personal favorite of the series. I love almost everything about it from game mechanics to the toned down color palette and ""realistic"" graphics as compared to Civ6."
25145,
25146,"I love this game. After hundreds of hours of playtime, I continue to enjoy finding new ways to overcome however many empires I am competing with. I enjoy playing against the computer because it is easier to dominate, but multiplayer has the human element which can be far more competitive, and warlike. 
This game is exactly what I would want the board game, RISK, to be if it were massively overhauled into a video game; one that requires diplomacy, exploration, technology development, commerce, and more. The turn-based play makes this game feel like a board game, one you will be immersed in."
25147,Fun and addicting. Can lose yourself for hours in this game.
25148,Great game. No negatives.
25149,"almost the perfect game, hours of playing and still enjoyable"
25150,Similar to Age of Empires.
25151,"Iff you know the franchise, you'll love it. If you don't know the franchise, there's a very good reason that it has been the gold standard for turn based strategy games for decades."

gf and getting laid. If anyone wants to be my gf hmu and I'll try my best to be your daddy"
25162,Playing this game is a lot like what I imagine it would be to have a gambling addiction. You know that you should probably stop but you just can't walk away. Only I shouldn't bet everything on the ponies in this case because they are only an effective military unit early in the game.
25163,"'Can we have just a fun game where we don't rush nukes?'
'Yea sure'

A few rounds later

'Wait, I thought we said we weren't rushing nukes this time?'
And repeat."
25164,Pretty good game that is still fun even after playing it a lot
25165,Great Game
25166,One of the best games ever! Great strategy and great characters. A thoroughly flexible and awesome game :)
25167,great time killer on the road!
25168,10/10
25169,GDIUgyfqwed
25170,"Literally the most in depth strategy game to play with freinds. If you have freinds you will get into political battles of dick measureing contest before going to war. They will also constantly be discussing the best strategy before claiming the strategy you made was one they made. 10/10 would reccomend

If you play with randoms make sure you dont win too early or they will kick you. Most of the players that play this game online are terrible people that you should do nothing but seek to destroy them or else they will walk all over you building a city right next to your main. 2/10 wouldnt reccomend"
25171,naice
25172,It's nice man. Can take you a long time if you like strategy games.
25173,"I barley know how to play and it's pretty fun, and I've been playing for years."
25174,I dislike having to post a review before I can play again.
25175,"Love the turn based strategy, bought the expansion pack and I this only made the game better. I always seem to return to this game eventually."
25176,Very Nice.
25177,Hours of game play strategy and numerous ways to end it.
25178,"Great game, I have played most Civilization games and other various builders/RTGs and this one is 10/10"
25179,incredible game
25180,It is a great strategy and building game. still more fun than Civilization 6. I highly recommend it for this style of game
25181,"Love this game so much, played when it first came out. Forgot all about it for years, came back to it and it is still the same addicting game i remember."
25182,I mean it's just great.  It's like the mountain peak between the terrible Civ 4 and Civ 6
25183,the best of civ. ever
25184,love the game even though its a bit outdated its still so much fun to play.
25185,"Civ 5 is way better than civ 6, in my opinion.  At least you can build an empire without worrying about being invaded by religious zelots and the settler mode is way easier than in civ 6 too."

25208,"im pretty sure 60 out of these 101 hours were from one session
10/10 would nolife again"
25209,"The best-balanced, most feature-rich, most well-rounded game in the Civ franchise in my opinion. The extensibility via mods is off the charts, both in terms of modding gameplay systems and adding new civilizations. If you don't like something, there's almost certainly a mod to change it by this point.

It's perfect to combine with watching Youtube videos as a laid-back fun activity, or to focus on by itself on harder modes or against friends. I've tried Civ VI on multiple occasions but I've never been able to make the switch because of the clunky cartoony style, slower gameplay (especially as the game drags on), and what I felt was an emphasis on warfare over other victory methods. I keep returning to this oldie but goodie instead!"

25238,"If you haven't bought this game yet, you need to. Anything you don't like about the game can now be fixed with mods. This is my favorite game of all time."
25239,"Civilization V is perhaps the best in the entire series,  so much could be said for the replayability but there is issues though such as the bad warmonger system and poor diplomacy but in all honesty, diplomacy has been an issue in the Civ games since the original. 

The irony is that Civilization V is far better than VI - and I would recommend this version over VI easily."
25240,Needs android/Chrome app version.
25241,"good game, best in gener"
25242,"As all CIV Games, this is very very addicting and time consuming. 

Forever one of my all time favorites, although not as good as Civ 3, this game is amazing and totally worth it. 

Tip for those on Macbooks, im able to run this on a Mid 2012 Macbook with 8gb RAM on Catalina."

25252,Fantastic game! Can't stop playing

25254,"Outstanding game, especially the world builder. Highly recommend if you like turn based strategy games!"
25255,fuh
25256,Siam built my great library and i was pissed off. Nevertheless its aight.
25257,"when to hold back, when to advance; be careful, but aggressive...lessons for life/work as you entertain yourself"
25258,good
25259,I have been playing since it first came out. Still think its the best CIV out today. Great way to exercise your mind in strategy and pass time.
25260,"Its awesome as heck just do it 
"
25261,Venice beats Poland like rock beats scissors
25262,"is good
"
25263,"Without a doubt, this game is one of the best I have played. Single-player and multi-player games are both very engaging and can keep you invested in a single match for countless hours at a time.

If you are going to buy it, make sure to buy all the DLC, as each one significantly improves the game mechanics (and your friends will greatly appreciate it)."
25264,Sugoi
25265,great game
25266,jesus christ don't play this game if you value your life
25267,ordsaopfpopo
25268,"Dont buy, fails to load: rubbish"
25269,One of the best games ever made.
25270,good
25271,GREAT GAME
25272,Great game. Easily able to get your money's worth
25273,i like to play and eat my dominos with my cat buddy. hes agood boy
25274,Fun for the Family until someone builds The Great Library
25275,yes
25276,i havnt played this game in like 4 years ago but it probably gud
25277,cock and ball
25278,Like it better than civ 6
25279,"One of the classics, I never tire playing this game."
25280,"nice
"
25281,"Pretty dope
"
25282,Omg so much fun and doesn't require the best computer in the world to play 5-stars get this game
25283,good remember to make a trade agreement with england to win the game tho
25284,"Good, just like every other Civ. If you like them before you will like this. better than Civ 4, not as good as Civ 6."
25285,when you have over 1000 hours played.....its finely time to stop being lazy and give it a thumb up : )
25286,fantastic game. this is the closest i will ever be to running a country.
25287,nice
25288,"Civ V is a classic turn based strategy game, and that's why I love it."
25289,should give dlc for free now
25290,it's pretty good
25291,"I had a 2000 year war with France over them stealing one of my settlers.. A couple well placed nukes did the trick! I've nuked my own city so it couldn't fall into enemy hands, conquered Spain as the Aztecs.. There's unlimited possibilities in Civ 5, I got it for $40 but I'd easily say the game is well worth $60. Among one of my favorite games of all time!!!"
25292,This game is amazing! If you are even thinking of it.... Do not hesitate. Buy NOW.
25293,Gud.
25294,I think this is one of the best civ games and it gets even better with playing with friends you have to buy the DLC if you want the most fun out of it though just a heads up
25295,BIG OL poo poo
25296,I love this game and each play through was its own story.  I never feel like I wasted time when I lose. I wish there were more ways to win and more civilizations to play but this is by far the best game in the series.
25297,"I used to play Civ 5 with all of my friends all the time while we are away at school. However, they recently updated the game, causing me to be unable to play with them, all since I purchased  a Mac instead of a Windows Machine! After paying $60 for a multiplayer game specifically geared towards online gameplay, it's enraging that they would do this. I can never play this game with my friends again."
25298,Great Game. Worth the buy.
25299,better than civ VI
25300,"very cool game, only with mods"
25301,modern age of empires but better 11/10
25302,I got nuked by Gandhi. 10/10
25303,"Very good game, the game becomes a bit of the same after some time. But is really fun to play multiplayer, and super chill"
25304,"More complicated than Civ 4, some introductions I did not like. But, overall a great civ game.."
25305,"good game, never played by myself. But got help from mastermind so it was fun. Ended up winning"
25306,This game is good as hell. I always do Jihad Time.
25307,very epic game

25312,been playing this game since 2011 still the best game ever i have played
25313,great
25314,Absorbing and challenging and quite adictive.
25315,excellent game. Been playing 10 years already
25316,Great game.
25317,a mighty fine addition to the series
25318,in my limited experience...best ever.
25319,"My first civ experience, have never played a game so much in the span of two weeks ever. A masterpiece."
25320,10/10
25321,Juste awesome
25322,Great game. Played it most before i got it again on steam
25323,yes very good
25324,great game .  better  than civ 6
25325,this is a great game recommend it if you like strategy games
25326,Awesome
25327,Really awesome game! Additive!
25328,good game don't do it
25329,its a good game if you have the time to play and its great for party games
25330,"It's CIV, basic turn based game

factions could be improved and differentiated, but then it would be Endless Legend"
25331,it makes my wang  rock solid.
25332,Not Bad
25333,It's pretty decent
25334,so good. so much brain power in use. good work. love the realistic graphiks
25335,it is good
25336,"Suleiman is best boy, don't @ me"
25337,great game
25338,its good
25339,*Pigeoning Intensifies*
25340,fun
25341,"This game is fairly easy to learn, and new ideas on how to handle building and trying to  win come along.  So  it  challenges me to  learn new tricks against opponents.   Only ever won  twice on hardest level, but, such is life.  On a dull day, i get to keep the brain in gear.  So play  it  and see what you  think."
25342,Civ 5
25343,It's alright
25344,feels better than Civ 6
25345,fun
25346,They disabled cross-play with mac and now this game is garbage. Everyone stay far away from buying this. Absolute trash developers who don't care about their fan-base.
25347,good game
25348,Best in the franchise
25349,"Pretty fun game by Simp Meier. Sometimes the AI CIVs are extremely passive, but in a turns time become more aggressive than a pitbull with a 4 year old. Highly recommend playing with friends and collaborating against the AI civilizations, your mutual hate of barbarians and enemy AI CIVs district you from the fact there can only be one winner."
25350,Maybe i haven't gotten to the good part yet
25351,"cult
yes
get it"
25352,I can't play online with my friends who have a mac now. Apparently it was a new update or something that removed cross platform playablility. Now this game is worthless to me.
25353,my life has disappeared before my very eyes...
25354,A classic with a modern taste strategy kind of game. very fun
25355,it game has play for game wait turn good boom with nuke. yes?
25356,If you have all DLC's it's better than Civ VI
25357,Favorite game
25358,it is good
25359,Do you want to not feel guilty for playing video games? This is the answer. Hands down the most educational and at the same time fun game I've ever played.
25360,pwn.
25361,It's good.
25362,"Challenging strategy game.  It sometimes crashes, and the economics of the game is irritating when it seems like there is nothing you can do to avoid losing gold.  However, even with these weaknesses it is my favorite computer game of all time."
25363,Still learning the basics but it seems to have some level of replayability
25364,the only game that ever made me hard while i killed off another player
25365,!
25366,Ye buy
25367,meh. it's okay.
25368,it so good
25369,"nice!!!
"
25370,"This game would be definitely attractive to you if you are keen on governing, developing a country, and competing with others."
25371,Sid Meier's Civilization V remains the top of the line for Civs. The relative simplicity is everything
25372,IT GOOD
25373,Worth it and holds up against future generations of the franchise.
25374,Awesome
25375,good
25376,"I don't know exactly what it is about this version, but the game seems to almost auto-play in some ways. Combined with no real effort made to help you visualize your holdings, and it makes for a lackluster gaming experience. I find little to no sense of wonder in the exploration, and no real sense that any decisions I make in the strategic game make a difference. 
The research tree seems near pointless, as I don't see much of a reason to do anything but research what will be finished the soonest, ninety percent of the time. In the end, you have them all anyway, no decision has any real impact on what you will look like at the end.
Just a big blah from me. 
"
25377,"This game is very fun until the Netherlands nukes you [u]several times[/u]. Played a bit so far, looking forward to playing more"
25378,"A great game, very addictive. I have been playing it since the first edition came out on Amega 500 in the early 90s"
25379,i have 999+ hours invested into this. I love this game (:
25380,cool
25381,Iconic
25382,"GG
"
25383,Great game!
25384,best civ game of all
25385,"Great strategy game that keeps me engaged for hours.  You get to mess around with history and geography a bit, which is always fun."
25386,Great game... can relax or challenge you depending on the level of play selected.
25387,It's okay
25388,Great time waster. Good replay value. Excellent game for single player or multiplayer. what more do you need to ask??? Just one more turn....
25389,nice
25390,Maybe the best Civ game? I love it.
25391,"Great game, isn't much else like it out there right now."
25392,"Its classsssssssssssssssss
"
25393,"""just one more turn"" has ruined many mornings from staying up too late playing this game. Definitely recommend!"
25394,my fat c%*k
25395,"I love this game! I can spend a whole day just playing it. It has so much to offer: different victory types, deep strategy, nice music and every single campaign is different! I recommend buying this on sale with all it's DLC's to get the full experience. Overall one of my favorite games and for good reason."
25396,I keep coming back to it. the civilization games have replay value and theyre good for multiple people.
25397,very good
25398,worth the time
25399,Addictive.
25400,an improvment over earlier versions graphics with new races and ways to play the game you know... i fell in love with Civ all over again.
25401,great game
25402,"Honestly, The Best Game Ever Made."
25403,yes
25404,very good for stradagy  games
25405,fun
25406,YERS
25407,Recommend playing with a friend or more. also runs good on my laptop
25408,nice game
25409,This game is supa cool
25410,"I recommend if you need a game to sink ""a few"" hours into... just a few"
25411,Better then 6
25412,"I am bad at this game. It does nothing but take up my time and spawn me next to Genghis Khan. I tried at first to play it like a city builder and if i can give any advice, don't do that. Overall 8/10."
25413,gg
25414,"Absolutely amazing game, can make the time just fly by as you get absorbed into this game."
25415,great
25416,It is really fun. I like it
25417,"So far, I've put over 1,500 hours into this game. It's alright."
25418,really fun
25419,"In my opinion, the BEST Civilization Game."
25420,Lovely little game. I would honestly buy this game 5 times before playing it because sometimes you need 5x the troops.
25421,I liked this game. It was fun.
25422,yes
25423,"In my ongoing and likely futile effort to write a Steam review for every game in my library (#138 out of 555)... it's time for Civilization V.

Hands-down the best iteration of the Civilization series, even considering subsequent titles like Beyond Earth and Civilization VI. This is Sid Meier's Civilization at its very best, especially with the DLC, even if none of the expansions are are radical or imaginative as Civilization IV's."
25424,"Fantastic game, really enjoyable game-play loop with a modest amount of complexity that keeps everything fresh. There is a good amount of factions to play as and you can change things up by selecting different maps. Brave New World is a must buy, tourism and other additions make it a little but more of a deeper experience."
25425,"great love it
"
25426,I love this game. I have invested a ton of hours in it. 5/5
25427,"My EGM review from 2011:

Thank god i bought the game on whim last sunday! And i'm also pretty happy i found the 50 hours to finish a game on a huge map and on an epic timescale. I've never had so much fun ruling an empire. This is it for 2011 and the years to come!
I've only ever played single player games in all Civs, and i'm not the kind of player to play game after game after game. I'd rather return once or twice a year for a game, mostly because it's just impossible to stop playing. The exact same happened now. My neck hurts, and my eyes can't focus beyond 2 feet. But i'm satisified with the experience!

I've played as Japan, and slowly settled and conquered my way through the whole south east of Asia. Until all space was taken by one of the other civilizations. Borders are now more or less permanent, and not constant in motion like in Civ 4, which makes it easier to guard and plan the guarding of your empire. It feels really cool to have your strong units defending the passages through the mountains that border your territory. And have your battleships guard your sea space. Have your sealed off super empire.

Combat has evolved! The whole one unit per tile is great! Units are no longer expendable but can evolve and level, and if used wisely, can last forever. On prince difficulty the AI wasn't intimidating, maybe a little dumb sometimes. But it didn't feel too dumb. Because i was caught in the illusion of my empire. Bombers destroying incoming Persian units. My ships and missiles pounding on border cities. The cities constantly thinking about what to produces, afraid that a giant force will come from the fog of war.

All this violence is balanced by the happiness of your people, which gets lower if you expand too fast. So there's no way to just roll over your enemies. Every step has to be taken intelligently with consideration of every aspect. Like, what resources will the city i conquer have? Will they make my people happier so i can steam on to the next city? Or will succes in battle mean sad citizens and production cuts in all my empire?

There's a lot of ways to go about victory, basically generate culture and civics (religion and state forms and benefits), generate science and launch a space ship, conquer all, or get voted winner by the U.N. I build a rocket!

There's just so much to say about this game. It allready feels balanced. Maybe because i played it right after a mayor patch? I've had so many little predicaments, victories, and so much fun. I could go on forever. But really, if you like Civilization: it just got a while lot prettier, and just as engaging, addicting and fun as ever. Watch out for your dayjob! Get a good video card! And play the game!
 
Edit after replay 2012: i'm starting to miss the religions. But i hear they're comming in an expansion. Also did my first hotseat game ever: good that that feature got added. But it was a ridiculously inequal game. I had a whole continent to myself, and my opponent was struggeling in a wartorn region. Too easy win for me.

Still, we had fun for a whole week...!

10/10 a masterwork!"
25428,Hours of fun building alliances with your fellow rulers and despots to survive against the barbarian hordes and then plotting their ultimate subjugation and destruction!
25429,"Play as Poland
Realize Germany is  your neighbor
Realize Russia is another neighbor
Get nervous
Befriend them
Kill them with giant death robots
Poland gets Revenge"
25430,Its a ruddy good game
25431,nice
25432,"I would always scroll straight past and CIV games in the store, but after getting it in the January sales i fell in love with it and would highly recommend this game to anyone and everyone!"
25433,Best version imo
25434,this is my fav game. sine civ 3.
25435,"Even after 300+ hours, I still get the itch to play this game more.  Great replay value and one of my favorite games of all time.   Somewhat steep learning curve but boy is it worth it.  Just one more turn!"
25436,"Not worth it without the expansions, and very much worth it with...."
25437,You can spend sooooo many hours
25438,good
25439,love
25440,nice
25441,"After so many years, still worth playing. I still prefer playing Civ 4 but this game still makes Civ worth spending time with."
25442,it's allright
25443,"Civ 1 and 2 player, back for this one. Yep, addictive as always."
25444,"VERY GOOD DETAILS ABOUT ALL HUMAN CIVILIZATIONS, YOU WILL LEARN SO MUCH WHEN YOU ARE ADDICTED TO IT"
25445,This game is everything!!
25446,"Addict game, highly recommend"
25447,Good game for killing all your nerves tryin' to win on deitry dificulty
25448,"Fantastic addition to the series. If you enjoy Civ games, buy this one."
25449,It is one of the few Sid Meier's games that I can say without doubt captures the nature of civilization. it has greatly improved over its predesesor and still remains the best in the series to date. Also its cheap if you wait for a sale.
25450,Favorite of the series
25451,I some how started a war with everyone without noticing. fun game
25452,"It's a good civ game, this is a hexmap game so if you prefer square boards I would recommend Civ3."
25453,"Sid Meiers 5, get the 3 or 4 instead. This version is good, I guess updated graphics and tons of dlcs that you need to buy in order to get the full expierience that the others offer for nothing(price)."
25454,h
25455,"much fun, buy Company of Heroes 2 instead!"
25456,good
25457,great game for people who just enjoy playing a great strategy game i always come back to play as this is a classic for me from my childhood
25458,nut
25459,"Played on many accounts, this game is fantastic. Better than the sequel!"
25460,neat
25461,its really awesome
25462,if crack was a game
25463,Excellent game .. ..
25464,There is a civilization. It is 5.
25465,"The game is great. It was a ton of ability to be replayed over and over with different leaders, map sizes, difficulty as well as different paths to victory. If you are looking into this game you likely don't need this review and already know it is amazing."
25466,Is very nice
25467,i played it a little bit. it's a pretty good game
25468,"I've been playing this game for years, sometimes at a time. Easily one of the mos thoroughly thought out and replayable game money can buy. I would thoroughly recommend this game to anyone who is a fan of complex board games, maps, and chess. If I were stranded on a desert island and I had this game I would be okay."
25469,Great Game
25470,yes
25471,The best Civ of them all.
25472,"Its just simply a amazing tragedy game,even though its a little bit old i still believe its a great game but lately its been crashing over and over again making it hard to play."
25473,Good Time Killer And Fun To Compete
25474,One of my all time favorite games in history.
25475,Love it
25476,very good
25477,Still the best civilisation forever! And the graphics is not this bad. Forget CIV 6!
25478,Addicting
25479,yes
25480,Great upgrade. I like the hexagonal setup.
25481,This game is highly adctive and awsome
25482,Nice game
25483,good
25484,"Time gets lost as I play this game, and I come back to it even with Civ VI out"
25485,yea
25486,"While the initial release of this game was highly lacking, the final version with all expansion packs is one of the best turn-based strategy games of all time and I've sunk more time into it than any other game of it's genre, especially playing as some of the odder Civs in the game. Up to you if the start-up cost is worth it but I think this is the safe bet until we get to the end of Civ6's lifecycle."
25487,"I was enjoying this game until I started encountering a glitch. This glitch prevents your workers from upgrading tiles, making it near-impossible to build farms, quarries, roads etc properly. I was attempting a domination victory which meant that I had to rapidly expand my civilisation as I annexed new territories. My civilisation was also low on cash after conquering a neighbouring one, so I needed to upgrade those tiles quickly to create new sources of income. Without being able to upgrade anything, my civ would have been broke in less than 10 turns and forced to sell off military units. Basically the game put me in a no-win situation (in the context of a domination victory), and I completely lost interest in the game after that (it was the 2nd or 3rd campaign where I had encountered said glitch).

Anyway, Steam will not give me a refund for this game so I am writing this review for two reasons. The first is that, hopefully, the devs see this review and patch the game (though I doubt they will since Civ 6 is their main focus now). If they don't patch the game, then the second reason for this review is to warn other players about what happened.

This game is like most Firaxis games that I've played- the core game is brilliant and fun to play, but once you're hooked the game will start throwing strange glitches at you. And some of those glitches, despite seeming small, are capable of breaking the game and ruining the entire experience for the player. I'm very disappointed in this game and pretty disappointed that this keeps happening with Firaxis games in general."
25488,Very Nice
25489,pretty good
25490,"The developers don't care about this game anymore. It crashes constantly and is a bloody mess on Windows 10. If you wanted to play it, you've missed the boat."
25491,good game
25492,Nice!
25493,help. Each game I try to get better. I am min/max-ing my life away.
25494,fun
25495,Addictive time sink with lots of value. There is an unbelievable amount of complex detail in the mechanics of the game. It is seemingly endless with the world conquering  fantasies you can play around with.
25496,Just look at my hours played. Huge depth of strategy and many legit paths to victory. Really fun mechanics. Tons of mods to make it even more varied and tailored.
25497,i simply dont see the appeal
25498,I guess it's OK and has OK replayability. I guess
25499,"dardy game, lots of bomb"
25500,its okay
25501,"Absolute best version of Civilization, with ground-breaking improvements upon Civ4. Supported by a dedicated modding community; play Vox Populi and and any modmods that catch your fancy (use MPMPM for multiplayer) and don't look back at Civ6.

Oh, and use ""ineedlegacyaccess"" to get rid of the terrible new adware launcher."
25502,It is civilized and I idolize Sid Meier. Give me V while I play just one more turn.
25503,"I love this game, but you really need all the major DLC to play it in its best form. I didn't like the game at first after playing Civ IV for so long, but it grew on me. Fun to play alone or with friends, but after a while you realize what the optimal path is. This game can create funny situations you will think back on for a long time."
25504,nothing comppared to pirates or risk
25505,I'm not a huge fan of strategy games and I adore Civ V.
25506,a classic
25507,Good to play alone and chip away at in your free time. Better with friends. Best with all the DLC. One of my personal favorites
25508,If you ever need to kill time play this game. I once had to wait before leaving for school and when i was done playing my entire class had graduated.
25509,I like it.
25510,"Quite the addictive game. I've over 100 hours now and I'm still garbage, so there's plenty more hours to be had so I can be less bad

Edit: After 121 hours I have finally won a game. I am now less bad."
25511,"Simply still the best game in turn-based world domination out there. 
Could write hours about what this games makes right but cut that - just buy it if you like these kind of games.
It's great."
25512,woot woot
25513,ya it's pretty good
25514,"I spent so much of my life playing this game. Notice how I didn't say ""wasted""."
25515,Great game. Get ready to lose your sense of time.
25516,"This game is incredible it has many flaws yes but most of them are minor the only truly  major flaws in the game i will say is being hardcore forced into going rationalism for policy as you will always be far behind any human who adopted it if you ignore it, against ai though it matters not you can win with anything,
despite this however, the game is still i would say one of the best strategy games of all time.
"
25517,"What can I say about this game that hasn't been said already? Civilization is as fun as ever.  Highest replay value of any game of ever owned.  The scenarios are super fun, the gameplay is awesome, the DLC is incredible.  This has been my favorite game since Civ 3."

25528,A classic
25529,"I find this a wonderful game with many complexities and intricacies .. I have been playing Civ since Civ-2 was released many years ago -- liked it then, and still like it now .. :-) .. It has certainly grown and evolved over the years .. 
One of the main things I like about it is that it is a slower paced, turns-based game which does not continue playing itself when you're away from the computer .. You leave in the middle of a turn to do something, and nothing has changed, nobody has attacked you, the world effectively freezes .."
25530,yo dis game rocked my his hous so hard that i had too go back to school and learn about the civz so i could beat them
25531,"Great game, it stole hours of my life!"
25532,My first game i put 35 hours in and it was the most enjoyable turn based time I've ever had!
25533,Just... one... more... turn...
25534,"Great Game to get lost in . When you just want to shut off , get in the zone and game this is for you , highly recommend"
25535,Rather different from Civ 4 or Civ 6. It's unique in all the right ways.
25536,this is the best game in the series
25537,Still love it after all these years...

25577,o
25578,Good with DLCs. wouldnt recommend playing without them. it really adds an element to the game that provides different challenges to each character played and will take hundreds of hours to master one character.
25579,Just one more turn
25580,Good game
25581,Really good strategic game
25582,Civ 5 is truly one the best tbs out there for country mangement and other things. This game may not have all the fancy stuff from civ 6 but this one just looks better and feels better and doesn't get your nerves about tedious things like housing as the main example plus the mod support for this game is amazing just due to the amount mods for this game almost make it the skyrim of tbs games. But in all honesty I would rate civ 5 a 9/10 as I believe no game is perfect as there is something that could be improved
25583,ITS GLORIOUS NO MOAR QUESTIONS PLZ
25584,"did you know that mountain lions are more like house cats, in that they dont roar, they purr, and meow."
25585,.
25586,Fun game. Loads slow.
25587,"I've known Civilization since Civ II but truly started playing this series a few years ago with Civ III when Civ III, Civ IV and Civ V were on special in a bundle. I enjoyed Civ III, disliked the IV and loved Civ V. Civ VI with it's Gathering Storm DLC has been out for a while now, but nonetheless still find myself going back to Civ V once in a while. It's that good! Definitely recommend."
25588,Truly better than Civ6
25589,xc
25590,"A great entry in the Sid Mier's collection. It is an amazingly open game, with different play styles and opportunities. In the first 50 hours or so, this game is gonna confuse the shit outa you. You'll enjoy it but, you won't know what the fuck you're doing. Then after that it is all fun and breezing, tryna conquer difficulty levels or just tryna win with different playstyles. Mods increase the fun by 100% but not all mods are compatible/ good for your game. Enjoy the wonder that is Civ V and i'll see you when HumanKind comes out"
25591,"Great game, but the load time when you first start the game and the time it takes between turns is soul destroying."
25592,"Really amazing game! I played quite a lot of singleplayer (wich is really fun already), but there's also multiplayer. I recommend playing this mode with friends because there aren't that many people who make open servers for anyone to join. Personally I don't play the harder difficulties seeing as I'm not that good. :P
I gotta say that it does get a little repetitive after a while, so taking a break from the game sometimes is recommended! But overall really good game!"
25593,e
25594,Great game for those who are new to the world of civilization.
25595,Aye!
25596,yup
25597,Best game ever!!!

25603,yes

Careful, if you're prone to addictions, this game is going to get you sent to rehab. Jussayin'."
25605,"...
"
25606,It's good
25607,"The game concept original and  great.  BUT, this game is very buggy.  Put your workers on a task and you have to keep assigning the task until it's finished. ( they are supposed to stay on in until completion unless reassigned) Also, if you chose a unit promotion from the unit (instead of the notification that comes down the right side of the screen, the game tells you the unit needs a promotion on the right side of the screen AFTER EVERY TURN until the game is over)  The are several other bugs too.  BUT THE BIG ISSUE IS the the game developer apparently has no interest in fixing the bugs.  (no fixed for years now)  So to summarize, it's a great game concept.  But don't DON'T GET IT UNLESS YOUR WILLING TO PAY MONEY TO A COMPANY WHO DOESN'T CARE ABOUT YOUR GAMING SATISFACTION AFTER THEY RECEIVE YOUR MONEY."
25608,good
25609,It's got longevity.
25610,Still way better than Civ 6.
25611,"I got addicted after turn 355 and haven't stopped playing yet. Graphics are good for an older game. The DLC's... Keep 'em coming. And the year is 2020. Mods are good. There are some many different variables on game play, it could take an entire life time to play each combo with the DLC's. Cons; Online peeps can be a bit prissy, easily triggered, and emotionally unstable. It can take forever for an online game to start. In my opinion, still better than Civ VI."
25612,I live civ5. I like that it's on steam. I despise that it harasses me to make comments. Leave me alone.
25613,good time sink
25614,The game is great.

25635,I've played this (according to civ) for 111 hours. I would't waste 111 hours of my life unless it was a good game. I recommend it.

25637,its good
25638,"Great Game lots of Action, really makes you think about what to do next
i played with NO MODS an all in all a good time, of course once you get to Immortal Level 7 you have to deal with the others gaining Massive Bonus's to resources, popularity and such.but with the right mind set can be Beat
will try to beat Level 8 Deity, could be a challenge ;-)"

25655,The best way to support the coronavirus fight is to play civ 5 at home
25656,"First things first, the ingame graphics are great, the perfomance too. The menu doesn't adapt to the graphic settings though, which will get really annoying the longer you play it. The multiplayer is also quite buggy when you pause it and continue playing a day later. The AI will get 2 turns without you being able to to anything, it will autoskip you. Also, you're automatically assigned a unit to command at the start of every round and if you click on a city, you're unable to research, command units or change researches and so on. You need to press escape twice to continue your round. The difficulties reach from free win, to pretty much autolose. The only thing, that really bummed me out, was the fact, that pumping everything into religion wasn't really a viable tactic to win. Plus probably half the units are really viable. Most of the others are just a waste of turns. 7/10"
25657,a very good time killer
25658,great game its fun
25659,"No one:
Not a soul:
America denouncements:
What the fuck did you just fucking say about me, you little bitch? I'll have you know I graduated top of my class in the Navy Seals, and I've been involved in numerous secret raids on Al-Quaeda, and I have over 300 confirmed kills. I am trained in gorilla warfare and I'm the top sniper in the entire US armed forces. You are nothing to me but just another target. I will wipe you the fuck out with precision the likes of which has never been seen before on this Earth, mark my fucking words. You think you can get away with saying that shit to me over the Internet? Think again, fucker. As we speak I am contacting my secret network of spies across the USA and your IP is being traced right now so you better prepare for the storm, maggot. The storm that wipes out the pathetic little thing you call your life. You're fucking dead, kid. I can be anywhere, anytime, and I can kill you in over seven hundred ways, and that's just with my bare hands. Not only am I extensively trained in unarmed combat, but I have access to the entire arsenal of the United States Marine Corps and I will use it to its full extent to wipe your miserable ass off the face of the continent, you little shit. If only you could have known what unholy retribution your little ""clever"" comment was about to bring down upon you, maybe you would have held your fucking tongue. But you couldn't, you didn't, and now you're paying the price, you goddamn idiot. I will shit fury all over you and you will drown in it. You're fucking dead, kiddo."

25661,Play as China. Name capital 'Wuhan'. Create religion called 'Corona'. Spread 'Corona' to other civilizations. Win game.
25662,"buy it, it's pretty good"
25663,"Besides having to buy the DLC just to fix bugs, the custom map editor doesn't work. After all these years they still don't even have a basic functioning game. Civ 2 was better than this."
25664,SICK
25665,Awesome
25666,"Civilization is a fun, addictive turn based experience. You can go through multiple routes for victory but the most common is domination. It is easy to lose track of time and burn hours on this game!"
25667,the most addictive game you will ever play.
25668,Cool
25669,"Its fun once you learn how to play and strategies, but it dose have a huge learning curve i'm still learning, with the DLC it adds a new mechanic that you never thought would impact the game, I would recommend this for people who love turn based games and strategy games and if you like trying to take over the world."
25670,i have played 2090 hours i wouldnt have if this game was bad . it is a work of art and a masterpiece you should buy this game 100%
25671,incredible game would recommend
25672,This game is great to pass the time. I've enjoyed countless hours in the game and it never get old. 3 hours go by very quickly when playing this game. 10/10 would recommend.
25673,"get good
"
25674,This is the game i play when i want to have control over everything.
25675,"After spending over a thousand hours in this game, I have come to the conclusion that I like this game.  Will you like this game? That all depends on you. If you like games where you start out with very little and build up into something amazing, you will probably like Civilization."
25676,great
25677,Great strategy game!!!
25678,A LOT BETTER THAN VI
25679,"I have enjoyed the customization capabilities, trying different scenarios, add ons and logic"
25680,I used to think this game was so complicated and never liked the earlier ones. Then one day I decided to give it a go and after playing through all the tutorials I am hooked! Being a history buff ive never had so much fun with a game. 10/10!
25681,Will ruin your life. Don't.
25682,"Amazing game, especially if you buy the DLC. It is better (and cheaper) then civ VI imo. Looks complicated but is a lot more simple then it seems."
25683,love ducking neel
25684,I like the game! very interesting and low skill floor/high skill ceiling.
25685,just good with bugs
25686,This is a great game . So many permutations.  Have not seen any duplications of scenarios after playing hundre ds of games . So challenging. Love it.
25687,ooooooooooooooooo yeaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa bb
25688,its a gud game
25689,"10/10 would nuke Sydney as Ramses the II, establish a alliance with Russia and decline trade requests with England again"
25690,"Absolutely captivating. Beautiful gameplay, and a million ways to play."
25691,"Yes very good
"
25692,"Still a fun game, that you can lose hours playing.  Great for anyone that loves strategy games."
25693,"Great game, allows for infinite hours of fun. Like this version better than any of the others."
25694,"With 376 hours right now, I can say I fully recommend this game with at least the Brave New World DLC, which did add some missing aspects from the last came like tourism, religion, and spies.  Civ IV used to be my favorite, but after I bought the DLC, I found it real tough to even go back.  

Even compared with Civ VI, I would say this game is superior, sadly.  Now, I never bought any Civ VI DLC, so I will note that.  But even so, just the gameplay seems much more stable in Civ V.  I actually like the graphics better in V as well, although I can get over that.  But the new aspects that Civ VI added fell flat on it's face for me.  Seemed like Civ VI was trying to emulate the more complex Endless series, but just didn't do it well.  So, for me Civ V hit the juicy middle ground between Civ IV and Endless Legends.

Overall, it's just a simple game of chess that I can turn on, play for 10 minutes, leave, come back, or just turn it back on weeks later without being too lost.  With the random terrain, decent amount of Civilizations, and other small changes, I have found enough variety to keep me entertained for the 400 hours I will certainly log with this game.  So if you're fairly new to 4X strategy games, I feel like Civ V is a perfect pick.  Simple and fun.  Endless Legends offers a bit more complexity, but it can be a little overwhelming if you're not versed in these games."
25695,Great game
25696,it is very fun and its base game is better than civ 6's base game
25697,"awesome
"
25698,Very engaging even after so many years
25699,In this game I play as an English Woman who loves to roam the sea and shoot the barbs with my big ship cannon babyyyyyyyyyy
25700,"Not really a Game, more like a time machine till morning"
25701,it plays well and i like how easy it is to mod the game to play how i want to. I am an explorer so fewer civilizations suits me best.
25702,One of the best games created by humanity.
25703,it is fun
25704,pretty good
25705,amazinggggggg
25706,very good
25707,"Very pretty graphics, and thankfully, runs well on any current system...this iteration of a classic Microprose Game, lets you, the player, choose the direction of one of many different nations from history, and you mold them into your ultimate culture and process. Good to play with friends, but it will take a while to do so....excellent system with all the DLC's combining to make the perfect strategy game."
25708,I have played this game since the very first Civ came out. It never gets old. Now I have the challenge of learning CivVI  :)
25709,"Man, I remember reading about how Ramses and Elizabeth the 1st worked together to create guns in the 1200 in my history books..."
25710,Civ 5 is cool
25711,Quite possibly the peak of the civilization series.
25712,"Have always loved Civ, and Civ 5 is the best one so far want to take over the world go for it. Would you like to go to space well you can. Would you like to be able to nuke anyone even your own friends have fun."
25713,It's a great game!
25714,"I won't lie, I wouldn't have gotten this games full DLC when it was sixty dollars without having played it. Luckily Steam gives sales for breathing, so you can get the Brave New World Expansion for $12 which is a steal. I love this game. If ever a game was needed to spend countless (actually 658) hours on, its this game. It's good as the basic game. It's fantastic as the full DLC. Worth every penny"
25715,fun
25716,dope
25717,so awesome to play with friends.
25718,good game
25719,"Don't know what I'm doing, still fun."

25737,its neat
25738,better graphics than civ 6
25739,possibly the best Civilization game i have played
25740,"micromanagement can get annoying, but otherwise a very fun game."
25741,Amazing game
25742,good
25743,Best Turn Based game on the market.  Definitely worth your money and time!
25744,"Like it more than 6.  Less than 4.
"
25745,It's fun. Full stop.
25746,"Banging game, you lose hours of the day each play"
25747,It's pretty fun
25748,Is good.
25749,"I used my dads account, but this game is very fun and well priced. Its much easier than EU4, very interactive, and the graphics are great to play with. Some elements are unrealistic, but otherwise, you should totally buy it."
25750,the netcode has been broken since release good fucking luck trying to play with your friends reeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee
25751,"Favourite game by far. Fun to look at, even the animals and waves are pleasant sounds. The maps are intriguing and fun to explore, the play is complex and many layered.  There are many ways to change the settings, and beyond that many user-created mods that can freshen the game all over again. The Ai is disappointing in the end, but good enough for thousands of hours of play. Online multi-player is not easy,  and either very slow or very fast, depending how you manage it. Missile units are over-powered. Still, this is such a cool game!"
25752,A beautiful waste of six hours.
25753,The civ deries is a classic for a reason.
25754,its alright i guess
25755,fun
25756,"This is THEE perfect TBS game. So much replayability it's insane and that's a huge factor for me. This game feeds my ADHD and can easily get sucked into a game, even playing by myself. Such a great game! So many ways to play and build your civilization."
25757,"Pretty cool game, i enjoy coming home and having the hopes and dreams of millions of virtual people depend on my choices. Entire populations of cities and countries look upon me with the hope that i approve of their existence, before accepting that i do not and are cast into the all-consuming fires of time. 10/10 pretty fun."
25758,"Good game... that is all. Though you do lose track of time and what you need to do irl, but ehh does not matter right?"
25759,"I kept getting attacked.  So, I devoted my entire economy to the military and annihilated everyone in the world.  Felt great."
25760,il liek this gam
25761,"Civ 5 is still the greatest turn based strategy ever.  I have tried 6 and it is a great game too, but 5 is where my heart is and I still find new ways to beat it and small details to explore.  It also moves along well as a single or multi player experience."
25762,"I like that you can lose a whole day on this and think its only been a couple of hours! You can really do what you want on this game, lots of different goals to work towards. A lot if un to play by yourself or multiplayer."
25763,its great
25764,l
25765,"seriously get it, all dlc necessary tho"
25766,"Game is the best civilization game out there, my only complaint is that this shit is a complete time torch. You think you have been playing for an hour and 8 hours have passed. Only play if you want to throw an entire day out the window."
25767,good
25768,4/5
25769,Still addictive
25770,love this game! but it needed more!
25771,is good game
25772,"In my opinion, the best of the CIV games. I only play offline vs bots :D"
25773,"Very fun, easy to pickup and play"
25774,This is one of the best strategy games I have ever played.
25775,"Excellent game, must have
"
25776,It's good
25777,great game
25778,good
25779,"Its a lot of fun to be the leader of a nation in a video game, play with my bother, very epic"
25780,"This is the definitive Civ, as far as I'm concerned.  I've got Civ 6 as well, but I prefer Civ 5 hands down.
I've put thousands of hours into this game on various platforms, and love it to bits.

If you like the idea of a Civ game, get this one rather than 6, in my humble opinion."
25781,amazing game
25782,It works
25783,The definitive Civilisation game. I have many more hours than steam says I do. This game is awesome.
25784,civ cities are civilised cits with several civil civs sitting in a civilised system
25785,"It can run on almost anything and is a really solid game. Endless hours of fun, I know quite a few people with over 1000 hours logged. I have had a really good time in LAN parties playing this game."
25786,good game
25787,"A hallmark of strategy games, just don't expect to finish a multiplayer game in any reasonable length of time."
25788,FUN SHIT
25789,game is good
25790,"fantastic strategy game, countless hours of fun with many different ways to win which leads to tons of replay ability"
25791,"If you like turn based strategy games, then this is a good investment. I"

25795,Yes
25796,fun
25797,"This game is a very enjoyable and timely use of enjoyment.
Love it."
25798,civ 5 better than civ 6 men
25799,This is the best game in the history of ever and if you don't like it you are a very bad stupid person. A dummyhead.
25800,what a game. truly beautiful.
25801,i lied
25802,fun
25803,"it is great fun in single player and multiplayer. Get it on CD-Keys with all the dlc for £8
+"
25804,Its alright i guess
25805,"Great modding community, and fun for AI-only games too. Totally didn't inflate my hours with AI-only games"
25806,More addictive than any drug i know.
25807,Great for gamenights with the boys and simulating WWIII
25808,It's ok...
25809," Gets boring quick, fun while not boring. 3/5
"
25810,"4X genre, play as any of the dozens of built in civilizations with unique traits or download mods and scenarios.
Addictive gameplay, custom rules to focus on science, diplomatic or warfare."
25811,"Good game: 4 out of 5
But
F#ck this game: 0 out of 5
Recommended"
25812,Just plain fun
25813,The Best Civ there is Civ5 ! Civ6 is an embarrassment to civ.
25814,issa good
25815,"If you just need to rewind, re-energize yourself or kill some time during a flight or something. This game will do it for ya."
25816,:)
25817,Bad Game
25818,I freaking like this game alot.
25819,One of the best Civilization yet.
25820,civ 5 > civ 6
25821,"cant play with pc, i have a mac. it is dumb"
25822,"""I was literally sending settlers to make a city right there, dammit siam""

""George, get off my border, you have like 15 units on my border.""

""Wait, I forgot to talk to China again""

""Lhasa will die.""

- And other things you'll probably say while playing this game"
25823,fun
25824,It's OK I guess.
25825,"2020, Hi-end PC, and the turns still take forever.

Miss le ol' civ 2.

But, overall, a good game."
25826,"Likes: ""One more turn""

Dislikes: Waking up the morning after, after having only 2 hours of sleep because of ""one more turn"""
25827,is fun
25828,Amazing
25829,"Very fun game! Was recommended to me by a friend and the game did not disappoint for one of my first PC games. I would recommend this game to anyone, I have no complaints."
25830,it good
25831,Awesome Game!!!
25832,"Very well kept game, still good now."
25833,Honestly a very well rounded strategy game
25834,best version of civ game ive played!
25835,"Unbalanced faction, garbage combat, nonsensical political and trade mechanics"
25836,amazing game
25837,ebic game
25838,"Time enjoyed is not time wasted. 
I love civ 6 but for different reasons. 
Civ 5 was great and I never had any regrets. 
I still play it from time to time. I prefer 6 tho."
25839,It's the best game.
25840,Fun with and without friends. I recommend this game to anyone that sees review. Good game and I really enjoyed the time I spent playing.
25841,Love how the game plays. Time to win seems realistic if you don't take scientific dark ages into affect.
25842,Pretty okay
25843,"Good strategy game, good way to waste the day and keep your virginity - 10:10 would recommend"
25844,"East to learn, hard to master. But you will  enjoy a lot once you have mastered this masterpiece."
25845,.
25846,Every game is different.  Setup is customizable in almost any way you can think.
25847,the best game ever
25848,Just a super solid game
25849,fun game
25850,Awesome game!  I've put in well over 2K hours.  Playing all of the scenarios and attempting new achievements.  I've been playing CIV since CIV1.  Plan to try out CIV6 in about a year or two.
25851,"Made allies with everyone, Then nuked every last one of them. 10/10"
25852,great crack with no quiters and online but dull by your self
25853,The perfect game for any fan of turn-based strategy. (Civ V > Civ VI)
25854,Meep Meep
25855,the best
25856,Starting a game if fun but also well balanced to make you want to finish it.
25857,Best turn-based game out there.  Hands down.
25858,Classic
25859,fun
25860,Still my favorite in the series.
25861,I've played too much of this game
25862,always been a follower of Civilization. love the game.
25863,.
25864,Best Civ game by far.
25865,"Quite possibly better than Civ6. I tried playing Civ6 and despite playing on the easiest difficulty, it was like playing on the hardest setting. Civ5 is far less complicated and convoluted that Civ6. I guess that's why stats show that Civ5 is still popular than Civ6. Despite Civ6 obviously having better graphics, Civ5 has the better gameplay. So I recommend Civ5 over Civ6."
25866,"Civilization V is a great game, one in which I have countless hours, and one in which I will undoubtedly spend countless more in. A game that allows you to write history yourself is bound to create a multitude of fond memories you will look back on. The game has near infinite replayability, as you will never be able to tell the outcome from the start of a game.  Even a decade after its initial release, it still has a strong playerbase. If you manage to tire yourself of the base game, there are multiple game altering DLC that can increase your enjoyment, and after that there is a giant modding scene around the game. One can never get board of Civilization V."
25867,Fun
25868,"Civ 5 is the best civ, don't forget about the giant death robots"
25869,yip yip mf
25870,"I'm 728 hours into this game so yes I obviously recommend it. I'm a new gamer but I'm an achievement-driven gamer and this game has a bunch of those. I've literally been playing for 7 years and still striving to get all the achievements. I started with this game and got Civ Vi and Beyond Earth and I love the whole franchise. If you like strategy games like Heroes of Might and Magic, this is definitely worth checking out! Just try it, I think you'll become a fan!"
25871,great game played for hours love it with friends
25872,"big learning curve, but fun"
25873,"One of the best, if not THE best Civ games.  Dont like the DLC's value but other than that the game is solid as ever"
25874,"So much fun, and so many different ways to set up your game!"
25875,"Fantastic game absolutely love the graphics and the game play, something about it keeps drawing me back to go for the achievements"
25876,"The last,best incarnation of classic Civilization."
25877,Challenging yet understandable.
25878,"Civ 5 never goes on sale so Firaxis can force the new player base over to civ six.  Which is a broken game that is near unplayable without the 40 dollar dlc packs
"
25879,"I have to make sure I have an entire day to play this game because I simply CANNOT STOP PLAYING IT. Super fun, and you always want to play just one more turn."
25880,So much fun!
25881,good game
25882,"A good game for wet afternoons, play for an hour, or play the same game for days, I found it interesting and often frustrating in getting so far, only to be frustrated by a kingdom which is always one step ahead. I've had the game for some time and play it when I have time. Personally I find the game sufficient for my personality."
25883,Fun time management game.
25884,"It's awesome but I'm not 
"
25885,its a game of wonder... that is all i am going to say
25886,is gud
25887,yes
25888,
25889,its a good game specially if you can put the hours into it
25890,"If you've never played a civ game before, you have to. In the game you create a nation from the beginning of man all the way up to modern times. The game is ridiculously in depth, with a ton of replay value. Not to mention that each match can take well over 20 hours."
25891,"GOOD GAME!!!
"
25892,One of the best turn based games I've ever played.  Civ IV and Civ 5 are amazing.
25893,fun game. many hours of think. much socializing. wow
25894,game for stupid people
25895,My all time favorite. Beat this game to death and I still keep coming back to it.
25896,its fun
25897,I love this game.  That's just it. Its great.
25898,is good
25899,"This game is very good for someone looking to get into strategy games, it's very simple to get into and understand. It allows you to run a country in a game, without making you memorize a bunch or rules or get used to a complicated UI."
25900,I played civ as mongolia and suddenly I realized I was against MBT's and sacked every city. Now I am sacking my neighbourhood and I speak fluent mongolian. This certainly bettered my life and existance. A good review from me.
25901,this is my favorite game of all time
25902,"Interesting setup, intriguing match ups and you can speed pace of play"
25903,the very gucci
25904,Absolutely great
25905,I keep coming back to this game its just too good
25906,It's good
25907,muy bien
25908,Replayability
25909,one.more.turn.
25910,I love Civilization since the first game. This one is just great.
25911,jesus fuck u cant stop playing
25912,An improvement on the previous classic instalments of the Civilization games. I have found the game extremely entertaining with options for gameplay customizations allowing for a variable challenge range and gameplay experience. Nearly endless options allow for recurrent replay-ability and the multiple means by which to win and experience the game promote a new experience for each playthrough.
25913,In some ways I prefer this over Civ 6.
25914,This game is impossible to stop playing when you start
25915,one of the best games ever if you like slow stratigy games
25916,10/10 would invade Persia again
25917,YAAAAAAASSS QUEEN
25918,good
25919,"I do not play that much of strategy genre but this game is awesome. After 5-10 hours of playing you really get the hang of it. It is well polished and balanced in my opinion. Only problem I encounter is, as the game progress the AI take longer and longer to respond. This is due to the immense number of movements it takes (I presume) and it is as expected. We encountered lags when we played online a couple of times but not to much of a problem.  This game can be played many hours and would not bore you. It is that immersive."
25920,fantastic game for when you want to chill
25921,"Many an hour put into this game, always just one more turn. If you like 4x or Turn Based games. I would highly recommend, along with the sequel Civ 6."
25922,lit conquests with the bois
25923,its shit
25924,"Ching chong
Germany greatest leader is wrong."
25925,"The best civ...well balanced, fun to play, and gorgeous to look at."
25926,"super fun, works well and overall the best civ game in the series in my opinon
"
25927,"excellent if you're looking for an engaging foray into strategy games. this game has so much for you to do, so it doesn't cease to be interesting shortly after you start playing. i got the game 2 months ago and i have 300 hours already. 10/10"
25928,good
25929,GREAT GAME
25930,"Amazing game that you can play and play. You can play a game one way and then play it exactly the opposite. It allows for a huge range of in-depth strategic gameplay that, even though it can take a while sometimes, isn't boring."
25931,Just buy it. It's beautiful. I've spent over 400 hours on this game and had to be pried away from it. There are few games that have consumed me in the way this game does. One more turn. Always just one more turn.
25932,Very good. Become an arabian merchant god and win.
25933,Best place to let your brain work
25934,it's a fun little game and i think you should give it a try. im sure there's a way to play it but i just like making my units run around in circles.
25935,i love it
25936,I've played this game for over 900 hours. Yeah. It's that good.
25937,BLURB
25938,One of the best games I've ever played. no further comments
25939,"good
"
25940,Probably the best game in the series.   Good strategy game with lots of fun scenarios.
25941,"10/10 Best game for wasting all your time on. One minute its 1pm, the next its 1am"
25942,it be dope
25943,Don't get play this game if you're a student I almost failed my final year of uni trying to get Gandhi to give up his nukes.
25944,"Very good turn based strategy game. I recommend this more than Civ 6. Though the AI can be rather stupid and overpowered on some higher difficulties, it is still a very good title."
25945,"Perfect game. I've played for thousands of hours (didn't have internet for a few years, and played it pirated for the first year or so) and I've found so many ways to play that I love. The base game is great, but the expansions made it my GOAT game. Online is a little weird sometimes, but I also play on Mac."
25946,It speaks for itself.
25947,"Playing this game is what I can only expect to be the exact same feelings as Odysseus when he encountered the Lotus-eaters, or maybe could be compared to the Bermuda Triangle."
25948,"Removed compatibility with pc & mac, still a great game."
25949,150 hours later.....
25950,"Highly recommend, the game is most enjoyable with all the DLC's. Not as in-depth/realistic as the Paradox series but that is not the purpose of the game. This game is entertaining and very fun with friends/groups."
25951,it is a fun game.
25952,Good game.
25953,Great
25954,I've played numerous different CIV games and loved them all
25955,fun
25956,Multi level strategy with good balance if you play at the right level.   Variety of civilisations to choose from to suit any play style   Looks good and performs well.
25957,"Ghandi, maybe more."
25958,I'm just adding 1 more positive review. Don't mind me
25959,"Its a very fun, well made game"
25960,Its the most wonderful pain in the world
25961,fun tatical
25962,great game
25963,I guess it's an okay game. :)
25964,"On Modern CPU/GPUs this game behaves as if it were running on C64. Late in game, wait time for your turn can be a few minutes, which is unimaginary."
25965,"This is a great game, has lots of replay value because there's so many combinations of scenarios. I'd highly recommend this to people who like games like Age of Empires."
25966,"If you have even the slightest interest in history, foreign politics, or warfare, I feel safe recommending this game to you if you're 9-years-old, 90, or somewhere in between. It's a relatively simple game, but the kind that feels like a comfortable bathrobe. This is the only game I can happily play for 7 hours straight and feel as if 30 minutes have passed. It's not without a few minor flaws, but when the game is this praiseworthy, it's easy to overlook those little things. Needless to say, if you play for over 5 hours, the music will get a little repetitive, but it's great (well-fitting) music so I don't mind.
~ ~ ~
I score this game a [b]9.5/10[/b], with 0/10 being offensively awful and 10/10 being much better than I could reasonably hope for. 
"
25967,dank
25968,its a very addictive strategy game with tons of different play stiles.
25969,I think the hours speak for themselves
25970,Good game
25971,amazing
25972,"it's fun, i like the game a lot"
25973,GREAT GAME
25974,good
25975,Best value for money game I ever bought
25976,Its good bob
25977,"one of the greatest PC games of all time. None of the other Civ games compare, though I do find the first Civ Rev quite enjoyable for console."
25978,"One of the most addictive games out there.  If you enjoy 4X games, this is a must-play."
25979,Very good
25980,Just one more turn......
25981,Legends never die!
25982,10/10 Nuclear Gandhi
25983,Typical Civ
25984,It's a good game.
25985,gud game <3
25986,The Beastly Game!
25987,it's fun
25988,"Lotta fun. Had a learning curve, but still played the shit out of it and I usually dn't like these sorts of games."
25989,good game
25990,"Easily a Must-Buy strategy game.  Very addictive and can be chaotically fun for hours with friends.  Even if you don't have many friends (like me lmao), you'll still have loads of fun alone.  Or alternatively, you can try your luck with the servers and play with other randoms.  Just keep in mind that most of the public servers are dead, but overall, I highly recommend buying this game (as well as it's DLC) whenever you can.  Especially if it goes on sale."
25991,"Endless options for easy or hard, different leaders and maps keeps each game interesting"
25992,"Literal time machine. ""One More Turn"" is another 8 hours magically gone."
25993,The only game that lets you become the facist dicator of your dreams.
25994,Nice
25995,I is great and cheaper than civ 6.
25996,sweet
25997,"The classic strategy game.  I've been a Civ fan since I got Civilization 2 free with my new computer in 1995.  Civ 5 is a great addition to the classic series.  It took me a bit to get used to not being able to stack units but after I did, I totally agree with the change.  I liked this game better than I liked the previous iterations except for Civ 2.  (Alas, that one will always hold the privileged place in my mind.)  I'm moving on the Civ 6 now but it is a shame I've only put on 127 hours into this game."
25998,It has its flaws but it's one of the best Civ games.
25999,One more turn
26000,it good
26001,its gud
26002,Probably the last of the Civ games which is true to the original gameplay. Civ V removes the Doom stacks but keeps most of the other mechanics much the same. If you are after a true Civ game then this is it.
26003,A game with hundreds more hours of enjoyment to be achieved from it. Would recommend!
26004,cherry on top chief
26005,pretty fun
26006,Great way to waste massive volumes of time
26007,everything
26008,Hands down the best Civ game I've ever played... The single player at least. The multiplayer is wonky at the best of times.
26009,It's alright
26010,a
26011,i dont get why im having so much fun doing the same strat every time but i like it. 10/10 would build wonders again
26012,Great Fun
26013,good
26014,the internet play is super slow what you
26015,osom
26016,"If you like turn-based, civilization building strategy games, then you can't go wrong with any of the Sid Meier's Civilization games."
26017,Best way to time travel so far.
26018,best civ game!
26019,can spend hours playing without getting bored
26020,very cool
26021,very fun but long game will take multpile siting to finsh a single game but that is to be expected of a civ game and for new player you learn most of the stuff you will need to know if you first playthrought of the game.
26022,
26023,Enjoying the game so far! Multiplayer is pretty seamless and addicting.
26024,im ghandi and i nuked the polish.
26025,"Civ is fun, with friend or by yourself, dont get civ 6 tho its spyware l m a o."
26026,this game is still as amazing as at was when it came out best civ ever!!
26027,"Civ 5 is the crown jewel of strategy games.  Rich gameplay with replayability through variety, challenge, and exploration.  I enjoy trying out new methods of winning under strange environmental conditions and find myself completely engrossed"
26028,Its fun as hell but you have to have a monster sized brain like myself to actually understand and enjoy the game.
26029,Spare time=gone
26030,"great with friends, especially when yo back-stab them"
26031,yes
26032,Fun with friends
26033,"it's pretty good, yeah. i have played for many moons. war is hell, though"
26034,I think this is the best civilization game!
26035,It's the best Civ period. My hours on it are legit.  It's amazing in that I am still very good at King level and it  still surprises me.  The best money on a game I have ever spent.
26036,I've had this game for several years and find the replayability & modability to be the greatest assets of the game.
26037,"Civilization 5 makes you feel like you are shaping the world with each decision you make. For a game that marketed itself off the grandiose ""create a nation to last the ages"" it does not disappoint.

Sincerely recommended."
26038,One of the best RTS ever made!
26039,The amount of depth and fun you can have in this game is crazy
26040,"Okay, Graphics, great gameplay, and uncountable ways to customize the game your way. can get a little long at times but otherwise a great and fun pc game"
26041,meh
26042,good game
26043,Im not a hardcore master player but the game is super balanced and my friend with 100s of hours keeps losing to me so i must say its a great game i would highly recommend to people who just like to conquer and prosper
26044,"Its a good game, full of mods and highly functioning A.I's"
26045,"Fantastic game, every hour was totally worth it"
26046,One of the best game for connection at the airport.
26047,A classic. Well worth the price tag.
26048,turn on quick combat and movement. A nice change to combat form civ 4
26049,Love it best game ever
26050,One of addicting games

26057,Its a classic that can keep you busy for hours
26058,great game :)
26059,Excellent game to think about your every move. Yeah it isn't a perfect but what is nowadays.
26060,yeet
26061,Good game with multiple re-play values!
26062,"I play Japan to spread the hentai through culture victory, every game I get beat by my friends but the hentai lives on."
26063,if you get a mod that adds Thatcher you can nuke Thatcher and I find that really appealing as she absolutely ruined the greatest britain
26064,"chill game, fun"
26065,Good Game
26066,very fun im a mongolia main they are good

26082,I am not usually in to video games but this game is my one vice. Always a great one to go back to and easily the best turn based strategy game I have ever played
26083,fun easy to play and a great game
26084,its fantastic!
26085,lekmod gang
26086,"Fantastic game! Worth every penny and far better gameplay than 6. always new and exciting. I have never played a game where I can spend hours and hours on a map, quit and start a new one and feel excited about it. Every start is a new adventure, challenge and exploring adventure! My favourite achievement was on 14 Jun, 2018 @ 3:43pm when I achieved ""flawless strategy"" :)"
26087,pretty good game
26088,"Great game I keep returning to, time and time again."
26089,good game fun to play
26090,gud geme
26091,best Civ in my opinion
26092,"Great game, plus with all the DLC you can easily go into the hundreds of hours played."
26093,A fun game. Many hours have been spent playing this and i'm actually yet to even complete a whole game :)
26094,"Fantasic game, just keep in mind that time is reletive in the world of Civ and that you lose hours playing it"
26095,Good game.
26096,s
26097,Simply the best version of all the Civs - great replayability
26098,Gooooood
26099,Good game but multiplayer is to easy

26101,This game is perfect to relax to.
26102,A strategy game worth playing many times
26103,Still better than VI
26104,It is honestly one of the best games i have played.
26105,"fantastic game. it would be hard to recommend this or civ 6 as they're both really good. while the graphics could be better, the game play is fun and addicting, and the city organisation is enjoyable. overall i would rate this 9/10"
26106,"The best turn-based history related strategy game out there. DON'T buy Civilization 6, buy Civilization 5, it's way better.

"
26107,Very nice :)
26108,educational and fun to play with a bunch of friends
26109,"I've finished about 2 games? This game is amazing! Make sure you get all the DLC too, probably in a bundle when it goes on sale."
26110,"Best Game Ever

26130,Just  finished my  first game

26133,It's okay
26134,"The game is well constructed easy to play the graphics are clear and nice the game concept is well thought out and the game itself is entertaining without being boring able to play for hours and still not feel tired 
"
26135,10/10 game right here. I fell in love instantly and was hooked for many many hours. Highly recommend!
26136,Absolute Masterpiece
26137,its ight
26138,Best of the series!
26139,great game!!
26140,"The most consistently enjoyable 4x game of all time IMO. Racked up a lot of game time and would recommend the 'Community Mod' as an essential add-on (free) to improve key aspects such as AI, balance and user interface - especially for the single player. Civ 5 is not perfect, especially in terms of diplomacy and some of the map / nation choices that can vary from super easy to win to fiendish difficult! Replayability (with the mods) is reasonably high and the multiple victory conditions are all achievable which is a rare feature for these type of games. If you have only played Civ 6 or 4 then 5 might be a bit of a culture shock due to the significant differences but if you can persevere, you will quickly understand why this game sits in so many 'top ten of all time' list that abound the web."
26141,Ive been playing civilazation since it first came out.. I strongly believe its good for keeping the mind active.. I*m 80 years old and im still playing it.
26142,yes
26143,"With the complete package in the bag ( all dlc's ) 
and... with prior experience of civ ( started playing in civ 4 ) 
and latter experience ( civ beyond earth ) 
This game remains fun....
my playstyle is best described as casual,
often stopped during the middle ages 
all in all if you have an older system 
buy the complete game during a sale 
you can have many casual fun hours against the a.i. for years to come"
26144,Yes
26145,"fantastic strategy game following suit of Sid Meier's previous classics, superb!"
26146,"I wish Civ 6 was exactly this, however Civ 6 lets you bind units to each other to create a unit which is extraordinarily helpful for escorting vulnerable units; this is the only problem with Civ 5. 
Civ 5 > Civ 6"
26147,"Very addictive. Let's you focus on different aspects, and war is very taxing (as it should)."
26148,good yes good
26149,better than civ 6 imo!!
26150,"A fun time killer, a REALLY BIG time killer"
26151,it rocks
26152,Classic
26153,"Most dramatic change to the CIV game since CIV 3, the best of the series by far."
26154,its a good game
26155,"it's great for everyone, it doesn't matter if you want to take over the world or just get some art"
26156,10/10 would play again
26157,"If Ghandi wielding a nuclear warhead doesn't get you going, this game isn't for you."
26158,884
26159,Primary Objective: Eliminate Ghandi
26160,best
26161,"In my opinion, Civ 5 is a very addictive turn-based game that requires a lot of free time to fully complete the game starting from Ancient era to the Information era. You might spend the entire day just to get to the information era. It is one of my favorite games on Steam. The game itself is easy to learn and also easy to play especially if you ever played the previous series of Civ's game. Even though game is kind of expensive to buy around $15 on normal price but yeah... i think it's still worth it."
26162,Infromative.
26163,Without a doubt the best civilization game ever!
26164,"I love
"
26165,fuck yeah civ v
26166,"Great game to play with friends, one simply cannot go wrong!"
26167,This game is great!
26168,Solid game with countless hours of replay value.  Great addition to the Civilization series.
26169,It was a great game to get in and kick butt. If you are looking for a challenge it can offer that too. Just a fun little game.
26170,it is fun and you get to learn about history while playing
26171,One of my all time favorites! A fun world sim that gives you loads of directions in which to take your country. Would recommend.
26172,fun
26173,Great play with friends.
26174,"Best of all the Civilization games made, recommend this over VI"
26175,9.5/10. Has a little something for everybody.
26176,"Never gets old
"
26177,"One of my favorite, most explicit Civ's!"
26178," Fuck, its been 600 hours?"
26179,Classic
26180,Good
26181,"Highly recommended 4X classic masterpiece.

If you are new to turn-based 4X strategy, then you can do no wrong in playing this. This is so well made that the most recent iteration of the series isn't even necessary. I am content just coming back to this version whenever the need strikes me. It also stands up well over time with clean visual and audio, flawless controls and is the definition of easy to learn, hard to master."
26182,Really Good
26183,It is fun to play.
26184,Every game is a new experience even at 1k+ hours and 65-70% achievement completion. I love that it's not only strategic challenging but makes you invent tactics and think tactically. Great game.
26185,"it good, 
i play long, many years
buy if you want, make no matter to me"
26186,"Entertaining to play, especially  with friends and can fundamentally f**k  them over too!
10/10"
26187,I love world domination
26188,Very Good!
26189,"I have played 3 games, seems pretty good"
26190,luv it
26191,Noice
26192,Yeah gud 1
26193,Good strategy game with a few flaws. Namely the AI is retarded.
26194,jjjk
26195,"fuck george washington. If i could go back in time and alter any event in history, I would make sure that cherry tree came down on his dumbass fuckin face. good game tho"
26196,It's Good.
26197,Good stuff tho.
26198,"lots of fun, but games take forever."
26199,This is an awesome nerd game.

26206,"Отличнейшая игра!
А вместе с модами реиграбельна до усрачки."
26207,so fricking good and everybody knows it but i'll say it again
26208,Fun game as usual.  Recommend downloading some mods to change up the gameplay for more fun.
26209,"Great game series, but not as funny as Civ 2."
26210,Ya its pretty good I guess
26211,game good yes
26212,Fun game! The best in the series imo (better than VI). Played 300 hours and still love it. Very well done.
26213,It was enjoyable!
26214,Good game
26215,I love the in depth strategy of all facets of running a country
26216,its a great no internet game
26217,"I am not great on writing reviews to be honest, but this game is one of the finest games I ever played. It's complexity can be a bit overwhelming at first,  but after you learned how to play, it is really fun. I am really far from mastering the game, but I enjoy it nonetheless.

TL, DR: After you learned how to play, it's hella lit."
26218,Its always learning something new. You need to give it more than one try before you judge!
26219,"Logged almost 1000hrs into the game and that's barely touching modded content. Absolutely recommend for any lovers of 4X genre. Standard and straightforward, not the most adventurous title in the series or genre but still a classic game that WILL steal days of your life if you let it."
26220,hours of fun
26221,"better than 6, get all the DLC"
26222,ghandi
26223,"Didn't think i would like this kinda game, 1 game and several hours later all i can think about is playing again"
26224,Too addicting!!!
26225,This game has great replayability. You can spend lots of hours playiing it and have fun with every playthrough.
26226,this is some hot stuff boys
26227,"A fantastic addition to the Civ franchise.

My greatest complaint with previous Civ games, which I've been playing since 1996, was that large armies were extremely unwieldy and frustrating to manage. Sea transportation logistics were also a frustrating time sink. Both of these problems have been solved with Civ V.

Everything about the game screams polish and it runs like an absolute dream, haven't had a hitch yet which is becoming so rare with new releases."
26228,yes
26229,its aight
26230,Great graphics. Great grameplay. 10/7
26231,Haven't played Civilization 6.  This game is still fun after all these years.  Great for multiplayer and singleplayer.  Huge amounts of customization that doesn't limit the player.  One of the best games in its genre and that I've played on PC.
26232,"It's ........ okay, I guess."
26233,Loads of fun. Probably the best Civ game
26234,Fun game. Still playing it in 2020.
26235,get it or you will be sad
26236,this game has caused me to break my desk multiple times
26237,It's okay
26238,Great game that makes time disappear
26239,"Yes, but wait for a sale. I got the game and all DLC for less than $5."
26240,"fun game, Ai is better than previous versions."
26241,epic
26242,I have always loved playing the CIVI games. Always fun to go back to.
26243,"Played this for a little bit, seems ok"
26244,
26245,"So good! No death stacks, leads to more strategy."
26246,Game fun
26247,Terrific game but will consume a lot of your time learning to conquer and run the whole world.
26248,"Civ V is a very nice casual game that, in the diety mode, will keep you entertained for hours"
26249,It's a good game. I don't want to leave a long review.
26250,Everything about this game is just great
26251,10/10 would play again.
26252,"yeah ok, good."
26253,everybody gangsta till gandhi enters the modern era
26254,Pretty fun but maybe simpler than Civ IV.
26255,Great time waster.
26256,Maximum replayability and a million Steam achievements.
26257,Its good. Fin.
26258,"its prettttyyyy goood
"
26259,Great game highly recommend but make sure to buy it with all the dlc
26260,"Good but bad, not as bad as Civ 6, but gooder than civ 4."
26261,"ITS AMAZING, very engaging and fun to just chill out and play"
26262,sid if you are reading this put your seed inside me
26263,"A longstanding game of strategy, diplomacy, and ultimate conquest. A much improved form of Civ 6, IMO."
26264,"yes
"
26265,As good as Money Store
26266,"It is fucking civilization, what do you expect?"
26267,Great game!
26268,This game plays more like a board game than a turn based strategy game but it has won my heart. You need to be able to accept some quite humorous at times anachronisms like Gen. Patton being born to the Greeks in 300 BC and similar events that trigger my autism but also make me laugh.
26269,Civ 5 has been a great game to play! I recommend it if you like turned based games. The way I generally play it is through warfare and I like the way that there are good options for units as you progress.
26270,"If your a fan of the RTS genre then your gonna love this game. It combines many aspects of the RTS genre with a few sprinklings of surprises and fun, along with mod support so you could play as Adolf Hitler if you really wanted to. (Definitely makes a WWII roleplay much more fun)"
26271,Great game. You lose yourself to hours of this game. Best way to time travel.
26272,"GOod Game, very fun with friends!"
26273,BEST. GAYME. EVER.
26274,d
26275,Just buy the complete edition!!!
26276,"The best of all civ games with an excellent mod community! Even without mods, the replay value is good! Definitely something to add to your game library."
26277,!
26278,ehhhhhnh
26279,The DLC make this game so much more complete
26280,The amount of hours ive played says enough
26281,dfsgds
26282,its just a great game. best of the civ series. better than civ 6
26283,Meh...I could take it or leave it anytime I want......I swear!
26284,ha
26285,it's leet
26286,"One of the most solid strategy games that i know of. Is it balanced? No. No it is not. What leader you choose will have an enourmous influence on how you can win the game. But depending on scenario, even the leaders with the most niche abilities bring something useful to the table.

It's a time consumer, yet, it's something even a parent can play, because it is turnbased, and you can always just get up and leave the game for later.

One of the most commendable things in this game, compared to so many others, is its incredibly wellworking game lobby: The whole steam-friends join game, thing works great, and its just solid. If the host crashes a player takes over as host, and the host can rejoin the game as a player. I play on Linux, my wife on windows, and every just works exactly as it should."
26287,gud
26288,"Civilization V is a fine game. If you've never played a Civ game before, V is an extremely solid entry in the series. Wishlist this one and buy it when it's on sale. It's usually pretty balls cheap.

Civ is a turn-based state-management/war strategy game, where you begin by choosing a historic leader of a real-world civilization, and you try to lead them to victory starting from the stone/bronze age and spanning all the way into the 21st century. You need to manage your civilization's workers, construction projects, money, armed forces, scientific focus, trade, religion, espionage, and expansion of borders. It's extremely intricate, yet the UI and mouse-hover-over tips make this game extremely easy to pick up for a game genre that's usually pretty brutal towards newcomers and learning curves.

It's like a very complicated, yet addicting board game. If you like strategy games or even history at all, you'll most certainly love this game. The DLC, which often also becomes dirt cheap on sale, sincerely adds a lot more depth and replayability to the game, so if you want it, go for it. You won't be disappointed in that department either.

The only real downsides that I can think of are the AI being pretty wonky, some UI could be optimized a little better, and there is some imbalance of units or even civilization perks. That said, there are plenty of mods out there that fix all these problems and are very easy to set up, so I recommend those as well (especially the superior UI and notifications in game).

Great place to test the waters to see if you like the Civ series, especially now that the older games in the series are starting to become fairly antiquated, and Civ 6 has less than stellar reviews and price point."
26289,cossacks op
26290,"Sid Meier's Civilization® V is a really addictive turn-based strategy game. Once you start a game and start playing, you suddenly realize that you have been playing for 10 hours.

+ Beautiful game
+ Runs pretty well
+ A lot of content
+ Fun
+/- Very addictive
- A couple of crashes here and there, nothing too major.
+/- DLC's are a must if you want to enjoy the whole game, but they are definitely worth it.

9,5/10"
26291,Just...one...more...turn. Says it all!
26292,Great game to just simply keep occupied. Has gotten better over the years.
26293,its good
26294,"Super fun, super addicting, great in single and multiplayer. One of my most-played games ever."
26295,only complaint: the cavalry retreated
26296,Just one more turn
26297,Solid game that has stood the test of time fairly well. Frequent problems and poor balance for certain CIVs makes vanilla gameplay frustrating but with the two expansions and mods you can put as many hours as you want to into the game.
26298,"Good strategy game. Really relaxing :)
"
26299,Good good

26302,I have loved these games since the first one on the PS1 when the further you got into the game it took an hour for the enemy to take their turn. Absolutely love how these games have evolved and got better over time
26303,.
26304,this game is as it is....Great.
26305,addicted
26306,"I enjoy the thought process that has to go into the game. The thinking and comprehension really intrigues me to be able to progress through the game, as well as the many different routes you can take through the game."
26307,Moved from Civ 2 to this and was happy with the changes made between games. Game is a good mix of fun and challenging.
26308,it good
26309,good
26310,"Babylon is fair, balanced, and fun to play against"

26315,This got me through many a lecture in my classes. Excellent game.
26316,Awesome

26319,It's a masterpiece. That's all I can really say
26320,Scharnhorst is the best ship
26321,This is a great Civilization Game.
26322,Fun
26323,This game is dangerous as you will play for three hours and it feels like you just got started
26324,Very Good!
26325,perfect to scratch the strategy sim itch
26326,very nice game too play for relaxing your brain
26327,Well Done!
26328,You can nuke cities. Y E S .
26329,yes
26330,this game so so much fun and the updates and mods make it so much better then the other civs  that have come out
26331,"One of the best 4X games ever released, hands down amazing.

Mod support for this game is fantastic, 5 years on and there's still frequent updates to the workshop. Additionally, a plethora of old classics provide new takes on the game - from true start locations to total gameplay overhauls such as NQ and Vox Populi, not to mention the insane numbers of civilizations added to the game as mods - pretty much any state in any period of history is playable. I also really like the fact that mods do not disable achievements in this game, it's a nice touch and allows you to play freely without being punished.

The balance of the game is questionable at best, but apart from a few noticeable civs (Babylon and Poland both being very powerful, whilst Venice is pathetically weak) all civs are adequately balanced. The policy choices are the real issue, with some choices such as Tradition being significantly more powerful than others, such as Liberty, but there are mods to fix this for free.

The AI is for the most part good, it's nothing special but I never had moments where the AI had a meltdown (common in Civ VI). The advantages given to the AI on higher difficulties are subtle (with the noticeable exception of Deity) and aren't noticeable to the player. The AI generally performed well over all without making stupid choices, and is significantly improved from IV.

The game's combat system is a huge step up from Civ IV, but a huge step down from Civ VI. If you're interested in only the combat side, this isn't the game for you. AI in combat was mediocre on attack but abysmal on defence; they put up an awful attempt at resistance and demonstrate impressively poor organisation - a rapid attack on an outlying city will likely not invoke a heavy military response for 10+ turns, even if the civ has a massively stronger military than you. This improves with the research of flight as the AI will use bombing runs tactically to cover for its poor organisation, but this strategy is the only real attempt they show at stopping this.

Research progression throughout the game is snappy and polished, units are well spaced (with the sole exception of Long Swordsmen, who are a joke as they're replaced by Musketmen in 6 turns) and provide a well balanced edge - higher tech troops have a strong advantage over weaker men but a large army of older units are still able to hold their own against a slightly smaller number of higher tech ones.

The economy is the best its ever been, with trade routes and deals split to not penalise you for trading with people far from your homeland, whilst still allowing you a strong income from the countries closer to your borders. Income can come from a wide range and is well balanced with expenses, overall a very polished system.

Unfortunately, the same cannot be said for the happiness system, which penalises the player for rapid expansion extremely harshly. Why this is the case is beyond me, but it's disappointing. Should you attempt a heavy expansionist run, I advise you use a mod to overhaul the happiness system.

Thankfully, the 4 victory conditions are all well polished (with DLC, the Utopia Project is a weak ending and Tourism is a far better system, introduced with DLC). Domination requires only the capitals, so you don't waste time chasing down pathetic settlements located in the middle of nowhere, Diplomacy requires a military strong enough to influence the world and an economy to match, allowing you to truly earn the title World Leader, Science also requires you to have good logistics to assemble and launch the rocket to Alpha Centurai and Culture encourages you to open your doors to the world and teach everyone your empire's ways. All 4 are incredibly rewarding

Fuck multiplayer though. If you try it, good luck dealing with the awful netcode. Whilst I'd recommend this over Civ 6 for single player, if you're doing multiplayer you'll have a much more polished experience with Civ 6.

TL;DR :

An incredible game, VERY accessible to new players to the civ franchise or 4X genre as a whole. Usually drops to 10€ on the sale, with all DLC included - and you DO want all of them, yes ALL of them. Don't bother getting the game without a MINIMUM of Gods and Kings and Brave New World."
26332,kinda sad right now but itsa cool game
26333,Its alright
26334,Best Civ game I've ever played including 6.
26335,yo it is fun
26336,"its cool challenging and fun, love the diplomacy stuff"
26337,gud
26338,It's a classic
26339,10/10
26340,"Amazing CIV game!

VI looks cartoony, holding out for VII"
26341,Civ V is the ultimate time waster. Time goes into a void when playing. The game sucks you in and it will go from 1:00 in the afternoon to 4:00 am in the blink of an eye. The strategy and gameplay is so absorbent and enjoyable that you just can't put it down. With friends the game becomes even more fun at times as players start filling roles and funny moments ensue. In single player watching your little empire grow and dominate is fun to watch. Civ V is an amazing game with infinite replay value. If this game is on sale with all DLC it is a must buy for any PC user.
26342,War is always an option.
26343,i have never heard of this game.
26344,It's the best Civilization. Only play the Complete Edition.
26345,It's a great game that let's you experience being a country. That's weird!
26346,nukes good war bad
26347,A nice layout together with the familiar CIV experience.
26348,This is one of the best 4x strategy games of all time.  It is definitely better than Civ 6.
26349,Easy to get addicted but each turn is fun. DLC good too
26350,Ghandi nuked me
26351,I ain't no video game expert but when the whole thing's on for like 15 bucks it's definitely worth it. Don't get the base game without the DLC though. G+K is necessary and BNW takes the game to new heights.
26352,good.
26353,"hemmel
"
26354,i really liked how much more streamlined it was than civ revolutions. the only other game of the series that i have played.
26355,well balanced game with plenty of challenges. It is entertaining and builds both strategic and tactical skills
26356,"The strategic view makes this the best Civ since the first one. Plus, lots of other cool stuff."
26357,"One day, y'all will understand that the struggle is real...but , for now, let's just enjoy an apple and some chocolate chip cookies.  Also, I enjoy a bit of chex mix while i play this game."

26365,Good
26366,Great game
26367,Great game. Still have fun when I play every once in a while.
26368,very fun strategy game that's easy to play for 6 hours at a time
26369,Oh yeah?
26370,"i wanna start off with. this is NOT a game for everyone. you need hella strategy. if you don't like that then you won't like this game

apart from that, the game can be both relaxing and incredibly frustrating. there are hundred of ways to play the game but few ways to actually win, and each leader has their own benefits and the dlc are good at times

some cons i have is if you want to have good maps then you have to download them since in my opinion, the starting maps aren't that good.
another con is that it can take hours for just one game and you always need to use your brain if you take the game seriously

aside from that i like the game alot, and the game is very enjoyable. especially with friends
(quick note. i have only played this civ as of posting this review)

final verdic. 7/10
"
26371,amazing game
26372,"Overall a great game that you have to play for just one more turn until you realize its morning. It has a few minor issues though that annoy me.
The first is how the combat animation for certain units can be stuck in a loop for way to long but that can be solved by simply selecting ""quick battle"" and skip the animation completelly.
The second and more important is how some unique units maintain their special traits when upgraded but others lose them. For example the chinese Chu ko nu maintains the double attack when upgraded to gatling and later machine gun and the same goes for the english longbow that maintains its +1 range when upgraded, but other units (like the byzantine cataphracts and dromon ships) lose their unique traits and become generic units when upgraded. There may be a mod that adresses this but i'm too lazy to look for it. If it exists and you find it, use it."
26373,fun to build and waring
26374,Fuck you Rosewelt
26375,just one more turn
26376,"This is hands down the best version of the Civilization (including the expansion packs). Beyond Earth is decent enough, and VI is GOD AWFUL. I have logged countless hours into Civ V and plan on logging countless more. Please aim for Civ VII to be more like this and less like a mobile phone game!"
26377,"You'll play it for hours. I dunno what else there is to say really. Very moddable and relatively mod friendly, so you can have / use modded civs pretty easily."
26378,love it
26379,Yes
26380,It a fun game with unique theme on playing
26381,Yes.
26382,The best Civilization ever. :-)
26383,"something something ghandi something something 2008 reddit cringe

But actually this game is just solid 4X at its best."
26384,Just...one....more...turn
26385,Great game if you want to suddenly lose 12 hours of your life when you open it.
26386,One of my all time favorite games. Easily the best entry in the Civ series
26387,Really good so long as you have many many many many hours on your hands
26388,one more round.................
26389,ebic
26390,There is enough diversity in the game play that it can be different and exciting each time you play.
26391,"Take time to learn how to play, but it is really an addicted game"
26392,it gud
26393,"i am a fan of Strategy games and my go to game is Civilization V. It is an old game (2010), however the game has so many ways to alter the challenges to win the game. There is different maps, difficulty levels, mods, goals to win and other game altering items that has kept the game fresh. There is also the large Civilization fan base that has helpful discussion groups. I have been a Civilization fan since Civilization I and Civil V has been my favorite one."
26394,"Had hundreds of hours of fun, just from the base game. So much more fun with friends or family as well!"
26395,"AS long as I can get this to run on Catalina... This is one of my favorite games I've ever owned. With over 400 hours in, I hope to continue playing this game for years to come."
26396,Makes you feel like you are part of something more.
26397,good game to kill an hour or two
26398,Love this game if you like strategy games this game will consume your life
26399,Love this series.  Kiss hours of your life away with this most excellent game.
26400,yeah mofucka!
26401,play this game if you like CBT
26402,gud gam
26403,"Of all the games I possess the one that I have played most is Civilisation V.  Over time, (15497 hours I am told,) of all the games I have played of Civ 5, I have never won (and never lost) a single game, mainly because i enjoy everything  about the game until the later stages when things happen that mar the enjoyment which results in me becoming annoyed to such an extent that I decide to start a fresh, unmarred game. What happens is that all the houses and buildings vanish leaving roads and cities only, the way to try to correct this is to reload, again and again, until, either the graphics load correctly or I delete the save and try a previous save, if no luck, I start a fresh game and play until eventually corruption sets in and the foregoing happens again - and i can start enjoying the game again!. I have never played a free game and my computer is top range,  that is, until the next improvement arrives. Overall, despite the above problem I really enjoy playing Civ 5, nearly all other games arrive, are usually enjoyed, then go! Civ 5, though flawed, remains a firm favourite. All is well, even if it don't end well. Brian Johnson   
"
26404,gud
26405,Good old fashioned game.
26406,Best strategy game I played and still playing.
26407,classic
26408,Great way to kill a few hours or a whole day. One of the best turned based strategy games of all time.
26409,"havent been into video games in a long time, but this game brought it back for me"
26410,Its a game
26411,Just great and realistic compared to other civ games
26412,It's just fun.
26413,"This game is amazing. The ultimate ""Just one more turn and then oops it's 3am"" game."
26414,"The expansions bring this game from good to great. I ""one more turn""ed myself all the way to 2,000 hours, and I'll gladly spend 2,000 more. Civ VI is approaching V in quality with its own expansions, but I don't believe it will ever replace it for me. One of my favorite games I've ever played, one to stand the test of time."
26415,I like to nuke the world as India.
26416,This game is extremely addictive and you truly can't stop playing it. I don't play it that regularly but when I do it's in 12 hour periods seeing each game through to the end. If you have something to do later in the day don't start playing civ you'll look up at the time and realize it's two in the morning.
26417,"There is just so much to do in this game, especially with the dlc."
26418,it's good and I like it
26419,cool
26420,188 hours and never won a single game on prince difficulty. 10/10
26421,its fun
26422,"good game, i like the stratigic aspect
"
26423,Absolute waste of time
26424,Great game
26425,best game ever
26426,"It's just wonderful ! And the realistic aspect of the terrain only adds to the experience ! Just the exploration of new worlds each time, some can be a bit annoying.
C'étions absolument superbe, la beauté des paysages, la complexité des relations, découvertes, recherches etc."
26427,"Meh on it's own, great with DLC + mods"
26428,"Fun strategy game, good way to while away a couple of hours."
26429,Amazing game impossible to grow tired
26430,good game
26431,Bullshit
26432,"Well... This game is legendary nothing I can say will do it justice 8/10 without 'brave new world' xpac and 11/10 with. Although the base game is great it well and truly isn't worth playing without brave new world it's like having a reservation at that really nice fancy restaurant in your town but you for whatever reason got a hot-dog on your way home from work... you're still going to the restaurant but you've every so slightly diminished the experience. 

get brave new world on sale for $7 (here or steam keys elsewhere it's always $7) 

if you're wondering ""what about the first xpac gods and kings?"" let me clear it up for you in the simplest way: 

The new mechanics and features introduced in gods and kings is all apart of brave new world. Everything. The only thing you get in gods and kings is 10 new civs besides that everything is in brave new world and its first that reason you should pick it up AFTER if you enjoy the game. But trust me don't waste any time without bnw it's that good it takes a great game into the stratosphere to the point of requirement."
26433,"It's fun, I guess."
26434,"Like Civ6 but old, more consistent and cheaper. Need all the DLC. Very fun!"
26435,Hundo foh sho epic
26436,It's fun. Get it when its on sale. also nukes. and mods. cool thx bye

It's A'ight."
26438,Just due it.
26439,GOOD
26440,"Civilization V is the best turn-based strategy game I have played, even after the release of Civ 6."
26441,"Peak of the civ seiries, be careful you'll sink loads of time into it"
26442,Very fun game to play alone or with friends
26443,"I spent almost 16 hours and almost 500 turns on a game with my friends.
One of them threw the game to an AI because my other friend built a wonder he was working on.
I didn't even get pee pee poo poo to be a world religion.

I'm not gonna play it anymore, but that doesn't mean you shouldn't"
26444,nice
26445,yes
26446,Shit game!
26447,Solid!
26448,"Arguably the best SM Civilization iteration - straightforward, less complex than Civ VI, but far more enjoyable"
26449,Great 4x strategy.
26450,It's a very good game. Highlight addicting if you know how to play.
26451,its a amazing game
26452,yes
26453,Very fun
26454,fun
26455,my favorite of the Civilization games and i think i have all of them
26456,"Fun.
"
26457,I've been a devoted lover of the Civilization franchise for almost thirty years.  I've played Civ V for several years and consider it the best so far; enough so that I feel no need to try CIv VI.
26458,"addictive af and a great time sink
"
26459,I've always enjoyed the Civilization games and Civ 5 captures all the best mechanics from all the previous games.
26460,"A fun game if you like turn based strategy and history. while it is not historically accurate, the information you can learn about managing a society, being a world leader and its complexities."
26461,yes
26462,Much better than civ 6
26463,Its hella good fam
26464,"Vanilla version not a patch on BTS, but final version grows on you and becomes the thief of time that all Civ games are."
26465,"It took a little while to adapt from CIV IV, but it was definitely worth it."
26466,"classic turn based strategy world builder, top of the line"
26467,g
26468,Addicting game. There's a lot of mechanics to discover and mods to try out. Found it to be better than Civ 6.
26469,Disabling cross platform multiplayer was a stupid move and defeats the purpose for me.
26470,"Kept quitting.

Edit: I didn't change to Direct X 11 during startup."
26471,"welcome to BIRD UP!!!!!!!!!??????????////////////////////!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! 

THE WORST SHOW ON TELEVISION!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!11"
26472,"This game is a lot of fun. It has multiple starting points and really allows you to carve your own way in history, starting right at the beginning."
26473,Good
26474,I LIKED THE CHARACTERS AND THE FEATURES EVERYTHING DID NOT LIKE THE DELAYED SOLDIER RESPONCE
26475,good
26476,We've come a long way since pottery.....
26477,"Few games have so entranced me to the point of completely losing track of the time. For someone who isn't generally a fan of turn-based strategy, I've managed to really get into the deep strategic gameplay found within this game. The sheer variety of civilizations, maps, and methods of victory provided to you begets incredible replay value, only further enhanced by the hundreds upon hundreds of mods created by the community. Well worth the pick-up!"
26478,i love this game
26479,best game hands down. 2020
26480,one of the best games i every played in the genre.... must have
26481,Good stuff lol
26482,"Crashes... Dont waste your money

Updated... Crashes constantly. Dont waste your money"
26483,NICE
26484,W
26485,"It's not perfect by any definition. Unfair spawns, pretty narrow progression, and buggy online multiplayer are things that you will deal with. BUT, I adore this game. I have had so much fun playing skirmishes with the AI, as well as many LAN parties with people to play together in a long sitting. I would highly recommend the expansions as well, as they add much-needed balances and features to the gameplay."
26486,ez
26487,its good
26488,I like it
26489,10 Years later and full expansion Civ V is still the best way to experience Civilization
26490,It`s great fun!!! why don`t you buy now? buy it! It so good!!!!!
26491,I like to build worlds and explore.
26492,it a good game
26493,Its overall a very good game
26494,"A true masterpiece. Having played for 5+ years (originally on another platform). The only (obvious) shortcomings are overly simplified diplomacy and frustrating AIs.

I do get tired frequently of this game, but each time I return, it's amazingly refreshing."
26495,.
26496,"awesome
"
26497,"this game great, I love this game"
26498,very fun and addictive.
26499,Fun game to blow off steam. My son plays it with me. I do the politics and let him fight the wars.
26500,"Hate your life?
Do the hotel desk graveyard shift?
Just have 37 hours to kill?
Get Civ V."
26501,Banging
26502,great solo or with friends!
26503,"I would recommend buying this over the latest game, fab graphics and can (and have) ploughed many hours into it."
26504,great game
26505,"Something for when you wanna be a Roman. Or Asian. Or French. Or Indian. Or...
A game for gentlemen and gangsters alike. 
4/5, enchanting and teaching."
26506,Just don't drive after playing it all night like someone I know.
26507,fun
26508,Great game!
26509,very addicting
26510,hours of fun
26511,very informative game. have enjoyed it for over 6000 hours.
26512,The best version...
26513,"Absolutely love this game. So much replayability with the base game alone, not including expansions. Add them in, plus the Workshop items, you'll be playing for years to come."
26514,"Played for a bit, it's aight...I guess."
26515,it's good
26516,e
26517,yesss...........
26518,"After putting a few hundred hours into Civ VI, I've uninstalled it and started playing V again. This game is perfection and the community has made some really amazing content to extend and improve it even further. This is, to date, the definitive Civilization experience."
26519,trash game
26520,Realism.
26521,Still better than the 6
26522,"a good time waster game, very nice"
26523,It's alright if you got it on sale. You can mod it to play however you want. I personally really enjoy going up against very hard AI since they make it interesting.
26524,"Better than sex and civ 6
"
26525,Great Strategy Game with multiple variations & scenarios to keep interest. Not over-complicated as its next edition Civilization VI. For strategy lovers that dislike over-active games (like shooting and killing all the time).
26526,great game
26527,nice
26528,This is a marvelous game – it's a lot of fun both in singleplayer and mutliplayer. But be warned it can be a massive timesink. ;)
26529,hgj
26530,Number 2.  I Love this game.  So many different achievements. So deep.
26531,"You need the DLC's otherwise its a crappy game, but with all DLC's ans Add On's its propably one of the best, maybe the best, 4X Game i played so far"
26532,Still amazing. Great game.
26533,"A highly addictive game u have been warned.. time evaporates  fast . before u know it, its been ten hours  of clicking muttering one more next turn"
26534,Amazing and addictive game. Truly my favorite.
26535,"Civ 5 is bar far one of the best ones ever made, it's great to just log in a casually play."
26536,good
26537,"Fantastic game. You'll find yourself saying ""Just one more turn"" as it hits 3:00AM."
26538,"Imagine, if Hitler had dropped an atomic bomb on Berlin, as the Allies closed in around the beleaguered city. In one last act of defiant spite, he tried to kill as many of his enemies and his own people as possible. Now replace Hitler with Ghandi and Berlin with Dehli and that's about 90% of my games playing against India."
26539,Good game I guess
26540,Yes
26541,the only game i know where one more turn can take 8 hours or more
26542,08=ijui5gf313rf5g5hhy534t
26543,good for marathon sessions. if you have 18 hours to kill this is your game
26544,"This is my favorite game of all time. I think the mechanics are the game are great, it looks beautiful and just epitomizes everything I love about strategy games."
26545,This is a fantastic game. I would give it a 10/10. I have played too many hours in Civ V...
26546,its ok
26547,It's ok i Guess.
26548,good
26549,"This is my favorite 4X game of all time. Yes, I've tried 6, and this is still better. I've tried so, so, so many 4X games. Many I loved, but none more than Civ5.

There are mods that make the game even better, and provide even more replayability."
26550,really tickled my pickle
26551,Fun
26552,Better than civ 6
26553,"Before I get into the core part of this review, I want to advise on 2 things:

1. This game is epic, will take some time to figure out, but is absolutely worth it (yes, even in 2020)
2. DON'T stress about the Scenario/s (or lack thereof)... the juicy fun is in Settings Up your own custom games! (achievement hunting too :P )

---

Time to break it down like a clown! *throws banana cream pie*

Most of what you learn about the game is; find nice resources, build around and develop them, save up / trade up, do science and culture stuff, maybe religion things too, make friends or enemies, then duke it out - by tactful sneaky subterfuge, or all-out war to the finish!

A lot of the types of strategies and AI personalities seem fairly realistic (within reason) if you contemplate them a bit, and the combat strategies fairly well scaled depending on difficulty rating. Beware the ""friends"" who covet your riches or lands! :P

A game of intrigue, building, strategy, and conniving - hours of fun, in a million different scenarios!

Don't miss out on Civ 5, it might be ""old"" but it's gold. (Legacy game, definitely worth it - whether you have a discount for it or not)"
26554,"My first game on Steam. Had a lot of fun playing with friends, even though waiting for the other player to finish can be difficult."
26555,"It's pretty good, I've honestly got a problem with it. Like my girlfriend knows that if I am late for anything it is because I am playing CIV. I have actually forgotten to eat for a whole day because of this game. Please download at your own risk."
26556,"Amazing game with hours and hours of replayablity. There is so much content available and I can wholly reccommend, especially with the moddeing scene in full steam"
26557,"I've played every civ game leading up to V, and it is my favorite of the group."
26558,Phenomenal game.
26559,"Epic game, complex and enjoyable. All politics should be trained on this game prior to take positions."
26560,Great Game but be ready to lose 3 hours or more and have no idea where it went.
26561,"Please get this game its actually really epic gamer, you should get the dlcs too."
26562,Its ok
26563,"Very good strategy, will play a lot."
26564,its got india guy i liek nkue man
26565,can sit for hours playin so make sure your not fat or you will become twice as fat
26566,totaly recomended!!!
26567,Hell yeah mother fucker
26568,"Great Game, with very flexible gameplay and enormous replayability :)"
26569,is good gam
26570,Great game. Absolutely addictive.
26571,if you dont own this game buy it i mean jesus its civ and the best civ ever made many fun times with friends or solo ive had sessions of this game last 90 hours or mp games lastings months fuck the new one its trash 5 is the true god
26572,Civ will remain a classic..always a thumbs up
26573,Absolutely must have strategy game. I am a veteran of many different strategy games and this by far is the best TBS I own.
26574,civ 5 is still better than civ 6
26575,Doesnt get old
26576,Always a classic - I still return to this (and some earlier) version when I want a break from Civ6
26577,"cool
"
26578,"Civilization makes me uncivilized

5/5"
26579,Fun for the family until someone hits Atomic Era.
26580,good game
26581,good enuf
26582,best civ ever!!!
26583,"It's a good vanilla game, but with mods you can make it a GREAT game.

I've tried everything from ""Europe only"" to realistic world to World of Warcraft themed and etc.!
One of the best RTS's I've played"
26584,"While I only have a few hours logged in on this account, I used to play an obscene amount of Civ. 5 on my dad's account back in the day. This is a good game in and out. However I am not the most well versed in any of the other Civilization games so I don't know how it pairs with the rest of them nor do I know the competetive side of the game [i] I only really play single player or hot seat with family and friends [i] . But coming from a casual perspective this is a great game."
26585,"Have played this game for well over 100 hours and i keep getting back to it. Have not played all the games in the series and haven´t really even touched CIV 6. Really recommend playing either alone or definitely with friends. it makes for a good time for sure

8/10"
26586,I very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very like this game
26587,"Very good game. Lots of customization in the maps and a wide variety of interesting characters and nations to play as. MY only complaint is that there is no way to stop era progression without mods, because I feel like I play an entire game just hoping to get cannons, and once I have them they're already obsolete within 10 turns. But, other than that, great game with great gameplay."
26588,"Its fun, game engine is garbage though"
26589,addicting
26590,"It's a good game and all, but it's so slow paced that a single round will take multiple days to complete on average, at least for me.
I don't have much experience in multiplayer, but of what I have with it, (playing with a single friend) it hasn't been very good, I recommend singleplayer."
26591,good play nice grafics
26592,"Civ V is a clean addition to the Civilization. Its easy and user friendly HUD, the attractive graphics, and large diversity make Civ V one of if not the best in the franchise. Whether you are a veteran to the genre or just getting into turn-based strategy this is one of the largest staples of the genre."
26593,"The king of all civ games, civ 5 is by far one of the greatest games I have ever played. Everything is balanced well, with a way to manage each facet from economics to religion to the military successfully. The difficulty scaling ensures a challenging game regardless of personal skill level. The DLCs make a good game great, and I heavily recommend all of them."
26594,"Best Civ game so far. I haven't given Civ 6 it's just play through, but I doubt it could beat Civ 5."
26595,Good game
26596,There's only one way to play.
26597,"[h1]***WARNING IF YOU PLAN TO PLAY WITH FRIENDS***[/h1]

First, this game is great. Very few complaints other than knuckledragging AI.

However, be warned if you plan to play with friends: this game currently cannot be played* between Mac/Linux and PC users. Here are a few threads that explain:
https://www.reddit.com/r/civ/comments/dwhpcw/civ_v_version_mismatch_error/
https://steamcommunity.com/app/8930/discussions/1/1661194916748974393/?ctp=5
https://www.reddit.com/r/civ/comments/dwuse3/aspyr_civilization_v_mac_steam_has_received_a/

tl;dr Apple went big diva and banned 32 bit apps from running on Mac OS forever, so Aspyr (the Mac developer for Civ 5) did a lazy patch to make the game playable, but at the expense of being able to play with the PC version. As of now, it doesn't seem like they have any plans to fix this. Probably because it's old and they want to push people towards the much more profitable Civ '76. Oopsies, I meant Civ 6.

I only play this game to play with friends, so now that that's been taken away from me, I have no reason to touch this game. Will update this review to recommended if it gets fixed.


*There are some very convoluted work arounds that involve either emulators or downgrading OS that allegedly work if you have beefy enough hardware or don't mind wiping your computer clean, but for a normal person running up to date software on your laptop that you got for college in 2014, you can count on not being able to play this."
26598,Its very well done. Not to pink on the inside.

26600,Great game. Even better with DLC.
26601,Don't expect any technical support from the company though.

26604,"Best Civ game I have played so far, especially from the gameplay angle."
26605,"great gameplay,"
26606,this game is pretty good
26607,decent game
26608,"Like Civ 3 but a lot better. A very good progression and in my opinion, both with and without the massive DLC, better than Civ 6. This game is amazing. It says I played for 82 hours, but on a previous account I had when I was younger, I sunk so many hours into this game."
26609,Just a classic great game
26610,Love it!
26611,Better than civ 6
26612,Great game still fun even with CIV 6 out.

26627,"The multiplayer in this game is absolute GARBARGE. Sid Meiers, the old fuck, employed some fucking monkeys to write the synchronization code. It is absolutely IMPOSSIBLE to play the fucking multiplayer, save the fucking game, and then fucking load it again. I seen you in HELL, Firaxis Games!! 5 people spend their HALF DAY in this AMAZING game only to FLUSH THE SAVE GAME INTO THE SHITTER THE NEXT DAY because the game cannot resync itself when loading back!!

26635,good
26636,"I played Civ 1 through Civ 6. Huge fan of the series. I find myself going back and playing Civ 5 over Civ 6. While it isn't perfect, it's just so much more fun. One of the keys is they did a lot of re-thinking with Civ 5, it literally is a different game than when it first came out. So early reviews may not have liked the game, but I think they rounded out most of the mistakes in later patches. Totally worth buying and playing."
26637,ye

26650,"This is the game that you can play 1,000,000 times and spend all day on every playthrough. 10/10 would reccomend if you have that time and patience"
26651,"awesome
"
26652,"First and of utmost importance: DO NOT buy this game without also buying the DLC. It has become easier as the game ages to find everything discounted in a bundle, and there is every reason to get it all. Of all the studios that do this, Firaxis is the most consumed by this cancer. Everybody who knows, knows: Playing Civ V without the major DLCs is like playing half the game. You don't get some of the most critical systems and currencies in the game, and your more discerning friends will not play multiplayer with you.

That small bit aside, as a completed set Civ V is one of my favorite games. Once you have the full package, it is truly a full package experience. This is a Big Game. For once a 4X game actually feels like AAA material, with graphics that still hold up, culture-specific voice acting, and an accessible-while-still-deep tech tree. It's a beautiful accumulative take on the 4X genre and the Civilization franchise, and if Sid Meier was around today he would probably be proud to put his name in the title.

V is a bit of a departure from the series gameplay wise. I think the main complaint (aside from being unfinished at launch) is that it dumbs down a lot of stuff from the earlier games in order to be accessible to a wider audience, and that may be so, but there are still enough micromanagement choices and optimizations in this game for there to be a real dividing line between people who are good at Civ V and people who don't know what they're doing.

Also of course the AI could use a bit of work. Deals and relations with other nations feel superficial.

26744,incredible
26745,Very addicting
26746,I love this game! So so good. It says i have played it for 91 hours but thats like 3 games on medium - large maps. You start with a single town and few units and then you research and dominate and trade and be the one. Shame game ends at year 2050 but the journey is so worth it...just one more turn

26759,"IS VERY NICE
:)"
26760,"Civ V was an unexpected improvement over Civ IV, notably the switch to hexagon mapping and the prohibition against unit stacking.  I played Civ IV to death, because it was awesome, but it suffered from tremendous computer slowdowns when bloated stacks of units attacked each other, so the more chess-like V turned out to be a nice surprise.  The art in Civ V is also gorgeous, especially the leaders.  The religion system in Civ V is also much more interesting than in Civ IV.  Civ VI, sadly, while introducing some interesting features (like the map search function and religious warfare), just isn't as fun for me to play as V, and it's ugly to look at, especially after being spoiled by V.  The terrain in VI isn't as pretty as in V.  The leaders are Macy's parade balloon dufuses.  I've given Civ VI a good try, but I always go running back to Civ V.  It's complex enough to keep my attention, but simple enough that I can reasonably play it on a touchscreen/keyboard laptop.  If VII is ever made, I hope that it brings back some of the grace of V."
26761,best Civ game since CIV 2.
26762,Lots of fun
26763,"Good game, the addition of religion adds a new twist.  Diplomacy needs to considered else you end up on the wrong end of a 2 or 3 on 1."

All while I'm across the country now with no way of getting the game back. Talk about a total downer, a reason not to play."
26824,Perhaps the best game ever made.
26825,Murdered a general in Iran and got away with it.  10/10 would play again.
26826,I've played this game well beyond 213 hours it's the best Civ game they've made so far with all the expansion packs.
26827,one more turn...
26828,"I've played this game both casually and hardcore. Half of my time is spent offline in a cabin, so basically double or triple the time I have on record when considering this. 

This is by and large one of if not the best strategy games of all time. The intricacies and complexity of the factions/countries coupled with the incredibly varied scientific, religious, militant, and economic based victories make this game an absolute must for anyone who enjoys strategy games. 

Furthermore, if you like to base your purchases based off of value and playtime, this game is easily one of the most replayable and enjoyable games I've ever experienced. I can honestly say that no matter the price you pay for this game, you can be assured it is worth it."

26859,The game is a timeless classic. I've spent hundreds of hours playing this alongside my father after it came out and the DLC content only furthers my enjoyment in the series. With the innovations they've made from the previous game and the lessons they learned in this one and sent onward to Civ VI provides enough evidence to me that this game is well worth the money spent on it.

26869,"DO NOT PLAY IF YOU WISH TO HAVE A SUCCESSFUL AND DIVERSIFIED LIFE. This game is addicting in its approachable complexity, attention to detail, and rewarding gameplay."
26870,The replayabilty is awesome. Best of the series.
26871, nukes are a weapon of peace
26872,+1
26873,"It can be very addictive. I always found it hard to close the game. Bit challenging for newcomers like me.

pro:

lovely graphics
music
many ways to win
Easy enough to learn
Just one more turn

negative:
ai seems too ready to declare war - might be the way I play but the Celts really hate me.
game really lags late game -  never saw that beforew now but since I play on my own now it really lags. Maybe Nvidia driver bug?
Slow to load. Even on  my desktop Intel 8700 it took forever to get to main menu. I use an ssd hardrive and 2 very good cards. I have nvidia 1660ti and it took over 10 minutes to get to main menu.
Best played with friends who can help teach you to play."
26874,"I am not good at this game, but it is fun as hell and the strategy aspect of it is amazing. 10/10"
26875,my friend forced me to play this
26876,"Honestly the best game i've ever played. Good gameplay, good graphics (doesn't really matter that much), and over all I love it that you easily use mods with it."
26877,"one of the best civilization installments for sure, particularly when coupled with its many expansions. It solved many of the gameplay issues of the earlier installments (the stack of doom eg), and still stands up to civ6. I would say that civ5 is better than its successor in many ways, yet is also worse in some (i personally enjoy the added strategy of districting). either way, this is a classic civ game, and you can run it on an old macbook(!). although the graphics are aging (and it is missing some vanilla elements of civ4--random events eg), it will definitely remain an enjoyable and relevant strategy game for some time."
26878,really enjoy this game
26879,This is an on going match of your use of skill of play and hours of on going event to make you think your way through each gaming session.
26880,"What to say, its an incredibly detailed, fun, long lasting game. A masterpiece."
26881,"Wanted to nuke a Civ that everyone hated, accidentally nuked all my allies too and began a war with the rest of the world, would recommend 10/10"
26882,"I put a lot of hours into Civ 5, Like 3 games worth or something like that. I really enjoy this game and have fond memories of it. I would argue that now that Civ 6 has the Gathering Storm expansion it is finally better than Civ 5, but in it's initial release and subsequent expansions Civ 5 was one of the best turn based strategy games, beaten only in my mind by X-Com: Enemy Unknown, but in reality they are far different games except for the turn based aspect. If you feel like picking up Civ 5 even with Civ 6 out I do recommend all of the core expansions as they greatly improve the game in my opinion. The music is great, the graphics are solid, the gameplay is by far the strongest trait, and the civilization design is unique and fun. Overall a great game, I will miss it but Civ 6 calls to me.

9/10"
26883,Meh it's alright ig.
26884,Love it

26886,Perfectly balanced.

26890,"If you have the time it is so fun although if you come back to a save after a while it can be weird and difficult but once you get over that its great.
really good game if your in for long hours of tactics and complex allies/ wars."

26892,Didn't expect to rack up 100 hours. Every game is an immersive story.
26893,:)
26894,"incredible game
"
26895,Much fun over 100hrs played although only played one game
26896,This is one of the best games of all time. This is easily in my top 10 favorite games. Its a great strategy game for beginners and everyone.
26897,"i like this game but i dont like going to war when i play with my friends i say no wars cause im a little bitch and my name is also August , this game is a 9 / 10, looks kinda trash compared to civ 6 but thats expected i like the look personally but cant please everyone im only writing this review to help a fellow out so they can decide if they should buy the game. Jk im writing this cause the game is downloading and steam asked me to do this, so now im just killing time. ... RIP those who died to the hands of Iran thought real talk, but i guess killing some general was what was needed, its like trump saw 6 underground and said we should kill a general."
26898,it good but me like fallout new vegas
26899,"Great game, lots of cool mechanics for a strategy game. The history in it is great too!"
26900,Interesting educational materials. Great strategy game.
26901,Great game. Lots of thoughtful strategy involved.

26905,"yes
"
26906,"To Me: Mr. Washington? What happened to Sweden?

Me: I ate it."
26907,Awesome game with all the DLC's
26908,Great game.  Builds on the history of the original Civilization.  I like the options to create a world that interests me.
26909,"gud game
"
26910,"Super game, I actually prefer the graphic of Civ-5 over the newer Civ-6. however, newbies will like Civ-6 as a starting point!"
26911,Just plain fun no matter how many hours you play.
26912,"Extremely addictive. It's a marathon of a game though so can't recommend starting late at night if you have to be up for work the next morning. Since, you'll stay up way too late to play games instead."
26913,"50 hours in, i have yet to complete a full game"
26914,"Good game, it keeps your interest and is interesting."
26915,Great way to kill 5-10 hours at a time.
26916,This game has kept my little group of gamer buddies playing even though most of us are now married and some of us have kids.
26917,good
26918,"The game is fun and obviously its got to be good if people here have 40k+ hours in it. But the one thing that I always hated in this game is the win conditions. You got a war victory, which means you have to take over every other civ. That means your going to spend 200 turns moving your troops across jungles, oceans, and hills. Your oonga boonga spearman will reach the other civ by the time they have reached the moon. Overall, the domination victory is very boring if playing on any reasonably sized map. So then you have science, which never made sense to me, because if you are that far ahead in science, and somehow have not been shit on by the other players, you might as well hog all the uranium and bomb them since they can't see it yet. Then you have diplomatic victories, aka watch your trade routes for 100 turns and make gold then bribe all the city states. Lastly you have cultural victories, which nobody understands and for good reason, because its boring af. The game is addictive and great but once you know you have already won, there is no point in even continuing unless you want to watch some animations and get a victory message. This is the biggest flaw in this game in my opinion. If you ever play tic-tac-toe and do the trick where you know you win, imagine that but instead of being one X away from winning, it's 200 turns of clicking. It's a problem that is rooted into the game design itself that would require a new system in place, but as we see with Civ 6, they somehow made that game worse by ignoring this gameplay loophole and focusing on global warming and rng golden eras. In conclusion, this game is okay, Civ 4 is better, don't play 6."
26919,"Easy to learn, hard to master!"
26920,"good stuff
"
26921,Look at the hours played. That is all.
26922,its great
26923,Probably one of the best strategy games I have ever played. The Steam workshop mods really make the game come to life. I think this one is better then the newer Civ 6. Definitely not a waste of your money.
26924,"I've been playing primarily Real Time Strategies (RTS) since I was introduced to Starcraft 1 when I was 13 years old. I've played over 10,000 hours across all of the RTS's I've played, from Starcraft to Age of Empires to Command and Conquer to Warcraft 3 and now to Civ 5, among others. That being my experience, this is the best turn based strategy game I've ever played. It's a reasonably grand scale, but not unmasterable, and therefore not deterring for that reason. I'd say one with strategy experience could get to a reasonably high level with 40-80 hours of play time, which will make them competitive but will also leave lots of room for fine tuning strategy to keep interst. I consider it far better than both Civ 4 and Civ 6. I consider this the second best strategy game I've ever played after Starcraft 2, and the best game on Steam."
26925,Enough variants to keep coming back for another playthrough.
26926,great game to play
26927,brilliant
26928,good to play with your only friend
26929,"Big Game, much timesink!"
26930,This is maybe the best Civilization in the entire series (and I've played them since the very first title). It has everything we love in TBTS. Must play.
26931,"Good game.
Lots of replayability.
Better with friends."
26932,Great Game

26942,"Civilization is a great strategy game. It is not historically accurate, which allows it to work as a good strategic sounding board. You almost never face the exact same diplomatic or military problem twice, which forces you to think of ever new and different solutions."
26943,it fun
26944,"pretty good

26971,"Saw how many hours I have spent on this game and figured, ""Eh, I ought to recommend it."" If you're reading this review in 2020 and haven't played this game yet, I don't think I can help you. Great game. Apparently good enough to sink 1000 hours into."
26972,Before game I was small brain but now I am large brain because I play strategy game

26974,"Probably the best price to hours of play time out of any game I own.
Buy the DLC for sure."

26989,It's working again. Thank Nep
26990,"As someone who've played all Civ games there is, I can only say, that Civ 5 is the best Civ game there is."
26991,For some reason the game no longer starts.
26992,A modern classic and worthy heir to the Civ franchise. Lots of DLC available as well as two expansions. Maybe I'll clock 1000 hours before tiring of this - who knows? :)
26993,Great game very replayable

27000,"I have been denounced by a big breasted anime girl in a swimsuit for watching anime with English subtitles instead of learning Japanese.

I gave Jer*salem to my vassa- ehm wife Holo the Sage Wolf as a present.

Some alien named Tharaxus took over the Soviet Union which I later liberated and conquered both the alien and the soviet union.

P*lestine and Isr*el became friends.

I have been given the title of ""The bloodthirsty one"" by A*olf H*tler himself.

27065,pretty epic with mates
27066,cool
27067,Love playing multiplayer and trying different ways to win a victory.
27068,"Civ 5 is a very fun and exciting game. For the most part with the exemption of a few civs the game mainly depends on your spawning location and ability to use your surrounding terrain/resources to dominate the world. However as you progress and log on more hours the one MAIN issue this game has becomes more and more apparent. The host gets a SEVERE advantage over all other players. If played on simultaneous, which drastically speeds up the longevity of the game the host because of the way the game loads in will always be able to move his pieces before others. Allowing the host to attack then move out of dangers harm before his opponent may even have a chance to react. The other advantage the host gets which is even more substantial comes in the form of wonders. If two civs are going to finish a wonder on the same turn, which happens way more than you imagine the host always wins and his is finished while the opponent loses out and wastes precious building time. To further test this me and my 4 very competitive friends played  10 games each taking turns switching out as the host. 5/10 of the games the player hosting won. If the hosting advantage was fixed by the devs this would be a even more awesome game."
27069,Civilization V is a great game. Still play it because in my opinion its better than VI.
27070,"This game can leach hours out of your life. I had it before on disc and bought it to play with friends. Still one of the best, if not the best, turn-based strategy  games i have played."
27071,Always fun to play!
27072,"It's a good game, but honestly only reviewing to stop it from asking me to again. Definitely worth wasting multiple weeks of your life doing nothing but staring at this damn blue screen while you forget to eat, shave, or take care of yourself. 
I frequently use this game to get myself back into a feeling of self worth. All that I have to do is start a civ and by the time I'm well into the technological era I have wasted away to the point that the only thing that seems interesting to me is actually being a productive member of society again. 
10/10 would recommend this game to friends as long as I'm alright not seeing or hearing from them for the forceable future while they forage in the realm of civilization v."
27073,one of the best game ever!!!
27074,gg
27075,"This is one of those timeless games (with all DLC) that you can pick up, play for a bit at any point and then just forget about for a while. It will be waiting for you whenever you come back. Great way to spend several hours."
27076,I know its not as many as other people have but 152 hours in game currently should explain enough.
27077,i like
27078,It's definitely better than Civ 6.
27079,No support of multiplayer between Mac and Win
27080,"A classic, but the AI is meh"
27081,Fun game. Build your own empire and strive. Very challenging.

27085,Best of the series

27099,fun and interesting!
27100,Civ 5 is a great addition to the series if you are able to get both expansion packs. You'll find yourself playing deep into the early hours of the morning with this game and not realize it.
27101,"I have played this game as a stress reliever for years. When I was extremely depressed, it was a reason to get up in the morning. When I went back to college, it was a way to decompress after my brain melted from homework. When I got boring, low-paying jobs that had nothing to do with my brand new college degree, it was a free thing to do to cheer me up. Now I have a job I love and a happy marriage and some real good brain pills for the depression, and this game is going to be a thing I do to pass some time cheerfully on a Saturday. This game has been a good friend to me. Thanks."

This is my favourite PC game."

27162,"Very fun game. May be a little old, and the graphics aren't the best, but this is still a very fun game to play. It is very different from Civ 6, but still really good. I am a little spilt on which one is better"
27163,This is a time-machine
27164,its fun : )
27165,Good strategy game with the right balance of war fare
27166,I like the aggressive strategy involved in playing domination mode.  AI is far superior to Civ6 (they will plan war and attacks not limited to the start of game) :)
27167,Fun but games can be very long
27168,Its aight
27169,I like that every time I play the game I am challenged.  I can change the settings and make many different scenarios for myself to enjoy.
27170,lul
27171,it was very good that it
27172,This was the best civ.
27173,"It's a really fun game, though it can get boring after awhile if you don't add mods in.  Modding is super simple though so with that in mind i certainly recommend it!"

27188,Civ 5 is one of the best strategy game I have played! I'm new to Civ series but was playing War Craft and Space Craft for a while. This new design and complexity have made me enjoyed the degree of possibility!
27189,People always say that you can't buy friendship. WHO'S LAUGHING NOW. 12/10

27193,issa good game
27194,"Great game. Tons of mods and community content. I find it relaxing to sit and play this with my wife in the evening. Also, who says computer games can't be educational?! Tons of little tidbits of history and culture scattered all through the game."
27195,Very fun. Even better with mods.
27196,Friends are shit to play with one always rushes great lib while the other rushes food the builds big navy and anal fucks your coastal cities as you get fucked by the AI who just got paid to declare war on you by the first guy whos done fuck all the entitre game
27197,Way better than the 6th one.
27198,Good Game
27199,"So much fun!!!! Hours of getting boned by stronger civilizations then right when you think you're about to catch a break.... boom, your allies turn on you!!!"
27200,good
27201,good
27202,"Great game, every new game is literally a new game. A must have for strategy game lovers. Turn based, so enough time to consider your next best move. I personally like to play the game with not too many opponents so I have 'room' to develop a strong empire early in the game. Anyway, play it like you like it best and just have fun."
27203,"One of my all-time favourites, a classic game that will steal your life away. Kinda expensive for a game that's a few years old like this, and with the DLC can be a bit much. So get it during a steam sale and enjoy its seemingly endless content."
27204,good
27205,Not bad
27206,good ole game simply put.
27207,Civ 5 is awesome!
27208,Love this game. I also highly recommend vox populi mod (community patch) as it completely changes the AI and makes it more challenging.
27209,Good game.
27210,Wonderful game with countless ways of ruining friendships with nukes.
27211,fun
27212,Civilization V does not need reviews. C'mon...
27213,Love it. Can't get enough of it.

27218,Great strategy game
27219,civ>sea
27220,"The game is great imho, one of the best around.   Civ 5 is very sleek and polished and a joy to play.  There is so much to explore, things to do.  Resource management, diplomacy, city expansion and much more.  

Many games these days have extensive game mechanics you must learn.  Setting up your key bindings then learning the mechanics is often a chore.  Then there is muscle memory.  Knowing what key to press is only half the battle, you still must be quick about it because you are on the clock as the AI acts.  That’s all fine and good if you spend a lot of time in a game and know game mechanics like the back of your hand (literally).   But what if you just have a few hours to kill and haven’t played the game in a while?  You need to refresh yourself on extensive game mechanics before you dive in.  Not so with Civ.  

It’s one of the few games where the entire game is played with just the left mouse click.  It’s turn-based so you have time to think about what you are doing before the AI acts.  It’s perfect for those of us who have a life outside of gaming and can’t spend 10 hours a day sitting in front of a computer.   Plus, its progressive so that I can shelve the game for weeks or months then sit down for an hour or two and pick right up where I left off.  No extensive game mechanics, just select, click and go.

Regarding negative reviews on crashes and bugs, launcher broken, etc.  I can’t speak to that because I have enough horsepower in my rig such that I don’t have any of those problems.  Also, a lot of negative comments on multiplayer.  I play single player, so I haven’t seen any of these problems either.   

There a lot of Civ versions out there.  Before I purchased, I did a little research and found very positive reviews on this version.  Civ 6 is available and I would be tempted to buy it, buy I feel I barely scratched the surface on Civ 5, so I’ll stick with this version for the foreseeable future.

27223,just fun
27224,"good , but take toooo many time"
27225,very good.
27226,IT WAS GREAT
27227,Time consuming
27228,"This game can be two things, sometimes at the same time. You can run your empire, relax and listen to the calming music, and just bring peace and happiness to your people while working on advancements for your civilization along with the help of AI's. Or you can start an all out war and destroy other countries and take them as your own. Or both."
27229,"more than civ VI, a lot of hero from every countries so i like this game"
27230,literally one of my top 3 fav games <3
27231,One of the best game
27232,"Just a great tactical game. As a fan of Civilization, who started playing from Alpha Centauri I can say that this is the best game is series. Civ 6 is worse, better take Civ 5 instead."
27233,"it good. i forgot to eat and sleep, but it fun.
"
27234,good game yes
27235,The most time-stealing game ever

27243,Its cool I guess
27244,Fun
27245,Best Civ to date. 100% worth all the time you will dedicate to it
27246,Great turn based game. Multiplayer is fun with friends but with random people it can take a long time. This game takes some time to get used to.
27247,"Prefer this over Civ 6. AI in civ 5 is weird, but it's even weirder in civ 6.
Lot of good times. You're probably fine with the base version. I enjoyed the DLC but didn't feel any of it revolutionized the game."
27248,this game is for when you just came of an acid trip and you are bored as fuck so you tell your friends that youll invade them as genghis khan and at the same time youre baked as fucked and have the munchies so you wait for your friends to redownload the game for the 30th time while you cook egg rolls in your shitty KitchenAid microwave in your pajama pants and greasy hair cause you havent seen people besides your parents in 20 days.
27249,it gud
27250,game good
27251,yes
27252,India + Nuke = One Nation Under Gandhi.

27254,Amazing game. Highly recommend
27255,Great game.
27256,"A Standard for turn based players
"
27257,"Great game, easy to lose yourself for hours"
27258,really rough linux port. do not recommend. NVM IT FIXED ITSELF
27259,Awesome game inspired by real figures and places of history that gives endless hours of fun and challenges!
27260,"Very cool to play with friends that have the mental patience for it. It's very similar like Risk where if you play with a group of people there's so much cool conspiracies, politics and teaming up and pacts going on. Each game will also be different if you play against other people especially and that keeps it great."

27268,Still the best Civilization ever made

27278,"A well crafted Semi-historical mesh of Sim City and Turn Based strategy. Conquer the world (Faster then the other guy hopefully) or trick everyone into loving your blue jeans and art. Choices in how to play range from being the bully that takes what they want to tower defence, but with cities. Either way put on some coffee and hope you can out smart or out pace your neighbor before they get jet plans.

Don't know who anyone is or why all roads lead to rome? The Game comes with it's own wiki you can check while the AI takes another ten minutes on how to move the fifty some odd zulu warrior around the map. Have fun!"
27279,"Fun
"
27280,"Like the rest of the Civilization series, totally addictive, and loads of fun.  Been playing this game series since the '90s."
27281,I like playing at my own pace and on my own. This game gives ample opportuniry for both.
27282,"Tried the VI, never finished a game. I've been playing since CIV2 and liked all of them but the sixth. I stick with CIV V for now."
27283,Been playing the Civilization series since it's first release. Must've spent hunderds of hours shifting those unit tiles around back then. Played every new release since and still love the game.
27284,Solid replayability. gets boring in late game tho. Still fun
27285,Start the game at like noon. youll finish and itll be midnight.
27286,with windows 10 it keeps aborting (stops running) and kicks me out of the game.  not much new to report.  Not sure this game and my PC are compatiable
27287,"Game was good fun. navy is strung. fuck Spain
"
27288,"i love this sh*t so much - if you aint played this by 2020 what are you doing?!
"
27289,Amazing game really fun esecially with dlc
27290,ahhh yes
27291,"MMM \

27292,"Fantastic game, likely the best of the Civilization Series"
27293,hype
27294,Fantastic game
27295,"Probably one of my top games ever. 
The replayability is great with many different countries to play as, dlc's are very much recommended.
"
27296,"A very, very addictive turn-based grand strategy game. Control your civilization from the very dawn of civilization, all the way into the modern day. You start out, depending on your settings, with a single settler unit whom can found a town. Once a town is founded, you are given the chance to begin evolving your people from the ancient stone-tossers into the less ancient pottery makers.  You gain a set amount of resources per turn, such as gold and science. You can use gold to purchase upgrades or units, but gold is better to be saved up until later in the game. If you gain minus gold, your people will be unhappy, and if you eventually fall into debt due to your economy getting hit harder than the Great Depression, you'll be in for a wild ride. So, in summary, keep your gold above plus. 

Science in turn helps your people evolve and learn new technologies. What a technology does depends on which one you research, as an example: In the early game you can research pottery, which lets you make culture buildings. With culture, you can evolve your civilization's policies, which determines what kind of civilization you will be leading further down the road. Unlocking one technology unlocks other technologies. You can see what technologies are required to unlock a specific technology by having a look at the technology tree.

Oh boy, I went on a tangent. Well...

TL;DR: The game is addictive with a lot of depth and fun things to do. Lead your civilization, become the greatest there ever was, and try to resist clicking the ""next turn"" button at 3 AM in the morning. You're way past bedtime."
27297,"Always fun to play. Never get tired of it 
"
27298,Best Game to play with some Friends. Just all around great experience.
27299,Gocko say: Game good
27300,A fun game that doesnt require constant attention during singleplayer
27301,"My Favorite Game. 

All of the best parts of a complicated board game without spending the majority of it filling in damage calculations. Pure (easy to learn, hard to master) Strategy.

Whether you play solo, or with friends, anyone can find 100s of hours of fun here.

Many Civs to pick from, tons of maps and scenarios, and a STILL active modding community make this game alive and well. 

TBF Civ 4 has a deeper diplomacy and civics system along with larger more expansive mods. Civ 5 has better movement (via hex tiles), a better UI, and is much friendlier to newbies. 

What are you waiting for? It's like $10 complete on sale!"
27302,"I haven't played Civ 6, however I can guarantee you will have fun playing this. Single or multi player."
27303,"Keep going back to this game. It's such a time sink, but I love it."
27304,Very good game. Lots of replayability.
27305,Nice chilling game. Recommend it.

27314,pretty good
27315,"It's a nice strategy game, but should be more automatic. It gets really annoying to order units to go from 1 place to another each turn. Big maps are really hard because the tie it takes to do this every turn. Then waiting for players to make their move takes more."
27316,I played it 15/0
27317,"GREAT strategy game. Depth, style of gameplay."
27318,Yes
27319,"It's a nice game, it's civ."
27320,Best Civ ever!!

27340,Watermelon head
27341,Look at my hours in this game.
27342,"This is one of the worst Civ incarnations. It seems that with each new release, graphics and interface get better, but the gameplay gets less intricate. I suppose they have to make the game appeal to a wider audience, so a lot of things (city management, the civopedia) get dumbed down. 

It's still addictive though. I've sworn I'd stop playing at least 7 or 8 times. A large map will EASILY kill an entire day or more. Once you get the hang of it, one playthrough is a lot like the next. Yet here I am, a few years and a LOT of play hours later, working through the achievements for each leader, like a dumbass. But if you're free/sick/snowed in and you have to kill a day or three at a time, this game is OK."
27343,"Amazing game.  I prefer to use the robot and take my time, thus this one is a game for your mind, not your hands. There are many rules which take months to absorb, but that's the beauty of it. With so many things going on, so many dimensions of competition, you can accomplish your goals in many ways. Once you get good at Civ 5, it becomes art. This is the only game I play because it is always a challenge, and the local situation never repeats. Sid Meier is truly my hero."
27344,One of the best game purchases I've ever made. Still better than Civ VI which I gave up after it lacked the perfection of this game
27345,In my opinion still the best version of CIV :)

27359,Its too long but still a great game
27360,"This is easily the best strategy game ever made. While there is a learning curve, once you overcome it, this game has endless replay-ability."
27361,best round based strategy. I am not very much of a gamer but that game made me kind of addicted. Highly recommended
27362,I wasted my life in high school playing this. I cant recommend this game more.
27363,"Is nice. Might get stale after some time, mostly because the bots are stupid as shit and the only way to make them stronger is giving them stupid advantages that make the game less fun for you aswell."
27364,I like expanding onto other territories and using units to block paths.
27365,I enjoy the irony of playing as Germany and going for a cultural victory. 10/10 would recommend.

Undeniably the best of the best when you include the expansions.
Worth every penny you invest.
This game is on  point and is the culmination of everything that was good about its predecessors.
DO NOT BUY CIV 6 - brutal game by comparison"
27376,"its a very good round based strategy game, very well done"
27377,"Bought the base game, then expanded to all the DLC. never regretted it. Absolutely one of the best games on steam. if you like turn based strategy games, it's the only game you'll ever need. Multiple types of victory, so you can win by turtling up and boosting your science, by completing quests for & bribing city-states for diplomacy, make great works and send out archeologists for tourism, or crush your enemies under your boot for domination. Just remember one thing before launching into your first game: there are no friends in civ, just practical alliances."
27378,"Realized today that 935 hours in. i never dropped a nuke til now. This game realy brings out your peaceful side. Would recomend
"
27379,civ good
27380,"if you like investing hours of fun with friends in multiplayer mode this bug riddled garbage is not for you, its fun on its own and great in small game modes, but the second you choose any bigger it enjoys soft locking itself halfway through the game"

27382,super advanced risk where players have mulitple ways of winning
27383,empire state of mind
27384,"I've played this game for over 770 hours and with all of the DLC, the game completely shatters Civ. 6 out of the water. The game is way more fun and simpler than Civ. 6 and the DLC provides a excellent experience."
27385,The classic 4x strategy game. Could not recommend this more!

27412,"Became Supreme Emperor of Japan. Built up a massive navy. Started exploring the world, meeting all of my fellow leaders. Started building a bigger navy. George Washington was my strongest trade partner. He was the first to fall. Norway denounced my destruction of America. Norway didn't stand a chance. I am the last player on the board now, and as I gaze out on the wasteland I have created, I am finally at peace.
Jokes aside I highly recommend this game, it's tons of fun and is something I consistently return to. The only things stopping me from playing this was that after 30 hours in a single game I had too many units to control without spending an obscene amount of time moving them all. So do I recommend this game? Yes, very much so. I haven't played much of Civ 6, but I enjoyed this more. Now back to conquest"

cons: interaction with other empires is way too simple and repetitive.

27419,"It's Civilization.  You either love these games, or don't.  

If you have *never* played ANY Civ or 4X game, then start with Civ 5.  Easily the best in terms of ease of play, complexity, and graphics.

27442,Great game! It is a little bit annoying though that the AI takes quite a long time for each turn in the late game. The game is even better when using a mod that forbids the production of robots (late game unit) such that it is more 'realistic' in that sense.
27443,"Good game.  Don't wanna write a long review cuz I wanna get back to playing.  It's not super expensive so give it a shot, you know?"
27444,Nuke everyone
27445,Hours of fun with the mates
27446,Civ 5 is by far the best in the series.
27447,"Great piece of art, get cultured while gaming."
27448,The game has aged a bit since its release. But the mechanics and gameplay are just as fantastic now as they have always been. I'd 100% recommend this game to anyone looking for a fantastic way to spend a few hours (or more!)
27449,its good
27450,Amazing game
27451,The availability of new modding materials.
27452,Just great!

27461,Fun game with lots of replayability

27471,"Overall great game, but some bug has made it so Ihaven't been able to save a game for a solid month. Now mac updated and once again it no longer is able to play at all."
27472,Still on turn 1
27473,Best turn-based game I've ever played. Better than the sixth in my opinion
27474,I am not going to describe what civ is...
27475,Its a great game and fun to play with friends. Complicated to begin with but become better as you learn how to play.
27476,This Game is Civ V.
27477,excellent requiring strategy and finding the strengths of your leader
27478,"THE STRATS, THE PLAYS!"
27479,"I really enjoy this game, it's a pity they have moved away from this form to CIV 6,  which I find is to IA biased."

27489,Fun and addictive addition to the Civilization franchise.
27490,it good
27491,"Fun. But CPU Intensive for a mac, my 2017 air is a bit overwhelmed."
27492,"Wonderfull Game to Just chill and spend many hours on

And don´t forget about nukes, these are always a plus
Realy nice game experience"

27495,"Original Review:

An awesome game made better by all the DLC/Expansions. If you like Civ you will love Civ V. I got it on sale with all the DLC and it became one of my favorite games rather quickly. If you have played it without the expansions and DLC please pick them up. They improve the gameplay immensely. I have over 500 hours in it and feel like I easily have 500 more to go before I am tired of it. Highly recommend, one of the few 10/10 games I have played in 3 decades of gaming.

April 2020 Edit:

It seems this game has issues working on Windows 10 and has had consistent crashes. If it were just me having these issues I would leave my review as is but a quick google search will show you that others have the same issues. I have tried to verify the game files and each time it says 3 files are incorrect and it re-downloads them and each time they are still incorrect. I will have to reconsider buying Fireaxis games in the future as they seem to not care about the multitude of people with similar issues. 

TLDR: An amazing game ruined by constant crashes."
27496,Very great for someone that wants to not see the sun in years. PS it has great mods and combat.

27510,this game is better than Civ 6
27511,"350 hours of play time, I think I like it lol"
27512,Excellent strategy game. I can sit down and play it for an entire day. Very dangerous for free time.
27513,slaps.
27514,Awesome
27515,is gud
27516,This is one of my favorite games of all time. The replayability is endless and with mods can be even more challenging. Try and get the full bundle on sale and its a remarkable value.
27517,One of the best 4X games of this generation.
27518,ez as fuck boyyyy
27519,sick game init
27520,I enjoy this game as more a multiplayer game to play with my family. The different styles of playing along with the different paths to victory keep the game interesting. One issue I have with the game is that it is pretty clear who will halfway through the game. Some one else could pull ahead but the odds are very low.
27521,"Me Japanese, me do what I want. Fun times."
27522,Great gameplay with many different facets of your empire to manage. A good upgrade on the other CIV games.
27523,its good
27524,Not played much but seems like a great game :D
27525,fun game
27526,Awesome
27527,2600 hours and still playing regularly...can't say that about any other game.
27528,"Good game if your ping is bad. Make sure you take out the annoying China girl ASAP, she is a cunt and is super annoying."
27529,The game has so many different concepts. Each game you play is different and unique. I have played the Civ series since Civ 2 and this version is the best I have played so far.
27530,AoW
27531,If turn based strategy games are your thing I'd highly recommend this game
27532,Its fun
27533,Awesome!
27534,It's one of the best games from the Civilization series.
27535,"Very easy to play and easy option selection, I like the policy tree and also the recommended options to take from the different advisers. Very well put together.  Nothing to dislike about this game at all, in my opinion I think its better than its newer game civilisation 6."
27536,Great fun for any kind of player!
27537,amazing game.
27538,best game ever.....
27539,"the only memory I really have of this game is my friend saying ""i don't have time to play civ5"" he then proceeded to sit up till 5 am playing multiplayer piano.

Civ is fun doe."
27540,"I played it a lot, there are a lot of different path to consider and how you play is really up to you. From micromanaging your cities to amassing hordes of troops the game is fun. I found the culture pathways to be very immersive. After years of playing I finally won while playing on deity and it was an awesome feeling. There are so many strategies to play and have fun with. One complaint I do have is that in order to win at high level play there are certain paths you have to take otherwise you will get beat down. If you want to learn a ton about world history through a video game that lets you form a communist American regime then this is the game for you!"
27541,Plenty of fun for hours. So many different choices to keep the game fresh after several games.
27542,gay people should die
27543,endless playability and my favorite strategy game
27544,"I mean yeah 
"
27545,You can select the level and number of opponents you play against from one to eleven!
27546,Would you be interested in a trade agreement with England?
27547,it's good but idk why
27548,"This game is excellent. I have played for over 1,000 hours now and no game is ever the same twice."
27549,"Sure I have a term paper due in a few hours, but how much could one more turn really hurt?"
27550,A great pastime with friends or alone.
27551,one word review:nice

27557,"If you enjoyed the other Civ games, you will like this one too."
27558,"Been a fan of this franchise since the beginning - in my opinion, every expansion added something to the previous version...except for one; VI. V just plays smoother and gives you a better feeling of what's going  on - again, just my opinion."

27560,"Sick strat man. Just don't neglect Ghandi, or Bismarck, or even Iroquois."
27561,16 thousand hours so far.
27562,Excellent once the expansions came out.
27563,"If you're as lucky as me this game is slowly going to kill you game after game of which you get your capital 90% tundra, and 10% will be a river with plains around it. Now I understand playing Russia, I should expect tundra, but then I tried playing Songhai, who have a bias to stay the fuck away from tundra, and I still get that damned spawn. If I haven't lost my mind yet I'll casually scout my enemy to find out he's practically got like 6 lake victorias in his capital alone. Its like my people are allergic to food and they try to jump into the damn ocean to hunt seabears."

27571,Another Good game to kill a few hours.
27572,"This is very much a similar experience to its predecessors, but with better graphics. Interested in seeing what Civ 6 is like."
27573,"Quality game, can't get enough of it, can be replayed over and over and still be engaging. Has a brilliant modding community that adds an extra element. Fully recommend this, totally worth the money.
Have fun."
27574,Its a game you play for fun
27575,yeah it's fun i guess
27576,It's a lot of fun. :)
27577,The strategic element
27578,Civilization 5 is a good beginning and casual strategy game. It is not very CPU intensive when compared to grand strategy games which makes it good for weaker computers. Its basic rules make it great for getting into strategy based games but are dynamic enough to allow for replayability.
27579,"10/10 

Would send nukes all over the globe again"

27584,Great game.  Not much more to say.
27585,Its fun Just be carefull of the voice in ur head that says just one more turn.
27586,"9 years I play both single and multi player and never lost my interest of the game. In a few days, I will enter a ten years anniversary of this fantastic opus. Much more interesting than Civ VI in many ways ;) The only minus is that Firaxis/Aspyr never delivered a SDK for Mac players/moders ( neither in Civ 6 ) :/ sooo unfortunately ! But Civ V is a great great game :)"
27587,It's amazing
27588,"Sid Meier's Civilization V is one of the most elegantly designed, stimulating strategy games to date. Play through the ages as some of earth's mightiest leaders, such as George Washington of America or Catherine the Great of Russia. You can customize your experience with ease, selecting from a wide range of unique maps, characters, and settings. Battle other empires for superiority and propel your civilization into the future...Will you stand victoriously above the rest or fall to ruin as history runs its course?"
27589,A classic time waster of epic proportions.  I've yet to become bored with the game due to the replayability.
27590,Why is everyone better then me
27591,the mods are where it gets to be a bit better
27592,all my civ games stopped working and tech support is not a lot of help
27593,"This is a great strategy with handsome, ADULT graphics, not cartooned characters. Very educational if you are interested in the growth of civilization in our world"
27594,meh
27595,"I'd played Sid Meier's Civilization 2, 3, 4, and 5 (this game)  with and without all the expansions. I 'd played even Civilization Call to power. This one is the best, no doubt about it. A must for Civ fans."
27596,"I finally managed to find some time to write a review for this game because I was too busy playing it.

27610,Perfect if you're a controlling autist like me.

27612,"The kind of game you can come back to every now and then until you die.

The one thing that would have take off a point from the score is that the unit routing is so bad. Send two units so that their paths intersect, and they will just block each other and get stuck. Also, even now I still run into annoying bugs that ruin the gameplay."
27613,This and Alpha Centauri are still the quintessential 4X games
27614,!
27615,I'm still a big fan of the original Civ 1 but v5 is pretty good as well.
27616,"10/10
The game will drain life out of you but you're gonna like it. If you've got just a couple of time don't even start 'cause you'll come to yourself after 10 hours just to grab some food, visit the toilet and then quickly return to your empire."
27617,My favorite civ game so far. Some DLC are a little buggy but it doesn't ruin the experience. 9.2/10

I play casually with myself and friends.
Lots of options, little bit of a learning curve but you can learn to play quickly.
Great to have installed and just load up when you wanna sit back for hours one night and jam out.

27655,Top 5 game all time for me. All time classic.
27656,Oh man oh man do I love this game. I have grown up playing video games and this one I think is the best. Even better its old and affordable. Dont need a powerful PC either. I have gotten so much out of this game.
27657,"i have played around 1400 hours and it has been by far the most entertaining game i have ever played, i mean culture science religion?! everything, the world wonders' illustration, the quotes... my god. I have already recommended it to several people and i will keep doing that. 

If anyone is reading this, you should go and buy the board game ""7Wonders"", 2011 best game and many other awards. It is just impressive and somewhat very much like Civilization V. 

I love you guys, thank you for everything.
My most sincere regards from Santiago, Chile, Southamerica."

27663,"I am a sucker for these turn-based strategy games, but this one trumps many I have played.    It can be a time-eater to be certain, but the successful completion (and even sometimes utter failure)  of the various scenarios makes it a very fun play."

27673,Fun game that takes a long time to learn!
27674,"I like the game mechanics. Every Civ you choose has a little different way of winning. You can try to play each campaign as a carbon copy, but you'll find it easier if you discover the unique advantages of the each Civ. 
Highly recommended, especially for playing with friends.
My only real negative is that some units have way more power than they should. For example, I get a little irritated when WWII infantry wreaks havoc on my WWI landships. Rifles didn't get THAT powerful in a generation, but that's just a personal problem, not a game killer."
27675,Yes.
27676,"unlike many paradox games (i.e crusader kings 2), you need to own every DLC that the host is playing with. i have no interest in this game outside of playing it with friends, and I'm not buying $100 worth of DLC to do that."

27688,its still a fun game to play and in comparison to civ 6 it has few to no bugs.
27689,if you consider another civ game other than this you're mentally retarded and need to go see a doctor or you're just so pathetic you're a 67 year old virgin in their parents basement who's first kiss was the computer screen while playing one of the 15 hentai games they own.

Very fun and addictive game that remains fun to this day. Better than civilization beyond earth and not too far behind civilization 6. This is a great game for laptops with poor graphics card quality, runs at 60fps on integrated intel uhd 620 graphics. If you can run/afford civilization 6, however, I would totally recommend that game."
27725,"The Civilization games are my favorite and this one has become the top one! I have played these games so much, I am in love with the strategy that comes into play."

27737,"Still a good game to play, you'll lose hours of your life ""one more turn"" I haven't played the newest version yet, but probably will shortly. If you like these types of games (turn based), This is a classic, it's still reasonably popular for a almost 10 year old game. Which tells you a lot in a way. The newest one that came out a few years ago, is just now beginning to pass it in popularity."

27739,i like
27740,My favorite game of the decade.

27743,"Say good bye to your time and play CIV! This was my first civilization game and I enjoy it a lot. It's easy to start without prior knowledge and playing it is really nice :) Build cities, occupy other cities and defend your own civilization"
27744,I enjoy this version more than VI.
27745,its fun
27746,I think I would. Yes.
27747,Great game
27748,Civ is one of the classics when it comes to strategy games. Civ 5 specifically is one of the best versions if not the best out there now.
27749,This is the best version of the Civilization Franchise.  I have played every version  and this one is the best and my favorite.   Civ VI broke the chain of better versions IMHO.
27750,"As always, super fun. Love playing with my friends and taking over the world slowly because no one understands that we just want to be peaceful people, why do they keep attacking us FINE WE'RE GOING TO FIGHT BACK THEN. NO. YOU DON'T GET PEACE. YOU GET WAR. YOU WANTED THIS."
27751,great game with the Addons
27752,A true classic strategy game. Will have you playing until 5 am without even realizing it. Can't recommend it enough!
27753,"As you can see, I have played this game for 550 hours at this point of time. I am a big fan of the Civ-Series and Civ 5 with its expansions is THE BEST Civilization in the series imho. 

Civ 6 is overdeveloped and the AI can`t handle the new city district concept nor the tactical combat. Diplomacy is a mess too. 

Both games look similar game mechanics wise, but in Civ5 the systems do work and they 100% deliver the ON MORE TURN addiction. 

I strongly recommend to play Civ5 with the Vox Populi mod (community patch) as it improves the AI and balancing. 

If you plan to play Civilization go with Civilization 5 and not 6."
27754,one of the best game
27755,nice
27756,"The best Civ game. The perfect mix of simplicity and complexity. Not as tedious as Civ VI, and actually much more visually pleasing in my opinion. the basics are easy enough for new players to pick up, while the nuances can continue to challenge the more experienced players."
27757,Lil MC Nukes never hurt no one baby
27758,cool game
27759,"Fire
edit: Zzzzzz"
27760,addictive gameplay with many variations.
27761,Fun strategy game for any and all to play
27762,Have played over 5000 hours and still love the Game. One of my 10 best .
27763,Best strategy game!
27764,amazing
27765,is good
27766,Very good game - you can waste a lot of time in it
27767,As all the civ games good system and game play.
27768,very cool game
27769,one of the best games of all time
27770,nice game
27771,Love it
27772,.
27773,"It is very great game, I have had (at the time of writing) over 600 hours of pure joy playing this game. It may be old now but it still is great."
27774,"Overall great game to play with close friends, or people you want to get to know better. Games are long, and can be played in multiple or single sessions, and you will learn a lot about eachother whilst playing."
27775,game just gives me a reason to hate indians
27776,game good
27777,My childhood game
27778,Great strategy game to learn on. Just watch out for Ghandi...
27779,perfectus
27780,very gud
27781,"Haven't played much, but for my first game, I had 10 days to prepare for war and spent that entire time building animal pens.

Entire city was destroyed, game over. Not sure what else I expected.

Good game though."
27782,This game will keep you glued to the screen for an entire life
27783,A classic turn-based game. The best of of the Civilization series.
27784,Brilliant game would recommend to anyone
27785,better than civ 6
27786,"Best turn-based strategy ever. Well ballanced, well tuned, high re-playability. Great fun!"
27787,its bad xD
27788,"I grew up playing colonization, nothing has ever quite brought back that nostalgia, but the civ series comes pretty close.  i usually play the game and win through military victory, so I enjoy building up my roads and railways around my major cities and then strategically taking major capitals and using those are drop points for my next attack. ive got 200+ hours in, so I think the purchase has been worth it. I will continue to explore and possibly purchase other civ series games."
27789,I've put s little time into it...
27790,"Mmhmm. Play, I do. Very good, this game is. Rate it 10/10, I do."
27791,gud game
27792,"Endless entertainment
"
27793,Have played this game for many fun hours. will do so for many more. My wife and daughter now play this game as well.
27794,The best Civ game of all time.
27795,very nice
27796,gud
27797,No more stacks of doom
27798,"Civ 5 is really good , it has great replayability with(out) mods , the workshop is huge full of mods and theres always new ones that are being made , better than civ 6 the graphics look nice, not very buggy ,however Buy the complete game with all the dlc , its necessary for most multiplayer games and it has key features that really enhance the game get the full thing when its on sale for 10 euros or less  ,"
27799,I love everything.
27800,A great installment in the Civ franchise.
27801,"Remains very playable after 700+ hours.
Cant play Civ 6..."
27802,"you don't have a job?? you don't go to school? this game is for you.
you just keep playing and playing with different nations until you played them all.
"
27803,its good
27804,fun
27805,"This game is intricate, satisfying, rewarding and so much fun
"
27806,Just finished my first game.
27807,The ultimate Civ game.
27808,"This is a significantly stronger game than they originally released. It stands as my favourite Civ in the series, of which I have played them all up to this title, including the non Sid Meir associated tiles. Very good."
27809,"good stuff, buying the DLCs right now cause of the winter sale, something i should have done long ago"
27810,"-Purchased yesterday
-Check stats after a couple of games
-Time played = 24 hours

27815,"Civilization V is one of the greatest strategy games ever to bless this nuclear-wasteland of a post-Gandhi Earth. It goes on flash sales all the time where you can get the base game+ all the dlc for 12 bucks. If you can spare 12 dollars I would highly recommend this game to everyone-- even if you've never played a civ game before or don't particularly like strategies. This game is easy to understand, and with time anybody can be the best. I would also recommend the Civilization Battle Royale series on reddit and youtube."
27816,Fantastic Strategy game. Addicting.  Interesting.
27817,"uyummmm
"
27818,Awesome game. Nothing like getting lost in a new world to explore and conquer. Fun.
27819,yes
27820,This is my favorite game ever. Definitely recommend the Gods and Kings and Brave New World expansions for the ultimate Civ experience. 10/10 would play perpetually until dead.
27821,benis
27822,its got replayability
27823,hi
27824,Fun game. I played Civ Rev a lot on the xbox 360 a long time ago and the game has certainly progressed for the better since then. Definite buy. High replayability
27825,great game real easy to play
27826,"Can murder your friends, pretty neat"
27827,"Very fun and has a lot of choice when it comes to how YOU want to play, better than civ 6."
27828,"Extremely well balanced, complete and beautiful game. Very easy to understand and enjoy, the must have of strategy.
10/10"
27829,"Great
"
27830,"awesome game, need alot of time investment to learn the mechanics of the game, but once learned lets you put so much time into it for alot of fun and replayability"
27831,"The biggest problem(?) with this game is that each game tends to play out in a pretty similar way. That doesn't prevent me from enjoying the process every time though. Because the tech tree is immutable, it's pretty rare to be able to deviate from the ""best"" path and still be effective, but using the different strengths and bonuses of each civilization to synergize with that path is almost endlessly interesting. The expansion packs added features (faith, tourism, etc.) that help differentiate somewhat between strategies, so having both DLCs is a big plus. Strategy games are consistently one of my strongest genres (maybe after FPS) so maybe I'm biased, but I find this to be a great game."
27832,I like the variety Civ V brings to my thinking.
27833,you lose track of time because this game is fucking fun.
27834,"Incredibly good game and worth every penny.

I'm not a good Civ player, but I definitely enjoy the different difficulty settings and if you have all the DLCs then every game against a new opponent will feel like a new game.  Once you get bored of the DLC you can add mods and just start all over again!  By far my favorite has been the larger cities giving you a radius of 5 instead of 3.

I have enjoyed this more than XCom and other highly rated games."
27835,"gud
"
27836,"I play Civ on random (as you should) because I enjoy being forced to play the game a certain way.  Somehow I always seem to get militaristic civs.  10 out of 10, would conquer the world again."
27837,Good modding community.
27838,As great as ever
27839,"fantastic game. lots of fun, high learning curve."
27840,it is realy easy to learn and it is fun!!!
27841,amazing seriesd
27842,Its Ok
27843,it's okay
27844,"well, I've spent literally all of most of my school breaks for the past 3 years on this. I'm not sure how, it never feels like I've spent that long on it. It's very easy to get sucked into 9 hours of ""next turn""""next turn""""next turn""""I'll go to bed after this turn.""""fuck, I forgot I agreed to invade Carthage. I guess 10 turns more.""""next turn.""""Next turn.""...."
27845,im crying why did ghandi nuke me
27846,"Just fun, fun, fun. Stay with the odd number Civs..."
27847,"Exploration, wide range of choices and decisions  with cumulative consequences."
27848,"It's fun, especially with friends. Get it if you like strategy, it's a blast."
27849,Fun and thought provoking :)
27850,amazing
27851,It's alright I guess
27852,Decent game.
27853,"I play civ since civ II. I have above 200 hrs on record for Civilizaiton V. I ussually play in standard sized map with 8 civilizations on emperor level. The game is really epic and challenging. The best turn-based strategy of all games. Recommended for all turn-based strategy fans. The game is very well graphically designed and has well thought, broad feature list."
27854,"THIS GAME IS AMAZING IF YOU'RE INTO STRAT' GAMES,"
27855,
27856,Can't stop playing it!
27857,Good Game
27858,"Strategic and fun with multiplayer
"
27859,"""just one more turn"" more like ""just one more game"""
27860,Fun
27861,This game still holds up as a great one.
27862,"Great Game that still holds up to this day
"
27863,y
27864,.
27865,My favorite Civ game I have had them all
27866,good game.
27867,Goodest game. Simple.
27868,"V is the best version of them all - I've played them all from the first civ on, when it was a new game."
27869,Fun
27870,Just. One. More. Turn.
27871,Civ 5 is great and really fun with friends!
27872,"Cant complain, really fun game, especially with the DLCs"
27873,nice strategy game i enjoy playing
27874,Yes very good game indeed
27875,"its good
"
27876,venice is the best civ in the game and ngl its pretty fun it has its flaws when you compare it to civ iv but really id reccomend it to peolpe
27877,"I set up my first game, clicked start, next thing I knew, my wife took the kids and divorced me. 11/10 would recommend."
27878,"Slow paced, like all Civilisation, it's best to avoid multiplayer. You always have one braindead player in the game, that uses so much playtime, you forgot what you wanted to do in your next turn, eventually you get distracted, so you even forget you're  playing a game. Just a horrible experience in MP. Do it, if you like to play for six hours, whilst effective 5 hours waiting for others, and playing one hour at peak.
Best played in singleplayer, so you can enjoy this game, whilst just waiting on the CPU Players.
"
27879,"Do it. Throw your money at it. Easily the best of the series.
While the scenarios may wear a little thin, randomly-generated campaigns (or those crafted to earn particular achievements) never seem to get old. AI difficulty has some hiccups (the ""jumps"" in AI ability can seem... drastic?), but unless you really feel the need to beat everything on Deity, it's hardly an issue. Shiny damn game."
27880,it good
27881,"I find myself coming back to this game from time to time. I like it! Easy enough for casual gaming, yet hard enough on other difficulties to strain your brain. Turn based play means I can pause easily and do other stuff, then get back to playing.
The only negative aspect I have towards Civ5 is that the AI is somewhat annoying and runs on what seems to be game-theory principles, without accounting for actual game-theory results. The AI will praise you on one round then backstab when convenient. To the games credit, though, this varies from civ to civ.

Overall, it is a good and fun, no stress game!"
27882,gud
27883,"I have been playing Civ for years, and I would definitely recommend this game to others!!!!  Just make sure you have the time....it is easy to get sucked in and forget you have other responsibilities!!!!"
27884,Much better than Civ VI. I bought Civ VI and within a week I was back to Civ V.
27885,Awesome!! Can't wait to play more!!!
27886,its just good end of story
27887,"It's a great time with friends. It's always fun to make best friends with other nations and bribe them to nuke your buddies
"
27888,yes.
27889,"Great game, unfortunately the 'load save game' bug causes it to crash to desktop after autosaves and renders it completely unplayable."
27890,"It's the best game 
"
27891,"It's Civ. Aside from Factorio, I think my friends and I have probably lost more hours to this game than most others combined. Extraordinarily fun with friends (although, plan ahead, games take a while to finish). Highly recommended."
27892,"I'VE PLAYED THIS GAME FOR 3200 HOURS?! 

Jesus fuck

"
27893,good
27894,Mods!!!
27895,It's a totally awesome game
27896,many hour but good still
27897,Its time consuming ín a good way
27898,This is a great game. Better than Civ 6
27899,:)
27900,Great strategy game
27901,In short one of the greatest strategy games of all time. Involves a hefty time commitment to maximize the enjoyment so it may not be for everyone.
27902,"I played this game with my friends for years. Even today, it is still my go to game for multiplayer when we don't know what else to play. Civ is definitely a great way to kill time as it is a long ass game with a lot of strategy involved. Each DLC is essentially an entirely new game as it unlocks such a ridiculous amount of change to the base game. Considering how cheap it is now, I would definitely recommend this to anyone who is looking for something fun to do over the winter break. My only complaint is that the most fun way to play is always domination as the other game modes just kind of happen on their own, especially cultural with the latest DLC. It doesn't feel like a victory when you just have the ""You won"" pop up randomly while plotting the destruction of another civilization, so I normally keep that option off. Diplomatic victories are pretty much based on how many city-states you ally with which boils down to who has the most money to buy the most friends. Time victories are good for shorter games, but then again, why play civ if you don't have that much time? Science victories are more fulfilling as they are something you actually can work toward, but at the end of the day, nothing is more satisfying in this game than watching a nuke fall on your enemies and hearing the screams of the civilians as their city becomes a nuclear wasteland. All in all, great game 5/5."
27903,"good strategy game, good for history buffs."
27904,gud gamee
27905,A great strategy game. A little hard to understand at first but a PC classic for sure.
27906,"go kill other civis
"
27907,"This game is amazing for bullying other countries and forces of power into your own will. MWAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAAAAAA


"
27908,best game in the world
27909,Great game.  easy to set to your level and every new game challenges you differently

27915,Gandhi
27916,Its a good stable engine that allows for game mods.
27917,waaayyyy better than civ 6
27918,Great grand strategy game that has hours of fun. Easy to play with no internet too
27919,it's fun
27920,"better tutorial pls thank you
"
27921,fun
27922,"not very historically accurate, but awesome"
27923,One of the best.
27924,Outclasses CIV VI in every way.
27925,GREAT GAME
27926,"On the one hand; Civ V is a highly addictive and fun game that, in my humble opinion, outperforms its successor in almost every way. On the other; it is so addictive, I spent an entire day on one game. For anyone trying to get into this type of turn-based strategy game, or the entire Civilization franchise in general, Civ V is probably the best choice. It includes many features that are both staples of the series, or were carried on to VI. Civilization V has become my favorite game of the genre, and I highly encourage you to try it out yourself. Though it is recommended that you pick up all the content DLC (Brave New Worlds and Gods and Kings) to make an already great strategy game that much better."
27927,"pros: very addictive
cons: too addictive"
27928,yes
27929,Really Good Game
27930,its lit
27931,"If you got time to kill this game rips, a game can last as long as you want it to"
27932,Good game
27933,"NOTE: This review applies to the full version of the game with all DLC>

This isn't so much as a strategy game as THE strategy game. 
Foreign policy? Yes.
Military strategy? In buckets.
Bribery and backstabbing? Of course.
Long term planning and strategy? Plenty.

I've sunk many hours into this game, and honestly there's nothing quite like it. If you are into strategy, tactics, history, warfare, chess, or anything similar, you need to play this game."
27934,Civ 4 > 5. Still adequate. Have yet to play Civ 6.
27935,Good enough to spend hours and hours without noticing
27936,"I've spent like... a lot of time in this game. If you like strategy games, this is one to pick up. Its systems may not be the most in-depth, its graphics may not be the prettiest, the AI might not be the best, but the game is a classic. As with any Civ game, you will spend hundreds of hours without even realizing it. The amount of civilizations to play, the starting conditions, maptypes, scenarios, victory types, and all of that will make sure that the game won't get old.

The game really shines in multiplayer. The amount of amazing and fun games that I've played with friends is astonishing, and this game is truly one that keeps on giving. Practically half of our in-jokes are from Civ 5 games we've played together. And ask anybody whose played Civ 5 and they can ramble for hours about tales from their past games.

If you're picking up Civ 5, get Brave New World and Gods & Kings. They complete the game, and make it truly worth playing. The other DLCs such as Civ or Scenario DLCs are really nice to have, but not really required. All in all, have fun with this gem!"
27937,Addictive
27938,it OK
27939,VERY GREAT GAME
27940,There's a reason the Civ franchise is the last bastion of the 4x game genre

27980,Infinite Possibilities
27981,"I must say, this is the only game in recent memory where i have personally been attacked by Ghandi as i, Hiawatha was taking a dump."
27982,Its ok i guess.
27983,Do you love history? Do you love strategy games? Sucks to suck but at least this game will be fun for you!

28024,"i love this game and i play it on a daily occasion i would also recommend playing SID MEIER'S CIVILIZATION VI

28025,I have liked Civilization since being introduced to it on Civilization4. The makers of these games have constantly improved the games as to include  some modern day United Nations functioning as would the actual institution. I recommend this to anyone

28031,"Civilization V is the best of the Civilization installments, imo. 860+ hrs of Civ V just on Steam, alone is my testimony. I'm not alone either. The seasoned Civ players are reaching for Civ V."
28032,Magical. The best ever.
28033,by far the best strategy and simulation game in one.
28034,Good Game
28035,"fun game a little on the long side though

28040,"Civilization at its finest. Now, years later it's still a perfect time killer when all you have is a 7 year old laptop. Go enjoy!"
28041,Best Game i Have ever played
28042,"The Best Civ series ever made, even thou not graphically advance from civ 6, but the game plot make unpredictable as the turn goes on......."
28043,"Yeah its good.

28048,"TOO GOOD, BUT TOOK TOO LONG TO BE THIS GOOD. 

Now it is worth all its price, I just hope Civ 6 is just as good one day, in a few years."
28049,Civ is a solid strategy game
28050,Prolly my favorite civ game of the series.  I recommend checking out if you never played.

28058,its just good
28059,its okay
28060,its great
28061,For the military minded people of the world it helps develop strategic planning and quick problem solving
28062,I almost forgot that I played all night until the sun rises and realized i've been playing the game 3 days straight inside my dark room.
28063,also yes
28064,"The best Civ game. Amazingly complex and developed without being too much. Every game you play takes a day, and it's worth every minute."
28065,very fun
28066,"I've played this for three and a half hours straight while my friend watched, ye its alright"
28067,good game

28077,this game kinda cool ngl
28078,my playtime is 950+ hours that should tell you something
28079,One more turn !
28080,Played this game quite a bit but then I updated the game and could no longer play with my friends that had PC's.... sucks that they took out the Pc and Mac compatible games. I wouldn't recommend this game anymore because of that. It would have gotten 10/10 but now its more 3/10 for me.
28081,Just loads of fun and lots of time wasted playing this game. <3
28082,"in summary, its the get bullied by everyone simulator"
28083,1
28084,"Civ 5 was an amazing, WAS until they separated Mac and PC crossplay in 2019. I cannot play with my friend (Mac) online anymore as they show entirely separate online and local game pages. I would have given this game a 10/10, now I just feel like some greedy executive somewhere made this decision and p*ssed me off = 4/10."
28085,"everyone declared war on me, i was just vibin"
28086,"great game i love it
"
28087,
28088,Favorite game ever. What else can I say?

28093,very entertain
28094,"Fun Game, lots of strategy."
28095,"mmmm venice has killed everybody with 1 city and 400 gold per turn

epic moment"
28096,Game is Cold and cool as a cukeumber.
28097,It's fun I got it and it's easy-ish to learn
28098,"No crossplay anymore between mac and PC, absolutely garbage, don't waste ur money on a developer that doesn't give a shit about the players"
28099,Civ 5 is the only reason I get out of bed and eat breakfast in the morning. The key to winning is to be constantly aggressive at all opportunities.
28100,.
28101,It's OK I guess
28102,it gud
28103,A great game for long-distance family and loved ones.
28104,This is my most played game on steam hands-down and for good reason. The only flaw with it is that it is a large game and that sometimes makes my laptop unhappy. But everything about this game is amazing.
28105,gandhi nuked me
28106,yes
28107,nice
28108,One of my favourite turn based games
28109,Great game but its a time vampire. I recommend.
28110,ghghghghghhhghghgghhghghghgh
28111,Good game
28112,Beter than six
28113,good
28114,"I honestly enjoyed the game, just a little time consuming."
28115,Civ 5 >
28116,"I keep coming back to this game....""Just one more turn.."""
28117,"a friend gift it so my dad could play it and he really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, likes it. 

This is his quote ""Addictive, fun."""
28118,Just couldn't stop it!!!
28119,great
28120,Shit game
28121,pp hard
28122,Better than CIV 6.
28123,No crossplay between Mac and PC. Bastards.
28124,eipc
28125,good game
28126,"Reasonable and simpler than civ 6
"
28127,very useful tool to use when you need something to permanently distract yourself from a to-do list
28128,"The variety and settings that allow players to customize game types add a unique aspect to every game. Civ 6 is probably great, but Civ 5 is just as nice!"
28129,Its aight too expensive tho
28130,basically good game
28131,Ehh
28132,good
28133,yes
28134,good!
28135,total awesome
28136,great game. enjoy losing hours of your life.
28137,Good
28138,its okay
28139,"Pros: fun, huge replay value, great strategy, decent AI
Cons: long campaigns (out of 80 hours, I have completed a little over two campaigns), sometimes certain AI behave in unrealistic ways
9/10 would recommend."
28140,One of my favorite videogames of all time!
28141,a fun time lasting game to play while wallowing in your own filth
28142,One of my favorite games. I actually preferred Civ 4 with the ability to stack armies but I had that on CD before I had a steam account.
28143,"Classic Civilization in its series (although Civ IV has its grandeur mod rfc). What's more, BNW dlc vivids it by ideologies clashing. Its weak point as post-industrial eras can be fixed and enriched by superpower mod and more. So I strongly recommend this game with adequate mods, to have a glimpse of humanity and development of civilization."
28144,"Very good . I'm a sucker for ""one more turn""
"
28145,fun with a difficultly to suit any player level
28146,"Decent game I play once in awile when I get bored with Crusader Kings 2 not worth the price and all the DLCS you have to buy tho. I waited until they were all on sale for around 30-40 dollars for all the DLCS for full price isn't worth it but sales come usually fast.
"
28147,Its much better than Civ 6.
28148,"love this game. get to be a civilization. dominate by military, science, diplomacy, and one other i forgot but cant wait to get civilization 6th"
28149,.
28150,Best game ever
28151,Great game.
28152,"If you enjoy starting a game at 4pm and ending it at 4am, this is the game for you."
28153,I mean I can take over the world as an american imperialist. FeelsGoodMan
28154,fun but i always get shit on by the coms because my brain is tiny
28155,"This is great vanilla however i prefer to play it with mods, it is much better than it's sequel Civ 6 and recommend this over it. I enjoy many hours of fun strategy and country building.  the only issue i do have is that the AI will always seem to chose the highest rated player as target for espionage and don't seem to use their spies against each other at all."
28156,yes
28157,xdfghjkl;
28158,Its wack
28159,"Would higly recommend it, its a timeless classic!"
28160,Funly addictive
28161,Great game!
28162,"Great classic, love it more than the others."
28163,uwu
28164,gud
28165,it good
28166,"This game is too addictive ... Civ VI doesn't even compare, this is peak Civilization!"
28167,better than civ VI
28168,"Very epic
"
28169,"fucking hate this shit game i'm  neber palyujnb it agan fuck fUCK
"
28170,"Definitely one of the best strategy games out there. Whether you want to sit down and hash out a quick game with your friends or if you wanna practice with different Civs/Leaders. 
The game has an array of different settings. You can change everything from resource allocation/availability to whether you have randomized enemies or teams. The base game is very good by itself, and if you're a casual player, that's all you'll need to buy.
The only thing I didn't like is how the DLC does give you an edge over the base player in terms of the Leaders you get. But that makes sense, since it is after-release DLC."
28171,its a fun game
28172,Great game. Better with DLC
28173,bismark master race
28174,One of the best
28175,I have played over 350 hours of this game. I never want it to end once I start. This game is the reason I have Steam.
28176,YE
28177,Way Superior to Civ  VI in playability terms. VI is not fun.
28178,It is a fun strategy game that is a lot of fun to take over the world.
28179,"This game is a bunch of fun. There is only one downside. You HAVE to set at minimum 8 hours to play this game in one go. Other than that tons of fun. Oh yeah, if you're gonna attempt to play for a minimal amount of time, good luck. Game is addicting."
28180,In the Civ franchise this game would be a solid example of one step forward two steps back in game design.
28181,it is gooood
28182,"AI cheats, late game is repetitive and sometimes you lose your Great War Bomber to bowmen.
Game is still insane fun!"
28183,Really fun management game either multiplayer or single player
28184,za
28185,wwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwww
28186,Good way to waste your life. ^^
28187," the best . i got it years ago. still the best. big fan.
"
28188,"I have played this game extensively, and if you are in to slower strategy games, this game is a great choice for you."
28189,v gud
28190,good
28191,amazing game
28192,"A game you can waste 100's of hours on, a game that manages to capture your attention in the first 15 minutes. These two phrases can perfectly describe Civ V, one of the best turn-based games I think I've ever played. 

10/10 
-Would spend another 200 hours on it if I could."
28193,"V/V, would turn saudi arabia into judaism and built mecca in tokyo again"
28194,really good
28195,"It's a really good game, I'd recommend getting it on sale though."
28196,brilliant game  better than 6
28197,The multiplayer is very functioning. Nice music sometimes
28198,Its completely worth all the money
28199,yes
28200,"More playable and enjoyable than Civ 6!
A classic jewel of the Civ series"

28203,"This is hands down the best game in my library, and the game I come back to the most. I am coming up on 400 hours of play with no intention of stopping any time soon."
28204,fun game
28205,Fun Game
28206,I don't get it.
28207,good
28208,The game is too loud
28209,its amazing
28210,"Yes this is a great game to play, specially against other friends"
28211,"Very fun, especially with friends. It's easy to sink hours at a time with a good friend playing with you. I would recommend!"
28212,To many damn women no Stalin or Mao Play Civ 4 has better expansions anyway.
28213,This is the best game ever
28214,"Great game to waste, er...invest your time in.  Multiple paths to victory allow entirely different run through of the same game.  Graphics are still pretty nice.  Unit promotion system gives a feel of heroism.  This game is great for an involved strategy or mindless smash play styles.  Have a great day."
28215,good game except it interrupts play to request a recommendation
28216,It's ok
28217,Perfect for testing your friendships while getting screwed by barbarians
28218,Mean strategy game
28219,"After 911 hours of pure joy, it's time I wrote my review.

I picked up Civilization V (Civ V to those of us in the know ;O) during a lengthy period off work with a particularly itchy case of piles. Having seen the news recently about that chap in his 60s getting a cologne bottle stuck up his rear passage trying to satisfy an incurable itch, I can sympathise and understand why one would be driven to such extremes. For my own particular conundrum, I must admit, I did look at my Makita 9403 belt sander in a new light. But that's a different story and we must get back to the review.

I really like Civ V and much prefer it to the current Civ VI, 10/10 would recommend."
28220,"Great game fantastic stratigy options and the option to stop it when you are busy and restart later, as opposed to a lot of real time games"
28221,amazing
28222,"The last good Civ game from Sid Meiers's Civilization series. I own both Civ 5 and Civ 6  but still play this over Civ 6, If I was owner of company I  would have sacked whom ever was responsible of making disaster Civ 6, how company could have get this so wrong. no need to break a system when it is working fine, I hope Civ 7 follows  Civ 5  path but not Civ 6, 

Civ 5 is a solid addictive game (but civ 6 is absolutely piece of hs*t)"
28223,"Having just tried Civ 6 extensively, I've returned to Civ 5. Still the best in the series, although these games take a long while to ripen. Civ 5 did not get great until the expansions added several mechanics. Once you've beat the game a couple times on the higher difficulties, make sure you install the enhanced UI add-on. The ""Perfect World"" map generator is also nice."
28224,gud
28225,good.
28226,"Awesome strategy gaming experience 
Having played 159 hours of Civ V, I feel that that I have not fully savoured  it.  So much to explore more.. I don't think I would need Civ VI beyond this!"
28227,"This is probably my favourite grand strategy game of all time. 

Pros:
Easy to understand but really deep gameplay the further you progress
No 300 hour tutorials
Fun
Sometimes really hard sometimes easy
Beautiful

Cons: 
Need to take a break between games (1 can last several days)

There a few mods that you can put in the game to have even more fun, which is fantastic.

Good game 9.5/10"
28228,I like startegy game in general but I like this game more
28229,"Amazing strategy game, for hours of fun!"
28230,is good game
28231,"I'm bad and lose to my friends who play more however I can see possibility in my own skill I just need to figure out the basics. Thats why I like it, I feel I could be unstoppable."
28232,Godlike
28233,To this day still one of the best strategy games
28234,There aren't too many games that let you roll over knights with tanks and/or helicopters.   Particularly while not feeling bad about it.
28235,didn't like it
28236,addictive
28237,"great game, you start playing at 5 PM, and after a ""few more turns"" it's 5 AM"
28238,"Very fun, but easy to lose time with. Any start is winnable if you play smart enough"
28239,I really enjoy the strategy based nature of this game.
28240,"I enjoy playing solo, against the program.  I'm not an ""ionteractive, web player."""
28241,"It's fun,"
28242,"My mom: Hurry up and come eat supper!
Me: Ok, after i finish this turn!
half an hour later
*My mom comes running in with a belt*
It was at this moment that he knew, he f***ed up"
28243,great game
28244,its a fun game
28245,"Best 4x I have ever played, hands down. Buy it and get the DLCs. You won't be disappointed."
28246,Love the game!
28247,"855 hours by this point. This was my first Civ game. Can't play any other one. I HATE the 6th one, they just added in a bunch of stuff that takes away the addictiveness of this one."
28248,"Good civ game, a change of pace from 4."
28249,"What is there to say but yes. This game is absolutely amazing, Brave New World is a must have if you are deciding on getting the game."
28250,nice
28251,iz good
28252,I have played this game way too much. It is so addicting to move through the sages and DESTROY YOUR ENEMIES. You should definitely get this game.
28253,dope
28254,will teach you how to zen like a monk
28255,My favorite and I've played every version.
28256,Good
28257,is fun tbh with friends or without

28287,"I know I'm in rookie numbers but this game is still amazing. Endless hours of fun especially with mods,"
28288,Civ V is one of the best strategy games made.  If you are deciding between Civ 5 and Civ 6 . . . go with Civ 5.  It is the far superior game and way less slow and glitchy.  6 has issues and is just plain boring at times because of how long it takes to make your next move.  5 is quick in its AI processing and interesting to play . . . 5 is easily one of my top 3 PC games of all-time.
28289,a great war game soooooooon!!!!
28290,"I'm a big, long-term Civilization fan and have played both Civ III and Civ IV extensively. I really enjoy Civ V. The graphics are gorgeous, and the game play has several improvements, most notably the added difficulty in taking cities. I like this both when I'm trying to take a city, (as it creates more of a challenge, and greater satisfaction when I am successful), and when I'm defending a city. It feels like a fairer, more realistic venture; you can't just step into a city and take it for your own. And the amount of troops necessary to defend your borders feels more reasonable than in past versions of the game -- which is to say, you don't need as many units, and the units you do have seem more valuable.

I've heard Civ VI is not very good, so I'm going to skip that one, but Civ V is totally satisfying in every way it could be."
28291,ITS OKAY
28292,wonderful game that can be set up at any pace to suit your play style. Can be tuned to be mostly diplomatic world builder if thats your thing like it is mine
28293,is good yah

28327,"Another Sid Meir classic, Civ V is balanced, thoughtful, and fun, with a number of different ways to win. The DLC that add religion is pretty cool, but the additional races and the changes to the cultural victory path are what really make it. Turn-based, no twitch elements at all, it's a game where you can take your time and think things through. You can micro-mange to your heart's content, or let the governors deal with the minutia."
28328,Fun
28329,good game
28330,Its a good game nothing is quite like this tile game and also 6 is included in a bundle deal with risingstorm kick but love you guys 2K rocks!
28331,ayyyy lmao
28332,It's the best CIV ever.  Come on.  You know it.
28333,good
28334,its pretty darn good. A classic that should be remembered
28335,"yes
"
28336,.
28337,it just works...after help from Angry Reddit Man
28338,"Civilization V is the worst best game. If it weren't for the essentially mandatory mods required to enjoy this game Firaxis's dreadful DLC policy and utterly embarrassing incompetence in game design & development would be more painfully overt than they already are. In fact, it's astonishing that Firaxis hasn't managed to spoil the great potential of Civilization V. 

Seeing as you can't even buy the full Civ VI game due to Firaxis's notoriously dreadful DLC policy, I'd buy Civilization V complete bundle for a ludicrous $34.47 ""sale""."
28339,"Time sink, very fun"
28340,It's decent
28341,Still the best Civ game to date.
28342,Great Game!
28343,Great Game. love the replay ability.
28344,Great Game!!!!!
28345,"this is probably the best civ game, but the mods are what makes it worth it."
28346,i start playing an notice 12hrs have passed
28347,It's great
28348,Multiplayer is broken.
28349,Bro just get the game
28350,It's like a crippling addiction but I love it. Creating nukes in 1856 lol.
28351,"A worse civ 4. Many years after release and I still think they didn't handle unit stacking properly. Removing until stacking was a good thing, but range mechanics needed to be looked at for it to actually work. Unit stacking also let's you cheese ai super hard by kiting them when you aren't at war. I have delayed ai city placement by 40 turns by just kiting them."
28352,Do not buy this game if you plan on playing with friends on other operating systems than your own. I spent a lot of money to buy this game for my girlfriend only to find that we cannot play together since I am on a PC and she is on a Mac. There is a bug that it seems the developers have no plan to fix.
28353,its good
28354,A shadow of its former incarnations
28355,good game
28356,"If you can allow yourself to start a new game after 10 PM, you're probably doing something wrong with your life."
28357,If you're stuck deciding between Civ V and Civ VI you should pick this one.

28365,With the new Mac update cross-play multiplayer between mac and pc is completely ruined. Can not recommend as multiplayer is the best part of this experience.
28366,I love using this game to destroy my friends and ruin friendships.(Friendships ruined 3)
28367,Never ending fun!
28368,Great classic game!
28369,"I liked the variety of maps and civs and the leisurely play style.
I don't like the extremely slow game play in late games - some civs took 1/2 hr to make a turn.
I usually turned the game off at this point and started a new game."

28382,amazing game
28383,"Civ V is a very, very fun game. I've yet to find any bugs in the game, and it hardly ever gets stale when you're playing with friends. I can't think of any cons. If you like real-time strategy games like risk, this is a game worth trying."
28384,Its almost 2020 and I'm still going back to this. I own Civ 6 and I just don't like it as much. I still think the late game feels a little stale but I'm obviously still having fun with it.
28385,Good stuff. Gandhi's a cunt.
28386,"I played Civ I in the early '90's and loved it. Tried the others, but I like Civ V the best"
28387,Forget about time when playing this game.

28427,Yes
28428,"I've been playing the Civ series since 3 originally came out when I was little. 5 is easily the best game in the franchise, outside of my biased and nostalgia-fueled love for 3. 

5 Complete is worth the money. Hopefully 7, whenever it comes, will be closer to it than 6."
28429,"With this being the only game in the series that I have played, I'm not sure as to what features may or may not be in other games in the Civilization series, but I have to say that in the countless hours I've put into this game, not one of them has left me bored. This game has an insane amount of replayability. There are so many different options to choose from and so many strategies and leaders that no other playthrough will be the same."
28430,love this game so many different ways to play and mods to discover. the only thing i dont like is you cant take over cities with spys anymore :-( that was always loads of fun.

28452,"A reliable staple of the turn-based strategy genre. An incredible amount of depth and replayability.

With a multiplayer mod called Lekmod, this game has a tight-knit and active multiplayer community going into 2020."
28453,"One of the only games where i can sit down at 10AM and go: ""Yea, it's a Civ day today"" And then the entire day just dissapears while i focus on becoming world leader. Sometimes all goes well and sometimes you get really close just to fall at the finishline. Either way it's a very fun and engaging game."

28459,Good game
28460,"I would say that the reason ive played this game is because 
*  looks and sounds good
* Easy to picup and learn
* you can both tryhard and give yourself a challenge and you can turn down difficulty and relax with it
* it is not a very difficult game in general but the game still requires some hours to get through. 

overall its just a nice chill game i play when league is tilting me"
28461,"if ur into strategic games I'd say this would be one of the greatest made. My favourite would have to be Civ III, but this game pulls u in."

28473,Well... At least I'm not out doing meth.
28474,very nice very good
28475,its alright
28476,"this is the only civ game i ever played alot, i spent some time on it before the dlc etc bought all the dlc eventually still played it and sometimes its nice to fire it up and go conquer some civs i tried civ 6 at my cousins and i just hated the overhaul the cartoon visuals i cant stand it personally so im sticking with this civ until the next one, anyways definitly recommend this full price or on sale or even better for the complete collection i havent sunk as much time into this as others have playing it but i know this is one of those games from now heck even 5-10 years from now i'll turn on and play a few games here and there the visuals still hold up well today and looks miles better then civ 6"
28477,Great game! Usually go for science victories. An easy way to lose track of and waste your time entirely.
28478,.
28479,its probably the best and most relaxing strategy based game out there. For sure better with the expansions.
28480,Yes
28481,Still fun to this day.

28503,Does what it says on the tin.
28504,"Though a relatively simple 4X game, its fairly good. On top of that, it lacks much of the un-needed chaff of civ6."
28505,Best strategy game ever made 100% would recommend no reason not to play.
28506,A turn-based strategy classic
28507,Highest-quality gameplay in the world. I've been playing this series since its first iteration in the 90s. Couldn't love it more!
28508,Best Civ. game ever made. The successor is just not as good.
28509,for any one that loves city builders and territory TBS  games this is the one for you with the workshop community theres hours and hours of different things to play
28510,f
28511,Has been the best game for this perticular genre since title 1 and title 5 is straightforward improvement about it

28518,"[h1][u][b]Short Version[/b][/u][/h1]
It's rare for me to play a strategy game(or even any game for that matter) for 16 hrs straight or more with no breaks inbetween, excluding toilet breaks as I can't keep that in, for a few days (and less than a few hours sleep when my eyes just can't keep up with the adrenaline rush), but this game takes the cake!

The only other games I could think of that I've spent a whole day (12+ hrs straight with no breaks, excluding toilet) for a few days straight or more would be Killing Floor or Counter Strike Condition Zero back in the day. 

[h1][u][b]Long Version - may or may not contain spoilers, you have been warned...[/b][/u][/h1][spoiler]
Reviewing with the complete version if that matters.

[h1]Story[/h1]
There's a tutorial which is somewhat helpful. There are scenarios you can follow and play through; otherwise there isn't really a campaign story for this specific game setting...

[h1]Graphics[/h1]
Starting to age when you've been spoiled with games using 2019 graphics (not that I've played any that was released this year but have seen trailers and screenshots....if that counts? :P) from those high budgeted titles. 

My SLi 770s still holds up. 60 frames minimum (disregarding load times) and maybe 200 max depending on your zoom level at graphical settings. I play my game at 2560x1440 with all eye candy on.

[h1]Gameplay[/h1]
Aww man, when you are up against an AI who can fight toe to toe with you(and not be a princess about it or too manly for you), you know you met the right match! There are of course difficulty settings to pick from ranging from ""This is my first time, please be gentle with me..."" to ""I'm a god so throw everything at me and I will take it like the masochist I am!"" extreme ends.

The game is like chess, except you can have more than two players. In the lower difficulties, you get bonuses to happiness and gold income I think. In the higher difficulties, you get pegged with an upkeep that you'll need to monitor VERY CLOSELY and the computer AI players get a boost to their economy, tech and millitary on the get go. So you're just handicapped to give the AI players a starting so you just have to play catch up and not get wipe out in the process.

Like chess, there are specific strategies and tactics to take out a specific unit; they also incorporated a rock scissors paper type system to help with that. To beat a rock unit, you need a paper unit and to beat paper unit you need scissors. Rock is used to beat scissors and the circles closes.

[h1]Audio[/h1]
Stereo only, though I don't even know if surround sound would do any justice to a isometric view turned based game. Music and sound effects can get repetitive especially if you've been chugging along 16 hrs straight for a few days with sleep inbetween the long sessions....

[h1]Other notes (issues, complaints or otherwise)[/h1]
Game sometimes experiences freezing where I need to restart the game. A bit of pain if I haven't saved and had a good game going only to restart back to my last save point....

Bugs and glitches - such as the bombers just circling around continuously bombing its target for several rounds before the game ticks it off saying ""You can stop the bombing run now..."" 

There are graphical glitches too, like weird random stretched triangles or path arrow suddenly snaps and stretches out - I'll see if I can take a screenshot of that and link it here....but not sure if that's to do with my cards failing or the game.....

Haven't tried out multiplayer yet so no comment on that.

I wish there was an undo button when you *accidentally* whether intentionally to see what would happen or unintentionally clicked attack or move or any action, because your fingers are twitchy....because in I'm pretty sure you can do that in a chess match.... But I suppose I'll just have to settle with save scumming to test things out.....

28520,Good for all ages and skill levels
28521,Very fun game
28522,Excellent strategy game that has an immense amount of replayability. Several difficulty options create enjoyment for players from the most casual to the challenge seeking. Good luck and build strong!
28523,it's good
28524,"I love how my people can demand silver and gold while Iron have not been discovered yet xD
-My King, we need Silver!
-What is that?
-We do not know. But we need it!"
28525,"I like the game much better than VI. I have both games, but rarely play Civ VI."

28532,lol
28533,good
28534,This is a fun game.
28535,Cheaper than Civ 6 and twice as stable.  6 isn't bad its visually pleasing but the cost of DLC is a joke.  And I already got boned on Beyond Earth.
28536,good
28537,I like that it is lot like Risk.
28538,great game 10/10
28539,it okay
28540,not a bad way to pass time
28541,I have gotten into full on fist fights with my roommates over forward settling overall great game
28542,It's an awesome game that I can't really explain why but it's super engaging and has taught me a lot about history while still being a fun game
28543,"Muito bom, superou minhas expectativas, Até por que não esperava que uma cidade fosse tão dificil de dominar, mas umas coisas eu fiquei em duvida, não pela jogabilidade, mas sim pela linguagem , não sou muito bom com traduções, então espero que algum dia esse jogo seja traduzido para o português."
28544,"Fun game to not take overly seriously, especially when mods are activated. Lots of fun to kill time"
28545,Epic game get it for epicness
28546,good
28547,"Absolutely fantastic game, I have played nearly 400 hours (16.7 days) and I will keep playing for quite a while. The different nations are all interesting and no one has a distinct advantage, the graphics are good and you can play in a variety of ways. The UI is very informative but not too overwhelming and it is very easy to keep track of everything going on. The soundtrack is very fun to listen to and doesn't overwhelm or distract you. This game is perfect for casual players and professionals alike so long as you are willing to sit down and enjoy for a few hours. The ability to play on one computer is also a lot of fun because it means you only need to buy it once to play with more than one person, however, the fact that you can play online with friends is a nice feature as well. Would 100% recommend especially during sales where you can also get the DLC such as Brave New World and Gods and Kings for a VERY low price."
28548,"One of my favourite games ever. One of those games you can come back to time and time again, and get sucked in every time. Endless re-play value."
28549,"interesting game to play, keeps you thinking"
28550,Very good game.
28551,Very fascinating game
28552,good
28553,yup its good
28554,"Civ 5 is the whole reason I believe history is doom to repeat itself. If you play this game with your friends and don't come out thinking your bff is actually trying to cuck you by ganging up with the rest of your friends to assassinate you because you have ""tOo MuCh PoWeR"" then start a civil war amongst themeselves for your resources. Than A: you haven't read Julius Caesar, B: don't know the history of Roman or C: actually think you have friends. 

- 7/10 better then sliced bread 

///side note/// You create a booming economy, have a happy population, and are at peace with everyone but make one infantry unit and suddenly you're a warmonger for life."

28584,Yeah
28585,Great CIV game
28586,good ol civ fun get it on sale
28587,"If you're into RPG's this is a good one. Regardless of how many times you play the game is always different. I truly enjoy the combat and the diversity of the play. Always exciting to me.
"
28588,Every 6 months or so I circle back to this game and it immediately obliterates 100 hours of my free time like it's nothing
28589,Great stuff
28590,I love this game. Bought a while ago and there is a newer version out but I love playing. Trying to win with all the civilizations. Very addicting. Highly...highly recommend .
28591,Great in-depth game with many levels of play. Hard to play it out because it can be different every time
28592,Love this game as I have loved all of the Civ games
28593,"You start in 4,000 BC with a single city and a single warrior. From there you can expand, explore, build, and discover. The journey leads throughout time as each new technology discovered brings you closer to the modern age of wonders. You can conquer the world, or you can be a diplomat, or a scientist, so many different ways to win, what will your destiny be? Can you build a civilization that will stand the test of time?"
28594,It's an okay game. I'm slowly starting to learn the basics now.
28595,"I´ve played this game for only 2 hours, the other 265 I spent on listening to the Dutch and their ridiculous language"
28596,"This game is good, but total war medieval 2 is better"
28597,Ok 1 more hour...
28598,"I very much like the strategy aspects of this game, it is a great way to kill time when you have nothing to do, and a lot of time in which to do it."
28599,"Overall a really strong, fun, challenging game! Even years after buying it I still thoroughly enjoy single-player and multiplayer with friends."
28600,"Great game over all, but you'll end up playing multiplayer with friends for several hours only to have one lose connection, having them return, and being unable to begin the next turn corrupting your save. This is especially stupid because it seems to be a simple and common problem that has received no support. It is infuriating."
28601,"MULTIPLAYER SUCKS BIG DONG. IF SOMEONE DISCONNECTS FOR ANY REASON, YOU CANNOT KEEP PLAYING. IT ALWAYS GLITCHES OUT AND MAKES THE PLAYER THAT REJOINS ""WAITING ON OTHER PLAYERS."" IF THEY FIX THAT BUG, THIS GAME WOULD BE AWESOME. PLEASE FIX THIS BUG."
28602,Easily the most well-rounded and easy to get into 4X strategy game I know.
28603,UHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHh
28604,it was good
28605,"TLDR: It's Civ and it rules :) 

Civ 3 & 5 are my favorites so far. It's very hard for me to switch to Civ 6 after these two.

You need o set aside roughly two days if you want to complete a game. The fact that units don't stack (with some reasonable exceptions) make everything so much better

Each nation has a decent amount of personal flavor (didn't try them all though)

Religion is a bit of a game-changer but hard to master (fortunately, you don't need to)"
28606,10/10
28607,"Horrible Mac OS update, always version mismatch when we try to play multiplayer. Hope this will be resolved soon"
28608,Don't play this game with friends unless you want one of them spamming the most stupidly named religion across your proud and glorious empire
28609,b
28610,"Always fun to play.  Plenty of customization to the game parameters helps ensure you enjoy the experience each time.  

Game play is intuitive and well-paced; always leaving you wanting 'just one more turn'."

28612,Best casual strategy game ever
28613,"fam this good and epico in the same game, and i mean like woah thats pre crazy"

28620,bought this game at one of the lowest points in my life. 2 years later i can now successfully manage a civilizations economy while at the same time conquer the world. a must buy for anyone desperate to fill a void in their life.
28621,Great turn-based game
28622,Its alright
28623,"It's a good game

'nuff said"
28624,"Endless replayability, and fun building empires, only to watch them be destroyed through treachery, or soar to diplomatic, or mitlitary supremacy."
28625,Fantastic game! A must play for anyone who enjoys turn based strategy games.
28626,TERRIBLE lol
28627,"This game is probably the best in the series (so far). Like the Civ games that come before it, you really need the expansions, so buy the Game of The Year Edition or whatever it's called. The move away from stacking units makes the game a lot more interesting and the AI is a little less insane. They still hold grudges like a mother, but the actions they take are SLIGHTLY more rational than in Civ 4. They also will forgive ""transgressions"" after like, 500 years, instead of never. This is my most played game on steam and I still play it to this day; even after buying Civ VI."
28628,"This is my most played game on steam. It's a great way to pass the time, and I always find it fun to explore new maps. The AI gets really really easy to bat around after a while because difficulties don't make them better, they just get big boosts. Very moddable. Make sure to get the complete bundle like with all other civ games."
28629,No. 1 TBS
28630,oh baby it's so good like one of the best things u could plpay if u wanted to and you were bored and home from school.

28645,is gud
28646,"its grate so much better with the exspansions than the base game so eazy to louse time in this game and pull your head out to relise its been four of five hours and you should eat something.


"
28647,"I've been playing Civ since 1993, and as usual taking my time deciding whether to drop Civ V in favor of the newest version. Even though one of the things I've wanted for the past 20 years, being able to connect a city to the sea or cut through an Isthmus more than a single hex wide, has finally been implemented in Civ VI.

So I long ago got over Gandhi going Postal in Civ V and Nuking me a few turns after giving him a really sweet trade and research deal, spurning offers of a defensive alliance and denouncing me as a warmonger when I was trying to peacefully keep our chief rival in check and preserve my trading partners.

I played the plain vanilla original version for years, so you might try getting that when its on deep discount and get the Definitive Edition Cyber Week next year if you want the full game.

Its best played with all the upgrades enabled - I just used the full map pack and units without Gods & Kings enabled, but you need both G&K and Gathering Storm to get full benefit of the changes to the new units.  Now Naval units are divided between Melee and Ranged units, and most unit strength and attributes showed significant changes which alter most, but not all, of my old complaints about vanilla Civ V . Social Policies are reshuffled too.

I like the shoot and scoot capability of horse and camel archers, but wish the developers would at least watch enough HistoryChannel (tm) to notice that Egyptian war chariots in real life used their light weight and superior mobility to pull back after ranged fire as well. 

I particularly enjoyed using ""Shoot and Scoot"" Rocket Artillery in Civ III, and thought it a shame when they lost the ability to withdraw after firing. But that Does make sieges a bit more of a challenge!  Neither chariots nor Rocket Artillery were changed for the Definitive Edition.

I also always thought Archers should eventually upgrade into Mortar teams rather than regular infantry, so they could still use their ranged fire attributes. In vanilla Civ V, upgrade them to Crossbowmen ASAP, and then to Riflemen after they get the City Attack bonus (and hopefully are almost ready for another promotion).  With the Definitive Edition crossbows upgrade to Gatling guns (range 1) machine-guns and Bazookas stronger than Infantry.

Back in Civ III cavalry could retreat rather than stand and be destroyed by a more powerful but slower unit, so I'm looking forward to that in Civ VI as I get into it.  But I could never understand why Civ didn't allow Modern Cavalry to take advantage of defensive Terrain in Fortified mode, presumably giving up a hex of movement to take a dismounted firing position as Civ's unit description says they could do.  Like Buford at Gettysburg.

That would mean Lancers (and Knights) would only match or overwhelm Modern Cavalry if they caught the Cavalry (or Cossacks) unfortified after ending a turn on the move.

Patton even argued Cavalry could defeat Lancers by extending their sword arm and turning the point of the lance with the sword at the last moment, but I'd rather trust in my Colt 45, preferably Model 1911 semi-automatic!

At least Civ V Definitive Edition takes away the Knight's and Lancer's bonus against cavalry until their combat bonus for open and rough terrain reach Level 3.

I finally bought Civ VI and look forward to seeing all it has to offer.  

Maybe some day workboats will enable the nearest city to work water resources more than 3 hexes away...  although I'd like to see Any atolls within your national waters to be 'workable' as well. The Basques and Portuguese were fishing the Grand Banks SE of Newfoundland when Columbus made his first voyages to the Caribbean.

But I plan to keep Civ V installed for a good while.   Newbies who see it cheap will find it worthwhile as well -  but I strongly recommend the Definitive Edition as their ultimate goal."
28648,'tis a game. thou game shall continue to be a game.
28649,"We all know it and love it. Unless you don't, in which case you hate it."
28650,I've spent almost 400 hours on this game... Civ VI can keep trying.... but it'll never be a Civ V. I love this game. Get your friends on and start a super small world and go at it! you will either have fun or end up crying lol anyways... Good Luck!
28651,its a good game
28652,no pause needed try and rule the world game turn based game
28653,Timeless Classic - Far better than CIV 6
28654, i LIKE IT i HAVE PLAYED THE GAME FOR ALMOST 3000 HOURS
28655,the game is awesome
28656,It is cool
28657,Best Civilization instalment hands down.
28658,"This is a very good strategic game. I would suggest you  play it on the earth map in huge which is best, at whatever level your comfortable with"
28659,"In a world where I know better than world leaders, I get to prove it with this game"
28660,Always set aside ~3 hours more than you intent to when you begin playing.
28661,fun game
28662,Great game
28663,such a great game!
28664,is good
28665,"Trying it out for the first time with a friend, it has a very difficult learning curve but the kicker was that the game kicked us both from our campaign and wouldn't let us reconnect no mather what"
28666,it good
28667,"broken launcher that advertises civ 6 but wont let me play civ 5 and even tried all the workarounds, another game i paid money for stolen from me by the same company i paid.

some legality issues here."
28668,Civilization has been great from it's inception!
28669,Still better than Civ 6
28670,If you like strategy games then this is one of the best strategy games there is
28671,is good

28677,Civ makes me go MMMMMmmmmMMMMM
28678,big fan of the series. i purchased the new civ when it was on sale but i live in the sticks so it would take days to download. purchased this and downloaded in a day i havnt put it down since then. #prayformywifi
28679,E
28680,Awesome part of the Civ progression
28681,fun
28682,"Again, it's a Civ game. If you've played Civ, you already know what I'm talking about. I shouldn't have to say anything else."
28683,Great game
28684,Great strat Game lots of fun with friends
28685,"is a 5 star game
"
28686,Building a civilization is fun.
28687,"It gave me the cancer boss
"
28688,"its just the bad version of civ iv, but all in all that's still pretty good. if youre a casual player then this is the best civ game for you, but if youre a more serious strategy game player you should get civ iv beyond the sword instead."
28689,all around enjoyable game
28690,aa
28691,awesome
28692,it fun game
28693,good game
28694,"Ah, Civilization 5, how to even begin praising this game... I think I'll start with a nice ordered list to keep things easy.

++ Infinite ways to experience the game. Singleplayer or multiplayer, a huge range of difficulties (not all of them balanced), tons of leaders, historical scenarios, game modes, maps, mods, and fan content.
+ Easy to learn, difficult to master. Just like with many grand strategy games, Civ V has deep mechanics that can be grasped right away but take many hours to learn precisely how they work and how to take advantage of them. This could be seen as a negative, but it's exactly what I like in a game.
+ The singleplayer is good, but the multiplayer is where this game really shines for me. And no I'm not talking about online matches with randos, I'm talking about getting five buds together in a room and playing Civ for six hours straight. It's truly the superior way to experience the game. All diplomacy (begging, threatening, screaming) can be done face to face instead of over the game's clunky trading system. It's truly a blast, and if you have a chance to play this with your friends I highly recommend it.
~ Music and graphics. Putting this in the neutral category because they kind of fade into the background after 200+ hours played. I usually end up turning the music off and just playing my own.
- Length of games. Even on the fastest speed, singleplayer Civ games can take upwards of four hours to complete, which is pretty brutal for one sitting. Obviously though if you're down for that then this will not affect your experience whatsoever.
- Minor multiplayer jank. I've played this game on and off over six years with the same group of friends, and we've only ever finished two games, due to corrupted saves, NPCs not ending their turns, infinite loading glitches, and probably others. This makes it even more monumental when we actually finish one, but still, it's not great.
- NPC difficulty scaling. Difficulties 3-5 are basically the only ones worth playing unless you're a complete glutton for punishment, because at the higher difficulties, instead of making the AI smarter the NPC nations just get bonuses to their economy and resources to give them an edge against you. Not really that fun or balanced in my opinion.

Overall Civ V is a game that has given me a ton of enjoyment over the years, and I think I picked it up on sale with all the DLC for like $40 back in 2012. Have never even tried Civ 6 because this game is all I need."
28695,good game.
28696,"Just try it if you have a chance, it's really just a complicated turn based game"
28697,"I've been playing Civ since the 1st game. 

IMHO, Civ V is the best version, more game options and less clunky mechanics than IV and much better user interface than Civ VI"
28698,Great game loads of fun
28699,Great strategy game. Fun to play.
28700,e

28723,This one is fun
28724,One of the best strategy games I have ever played
28725,its alright innit
28726,<yes
28727,"What is there to say about this game other than what other people already said? I don't know. I have been playing games for almost 30 years now, from the era of atari and others. I can tell you, without a doubt, that this game is in my top 100 list now (when its with all DLC, since i never played it without DLC).

I will not write what the game is about, since there are many people who already did it and i couldn't explain it better than them.

All i can say is, this game is an almost unrealistic example of price/value. For such a low price, it gives you this much excitement, sleepless nights (consider the fact that i am not very young and i have many responsibilities as a married man), dreaming about the clash of the warmongers in my sleep and thinking about my next strategy when i wake up tomorrow. And hope that Genghis will not plunder my lands one more time and try to lay waste to my cities again, so i can increase my culture and science.

I recommend, no ask you to buy it. Play it. You will not regret it. You will thank me. Check the overall rating. Nuff said. Have the civ 5 experience in your life as someone who likes games. Absolute immersion.

Thank you Firaxis."
28728,Awesome game!
28729,Almost as good as full 8 hours of sleep.
28730,"good game much citys
"
28731,cool

If you do not play this game you are not awesome"

"
28734,pun
28735,fun yet time consuming. to addicting
28736,good
28737,"I still think that Civ V is still better than Civ VI.  The game has reasonable AI, combat and no stupid districts. Anyone wanting to play a great Civ game, play Civ V. If you're a beginner to the genre, I would definitely recommend the game. Overall, it's just a better game, simpler and an overall much better experience for the player. The UI is nicer and the overall style of the game is nicer as well. No BS mechanics to ruin your experience of the game. [b]You cannot fully experience the game without ALL OF THE EXPANSIONS AND DLC![/b]"
28738,git good
28739,awesome game
28740,xd
28741,"I used to play Civ 2 and Civ 3 when I was younger, then I lost my steam account's password. When I made my new account I was pretty sad that I couldn't play the new installation when Civ 5 came out, but then I saw it on sale with all the DLC for $2 a few years ago and I was just like ""why not?"". I got the game, not expecting much because of what I had heard about the brand new Civ 6, but what I got well exceeded my expectations. What I got for that $2 was a game that I would end up getting almost 500 hours on (I might have 500 hours when you are seeing this) and that I would learn a lot about history from. When I played as a kid I would always pick Germany because they used to be able to convert encampments into cities. When I learned that they couldn't I was not disappointed, but excited to play new countries. Let me just say, this is the best Civ game I have ever played, and unless they fix Civ 6 or they make Civ 7 amazing, will probably be the best Civ game I have played for a while to come. This is a must buy, and if you can't afford it, just wait for a sale like I did (You will not regret it)."
28742,Yes
28743,cool
28744,mmmmmm good
28745,"good game, i hear the dlc makes it even better"
28746,EXCELLENT GAME
28747,"A game under default settings could take days to complete but that's what makes Civilization so cool. Its laid back and fun to fool with when you are bored, and when you go to war and are in a heated battle you get that little nervous feeling that you feel reaching the top of a roller coaster. Replay value out the wazoo! Highly recommend."
28748,it aight
28749,Challenging but yet fun .
28750,all around best game for your dollar
28751,GAME IS DOPE
28752,This game is so much fun!  I  will never get tired of playing it!
28753,Gotta love Civilization!
28754,Awesome strategy game
28755,"You know what Civ is, You know what to expect based on everyone else's reviews. I don't have the time to articulate my feelings for this game other than that across both of my accounts I've spent around 1k hours enjoying this amazing game. If you like historical strategy games this is a really good one."
28756,"it fun. it slow pace, but very fun."
28757,"I miss the ability of culture to take over cities, but otherwise this steps up directly in the vein of classic Civilization games and brings them forward.  The inability to move through other friendly units is a little annoying, but I kind of get it.
"
28758,It's a great game.
28759,I think the 520 hours of play speaks for itself. Its a family pass time to get together for 3-4 hours and play.
28760,"I think that Civ 5 is one of the best, if not the best, turn-based strategy game you will ever play"
28761,its nice
28762,"It was good
"
28763,"One game a day keeps your social life away
11/10 would do it again"
28764,ITS GOOD
28765,In a life full of darkness and despair. Civ 5 has made me feel like my children and wife are alive again.
28766,yes
28767,"Classic Civ - addictive play - just want to see what happens with one more turn, or achieve the next tech research etc.  Great fun"
28768,The best game of turn-based strategy there is.
28769,its big may-mays
28770,My favourite game
28771,Gets old fast.
28772,Brilliant strategy game.  Probably the best!
28773,Great game
28774,Easily one of the best strategical games I have ever played. Every feature and DLC of this game makes this game exponentially better. This game is the definition of a perfect game that provides innovative strategy and risk which I personally love.
28775,"It has clean graphics, a great tutorial, complex game play, and still manages to keep the mastery of what made Civ such a great franchise."
28776,good time killer
28777,"As I progress to new levels, it pushes me to appreciate different aspects of the game, for example, trade or military action."
28778,My favorite Civ. I just haven't warmed up to VI yet.

28780,games ok. 10/10
28781,"What can I say, Civ is always fun!"
28782,"If you have plenty of time to burn, play this game. 17 hours to play a single game.
Addictive to a point that I'm afraid to play another round."
28783,It's ok
28784,"Great way to get started in playing turn based strategy games, highly fun and addictive, great fun by yourself and even better with friends."
28785,"It's pretty neat. Wasted a lot of time on it, worth the money."
28786,"its amazing
"
28787,better then civ6
28788,i enjoy it as much as the others
28789,It's a great game.
28790,I can not recommend this game enough. You can just sit down and spend 12 hour playing and it feels as if only 15 minutes have passed. One of my favorite games.
28791,"By far the best Civ game I've ever played. (Haven't played 1 or 2, but i've played the rest) The DLC add a lot, but I truly love the base game the most."
28792,Great game and classic. Still playable so many years after its release.
28793,This game is incredibly dumbed down from previous Civ versions. I got this on sale for a few dollars and regret even spending that on it. Civ 4 is so much better; much more nuanced and deep.
28794,Great game. Recommend for everyone who got a strategic itch
28795,ist gut
28796,loved it
28797,Played a little bit. Seems pretty good. Might need to play a bit more to definitively say it's a good game.
28798,Board games are good and this is a digital board game. In fact this is the best iteration of this particular digital board game.
28799,Civilization is one of the best games you can play.
28800,Easy way to kill time on a flight or to destroy friendships because all you do anymore is play civ
28801,Cool game. DLC prices are a bummer. 8/10
28802,Good strategy turn-based game for beginners or those who just like strategy games.   Possibly the best version.
28803,"Banging game to play alone or with others and also much better than CIV 6, DO NOT GET CIV 6"
28804,I have played every civ game before this one and civ 5 is definitely the best one. Love this game.
28805,Best civ game ever... Played it for 530hours and still going ^^
28806,I can recommend this Game.
28807,fun fun fucking fun
28808,It's Civ brah
28809,"This is an extremely fun game.
I'm still not all that great at it, I don't believe.
I'm honestly not that great at these types of games.
However, Civilization V is very addicting. 
It's something I never thought I'd play.
After playing it though, I'm happy I did.
I may only have 31 hours in it (at the time of writing this)
But it's cause I just often don't have time."
28810,Fun
28811,stable and easy to set up games. continued customer support. build system nice and easy to learn and use.
28812,"very intuitive interface, and great graphics!"
28813,it is so good
28814,Its a really great game and its is good for people who cant afford the newest version.
28815,Still the best Civilization game out there.
28816,I just wanted to recommend a great game
28817,I liked the game mechanics and the ability to learn and use your own strategies to play the game and that there is no set way to win with multiply outcomes
28818,Better than 6...
28819,It's pretty good...
28820,This game is a fun and challenging way to connect with friends and maybe even learn a little history.
28821,This's one of the best games on the world i believe.
28822,This game is a good one to get lost in. But some aspects are over powered. 4.5/5
28823,Great 4X game that can give you endless hours of gameplay. and the mods can double that.
28824,Really fun Takes a while to finish it though
28825,A timeless game that you can get sucked into for hours and not realize.
28826,lit game
28827,"Peace is a fleeting illusion and alliances are nothing. Never trust a so-called ""ally,"" and always expand your military might lest others expand and destroy you."
28828,Ehh Its good
28829,This game is awesome. I really enjoyed taking over the world.
28830,Just finished my first game. Doesn't seem too bad.
28831,Meh its okay
28832,gud
28833,Fun and realistic!
28834,"Great game, if you can get friends to join, it a weeks worth spent"
28835,Quite simply the greatest turn-based strategy game I have ever played. I could play this game for another 900 hours and never get tired with it.
28836,gr8 stuff m8 i r8 8/8
28837,I prefer this one to Civ 6.
28838,epic
28839,Endless hours of fun.
28840,I've played a bit.
28841,it is very fun and I love social studies
28842,"I received this game for my 13th birthday. I'm now about to turn 18, and since that day I've put over 1,000 hours into it. It's my favorite game of all time. This means that I'm well aware of its flaws as well (the AI is still hilariously dumb and late-game play can be a chore), but the sheer magic of this game when you pull off something you've got no right to is unparalleled in any other game I've played. The modding scene is second to none. The community is the best I've ever encountered in gaming, and the amount that it's been able to mine out of an admittedly pretty simple game is nothing short of astounding. This game has made me friends, it's endless fun, and I couldn't recommend it more."
28843,Amazing fun
28844,Joe Mamma
28845,AWESOME
28846,its pretty fun
28847,no this game is bullshit and poland is gay
28848,time eater
28849,I always have a ton of fun playing this game.
28850,everything
28851,Addictive and better than Civ 6
28852,A really fun turn-based strategy game. Really worth your money.
28853,"This game is incredibly addicting, and the mods are stunning and add more to the already robust replayability."
28854,Its time consuming but it is worth picking it up. Me and my friend quite enjoy playing against each other in this game.
28855,"imho, the best of the Civ series as far as gameplay. Beyond Earth is almost but not quite better"
28856,Fun game
28857,I liked this version of Civ the best because of the balence between all the different elements.  It's not just build more cities than the other guys such as Civ III.  You can win the game with 1 ciiy if you play carefully.
28858,"Fun as hell, a true time waster of the best kind"
28859,rob said it was good
28860,-
28861,Great game. Hours of complexity combined with easy to pick up mechanics
28862,good
28863,exteremly good gameplay.. :)
28864,Civilization is the best series of strategy games on the market and this is the best version including being better than Civ 6
28865,turn based pretty nice
28866,"Much better as Civ 6. Not as pretty, but looks isn't all you know."
28867,"It takes time to dive in Civilization, but it's an insanely profound game, with tons of subtleties. Definitely one of the best game ever and very likely the one with the most replayability ever."
28868,"Great game. Just AI is stupid af. Need Alexander to go to war with William. Offer him about couple hundred gold. He won't go to war with William unless I give him 3/4 of my oil, all my coal, and pretty much all my income on top of the gold. Tell him to suck a fat one of course. Alexander then goes to war with WIlliam on  his own accord the next turn. 

Still, great game."
28869,Польша может в космос!
28870,"This game is great to play on your own, but even better to play with friends."
28871,"this game will consume you and your time, near impossible to stop playing"
28872,Best Civ game every made. Enjoyable from casual to hardcore and all the levels in between.
28873,"fun game, much like, will get six when have money"
28874,It's a great game.
28875,"Good game, I just wish there was a fast forward feature"
28876,"> 10:00 PM; Turn 78 ""Just one more turn and I'll go to bed"". 

>3:00 AM; Turn 192 ""Well no point in sleeping now"".

With all the expansions this game is well worth it. If you subscribe to Ghengis Khan's view on what's good in life, doubly so.

28877,its okay I guess
28878,ruined my life very fun game
28879,"Great Game, Purchased the game three years ago during Black Friday Sale and indeed enjoyed them very much."
28880,makes me hard
28881,"My first introduction to the Civilization franchise was in Revolution for the console. So when I eventually built my rig and got Civ5 I was absolutely overwhelmed. Since I bought BNW right off the bat the content discouraged me  from playing but I knew there was curve I had to learn. Before I knew it while trying to ""learn"" the game I was already 160 turns deep and absolutely lost into the game. I grew to love it and now I absolutely try to avoid playing this late at nights because before I know it hours would have passed by. The amount of content you get with the BNW Edition is STUPID HIGH. You will not be running short on fun anytime soon, this game SLAPS! So many funny scenarios or ironies happen. 

For Example in one of my Earth playthrough's I'm America. Located in the Middle East. Own all of North Africa and have 0 oil deposits. I'm at war and fighting for my life against the Shoshone Native Americans. What a weird universe. Highly recommend game, there's a curve to learn!"
28882,iss goo
28883,"Lot of depth to this one - very replayable!  You must use strategy to win and luck doesn't hurt, but luck only takes you so far.  Play to your civilization's strengths and you will win."
28884,This game is ridiculously fun. My brother introduced me to it years ago and it is still one of my favorite games. I love the game play and the expansions are fun too! It also sucks up tons of hours but that is part of why it's so great.
28885,"Mad game, check out Vox Populi for an extra expansion!"
28886,Amazing. You will lose all track of time trying to do just one more thing
28887,.
28888,tis good
28889,Its big fun
28890,"I absolutely love this game.
Want to be peaceful and diplomatic?  You can do that!
Want to just take over the world and dominate everyone?  You can do that too!
Don't really care about either of those and just want to go with Science?  Do it!"
28891,"I've logged over 1000 hours in this game, just in singleplayer; the game is relatively easy to pick up but has surprising depth, allowing for both fast casual play and serious mastery. It's addictively fun on its own, and the easy-to-access workshop content extends the game's already tremendous replayability to near-endless levels. There's a reason many consider this game to be the peak of the genre-defining Civilization series."
28892,very fun
28893,Incredible game for people who want to take their time and enjoy a game instead of rushed scenarios. Great for history and loads of fun to play.
28894,Masterpiece of a game. Best Civ ngl
28895,"This game is such a joy, especially playing the Marathon Time with a civ from ancient period. I recomend some mods to keep things balanced for these long plays, It's really frustrating when you are soooooooo in front of the other AI players. Favorite Civs are Germans, Romans, English, Dutch and the Shoshone"
28896,"Unbelievable amounts of replayability and the dlc is well priced for the value of the gameplay. The more friends you play with, the more fun it becomes. I cannot rate this game highly enough as turn-based strategy goes. The only thing I really hate is that they decided to disable crossplay between Windows and ios recently, meaning you cannot play with your friends who own a mac. Otherwise, absolutely no complaints."
28897,Massive time-sink. I've put way too many hours into this game and still love it. Expect other aspects of your life to suffer :D
28898,Good game for puzzle and story lovers
28899,I loved it amazing game
28900,good
28901,I'm deeply in love with this exelent game
28902,Excellent strategy game.

28904,Very fun game have had a lot of fun playing with friends wish online wasnt so glitchy tho :'(
28905,"I don't know if its steam or K2, the game keeps crashing while I'm playing and it does it when I try to load a saved game. I've played a lot CIV games but on the CD and had no issues with any of them, so I don't know what to say but the game is great but I don't recommend to download it on steam and go buy yourselves a real CD copy from somewhere."

28916,"Civ V holds a special place in my heart, Ive had it for the longest time and have been playing ever since 2016ish when it was on sale for 10 bucks. I never was into RTS's but Civ is that exception. The game's mechanics and game play, while not overly complicated, give you a load of leniency towards how you want to play the game. Want to be an intellectual player? CULTURE BAYBEE. Domination? JAPAN EMPIRE HERE WE COME. Time Boy? Looks like this game will never end. You can almost play this game the way you truly want to. And it doesnt even really need high end hardware to run too. Civ V, youre the best. As for Civ VI, wellllll.....
9/10
Dummy enjoyable"
28917,Very fun and addictive. Good with friends and singleplayer.
28918,So fun
28919,good!
28920,"I'd like to preface this by saying that I typically avoid games styled like Civilization 5. I don't find the combat style engaging enough despite enjoying resource management/simulation games. That said, Civilization 5 blew me away. The combat is RTS, but I found it very enjoyable that there were numerous ways to win the game and that focusing on combat can be sometimes detrimental. At the the end of the day, Civ 5 is about decision making and resource management. How do you plan to make your Civ thrive? Have a cultural renaissance? Do it! Eliminate all evil dicatorships? Definitely! Forcefully spread your religion around the world until every dark corner is secretly yours? You sly sly devil, you.  

Civ 5 not only offers incredible strategy in terms of city/army building. There is an equal amount of detail put into the map design. You can play on tiny maps against a small amount of Civs, or you can go all the way up to a globular map with around 16 Civs. There are rivers, hills, forests, natural wonders (Great barrier reef, Mt. Fuji, etc..), oceans, etc... And every environment has an effect on your nearby Civs or Units. Hands down the most addictive & equally challenging RTS/Strategy game that I have played since X-Com 2.

I have around 30 hours of gaemplay around the time of writing this review and I undoubtedly plan on investing even more time. Then, I'll dive into the mods. I mean, who wouldn't want to go to war against Emperor Paplatine? 

Gameplay: 9/10
Replayability: 9/10

P.S. I've never encountered a single noticeable bug/error/crash"
28921,Better than version 6.
28922,"The game is fun!  Be prepared to become a fan.  When I can carve out 4 hours, I play off and on most of the day!  It is a great stress reducer and history lesson, as well."
28923,"best strat game to play with friends, cannot reccomend more"
28924,"Epic. Many combinations of paths and starts you can play. However, the paths generally just merged into one for me most times."

28931,Civ 5 is probably the best game in the series. The expansions are basically required though.
28932,It's Civ.  It's a great game.
28933,One word: Mods
28934,It's fun.
28935,Yeah it's fun. I mean come on. Very addicting. There's a few quirks here and there but it's a classic.
28936,this shit gu cuh
28937,"This game exlempfies the meaning of a ruler. Never in a game, have I felt the power of dictation, the moment i settle my first city is the moment i become a powerful being. The realism hits a cord in my mind with the right amount of zing. I was immediately sucked into the vortex of the game as i couldnt shut my laptop. I was addicted. I started to dream of the characters and it was getting bad. I started to realize i am the game. I went out in the streets of real life and settled my city, and started sending scouts out to the lands. I will never forget chances grip on my mental being, he had me locked. If you are reading this please help, Chance Allen Jackson has me locked. I need help. This is not a joke. Please help me"
28938,i love this game you can do so many things like build a city and fight foes
28939,great game

28961,This is peak Civilization. 10 years old and still great.
28962,"The achievement for beating the game as Ghandi is called ""give peace a chance"". SOMEBODY hasn't played any of Civilizations 1-4."
28963,Be prepared to sacrifice your life to this excellent game. It takes hours and hours to play. Your back will hurt. Your eyes will hurt. And you'll want to play just.. one.. more.. turn!
28964,I really like this game
28965,Good game. Better with tacos.
28966,Civ is savory
28967,Great game
28968,Very addictive game play. It's so fun that I can't play it often for the fear that I won't come off it. The AI are very well programmed and the mod community is still up and going! Have fun!
28969,Big companies make enough money from us. It is time for us to support indie developers OR big companies that doesn't sell our private information. I will not spend another penny in a game involved by 2K. These corporations should not find any more courage to make such grotesque moves.

I will never forget the day we built the pyramids on a grassland hill, or who could forget when we used mega death robots to destroy the incan empire for trying to convert our cities to Confuciacism. 10/10."

28991,so good
28992,Best Civ game imo.

However, I have been raped by 2K, as after I have bought this steaming pile of poop, I was ready to unlock the DLC so I could actually experience the game. Then, I went and looked on the store, and there is no reasonable way for me to purchase any of the overpriced DLC alone. Again, I have been raped."

My little computer, an IBM Clone with an NEC 4D Monitor (Sony Trinitron Screen) has just finished loading Sid Meier's game, ""Civilization"" from these diminutive 3.5"" floppies.  I click Start New Game and fall in love. Now playing Civ V with the same enthusiasm, and I am only 29 years older.  MicroProse and Sid Meier, with Bruce Shelley, created a wealth of great games and I have always been a fan.  With Civ V I enjoy the evolution of a fantastic game that continues to hold a fresh feeling in playing it, no matter that it is the millionth time or the 5th time into the imaginary world of strategy, scientific development, diplomacy and the intrigue of political treachery.  I really like this version of a great franchise, therefore I am slow to grab Civ VI.  ""Just one more turn . . ."""

I do really crave a worthy military adversary, which is a very rare situation to find yourself in. The AI almost gives up after an initial pointless offensive is repulsed, then countered."
29075,I can no longer play a game i paid for? WTF
29076,"Absolutely 100% play this absolute gem of a game. Best Civ game by far, best strategy game by far, and one of the best games ever made. Very few issues. This game is such a treat if you are a history fan, as great leaders and military units that have become iconic come together in an all out battle to be the greatest nation in history. It's all about putting these well known, historically rich civilizations in new situations and it's breathtaking. The Greek Hoplites and Persian Immortals, Napolean and Queen Elizibeth, Alexander the Great, George Washington, Gengas Khan--the possibilities are endless. I will never grow tired of building the city of Honalulu in the arctic circle, or culturally influencing Atilla the Hun with pop music. These moments are unforgetable and can only happen in the Civilization Series--and my vote goes to the 5th entry as the greatest one."
29077,"its good

29078,Honestly i dont even have any dlcs besides the mongolia one.

29100,"It's good, steam fucked up though and I had to re-download..."
29101,"Most fun with friends, you'll need a LONG time to finish a match, so set aside a week or 2"
29102,played it for a few thousand hours its alright i guess. Better play a few thousand more just to be sure.
29103,"tldr: fun but more linear than other reviewers make it seem.

it's a decent game. do i recommend it? yes. will i play it much in the future? probably not for a number of reasons.

1) the game is honestly pretty linear. there are ideal ""research"" upgrades based on where you first settle.
2) lots of clicking ""next turn"" for the first couple of hours of starting your civilization
3) once your civilization gets pretty big and you start dominating other civilizations and other city states, the game becomes pretty tedious. there's just so much to manage that turns become annoying.
4) military conflict is pretty simple and linear. i found a recipe for success that seems to be unbeatable when trying to conquer other territories. build warriors/riflemen/etc (etc means whatever their corresponding upgrades are) as the front-line because they are the most balanced in terms of offense and defense, and then at least 2 siege units (catapults/trebuchet/canons/artillery is when it gets really OP because they can attack one more unit away), and just lay siege to your enemy.

honestly this game is fun and somewhat challenging. it's fun to see your civilization grow. it's fun to see your workers improve the land/territory you have within your civilization's territorial influence/reach. but other than that there really isn't much in the game. i give it a 6/10 which is low and maybe does not deserve a recommendation, but i still enjoyed/enjoy it."
29104,civ 5 is a great game its like putting 3 to 5 together.

29115,good game
29116,I would not recommend this game to anyone. Not sure what changed with the game since i last played it. But now i keep finding tiles that you can't improve. Builders just wack away at it for a turn or two and then stop. I tried using other units but still the same thing happened. I would understand them stopping if you had enemy units near by. But there was none.

Ever since I started playing, it has been one of the most fun games I have ever played. For many years, it had the most playtime on my Steam account, as well, due to how much fun I was having, and my want to keep earning as many of the achievements as I could. Each game always presents new challenges, and I keep striving to learn and adapt to each new challenge as best as I can. I definitely recommend Civ V, even if someone has not played any of the other Civ games."

29132,the way it plays I like it better than civilization 6
29133,"One of those games where you say ""Just one more turn"" then you check the clock and it's three in the morning and you're conquering the world. It sucks you in, and time flies. Not recommended for those who only want to play games for an hour. Highly Recommended for those who have a veg day and want something to do."
29134,One.......more.......turn..........

29175,Probably the best strategy game ever
29176,.
29177,yes
29178,Slow based but excellent. Easy to lose hours and hours into this game.
29179,"Fun mechanics, great modding, nuke ghandi before he can nuke you/10"
29180,Much better than CIV VI
29181,Grand Strategy Masterpiece
29182,yes
29183,YES!
29184,This game scratches the wargaming itch for me and is really easy to dump 10 hours into without realizing it. One of my favorite games of all time.
29185,"I don't really have much to say about this game other than it's an all-around good game. This game introduces brand new content and ideas while still managing to stick to the old feel of games like Civ 4 (my personal favorite of the whole franchise). I only have two complains about this game: I feel that naval units per era are lacking quite a bit when compared to older games, and I still don't understand why religion is not a thing in this game."
29186,good game
29187,Replayable.
29188,Games kicks the butt. All of the butt.
29189,Epic

29205,My Favorite of the Civ Games
29206,it slaps
29207,"personally, my favorite civ game. although I do understand that the release of the game and dlc is a point of contention among some, with the dlc completing the product. this is currently my favorite civ game (and that's including civ 6 vanilla)"
29208,10/10 with friends
29209,Good game can get lost for hours.
29210,It's Civ.  It's the game you play between games.  A palette cleanser game.  That isn't a knock against it.  It's a ton of fun.
29211,With Almost 740 hours i must say that civilization has been a favorite of mine since i was a kid. Its endlessly entertaining.
29212,"hours of entertainment, not every run through is the same."
29213,"the depth of the diplomacy in this one is one of its greatest strengths.  I felt they really dumbed down that aspect of play in part 6, and i still like this one better for that reason."
29214,Really fun
29215,Its fun with a friend
29216,"Haven't played the newest version yet because this one hasn't even started to bore me. I enjoy the large amount of civs available through the expansions and still find myself coming back to this game. Maybe I just don't like change? Even then I quite enjoyed Civ III. Neither is better per se though people have their preferences. Much like frosted shredded wheat versus plain. Some people find the sugar just too much. I wonder what flavor Civ VI is? No matter, I am happy with my bowl, as it were."
29217,"I stayed up to 3 in the morning because I wanted to get my civilization to space travel before I go to bed. 

Pretty good game."

-1 star because there are a few issues, minor bugs that are still present.  And performance is pretty demanding."
29241,"played a bit, really enjoying this game!"
29242,yes
29243,"Worth the money, hours of my life taken by this game :^)"
29244,"I absolutely love this game. It is, in my opinion, the best game to have ever existed. I feel like a god when I play this, which suits by arrogant nature perfectly. If you aren't into controlling all aspects of a civilization's destiny, then I don't recommend this game. On the other hand, if you are a fellow god trapped in mortal flesh, then I would most certainly recommend this game. 5 Stars"
29245,10/10 NQ/TakMod Needed
29246,is good game
29247,"You can play any way you want - if you want to spend the whole game fighting other countries, you can.  If you want to concentrate on science and building, you can."
29248,Good old CIV

29253,The game is  stronger than opium based drugs currently available and it's not even close.
29254,Great Game!!
29255,Addictive to the point where I don't want to play it because it consumes so much of my time.
29256,"Civ V is the best empire building game ever created. It is a must have for any PC gamer's library and is consistently my go to game. Unlimited replay value and intricate and engaging mechanics. Fun for beginners and seasoned players, from hour one, to however many hours I've logged by now."
29257,abc
29258,This is a good and adictive game. it only has 2 problems. don't play the earth map and it is slighty hard to lear. but you will get the hang off it!
29259,"Strateji sevenler için ideal.
"
29260,"Pros:
* Great Strategy Game
* Great replayability
* Full game can be purchased for cheap ($12)
* Has lots of depth to it. It is by no means a ""shallow"" game.
* Lots of fun to play with friends.

Cons:
* Starting the game can be difficult. I recommend watching some youtube videos to get a good grasp on the basics. You might have a very bad time otherwise. 
"
29261,Easily one of the best strategy/turn based games I ever have played.
29262,"I've been saying ""just one more turn"" for 10 years. Now that I also own Civ VI, I find myself saying ""just one more game on Civ V"".

Civilization manages to make the grand strategy/4x genre simple enough for anyone to understand, without losing the nuance and scale that make grand strategy/4X games epic. The core gameplay is addicting, the expansions make exciting and high quality improvements to the game, and the amount of excellent mods created by the community is endless. If you're a strategy gamer, Civ V is a must buy."
29263,They ruined it with the last update for mac as i now can no longer play any one using windows. Just comes up with an error - version mismatch. All i ever used the game for was mac to windows multiplayer which always worked seamlessly until a recent update November 2019. Ruined it as i now can't play with my mate. Very disappointing. :(
29264,Complete. well thought out...classic!!
29265,good game
29266,"Just a fun go to game to relax and play,"
29267,eh is ok
29268,"This game is everything I've been looking for! The domination part, fucking brilliant! I love that I can have full control over my cities. I especially love the part that I can denounce other civilizations. It's like waltzing into their main hall and flipping them the bird. It's great!!!!"
29269,pogchamp game
29270,"its good
"
29271,"Unforunately I do not like Civ VI due to loyality mechanism.  Folks on social media say don't blame the game if you aren't willing to learn the rules/model.  That way of thinking is contrary to what I believe to be a good game.  In my opinion Civ VI may be a better simulator, but not a better game.  I wish the loyality mechanism can be easily turned off, but this is not what I have found as the version I have installed crashes with a mod that attempts to turn of the mechansim.  I return to Civ V which I very much enjoying playing."
29272,It's alright I guess
29273,"A classic turn-based strategy game that encapsulates the feeling of ""grand strategy"" and progression from the dawn of civilization to clashes between superpowers. Highest recommendation."
29274,"it was fun
"
29275,Good game.
29276,Favorite game ever.
29277,"It's good, so yeah."

Graphics are delicious and smooth, runs perfectly.

Game play varies in a good way, that there is a lot of decisions you can make and it can shift the whole game."

29294,Fun
29295,It is q challenge to work out the winning strategies. Even after you have worked them out the game does not give in easily. Also great fun to play with others not just the AIs.
29296,Ghandi fucks you up real talk
29297,The amount of hours says it all. I love this game.

29306,If you are considering buying civ 6 buy this instead
29307,"Possibly the best iteration of Sid Meier's classic Civilization franchise. I'd highly recommend to anyone interested in RTS or resource management games as there is enough of both and a robust tech tree to make any scenario fun and interesting. If it's on sale, buy it!"

29324,Excellent game.  Steals my time though.
29325,"Don't believe the lies of the media, this game is better than Civ VI."
29326,Good Game Solid Amount of content ive played like 10x my hours offline

29329,Better game than 6
29330,Very very good game.

29340,"I got into the game as a recommendation from a friend and boy have I enjoyed it. I'm pretty bad at it, but it's still immensely enjoyable, and the extensive modding community means there is an infinite replay value. You should probably get Civ 6 instead, but this is still a great game"
29341,10/10 would waste my precious time again
29342,yes

sid 5
aye
sound

like if funny review ahahah"
29354,"So, I haven't played a Civilization game since IV. But i dare say this is the best time I've had with a game in a while. Granted, I've only been playing 7hrs so far! I highly recommend getting it if you want a relaxing game that will still get you on your toes. This game makes me think pretty intensely on some strategies.. Word of warning look out for Gandhi he can not be trusted. 10/10 will always recommend."
29355,Not as good as CIV3 but still good.
29356,Still more playable than Civ 6.
29357,I guess it's fun...
29358,With all DLC-s it is fun! So far i've tried community mods as well and that makes it even more fun!
29359,"Everybody says ""gandhi nuked me"". 
He can't if you nuke him first."
29360,"Probably one of the best turn-strategy games I have ever played. Highly recommendable! You can play online, offline and offline with a few friends in the same computer. Make sure you get all the expansions!"
29361,"Really great game. Period. I never stop learning new quirks. I don't always win but when I win I feel like I got three cookies instead on one. When I loose, I know why. If you have time, it is a fun way to waste it.
"
29362,I prefer Civ V it seems more well developed but I wonder if it would be possible to include a random event like an earthquake or maybe a volcanic eruption.  such events to affect how a civilization develops or fails to develop.  Another idea now that we are spit balling how about the effect on civilization of say a plague or the introduction of climatic changes
29363,l
29364,Great game and I particular enjoy being able to play alone in my spare time against the computer.  Lots of challenges and different ways to play so every game can be different.
29365,"Great NVIDIA 3D game, I love Civ and Civ in 3D is perfection."
29366,It's just good.
29367,Good stoof
29368,"Better than civ 6. It's fun by yourself, but way better if you can get a group of 2+ friends to play with you. Also DLC makes the game 99999 times better."
29369,goat game
29370,"After playing nearly 200 hours of this game, I can honestly say it is one of my favorites. A game with seemingly endless possibilities in many different aspects leads to a completely new experience each time you play. As someone who loves history it is great fun to take control of my favorite ancient civilizations and bring them past their former glory. I enjoy this game incredibly more than almost all other games. making this game, and this series, in my top pics for years to come!"
29371,"This game is so perfect that, for recreational play, I'm not really motivated to try anything else.  Even Civ VI..."
29372,"Always build great library first to fuck matt
"
29373,Addictive!
29374,"i like it
"
29375,Takes a very long time to play and is not satisfying at all.
29376,"This has so many delightful elements associated with the progression of civilization that has either been missing from or was inadequate in other Civ incarnations that it is well worth the price tag.  I have played the newer version (Civilization 6) and this still completely blows away the new game.  Just the introduction of ideologies to the government structures and how you can completely shape the destiny of your people and your country is enough to try this game.  The graphics are incredible and there are so many mods that can be used to enhance game play that, if you've been on the fence about purchasing it for yourself, don't wait any longer.  Trust me...this is definitely the best of the Sid Meier's series!"
29377,it good
29378,"The  game that needs no introduction. If you're reading this, you already know you should play it."
29379,"I am writing this review after only one game and can already tell it is going to be one of my favorites from here on out.

The first point I want to make about this game is, you will find when you start playing, it is super easy to get sucked in and lose track of time. That means if you need to do something before a deadline, make sure you finish that before playing this game or the chances are you will completely forget about your project and miss the deadline completely!

There are a few things that I really enjoyed about this game, but my favorite thing about it so far is that it’s simple enough to play without memorizing the tutorial and  learn as you play, but at the same time complex enough that I'm sure I’ll still be learning new tactics many games into the future. 

The gameplay itself is very smooth, and because it’s a turn-based game, there is no rush and I can take my time to read what each technology does and how to use it to crush my AI opponents. On the other hand, there were times that I would rush to the next turn to see what would happen next!

For my first game I played as George Washington on difficulty level two, and even though I was entire ages ahead of the enemy AI, there were still some intense skirmishes that made the game fun and challenging even when your civilization is years ahead of everyone else’s. That made winning the game even more rewarding, plus it made me feel like a boss dropping a few nukes on the last of my enemy cities for the win while they are still in the Renaissance era.

I can already tell the game already has tons of ways to play, and I have barely scratched the surface. On top of that, there are numerous DLCs out there that add to this already huge game! I will be likely purchasing a few those DLCs sometime in the near future, but right now there is still so much more to explore in the base game! 

Another huge aspect of the game is that it has multiplayer capabilities! I have not explored the multiplayer gameplay as I am still a big noob and don’t want to die instantly, but just the fact there is a turn-based strategy a game like Civilization V that is multiplayer is insane to me and I will defiantly be checking that out later! 
 
In conclusion, this game is awesome, and I think it is defiantly worth the thirty dollars I paid for it! I highly recommend purchasing this game to anyone who likes playing turn-based strategy games and of course has enough time to play it.

29380,i uh... i think i have too many hours in this game.....

"
29385,"Sid Meier's Civilization V is a true timeless gem. It's one of those games you can keep coming back to and still enjoy it, especially with the numerous mods that keep the gameplay fresh and enjoyable."
29386,"I like grand strategy games in general, but this game makes this genre appealing for almost everyone. You can go all-out attack, or just try to build up a civlization filled with wonders. 

The game really has that ''just one more turn'' vibe"
29387,wait are we already recording?
29388,"It's like Monopoly and Risk combined into the ultimate board game, which was then perfectly adapted to a video game. It takes about as long, too."

29401,"In my opinion this is currently the best Civ game. I'm sure once all the DLC releases for 6 it will be a more whole and complete experience, but as of December of 2019, I still prefer V."
29402,good
29403,The game is fun and aside from the AI not having a well developed sense of logic the game is fun. You will be betrayed.
29404,Best Strategy game ever made for PC
29405,"Just the best, got me hooked on strategy games."
29406,tis good
29407,"Pretty good, the nukes are pretty chill"
29408,yes
29409,"The game in my opinion is more realistic than civ 6. And i really like the multiple mods that people have made for this game. There are so many ways to play this game and overall i think this is better than civ 6 (remember, only my opinion)."
29410,kinna hot
29411,Very fun and relaxing game
29412,Just a really fun game. Relatively simple and quick to be picked up.
29413,"Wait! Just... one... more... turn...
.
.
.
This game is way too addictive."
29414,building and then destroying all
29415,The best strategy game I ever played!
29416,-
29417,I'm pretty sure that 720 hours speak for themselves...
29418,Best strategy game I have ever played.  Age of Empires 2 is a close second.
29419,Classic game with lots of variables.
29420,I've been playing this game for years and it's practically perfect.
29421,gooooood
29422,Excellent game! Upvote.
29423,"Good game man, one of the chillest games ive ever played no other game has beaten it man."
29424,10/10 for sure
29425,"Best CIV game ever.
Best game ever probably."
29426,#justonemoreturn
29427,"One of the greatest strategy games of all time. I really love the world wars that can be made in this, the game is also pretty."
29428,Just started playing this yesterday.  I finally managed to turn it off at 5am after realizing I need to be up in a few hours.  I'd avoid this game if you have anything else useful you need to do with you life.  :)
29429,"This game is simply incredible! I am a brand new player and found the game to challenging but nothing a new player couldn't learn with a little bit of reading and patience. If you are a new player and wanting to get into the Civ games then I cannot recommend a better starting place than this game, it is awesome and you won't regret the purchase. Don't be discouraged, I was hesitant at first to play a game such as Civ 5 but I do not in anyway regret buying this masterpiece. Good luck ruler! Remember to be wary of your neighbors, not all are out for peace. See ya!"
29430,"I've played civ for about as long as i remember playing computer games at all. 
Going from civ 3 to civ 5 was a jarring jump at first, I didn't like it. I thought it added too much choice and required you to get your hands in the nitty gritty to really have a good time and i didn't enjoy that.
However, that's not the case. You very much have the option to get your hands quite amongst the details in this game and that's a fantastic feature, but you can also take a back seat to most of that and play with those options on an autopilot of sorts and it really doesn't take away from the game. it still plays out smoothly and enjoyably, and you can at any time dip your toes into the advanced options this game presents you.
Coming from an earlier version (which probably isn't a problem for anyone nowadays) this seemed like a game for someone who was an expert at the earlier stuff and who wanted more. And it is, but it is also a game for beginners and amateurs alike. I am strictly a casual player and enjoy my time with this game entirely. 
If you ever think this game could get boring, just take a peek at the mods. THE MODS. They never end.
This game never ends. 
You'll never play it out."
29431,fun and addicting
29432,greatest game of all time!
29433,Fun strategy game and especially fun when playing with friends. 10/10 would recommend.
29434,beep
29435,"Not the most recent Civ, but lots of replay value through scenarios and expansion. Highly recommend!"
29436,Despite how slowly this runs on my toaster if I start a game I'm glued to it until something forces me off or I fall asleep on the keyboard.
29437,:)
29438,yes
29439,Be weary of Gandhi
29440,"This has been a long time favorite of mine, this was the first game that I got on steam."
29441,its awesome
29442,good gam
29443,"Great game, still beats civ 6"
29444,Me likes
29445,This is the best version of Civilization in my opinion.  I play with all the expansions and I have put almost 2500 hours into this game.  Its a game you can literally always come back to and enjoy weather you are a seasoned or casual gamer.  I could write a report on why it is superior than Civ6 but I really don't want to waste the time.
29446,YES
29447,Yeah i've got time
29448,Tbh just get Civ 6. It isn't that much more and there is a lot more to do.
29449,"Day 1 of ownership: I'm confused as fuck, have no idea what I'm doing, and just trying to figure out the game.
Day 7 of ownership: I'm confused as fuck, have no idea what I'm doing, but now I know that Gandhi wants to nuke me.
Day 31 of ownership: I'm confused as fuck, have a vague idea of what I'm doing, and now I have nukes.
Now: Im confused as fuck, still vaguely know what I'm doing, and now I have mods and am at war with Guy Fieri of Flavortown."
29450,"My favorite CIV game of all times, and also one of the best resource management games"
29451,"fabulous game, well designed, better than Civ VI"
29452,i like da game hahah
29453,320 Hours in have yet to found a city.............
29454,Great game. Great mods.
29455,"I recommend the community balance patch, I probably wouldn't play it otherwise."
29456,I think this is an awesome turn based strategy game
29457,Never trust a Hun.
29458,great game
29459,Buy this game instead of Civ 6. Gameplay is amazing and it runs pretty good on my shit tier laptop
29460,"Play Native Americans, meet noone for centuries, suddenly meet 12 civs in the next century. Be nice guy, go for science victory without war. France is way ahead and should win, declare war on France. Hes kicking Native butt and producing only units to do it. Sneak science victory bc he's not building spaceship."
29461,"One of the best Civ games in my opinion. Nice UI, balanced gameplay: addicting."
29462,Well lets just say I played it a little and I will play it a bit more ;)
29463,I would sacrifice my wife and children for this game
29464,CIVS
29465,Civ 5 offers the best Civ experience
29466,"This is one of if not the best grand strategy ever created. It's very easy to pick up, impossible to master, and is very addictive. The themes and ways in which your civilization can progress is both immersive and addictive. Would highly recommend to anyone. Pretty reasonable system requirements as well.

As an aside: I haven't played Civ 6 yet, but my understanding is that it has for the most part caught up to Civ 5 with it's recent expansions.
"
29467,Lit game
29468,classic game perfect for spending some hours planning 1 invasion etc
29469,Tavsiye edilir
29470,"This is an amazing game. I love the gameplay and the fact that there are ways to win other than destroying everyone else. Games can get quite long, though. And AI isn't particularly good, but that's a given in strategy games..."
29471,"Legendary game... However one point I don't like about the AI is that they don't really change tactics, they just have some advantages. And after many hours you might also get bored because the map generated uses too easy principles, like we have tundra-forest-desert-jungle-desert-forest-tundra... Of course that isn't really a complaint, but sometimes it really sucks playing civ while being a geographer by education"
29472,"Yes, it is a based game"
29473,berry cool game
29474,its just so cool i love history and if you can sort through the shitty mods then you will find some cool ones.
29475,great fun and a good time sync
29476,"I have sunk so many hours into this game, and have enjoyed every second of it. I definitely recommend this to people over Civ VI anyday. (CIV V IS SUPERIOR IN EVERY WAY)"
29477,Great game with plenty of fresh replay opportunities.
29478,I come back to this game every 3 months since 2015. I just cant stop. ITS THAT GOOD
29479,"Had a lot of fun with befriending and waging wars against other civs. My favourite so far is America (Washington), England (Elizabeth) and Russia (Catherine). Everytime I play as America, I pick the Freedom Ideology in the Brave New World DLC and always go on a major mission to unite the entire world under one flag or a common goal like scientific or cultural victory. This is often very satisfying to manage to cause giant rebellions and uprisings in other civilizations when they pick Order or Autocracy Ideology. I strongly recommend you to buy it during sales though, the total cost of the game along with all the important DLCs(Gods and Kings + Brave New World) is very high, but even if you don't buy it during sales, it's still all worth it."
29480,"great game to spend the time :)

"
29481,"Great graphics, easier religion"
29482,Excellent startegy game
29483,destroy da city
29484,GOOD GAME

29486,eons better then civ 6 with dlc and mods
29487,"Excellent game, especially with the DLC and mods."
29488,Great Game
29489,Depth
29490,"This is a great game, one of the best of its genre.  However I really cannot believe they updated a functional launcher for a slower and less optimized one simply to aggressively advertise the sequel to you, so I have to give a protest thumbs down.  Great game, but the newer launcher takes longer to pull up and is less reliable.  Also I don't buy a product at this price point to be advertised to."
29491,i always find myself coming back to play this regardless of what other games may catch my eye. 10/10.
29492,Learn before you cheat. Youll be more successful in your world domination. 9.8/10
29493,Turgid.
29494,The pinnacle of strategy gaming!
29495,good game
29496,I just really like the game. I have played this game when t first came out in the 70's or 80's. So I have played for a very long time.
29497,Still arguably the best Civ game out there. I always come back to this one.
29498,I love this game. There are very few games with the replay-ability of Civ V. Can't recommend it enough.
29499,Great game
29500,"GREATEST GAME EVER
"
29501,It's pretty fun.
29502,one more turn...
29503,Great turn based game.  Different AI levels provides excellent play ability.  Very addictive.
29504,Played it for a short time. Liking it so far.
29505,"Better than Civ VI, still fun, especially with friends. Only negative is that you need all the dlc or it's boring af."
29506,ONE MORE TURN. Yeah this game is a bit addictive once you start a game.
29507,game good I like
29508,"dis good
"
29509,I play this game way more then I should and I have fun with or without my friends. Hours of enjoyment right here(I did this to get a badge).
29510,it good
29511,Sick Nasty. 66 hours and I've never won.
29512,"Great game overall, much preferable to 6.

Unfortunately, the latest ""Update"" was to push startup screen ads to the players.  Totally disrespectful, and I will be giving future games a hard pass."
29513,amazing game.
29514,I like all the CIV games but this one is my favorite. I would recommend this to anyone.
29515,best game I have played in a long time.  If I am able to play this for over 2000 hours than you will to trust me
29516,I've played quite a bit so If you are looking for a a civ game that is modern in the sense of features and graphics but still want the playstyle of an old civ game then this is for you hehe haha.
29517,"Massive turn based strategy game where you can try so many totally different ways to win and you can't really trust anyone. You also need to select which civilisation to play as they have very different attributes. I always play the largest game option, and start by deciding what I need to build and research immediately based on what assets are visible at the outset. One of the interesting aspects is that if you save a starting point so that you can replay several times from the same location, the other civilisations can be different every time, so the games are totally different each time.
If you like working out how to win, this game can test you."
29518,pretty cool I guess
29519,i love it it is a great way to pass time
29520,"AN enjoyable, deep game with multiple play-styles that fit any player.  A great starting point for anyone interested in a strategy game!"
29521,:)
29522,zjn6 TEGA
29523,Great game! I am a long time Civ player and really enjoy the feel of the games!
29524,Just enjoy the challenge
29525,It's freakin incredible there's nothing else quite like it
29526,Any game where it is normal to be nuked by a globally recognized pacifist is a good game.
29527,i just like the game
29528,So many games.....so little time.
29529,its good just buy it nerds

29546,I really enjoyed this one. Some bugs that require a patches but that can be overlooked.
29547,"Great game, ive had weeks of losing myself in it"
29548,"Got them good memes, and fun game play best of all the civ games."
29549,This is the best Civ game. Civ 6 is crap. Don't waste your time on anything more than Civ 5
29550,Excellent strategy game with many paths to victory.
29551,657 hours played so far and still going strong. What more can I say?
29552,Love this game and the series. More recently have found myself choosing this game over its sequel.
29553,"The Civilization franchise will take over your life. I've played since the early days and it's an excellent game.
It's always been overpriced with oversold upgrades. Wishlist Civ5 and wait for the occasional sale."
29554,its fun
29555,Just one more turn
29556,"fun to play,can be as difficult or easy as you want"
29557,is veri good yes
29558,fun game

29567,I played it a bit
29568,A darn good game
29569,its a good way to chew up spare time
29570,Its late at night- you have a test tomorrow. One more turn.
29571,it's pretty epic
29572,"Great game that you can spend hours playing then realize its 6am and you need to get just 1 more turn in then ends up being 8am and realizing theres no point in going to sleep anymore because so its so late. Making you repeat the cycle until eventual Psychosis from sleep deprivation, Lit"
29573,Better than 6
29574,"Is good. Works in Ubuntu-Mate 18.04.3 with Nvidia Drivers. Using native, not proton."
29575,undoubtedly addicting
29576,New civ system. I like it.
29577,"This game can be pretty confusing when you first start, If you are playing this game for the first time I suggest looking for a guide online or play with people who have played this game before"
29578,Great game!
29579,"good game yes. very good must get. aquire always. Much play good plays.

29583,good strategy good.
29584,"Good
"
29585,Each game is different.  Not some some of those other war games.  You can pick the way you want to win based on what you can do with what you have.
29586,h
29587,"I am not a gamer, but this game hooked me from the first day. I have put in 300 hours and learn something new every game. It is fun for nongamers and for those who are deeply invested in learning nooks and crannies."
29588,"is good game, lots of tactics, great if you have a lot of time, normal games do often take hours to finish"
29589,Its dope.
29590,Pretty good Game
29591,well worth your time over and over and over. The best Civ game of them all
29592,I enjoy it since it has great graphics and you have multiple ways to win.
29593,"Great game, well built, polished, makes sense. Less resorse intensive than you might think, holds up very well with time. If you want somethings that makes you think without being crazy complex, this is the one."
29594,"This game stands the test of time.  My husband and I have Civ VI and so much of the detail has been taken out of it that we gave it up and came back to Civ V.  I currently have 2200+ hours logged on this game.  It's insanely addictive, co-op which we love, and has so much customization and detail that--even when you get bored after a few weeks--you will always come back to it after a break and be into it for weeks at a time all over again.  100% recommend!"
29595,"good strategy game, like EU4"
29596,It's a pretty fun game
29597,verry good
29598,You know Civ games rock. Love the point and click for PC.
29599,Fantastic Game with plenty of replay value

29605,"A great game with an ability to replay for many years. Seriously, if you like strategy games and history, then it's worth playing this one. On top, it's music changes along with each civilisation, while the various difficult levels mean that you never face the same difficulties..."
29606,"schallert, besser als civ 6 #nohate #realtalk

gang shit"
29607,Still better than VI.
29608,"One of the best turn-based strategy or 4x games I've played or seen. It has easy to grasp features and concepts, but also some that take more playtime to understand, although once you do it's an even bigger blast. Managing cities, an economy, populations, military units, etc. gives you plenty to do in a game. Where this game really shines is when real humans take the place of the AI leaders. Playing against real opponents gives this game near endless replayability. If you're a history nerd or just want to manage and shape an empire then this one's for you."
29609,great game
29610,Highly addictive.
29611,Yes.
29612,"It's alright
"
29613,I'm 2 hours away from 500 hours put into this game...I think I need help
29614,"Cool game
"
29615,good
29616,"One of the best games ever designed ... they keep trying to make a better game and they fail every time.  Mostly because the don't understand that the faux simplicity, and sense of accomplishment is what makes this one work.  No game is ever the same, making the replay value infinite."
29617,"nice holokaust 9/11
"
29618,"If you love turn-based strategy games, then this is the game for you."
29619,"My favorite game of all time, fun with friends or by yourself with bots. Be prepared to invest a lot of time into this, it's worth it."
29620,Best Civ game bar none.
29621,It goes without saying but it is a quality attention holding game.
29622,
29623,Spent some time to figure out how to play this game and liked it.
29624,"I used to love this game but the developer is making you use their launcher which causes it to crash and it seems they have no interest in fixing it no matter how many tickets have been sent to them by me and others in the community. 
"
29625,Its held up over the years
29626,"A great game that you can sink hours in without realizing it. Perfect to play with a group of friends or by yourself on a lazy Sunday. The civilizations are all unique and interesting, and the options for set up are limitless. You are missing out if you've never played Civ 5."
29627,10/10 would accidentally nuke myself again.
29628,very good
29629,Just Immerse Yourself Ask Questions Later. Amazing Game
29630,Great game
29631,It's perfect
29632,"Great game, very replayable strategy game both for casual and more serious play. Best played with friends."
29633,"Love the game, hate the music that comes with it. Which they would remove the music."
29634,excellent game that can be played and set aside then picked up again. doesn't force you to stay in the game.  Good graphics and nothing inappropriate for younger ages. Highly recommend it.
29635,deep game with a rich workshop.

29649,nice
29650,"Crashes a bit too often. Otherwise fun. Can't enjoy it in present state.
Usually it crashes when starting a new game, think it is related to first time I get advice.
When I got past that part, it crashed many turns later, have no good idea of what does that.

29657,lost 3 friendships 10/10 IGN
29658,The way the game's systems are intertwined just tickle me pink.
29659,Probably the best turn-based-strategy game ever made.
29660,Best game with friends at a LAN or late night chill sessions <3
29661,Be a dictator? Ya that's up my alley
29662,total rip off... played for 882 hours and what did i get from it? diabetus
29663,This game is by far the best out of the series and I would say this game is perfect for people starting this kind of game.
29664,Fun and addictive turn based strategy game
29665,Gameplay is versatile except at high levels.  Artwork and sound files high quality both in resolution and composition.

29668,"One of the greatest, most addictive, highest quality, re-playable games of all time.  If you've ever played any Civilization game, this one tops them all.  A true masterpiece of gaming."
29669,super fun
29670,this game is way better than the new version civilization VI because the way the game looks and how it is played.
29671,Just one more turn...
29672,good game.
29673,By Far the best Civ 5 game around. The mechanics are completely flushed out and superb.
29674,"Yes, with the Vox Populi mod."
29675,"I have plated this game consistently since 2012. It was the first game I played on steam and it is my most played game. This game with a group of friends that are interested in strategy can turn into one of the funniest and most entertaining games out there with deception, teamwork, and physiological warfare. Couldnt recommend it enough."
29676,10/10 amazing game played 500+ hours lets get it
29677,Easy to learn gameplay
29678,its a good game genuinely good however buy civ 3 or civ 4 they are generally better

29680,epic....
29681,good
29682,it's fun
29683,The Best Turn based Game !
29684,"Incredibly complex and deep, wonderful game to play if you enjoy strategy and looking at the world in new ways."
29685,I have played roughly 400+ hours of this game and I still love it.
29686,This game is very enjoyable
29687,"One of the Best Classic Games of Civ Nation with Forever playing power.  Civ V will stand the test of time long after Civilizations have reached past X and beyond!  Highly Recommended, even if this is your first endeavor for a Civ game!"
29688,"I've been playing Civ since before I had kids. Now they've mostly grown up and I am still finding time to squeeze in the 100+ hours I need per game. I don't also play strategy games, but when I do it's Civ!"
29689,"By far the best Civ game after 3, although the diplomatic AI isn't great (still better than 6) and for some reason large parts of the map never get settled."
29690,LOVE THIS GAME. FUCK ALL THE OTHERS.
29691,Played it for a bit... its alright...
29692,Best Civ game and turn based game ever!
29693,Civilization 5 is infinitely better than 6; it is more intuitive and the variety within its DLC creates a much more enjoyable experience even if 6 appears newer and flashier.
29694,The most epic and fun Civilization game up to date. This is after playing Beyond Earth and 6. This is the best turn-by-turn based game. I have over 8000 hours and counting.
29695,Wonderful game for relaxing
29696,this game is so sick
29697,It's just a classic.
29698,"It ain't no Civ 4 but it'll do pig, it'll do"
29699,one of the greatest strategy games of all time. Once you start playing this game you'll never stop! So worth the price!
29700,Oldie but Goldie.
29701,"I love getting badges. But this game is as complex as you want to make it, lots of options, lots of scenarios. It can be historical or just random. Almost educational."
29702,fun
29703,"Civ 5 is a game that takes a very long time to play. I recommend it, but you better have friend otherwise it is going to be really boring."
29704,I very much like this game. It is strategically taxing and I can't sit through a whole game in one go but it is fun in short bursts (of a few hours)
29705,good teim
29706,"I like the challenge, but I also think the computer generated players have too much of an advantage at too low a level.  They are always too far ahead of me in discoveries and piece propagation.  In other words, it seems like the computer is playing at the next difficulty level compared to my selected civilization."
29707,Still better than Civ 6
29708,good
29709,This is a great games
29710,"Very Nice game!
"
29711,"A game in which you can, playing for any country, turn the whole world"
29712,"Плюсы: можно красить карту в разные цвета.
Минусы: искусственный разум очень пассивен до вкулючения максимальной сложности. Вариативности поведения не достаёт."
29713,#1 game. Bring back Assyria in all Civ releases
29714,its good
29715,this was lit before Civ 6
29716,"Amazing game, I have spent so many hours on it and it's still just as fun as it was at the beginning. Infinite replay value, and although I didn't really know what I was doing to start off, stick with it and it'll be easy before long."
29717,This game is strategic and great.  You'll love it if you like strategy games.
29718,"super fun game, very addictive"
29719,Always a good time!  The gameplay is awesome!
29720,yeah good game actually
29721,Buy it
29722,it goo

29724,its a good game and is able to be put down and then picked right up again
29725,fun
29726,hi
29727,"Awesome game.

You start to play and then 10 hours later .. ""hold up, did I just played all day ?"".

9/10

Only problem: AI are a bit dumb"
29728,"Always have loved Civ since the very beginning. V is great, still playing it even though I own VI"
29729,"I've always liked the Civilization series. I've tried Civ VI several times, but I'm not a huge fan. The newer approach to city development in Civ Vi is interesting, but most days I favor a simpler approach such as that in Civ V."
29730,"pretty good so far, but india is sus"
29731,yes
29732,good
29733,Really good content
29734,"when I start the game...... oh, what time is it?"
29735,i recommend
29736,good game
29737,Superior graphics to Civ VI.
29738,"It's cicilization, what more can be said... been playing this game ever since the original edition, more than 20 years now :-)"
29739,"Nuclear Ghandi...
That's all you need to know.

Also needs NQMOD/LEKMOD after a while, gives the game more quality gameplay and balance."
29740,been playing since 1986. rad game.
29741,"great game, excellent to play with friends."
29742,Its civ
29743,It's alright
29744,To chase the day away. The mods bring this to life.
29745,"It's just a fun way to build an empire, giving the player a plethora of different options to do so. It is a much more immersive world building sim as opposed to say something like Sims."
29746,very nice
29747,It's good.
29748,"An absolute classic! This game is well worth your money and has amazing replay value. Along with steam workshop and the DLC, there is so much to do with this game. I highly recommend buying this if you haven't tried a Civ or turn-based strategy game yet. I prefer Civ 5 over Civ 6 and Beyond Earth. Those two you can skip in all honesty (I get some people might disagree but if I had to choose one game I would put it on 5 in a heartbeat). This game is great with or without others, single player bots play just fine too with scaling difficulties."
29749,"If you have 4-6 days of straight time to kill, it definitely is worth the time. I thoroughly enjoy playing this game. The attention to detail is amazing and the overall gameplay is addictive for me. I enjoy history more than the average person, my friends dont like the game the way i do. I like building armies and using strategy over throwing enemies at a wall over and over again.  It is a very time consuming game and it has a very large amount of information thrown at you at once. It takes time to understand the game and build of each civ. And while a few strategies are much stronger than others. Each one is viable to use for a specific form of victory."
29750,London built the great wall my border so me as the zulu ran over with artillery and tribesman and ran through there units 10/10 wakanda forever
29751,yaes
29752,"nuke funny, i laugh"
29753,one of the best games ever
29754,The only game where you blink once and it's 5AM
29755,It is the best strategy game of all time.
29756,"I mostly play the game with my brother in law and my sister. It's more fun than I expected, since I'm more of a console gamer and not at all a turn based strategy gamer. I can say I enjoy playing this game even when I'm not playing with my family members. Definitely recommend if you're open to trying turn based strategy games or if you enjoy TBS games. 8/10"
29757,its fun
29758,Excellent game for those who love strategy.  Plentiful options with many ways to win and lose.
29759,Fun game
29760,its fun
29761,"It's Civilization, Say good bye to your free time."
29762,Great game
29763,"Easy interface, lots of fun options. Great for casual play."
29764,it's okay
29765,"It is a very complex, multi-faceted, game and is therefore quite challenging.  I have played Civ from its early days and currently have VI, V, and VI on my computer.  I enjoy V the most, but find VI too challenging to be enjoyable most of the time."
29766,"Holy fucking shit, finally got a chance to play this and I can't even fucking get past turn 2 because the mother fucking ass hats who built this POS game made it so I, as in ME THE PLAYER, cannot end my fucking turn when I want to. I can't build anything or move anything so I can't do anything. I want my god damn money back!"
29767,Conquer the world! Go to Alpha Centauri! Spread your blue jeans!
29768,Great game!
29769,v fun me like
29770,One of the best games I've ever played.
29771,R
29772,good
29773,Never gets old. Very replayable.
29774,"Games are long and have to be played over multiple sessions usually, but the constant strategy and RNG make this game a must-have for anyone that likes games that keep their mind sharp!"
29775,This game becomes a grinding waste of time after more than an hour of playing.
29776,"Great game, and with mods like Vox Populi it becomes even better.

Be careful though, ""one more turn"" can sometimes take hours to actually happen."
29777,Have been playing this game for a long time and will continue to come back to it.
29778,yeet
29779,k
29780,This game is fun to play and does not get boring since there are multiple ways to win.
29781,"Look, I put 700 hours into this. Obviously it is worth the money."
29782,Timeless
29783,just yes.
29784,"Very fun game! No mod support for multiplayer, but other than that, it is a near-perfect game. It's made for some great fun and great memories."
29785,amazing with decent graphics and is much more fun with basic history and geography skills
29786,Fun
29787,"The best Civ game of all time, hands down."
29788,This game ages like fine wine. Worth every dollar spent. Sometimes I wonder if getting 100% achievement is even humanly possible.
29789,If its on sale buy it. you wont regret it
29790,"Great game, never gets old with friends. Need dlc to enjoy to the max"
29791,The best civ game and easily one of the best turn based 4x's ever made
29792,Its just great!!!
29793,"I like this kind of game, plus I play with people I know. 10/10."
29794,great time killer
29795,Good game
29796,"It is just a pity that features from previous versions have been discontinued.  Otherwise, this version is quite enjoyable."
29797,"good with friends, though id say you need the dlcs to make more interesting(brave nw)"
29798,good game 10/10
29799,"Very fun, easy enough to pick up and play but hard enough to reward you for staying around."
29800,"Still undecided about this one, might need a few more hours on it."
29801,
29802,Fun game and great graphics
29803,turn based classic series
29804,much fun but CIV 6 better
29805,its pretty bruh my dude
29806,Very good game
29807,"If you like history, diplomacy, and have a lot of time on your hands this game is perfect"
29808,My first Civilization game! I cant testify for the newest ones and their expansions but this one is great! It takes awhile to really understand what is going on behind the scenes but once you do it is incredibly satisfying!
29809,great game. civ VI needs improvement
29810,"A brilliant version of one of the greatest games ever made. I am biased as I have played Civ since the original came out when I was in school, but if you enjoy 4X games Civ 5 can be the only one you need to own. It can be the only GAME you need to own!

Build a civilisation from a small tribe in the distant past to a vast network of massive city states in the future. Play on a large number of maps or randomly generated worlds. Discover technologies, develop governments, spread religious ideas and build armies. Many civilisations to choose from, with unique units and abilities.

9/10"
29811,Excellent addition to the Civ collection! Hours of fun and challenge. Anyone that is a fan of Sid should try this game.
29812,love all the civ games
29813,it is fun i have put the most hours out of any game into this
29814,nice until atilla fucks you

29817,good game
29818,Solid Game
29819,good
29820,"Civ 5 is such a great game. It's like your favorite food that you never get tired of. You can go back to it time and time again, and it never gets old. I would definitely recommend this game to anyone that enjoys board games and strategy."
29821,The best TBS game on the market.
29822,The best civilzation ever made and quite possibly the best turn based strategy game ever made.
29823,"you can name cities ""ass fuck"""
29824,Civ V is SO much better than number six!
29825,yes
29826,"Le ke da ti velim? Dobra, zabavna i interesantna igrica :)"
29827,Better than Civ 6.
29828,"I played a bit, it's good"

29838,<3
29839,butt
29840,"I've enjoyed the Sid Meier Civilization series since Civ 3.  I've acquired all the expansion backs and downloadable content and found the game to have difficulty settings that are sufficiently challenging to hold my interest without being excessively challenging to the point I lose interest.

Despite what the number of hours played would indicate, I'm a casual player who might leave the game running for a day or two and then come back to it.  The turn-based approach against the AI opponents really works out well for me."
29841,Best RTS game out there
29842,great game

29844,I like Sid Meier' s Civilization since I first met it (Civ3). This version is also very good to play and I liked the improvements a lot.
29845,"good game, with cool mods"
29846,"Very good 4X game and much better with JFDLC mod enabled with some additional civs.
Strong 9/11."
29847,one of my all time favorite series of games :)

29849,"I honestly just love this game. I've played a few different of the civ games, including 4 and 6, and this one is just always my favorite. I've got almost 100 hours clocked so far and it's just gonna keep getting higher, I promise that."
29850,1799 hours and still awesome!

29853,"America. 
Found Oil.
Domination Victory.

Sums up about my experience in this game so far. 10/10 would raid other cities for Oil."
29854,"This game saved my life.

I am 27.

My ex-wife and I have a daughter together, and adopted our son together. They are now both 4 years old.

When we were going through our separation, I found myself lost and miserable. I was self destructive. I got so mad one day from everything spiraling out of my control that I punched some concrete in a moment of overwhelming emotion. That caused me to break my 5th metacarpal in my right hand... my working hand... my games hand.. the hand that I held and carried my children to bed with.. The hand I desperately needed to make sure I could continue to provide.

After learning of the severity of my self-inflicted damage, I was borderline suicidal. Keep in mind that just a few months before this, I was the happiest man with no history of depression or anxiety. I have never had fits of rage, or been one to break down and cry, but I was in a low spot that just really buried me from being able to see the light on the other side.

Having nothing better to do, I searched for a game I could play, ONE HANDED while I recovered. I somehow stumbled upon this game and read some of the reviews. I decided that it had to be worth a shot... I must admit, I didn't beat the game, or play nearly as long as some of you. In fact, I may have only played this game a day or two.. With that being said, after doing so, I had a new found joy and hope for life. I was able to put behind me the pain and suffering that had been cast over me. I was able to experience other peoples joy and happiness. I was able to see the fruits of my ""labor"". I relaxed for 5 fucking minutes to this music long enough to realize that I was going to be okay.

After coming to that realization, I turned the game off, and I went back to work. It hurt my hand like hell but I was motivated. I stopped feeling so damn sorry for myself, and I became the father I needed to be in that moment, not the weak boy I was behaving as.

Today, I am close friend with my kids mother. We don't fight, or argue, or say hurtful things to each other. We are parents, and friends.

I now have 3 kids. My third child is, wait for it, ALSO 4 YEARS OLD. The woman I am with was going through a very similar situation at the time of my own separation, and we just stumbled in to each others life unexpectedly. We have been in a relationship for a year now, and are very happy together.

Moral of the story, you never know what life holds in store for you, and if I would have given up when all the odds were stacked against me, I wouldn't be where I am today. This silly little game helped me realize that.

Thank you"
29855,"Really addictive world simulator that gives you a plethora of nations and cultures to play as. The amount of freedom you're given is awesome! There are so  many ways to play and so many things to experience, it's a little dated but definitely still a good time!"
29856,Best Turn-based strategy game so far
29857,"Wonderful game for strategy-fans. Round-based, with a love for details and a ideal depth to allow an easy beginner experience as well as long lasting fun.
10 of 10"
29858,civ 6 on sale: civ 5 not on sale: really make you think don't it.
29859,Hard to find a better game
29860,Somehow try to watch a friend playing it and talk you through it. Videos online don't quite give it justice when you aren't certain whats going on!
29861,"Great Game 
game play is smooth well worth a go"
29862,No Quitters Mod makes this game much better multiplayer
29863,pretty good
29864,"I love that there are so many different civilizations with which to attempt wins, different ways to win, and achievements to attain! I've played every version of this game and enjoy each one. Just one more turn....."
29865,"I'd like to ask Aspyr, why is there a few languages missing after transplantation? These files and directories add up effortlessly, so obviously not for technical reasons. What makes you choose to omit these languages on MAC / Linux?

我想问问适配aspyr，为什么移植过后缺了几个语言？这些文件和目录加起来不费吹灰之力，所以显然不是技术原因。是什么让你们选择了在mac/linux上漏掉这几个语言？"
29866,"It's alright, recently completed my first game, had a lot of fun."
29867,"It's civ 5, if u don't like it... ur playing it wrong"

29870,Best game I've ever played
29871,its ok
29872,Amazingly addictive and truly deep. Be prepared to lose yourself in the game of Civilization.
29873,Better than 6 by far
29874,A must have game. Make sure to get the expansion packs.
29875,v good
29876,Is still good.
29877,+10. I learnt the word husbandry from it.
29878,"It's fun, challenging, and a fun way to kill HOURS"
29879,The gold standard for turn based strategy.
29880,Civilization is better than I am.  My review is like a piece of poo reviewing the mona lisa.  It just doesn't compare.  Buy the game.
29881,A great game.
29882,Everything
29883,Best game in the series.
29884,"I like the turn based style, for when i listen to music while playing this game; i feel relaxed and revitalized."
29885,"Incredible replayability, best to buy on sale. Accidentally played for 8 hours today without noticing."
29886,Super addictive and engrossing.
29887,
29888,"it's decent

29889,"Even with it being Firaxis, its at least better than the sequel."
29890,"simply the best strategy game ever made.  I hope Civ 7 comes back to its roots 2k if you're listening, the throwbacks are working..."
29891,"Really fun tbs game, although the expansions are needed to truly have a fantastic experience.  I would also recommend checking out LEKMOD and No Quitters mods after playing for a while.  they really expand the game, its options, and overall entertainment value.  Overall, would rank it 9.5/10.  Definitely a 10/10 playing online with friends."
29892,yes
29893,"This is a good game.  Better than Civ 6 and all the other games.  Probably the best way to spend an evening.  Make sure to grab all the DLC when you get it, as it completes the game."
29894,One of the best strategy games ever.
