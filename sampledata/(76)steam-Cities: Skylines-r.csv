1,"Cities Skylines: Well what can I say that hasn't already been said. Came out as a rival to SimCity (which was a failure) gave people a lot more freedom, large maps, more modding options and took a place in a market which was there for the taking, HOWEVER, this game with its DLC's being sold full of bugs and an extremely heavy RAM requirement at times have began to wear thin on some of us. There is a huge opportunity for them to bring out a sequel that would truly rival anything that has come before. I give this a positive review as I have enjoyed this game, the DLC's released have at times been very buggy and felt botched together and thrown out rather than refined. I also cannot and will not justify the obscene amount they are charging for the DLC's.

It is about time they began developing a Sequel to this, if they learnt lessons from both SimCity and this game it could be amazing.

Overall 7.5/10 for base game but a lowly 3/10 for the DLC's based on price and quality"
2,I've been playing off and on for 5 or 6 years and love it.

6,gud with mods with out mods $hit
7,"This game is what reason i bought my new laptop (A Gaming Laptop), it's a GOAT city simulation game ever. Unleash your creativity build your city and make it BIGGER and more attractive, Mind of People happiness, infrastructures and services, road layouts, transportation and finances, if you don't like the things that limits and puzzled you, turn on the available cheat mods (Unlimited Money and Unlock All) and build city comes in handy without worrying run out of money, Add more Assets in workshop so you can add more buildings and roads on your city and Add Mods to add wholesome advanced, useful features in playing games design/develop your city."
8,"WHY TF THERE IS NO CIM SEEXC >;(((((((( BAD GAME 1000-/10
shitass game booooo :ride on:"
9,"I play the base game, I do not own any DLCs or mod the game. Cities Skylines is a detailed city builder where each player can focus on whatever aspect is most fun for them. Aesthetic aspect? Bam, build yourself a beautiful city. Realism? Sure, build yourself a realistic city. Infrastructure? Yes, you can tweak it for hours and hours of fun (although mods make this better). There are so, so many options, most of which I have yet to explore despite my many hours in this game."
10,"Need far too many of the usually pricey DLCs to make the game worth playing. Truthfully, it needs a successor with an updated engine because it runs poorly on even very high end hardware."
11,This is a great game that I have had a lot of fun with. Its great for people that like strategy games. I also think that there is one aspect that people might not think of but I usually play it against myself/someone else. With this I mean that I often make a new world after Ive learned something new like how to control traffic better or something else that will improve my city. Now Im playing it against my friend and we have great fun in competing who can grow the fastest and keeping the city intact.
12,"its just a very chill game, great for those who like to be creative and try many different things and those who like strategy building games."
13,its good. use mods
14,Not as fun as everyone made it seem. I know I only played for 2 hours but it was not a fun two hours.
15,it is great to build a fantastic-looking city. I recommend who wants to made something during listening music.
16,Its areally nice game and makes much fun. Very realistic. Very recommended for members which play CityBuild games :)
17,"Paradox has broken all the mods again to release another DLC that I dont want. Fuck this attitude. I may or may not update this review if and when I discover I can load my old saves or all the mods get updated. I don't really care anymore since I no longer purchase Paradox material.

Thanks Todd....oh wait, that's another lame developer."
18,The best city sim.
19,Good simulator game
20,I absolutely hate the traffic system in this game. I always have fun building up a city but once you get to a certain amount of people it becomes impossible to scale the roads .
21,I love watching traffic flow so smoothly until it doesn't. And my computer is about to blow up from the amount of mods i have
22,"Outstanding game. Base game is fun, but with the rights mods it takes it to another level again.
The only negative is the game's management of mods could be better."
23,gud
24,Very much recommend to those who like city builders good game on its own but better with Mods ans assets but bad optimization
25,Very nice traffic sim
26,Loading issues
27,"its good for your city building plans

28,
29,i poured sewage all over my town. 10/10
30,"its a good city builder and the modding community is amazing in creating both assets and mods. Over all the base game is ok in terms of what you can do but it really becomes way better when you buy the DLC. The DLC for the game feels like it should come with the game for free or should have been in it in the first place.
Its not worth it to buy them if your not going to play this game long term. (100+ hours)

 The game Seriously needs to be optimised severely. Ive played this game with a i3 6100 and a ryzen 3700x and the performance is night and day when theres no population, but when the population grows past 25 thousand it slows down drastically. 

The mods for this game is one of the best modding and custom asset creators i have seen. I can usually find what i need whether its a road fence way to mod or move objects in game, its amazing what these modders have done and because of them this game would not have lasted this long. 

The last thing is the traffic system. The AI is the smartest large scale AI that i know of but its also the dumbest and super unrealistic. but overall its satisfying when it is working properly. the Cims will leave there houses to go to work/school/shopping etc and return to that exact same house and grow older and die. they will also walk/bike the equivalent of los angeles to go to a park and then drive back home with a car that they just spawned and hold up traffic just because. 

Final thoughts Base game overall ok, DLC+base game make it feel complete, With mods you can make cities that look like a real city if you want to put in the time. This game is a Artist and Engineers paradise and i recommend it."
31,Its way fun
32,fun city builder
33,"the only enjoyable way to play this game is with mods, but when they release a new DLC it breaks the mods and your saved game is rendered useless and hours of time spent building your city is gone."
34,I love building dystopian shit hole cities so riddled with crime and sewage. Can't have nothin' in Detroit man. Nothin' at all.
35,"Stops loading past 99%, when I press Alt+F4 its starts. I need help with this"
36,Fun Challenging and seriously creative game with unlimited possibilities.
37,Great Game
38,building city make pain go away
39,Addictive
40,"most of the DLCs should be free update content, but the devs refuse to stop milking this game"
41,"without necessary DLC packs, the game is bland AF. Engine is unstable, at high population cities, game has a high chance of crashing - Possibly bricking whole save."
42,It is an awesome in-depth game. Very realistic. It is a serious upgrade to Sims City.
43,very addicting game very realistic highly recommended
44,Very Fun

47,Used to play SimCity (all of them) and this game blows them all out of the water. The modding community for this game is absolutely amazing. Best city building game there is.

51,"As a simcity gamer since 2000, It's a solid game. If you're looking for a city builder with granular configurations and modifications, this game has it. What it lacks in aesthetics, it makes up for in impressive mod support and simulation power. Has pretty much everything simcity 4 had. So it's a step up. 

Note that the DLCs significantly transform the game, and the game will feel repetitive pretty quickly without certain must-have DLCs. So expect to spend more on the game than just the base-game."
52,fucking game broke so my 200k+ city that i spent hours on is gone forever please dont buy this game save urself the wasted time go do somethiong productive instead
53,"Love it
"
54,"Excellent game! The community is amazing and lots of mods are available. New DLCs are regularly announced, but they are quite expensive for little new content. Hope that the game will stay alive, eventually with a version 2 in continuity with version 1."
55,"Paradox keeps milking this old, buggy, unstable mess of a game with more half assed DLCs and content packs instead of releasing a new game with a better, more optimized engine. The only thing keeping this game alive is the modding community. Without mods, it would be utterly worthless."
56,It's the one time I get to run the dystopian hellscape instead of just live in it!
57,"Pros:
Fun, endless hours of play until...
...mods, assets, & maps better than the base game, and until...

Cons:
...it does not support Intel Integrated Graphics Cards.
...way too many DLCs, most aren't worth it.

Total Rating: 8/10"
58,Amazing game!
59,Great game with poor optimalization.
60,"awesome  builder, lot of options"
61,Excellent game!
62,Really fun game with so many options to make things interesting.
63,"Great game, plenty of strategy, always a fun time, love all the extensions and community support!"
64,sangat mendidik
65,Remarkably boring base game. Hardly anything to do or build.
66,"Just got back to this game 3 days ago, cleared the Workshop, downloaded only the ""essential"" mods and their dependencies and some assets and started a fresh new city. It was all cool until the update dropped today and the game doesn't even load. No way to revert to the old version and now I have to wait for all the mods to update. And it may take weeks. I don't blame the modders, having to fix your mods every game update must be a pain in the arse. And I don't really feel like playing the vanilla game, as it looks about as realistic as Bollywood physics. For realism and stability better try Workers and Resources. Will probably come back to this game in a year or so just to start a new city, experience an ""update"" and quit again. 10/10 peak entertainment."
67,Great game but getting a bit tired of DLC's Lets release a new version eh?
68,"6 lane one way road sounds good until you get a traffic jam on only the right lane, the others are empty and don`t exist.
And this sums up the quality of the whole cities skylines experience, the larger your city becomes the worse everything gets. Traffic jams everywhere, public transit barely works, etc.

Now you could spent 150-200€ for a ton of dlc to make it all suck less, but yeah, not gonna do that."
69,"I love Sim games and this city builder is in my opinion,the best there is."
70,"The best city game ever! If you include mods it will get way enjoyble!
10000/10"
71,"it's a great game, but you should get mods."
72,Love this game
73,"Very good game, the modding community is great"
74,"Really fun city building game.  It lacks a lot of assets you'd think should be in the base game (more roads, intersections, highways, paths, sidewalks, landscapes, basic city buildings options, etc.), so you end up installing a bunch of mods.  The mods are great when they work but often times have issues and you spend your game time fixing problems.  Plenty of DLCs available but this game really needs a sequel with all of those basic assets built-in so no mods are required.  I'd buy that game."
75,"TL/DR: Great game, best around in genre, wait for sales.

I hear many complaints about how this title has progressed over the years. And as a person with an opinion, ultra rare type I know, I wanted to drop off my 2 cents here. 

1: Yes, if you are a newcomer to this title and are staring down the mountain of DLC's and it's now over $200.00 price tag, it feels pretty overwhelming. Please try and keep in mind that this price tag has been accruing for almost, what, 7 years now? So yeah, a little perspective there is helpful I feel.

2: The radio stations/ content creator packs. They are really nice, I like them. If price is bothering you, however, then I fully say workshop stations and stuff can help there. Sure, there are those who want to just keep it vanilla, and that's cool, just my thoughts in general. Yeah, these particular DLCs are a little overpriced for what they actually are. So if modding isn't your bag, wait for sales. Don't buy those full out if you can help it. (Ok that's kind of decent advice for the whole line actually, wait for a good sale, they happen a LOT with this. I saw it down to like 70 bucks for the entire bundle not too long ago.)

3: Cities Skylines is a Monopoly here. They are the only real game in town. They know that. We know that. As much as I would like a competitor to show up and actually give them a proper go for the crown here, until that happens, can any of us honestly say if we were in a position to be a monopoly with a really really good IP that we would do any different? I highly doubt any of us would be able to sniff those millions and walk away.

Keep in mind also, that as bad as we want Paradox to cater to our every little whim and desire here, they are a company. After reading many of the comments and reviews complaining about price, I added it all up. If Paradox caved in and gave all of the complaints what was being demanded/berated here, sure we would have the entire lot, every DLC and every extra pack ever, down to about 10 bucks out the door. And while that sounds so wonderful to those of us who are paying our real money for this, that would also mean there would be no Paradox/Colossal, they would be laying off all of their employees, shutting their doors, and none of us would have this to complain about at all. So ya know, give and take?

Overall this is a 9/10 to me, the point loss is, hypocritically on my part, about the prices for the radio station packs. Modding just makes this game even better. Amazing possibilities still in this, again, 6+ year old title. Most games that age are relegated to the ""Top 10 remember when"" videos."
76,"There is so much expensive DLC that should've been base game content. I'll be honest, there's not a whole lot you can do with base game + disaster DLC. Mods definitely help, and I've had fun, but cities get hard to maintain late-game because of garbage trucks and hearses taking nonsensical routes across highways that take 10x as long."
77,Can you please stop releasing new DLCs for 5 minutes and fix the traffic instead?
78,"literally tickles my adhd in all the right places.

and i will play it for 6 hours straight when i start it"
79,"Good game with mods, without you have a lot of low quality buildings. New updates are awesome, except for the part that all the mods break

[I'm using 84 mods lol]"
80,"Paradox's dlc prices are getting worse, the game's good though, only played base game however."
81,This game will absorb your time. Highly Recommend
82,f
83,"O melhor city building que existe, tem mais uma caralhada de mods que deixam o jogo melhor ainda, o problema é que a Paradox sabe que tem o único city building que presta e abusa lançando um monte de dlc para coisas que deveriam estar no jogo base."
84,"Well fleshed out game with developers extremely tolerant (dare I say supportive) of mods, which makes it difficult to get bored of this game. I can put cities skylines down for months on end, but always come back to it at some point.

When I return to it I always find that there is no steep relearning curve, as there is with many other, more fast-paced games, so I can always dig right back in where I was before. An excellent time killer for that one day when you are stuck at home waiting for a delivery you can't miss, or when you simply want to be an unsociable hermit for a while. 

I definitely recommend this game."
85,city
86,Good game
87,Great game to pass a lot of time on .It is very relaxing and entertaining expanding your creativity.
88,">>>TLDR in the end.<<<

 First of all, Cities Skylines is a good City Builder and City Manager no doubt about it! It is very in depth and offers a nice experience. And given the modabiliy and community support has wonderful amount of options and customizability. 

This game is really in depth, you can create awesome cities and mod support is awesome. You can micro-manage industry,
public transit, and lots more. The cities need some thought put into the road layout as to avoid to much traffic. 
It has ""milestones"" that walk you a little through the beginnings and explain the core gameplay-loop in a comprehensive way. 


HOWEVER!

First Point: DLC Policy
 The DLC policy is horrific. It should be a crime for Studios to pull something like this. Looking at the past such as SimCity. Cities Skylines is an insult. Features such as parks, natural disasters, radio stations, architectures, propper day/night cycles, tourism, an 10.000 things more are all extra DLC to be bought for roughly 175 Bucks. 

While SimCity 5 did do a lot of things...oddly, it still offered lots of features on its own, and when a DLC was made, it added some significant addition. Here, gameplay features that should be added by default are gated behing often times badly priced DLC. Even other City Simulations that each have their own niche, are in my opinion superior. Simply due to not being a total scam when it comes to game content. At this point asking for a game to have features out of the box is heresy. 

Worst of all: Many mods on the Workshop add much better overhauls to the base game than ANY dlc could. Of course many are also DLC dependent. Mods add 90% of the enjoyment to the game as they remove many strange limits and rebalance the game properly. Plus mods add features that are actually desired by the community...Such as decor, finer control over roads, bug fixes, balancing, better LODS, performance improvement etc. 

Second Point: Balancing

You could have city stretching for 100's of KM but only have like 50k people living in it. The calculations for the amount of ""Cims"" the city is populated by is just a crude guess. By this game's standard, New York City would be a ""Town"" of 50k Citizens. The Cims also have a very unrealistic lifespan simulation, that makes them quite short lived causing a high turnover-rate in citizens, which becomes incresingly annoying as entire city blocks because derelict because of it. 
Literally DAYS go by as a car waits at the Intersection because a day lasts 10 Seconds, all the while the actual day/night cycle is far more reasonable. Again, youd need a Mod to fix this mess, that fixes cities living for 5 minutes, a day lasting 10 seconds and a car needing a Week to drive from one intersection to the other. The simulation speed is absolutely out of whack. 

Again, community content needs to adress issues that should NOT exist right out of the box. you should not need to install 20 different mods to fix the horrible balancing and add content that should be included default for the price. 
Realistically, this game cost you 200 €/$/ etc because ontop of the 20 Buck price tag you need 200 DLC to get the content other games offer for...well 20 Bucks.  

The worst part is: If you want mods to fix these issues, youre gonna be waiting 10-20 minutes REAL TIME for the thing to load. Thats with a good amount of RAM an SSD, and a good CPU


Point Three: Its more fun to watch than to play. 
I find myself enjoying lets plays more so than acually playing, seeing also how many players depend on mods to make their cities functions and to have semblance of content is quite sad. But again, demanding a full experience without needing 175 Bucks just to get features other games offered/offer as base content is heresy to many. Alas, I dont support large studios getting away with the bare minimum. 

TLDR:

I cannot recomend this game simply due the DLC policy, and the depency on mods. Mods are need to fix the most basic issues, the loading times are insanely long, the base game has no amount of content that be enjoyed outside of being a (pretty inacurate) simulation. Sadly, it seems like a DLC dependent, slow loading, inaccurate and performance demanding ""game"" is what we have to praise. It gets away with doing the bare minimum and demands insane sums to give you content that a AAA title should be have default."

91,HEY KID WANNA TRY DRUG? DOWNLOAD THIS GAME THEN

93,no strip clubs im very sad that i bought the game
94,Good.
95,Best City Builder game on the market for quite some time. The game is really good and the simulation is quite fun. Modding enhances the gameplay experience exponentially by giving you harder/realistic simulation or giving you tonnes of assets to play with. 10/10
96,Quite simply the finest city builder there is.
97,Y E S
98,"I love the game, I've poured long hours just inventing all sorts of cities. I mean, 500 hours plus! However, ever since Paradox decided to upgrade the Launcher, it's been a MAJOR pain to even start it.

I migrated from Windows 10 to Linux because I tried everything to fix the sudden freeze to no avail. After researching online and seeing the scores of people having to troubleshoot the Paradox Launcher alone, why bother? Why even have that in the way? Propriety maybe? Fine, but makes no sense to start a game to start a game. No other games in my library are affected, they work fine on both OS's.

Makes me sad to not play this game anymore because I'm just bummed out tired of having to waste time fixing things that shouldn't need fixing. I'm convinced it's an integrated error at this point on Paradox's behalf, who knows if on purpose."

The in-game achievements are grindy, but not hard with the exception of few... Nonetheless, they are there for experienced players.
Ordinary gameplay might take time to learn and adapt. Here are mistakes that some rookies can make;
- Build too many clinics
- Screw up terrain/Canal building
- Waste funds easily by over spending on a service thats not important (like parks and rec. etc.)

111,cant wait for CS2
112,"This game saved my life.

I am 27.

My ex-wife and I have a daughter together, and adopted our son together. They are now both 4 years old.

When we were going through our separation, I found myself lost and miserable. I was self destructive. I got so mad one day from everything spiraling out of my control that I punched some concrete in a moment of overwhelming emotion. That caused me to break my 5th metacarpal in my right hand... my working hand... my games hand.. the hand that I held and carried my children to bed with.. The hand I desperately needed to make sure I could continue to provide.

After learning of the severity of my self-inflicted damage, I was borderline suicidal. Keep in mind that just a few months before this, I was the happiest man with no history of depression or anxiety. I have never had fits of rage, or been one to break down and cry, but I was in a low spot that just really buried me from being able to see the light on the other side.

Having nothing better to do, I searched for a game I could play, ONE HANDED while I recovered. I somehow stumbled upon this game and read some of the reviews. I decided that it had to be worth a shot... I must admit, I didn't beat the game, or play nearly as long as some of you. In fact, I may have only played this game a day or two.. With that being said, after doing so, I had a new found joy and hope for life. I was able to put behind me the pain and suffering that had been cast over me. I was able to experience other peoples joy and happiness. I was able to see the fruits of my ""labor"". I relaxed for 5 ♥♥♥♥ing minutes to this music long enough to realize that I was going to be okay.

After coming to that realization, I turned the game off, and I went back to work. It hurt my hand like hell but I was motivated. I stopped feeling so damn sorry for myself, and I became the father I needed to be in that moment, not the weak boy I was behaving as.

Today, I am close friend with my kids mother. We don't fight, or argue, or say hurtful things to each other. We are parents, and friends.

I now have 3 kids. My third child is, wait for it, ALSO 4 YEARS OLD. The woman I am with was going through a very similar situation at the time of my own separation, and we just stumbled in to each others life unexpectedly. We have been in a relationship for a year now, and are very happy together.

Moral of the story, you never know what life holds in store for you, and if I would have given up when all the odds were stacked against me, I wouldn't be where I am today. This silly little game helped me realize that.

Thank you
"
113,veri good
114,would be better if they didn't want you to spend over $200 on dlc packs for longevity of the game
115,"Cities: Skylines is hands down the best in city builders. It takes the best ideas from games like Sim City, improves on them, and adds its own take on city management.

The base vanilla set is already a fantastic game, but each DLC adds something extra to your cities without being essential. Some DLC gives you the option to really dig into building detailed parks, universities, and industrial sectors, and while doing so will be very rewarding, you can safely stick to ""generic"" set ups in the core game.

The game and DLCs go on sale all the time, so giving it a chance is relatively inexpensive.

If you loved Sim City games, you'll love Cities: Skylines. Highly recommended."
116,Pretty good.
117,....
118,"You start a new city, its going really well. You come off for the night. Your mind is filled with good thoughts and hope for your city. You wake up excited to grow. You log on to your city covered in shit and garbage. You are out of money because you spent it all on the big motorways that arent even needed yet. You have no cemeterys. Bodies pile up in houses. All the fish are dead because of your pollution. You give up and start again. This then repeats with every city. I would still recommend though"
119,hm
120,good for being bad and bad for being good.
121,Great game
122,"The Vanilla game is already a massive step up from Sim City, there is so many options the devs give you to build your dream city, then add some mods and assets into the mix and the game becomes unreal, I can build something I could have only dreamed of back in the days of SimCity 4, from comprehensive Public Transport networks with real life vehicles to life like neighbourhoods to using tools like Traffic manager PEm Node controller and Intersection marking tool I can create functional junctions that not only look realistic but are more functional than real life junctions. would 100% reccomend this game and Paradox wheres Cities Skylines 2?"
123,Great game!
124,"You are creating a world from your perspective on how a city should look, feel, sound, live.  Having all the tools from the game, and work shop makes this the greatest city building game ever."

139,"[h1] Rating: 5/5 [/h1]

Cities Skylines makes a strong case for why non-fictional colony simulators tend to come down to implementation. The UI/UX of building cities from the ground up in this game is an extremely satisfying process. In addition, playing this game definitely inspired me to spend some time learning about real world road hierarchy & city-block implementations across the world. Another strong positive about this game is the support for workshop content, which continues to expand interesting options for making cities. If you want to build cities this is the game to start with."
140,pog game
141,This game is something to do if you are bored and can give you something to do.
142,Best city building game ever wish it was more optimized. Have an high end pc still getting low performance.
143,Excellence
144,NICE
145,"Honestly, I love this game but I'm so tired of Paradox's DLC approach and the lack of updates on a Cities Skylines 2 where we don't have to worry about mods working within the limitations  of an aging game."
146,"For anyone who loved the older sim cities you will find yourself at home. There is something to love for most city builders out there and you will find yourself plugging away many hours to manage traffic, learning to hate cars, embracing the roundabout, out growing the roundabout, having to resort back to well designed car only intersections, learning to adapt and make certain junctions depending on the need of your city and traffic. Bruh this game will make you think, to design beautiful cities.

My personal con for the game. You have to have goals for your city. There is a natural evolution to balancing the 3 zone types needs but to keep the game interesting you have to step out of your comfort zone to develop unique and purposeful city additions to challenge you, take advantage of the tools the game and modders give you"
147,"i dunno
its good ¯\_(ツ)_/¯"
148,"Kind of bare bones if you do not have DLC, but still fun. If you add DLC and mods there is literally endless detail you can put into your cities."
149,Its a really great city builder if you liked sim city you'll really enjoy this game and the modding community within
150,It is a fun chill game. Sit down build a city and watch it grow.
151,"Well, years ago i loved this Game, spend 200hrs in it and still not enough.

Then i came back, 7 years past by, a tons of DLC came out and now?
Not a single Mod work anymore, even the simpliest of removing this f*cking annoying Chirper.
All i see is the Developer get greedy to Money and so u can buy EVERYTHING that Modders gave for free.
To enjoy all the Game could give u as ""Quality of life"" accessoires u have to drop ~230$ or 220€....
Devs? U wanna f*cking kidding me? ist that seriously ur goal about an 8 years old Game?
To squeeze out Money for Content that Weekend-Modders gave us for free?
even if i donate every Mod i use 5€ i wouldnt pass the 100 (include the Sell-price).

Devs - u defintly f*cked up the best Game since Sim City. i will never touch your monetary Issue of your way u decide."
152,the game still agter all this time has so many huge flaws its insane i just sat for 3 hours trying to figure out why none of my 7 garbage incinerators didnt send any trucks to collect garbage i even built roads that were direct connection to the area that needed disposing and yet none of my 7 facilities sent a single truck anywhere the game is extremly buggy and at some points almost unplayable because of them
153,very good
154,very much good for boring days
155,The best game I've played in my life and I've played it for years and I can't get enough of it
156,One of my favorite games!
157,Amazing game. Just as all other Paradox products.

165,"I have been playing Cities: Skylines since it's release back in 2016, where has the time gone. This game is what Simcity could never be. The graphics, game play, etc. is so well done; I'm still mind blown to this day. Even without any of the DLCs, this game has so much to offer. However, if you want things like the day night cycle, tourism, etc., you will need to buy at least one or two of the DLCs. Despite this, even without the expansion packs, Cities: Skylines is a unreal city building experience. Almost all of the bugs have been fixed, however there are still some issues here and there. Overall, Cities: Skylines is one of the best city building games out there, and I do not believe that any game will overtake it anytime soon."

169,"playable game, try it"
170,This is THE city building game!
171,"This game is incredibly addicting and fun I thought that I wouldn't have patience for it but the game explains it well enough without being too extensive about it one thing I thought it should improve would be traffic handling the more I played the more I understood that it was due to zoning and restrictions imposed on roads such as creating more one way lanes. Since I wanted to start one map and do most of what I could do I only used one map the first one I started with and installed TPE mod and restructuring some of the roads. 
Pretty great city manager while still being fun and addicting.
FYI I got a good deal 30€ with humble bundle for this game with all dlcs, except for the latest one and more to come."
172,jhghjg
173,"You know I have played this game more hours than I can legitimately admit to anyone!!! It is addicting no doubt. The base version is ok, but yes the DLCs and the mods make it a whole different world. Of course it is easy to get lost in the mods as well, but that is okay, what is a city for if not to be demolished by a swarm of asteroids, earthquakes, tornadoes and lighting storms right?!"
174,"fucking great, destroy the home of anyone who complains about me on twitter!"
175,"Played for 1000's of hours when I had it on Origin, wouldnt let me port across to steam or use mods.

To get the best out of the game buy as many DLC's as you can Industry is the most important one. 

"
176,I always come back to this game.
177,It is not perfect but it is an extremely good city builder. I would recommend this game to anyone.
178,Best City Building Game Ever!? I guess...
179,good game
180,Addictive
181,"As an Urban Planning major, Cities: Skylines is one of my favourite games of all time. I love being able to customize cities how I would want to see them built in real life."
182,LOVE IT
183,spent way to much time playing this game only to delete every city ive done lol
184,super
185,Fun game
186,I've always played Cities Skylines on the Xbox and it was always the same thing over and over. But with Steam. it feels like a whole new game with the workshop. Between TM:PE and SkyBox Mods it doesn't feel like the same game. Would 100% recommend.
187,"An absolutely amazing game.

10 out of 10"
188,fun
189,grape game
190,"this is a scam.
I bought the game, didnt like the first 10 min playing it. 
I wanted a refund. 
I cant play the game anymore and i didnt get any money back.
 WHAT IS THIS STEAM???"
191,niceeeeeeee
192,w
193,.
194,"Good game, definitely  recommend,  although you need some DLC's to enjoy the game. The workshop also has good mods for this game, as I feel that the space for building is too small without the 81 tiles mod. Definitely buy if you enjoy building cities, making transport and road networks etc. 8/10"
195,"great game, could use more variation with roads and more control over traffic in general"
196,"I've loved this game for years. The base game has so much to it, but the modding community so very active and so creative."
197,fun
198,buil ding
199,"I don't know if this is the best city sim out there, but man I sink hours into this game. There are times I sit there working on stuff almost all day to times I have it running in the background so I got something to multi-task through the day. I love a lot about Skylines and hate some, but overall I keep coming back for more. This is also one of the very few games I bought DLC for because the devs deserve that contribution. Most of the updates are already given to you with some placed behind the DLC that will actually change how the game works/how you play. So TL:DR for my rambling, Skylines is probably one of the best city sims based on its actual design, dev team, and modding community that keep this game thriving without so much as a break to catch a breath."
200,cities skylines
201,"Overpriced DLCs aside, really good game."
202,OH DEAR GOD NO PLEASE GOD NO
203,Have this on both pc and ps4. Great city builder!
204,Great game for geography nerds like me

206,WHY ON EARTH A CITY SIMULATION GAME SHOULD LIMIT THE NUMBER OF TREES??? WHO LIMITS THE COUNT OF TREES IN BIG CITIES??? NOT ONLY UNREALISTIC BUT ALSO PURELY NONSENSE TO DO SO!
207,10/10 oyun zaman öldürmek için mükemmel
208,great game
209,"best game
"
210,"After playing this game for years, the answer is more or less a yes, but not the base version. Buying along at least After Dark, Mass Transit, Green Cities, Industries, and ParkLife DLCs are a must.
Quite a few of caveats, some mods are also essential (at least to me) to play with. Such as, 81 or 25 Tiles Mod, Traffic Manager, Node Controller, Move It, Loading Screen Mod, Fine Road Anarchy + Tool, and Extra Landscaping Tools.

I personally wouldn't really recommend this game without them."
211,yes this good
212,When SimCity 5 was announced I was very interested and purchased the prerelease. After getting it was very disappointed. I was looking for a better SimCity 4 and they ruined everything. Then I found Skylines. This is what SimCity 5 should have been about! I'm looking forward to the next version but I don't want to repurchase all the DLC's. Everything that has been added to Skylines via DLC should be included in the next version.
213,me play me buld me happy :)
214,"One of my favorite games of all time.. it's simple, but complicated; it's relaxing but you can't look away. But seriously on that last one-- if you have an addictive personality and this game seems up your ally, I'm warning you now how dangerous this game can be. There's literally always more to do. Also, TONS of mods to add so you can do and have close to anything you want. It's just a great game.."
215,Absolutely wonderful game!
216,"Remember playing Sim City on the SNES? Remember saying, ""Gosh, it'd be great if everything were more customizable?"" ....yeah. You'll regret that wish coming true when you have work the next morning, it's 4AM and your trying to mitigate a traffic jam.

Great for people who obsess over details!"
217,poopoo river
218,One of the best city simulator I ever play!!!
219,Relaxing game
220,e
221,"it's annoying that you have to buy so much extensions for the game to be interresting.... 
the cities are so american it's freaking annoying.... you can't build something nice and the AI of cars is junk, crossing each others' path on the highways.....
i try to put so many public transport so they don't have to drive, what do they do ? pop in a car in the middle of nowhere blocking every other car while they figure out where to go..... so annoying...."
222,its very cool relaxing and great if you like cityies
223,"Actual crack. The vanilla base game is already insanely addicting, then you throw in the DLC and the insane mod support and my reptile brain cannot put it down."
224,"After cancelling the SKYLINE GT-R in 1973, NISSAN revived the GT-R again in 1989. At the time NISSAN was competing in Group A Racing with the SKYLINE GTS-R. NISSAN wanted to retire the GTS-R in favor of a more competitive vehicle. The new generation GT-R, E-BNR32 chassis (commonly shortened to R32), was designed to dominate Group A racing. NISSAN Kohki (NISSAN's power train engineering and manufacturing facility) originally tested a twin turbocharged 2350cc bored and stroked version of the RB25 engine. This set up produced 233 kW (313 hp) and used a RWD drivetrain. Under Group A regulations, a turbocharged engine must multiply its engine displacement by 1.7, putting the new SKYLINE in the 4000 cc class, and requiring the use of 10-inch-wide tires."
225,Every feature is a DLC... Buy if you are rich.
226,The best city sandbox game ever
227,I will not recommend any game with a 3rd party launcher. FUCK 3rd party launchers.
228,Relaxing game.
229,Do you like cities?  or do you LOVE Cities.  Cities Skylines is like NYC had a baby with the Tajmahal and digitized itself.  So there you go - go on now - just download it.
230,"Very fun...
"
231,"This game is super fun  never gets boring hope it stays like that :)
"
232,"I dunno about this one. I find it more annoying and frustrating than enjoyable and fun. It's not casual enough to just play every now and then and it's not hardcore enough to be a good sim (not without a ton of mods, most of which should really be core). Whenever I think of picking it up again, I am reminded I'd have to buy a pile of DLCs to get the full experience and I just don't want to do that."
233,Great game! Unlimited ideas :D
234,Jai hind pakistan pakistan
235,nice game but you need mods otherwise its boring
236,"9999% better than the recent junk SimCity made by EA.
/ Big map
/ Large asset
/ modding
/ rob your people
/ radio sound

X high use of ram
X paradox horde of DLC (at least there is update)
X stupid twitter in game

In sum just buy it if u like simulator type of game. No city building better than this right now"
237,"My oldest son got this as a gift for me to try out and let me tell you I have lost HOURS playing this game! I will start to play this at about 1 pm and look up and it is suddenly 7 am...lol Wasn't sure how it was going to go but it is awesome.  BTW, I am an ""older"" gamer so for someone my age to get involved in a game like this is kinda saying something.  It can be frustrating at first, but once you get the hang of it and stop bankrupting yourself by building too many roads it's quite fun!  The elevation for the roads and some of the game mechanics can be a little off putting (again at first) but you can get the hang of it quite easy.  Would definitely recommend and have done so!"
238,"I love the idea of this game, i.e. having a somewhat limited base game that can be easily extended with mods and custom assets.
However, the execution of this idea is terrible.

Mod support ingame is flawed too:
This is a Unity game, so all the assets are loaded in memory on game load, hence you require TONS of memory if you want to play this game with a lot of assets
Mod disabling is useless since disabled mods still run code and break things
You can't do a ""Second load"" (exit to main menu and load another city) with mods. It WILL break the game. Why is it allowed, then?
The Content Manager is laggy. That makes it hard to use and unreliable when you have lots of mods. Same for the mod settings panel.
The game lacks expandability and customizability. If it didn't, you wouldn't see all those ""Fix <some vanilla feature>"" mods all over the place, such as mods for blocking useless Steam requests (Less Steam), fixing broken render distances (Render It), setting up mod load order (Load Order Mod), optimizing the loading process (LSM), boosting FPS (FPS booster)
Overall, this game feels frustrating and limitating when playing with a lot of mods and assets. It lacks freedom and optimization.


Some simple things the developpers could do to improve mod support so i'm not just complaining:
[list]
[*] Remove mod disabling
[*] Change the mod initalization process or prevent players from doing a ""Second load""
[*] Implement functionality similar to FPS Booster or Loading Screen Mod. Those mods improve performance with no side effects.
[*] Add more graphics options for managing LODs and render distances, as well as texture sharpness (mipmap level)
[/list]
This could make the live of players with high subscription count a lot easier
But I can take a guess at what the root of the problem is. It's an architectural problem with the game's code. The game was rushed to release and code expandability and reusability wasn't the main priority"
239,I made a city of 30 thousand people and it felt like I was the mayor of New York.
240,awesome
241,E
242,cool
243,"Honestly if there were not so many unnecessary DLCs this game would be great, but unless you have large pockets don't expect to do much with this game. 4/10 in my opinion."
244,"Its actually pretty good! It may be hard at the beginning but just search up on youtube! Easy! Like the sewage problem was the worse so i searched it up, boom! There is no end in the game. You just build cities. thats it"
245,"My girlfriend played this for 2 hours and has never played since.

She's rinsed £22.99 off me, but I suppose at a cost of £11.545 per hour, it is worth buying."
246,tip: put sewage near water collector. Free liquid chocolate for everyone
247,I like this product
248,"Amazing gameplay, zero lag at all, perfect game. Even good with no DLC's"
249,I like trains.... BUT THEYRE ALWAYS STUCK AT THE EDGE OF THE GOD DAMN MAP!!!! FIX YOUR SHIZ.

always a fun game to play for a week to make amazing city"
251,10/10. Mods make it 20/10. Best game ever <3.

255,"Waste of time!

The vehicles' AI sucks, at least the default one. They will chose the already congested path even though a similar path is provided. Lane switching is madness.

258,"It’s really fun, but it always turns into a traffic management simulator, so consider yourself warned. But fixing the traffic can itself be fun"
259,best game ever

261,"managed to accidentally flood an entire city.
also the amount of DLC is a bit ridiculous but that's Paradox as always ig"

POO BOX!

POO BOX!"
266,Great game to enjoy for all - or simply accidentally breaking your functioning city...
267,Very enjoyable.
268,Very good to play while relaxing
269,"This game is so addictive! I first bought it on Xbox, then bought a PC and installed it, then bought an epic gaming rig to play even BIGGER MODDED MAPS! Got over 5000 hours in this game and I love what the devs keep doing. Best city builder I've ever played hands down.."
270,one big gridlock simulator
271,much enjoy

274,honestly one of my favourite games to waste time in. It sucks me in for hours at a time and I love it.

276,I somtimes crashes but its good
277,BUILD GAME
278,"Wost time sink since Civilisation II for me - and that's high prize. You can get so lost in managing your sprawling city, playing whack-a-mole with the problems that pop up, its so much fun and really is easy to lose hours playing it, even if you just popped on for a few minutes."
279,I love the data + complexity of this game. You absolutely need the Down Loadable Content (DLC) to customize this game. But it's worth spending another $50 to get started as a newbie. Play on!
280,
281,Just surpassed 100 hours and it feels like I put in 10. Time moves quicker when playing this game.
282,Lovey with the Mods
283,its truely a fun game with mods 10/10
284,"I love this game, since it's release it has been an immersive BEAST of a game. But it feels like recently they have become Rockstar and are trying to squeeze every dollar out of the game. The more recent DLC's are okay, but seem like they should've always been in the game (especially the most recent, Plazas DLC). Just make the second game and be done with it. 

Also if you are new and want to play this, just know this game performs like a prostitute paying taxes. You'll need a NASA supercomputer to get more than 20 FPS when your city grows fairly large, and if you run mods/community content many of the mods will cause issues between each other (Harmony is great but not perfect). 

However I'd like to leave on a good note, so what I will say is it's INCREDIBLY easy to spend 8 hours at a time in this game. Hopefully Cities 2 is in the works

290,amazing i like building cities even on obama face
291,"Like it, complicated, ui sucks, mods are useful but the ui for them also is not compatible with my brain sometimes. Fun, lets you explore ideas in a pretty accurate simulation, like to city plan :P."
292,needs even more dlc that add like 2 things
293,"nice
"
294,"tutorial isn't really help, but once you understand basic stuffs, game is quite fun.

[h2]1) How to Elevate Roads in Cities: Skylines[/h2]
Two keys: Page Up, and Page Down! That’s it. While you’re laying down infrastructure, and you find yourself in need of an elevation change, just tap one of those two buttons to modify the height your road is at.

It goes without saying, but Page Up raises elevation and Page Down lowers it. If a single tap doesn’t change the elevation enough, you can hit the button as many times as you need (within tolerances) to change the elevation."

299,vv good

302,Waste of money.
303,"Being an old HoFamer for Simcity, Artaxis approves! 10/10"
304,"Do you want to build a city? Then pick it up
Go find out what the ""essential mods"" are and the game is even better. 
Is it perfect? No. 
Does it need more optimization than can likely be achieved in this older title? Probably. 
Will there be a sequel? Hopefully. 
Is it the best city-builder since Sim City 4? Absolutely--and conveniently for the devs, it is really the only pure city-building option out there right now. Hence the continued support and DLC production."
305,"It was difficult for me to make a little city that functioned.  I tried 3 times over the last couple years, and every time I run into some problems that are overwhelming.   I played all the old sim city games, and I bought Skylines because of how much I enjoyed all the earlier games, but this one idek."
306,"game is great and all, however u need mods in order to have a better experience. the community for this game is awesome and you can find virtually anything extra in the workshop, but I also forgot to mention that dlc's are a problem, you will probably give in and buy some at some point, some of the dlc's should be base game content by default."

329,Speedrunning getting a city done before the next update breaks all the mods is an extreme sport
330,"The game is good and enjoyable if you're into City-Building and Simulation game, Prolly even one of the best in that category right now. Good job for the developer(Colossal Order) who created this beautiful game that I really love to play, but as much as I love this game, I really hate how the publisher tried so hard to squeeze every single penny from this game, Like wow 200USD for a ""full"" game? Seriously? It's not even AAA+++++ games with RTX PRO MAX ON, 2000++ IQ AI, or a Very beautiful/natural/super-immersive game that will blow your head and turn your PC into a Concorde flying in supersonic speed.

Don't get me wrong, Like I said, I love this game but the monetization by the publisher is just killing it. And yeah Mod do exist in this game and you can slap it till it exploded but you're still gonna miss few or tons of part that you cannot use till' you paid more. Lack of competition is prolly the reason why they're able or have a reason to charge you more, I hope there'll be other game like this that has better ""Value for money"" for us Low-Budget-gamer :c

-Here's a simpler explanation about this game- [spoiler]by McD cuz am hungry rn[/spoiler]
It's like a Burger with Bun and patty, but it feels bland isn't? very normal stuff without other things like veggies, fries yadda-yadda, you can add Broccoli or a even chocolate(?) with mods if you're into it but few mods requires you to have a certain DLC like.. Fries DLC to get a Truffle flavored one or a Vanilla Ice cream flavored one... yeah. anyway overall game is 5.8/10


Yes this is in someway a rant but whatever, thank you for wasting your time reading my beautifully created and critical review.

Have a great day."

332,"Roundabout? Like a circle, like you encircle the grass in the middle, encirclement as in the act of war, war as in WWII, WWII as in HOI IV????????????????????????????????? CITY SKYLINES AND HOI IV ARE CONNECTED, THE PUBLISHERS ARE COMPLETELY DIFFERENT (I totally got the game for free)"
333,the best building game i ever play
334,"burh

335,"Spiritual successor to SimCity.

The DLC policy is a bit predatory tho, wait for sales."
336,good game
337,"Addicting... What the Sim City series could have only dreamed of being. While I was initially cautious about buying a game with so much available DLC, I was quickly hooked, and slowly started acquiring more and more DLC. While I am not personally a fan of music DLCs, the others seem to be good additions. Hopefully it will continue to expand and encompass some new features. 

Some quirky AI things with traffic and import/export that can be resolved with mods like Traffic Manager, and additional road options from the workshop."
338,"its not working
"
339,"dlc is rather expensive, which would be fine if some elements of the game didnt seem rather difficult to work around without purchasing them. things like waste and traffic management are almost impossible to do efficiently without downloading mods or purchasing dlc. however, if you are able to mod your game, this is definitely one of the most addictive and calming games ive ever played. good buy."
340,good
341,"a modern classic, the dlc is annoying but there are endless community guides on which ones you need to download"
342,everytime i play i do good until everyone begins to die and the traffic clogs up from ambulances. 10/10
343,greate game
344,EXTREMELY HARD TO PLAY
345,the playtime speaks for itself. Sadly i cant really play it anymore because my old computer cant seem to load it these days  but I can recommend it.
346,bruh
347,"Really is the best city builder out there. I suck at it, I've never been good at city builders but I still love to play it. So much to do, so much to add with mods. And very rewarding when you see everything work out alright. 10/10 best in its field."
348,Such a fun game with ample additional packs both by cities skylines and fans of the game.
349,good stuff
350,"cool game
"
351,pog
352,good
353,"I've had this game since 2018 or 2019. When i started it was a bit hard but after a few days i figured it out, so its also easy to figure out ALL the controls, this was even on my own so no help no nothing. Now i have 475H playtime and 10+ DLC's wich make the game a whole new experience. Definitely recommend."
354,best game ver
355,"The game has many flaws. Transport, import and export, supply chain. Although I liked the look of the game I think there are a lot of unrealistic problems. Residential/commercial/industrial demands are crazy and you always have a city with more jobs than employees. Education levels change rapidly (it should be over the years). The traffic is stupid, 3 lanes on the street and the cars only use one of them. Transport does not follow the easiest access routes. On some maps, planes are used to transport oil, not rail."
356,"If you want to be an architech, this game isn't for you."
357,"Cities: Skylines is very fun, speaking as a type a person looking for entertaining ways to control the chaos in my life.  It is hard to understand and get started, but the guides and videos online help a lot and screwing around and messing things up also helps a lot.  I really enjoy the interface and think it's pretty easy to use.  I've played a few different city planning games and I think it's set up in a similar way.  If you've played Sim City or anything like that then you can easily grasp the basics of this game.  Great, very fun time sink!"
358,The best City Builder.
359,The Launcher for this game will brick you being able to play it the first time you exit and attempt to play again. Great game but cant play it so don't waste money.
360,dogshit
361,Is good
362,god game
363,fun but gets a little boring after reaching all milestones (which is quite easy)
364,"How many other games have 93% positive reviews with over 150k reviews over 7 years? Not many if any. It's obvious the game is great for its genre. It's great with or without mods, and with or without DLC that the devs are still pumping out. So should you be clicking on ""add to cart"" immediately? That depends. While the base game stands on its own well, most of the content DLC is fantastic....and expensive. My advise is...
 1.) WAIT FOR A STEAM SALE!!. The base game, along with all but the most recent DLC, is often drastically reduced during steam sales due to its age.
 2.)Unless you really really like it or have an exorbitant amount of disposable income, don't bother with the radio station or aesthetic DLCs because even with sale prices, the feature DLC packs will be costing plenty."
365,this game teach us how to be a city planner
366,"The greatest City builder ever created to date, shame the dlc cost a mortgage"
367,Allows for your own creativity.
368,Starship - We Built This City (Official Music Video) [HD]
369,Played this for a longtime and keep coming back time after time.  Great for city building and experimenting but can eat up a lot of time.
370,Incredible and super creative game! Mods are really cool and useful.
371,Best City game ever... ❤

-Too many DLC's causing the game to be quite expensive and also not allowing cross overs in DLC's
-Had to buy a better pc (unmodded 16GB of Ram is enough and a core i5 12500/ryzen 5
-Have to save it on your own and come up with your own names for the saves
-Some DLC's aren't that interesting or are hard to play with
-Currently there is a bug that makes you unable of turning intercity trains of

I myself like this game very much and have 500+ hours. And some DLC's are worth it like after dark and mass transit. Your first city will probably look like garbage but don't worry you'll get better. Also traffic is a big problem and you'll have to learn. But I would give this game a solid 9/10!"
399,game really gets my wiener hard
400,"This is a really fun game for those that like to build and make cities, hence the name. It takes a little while to get the hang of it and there is A LOT to learn, but if you have patience, you can really have fun with this game and do some innovative stuff. There is a lot of videos on YouTube on how to build and maintain your cities, plus there are a lot of DLCs for this game to add on the fun and there is a ton of MODs that you can fashion to your game to try stuff out. This is a great game/buy. Hope this helps!"

408,This is the most expensive game you can buy. $226.25 is what you're looking at if you dig into everything
409,very good game
410,Am sure you like spending 10 dollars for an extra building
411,Vehicle AI is still a mess.  The amount of micromanagement required is annoying.  In my opinion a game shoudn't require micromangement in order to be played.  it should always be an option for the player whether they want to micromanage.

414,👍
415,"Great successor to SimCity series, Would recommend."
416,lit
417,I set my city on fire :)
418,Good Game
419,Great Game. Satisfying to play.
420,"Top-tier game! 

Let's start with the freedoms you are given in designing your city: small town USA, metro downtown or even nonsensical layout with farms surrounded my industry and factories. The player is challenged with considering the needs of the cities sims as ""people"" such as transport and parks and the like, while balancing these ""soft factors"" with ""hard factors"" like industrial districts' layouts and the types of and routes of roads for optimal travel of goods and sims. I can wholeheartedly say that this game, and mechanics it implements, have given me new eyes when it comes to making sense of the city I live in IRL. 

The game is great at making you feel as if you are moving forward with a goal - a purpose. Invest enough time in the game and one starts to build a certain level of pride at the design they have laid out for their city. The economics of the game is such that it generally does not make sense to let money simply accumulate - what money is made simply gets put back into the game through new projects. A good city cannot help but get better!

I will say that it has some short-falls: 
1.) The rain texture is particularly grainy (even though I have a pretty decent pre-built)
2.)  the connection of some roads to one another may leave you wanting as it can be ""tricky"" to have complex shapes - I connected a roundabout to two exits at the same angle so that it would lead to highway and I got a f*cked up egg shape for my troubles
3.) The game can't help but keep progressing, unfortunately this is measured by population growth. Imagine recreating a mountain/mining community with a small town feel and minimal ""hustle and bustle"" but you can't build a hospital without having created a pretty sizeable city.
4.) It's a confusing and slow start - watching a Youtuber or having a friend guide you to start is a must (Shoutout to OVERCHARGED EGG!)

8.5/10 - get it now! (Join 63e in Holdfast while you're at it ;) )

439,By far the best city building game ever made.
440,Best city building game sense... Ever! Sim City who?
441,good
442,"A thousand hours and several years later:
You should play this game. Once, at least, as a ""vanilla"" experience, with only the expansions - read: not radio or creator content packs. If you're able to enjoy yourself, Congratulations!
Now you're ready to open the Workshop. Warning: There is SO MUCH GARBAGE in there, copy-cats, abandonware, and half-baked game-soul-destroying mods. Find some of the most trusted upgrade options (yes, they are upgrades) that will allow you to craft your most idyllic oasis society for simsouls to live out their short, monotonous, anonymous lives.
Now kiss your partner(s) and kid(s), and plan a vacation for them to get away from your inability to stop talking about this game, thinking about how you can fix that intersection or add production to the industry zone. Traffic. Sewage Management. Worse Traffic. Natural Disaster timed beautifully; it will make you swear YOU pushed the ""make it rain hellfire on my new emergency response center"" button. Mindblowing, productivity-killing, unashamed of its destructive yet addictive attraction - Traffic!

There was a City Sim before and since, sure. That's more of a bubble-gum carefree teen with homework. This is the 9 to 5, overtime and weekends, deadlines you didn't even know about, high-pressure career makers and breakers professional.

So, play it. Make it your best experience however you dream of doing it. Play with the parks, create traffic problems just to create more beautiful highway interchanges (Divergent Diamond Exchanges are erotica, prove me wrong), or just complete the quiet Thomas Kincade-would-be-proud-hamlet in the valley below the snow.

Enjoy your time.

477,"This is a really fantastic city simulator. Its simple yet beautiful. You can grow your city however you want. Make it a green Utopia dedicated to the great outdoors or a polluted hellscape dedicated to only that sweet dollar. The choice is 100% yours. 

As this is a Paradox game you should be aware that wild glitches and an insane DLC policy are prevalent. The DLCs do make the game better generally and so are worth it, although they tend to be a little over priced. There are a multitude of weird glitches however, such as garbage trucks and corps collectors sending out only one or two cars each while your city is littered with trash and the dead. There is no reason for this glitch and it has been present since release day. Its still lots of fun, just be ready for some annoying stuff like that to pop up from time to time."
478,epik
479,"This is not SimCity - and it does take a few mods, and a lot of practise to get anything functional never mind profitable cities.

But.. if you do have some good progress.. I've played much much worse. 

You need to like managing the smallest details, and wait for effects...a  lot.

So not recommended to all... just a niche.

498,"I would not consider this a game. It's more of a city simulation. There aren't a lot of game elements to it and you usually just spend most of your time managing traffic. The game does not feel complete without buying the $222 worth of DLC. Paradox just keeps releasing new DLC each year and instead of making a better version of this game they just keep coining on the fact that they are considered the best city builder ""game."""

In all seriousness, I really enjoy the game.  I love the control I have over building and managing my cities.  I love the mods, that brings the game to a whole new level.

523,I stopped playing this after a short time of first getting it because I got frustrated with road transitions from highway to roads. Just started playing it again because I got a moment of intelligence and watched instructional videos when I was stuck in game. Now I enjoy playing.

542,"Very in depth, always something to do and think about. My favorite game right now"
543,best game ever. even better than the sims and i have 800 hours of sims on origin
544,Yes!
545,"awesome game that allows you to create your own city and explore creativeness, definitely recommend this game"
546,"Its the experience of playing 5 hours strait and making the city of your dreams. Worth all the money i spent on it and its DLC and yes there are a lots of DLCs. Some less worth than others but all have a use
Modding is a strong part of this game it has a great mod community and some of the best content creators
inproving some key parts of the game but the game by itself is the best in its class.

547,Hands down ultimate city builder.
548,its very fun and addicting
549,This Is A Very Fun And Interactive Game About Building Your Own City. I Would Recomend This To All Who Have A Good Imagination
550,this game is best especially for Civil engineers
551,"Cities Skylines is the best city building and management game since SIM City. Full stop.

The progression loop is engaging. Learning, re-crafting, and redesigning is essential, and always rewarded.

The atmosphere is wonderful. You can settle in with a small town and look at the clock and realize your once 500 pop city is now 5000, but, it is 1AM.

Mods are not absolutely necessary but when bought on sale revitalized and revolutionized a few less than perfect facets of gameplay such as public transportation.

The content some have created is beyond comprehension. T

he artist/engineer/traffic juggling roundabout guru in you will be unlocked for many hours and into the night.

Highly recommend."
552,Can't recommend the game when it's locked behind a $200+ paywall. It's old and as another said; include everything and sell it for $60.
553,"it is a city making game id recommend for people who love seeing numbers go up and stuff
"

555,"If Morbius has a million fans, I am one of them. If Morbius has 5 fans, I am one of them. If Morbius has one fan, That one is me. If Morbius has no fans, I am no longer alive. If the world is against Morbius, I am against the world. Till my last breath, I'll love Morbius (2022)."

558,"I love the game but HATE that there is so much DLC. Probably will not purchase any DLC other than Disasters, but definitely worth the playthtough. Avoid the DLC. Money sink"
559,"A very powerful simulator and fun game. the price is high, but the game is a step above."
560,love it
561,"Recommended for players who [b]REALLY[/b] love city management and a challenge. It's not a game that I'd recommend as someone's first City Builder. Your cities will fail a lot at the beginning and that's OK! You'll hopefully be able to learn and the next one will last longer. I think I had 6 failed cities before I had my first successful one [strike]that was then destroyed by a tsunami, but ya know small victories[/strike]

There are [b]A LOT of factors[/b] that affect your city and it's not always apparent which one is failing when you start having little popups. 

[i]For example: ""Land Value is Too Low"" there's a filter to show the value of a land from low to high but sometimes this pop up occurs even over land that's all the way up to HIGH. So you have to look at parks, health facilities, education facilities, taxes, budget for all those facilities, pollution nearby, job opportunities, public transport etc etc. And it can be ANY of those or multiple of those and you won't know until you problem solve it.[/i]

[b]I love to problem solve so this is amazing for me[/b] but it's not for everyone.
Be sure to look up videos to help! There are a number of content creators who will release tutorials and guides that will help you get going and not fail 5 minutes after pressing play.
[hr][/hr]

If you loved Sim City for it's goofiness or the ability to pick up and play without immediately failing then this game [b]may not[/b] be for you. 

If you love problem solving complex problems, learning through failure, and managing cities then this game is probably right up your alley way.

562,"base game is still good without dlcs, but I still reccomend buying some"
563,Good for City
564,"OK refresh of sim city but seriously overpriced, thankfully it comes with a launcher to grab your data, the second best thing about the launcher is that it breaks on every platform and stays broken, no really see: https://support.paradoxplaza.com/hc/en-us/articles/360010684620-My-launcher-doesn-t-work-my-game-wont-start-"

571,nice
572,This is a great game. New updates dropped regularly. I find it a great way to de stress after a long day stuck in traffic.
573,I started playing this game on the console.  Those abilities quickly faded and I longed to play on the pc.  I finally had a device that I could use to play and quickly outgrew that device as well.  I gave up on the game for some time until I got an updated pc and felt I could play this game again.  Its a pretty damn nice rig and once again Ive hit a brick wall with this game and am having severe issues and every attempt at a correction leads me nowhere.  I think I am done with this game once again.
574,"The best city builder game out there, period! I have it on PlayStation, Switch and PC and with all the expansions on all of them... enough said! :o)"
575,if you liked sim city as a kid this is a modern day version that is more fun.

590,"Default game is worth the money for a casual, chill experience. The DLCs are hit or miss, more often a hit than a miss. Buy them on sales. The real seller is the modding community and the dev's willingness to support mods and modders. I have 1500+ hours in modded Skyrim, and the only game out there that has mod support and a positive modding community that comes even close, is Cities: Skylines."

597,This game is awsome!
598,I CHANGED MY GARAPCHS AND MY H|GASME CRASHED AND I LOST EVERYTHING HOURS OF PROGRESS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! DONT INSTALL!!!!
599,You can lost in this game and how in depth it is.
600,Great for mind creativity
601,"This game is really fun actually, you can build your dream cities, but also you stumble upon some puzzles that require you to think; Like the traffic problems you might experience every now and then. The Traffic is a pain in the, you know.. 

I feel like the standard version without dlc is pretty boring after a while.
I've bought Natural Disasters, and I can safely say that rebuilding your cities after destroying them is quite fun lol
Mods definitely improve the game experience. Im having alot of fun with them.

One thing though, I appreciate the hard-work the devs put into this game, but the DLC's are quite overpriced. 
I cannot bother having to pay like over 100 SEK when I barely have any money left over. 

Overall the game is a 8.5/10"
602,"Great Job

603,very good very nice

607,"Cities Skylines is a relaxing, fun and a satisfying game that allows your creative city planner ooga booga brain to create whatever you desire. It could be an american style suburban neighbourhood. It could have a spaghetti or a grid design. It could be a masterful drawing of your dog... or it could just be a living hell. The creativity is only limited by your imagination and also probably your knowledge.

The difficulty comes when you want to design an actual functional city, because it does require you to take a few baby steps before you plan on doing so, or else your city would just be a traffic clogged mess (most likely). My advice would be to try out different techniques and to also learn a bit about city planning and traffic managing. Biffa Plays, City Planner Plays and YUMBLtv are great examples of YouTube channels who teaches this kind of stuff, so if you're unsure about certain things, go check them out. You could also install mods like Traffic Manager: President Edition, Road Anarchy, Precision Engineering etc.
You could also make the game even more difficult by either disabling the in-game mods, or subscribing to mods that will make your game a bit tougher.

Overall, Cities Skylines is a fun game that allows you to explore the concept of city planning, or create the most suffering out of your citizens. It's fun to play around with, and I can never truly get enough of this game. It is also very nice that the game supports mods, all though it can sometimes be a bit buggy. I would definitely recommend this game, and if I could rate this, I would give it a 9/10."

619,Used to play the game for 10000's of hours and have great fun then all of a sudden the game will no longer load and has tons of problems.  Will be speaking to my bank about reversing all charges and if I have had the time I'd sue just for my loss of hours!!!!

628,good game
629,Very good alternative to SimCity
630,fire game... always good to pass some time :)
631,"This game offers a lot in terms of creative freedom. It's beginner friendly in that it's easy to get the hang of and get started, but also has a lot to offer players that take the time to really dive deep and make the most out of their city."
632,"I used to play Sim City a lot and stumbled upon this game looking for tutorials. I am not an avid gamer, but I enjoy the time I spend with the games I have. This is the game I've played the most out of all my library and I still can't believe how good it is and how much stuff I still have ahead. After all this playing, I can agree with most of the reviews about the DLCs and the price, but, as some say, if you snatch the game on sale and play vanilla for a while, it's a nice way of understanding the dynamics of the game and then, make up what you think the game lacks with DLCs or mods. I personally enjoy vanilla all the way. But after getting into rabbit holes of the game, I truly understand why people would like to change things here and there. My opinion is based on all the time I spent with Sim City in the past, thinking that game truly lacked some gameplay and being dumbfounded when this game came into my life. It surprised me how much detail went into this game. I loved it then and still love it now. To this day I think its the best city builder game ever made."
633,"Yeah good game. No actually, maybe the best city builder yet. Playtime confirms."
634,"jake has less than 15% happiness
"
635,"This game has been the king of it's genre for 5+ years, and the content (including community content and mods) is deep enough to justify that. 

Unfortunately, the full experience with expansions (Public Transport and Industries are critical IMO) is $200+, but the playtime you can get for that cost somewhat justifies it."
636,"Best city builder there is, great modding and lots of time wasted."
637,Great game
638,I've played for MONTHS on PS4 - and recently moved onto playing on my mac. Which can JUST about cope with it at a basic level. It's SO MUCH better on a computer rather than a console. LOVE IT!

Awful garbage"
642,"got an urge to play it again, checked my library and remembered why i stopped playing. Base games fine but alot of fun stuff (alongside achievements) are locked behind dlc. Wouldn't mind that to much normally but base game is 28€. Dlc's are 258€. Even on sale it doesn't get into a reasonable area."
643,"Só o fato desse jogo ter monopolizado de maneira tão forte o gênero de construção de cidade, já se entende que ele não só entrega o que promete como permite ir muito além. Contudo, a falta de optimização (jogo com uma RTX3050, um processador I5 de 11ª geração e, mesmo assim, a velocidade da simulação cai significantemente após uma população de +/- 20.000 hab.) e a NECESSIDADE de DLC's para uma experiência minimamente completa são elementos que não se podem ignorar pro consumidor que pensa em destinar parte de sua renda com ele. 

Recomendo o jogo, mas reforço com bastante ênfase que suas falhas técnicas, apesar de poucas, são extremamente relevantes pr'aqueles usuários que poderiam destinar seu dinheiro pr'um outro jogo base mais completo e optimizado que este."
644,If you like City building and like to efficiently run traffic than you should definitely buy Cities Skylines
645,Love this sim game. the interface to building and understanding whats happening in the city makes it so fun to play and tinker with your city
646,It's Great
647,"It's another one of these games that i have to give them a negative review, even though the game itself is great and all but its very basic if you dont have any DLC, and you miss out a lot of what the game has to offer, and the game has so many DLCs and each one of them is very expensive. it's a shame."
648,"It has been a very positive gameplay experience and I would suggest anyone who likes sim games to try it. There is a  little bit of nostalgia bias for me, since I used to play Simcity!
Positives: A GREAT GAME.

The positives are always pleasant for everyone. I am not going to stick with that. I believe you d like to read my ""negative game aspects"". 
I don't want to waste your time, so here they are:
a) I think the game opens up new options too fast and too broad for beginner players. At the start of the game you got: lets say 5 available buildings, and not before too long you got tons of new buildings simultaneously.
b) I am annoyed by the frequency of  reminders such as: You got this new building option etc.

c) I would like to know how things benefit me as a player. For example, I understand the city needs a taxi system. But if the city is not profiting at all from it, and the need for ""houses and such"" is enormous, why would I want to build anything at all. In other words , the game lucks an apparent investment/reward explanation. If you don't like the taxi example , replace it with fishing industry etc. I love fish but as a player, I would like to know why would i want to build it. Same with post office and so on.

d) I don't like the fact that , when I re-purpose an area or upgrade from low residential to high residential all the new comers are ignorant fools who need to go to elementary school (but still! they can afford luxurious apartments). 

e) For the complete set of Dlcs/ full experience ( even with discounts) the game is expensive.

f) I understand a public operated Metro, but not all transportation means should be supported by the city authorities (again! I am talking about you taxi drivers!)

Ps: I have no motive to have a taxi system although I use it. I do however have a great park, which is larger than the city itself (and that here  is a motive) I love creating parks (and that is quality gaming time with some profit for the city builder)."
649,"I've apparently played this game for nearly 4000 hours. I'm still playing it. I absolutely love this game, even though I came to it quite late considering it was released in 2015. 
I think the best way for new players to figure out how this game works would be to NOT download the entire contents of the workshop mods and assets for the first few hours at least - then you'll know what vanilla behaviours of the game you want to change. 
The base game and DLC are definitely worth it, and whilst it's no 'The Sims' if you were to buy everything at once, it could be a bit daunting if you're not prepared for it. Get the DLCs one at a time or when they're on offer. Personally I haven't bothered with the radio stations as I find them a bit annoying in general, and I can always have Youtube or music playing if i want noise.
There is no right or wrong way to build a city. There is no point at which you win. Your benchmark may be developing your city to a certain threshold in terms of money (there is a simplistic economy in this game) or growing your population to a Metropolis or whatever. Or maybe you just want to master traffic. Or you may be one of those talented people that can spend an absolute age on a single city and make it stunningly beautiful - that's definitely not me!
To make it to your own version of winning, you'll probably want to use the workshop for mods or assets, and there some incredible versions of both. You will probably find whatever you want has been created and is ready for a free download at the expense of a thumbs up and a thanks. If somehow you have thought of something nobody has created yet, there is an asset editor built into the game.
I would heartily recommend this game and it's massive Workshop collection, and a number of Youtube creators who still make amazing videos of this game. 
It can be rather resource hungry, and without mods the graphics are a bit meh, but with the right mods, assets and settings, it can still look fantastic, even though it's now 7 years old"

718,"TLDR: traffic is game breakingly bad

Seldom do I see a game with so much time, money, and effort put into it fail on something so core, so vital to its operation so much as to render it a bad game. 
Imagine minecraft but mobs just don't move, or mario without powerups, there's still a whole game full of features, but it is fundamentally hindered by this lack of completeness.

This is what Cities: Skylines suffers from, a core tenant of its gameplay, hell, a core tenant of real life city planning: roads and traffic, is broken.
Enough beating around the bush, how is it that you can fail at roads so bad? Well, in real life, a road with more than 1 lane each way will fill up on all lanes, lets say you want to turn right 2 miles from now, you might start heading twards the right lane but there's no rush to actually go into it yet, but in Cities: Skylines? if you want to make a right turn, weather that be in 20 feet or the other side of the city, you stay in the right lane, middle lanes be damned. Worse still, cars don't care about how much traffic there is when making their routes, so you can have a 6 lane freeway with no cars on it, but because some cramped side street is half a mile shorter, ALL your cars, and trucks and buses and any other wheeled mobility device will jam up this poor little road only ever meant to allow people in the suburbs to drive to the store.

There is a simple solution to this: design your entire city with one way roads made to go a very few directions and have no non-essential access points
I am intimately familiar with superblocks, and I think they're great in real life when being designed by a person who gets paid to do so, but I find no joy in trying to rack my brain over how I'm going to expand my city with one way streets without breaking my previous work. 

More than anything else, im just disappointed, because every other aspect of this game is either tolerable or good, even the DLC creep I can stand, but just not the fundamental flaw of bad traffic in a game about citybuilding"
719,ok idk ok
720,best city builder around alot of dls now but well worth the cash

727,do yourself a favor and just buy it
728,i make crap cities for people to live in
729,"I love the detail the game goes into which gives you different levels of management. The city keeps you on your toes as you try to keep everything afloat. I'm having difficulty landscaping at the moment as I learn the tools. I'm thoroughly enjoying this game, be sure you have a lot of time though as you can just get lost in this awesome game."
730,kjj
731,"I will strongly recommend this game for those who inspire to plan and organise city and enjoy their creativity come to life. There is so much to do and explore in this game that will keep you engrossed for days, if not hours. I just love this game !!!"
732,dugs bawz
733,great game
734,"best city builder on the market, new players will struggle with traffic"
735,great
736,Very good game
737,"I think I got off at the wrong stop, I understand civil engineering and the finer points of road hierarchy"
738,"As a city building sim, skylines excels offer up what sim city should have been.
Obviously as it's a little older now the engine has some performance issues but the game play extends past these frustrations and the workshop community fixes a lot of issues that the game in it's current state has.
As a casual gamer, it's relaxing and has a lot of replay value."
739,Fun City Build time make house people die trash no get picked up.
740,Its pretty Free Robux
741,good game
742,no life i will have
743,"The gameplay is very detailed and the modding community is always on top of their game. Love the customizability, and the music is top-notch also."
744,"good



"
745,great game
746,"Great game, it is relaxing to play and offers a ton of variety. It is easy to play, but hard to master. As you play more you will find yourself stressing about garbage routes and traffic congestion. But you can always just let your city go to Sh*t (there are even rewards for that)  or call in an asteroid to wipe it out. It's all good!"
747,Amazing city builder game recomend for people who want to have a challenge and for people who want to learn how these games work
748,I cause human pain and suffering with cholera
749,Ideal for long evenings. Lacks multiplayer.
750,"I'm really torn between the amazing gameplay Cities: Skylines offers and the terrible price politics it comes with. I got the game in a humble bundle back in the day and am playing with the base game and the Green Cities DLC only. None of the DLCs are essential, but you really do feel how restricted the base game becomes - once you see the possibilities if only you had i.e. the Mass Transit DLC for a better infrastructure. Or the Industries DLC, making industry areas more fun than just zoning and applying a theme to them. But I'm not willing to pay more than 5$/€ for these extra contents - especially since I already bought the base game. 

With that being said, I have lots of fun with mods enhancing the game - so so much. You'll invest so much more time in little details - it becomes really immersive. Yet it will be tricky and your PC should be beefed up to be able to play it in a somewhat stable way. And troubleshooting can take plenty of time and nerves. I'm experiencing lots of crashes given the amount of mods installed and it is literally roasting my RAM from time to time. No fault of the game per se - but it wouldn't be necessary if a paying consumer wouldn't be forced resorting to those instead of feeding the publisher more money for contents, that are clearly overpriced.

Gameplaywise however, it is super fun. No doubt about that. With every new city you start you'll learn more stuff like road hierarchies and more ideal zoning. You'll get lost in detailling and landscaping or trying to figure out why a roundabout isn't always the best solution to your crappy road structures and crossings. All these individual options are adding to the replay-value of Cities: Skylines. 

In the end this makes me recommend the game. My advice though: Get the basegame on sale and keep an eye out for DLC-rankings on Youtube and check what exactly they're adding to the game. Decide on one or two DLCs to add once you get bored with it. Or if you're comfortable with the Steam Workshop, check that out. Adding more road options, buidling(s/ themes) and some general quality of life mods like the Picker mod, the Move it! mod or TM:PE  and you are quite set for hours of additional fun."
751,Nice
752,FUN GAME HAS LOTS OF GOOD STUFF
753,"Traffic AI is retarded it will ruin the game for you unless you want to download a better traffic mod and make the game your job.

Not enough freedom to chill and build up slowly. The game is designed in a way that makes cities implode on themselves unless you know exactly what you are doing."

756,noice i saved my real life town with this
757,"it's a very good way to have some stress free gaming, if you don't try and make everything perfect

"
758,good
759,Great game worth every penny.
760,.
761,"This game has had the exact same horrendous performance issues since day 1, disgusting ugly aliasing (even upscaled or with AA) I've ever seen in my life, and the ridiculous number of ""expansions"" they charge you for instead of optimizing and finishing the game.... I'm basically sickened by the developers lack of effort.  

It's been out for years.  Selling copies.  Fixing nothing.  

I have upgraded my PC 3 times since it came out.  Today I'm running it on a very up to date PC, which I upgrade every time something new comes out.  Every other game I play runs flawlessly 144fps without even trying.  This game has the same FPS, same quality of graphics, and same crashing, and stuttering - that it had when I first got it years ago.  

This will be the last time I install it and give it a chance.  
And it's a shame because the gameplay is really good.  But I can't condone a scam like this.

No i do not recommend.  

And that's all I have to say about that."
762,Great game for the creatives
763,"It's pretty, has the right level of complexity to it, and was complex enough to keep my mind engaged for hours. If you feel like building a city without gimmicks or pressure, this is a good game for it."
764,"Love this game to bits, I've played way too much of it. But these days, every time a new DLC releases I can't help but thinking about how dated the graphics, specifically the lighting looks. Don't get me wrong, this is still the best city builder out there by a long shot, If you haven't played it and you like the genre, you simply have to try this game. 

Nonetheless, I can't wait for the true next gen city builder that I really believe Colossal Order can deliver. By going back to simcity 4 + colossal addon mod, you can see what this game lacks. It needs more growth stages, finer granularity in land value mechanics and a more accurate representation of scale. Imagine if those skyscrapers would be as imposing as they were in sc4 and as varied in height and shapes... Imagine if they'd have a regional economic and demand system comparable to SC4's, but with all the resource management intricacies that CS has... 

I wouldn't mind giving up the agent simulation or the ability to zoom at street level if it could help bringing about those important features that we haven't seen in a modern city builder yet. I love that this game is still doing so good but they are pretty much on par with EA and The Sims with all the DLCs at this point... And that is scary to say the least."
765,"Beautiful sandbox for creation, modding community is amazing. Such a relaxing game, I just love it."
766,"Sometimes the place goes dark and I can't see anything. It isn't night, as many days are going by. 
It is like they tried to messed up your ability to see in the game for no reason. 

Playing this game is like trying to do everything without your dominate hand. It kind of works, but it is not smooth.

I give it a thumbs up though because there aren't many games you can make a container port in."
767,"the best single player game that i even played. The whole game is have 80% realistic vibe, traffic jams, etc...."
768,"Excellent and ever-improving realism. The usually elegant complexity of a Paradox game. Allows one to live the fantasy: ""That bus stop shouldn't be so close to that traffic light!"" (click, drag, move) ""That's better!"" If only I could do that in real life... I walk around a city all day, thinking ""this place is SO poorly designed"" and I get home and I can right the wrongs of city planning!"
769,Amazing Game For Player to build cities
770,cities are cool i like them
771,nothing to dislike. some mods are needed for the best experience
772,I remember my childhood this game city builder and now same i ever play long time
773,Cool building game

781,"This is more of a ""toy"" than a game. There's no way to win - you just keep playing with it. But with that in mind, it's a great toy. The simulation is amazing - every person literally has a home, a job or a school, a schedule, etc. Unbelievable that this much simulation can run on a laptop at 60fps. 5 stars!"
782,"best sim game...
"
783,"Paradox insists on pushing more and more DLCs that do stuff already available through mods instead of starting a new with an updated engine like this game very clearly needs. Was a good game when it came out and for the subsequent years, and nowadays it still is the top citybuilder but only because it has no direct competitors."
784,"I adore this game and all the DLC that has since come forth. Constantly amazed at the cities crafted by Biffa and CPP. I can't come close to their creativity, but this game scratches a city building itch I've had for many years."
785,"The graphics look good, the game has a smooth frame rate, and there's no shortage of content to check out. Well worth the money spent. 10/10"
786,you can separate rich and poor people

808,"Yes, yes, and yes."
809,best addiction I ever got for 5 bucks
810,This game is exquisite. Simply beuatiful and is some of Paradox's best work. Since I played I have been cured of depression and terminal stage 5 hair cancer. My wife came back with the kids. I won the lottery and my idol cam back to life. But the traffic system pissed me off. 9/11.
811,"It's not a bad game but the base game has nothing in it and the only way to get a good version of it is to get a bundle from humble bundle or somewhere else where you can get a large amount of DLCs for a very large discount. I kind of wish I would have looked into it to find out it was a paradox game. Terrible developer/publishing company, Data farms and DLC generators is what they deal in, not games"
812,"i love this game, beware game is not fun if u dont buy dlcs, that paradox"
813,game will not load nor play. thinking of getting my money back

826,i like it
827,"c'est cool quand on sait pas quoi faire
"
828,Very fun and relaxing game
829,"The game is great. Not that realistic, but fun, engaging, and a good time killer. I love city building games and I believe the developers are still adding more content. One little problem though, one of the expansion packs, specifically the airport one, has been lacking a lot of features and I'm gonna recommend you don't buy it."
830,Good Game
831,This is one of the best city building game.  Way more complex than Simcity.  It's about time to have a sequel.
832,"Pros:
- Surprisingly enjoyable and relaxing to build a city
- Very cool visuals that make it feel like a real city
- Lots of replay value

Cons:
- Paradox game (1000 fucking dlcs)
- Late game is basically traffic management simulator
- Dogshit education system (takes way to long for people to get educated
- Very difficult to comprehend all of the different mechanics
- Forced paradox launched (with no consent from the user given at all)

6.5/10"
833,10/10 its hard to start but when you get the hag of it its fun
834,"""Ah heck i forgot a clinic"" - me"
835,its a good game to play if you have a lot of spare time as it can be very time consuming setting up your city
836,It definitely has cities and skylines. 10/10 exactly what was promised
837,i may have built a city or two
838,The Game is so laggy on a 2013 Mac Catalina
839,"Honestly a great game, however it was not conducive to my marriage. I had to sell my wedding ring to afford the DLC. I've spend so much time playing that I had not showed up for work or spent time with my family. Cities: Skylines made me lose my job and kids! All I have to show for it is an ugly highway interchange."
840,its alright
841,"Addicting and fun. Takes a bit to get used to the game and its design, but after you do, it's amazing"
842,"Would be an amazing game, if you didn't have to spend almost $300 to experience everything!"
843,noice
844,yes
845,Best city building game out there!!
846,WE NEED CITIES SKYLINES 2！！！

848,classism simulator is fun
849,"Too much expensive DLC and overall for a game from 2015 it doesn't run great. However, this game is arguably the best of its kind. Get a bundle on sale. VERY relaxing when that is the type of game you need."
850,yes
851,10 stars
852,Very great game! <3

854,"I like that there are multiple ways to ""play"" this game. From ""collect all the awards possible"" to ""I want to make and exact copy of the city I live in"" to "" what would the 'perfect' city would look like"". With new DLC'c and Content Creator packs it will be a long time before I run out of new things to try."
855,"Hands down best city builder ever made, with limitless content to be added through dlc and mods. This is the game I wish Sim City could've been back in the day. My only complaint is the traffic is a little TOO realistic therefore can prove a challenge for even the best city planners! So realistic it should be used in engineering school to teach people proper city planning techniques. 10/10"
856,Great City Builder.
857,"It's a disguised traffic puzzle game.
Also, trains 👍"
858,"Put a lot of hours into this game when I had it on console, and its still as much fun to play here like it was on console.
You like building sims, but hate needing them to be constantly online? Like 'that one' certain city building simulator?

CS has you on that. All the offline play you could ask for in the world."
859,An overall good game
860,Why is the music so raucus?
861,don't buy it because you can get it on steamlocked all DLCs for free and you need a besrt of a pc to play it just buy on xbox or PS
862,Need I say more?
863,why do my citizens hate me? is it because everyone around them are dying because of a disease in the drinking water which is actually sewage water? nah it has to be because we have no ice cream trucks!

869,good
870,I like building things. There is so much you can do... still learning :)
871,after 7 years and 350 hours i can safely say the game is pretty good :)
872,Killing my citizens is fun lmao
873,"This game is so fun I love it! You can make any city you want. You can make Dubai,New York, Berlin, and many more cities. There are thousands of mods, assets and lots of more fun things you can get from the Steam Workshop. This game also has great sales. The price can go down to $8 I would wait for the sale it's worth it. I've played this game for 933 hours because this game is so fun! You can also make your own assets and mods for free so if you want to make a mod feel free to. I really recommend this to people that love city building. I hope you enjoy the game<"
874,verry fun but a bit expecive
875,"My city is burning, it's rampant with crime, but at least i'm earning 5000 a month 👍"

878,Awesome game ever
879,gud game
880,esta wueno pero es injugable sin mods (sinceramente)
881,realistic
882,The best city building and design game.  You can design your own city beautifully and make unique designs for yourself.  One of my top 5 games for me.  (I recommend you to play by installing mods and assets.)
883,"If you're looking for a review on this game you've come to the wrong place, but if you're looking for an outstanding pie recipe you've come to the right place.

Ingredients:

1. 6 tablespoons unsalted butter
2. 1/2 cup white sugar
3. 1/2 cup brown sugar
4. 1/4 cup water
5. 1/4 teaspoon cinnamon
6. 1 pinch salt
7. 5 apples - peeled, cored and sliced
8. 1 pastry for double-crust pie

Directions:

1. Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C).
2. Combine butter, white sugar, brown sugar, water, cinnamon, and salt in a saucepan over medium heat. Bring to a boil, remove from heat and set aside.
3. Roll out half the pastry to fit a 9-inch pie plate. Place bottom crust in pie plate; pour in apple slices.
4. Roll out top crust into a 10-inch circle. Cut into 8 (1-inch) wide strips with a sharp paring knife or pastry wheel. Weave the pastry strips, one at a time, into a lattice pattern. Fold the ends of the lattice strips under the edge of the bottom crust and crimp to seal.
5. Pour butter-sugar mixture over top of pie, coating the lattice, and allowing any remaining sauce to drizzle through the crust.
6. Bake in the preheated oven for 15 minutes. Reduce heat to 350 degrees (175 degrees C), and bake until the crust is golden brown, the caramel on the top crust is set, and the apple filling is bubbling, 35 to 40 more minutes. Allow to cool completely before slicing."

895,Amazing Game and DLC. Only one thing is missing... a multiplayer to work with friends into 1 city.
896,"I used to love this game but I have now grown to hate it.

Endless DLC's releases breaking the game but devs refuse to fix broken game engine. Game is unplayable and extremely buggy. Paradox/CO should have released a sequel years ago but instead decided to release DLC's Pandering to particular groups and ignoring the majority.  I hope EA or another Publisher brings out some competition so this game can finally die.

After poor treatment by their mods team I have also decided to boycott all paradox titles going forward. They can thank their mod team for that. I guess spending hundreds of pounds on DLC gets you no loyalty from this greedy publisher."
897,Great relaxing game!
898,Basically Tony Hawk's pro skater but with buildings

906,"Every time I want to play this game I want to relax, but every time I end up fixing traffic. Anyways, If you enjoy reading theories about traffic flow, feats of engineering, or trying to build suburbs with optimal amenity placement, then you will love this game! If you always wanted to have one of those little villages that weird old people build in their garage, but you hate the smell of burning Styrofoam, then this is also your game.
Thanks for reading

907,good game
908,"yes, flooding exists if you want it to be flooded, so yes game good 10/10 and yeah fun game"
909,I love this game. I always wanted to build a city in a game and this is exactly what I wanted! you really can build any type of city you can think of!
910,"I had a lot of fun playing this game. Unfortunatelly me eyes start to hurt after an hour of looking at screen. Which is a shame, because I really want to play more. Anyway I am sure that any fun on citybuilding will enjoy this one."

926,bro its so hard
927,"Although it is a decent game after you learn how to play, there is no tutorial so the learning curve is very tedious, and the game is very incomplete without paying for DLC's, or getting mods, and the grind can take hours depending on your skill level, too bad I played too much while researching how to play."
928,Yes
929,"lol i have way too many hours on this game. if you dont have a good computer u will get very bad frames but install the mods mini fps booster, less steam and most importantly speed slider to be able to still do things. i am on a good computer now but i played on a 2012 macbook air on 5 fps for 800 of these hours so its possible but not as fun."
930,"games realy good, but if you ever see a youtuber play it, they have all the dlcs witch cost a LOT of money. the games fun. but there are to many paid dlcs."

948,"Awesome game, but:

The DLC is a big thing in this game, but you can download mods to replace DLCs. If you are ok with DLCs, take time before buying, watch somes videos on Youtube because not all DLCs are good. in my opinion each person have differents type of DLC who love and dont.

The game is really fun and you can do whatever you want. The best thing is to learn by yourself by playing.
In the beginning I was not capable of playing, but try it, it is wort it!

I recommend playing Anno1800 from Ubisoft for a different type of gameplay.

"
949,"cool game

963,bankruptcy
964,"very good 
"
965,Great for those who grew up playing SimCity 4
966,"Great city building game, absolutely tons of paid dlc. The game itself is great, but maybe incorporate a dlc or two into the base game, or make them less expensive."
967,My friend showed me this game and I created a STEAM account just to play it ~ my first PC game of my very own and I'm so so sooo happy about it!
968,road
969,best city builder
970,"I love the resource management that this game has to offer, unlike a variety of resources, this game focuses the management of people."
971,how to have sex with my city?
972,"Well Sir, or Miss... I like it."
973,look this game is good but it would be even better if there was multiplayer with trades and wars
974,Very fun modern city builder that does its Sim City ancestors justice
975,"Nice little bit of zen in building your own worlds. The only complaint I have is that the road building is not as easy as it should be especially in making hairpin turns for switchbacks, it takes way too much time to go down a steep mountain with a road, whereas we have many roads of this sort in the NW and you just can't build them in the game. yes that is using mods like Precision Engineering, Move IT, and Fine Road Tools.
"
976,amazing!
977,"Since I was a teenager (and now i'm almost 40), I've been such a big fan of simulation games. Specially the city building and managing ones.
This is the most complete, real and perfect game on this category.
ENjoy!"
978,Really like it! Prevents me from crying from situations that im in
979,Hands down the best city builder / sim game out there to date -- makes it give the realism effect!
980,"My real city sucks. It has too many cars, not enough green, and not enough public transit, but at least I can make a nice one in this game."
981,
982,This is perfect
983,"fun a made a poocano

984,Why I can type a review?
985,Better then sim city
986,Seems like a nice game. Problem is it crashes every time I play it.
987,Game good very building
988,very niice
989,"Great successor to Sim City. A little daunting at first, but once you figure it out you can build some amazing cities. However, some content that i would consider pretty basic is locked behind a pay wall."
990,ye
991,"This is the pinnacle of city builder right now imo. The game is very addicting and very kind to modding. because of that the game itself is growing overtime, either from the mod community or the DLC paradox provide. I strongly recommend this game if you love managing games or you just want to replicate real cities!"
992,saya sangat menikmati gamenya.
993,Just a lovely game!
994,it is fun
995,"A wonderful game with a huge mod community. Endless maps, tools, mods and replay potential. I love to watch my cities come to life as the music soars. There is plenty of complexity but it is very rewarding to figure out how your city works."
996,"After I finish my long days full of work and shitting myself in Overwatch, Cities: Skylines is a game I can rely on that will keep me relaxed yet engaged."
997,"Not just a great game, but with the right mods, also a great city planning simulator for hobbyists like me. Who would've thought that designing infrastructure, intersections and urban places would be so much fun?
DLC's add great new content to the game, but they're pretty expensive. Unless you're a Saudi prince, I recommend buying them when they're on sale (you can sometimes get them for a really affordable price on Humble Bundle)."
998,"If you're into city builder games, you'll love this game to the point where you're either playing it, or planning and researching ways to make your city better. It has the ""one more turn"" energy of Civ 5. The DLCs add a lot of stuff, some of which feels like it should had been in the base game. Snag them in the next steam sale.
Do It. Join us."

1000,Love Cities
1001,amazing
1002,Amazing
1003,This game is the best game I've played in the genre of city building games. There is an active builder and modding community improving the game bit by bit. I would recommend this game to anyone interested in civil engineering and/or management style games.

1006,Fun game. I like its potential but you need the DLCs to get the best experience.

1012,I've been playing city builders since I was like 8 with Sim City 4. Cities Skylines is the best city builder ever. 100/100
1013,"Honestly, one of if not the best city builder I've played since SimCity 4: Rush Hour."

1025,"I've been playing Sim City games for as long as I can remember. Cities Skylines is a great continuation of the city building platform. And while the vanilla game might not be the most exciting, there are mods that help the game flow.

Cities Skylines, Aka Parking Lot simulator."
1026,Its fun. You should probably buy DLC with it because otherwise it is way too hard to play. Also it's more fun

Building a functioning roundabout became my number one priority in life for a while haha."
1056,good game
1057,"There is no other city building game that even comes close to offering the creative freedom that Skylines does.  If you can envision it, you can build it!"
1058,"I have been playing this for over a year now consistently and I am still hooked. I looked for ages for a MTG replacement due to lack of players and opportunity. Eternal really scratches that itch and there is never a problem to find players. There is fresh stuff and organised play. So, all good."
1059,Great game to get lost in
1060,"With the exception of the expensive cost to add content, this game is actually great. It's a great replacement to Sim City. Some of the road placement can be a bit difficult at first, as is the terrain modifying tools. This game has entertained me for hours. I highly recommend it."
1061,"for weirdos like myself, this is addictive as hell"

1107,Best city builder around yes
1108,Very Fun.
1109,"We've waited a long time for this, but it's finally here: The perfect city building simulation. There really isn't much more to say about this. Those who grew up with Sim City will find what Sim City has always promised and suggested but never delivered. The DLC policy may be questionable, but it always adds a new exciting part.
For perfectionists, however, the game is a great challenge. If you don't just want to build cities in the pattern of street fans, you have to do a lot of meticulous work and you can't avoid mods. If you can live with the fact that the city doesn't look like a digital image of a real city, you'll be really happy here. Unfortunately, at some point I had to admit defeat and realize: I will never be able to build an organic city with my lay knowledge and without excessive use of mods. Unfortunately, that frustrated me so much that I was never able to ""complete"" the game."
1110,"I didn't know how to place firefight stations properly, then I fix it, days later my city drown and I panic, did-int know what to do and lost everything, amazing game, nice graphics, really cold sounds, really entertaining 10/10,"
1111,pog champ
1112,I don't have any hard-hitting analysis. This game fuckin rocks
1113,lota fun
1114,"This is the best city building game out there! It has very simple graphics without mods but personally I think the game is boring without assets. I have hundreds of them so i really cant live without out them, but you probably could."
1115,"I do like the game but there are many problems with the game crashing on steam, you have to delete the paradox launcher v2 app every time you restart the game or you will not be able to run it. Apparently it is a long time known issue that should be fixed already, otherwise the game itself is fun for strategists."
1116,best game in steam

1159,"If you too were disappointed by the dumpster fire that was Sim City, then playing Cities: Skylines will almost be therapeutic. This game is the one Electronic Arts should have created but didn't. Is it perfect? No, but it is ambitious and shows immense promise. Cities: Skylines should appeal to a wide range of players, both casual and hardcore. You can dive into the mechanics as deep as you wish! It's very easy to lose yourself in this game for many hours. There are heaps of expansion packs to enrich your experience. Of course there is also a vibrant modding community to provide Cities: Skylines players with free content.

Paradox Interactive is a bit infamous for their profit model. They usually release basegames with the promise of an almost indefinite stream of DLC's. The reason why I don't mind this usually is because most of their games are pretty niche and new titles are released very rarely. Without downloadable content the money stream would dry up quickly. I would also say that most of the Paradox DLC is very optional and not basegame material disguised as new content. This is mostly true for Cities: Skylines. That being said, I do think some content that is sold as DLC should be basegame material. To mention an example: The basegame has no seasons. Customers have to buy DLC for that. This DLC then fails to actually add the passing of seasons year around, but rather adds different 'weather' maps, such as snowy maps or sunny maps. This is cheap, in my opinion. 
I do think the basegame was a little bare-bones and was clearly assuming you would buy more expansion packs in the future. It felt like I was playing a demo to decide whether or not I'd purchase the DLC's. That is not how Paradox games usually are and I hope this will be better balanced in the sequal.

Despite all that, I think it is a game that's worth the money you throw at it. If this sort of thing is up your alley then the DLC will definitely be worth it for you. Some people just really like City Builders and this is the one most worthy of your time at the moment.

I have always known (and loved) Paradox Interactive for their more niche titles such as Crusader Kings and Hearts of Iron. But with Cities: Skylines they are finally bursting into the mainstream and giving EA a run for their money. It's cool to see developers that still deliver on promises are creating alternatives for franchises ruined by greed and corporatism."

1164,Insanely fun.
1165,I LOVE THIS GAME - i love watching all the silly little people in my silly little city going about their silly little errands on my silly little transit system. When I got covid I played this game for 3 days straight without sleeping and couldn't feel my body and my eyes burned. 10/10.

Paradox are immoral with their DLC practices. I won't support this practice; it's tantamount to having pay-to-win microtransactions. Vote with your wallet.

1183,"As someone who ""grew up"" in SimCIty 4 and its mechanics, getting into Cities: Skylines was difficult at first. Had to go through some growing pains in my first city, but after doing some research and trial-and-error, I eventually was able to get said city to stand on your own. Now deep into my second city & with some of the newest DLCs installed, I'm continuing to learn about new ways to set up and run things more smoothly. Once you get into the nitty-gritty of things, you'll find yourself addicted and thinking about what to do next in your city the next time you get to play the game. Very worth playing if this is your type of game."

1188,pollution go brrrrrrrrr
1189,"I've put a sizeable amount of time in this game now and all I can say is how bad I am compared to the city builder gods that I see online. The more you play this game, the more you get to know how things can be better and the more you understand that this game will take hundreds of hours of playing to understand it fully.
Good Luck if you are thinking of buying this."
1190,"A game that even with Vanilla with no DLC and MODS can be an enjoyable experience. However the option of various DLC's accompanied with the glorious steam workshop have really made this game a fine tuning experience for those who love building sims. Highly recommend to anyone who is looking for have a calm 
 and enjoyable experience...unless you bought the natural disasters DLC. Good luck and happy building!

1200,"this has got to be the worst game i have ever played that costs this much money and tries to be realistic. like this game tries to be realistic but just isn't even remotely close, not to mention that the maps themselves are terrible with the train tracks being so far away from where you start and the fact that it takes 11 days for a car to drive across a highway."

1206,"I can't wait for the next version of this game. However, DLC's are expensive and limited in benefits you could easily combine 2 or more for their prices. The game is also only worth playing due to the Workshop items. Finally, the engine needs drastic optimization and atleast options for users to limit items in order to not use up all your RAM and CPU power."

1264,Recommended!!
1265,i love this game
1266,"Fun, but definitely pick up some mods. Found the base game way too frustrating in terms of how car reliant the game's mechanics are, which made it difficult to create the sort of environment I recognise. The inability to create pedestrian-only shopping areas annoyed me a lot in particular, but the various traffic controlling mods combined with Building Spawn Points to be able to create back alleys for vans to unload or collect at stores with while only pedestrians can access the front side helped a lot."

1271,"This was one of the most enjoyable games I discovered in the past couple of years. The base game has enough content to keep you busy and learning; while the DLCs may seem pricey, the content is highly worth the cost if you enjoy the base game."
1272,all-time great game
1273,"I love how I can create a city, with plumbing, electric, etc. Easy controls and to understand. Very similar to SimCity, but better."
1274,good
1275,I have a problem with this game. i cant stop playing it
1276,Rename the game to Traffic Simulator and that's what this game is
1277,Actually the best city builder
1278,"you cant do shit without dlc
but the modding community carries this game so it cancels out"
1279,this game is alot of fun its even more fun when i use the infinite money cheat and the rest but playing legit is fun as well
1280,it is very creative and fun
1281,Very cool game. Its better with the Dlcs and Mods and The modded maps. Thanks for making a wonderful game!
1282,nice
1283,This game is super easy to just relax and build the city of your dreams
1284,it good
1285,"6/10, basic, for me i need mods to play and samilar to most who play"
1286,So goddamn nice in every way
1287,"Good Game, alot of stuff that piss me off but its still a fun game to play!
would be awesome if it could be also be an online game so that i could invite my mates to help me.
"
1288,.
1289,fun funny
1290,"nice
"
1291,love this game...although there are many add ons that can become expensive
1292,"I waited ten minutes for a level to load. The game then fails to give clear instructions and advice on how to build things. I played for five hours in total, hoping in vain for something more, but the truth is...it runs like crap and is almost impossible to play without looking up cheats on forums."
1293,Good.
1294,Abi çalıyo çırpıyo ama yapıyo bee
1295,very good game
1296,"love this game
"
1297,i play this when im feeling depressed it doesnt help but atleast i can drown civilisations in the ocean
1298,"my city burned down to the ground, the screams still haunt me to this day"
1299,"I Love It I Just Wish My Game Wouldn't Mess Up  When I Reach !00,000 People That Sucks but Other Then That I Love It!!"
1300,i have been playing this game since 2015. so thats all i have to say about it.
1301,Perhaps if the effort that was put into the $230 of DLC was put into the base game it wouldn't feel like playing a beta release. So much wasted potential.
1302,This game will waste away all of your time... but in a good way?
1303,it used to be free now no more
1304,"If you got a good graphics card, this game might be for you.
It's a modern SimCity-like game, however the amount of DLC may put you off.
It definitely put me off, but I feel like the base game is fine."
1305,Construction go burrr :3
1306,"Pay to build (the game price is decent but there's like $300 in DLCs to buy for the full game).
Also buggy as hell.
Don't buy the ""value"" pack or whatever they call it it just gives you a music track for $5."
1307,"Fuck this game so much. I hate it. I hate it. I hate it. I SPEND STRAIGHT 5 HOURS ON LITERALLY JUST BUILDING A FEW ROADS AND HIGHWAYS. Maybe something just wrong with me, but this game makes me go nuts. I keep playing it for the sake of learning how to do it better and better until I can say I am confident playing it. I'm glad something drives my brain so much though.."
1308,"You ever think to yourself 'I won't try crack, not even once.  I won't like it anyway', but then try it and like it?

Cities Skylines is meth"
1309,Its fun for people who like to build and design.
1310,"Don't get me wrong, this game is incredible.  I simply can't recommend it when the base version is so bare bones that you miss most of the experience.  226$ for the rest of the game.  This absolute garbage monetary system is far too anti-consumer to recommend this to anybody.  The game is so old.  Sell the full damn thing for 60$ guys.  I was an idiot and bought most of the dlc on Xbox, I wanted to play here on Steam but there's not a chance that I'm paying that amount again.  I tried to play the base game and it was boring af."
1311,The best traffic simulator that has ever been made.
1312,"I am trash at city building, but this game is so nice I don{t even care"
1313,"I recommend this game [i]conditionally[/i].

First off, it has a lot of great features and city management tools built into it.  The base game is pretty darn good and enjoyable for smaller cities.  It has tons of upgrades and a lot of things to keep you busy managing all of your major city based responsibilities.

However, once you start going larger than small cities, the glaring lack of certain features becomes extremely obvious.  For instance, Vanilla Industry is just terrible and traffic management without certain mass transportation options becomes, frankly, unmanageable.  For these reasons, I don't suggest just buying and playing Vanilla.  I highly suggest waiting  for a sale and buying Vanilla plus four DLC's that massively change how the game is played for the better.

Get these DLC's right away to make your life easier:  Industries, Mass Transit, Park Life, After Dark and Campus.

Now that being said, there are some Cons to the game that ended up being the reason I stopped playing it.  First off, whoever designed the base assets in this game threw in a really weird, eclectic mix of American, European and, especially, Asian style homes, businesses and industries.

If you zone a neighborhood, then you could have very starkly modern home go up right next to an American suburbia house.  In the retail district you could start off with a brick and mortar store, but when it upgrades to level four it suddenly becomes this weirdly Asian style building festooned with videos, neon and odd decorations.

In other words, cities in this game aren't very homogenized.  There's no cohesive feel to it, and in order to get that cohesive feel, you'll spend hours modding the game before you even put your first street down.

Also, there just aren't that many assets.  Especially for high rise buildings.  If you zone a large area with high rise residential and business, then you'll get dozens of the exact same, carbon copy buildings which just isn't how cities are actually built.

One last thing that really bothers me about this game is the lack of native parking support.  Not one parking garage asset is in the base game, and not one parking lot asset is in the base game.  Cars park alongside roads or nowhere at all and they vanish into and out of thin air constantly.

Parking management in a city is just as important as traffic management, so I'm oddly confused as to why you have to mod parking lots and garages into the game when they should really be vanilla assets."
1314,"no moar grids

also how tf does this 7 year old game bring my gaming laptop to its knees"
1315,"I have modded this game to the point where it is about as stable as a uranium so whenever I play the game either crashes at the loading screen or 15 minutes into gameplay.

Extremely fun game, love building my city even if it takes 30 minutes for me to get into my save."
1316,Amazing fun city builder. Tons of mod and dlc options for creativity to play with in your city. Wish performance was a tad better at larger cities but still an amazing game for anyone who likes similar genres.
1317,"just a fun city building sim
"
1318,"Easy to get lost in. So many intricate details and things to deep dive into, it will take you literal years to learn best methods - but like, years in the BEST way. Totally enjoyable gameplay."
1319,dlc expensive
1320,highway go BRRRRRRRR
1321,Better than Simcity. Highly recommend investing in the industries DLC for more income quicker.
1322,"Unintentionally making a 100,000k population slum with rolling blackouts and chronic money management problems 10/10 would recommend"
1323,"its amazing no dislikes
"
1324,it's good bruh
1325,very good my fav
1326,yes
1327,idk why i am reccomending this game its so frustrating your citizens will never be happy but my simulation idiot heart is happy
1328,Great city builder.
1329,b
1330,Perfect game for people who like a challenge and have creativity in city visions.
1331,This game is so easy to turn on and just get lost in it for hours on end. It is also a phenomenal way to relax once and a while.
1332,Nice game for creative minds
1333,Unlimited potential for creativity - very satisfying as a long term game
1334,One of the most interesting games to mimic real life imo thus far. I like how much ground this game covers with ability to manipulate population/design a city. The sky is the limit!
1335,"love it , best city builder out there. only complaint is that the roads always have traffic jams no matter what you do. its realistic in a way but also a bit too much imo. i wish the driving Ai would take other paths when the main road is full."
1336,"good game
"
1337,it is a great realistic cioty building game
1338,"Love the game, not just a worthy heir to the Sim City idea but something similar that is FAR better done. Playing it is truly fun and possible, without stupid glitches and with great game help. I love playing this and would advise anyone who loves urban planing to give it a shot."

1349,Excellent game
1350,"good
"
1351,Can you build cities? Yes. Can you destroy them? Yes. Sounds good to me.
1352,good game
1353,i get to live out my childhood dreams of being a civil engineer and also the innate human dream of flooding an entire city. brilliant.
1354,Its a great Game but if you download more then 15 16 mods the game crashes
1355,"i lose track of time when i play this game.
is that a good thing or not?
The answer shall never be revealed."
1356,32 hours over 2 days and I have yet to create a remotely screenshot worthy city. Amazing.
1357,"3/5 addictive gameplay, but in need of so much renovation with mods and DLC's that it can be too much of a hassle to see what it really has to offer."
1358,"This is the best city building game made, if would still work!!! Used to be fine but lately its been supper slow and it will no longer launch! I've had this game for 2 years now and i've never had problems like this!"
1359,It's like if you knew Sim City back in school and you meet her again at the coffee shop and she grew up to be just smokin' hot and super fun to hang out with.
1360,e
1361,"Very addictive game, some mechanics need to be updated but i play this almost every day."
1362,my mods dont work :( any reason why?

1372,traffic stress simulator
1373,Hi
1374,"I wish I bought this game 10 years ago instead of Sim City 4.

If you like city builders like Sim City, this is the best next game to play and probably better than Sim City. The game is well balanced, and looks better than SC4. The UI is much better IMO. It was difficult at first for me to get off the ground but after reading a few city building basics tutorials for this game I was finally able to get a city started :)

There are other city builders that look good on Steam, but I am going to play C:S for a while, it is still very new to me even though the game itself is 10+ years old!

I run a Ryzen 9 5950x w/ 64GB ram, RTX 3070, 2 TB SSD, 10+ TB HDD disk space. I can load over 200 GB of assets - so much I hit the 15K workshop sub limit before hitting my hardware limit. I am currently working on finding mods and fixing / deleting assets that are errored/missing/failed/etc.

I will definitely make a collection later to save others time as it's taken me days on end just configuring the game and sorting mods/assets out.

Highly reccommended even in 2022

NOTE TO VALVE/STEAM: You have optimized FPS games like HL2, CS:GO, GTA5, all which use a mouse for input that would be difficult to implement... But Cities: Skylines likely being the easiest has been left for last? All it takes is converting the mouse to touch for clicks and then drag for moving map. Please optimize Cities: Skylines for remote play, it is almost naturally a mobile game."

1377,"This is a fantastic game,the base game is a bit plain but what i love is the fact that the game lets the community shape the gameplay.My favourite game overall ever!"

1380,Best city game ever
1381,good game
1382,Yes
1383,The base game is great but adding dlc’s and mods makes it even better.
1384,"If only we had this game but we could also make entire countries.

Its great, takes a while to learn how to actually educate your citizens, but you'll get it eventually.

Paradox makes the best games."
1385,"if you have a life, now you dont, enjoy the game, its fun."
1386,its making city skylines.
1387,Great Game!
1388,play game good game
1389,veri gud
1390,I am an engineer and it's fun to use my experince to play
1391,My wife and children left me
1392,It's the best pure city building simulator out there if you ask me. Yes traffic is still a random issue but if you know or learn some real world traffic logic it will help as well.
1393,"Heal myself, cities and cities...."
1394,"I is very good, while traffic is a nightmare!"
1395,why wont they stop dying
1396,"This is my favorite game of all time. It is so incredible and spectacular that gives me such a good experience. Great thanks to all the workshop contributors, they give this game indisputable varieties. City skyline is the first game ever I am truly engaged. 
我不知道怎么形容我对这款游戏的喜爱。作为第一次玩PC game的玩家， 因为CITYSKYLINE 我第一次接触了装机， 只为了我的市民能在一个更流畅更美好的城市生活。 问朋友有什么顶级配置的时候， 他们都很惊讶我只是为了CitySkyline。但是对于我来说， 这个游戏是最值得我投入金钱和时间去提高游戏体验的。"
1397,Fucking hell
1398,It's a very good game all around.
1399,I like almost everything about the game except the fact that it doesn't auto save your progress. That was a pain in the butt.

"
1401,Ich bin ein Bürgermeister :)
1402,"Nice building game. Vanilla stuff gets a little boring with time though, so I'm glad that it can be modded."
1403,very good
1404,"Very good, very nice!"
1405,"I COULD PLAY THIS GAME FOR HOURS
"
1406,"Haven't played it much really, but its pretty good I think."
1407,Great fun with a general principal from Sim City but just advanced by about 50 years.
1408,"I built perfect city and then it was bombed and ruined by russsians
What do I do wrong?"
1409,"Despite being completely car-centric and requiring roads everywhere, this is a great game. Perhaps an update or v2 will fix the issue - i.e. if you want to pace a train station it must be connected to a road. Not good if you want to create a pedestrian utopia :)"
1410,"REGARDLESS OF GAME CATEGORIES, ONE OF THE BEST."
1411,Have blimps educate your city filled with middle school dropouts
1412,.
1413,"The content is split in too many expensive DLCs

Good game otherwise!"
1414,The game is great if you do it correctly. For the game to reach it’s full potential you need DLC and Mods to inhance your game. But you can play without it.
1415,nice
1416,its great getting lost in design ideas and options. Get basic mods like Move it to make Vanilla game better
1417,"Good game but what the fuck is their privacy policy
For those who don't read it (understandable), they collect EVERYTHING and sell it to third-parties :|"
1418,Best city building game out there!
1419,"Great game. I wish there were true day/night and weekend cycles, and work schedules. For most players, the traffic management is by far the funnest aspect, and yet it's not very complex overall, from what I've read. It would be great to have weekends with most of the city off of work and exploring parks and attractions with their families - it would be a nice vibe. Also, weather is boring and they didn't implement the Snowfall DLC with the main game very well. Still a lot of fun to be had, but it's missing some ""simulation"" that would be really cool to play with."
1420,"Game is so good that I created a new account and bought twice! Highly recommended, tbh."
1421,BREATHE AIR!
1422,"Don't think of this game like it's *just* a simulation or management game, because based on my understanding it's not the best at being either of those things and frustrating for perfectionists who expect an experience like Factorio. Think of this game as a Bonsai Tree, a zen-like experience where you watch you guide your city in is growth and trim away what doesn't fit, incorporating the wabi-sabi quality as it expands according to the geometry of the space and the location of its resources."
1423,very good to mod and addictive.
1424,"It's as addictive as simcity3000, or whatever the last good one was."
1425,you know the game is good when you can dump sewage onto civilians houses
1426,Great game
1427,its fun
1428,"Prepare to give up days of your life to this game, for better or worse."
1429,it is very fun if you like to engeneer citys
1430,"Cities Skylines is a good step forward from SimCity, with both approachable challenges and intricate gameplay, although the graphics are not as impressive as what Maxis provides in their version of the city builder."
1431,Way too many bugs in this game.
1432,Very fun and realistic!
1433,DLC Has Ben Pending For 10 Minutes But The DLC Was Good It was the Disater One
1434,Crashes
1435,Fixing traffic simulator
1436,Best city builder I've ever played
1437,"For the past month, xQc got me hyped to play C:S, I really want more Mayor X content juice so bad man
xqcJuice JuiceTime

I was surprised hearing Faster Than Light on Cities radio, made me wanna play Stellaris once again, also makes me imagine a tyrant dictator who has conquered the whole galaxy, gets bored and decides to retire to a far border continental planet, truly working as a mayor of a city for the well-being of the primitive species living there."
1438,literally spent countless hours mindlessly building a city and fixing traffic
1439,"jp k
"
1440,One of the best city building games I have ever encountered.  And it just keeps getting better.
1441,"It's an immersive game but there are many things I wish I had known when I started with 0 hours. The experience is largely incomplete without DLCs and mods - see the list at the end of this review.

As with many games, you learn by trial and error plus some research. You might have to start completely over as you grow in your role of a city builder and realize your past mistakes. 

During my first 100 hours or so I scrapped a few cities. After each of them, there was a long break of not playing but eventually I always returned. Now, at the time of writing this, I have built my biggest city ever and still have a lot to achieve. This time, though, I'm confident that this city is worth sticking with until the end as all the major big-picture mistakes were done in my previous saves.

This game gives you that ""one more thing before I quit"" feeling quite regularly. You can always make your city better, whether it's practical optimizing or aesthetic details you're willing to work on. A big chuck of the former revolves around traffic and logistics. 

DLCs I've chosen:
- Mass Transit
- After Dark
- Campus
- Industries
- Sunset Harbor
You can get all of these for a low price by buying activation keys. I'd recommend getting them pretty soon but they're not a must for getting the feel for the game. 

More importantly, I couldn't live without these mods:
- Traffic Manager: President Edition
- Precision Engineering
- Network Extensions 2
- Harmony
- Chirpy Exterminator (optional)
I want to emphasize that these simply let you do things you'd expect to be able to do in vanilla but you can't. Please, do yourself a favor, and install them right off the bat."
1442,fantastic game and the mods and DLC are great. Please add the ability to do mixed used housing!
1443,yeeeee
1444,good.
1445,Better than SimCity.
1446,"Best game ever. So deep and so fun, with so many different elements to explore. Highly recommended."
1447,"Great city builder. I used to play SimCity 2000 a lot, this works well as a modern replacement, in my opinion."
1448,"all time favorite. can't stop, won't stop playing"
1449,Absolute banger. NOT JUST BIKES
1450,Made a Weeb City
1451,Fun
1452,"a
"
1453,A bit of a challenge but pretty good.
1454,for ppl like me that just want to play god is amazing.
1455,Fun game
1456,"After far too many hours using vanilla and mods, this game is gold. Thanks devs!"
1457,"This game was fun at first. You can play normally or get some mods and just build away and experiment with the industries and what not. Now, for some reason, the industries are not working right. I've reinstalled the game twice and the problem persists. This is just using the built in mods by the way."
1458,"I bought this game, initially on a Mac.

Yeah, don't do that.

I've finally been able to play it on a PC and I really recommend it. The graphics are beautiful.

Although the basic premise of a City builder is to go from nothing to a sprawling metropolis, the pacing of the milestones is forgiving enough that if you muck up your finances early, you can still recover enough to muck them up continually throughout the game.

There is the option for unlimited funds, and to unlock the milestones, but honestly, that can take the fun out of it sometimes."
1459,Incredible every you want in a city builder but there is a bit much DLC
1460,Shockingly good
1461,cool

1463,
1464,"A interesting game to play that explores sandbox ideas, money management, and expansion. Great challenge and great fun to play, especially with the mods. Only the DLCs are mixed for me because some are amazing and worth it meanwhile some are just cash grabs."
1465,gud
1466,0ij
1467,one of best city building games out there. i find my self going back to this game all the time.
1468,good
1469,grea
1470,Best city building game.
1471,Lots of mods and fun. Have a good one!
1472,Its a fun relaxing city planner/builder
1473,"$230 to get all the content for this game. That's excluding base game.

Keep this Sims level shit out of strategy and simulation games."
1474,good
1475,"A little like collecting Funko Pops. Theres lots of variation, it all looks pretty neat, but ultimately there's not enough going on here to both participate, and feel like ones money, time, and intelligence is being spent anywhere near wisely enough. 

Do not play the console version/collect Funko Pops."
1476,Yes
1477,Still a noob but I'm finding this much better than SimCity. Can't wait to try the mods.
1478,epiko
1479,The gold standard for city building games. Decent graphics and tons of terrain forming tools. You can make any type of city you want. Would highly recommend this to others.
1480,"enjoyable relaxing, like making a pet?
"
1481,I like the destruction
1482,"This game is great for people who like to micro manage and design stuff at the same time. 
Also, no matter how you build your city, it'll look good at night."
1483,So many mods!
1484,fun  very creative
1485,al fin Bogotá tiene metro :D
1486,Pretty neat
1487,"I really like the city building experience, how you can really make the city how you want it. At first i was not really great at it but after a couple plays and knowing the things you unlock you can prepare better for the future of your city"
1488,"Great game, but how on earth am I supposed to fix unemployment rates when I keep on building new residents and schools lol"
1489,fun
1490,A great way to spend a lot of hours
1491,yes ;)
1492,fun gamr
1493,fortnite season 2 battlepass
1494,Great city builder born of the Sim City 2013 screw up
1495,"Ive played this game on PS4 for over a year but did not like that ps4 dont have mods so I had to get it for pc and I will say playing on pc is way better than the ps4 version, better graphics and the ability to have mods is a double win. This is a fantastic sim building game and highly recommend it if you like building things love this game."
1496,great game
1497,Changes how you see your city irl
1498,"I want to like it but I don't. 
Fuck this game"
1499,Very creative Love this game
1500,yes
1501,"it is very fun
"
1502,"What a beautiful game this is. I played this game a lot on the console editions and finally picked it up here. DLCs make this game a lot more enjoyable, so I'd recommend buying this when there's a DLC edition that's on a good sale. This game is a very chill and soothing city-building simulator and it's one of the best out there!"
1503,"Yeah, city building."
1504,Better than SimCity.
1505,"I need friends badly so I built a city but still no friends, but I am not sure if the city will succeed, great game haven't played much but the little I have the city building Sim is great"
1506,unending creativity
1507,so incredibly addictive

1510,What do you want in your city but don't currently have?
1511,"I like City Builder games. If you like city builder games too then you will like this game for sure. It has all the things to build a city. Including but not limited to, roads, houses, and even commercial and industrial zones. Its got it all. If i wanted to build a city in real life. I would just use this game and say, ok ya do that, and there would probably be no problems. So if you want to build a city then get this game and build one."
1512,one of my favorites
1513,Its a great city planning game
1514,697 savegames without any continuation yet very enjoying gameplay :)
1515,"This game scratches an itch in my brain,

Amazing community of modders and asset creators, and DLC coming outta the wazoo.
I'm a bit sad the base game alone is a little bare, but there's lots of bundles and offers on DLCs,
And if you don't feel like paying, steam workshop pretty much has you covered in terms of custom buildings, 
services, decals, props, etc. Loads of letsplays and tutorials are on Youtube and in general the community around it is quite nice!

About 1000 hours in and very much enjoying playing."
1516,Great game!

1518,not enough educated workers?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!

1524,"Much cities, much traffic, much fun"
1525,city

1551,very fun
1552,"So fun when it works, Sometimes I need to reset my computers. But still love it."
1553,"As someone who loves building city, this is probably the best city building game you can get."
1554,.
1555,"I love C:S. I just bought this game like 2 weeks ago and already have 8+ hours of it streamed and over 170 hrs played, there are so many things you literally can do whether that be make poo mountain/Architect Hill (inside joke) or create the most sophisticated cities in the world along with thousands of useful mods packs, maps packs, building packs, vehicle packs, plant packs. I can go on and on and on about how much i love it but you wont know EXACTLY how much until you play it and for only being 30 USD, i would consider it practically a wise investment of your free time/money"
1556,great game for happiness
1557,"Well designed and thought out. While some arbitrary aspects of the game are frustrating (unlocks at certain population levels, the proportions of some facilities), they're easily overshadowed by the intuitive tools, beautiful aesthetics, amazing mod contributions, smooth and reliable software, and the overall technical achievement of this simulator."
1558,GOOD
1559,"Amazing city builder! you can play super detailed, or more laid back. Highly reccomend"
1560,\a
1561,I like it. It's a bit challenging at first but when you get the hang of it it's really fun. Still not as good as among us though.
1562,Black hole micro management. Good times.
1563,"actually satisfying to play when things go well and really rewarding, although when shit hits the fan and the city isnt profiting, it gets fustrating as well as hitting a large population and having to deal with traffic"
1564,fun classic
1565,
1566,"The game won't launch. Tried to play 19/07/22 , hasn't launched since. It's been just over 3 weeks. I've tried all the various online tips, re installing, nothing. 

Steam shows the game as ""running"" but the launcher doesn't start. All I have is my own desktop and the rest of the computer working as usual. Its as if I didn't press the app icon."
1567,"helpful simulator for my work as a teacher.
Thx"
1568,IT'S VERY ENTERTAINING! ^v^
1569,"much wow, no time for life now."
1570,"Just remember if you have traffic, just add roundabout."
1571,Top SIM!
1572,it is very detailed
1573,.
1574,This is an awesome game with the passes and without!!
1575,10/10
1576,its a fun game tbh
1577,Very fun i like making cities but i dont like how there is so much locked behind dlcs
1578,"Vanilla game is good. The expansions make it better. But play with mods and workshop assets and its an incredible game. I've done everything from recreate the region I live in, to create all new ones to the finest level of detail. Definitely recommend this game to anyone interested in model train sets, city builders and anyone in the city planning or city management field."
1579,Best game when playing high.
1580,its gud
1581,"Honestly, one of the only titles in my library that keeps me coming back for more. The vanilla game alone is great, especially for just getting into it. The mod community is amazing, and the fact that the team behind the game is seemingly in full support of it is wonderful. At least it seems like they are anyway, since there have been a number of ""creator packs"" featuring models from players etc. For the longest time, my reason for not playing was some graphical issues on my side. However, the mod community helped out with that a lot, and things run great now on both my windows and apple silicon based machines. A game with versatility, broad compatibility, and can easily run on a variety of hardware, Cities is quite possibly the best game to scratch your citybuilding game itch."
1582,"One of my absolute favourite games of all time. I would recommend it ten times over if it was possible.
I played it intensly when it came out and now I come back to it whenever I need a break from regular gaming and I will probably come back for the rest of my life (or at least until Cities Skylines 2 (hopefully) releases)

This game is fun, it's relaxation, it's meditation and it's absolutely beautiful.
(even more so with the wonderful community of modders)

Even if you're not actively playing the game it's still fun just click follow on a car or pedestrian to watch where they're heading while leaning back in the gaming chair. 

I do have a few negatives though...

The DLCs are many but few brings worthy stuff to the game (some do don't read me wrong here) and the price-tag is kinda steep if u want all of them. Should all of them have brought moneys worth then sure I wouldn't mind the cost but it feels like most of these things should already have been in the base game.

Also... there's no multiplayer. I know most citybuilders don't have multiplayer so why should I complain on CS right? Well... building cities with friends is way more fun than building on your own... playing games in general is usually more fun with friends. I know CSM was working flawless up until... uhm I dunno a couple of months, 6 months, a year ago? (my memory is severely damaged after 10 concussions so don't hate on me for not remembering when it was). Now it's not working at all and I don't think it's because of modders but rather has something to do with the game but what do I know... I'm just a casual gamer. Anyways MP should be in a game like this from the start. If the developers don't know how then just hire the guys (guy?) behind CSM and for the love of GOD implement it in Cities Skylines 2 (if there will ever be a sequel)."
1583,asdasd
1584,I love this game but it seems every city I build it fails a few weeks in. Good game 10/10
1585,good game
1586,"Since im not a city architect and such, i suck at this game :D I can get a city going and growing, but it will look crappy and not like how a real city would ever be built. workshop content is mind blowing. If you want a city building game, buy this game, its all youll ever need..... until they make a sequel XD"
1587,It was tough for me to figure out the order in which items need to be created. The text is super small. It's kind of boring so far.
1588,Great city building game
1589,h
1590,If you're running short of crack cocaine just boot this game up.
1591,.
1592,Very good
1593,really detailed impressive and overall good game
1594,wanna played a game that has complexity & detail in city landscaping? or just want to enjoying the city vibe? Go get it
1595,best feeling in the world is when you spend two hours creating the perfect city and then drop 500 meteors right ontop of it.
1596,"Remember kids, if your citizens start complaining about taxes being high, you can always bulldoze their homes!"
1597,this game has an obnoxious privacy statement at the beginning that blocks you from playing unless you click into Steam and read all 40 pages of it. I'm sure we're all reading that.
1598,Gooddy
1599,simcity but slightly more realistic
1600,"I am late to the party, but I love this game. So relaxing. No online requirement, no microtransactions, just pure enjoyment."
1601,best game ever
1602,The Best!
1603,Nope
1604,The tools given to help you plan your city layout are useless. Without mods the game is more frustrating than enjoyable
1605,the best city builder i have ever played. Mods/Assets make the game on PC.
1606,yes
1607,good
1608,yeet
1609,build
1610,gud
1611,"Fun Game, wish it was more in depth"
1612,I love the freedom I have with this game
1613,"Nice evolution of SimCity 4. It'll be fun to see continued mod growth add more  options. Only real negative critique is regarding the ""Chirper"". Get rid of the damn thing. It is just an annoyance. (Just change it to a hide-able/movable menu like the old game.) Otherwise, nothing but good things. Thanks."
1614,"If you get the essential mods (Traffic President, etc. if i recall correctly) this still is the best city sim.

100% recommend"
1615,This game is my addiction. I love this game and everything about it. Even the bugs! The game is aging and it's starting to show when put against newer modern city games. I have put thousands of hours in gameplay with all the major DLC and can't wait to see what's next!
1616,great
1617,Think it's allright
1618,great game for an adderall prescription
1619,Good ole fun
1620,"Best game ever.Great graphics, dont getting borred. You always having something to add,fix,replace."
1621,awesomeness
1622,s
1623,this is a great and realistic game
1624,"my bad pc caught fire after finally loading into a modded game after 30 minutes, would recommend"
1625,"You can make cities bigger than dubai, or make the worst city ever and do whatever you want"
1626,great game
1627,I'm doomed to watch expert players on YouTube and fail to recreate their skills in my game.  But I can't stop trying. Practice makes perfect.
1628,ben
1629,"If you like SimCity - you will absolutely LOVE Cities:Skylines. You can customise nearly everything to make your perfect city and the Steam website also provides loads of cool mods to add more. Like other games, there are expansion packs to add more to the game - I would really recommend getting them. However, even if you can only afford the base game, there is so much to do."
1630,Endless building opportunities. Some bugs needs fixing. Needs more help tools in object functions in the game.
1631,
1632,my city is currently horrendous but this is a good game nonetheless
1633,This Game is amazing. It can help people learning city designers for it's hyper realistics.
1634,Real sick m8
1635,This game is very fun and i recommend it if you like building games.
1636,keren
1637,"why are the dlcs so expensive its honestly heartbreaking

but besides that its a 9/10 sandbox. graphics aint revolutionary but their fine."
1638,"I mean the base game is not all that fun, but modded, holyyyyyyyyy, this game you can make cities you wish were in movies, you can make absolutely awesome things, 9/10 would recommend."
1639,nice
1640,Fixing traffic problems is my ASMR
1641,I recommend the game
1642,Favorite game
1643,I love this game! It is great and super fun to play.
1644,"buy it, and buy disasters dlc"
1645,Wonderful Game!
1646,this game really sharpens my brain and i've been playing this for years
1647,fun
1648,The best citybuilding game out there by far thanks to the mods and assets. I hope they incorporate some of them in the game.
1649,its only good if you have patience for games like this
1650,I loved this game and had a world of which I worked on for a month. But all of the sudden the game reboots and I lost all my progress in this world. If you care about keeping worlds don't download this game.
1651,"SHow
"
1652,THIS GAME SUCKS
1653,"Cities: Skylines comes highly recommended to any players to long for a city builder akin to the old days, with the joys of more modern gaming. 

Skylines has a very deep and advanced AI management system in place for traffic, crime, and countless other categories. Additionally the community has seen to near-endless workshop content to fill any persons desires in game. 

Skylines can be very challenging, and for some players looking for a more simplistic time in game, this may not be for you. This game requires a significant investment into learning the game mechanics due to its steep learning curve. Progression is natural, but will come eventually.

I would recommend this game 10/10 on sale for anyone, and when not on sale 8/10 for any city builder players."
1654,very fun if you love city building games this is the one for you
1655,good
1656,Great Game
1657,"god
d"
1658,spawned asteroid and wiped UK from existence. 10/10
1659,Love this game. My only issue is that my achievements don't work right.
1660,great for stepping away from all the noise.
1661,good game n whatever
1662,"it is a great game but know, at the start you lose a lot of money. And I mean a lot of money. But if you wait for long enough, you will slowly start earning money and scurrying out of dept in money. Go big early and succeed hugely later on. Remember to keep water, sewage, electricity and garbage service. The harder services to concentrate and notice getting bad are health, freaking EDUCATION who knew freaking education would be so hard I mean in real-life some people live very far from their school and still stay at that school, pollution and to me it seems like it is impossible to make a city without pollution unless you ignore the industry demand.Please, don't follow this as a tutorial, this is just my opinion about the game and MY OPINION MATTERS THE MOST BECAUSE, because I dont know but MOPINION IS FRAKING RIGHT! IF YOUR NAME IS JOHN GO START A YOUTUBE CHANNEL AND WHEN YOURE FAMOUS TELL ME THAT ITS YOU AND ILL KNOW THAT I CAN CONVINCE PEOPLE THEIR GREAT! FINALLY! But seriously dont doubt yourself you can do anything great if you set your mind to it and dont overlook others because they're starters and be helpful and not so full of yourself."
1663,very fun
1664,good city building game too adicting
1665,"Super fun game, mods add a lot of longevity to it as well. Make sure to check them out."
1666,good
1667,"This has got to be the best city builder out there. Do I really need to say anything more? 

The hardware requirements of the base game, even with all DLCs, are okay, but once you start downloading mods and assets (which, believe me, you [b] will [/b]), the game starts to take up a lot of memory. So much so, that 16GB is not enough. The game has slight performance issues, especially if you have mods that alter the cims AI and such. It is not that your computer is weak, it's the limitation of the game engine. But don't be affraid, it runs pretty good without mods. 

There are some slight bugs, again, most of them related to mods, but some are in the base game. Some can be annoying, especially some AI pathfinding bugs, but most of them you won't notice until you start looking for them. 

The game can get [b] very expensive[/b], considering how many DLCs there are and the price of them. I would suggest waiting for a big sale and buying the whole package. I was able to buy this game, with all the DLCs (except Airports) for 19€ on Humble Bundle (that's less than the base game!). 

Overall, I can recommend this game to anyone who likes city builders, and even people who want to look into the genre and are looking for a starter game. 10/10

1668,"its a fun game
"
1669,"Great city builder game. Lots of community mods for maps and assets as well as complete game changing mods. I recommend to anyone who has a like for the city builders
"
1670,good game but it doesn't work well for laptops
1671,nice
1672,"It is very good game
"
1673,GOOD GOOD GOOD
1674,Bought a new PC just to play this game!! Loving every single second of playing it..
1675,Best city sim in the market.
1676,"Arguably the BEST city builder out there with in-depth customisation of your own city down to a fine-level. The experience becomes even better when mods are mixed in from the Steam Workshop - akin to opening your third eye or some sh*t. I previously played using the Xbox App on PC but found most features from this version to be lacking so I bought the steam version and I can say it was not a mistake. For newbies who have no idea how things work or what things do - you'll learn. Alternatively, you can watch Let's Players such as City Planner Plays or Biffa Plays Indie Games to gain some inspiration about what you can build. The DLC, while somewhat unreasonably priced for what you get, does significantly add to your experience, for example Parks and Recreation allows you to make finely-tuned city parks and plazas. Do your own research on which ones you might want to buy. If you liked SimCity, you'll wanna marry Cities' Skylines."
1677,good game
1678,good game well played
1679,"I cannot create my dream city how I envisioned it to be. Instead, I have to manage a chaotic city with endless traffic problems. Still fine with it though. Must play!"
1680,"Massive data collection. Game asks you to sign like 5 different agreements. There's no way any of that is good for users. Stay away from this company, game, and others that leech of unsuspecting victims. They bet on people who purchased their product to be too lazy to read. This nonsense has to stop. The game is ok, but not worth it. Boycott these companies or they will never stop until it hits their wallets."
1681,"its fun, but too confusing for my small head"
1682,Good
1683,THE  BEST.
1684,"Great game. With the right mods and DLCs its the best city builder out there.
Be sure to check out some Youtubers like City Planner Plays for  a good overview of the game"

1701,A game where I be shenanery and amazed and hate myself
1702,very good very nice
1703,Nice game!
1704,Not perfect tho
1705,"Pretty dang fun, get's SUPER engaging once you start adding mods!"
1706,Great game to get sucked into. The reason simcity doesnt exist anymore.
1707,
1708,"i made the worst godforsaken city known to fucking man and watched it all collapse within minutes 


10/10"
1709,The modding community is the best thing to ever happen in this game!
1710,خعهعةع
1711,city go brr
1712,It's hard at first but it's fun later
1713,gud game
1714,"This is Paradox at their finest. Complex, granular controls and total freedom combined with robust modding support, this is the pinnacle of city building games."
1715,Great game. Bought in 2017 and only now started to play and cant stop
1716,FUN! love the cheat modes. Playing vanilla and because of those I am a happy camper.
1717,FUN
1718,"an overall great game. Even though my computer should't be able to run this at all, im glad it does!"
1719,"The best city builder out there, period.  It has a few annoyances, but the extensive and active modding community is excellent and really lets you extend and correct functions of the game.  Also, the workshop buildings are incredible, and there's tens of thousands!"
1720,wow
1721,This game keeps on crashing every time I try to open it. It  is not my computer's fault because all of the other games I have installed work perfectly fine.
1722,"Honestly my favorite game. With mods it seems like you can really do whatever you put your mind to, and the base game still offers a ton too. Can I give it a 100/10?"
1723,Yes i recommend this game but only if you are willing to accept the frustration of modding.
1724,city

1733,"really the only option for a standard somewhat realistic city builder, it definitely has its fair share of odd design, and the dlcs can be a bit greedy, but solid overall"

1735,"Great game, a lot of cities to choose from.  The expansions are decent, I would watch a couple of videos on youtube on which expansions you need/want.
"
1736,"incredibly chill and fun game, tons of replay value before even mentioning the minecraft-worthy amount of mods.
Lose yourself in making a single garden in a house, or a massive university campus, then throw a meteor at it! (after saving of course)
This game will make you want more than 32GB RAM once you get lost in mods though, be warned."
1737,hello
1738,Have you ever built a metro system then tried to set up the lines but the stops wouldn't connect so you rebuilt the tracks but the stops still wouldn't connect so you checked every segment of track to make sure everything was connected and everything looked fine but it still wouldn't work so you tried rebuilding the stations but it still wouldn't work so you rebuilt the tracks again but it still didn't work so you rebuilt the stations again and it worked?
1739,"nice games, tho with low specs its kinda annoying (low fps)
"
1740,my city got so big to the point where when i load it the game crashs
1741,"A great game for killing time and perfecting you inner Dictator
"
1742,"7 years have passed since the game came out, there is still no opponent to challenge it's throne. best of its kind."
1743,"A great Sim City game that has awesome visuals and awesome gameplay! You can create and destroy the city you just created  and I loved that part of the game!
https://youtu.be/Ok-M-wHtO7Q"
1744,"good
"
1745,good
1746,very fun building game
1747,I like the part where you build the city.
1748,Best building game ever!
1749,its cool
1750,i recreated north korea...it was fun
1751,An excellent game in which I can live out my dream of having functioning infrastructure
1752,fun
1753,"fun city
"
1754,"The only thing I like to do is this game is just do massive genocide to all the civilins, or just fill a massive volcano of shit and piss and then just put a hole in it and then see the whole city die to tsunami of shit and piss."
1755,"Very good
"
1756,its so realistic
1757,It's okay
1758,"I've been playing this game on and off for years and I LOVE it. I originally played it on the Xbox and I am happy to play it on the PC with all the MODs, DLC, etc. Its a good ""go to"" game when there is nothing else to play. With the game drought over the past 2 years, I keep coming back to it.

Must have if you are a Sim City, Roller Coaster Tycoon, Planet Coaster, etc. person like I am!"
1759,Collector good :) Stroad bad >:(
1760,good. yes
1761,"I love this game, I spent over 100 hours on Steam and over 400 hours on Xbox and other steam accounts. I spent around 200 dollars on the game from Pc to Xbox. Or sucks to see that the games developers are now like EA where they only care about money. Really, more than 10 DLC’S?!? You need that many? The developers care so much about money that over the years the frame rate and effort they put in to the game have gone down. It’s sad because this was my favorite game of all time, and the owners don’t care about their community unlike other games. It’s the same thing for the game prison Architect, owned by them. Again, 10+ DLC’s. That cost over 200 dollars with mixed reviews because even the DLC’s are broken. It’s sad that most gaming communities are now like this.

I recommend the regular edition of Cities Skylines. Nothing else. The DLC’s are not worth the price, besides maybe mass transit.

Don’t give the developers more money than they should deserve. Sorry."
1762,Fun game but way better with mods. Some basic mods should just be standard in the game. Too many DLCs to buy.
1763,dope
1764,the electrical grid man
1765,"Love this game! After many continuous failed relationships, my city has always been there waiting for me to come back, it's like.. destiny. Thank you Paradox <3"
1766,This game is very hard. I am not good with funding. It is also fun though. especially with an infinite money mod and the other mods
1767,"Broken! At a certain pop level, garbage trucks won't spawn no matter how many buildings there are and how high the garbage budget. Buildings burn down directly beside fire stations because those trucks won't spawn either. These were the same problems that plagued me last time I quit this game (in 2018) and they're still issues today. Otherwise ... this game is so intensely satisfying that it totally ruins my life, my sleep, my marriage and my business every time I reinstall it. If I really care about myself ... I won't play this game ever again. :)"
1768,"Very fun and entertaining,
it seems worth the price but you do get board with out addons
still greate would recommend"
1769,best city building game
1770,this game is amazing especially modded
1771,"Super nice game, although it really needs mods, without 'm it would be lamer. Very versatile and fun!  And about the DLC's, almost half of them are music DLC's so watch closely!"
1772,Super realistic and a great communirty!
1773,its gucci
1774,fun
1775,I'll be booked for the next 5 years
1776,this game turned my skin black
1777,"fun
"
1778,it is a challenging fun game
1779,"I have been playing city building games since the original simcity. This is by far my favorite. I initially started playing the vanilla game on my xbox a few years back, then got a gaming laptop with a good graphic card. This game is much better with the steam subscriptions. My only problem is I start building a city, get a few hours into my city, then get bored and start a new city. 10/10"
1780,y
1781,its super fun
1782,Fun strategy simulation game
1783,awesome game
1784,"A stunning, simple yet complex and deep city building game. Would recommend this game to anyone who enjoys any form of city building, resource management and 'flow' (traffic management being an extremely important part of the game) strategy games. One of my personal fave's in the library."
1785,nisha nei
1786,"i dislike the number of tiles each player can unlock
i like the vortex mod launcher and neuxes mods
i dislike the elevation update
i dont know how to make metro/subway tunnels[ if someone that can help me is out there please help me]
pg up and pg dn is not working
"
1787,Great Game!
1788,Great game!
1789,Amazing Game If you like City sims.
1790,It is nice and good very good and superb and awesome and stupendous and wow and cool and noice.
1791,can keep you entertained for hours
1792,love this game when im high
1793,Soy many options. It just sucks you in and you don't even realize it.
1794,Lots of fun and a great way to spend time relaxing!
1795,"Screw you. I came here thinking DLC might be <$5. No... What you thought would get you 3, only get you win. To get the entire thing costs $200+. Just no. This game is from 2015 and here are some other games I'd rather pay for before spending such a ludicrous amount on old city builder DLC. Red Dead 2, Cyber Punk, Crusader Kings 3, Elden Ring. Theres also 300+ games in my library that could have DLC, why would I pick City Skylines to be something lay cash down on? Spontaneous impulse buy. I'm not spending $15 a DLC. The amount of DLC I was thinking I would get would come out to $45..... If your response is wait for a Steam Sale then why? Refer to my earlier statement, there are major games and plenty of games that are higher priority than City Skylines. I wouldnt even be thinking about City Skylines.... If you can be satisfied with the base game that is the cost of two DLC then go ahead, it is pretty great. After that no, no absolutely not."
1796,its lovely
1797,i like this game it is very fun i get to live out my dreams of building a city with a well funded and intelligently constructed public transit system
1798,cities i love you baby
1799,Truly fun sandboxy game.
1800,its a good game
1801,Great game. So many cool ways to make your city
1802,"Great game, great DLC's full of content, and hundreds of workshop items to keep you busy for hours"
1803,ga
1804,It's good
1805,fun game. maybe a little too much micro-management.
1806,sux

1813,"roads , roads , and some more roads ."
1814,VERY ADDICTIVE AND ENTERTAINING.
1815,"traffic and poooooop
poop traffic, if you will"
1816,this game deleted my hair. :sob:
1817,i like to make a city and then use the natural disasters DLC and destroy it
1818,its a very good game il gave it a 10/10
1819,yes best game i always build california on accident
1820,After 2000 in this game you can get a job as a city planner with this on your resume.
1821,>
1822,I flooded the town with copious amounts of poop
1823,This is the best city builder on the market hands down.
1824,"Fun game, but you need a couple of hours.  Real time killer."
1825,i like
1826,why are people complaining about 19% taxes? you are lucky i dont make a island and leave you there to rot
1827,good but dont forget to save cuz no autosave
1828,I love that the streets are named automatically which makes the game unique and special. It is one of my favorite parts about the game.
1829,One of the rare games that I can justify the cost of all the DLC. It is quite pricey but it is the best city builder out there with endless possibilities.
1830,"Seemed pretty intuitive, liked the graphics and different ideas relating to building a small village or hamlet in one small area and building on that. Explanations could be better in how what is being explained affects game play in becoming an incorporated area and building from there. You pretty much learn as you go along and so far that has been fine. Could do better on a particular game you have saved, at least in making it easier to understand how to have multiple saved games."
1831,city
1832,Addictive as hell
1833,"Modders work harder than developers.
I hope a new game with many mods included as default (such as TMPE) will be released, and will be better optimised (memory and cpu)"
1834,Cool af
1835,this game is a great game i played this game all night
1836,Very good
1837,"Simulation is plausible, every choice matters, feels realistic and its therefor great to build a city and watch the problems that go with it come and go."
1838,bockt
1839,good game for killing time
1840,Add reichstag
1841,"Very immersive experience that isn't afraid to test your skills for city planning, availability of land, profit capabilities and importance of resources required at any given time."
1842,"You have to make a Paradox account to play it and there's a ton of ads for the DLC's, ngl it's not worth it now, unless you kinda ignore the extra clutter."
1843,Very fun
1844,This game is super chill. Love it!
1845,"If you like Sim City 4, this is the next level in graphics and game play. 
Learning curve - took a few hours to learn the basics. The controls are different from other city simulations.
"
1846,"Great game made better by mods and DLC, pretty much awesome.
Bought this back in like 2015 or 16, basically shortly after it released after being dissapointed with Sim city. Been playing on and off ever since, and its just gotten better and better, although a 2nd game would a welcome addition. Game is still great though!"
1847,VERY GOOD Wholesome fun
1848,Sometimes I care more about my Sims than I do the real world.
1849,big city go brrrr
1850,Picks up where Sim City left off. Good time killers for laid back entertainment.
1851,ARE YOU GUYS SURE NOT EA??????
1852,Observe your own urban and enviromental catastrophe.
1853,I love everything about this game. It really creates the most immersive city building experience.
1854,"I've grown up playing games like this, starting with SimCity 2000 all the way up to Cities Skylines.  Skylines is by far an amazing City Simulator with endless opportunities for ideas and growth.  Whether you're a beginner to city sims or if you are a City Planner, this game is perfect for all skill levels."
1855,Good game made great with mods.
1856,All around great game

1858,Great city building game!
1859,its a mental illness\
1860,nice
1861,"I grew up on Sim City and Sim City 2000. 

This is a spiritual successor, but is also its own game with its own mechanics and quirks.

One of my favorite things about it is that everything is interconnected - people, individuals, do things, and have jobs. That drives markets, as well as services, and everyone and everything has a life cycle.

This can sometimes be frustrating, but it is also what makes the game interesting and fun - you must learn to balance all of the demands of the city and its people in order to succeed, and you will probably fail the first few times.

Watch some Youtubers like OVERCHARGED EGG and get some basics; a major early failure on my part was not knowing how to elevate roads so as to avoid intersections, which massacred my traffic. PGUP, by the way.

So there is a learning curve, but that is true of all games, and the game tries to help, I am just used to ignoring such messaging. 

Once you get good at it, you can mod it, and get DLC, and work on asthetic improvements to your city - the city can be GORGEOUS when well crafted. It ceases to be so much a matter of min-maxing your grids and much more a canvas upon which you build a work of art - this is the end game.

I recommend, though beware that the DLC adds up - but you don't really need it, it just gives you more assets and a few new game mechanics that make things even more interesting, so it is up to you whether or not a specific DLC is worth your $$ - but I will probably be getting the Green Cities one for the recycling center at the least."
1862,ITS A REALLY GOOD GAME AND RELISTIC I RECOMMEND PLAYING NOW OR NEVER
1863,"OK, I'm more used to blowing stuff up in games than actually building stuff.  I've now found C:S is really challenging to create something respectable, especially from scratch.  It really takes a lot of thought once you get past the first few milestones.  I've melted my brain more than once on C:S (and also Surviving Mars) in trying to solve problems with my designs  I really like this game now (and also Surviving Mars), even though I don't get to blow up anything (Cities at War DLC??? ) or how about an 'explosive demolition' feature add-on as bigger structures tend to be demolished now?  'Bulldoze' just doesn't quite have enough Ummph! :-) 
Something I'd like in the future to challenge the experience is a ready built town/city structure to be available as a start point so you don't have to start with breaking new ground from scratch, and you can set the degree of problems that the town/city starts with.  In any event I will continue to try to generate a megalopolis from a green field, - pretty sure I'll be able to do it by this time next year - If that seems excessive to you then hey -I've other games I have to play to satisfy my need to blow stuff up which C:S just doesn't have... Yet? :-)"
1864,Great game!
1865,good
1866,Ich hasse mehmed
1867,nice
1868,was good
1869,"Getting back into gaming after a VERY long time. I was always drawn to this game for its organic game play, and it does not disappoint. Some games are just click games.... this is NOT one of those. It is like art, you can create anything! I would definitely recommend it to anyone."
1870,city build time yes
1871,"The game is probably good, but the font size borders at unreadable on a laptop. A real shame cuz I normally love these kind of games. If the developer had taken the time to make the size of the in-game texts adjustable I would have gladly kept playing, but as it stands now I've asked for a refund and, if you don't have perfect eyesight, I advise you to not even buy this game."
1872,"Simcity, but grown up. Love it :)"
1873,"Cities: Skylines is a expansive 3D city building game where you are in charge of a city. Zone residential, industrial, commercial and offices. Manage public transport and road systems as you unlock a series of milestones. The game is the best city builder I have bought. The mods system is great and you can install mods that tweak how the game works and add new content + vehicles. It also has a ton of DLC to contribute to your city."
1874,"really fucking complex but still worth a purchase.
one thing i dont like tho is that you cant buy all the dlcs at once"
1875,Great game for people that love Sim City. This game is more advance and very addictive. The mods bring it to the next level. grate for all ages.
1876,"Game is buggy as hell. Loading savegames from the workshop is an absolute nightmare and usually takes an eternity to update. Also it eats up memory like crazy, to the point where I'm constantly uninstalling mods just so the game doesn't crash. I guess it's still better than Sim City."
1877,"Good game, except that the citizens are bitching abt almost everything, and the drivers doesn't have a functional brain"
1878,"I see life differently, instead of blocks and neighborhoods I now see life in u. I look at my city and nearby towns for a better understanding of infrastructure and city planning tips. I have a problem and I don't want help for it."
1879,"Nice game, has alot of cool stuff, maybe add more dlc's in the future? Otherwise a good game. 10/10"
1880,"Originally I got this game for free during a giveaway on epic. When I found out that the steam workshop was where the mainstay of user generated content was, I chose to purchase it here.  This game more than  replaces sim city for my city building kick.  Highly recommended."
1881,this game is awsome.
1882,IDK its pretty good ig
1883,"I won't go over the details of the game because nobody would want to read such an excessive review, but suffice to say the game is as described and is a very good game. Well worth the purchase!"
1884,great ciity building game with a lot to learn from.
1885,You will spend more on dlcs than the actual game
1886,This is by far the best city builder game to exist. the dlc is totally worth it and the workshop mods and assets are incredible. Every time i binge this game i'm never disappointed and always have a great time and hours of fun.
1887,yes
1888,Has a learning curve but once you get over that hump its very fun
1889,400+ hours spent! still enjoy this game
1890,:D
1891,Its good with DLCs :'(
1892,"such an incredible game. great visuals, and ease of use. Easy to play, and challenging to master"
1893,Pretty cool
1894,playing this game and knowing what u are doing keeps the doctor away
1895,"I thought  I would hate it, but in fact I’m addicted now."
1896,"My life is this now.  Only this.  This is everything.

So if you look at the hours I've spent instead of doing anything productive you will probably realise I'm going to recommend this game.  It's just the kind of mindless monotony I need after a long day working for a terrible wage and being shouted at for 8 hours.  I will say though that this is far too expensive, keep an eye on humble bundle and get yourself this and the DLC for pocket change.  This makes the game even more enjoyable than it was originally intended to be."
1897,yes
1898,yes I do but the the game has few bugs about launching the game .
1899,wee
1900,"Even better than the inspiration.  A bit more complex, so its taken me a lil while to get the hang of things. But fun and addictive!  I do feel all politicians should play this game for 6 months without taking bailouts. LOL."
1901,make peple drinke bad water 10/10
1902,n/a
1903,its fun
1904,very fun!
1905,bruh i love this game
1906,cool
1907,I came because of the city building. I stayed because of road planning and intersections.
1908,"Very fun, has very good workshop"
1909,"Best City Simulator ever! As an avid Sim City fan from the Sim City 2000 days to the most recent edition, This game excels with the playability of Sim City 3000, the traffic management of no Sim City game ever, and the ability to customize ever aspect you want and much more. There are too many DLC's in my book which lessens my liking of it, but just a tiny bit. Even the vanilla game is plenty good enough to have a ton of fun for many hours, especially if you use some basic workshop downloads."
1910,very fun
1911,"very good
"
1912,Don't like what you built? Try something different.  I'm always learning more.
1913,Epic thank you
1914,wqerdjuy5tweyjwtrrere
1915,Great game made even better with mods and custom assets
1916,"cities skylines is a game that offers a plethora of different opportunities and player creation choices, where you have free reign on the different styles of cities that you want to build. buying dlc's also opens up the possibilities for new facilities that don't come with the base game, but are well worth the purchase, as it allows finer detailing and new parts to your city. would recommend"
1917,Favorite city building game of all time!
1918,"Obsessed. Took a bit of learning, but even when I didn't know what I was doing it kept me hooked."
1919,fun easy to learn  can get overwhelming but well that's where the challenge starts but you can all ways turn on unlimited funds for a more relaxed game
1920,it good
1921,i can make bumfuck ohio in this
1922,good
1923,great game with tons of strategy
1924,stayed open over night might have been my fault but lost my save still love the game
1925,Really great game. More realistic than you would think and adds a depth to a game that you didn't think was possible.
1926,It's the best city sim there is what more do you need to know
1927,"haha funny number of hours, also good game yes, DLCs are a bit expensive but not required to have fun"
1928,so great
1929,"Too much dlc, not much of a game otherwise. though its not bad."
1930,Its so slay
1931,fun
1932,"There are some games on steam that transcend a community and completely change the way a genre is perceived, played, and enjoyed. Games like Rust and Counter-strike are the classics of steam, played by thousands for more than five years and going.

In the case of Cities Skylines, it has revolutionized the city builder genre, allowing the series to bring in brand new players to stay. The modding versatility releases the game from its own bounds and allows the game to expand past its own limits into a game that will last for years, and has lasted for years. The endless extent of its nature is naturally captivating to anyone looking for a relaxing game, or a challenging political simulator. Its beautiful 3D graphics on release made other similar titles looking like a mario game. 

Cities Skylines has something for everyone, it is now a MUST HAVE STEAM CLASSIC. Its a game which lasted and will last for many years unchallenged by rival titles in the genre. It will be and has been enjoyed by most people on the steam community. It sits among the ranks of Counter-strike, Rust, and Dota in pure game-time potential. It has raised the bar for what is a good city builder game requires. 

I enjoyed playing this game for 149.9 hours, and will be returning to this title for the next couple of years until something new knocks it off its throne."
1933,"great game play, amazin graphics"
1934,I love this place
1935,Its fun!
1936,"If you've ever considered building a very small city, this game is for you."
1937,SUIIII SCOLTAND IS BERTTER THAN ENGLAND
1938,100 dollars for all the dlc? *shits and dies*
1939,Time flies when you play this game. It is so fun and i love modding my game to fit my wants. I highly recommend this game.
1940,yup
1941,It is a very fun game about creating cities. The graphics and game are very realistic but any PC should be able to handle it.
1942,"While the base game is a competent Sim City alternative. I found my interest not being held at the time, and the amount of content in the base game somewhat lacking. Those screenshots all look lovely don't they? But you won't likely get your own cities like that - certainly not without at least £200+ worth of DLCs.

And that is really the reason this gets a NO from me.........

[h2]ANOTHER MONEY GRUBBING GREEDY DEVELOPER SPEWING DYSENTRIES OF DLCs (there's 38 of them as I write this review...... 3 are free, but will probably offer shit, most are around the £5 or less area, some are £10+ and you probably don't need all of them - so could be worse I suppose, go look at DCS World or FSX for example!)[/h2]"
1943,"seems a good game until you have to deal with traffic, then you spend all your life trying to resolve the traffic problem, and you end creating more problems.

still love creating inceneration plants near child hospitals"
1944,its really cool although the dlc is expensive i really lobve it

1949,Outstanding work by Paradox. Best city builder ever done.
1950,nice....
1951,"It's a no because of the dlc prices, as if 2 dlc's would be worth a whole game... Some dlc's should even have been included as an update. Looking back, I shouldn't have supported this."
1952,they should add labour camps so i can complete my dream dictatorship
1953,i kill my people
1954,"I enjoy this game but you have to install a mod to play multiplayer/co op

I got this product for ~10€ on steam summer sale."
1955,Good game enhanced with addons
1956,Fine game. Not much else to say
1957,"Excellently put together. No bugs I've noticed so far, graphics are just amazing. Very little limitation in what you can build and where you can build it. Also, the game is the perfect mix of micro-management and hands off, policy-type management."
1958,Just eff'in great
1959,Amazing
1960,The perfect game to waste time to.
1961,Roby and tax recommend against this game.
1962,"Fun game for playing if you like maps or urban planning or numbers. Would pay full price but you should get on sale
"
1963,Lost my mind trying to fix an intersection for 15 minutes.
1964,build city fun lol
1965,i like making life as miserable as possible for my citizens
1966,Great UI design. Modding base is very epic. Would recommend playing with DLC but without is also fun.
1967,Addictive.
1968,awesome game
1969,"Whenever I try play the game it just crashes my entire laptop despite it being able to run Microsoft Flight Sim. Broken game I spent quite alot of money on this game, Dissapointed"
1970," Great

1971,city make bust
1972,how do i traffic
1973,Good solid game if you like city builders this is the best one around. Got great mods to help boast the look and replay of the game.

1977,"I love the freedom I have to build. Doesn't run well on my crappy laptop, but if I had a desktop it would be a lot better.worth every penny!"
1978,This game really is amazing. But honestly it's very hard sometimes. I myself can play without unlimited money bc I'm not big brain enough to make everyone happy and get more money in the beginning. And then the traffic issues and big brain you need to get the AI to figure out your roads is a whole other issue lol. I'm a wreck. But none the less its still amazing. And omg once you REALLY get going... *mwah* French kiss. It's beautiful and satisfying.  I def recommend this game.
1979,Well i havent played this game for very long but so far it's pretty entertaining.
1980,Rode higherarky
1981,love this game more than most other games  cant wait for cs2
1982,"This game is addicting and nice to play when you have nothing else to do. Get your cup of warm drink, open mind and set of keyboard and mouse to start planning and building. It really is addicting... and fun. I recommend using mods really is helpful.

1989,the best game ever because you can do so muck stuff in the game and you can get lots of mods . you make a city or towns too its very fun
1990,very great
1991,"Doesn't work on M1 Macs. It will technically run, but it's garbage resolution, garbage graphics quality, and entirely unsupported.

Such a disappointment - and apparently would be easy to fix."

its super fun and actually freeing to be able to build things on your own

play this game.. NOW!"
1993,"good

1994,Very good game
1995,Without a doubt the best city builder to date
1996,"This is a good city building game.

My learning curb required two restarts of the game & now 17 hours in iv come to realise it's one of those rear games I will spend hundreds of hours playing ( not even 10 games over many years have reached that highbar ).

Havent played it enough yet to know if it's equal to the standards of Kerbal space program & Factorio but this is a game worth owning!"
1997,"It's good
fun and 
entertaining"
1998,I love playing it! Its so fun
1999,"Literally no tutorial or any kind of help. For new players the game literally says:""fck you"". It looked cool and I wanted to get into it, but the game literally doesn't have any kind of tutorial. Trash. 

I won't talk about the hundreds of dollars worth of dlcs because this is just disgusting."

2015,its the best gam everrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr!!!!!!!

2030,I love how you can mod it for free to your liking and make it as realistic as possible or as simulation as possible. It all depends on how you look at it or how you want to play the game.

2042,"Yes, it's addictive as sin. Yes, there's huge amounts of DLC to be funded by your obsession. Yes, most of them should have been included with the main game. No, the devs didn't bother to translate the game to their own language. 

Kyllä, se on koukuttavaa kuin synti. Kyllä, siihen on järjettömät määrät lisäosia hyväksikäyttämään pakkomiellettä. Kyllä, suurin osa niistä pitäisi olla osa pääpeliä. Ei, kehittäjät eivät vaivaantuneet kääntämään peliä omalle kielelleen."
2043,SimCity but comprehensive and can be paused. Sheesh
2044,Finally getting the hang of this magnificent game :-)
2045,yes yes veri gut
2046,"Probably (and most likely) THE BEST MODERN CITY BUILDER, although it came out in 2015 this game has not aged, it has so many features and can keep you playing for hours even in the vanilla game, it has a lot of dlc and content packs but really thats if you want to. THE MODS!!!!! it has so many mods, easy to make and even easier to put in your game! This has to be one of my favorite games of all time and the price is completly worth"
2047,"The Vanilla version of The Game is an Amazing City Building simulator with amazing graphics 
there are a lot assets and mods in workshop and they can make your game even better 

you can build everything in cities skylines. suburbs , residential , towers , huge metro systems, and much more . 

you can even create amazing landscapes using workshop assets and it will be  Amazing 

TRY THE GAME WITH DLCS FOR BETTER EXPERIENCE 
"
2048,"Cities: Skylines is a thematic evolution of SimCity that brings tremendous modern updates to the game genre, as well as deep, rich, nuanced city management gameplay as you must manage population, demand, supply, ordnances, budget, all the fun things we enjoy from the SimCity franchise, but with more modern UI and more sophisticated gameplay.

From the technical standpoint you won't be dissapointed with an approachable UI, decent tutorials, and a full gamut of graphics, visual and audio tweaks, enough to satisfy any enthusiast PC gamer.

Now, like all Paradox games this is essentially incomplete and there's a ridiculously insulting DLC tax if you actually want the full game (hundreds of dollars), but you don't need to pay any of this because a huge amount of what you want here is available free through the Steam Workshop (certainly a winning initiative from Valve, 100% pro-gamer move). 

So, grab the core game when it's cheap, don't waste your time on overpriced DLC, and you'll be in the sweet spot that the black hole mismanagement of EA's SimCity franchise left the gaming industry has left us.  Hundreds of hours of enjoyment for very little money if you grab this on sale or in the frequent bundles it appears in, and if you need more, the Workshop will keep you going for hundreds more hours.  You can't lose on this one."
2049,Simcity but better! 8/10 wish there wasn't so many pay DLC's to replay this game despite the mods provided.
2050,good game.
2051,"This is a fun, stressful little game that is the simulation of dreams."
2052,"reject car

embrace train"
2053,"This is a Paradox game, which means it has 50 DLCs. I can't say I feel they're worth the investment, in this case.

It's smoother and better than any SimCity I've ever played, but has some of the problems inherent to the genre that I don't find appealing -- gating off decent roads being my most immediate complaint with every city.

The water physics, both clean and brown, are... odd, to say the least. You can reverse the flow of the river, or stop it with a dam that nevertheless does not generate power or leak."
2054,Simply Lovely it is!
2055,i liked the game so much but building a town and then thinking about it growing in to a city bruh the roads lol
2056,Good game. Get it.
2057,"The lag I get is inane given the fact when i first got the game i was playing on med-high settings with 60 fps,kind of a bummer cause i only got to play this game literally twice and i had a lot of fun."

2060,I love this game
2061,It's cool
2062,Probably the best game paradox has made.
2063,ok
2064,i crashed after 3 hours of editing my fucking city like why
2065,"It is a GREAT game... very ""thinky"" and time absorbing... FULLY recommend on sale with ALL the DLC... ----BUT--- even though some of the DLC adds almost nothing to the game that can't be found on the Workshop, figuring out which are required take WAY more brain space that running the most complicated city.  Paradox has some of the GREATEST games, but their DLC policy is the purest example of Dev greed I've ever seen."

2078,The best city building game
2079,"I began playing Cities: Skylines around a couple of years ago in console due to the lack of recent city builders set in the modern era since SImCity, and I remember playing it when it was still being developped I thought the game was going to get better with time, much better, here's the thing it didn't and after a bit I said why not buy it on PC to play around with mods, I'm sorry to be brutal with my wording but even on PC this game is dogshit.

I will mostly be judging the game from a vanilla standpoint as mods are made by the independent community and the developpers at Paradox deserve no praise for them, although their efforts to push forward community efforts is admirable, the fact that the community does 90% of the game's development is truly telling.

The graphics, even by 2015 standards, are BAD, like really bad. The base game has blurry textures, some other textures clip through terrain, zooming in on anything shows stretched and blurred textures to the point where I would recommend that you play only with a graphics mod. Even much smaller studios have developped games such as Ostriv where graphics are very well done, Paradox meanwhile thought they could leave all the work to the community.

The gameplay is average at best and bad at worst, traffic is broken and the game overall is shallow without mods. In the base game there are 10 buildings max for each category with very little variety in what to build every city ends up with commercial, industrial and residential zones accompagnied by a couple of service buildings that look the exact same. 

Initially the game seemed to be a promising development path but now, in typical Paradox fashion may I add, every single new feature has been locked behind expensive DLC. 90% of the game's DLC are features you would expect to have in most vanilla games such as radio stations and transport buildings. It also doesn't help that the DLCs are very expensive and there are many, just today I saw that the full game DLC cost around 225 euros which is unreasonable and a fucking joke.

Overall Cities: Skylines reflects many of Paradox's previous titles, lazy developpers who rely entirely on the community to do their job, bland and shallow gameplay and hundreds of dollars/euros worth of DLC that without the game is an empty shell. I can't recommend this game unless you either have a good PC with which you can mod a lot with or want to spend 200 (maybe 300 in the future) euros worth of DLC for."
2080,Skylines of the Cities
2081,"The best city builder out there. Detailed, immersive, and modder-friendly. Unlimited replayability value."
2082,This game is so addictive!

2090,"Calling this a spiritual successor to the SimCity series is not an accurate description. It does pretty much everything that series has done and more. Much more. With that in mind: Wait for a sale before you buy this, while the barrage of DLC it received throughout the years keeps it alive and active, this game has aged quite a bit.

If you absolutely must have a DLC when you start, I recommend getting Mass Transit and Sunset Harbor. Content creator packs are overrated, overpriced and did not age well. For each one there are dozens of better alternatives in the Workshop.

500 hours in and counting, I’ll probably put in 500 more. The good outshines the bad, and there’s really nothing else quite like it. It’s a mostly meditative game with a touch of urgency just enough to keep it engaging.

2091,Great citybuilding game :)
2092,Best city builder ever. Nuff said!

2104,Love it! I love creating a futuristic city
2105,♥♥♥♥☻☻☻☺☺

2109,great mind boggler
2110,This game brings the need to plan a city properly to light by creating a solid infrastructure.
2111,i build citee gud yis
2112,yes
2113,"I'm a sucker for city builders and Skylines has blown me away. I do miss some of the features of CitiesXL, but Skylines has done an incredible job of expanding and capitalizing the genre while staying focused on the community and staying MOD friendly."
2114,"Very fun way to pass the time, however it is hard to get good at. But if you have the time and commitment to get good and build a great city, go for it! I think it was worth the 30 bucks, but it's completely up to you on what you think about the game."
2115,I used to play this game on console when I didn't have a PC. I bought a PC for this game because I wanted mods and custom assets. I love this game.
2116,"This game is great, but TMPE and Dynamic Resolution are must-have mods."
2117,I love Flint Michigan
2118,highly recommended
2119,"This game is just great, but when u get certain population, its unplayeable, i was never able to fix, death wave or other stuff"
2120,Brilliant City Builder and with all the MODS and extra stuff you can do it really is limitless as to what you can do
2121,Just a fun game. This is what other city builders should have become. It does have a bit of a learning curve but you can adjust easy and with build in mods anyone can take their time and learn it. The ad dons as priced well and not needed to enjoy the game but they do enhance it. Really good pick if you need something fun to play.
2122,best simulation game of the century
2123,Dlc expensive but fun nevertheles
2124,"I have entirely too much fun playing this, it's everything Sim City should've been. The modders have turned it into something that shattered every expectation I could have for a city building game. Looking forward to blowing another 500 hours here."
2125," This my favourite ever, so fun i love the mechanics"
2126,Good
2127,very much has good
2128,Yeah it's really fun especially with mods.
2129,Fun
2130,everything keeps on flooding
2131,Always one of those games I come back to and still enjoy after all these years
2132,This game is good but you pretty much need the DLCs to make it immersive

2143,Awesome game.
2144,"Good game, you should buy it!"
2145,is very fun however unlocking some buildings is stupid
2146,"The game itself is great, with lots of customization. Avoiding traffic congestion seems to be the biggest of just a few small challenges that you have to keep in mind.
If that is all you care about, go ahead!

Well. The base game is just fine. But as it is a game by paradox, the amount of extra dlc is... - just have a look.
However: Having fun with a game, hours and hours, and wanting to support devs for it can easily make up for that, if you have this mindset.

What cannot be excused as easily is the launcher they added some time ago. Advertisements, data collection and the simple waste of time whenever you just want a game to launch after clicking on it.
Not having played for a few years and now finally wanting to return to it - I reconsidered after that launcher popped up."

2152,"Fun and easy to learn, explore this game, it has many fun stuff to do!"
2153,The mods really make just about anything possible so you can create anything to your heart's desire. I would recommend a few DLCs and Content creator packs that unlock alternate forms of transport and industries.

2161,"Time played not accurate. 
This game has turned into a cycle of breaking every mod and impossible menu navigation for the sake of more. I can't advise giving this company money anymore, the EULA privacy policy is essentially tantamount to a release agreement. This game company used to be decent, but with the emergence of greed, so dies good faith. Fair the well junk pile."

2168,perfect for testing mild-genocidal tendencies !!
2169,"Fell asleep a couple of hours in the morning and when i woke up i found out my city was in ruin and i owned 100k. So if i learned anything from this game is to never sleep as a Mayor, like ever."
2170,"It's fun; you definitely find yourself burning a ton of hours making everything perfect. Great for ADD/ADHD, OCD, or just if you've got time to spend making a cool little city."

2173,"Base game is barely good, and has very shitty models and assets, some of the ugliest things I saw in a city builder.

But there's a magical thing called the Steam Workshop, and it improves greatly over the base game. And then you realize the devs created a very robust and solid framework for everyone to crate their city-building dream. The mods are 95% of what this game is about.

Thanks Colossal Order !"
2174,In this game we are supposed to build city.
2175,If you like to build cities this is the game for you.
2176,"I bought the game a few nights ago, I’m obsessed. I’m still a beginner and learning the mechanics slowly. Starting to get into the mods, started a city just vanilla but wanted to try mods out so I started another one. So far so good! Really enjoying the game."
2177,Spent 3 hours making a roundabout. 10/10

2181,cool
2182,This game is really great you can be yourself to achieve whatever your wildest dream in city building
2183,"If you're a fan of titles like sim city, this is the next evolution of the genre. It's got fantastic 3D environments with complex systems interacting in the form of residents, industry and commerce, and has an INCREDIBLE modding scene.

Only downfall is the vast amount of DLC currently available that can easily quadruple the base game price. However, the base game does an incredible job, so whether or not this is a dealbreaker is something you'll need to decide on."
2184,This game is everything SimCity should've been.

2201,"Cities: Skylines, a spiritual successor to the SimCity series, is the best city-building game I personally have ever played.

[h1]Strengths and Flaws[/h1]

The traffic simulation is the most in-depth aspect of the game, and it provides plenty of interesting challenges for the player to deal with.  The game provides tools such as mass transit, an intersection builder, and tunnels to manage traffic.  Traffic is the one aspect of the game most open to micromanagement, but such things are not forced on the player in the early stages of city growth.

Other game systems, such as crime and healthcare, are not as well thought-out as the traffic, but they do contribute to having a good experience.  I must say that the Monuments—big, expensive endgame buildings—are so powerful they make entire city services obsolete, and this makes city design less interesting because it removes a single challenge entirely.

The aesthetic of the game is lovely—the music is good, and the art is gorgeous—if only my computer could handle it.  Despite the game’s many flaws (most of which are too minor for me to list here), it still is enjoyable and has held my attention for hundreds of hours.

[h1]Why I Stopped Playing[/h1]

Cities: Skylines is a huge game.  Between the base game and all the DLCs and mods I have installed, it’s too intense for my computer to handle.  Do note that the minimum specs listed on the Store page are the minimum needed to load the main menu, but to actually play the game you will need more than 8GB RAM.  For reference, the computer I used to play this on has only 8GB RAM, and I turned the game to its lowest graphics setting, and still I found it better to measure frame rate in seconds per frame than in frames per second.

Don’t even think about buying this game unless you have a good gaming computer, or if you’re from the future and have a better computer than I do now.  If you are absolutely sure your computer can handle this game, then it’s worth playing."
2202,Fun game
2203,yes
2204,still epic
2205,cant tell if its me or the car ais who are bad at traffic
2206,best

2209,it's not launching
2210,Best city builder by far.
2211,"Great game, fun stuff."
2212,"A wonderful way to consume all your excess time ... good thing I just retired.  You can play this game at so many levels ... from basically zoning everything and watching your city grow or with mods, you can create very realistic cities.  I do both and I am glad that the game is flexible to accommodate various play styles."
2213,.
2214,good game
2215,The funnest thing to do in this game is to destroy your city with a tsunami of poo poo. You can even zoom in and watch the people and vehicles get washed away by the dookie.
2216,"Great game!!! I used to play Simcity, then I found this and I loved it."
2217,"Fix your roads simulator.

Pros: mod support, chill gameplay, one of the best city building games out there
Cons: it's a paradox game so expect 40 DLCs

Oh, and if you want to run a decent amount of mods and be able to play, you need 32 GB of RAM, my instance of game usually takes 24 GB"

2229,i really love this game from day 1. the only problem i got was when i did not use mods back then. the game it self only takes you so far but mods on the other hand make a great addition to the game to make it more creative and easier to do certain things. it is a really good game and i will never forget it.

2276,This is a good if you like building cities.
2277,The base game is good. Lots of fun to play and figure out how the mechanics work. Adding DLC packs and/or mods makes it 20x better. There is so much that can be done and built in this game once you start adding mods and expansions. Might not be worth the full price but MORE than worth getting on a steam sale!!

2285,Enormous possibilities. Overcome the economic challenges and your imagination can run wild. Genuinely fabulous fun.
2286,"People keep saying this game is better than SimCity, and I just don't see it. I hate EA as much as the next guy, but this game is severely limited. You can't upgrade your buildings with more hospital rooms or classrooms, traffic AI takes the stupid route imaginable, it keeps assigning the most buses to run the least-used bus routes, and to top it all off I just hit my ""tree limit"". I've built on maybe half of the 4 plots I've bought (the connected expandable plots are nice) but I can't place any more goddamn trees. No trees, of any type. Sure, there's always a mod to fix things, but devs didn't make the mods, they made this shitty ass game."
2287,"The best sandbox you've played in since you were a kid.  The one thing I wish it had.. especially early in the game is a planning tool for roads.  Where you can lay out roads and make changes without actually buying, building and maintaining them.  Then when you are ready, buy and build them one section at a time like road improvements.  JUST SAYING.   
I don't have hours to spend on gaming.  I like that I can spend 1 hour at a time or a whole day and it's still engaging.  DLC is worth it.  Mods are good.  PS  Don't even try this game without the auto bulldoze mod.  Your life will be much better."

2322,"Overall this game is good, but I hate that I am forced to build the dirtiest of technologies based solely upon population size. Why must I be forced to dump my city waist into the river and continue doing so until I reach a population of 4,000 when I already have plenty of tax income to buy it with 1,000 population? My small city is thriving, why must I be arbitrarily limited from building a non polluting city without a DLC?"

It's very challenging in the beginning but once you get more experience it becomes really fun. You have to experiment and trial and error is the best way to learn imo."

2339,The only game that gives me physical and emotional trauma after downloading 100 mods

"
2354,its a great city simulator game. if that's your thing this is probably one of the best and with the dlc and mods you can get from fine grained detail to super fine grained detail.
2355,Eventually I will stop playing this game obsessively--but not today Satan.
2356,"This game will take so many hours of your life

2358,proper banger
2359,"Game Broke after I downloaded a couple mods, didn't work since.
Had fun when it worked tho

9/10"
2360,This is the best city builder that money can buy!
2361,"It's absolutely amazing how addicting this game can become in such a short amount of time. I love finding new ways to maximize productivity in the city I create and I love the creativity in the items you can unlock. The optional DLC that you can purchase can seriously enhance your gameplay, but I would recommend playing the game without any of the DLC at first and then slowly purchasing them over time so you can get a feel for how each one works. The community-made mods also help ensure you never get tired of the content in the game. Overall I love this game and couldn't resist also buying it on my Switch to play it on the go (but the PC version is definitely superior)"
2362,A brilliant city builder game
2363,An amazing game.
2364,I've played for 70 hours but really got nowhere.  I love the game but I'm finding it way more involved/challenging than SimCity 2000.  For an older game it sure has a great following and I find myself enjoying more the setup of the road infrastructure as opposed to trying to actually keep up with the game play itself.  Also a big fan of watching City Skyline builds from Biffa and City Planner Plays and others.
2365,m
2366,I like how in depth it is. Definitely a learning curve if you're not familiar with this type of game but still worth.
2367,"definitely my favourite game, highly recommend if you like these kinda games"
2368,"Absolutely love playing this game, especially with mods because it can really amp up the creativity of your builds/cities. This game sucks you in, and you can get lost in it sometimes for hours which to me makes it a really immersive and fun game to play."
2369,Made a city with a skyline. Am now hundreds of mods in. This is the progression.
2370,Best game in history
2371,"Definitely a good city builder with lots of things to keep track of, though you don't necessarily have to get too deep if you don't want to. If you don't care about achievements, I highly recommend turning on the infinite oil and ore mod built into the game on the main menu. The oil and ore reserves in the game deplete very rapidly otherwise."
2372,"with the amounts of mods that I can add into the maps, it's a super great and real game and totally a recommended game from me"
2373,good
2374,"TL;DR It's a game that costs way too much DLC wise and should only be bought if you just want the base game that is boring in more ways than one.

If you're into spending $150+ to actually play a fun-ish city sim game, have fun with that. Otherwise, just go play something else since the base game is honestly quite boring and most content you would find included in games like sim city for free is now behind that massive DLC paywall that Paradox seems to like to put into their games these days. They have managed to wall off about 60-70% of what you could want from a city sim behind DLC. Basically, the DLC has more content all together than the actual fuckin' game. The prices for the DLCs aren't helpful either at around $15 a pop for the ""major"" ones. The two that really ticked me off though has to be the ""Snowfall"" and ""Natural Disasters"" DLCs. These could have easily just been patched in, hell you find natural disasters in the EA tumor of a game for free.

Now, what might be so bad about this you might ask? Well, take a step back and look at what these DLCs actually add. I'll save you the trouble, about 1 or 2 actual pieces of content (arguably) which half of could have easily been put into the game without having to sell part of your liver to actually afford them. With Snowfall, you get seasons and trams. Seasons and such should honestly just be in the game it's so simplistic and the only useful part being the trams kinda makes the $12.99 you'd pay pretty steep. Another DLC, ""After Dark"", has one feature that seems like a joke at first:[i] ""Criminals will now be taken to Prison from Police buildings."" [/i] I read this thinking ""Oh that's pretty neat!"" until my brain snapped back to reality and started wondering where in the fuck they were going before. This should be a part of this already and not a main feature in a DLC. I guess before this DLC, their body and soul just got sacrificed to the void for all eternity for their crimes.

This would be alright if pretty much all of the major DLCs that add to gameplay weren't $13-$15 each making this cost far more than it really has a need to be.

Let's do some math: 

There are 5 DLCs that are $14.99 and 5 that are $12.99.

5 * 14.99 = 74.95 and 5 * 12.99 = 64.95.

74.95 + 64.95 = 139.90.

$140 for a bit of extra content not even including the base game. 

If you like a plain city sim and don't care for DLCs, have at it. But honestly, I'm going to stick a good distance away and probably not play this game again. If you spent the money for the DLCs... well good on you and hope to god that buyer's remorse doesn't hit before you start playing with them."
2375,"Quite good game, i got one of the bundles with the industries dlc and sunset harbour game worked fine but after opening it the next day it refused to open. Now only works on my brothers laptop :/"
2376,"One of the best game to understand management, traffic. Playing since 5 years and still lot to learn."
2377,If I had to choose to only ever play 1 game it would be this one.
2378,it's really good

2380,"Best city builder game ive played.  Only negative is the amount of DLC's you need to purchase to experience the whole that the game has to offer.  However, if youre smart and do your research, you can easily skip certain DLCs and get the same expereince whilst saving a chunk of money.   4/5 stars"
2381,"Very good game that lets you know the basics of infrastructure building. However, i feel it is not beginner friendly and needs a guided tutorial so that those who want to try the game aren't overwhelmed by the sheer amount of information overload and intricacies of the game."
2382,really is the next best thing your looking for a sim city type game. honestly even better really hoping for a cities skylines 2
2383,"The dlc's are way to overpriced and are required for the full experience, game is good when you feed paradox all your money, and to paradox as a little tip, lower the price of your dlc's.   More people will buy them and you'll make more money even though the price is low."
2384,"Hands down the best city simulator out there I have ever played as far as realism, versatility, and simulation go."
2385,Better than Simcity
2386,playing for 69 hours has made me think of what a great game this is

2397,cities skylines is an amazing game and takes advantage of the steam workshop better than any other game. the game has managed to stay so popular over the last 7 years thanks to the amazing and supportive devs and the even more amazing community. this game is great for people looking to sink 100s of hours into making something unique and intraquate.
2398,Very nice game if you have a pc with muscles  :)
2399,"Pro: its a good game if you like building cities and you can waste hours on it just not really noticing it

Con: it kinda need more ram because some of the mod/assets just eat it like it was candy."
2400,Good game. Mods make it even better.
2401,it's addicting. spent 8259 hours playing - had it for several years. I literally lose entire weekends to it. So if that's not for you then I'd say pass it up.

2411,I'm still a better urban planer than Elon Musk will ever be.
2412,"So I mostly played this game in the first few years after release, and it always felt like a proper sequel to SC3K and SC4, successfully transitioning to 3D and keeping that classic feel where the skill floor can be very low but the skill ceiling can be very high. Only problem was performance issues - at 250k population it took forever for a single day to pass and the RAM usage was astronomical. But things were improving and the initial expansions were interesting - adding stuff like emergency management or better transit management or things to bring it up to parity with SC3KU or SC4.

So I stopped playing for a few years and came back to it when the expansions were all out and the ""mostly"" finished version was out. Now I'm just disappointed. The performance issues are still there, and they're even worse. The expansions follow the now-classic Paradox model of having some base features for ""free"" with every base patch but leaving in all the annoying UI elements and ""reminders"" that you haven't bought the new DLC. The content of the new DLC itself seems to be either useless, or suboptimal, or extremely broken.

Like, the boat/ferry transit options, or the blimp transit options? Why even have those? They don't have enough thoroughput to make a difference unless you're just playing pure sandbox and making a pretty city. How about the zone-based DLC features, like the parks, weird new industrial areas, university, and airports? Well, they take up entirely too much space compared to simply using their base game ploppable equivalents. The only real reason to use them is either to give you busiwork to do, to add a little bit of meaningless customization to your city, or to abuse them and break the game. Otherwise they're inferior to the regular ploppables, and if you want to exploit them to break the game, why not just use a cheat mod?

It'd be fine if the DLC was completely optional. To some extent it is, save for the annoying reminders that you haven't bought the DLC, and the fact that the game seems to be balanced around using them, and that their presence in the game even if not used has completely brought the performance down. Oh well.

It was fun, I enjoyed my time with it. I can't recommend it anymore."
2413,yes
2414,"W game, L Cities XXL"
2415,good
2416,"Cities Skylines is the best city planning sim yet, and has been that way for a while now. There is just something about starting from an empty plot of land, and slowly building up a little town from nothing. First you setup your small neighbourhoods then you build commercial areas, and then you move on to industrial complexes. You manage the growing demands of your population: The basics, plumbing, electricity and then more complex ones like waste management, healthcare, public transit. You build parks, and infrastructure. You manage traffic, pave roads, and build bridges. You get the idea.

Just like any Paradox game this game also has tons of DLCs, thats how it remained relevant for so long. They release a bare bones demo like game and then slowly add in things that should've been in the game since the start. But if I played the devils advocate, I gotta say, the DLCs in C:S are a lot cheaper and have decent content on them. I got all of the main expansions on a sale and I don't regret it at all. But thats about the only cons this game has, if you're looking for a city sim this is it. Just buy on sale!"
2417,It's a good game. If they would include more in the base game that would be great. Much fun content is behind a paywall and I understand they need to do that but I find it a bit to exagurated and they could treat the original buyers some stuff now and then. There's just to many addons to buy
2418,goated game for relaxation until traffic flow drops to 30% and u have to rebuild ur city
2419,I enjoy playing city builders but also enjoy a challenge I and don’t give a damn about the masses. Another company who only cares about their pockets and not making an honest game. I recently discovered that they maliciously hide income manipulation in their code. Good or bad it does not matter they make sure everyone succeeds. I’m not looking to have my hand held. I’m done. This game is nothing more than a traffic simulator.
2420,good game
2421,It is better than the contemporary Sid Meyers city builder.
2422,"I have been playing city sims like this since Sims City 2000. (yes its been a teensy tiny bit). So Cities Skylines is like that but taken up to 11. Then add on the overwhelming Workshop Community's amazing international mod contributions over the years and this game will keep your inner city developer occupied like forever. Admittedly, its an older game but its still a go to staple for my city simming even now. Cities Skylines has everything and more many of us wished Sims City by EA should have had. But I am not touching that. Any who, if you love planning, developing, building and managing cities, you can not go wrong by giving this game some of your time. Just be prepared to lose hours of your day once you get started. A fair warning."
2423,"The amount of RAM this game needs is irrational, 16Gb won't cut it if you want to make a decent city. Just buy this game if its for sale, 200$ for the game and the DLCs is a robbery."
2424,Kinks to be worked out but an overall fantastic city simulator. Paradox Interactive is a true master of grand strategy.
2425,"A great dive into basic city planning and resource management, with the opportunity to explore traffic routing, zoning, transport and industrial extraction. Once you've gotten to grips with the basic tools, the game introduces levels of complexity gradually as your population grows, which in the mid-game can become overwhelming for some. But patience and trying different maps and combinations bears fruit in the long run. Fans have created some great modding/workshop material to give you more variety to explore. Take the reins and get building!"
2426,good strategy game
2427,"If you like city building games, then this one is for you.  So much better than other games I've tried, with a lot more features and details.  You control just about everything, especially when you add mods to the mix."
2428,Good city builder with great support on the workshop to further improve an already good game.
2429,slayed

2436,"Oh geez, what a president (or maybe mayor) simulator, it's really cool. Maybe I can be the next president in Indonesia and beat the ""bull"" party, ah yes I want tha-"
2437,It is a fun game you can spend many hours with. Warning: The sun may come up before you realize you have been playing all night long
2438,"خیلی کیری نبود
"
2439,"The vanilla version of this game is okay but it rises to absolutely brilliant if you add the DLCs plus some of the  mods and assets from the Workshop. On the downside it is an old game that has some odd requirements, like a huge amount of RAM plus a massive swap file if you want to go all in with the mods and assets. 

I have thousands of hours in this game and still find new challenges and ideas. The community on YouTube is amazing and much better than for many other games. The Facebook community provides a lot of help, advice and ideas. The developer has built in support for the community and has employed some of the best modders to join their team. There are different ""flavours"" of Skylines players, from people who play the game as a game to people who create static dioramas of amazing and beautiful detail."
2440,very fun game tbh
2441,This game works sometimes but most of the time won't launch.  You can google a ton of fixes but they all just kinda work.  In the end you'll spend more time trying to get it to work than playing it
2442,Great city building game
2443,veri gyd :)
2444,"A game where you're meant to build crazy metropolises and develop new possibilities with the many DLC (half of them literally suck) and your imagination... Or you could just drown your citizens in sewage and force your citizens through American level tax rates.

This game is so great, with a variety of maps that you can build your metropolises... or just drown your cit-

10/10 your best option is to kill your workers that has been abused enough"
2445,"Cities: Skylines is THE city management experience. This game is what SimCity should've been. Everything from the taxes, to the radio stations is magnificent, this is my go-to city planner game. I just wish some things weren't DLC exclusive, though I understand"

2460,.
2461,It's a lot of fun and can be very challenging. I recommend setting a timer for yourself or you might unknowingly play for hours. Lots of custom options and ways to plan your dream city.
2462,"Random errors, loading time about 15 minutes and more. I´m realyy angry when error pops-up and the game don´t save.  Hours of creating city goes to trash. This game actually broke my Pc."
2463,Simply the best City building game out there. DLC is not required but it adds much to the game. Parks and Industries being some of the most useful to me for building. Then there is the vast collection of custom assets and all the wonderful things in the Steam Workshop. Mods allow you to do anything you'd like and add a whole other level of realism and features.

2470,Growing up on games like Sim City ever since Sim City 2013 I was missing a good City Sim and this hits all the right spots for me. It's been a while since I had this much fun on a singleplayer game and I can tamper with any small detail I want. Nomenclature was one of my biggest wants and this has it. you can name any street and that's a win in my books.

"
2492,"Very good simulation, you can find really good useful items on steam workshop"
2493,I hate water
2494,"This runs great, looks great, and has excellent mod support. Cities: Skylines is easily the crown jewel of the city building genre at time of writing. Education on traffic management not included (but you might need some).

I realised that this game had gotten away from me when I was three hours deep into plotting out ring roads and highways for my city of 75 thousand people. Plumbing, electricity, policy, public transport, landscaping, pollution, zoning - every aspect of your city is open for inspection and adjustment. The depth of it all is staggering.

I'm going to bow out before this consumes all my free time, which is probably the strongest recommendation I can give to a game. City builders rejoice, this is the game for you.

Bit of a shame about the DLC bloat though."
2495,LANJIAU
2496,is good
2497,I'm still in traffic.... :(
2498,"I'm recommending it because it's good but this comment is gonna be about the negatives mostly. Basically, this game probably needs a sequel to really reach the potential it has. That is, the game can't really be fixed without a full teardown; in principle the city-building experience is unsatisfying from the perspective of a city planner. You can't achieve the kind of density and pedestrian centric structure urbanists like because so much of the game is driven fundamentally by auto-transit and logistics. You also can't build a satisfying rural townscape for similar reasons; the land (and water) scaping is pretty shallow and finnicky, and the camera isn't great for exploring viewscapes. 

More importantly though, the optimization sucks. This isn't a surprise, it's a first entry into a series, but if it's the last, it's gonna be a shame. Everyone knows how bad this game chugs when your city gets big; when you have too many assets, too much landscaping, it's very RAM hungry and, not for very good reason. It's fundamentally just a bit messy and I think a new game could simplify the base to run much, much cleaner. And this is an especially worthy goal because...

This game is best enjoyed with loads of mods. If you go by the $1 per hour game value philosophy, yeah this game is still worth it full price vanilla. But it's way, way better with mods. The workshop is the lifeblood of this game. And having a modded to heck game is something people need to jump through hoops to do a lot of times, because of the demands of the game, but also because of updates and DLC and such. Many common mods should just be made base-game features. Modders should be prioritized and accomodated in any future version. There's so much potential for this game to be a real juggernaut in the general world of gaming, but it needs to take a big step to get there. I hope they do it."
2499,The only City simulator game to play
2500,"Excellent game, always come back and put in a couple hours in some downtime to build a new city and improve ."
2501,best city sim
2502,I started playing this on console then moved to PC for the mods and I wish I could have brought my saves over from the console to improve them with mods but so far I'm really impressed with the mods and features available on the PC version.
2503,"Beginning is kinda bad but as u build ur city it will become more enjoyable

2512,good
2513,Cool
2514,"if youre looking for a game which you as an individual that simply enjoys to build cities and let your imagination go wild this IS the game for you. Me as someone who has a creative mind and wants to create something big like towns and cities, this was and has always been the perfect game for me. Of course there is games like minecraft and roblox that has you build things from scratch, but to me, its either not realistic or too cartoonish, or even takes too long to build. In this game, it truly takes city building to a whole-nother level. from just a road to a few houses to a metropolis with hundreds of people living in it can be made in a matter of a few minutes to a few hours. This game is truly a game changer where you can make any city you want."
2515,I have nothing to complain about. I love this game. It beats any city builder game out there.

Game is refined, stable, and infinitely re-playable. After 60 hours of game-play I thought it was time to give a review. This game is absolutely worth the price - 10/10."

2523,"amazing

Here's a free downvote for your hard work."
2525,Good game. Can go on for ever.

2536,absolutely loving this game! yash!
2537,Nice and relaxing
2538,"amazing, all the freedom you need to build your own city in sandbox.
The missions are challenging but able to fullfill."
2539,"It's a great game, clearly I've played it a lot. As far as I know, it's the best detailed city-simulator out there, by quite a bit. Pick it up, pick up some of the DLC on sale. My personal major-DLC tier list is Mass Transit, Parklife, Green Cities, After Dark, Snowfall, then everything else. I haven't even gotten the AD or Snowfall myself yet, and I already know that Industries, Sunset Harbor, and Universities are probably not for me. 

Paradox irritates with their decision to include a completely pointless stand-alone launcher. I guess maybe they have ambitions of being a platform of their own or something, but it's a useless waste of time, as is the pushing me to get some kind of account just with them (do they understand part of the appeal of Steam is so that I don't have to do that?). They/Colossal Order also left some pretty common infrastructure OUT OF the base game: any kind of bicycle transit, inland water treatment, prisons, zoned parks, 2-lane highways, recycling centers, trams, train ports, and zoned airports, etc... It doesn't FORCE you to buy DLC but it's still frustrating that they've handicapped the base game. For achievement hunters, they've tied a lot of the achievements to DLC so to 100% the game you're forced to buy it; another decision that feels... greasy.

All respect to the people who use this game in creative, infinite-money mode to minutely detail a diorama of a town or city with access to the extensive mods and the really incredible wealth of assets in the Steam Workshop. If you want to do that, this is 100% your game. Props to Paradox for sometimes taking Workshop content and giving creators a piece of the pie with Content Creator updates.

What *I* want is a little different: the inner workings and challenges of the simulated systems of a complex town or city. Cities:Skylines succeeds at a lot of this, with some glaring exceptions.

I wish the philosophy of the game were slightly different. I myself like the idea of a city-builder that can show both the downsides of crowded, polluted, poorly-working hives of scum and villainy AS WELL AS showing some Utopian visions, solutions, progressions toward different, better futures. The base mechanics chosen for this game are pretty car-centric, the Cims themselves don't have a sense of pushing back, there's very little acknowledgement of the push and pull of civic engagement, upset people pushing for or against change, coalitions, investment in neighborhoods; if you're familiar with NYC planning history, the analogy is it's too easy to be Robert Moses and little incentive to be Jane Jacobs. You can bulldoze a neighborhood that's been in the game for 100 years with very little consequence.

With that in mind, I think the things I miss the most are:
--Any kind of medium-density zoning
--Any kind of mixed-use zoning, with commercial and residential sharing building space
--Seasons
--Any progression of technology along a timeline
--More realistic scales of population to urban density (There are decent mods for this, however)
--A ""planning"" mode, where you can plan out districts, roads, setbacks, parks, and land use
--Civic, environmental, commercial and industrial groups that had their own agendas and consequences for not considering them
--Policies that made a little more sense from a real-city point of view

At this point I think it's more a wishlist for C:S 2 or some other successor but I just wanted to put this out there in the aether to get my thoughts in order.

2570,"Cities: Skylines is a really fun game where with a few mods, assets and DLCs, you can customise and build your city to the highest extent of any other city building games out there. Not too expensive, DLC are quite expensive though. Would definitely recommend."
2571,lyn2
2572,The game is ok but there's better options to spend your time. I wish that they had a beginner mode because there's a lot of things to keep track of in the game. You'll play it every 6 months for 5 hours then quit. I don't recommend getting it.
2573,"It is a great game and ive played it for years
Mod support is even better
"
2574,.
2575,I dont like the game because how many fucking dlcs it has. its like 30 dlcs. I want to download some good mods but i can't because i need dlc what are lke 15 dollars. Is these game made by EA.

2599,"I've played much more than 23 hours on another platform. However, Cities is by FAR my favorite city builder game. There's a good amount of depth, a great modding community, and so on. My only complaint is that with the amount of ""DLC"" out there, you can drop like $200 for all the content.  It may be worth it to you, but that's a bit rich to me for what most of that content amounts to in game. But, one could argue that for hundreds of hours of potential entertainment, it may be worth the cost."

2614,"Its a good game but in 2022 it feels very dated. Devs rely on the mod community to fix the problems with the game and most of the updates are DLCs that require you to pay . Its really harsh visually, and gameplay wise  an undo button will do wonders for the way you interact with the city."
2615,"It's a great game but: If you use mods, it will not work properly. I just played for about 2.5 hours and it crashed. No backup file. 2.5 hours gone forever. Otherwise I enjoy this game. Creativity doesn't stop anywhere (with mods)"

2655,"Cities Skylines fails miserably at what it sets out to do, but has a hidden strength that very few other games do.
It's a terrible city management game. Dogshit. Awful. Every essential part of a city's infrastructure is hidden behind arbitrary population headcounts, there are no options for proper mixed-use zoning, traffic control is pointless without mods (which only alleviate the problem), public transit requires a hefty DLC price tag instead of being something the game was built around, and there's no nuance whatsoever to local politics. Strikes and riots and protests are entirely absent, crime is a simple correlation between education and available jobs (which are two major contributing factors to crime, sure, but it's hardly just that), and there are no ways to control supply chains in the Industries DLC (also known as the State Capitalism DLC by people who like proper labels).

So what is it good at? Surprisingly, it's really good at showing how cities can evolve over time, how destructive highway- and car-centric policies are to communities, and why we have agencies like the EPA and OSHA in the real world. Of course, you need Road Anarchy and Prop Anarchy along with the endless font of incredible assets coming out of the community to make the city you're working on look nice (or if not ""nice,"" at least realistic), but it's kind of a given these days that modders do at least half the work of most developers.

Get it on sale if you want it, but don't expect it to be the answer to your city management sim prayers. If you were hoping to use this as a teaching or educational aid in any capacity, my suggestion is to just put the money toward the book [i]Confessions of a Recovering Engineer: Transportation for a Strong Town[/i] by Chuck Marohn and check out currently-existing Cities Skylines series on YT such as donoteat01's [i]Power, Planning, & Politics[/i] series."
2656,yes
2657,good game but i you need dlcs
2658,e
2659,"Awesome game, strongly recommend!"
2660,"I received this game for free at the Epic Store. But there is no mod support there. Mods make this game great. So I had to buy it here on Steam... well played GabeN, well played."
2661,"TO THE PORDUCER: DID YOU GUYS KNOW HOW WE CHINESE PLAYERS  CALL THIS GAME ? 

WE CALL IT :TRAFFIC-JAM SKYLINES!

COULD YOU PLEASE JUST DO SOMETHING ABOUT THE TRAFFIC SITUATION IN THIS GAME , I AM ABOUT TO REACH 80HOURS KNOW , AND I THINK I SPENT MORE THAN 85% OF MY TIME NOT FOCUSING ON BUILD MY CITY, BUT ON ENDLESS+VARIOUS+REPEATED TRAFFIC JAM ! BY LEARNING AND USING MODS LIKE TMPE !

THIS GAME  NOW SEEMS LIKE IT IS ALL ABOUT SOLVING  TRAFFIC JAM AND ARRANGING  CROSSROADS ONE BY ONE , NEVERTHELESS, TO REWARD ME WITH MY HARD WORK , IT BRINGS SOME OTHER MORE NEW TRAFFIC JAM APPEAR IN MY SIGHT!!! 

COME ON !  I STOPPED AT 40k POPULATION FOR 2 WEEKS NOW !!!  

I CANT SEE ANY POSSIBILITY TO MOVE FORWARD NOW CAUSE THOSE TRAFFIC PROBLEMS ARE  NOT ENDING !!

PLEASE UPDATE SOMETHING USEFUL!!

----
Never mind , I have found a way to kill traffic jam permanently.---Build a enclosed industry area."
2662,"I LOVE THIS GAME! It's like a game for either introverts or people who are bored. It's such a satisfying game, and i recommend you buy it now before it gets more expensive oh and the dlcs. If you like destroying things (satisfyingly) download the natural disaster dlc."
2663,its good ig
2664,"really fun game, however dlc practices are annoying"
2665,its good
2666,"I started playing this game again after a couple of years and I've already put in 10 hours over 2 days. 


This game is digital crack."
2667,"Game is a lot of meh. I guess if your passionate about city planning, this might be for you. I got bored of constantly having to build more roads and laying pipes to keep up with increasing population, it just got really tedious after a while. A copy-paste feature would have saved a lot of pain.

Playing this just made me want to play Roller Coaster Tycoon."
2668,"Sometimes the game can be glitchy, like when You upgrade roads and some sections suddenly don't connect anymore, the game also can be frustrating as it will tell you *what* is wrong but not really give any hint as to *why*, forcing you to look up videos or forum questions on the matter. Overall it's not a perfect game, but like most Paradox games I've played, fun to play. If you like building a simulated city and tending it like a bonsai tree, this is your game. 7/10"
2669,So I've given this game a good go. It's annoying at best. Why am I always running out of money for basic things? At least sim city was way more leniant with loans. Here: you can literally end up in a no win situation where you don't have a way to get a loan to make the emergency changes. What is up with that?
2670,"liked it a ton, only annoying thing is that you cant build small roads like bike roads instead of car roads for more bike oriented cities"
2671,"I have never built a city I feel like I would actually like to live in in Cities Skylines, and as someone who basically loves citybuilders for their toybox appeal, that is a problem for me. 

The game drags in its mid-late game when it principally becomes about solving traffic jams (or, worse-still, train-traffic-jams), but mostly it just makes me glad I live in Europe, where cities have more character, vim, history and originality than the tired districts that I plonk down hour after hour like some disengaged, capricious New World god. For gods' sakes, folks, build a communal garden (ideally without a parking lot) or a quaint pub in that space I leave between your Jacques-Tati-supermarket-become-flesh cul-de-sacs."
2672,it is amazing
2673,"You are an old man in the attic, working on his model railroad... but we call it Cities Skylines."
2674,"Best city simulator on the planet, i could easily put thousands of hours into the game if i had more storage because the amount of amazing and game changing mods on this game is insane."
2675,"Addictive Game <3 an Awesome game. if you like management games  , this one should be on the top of the list <3."
2676,its cool
2677,"building cities
"
2678,"Waste of time
10/10 would waste my time again"
2679,"The game has been nigh unplayable for me since the introduction of the Paradox Launcher. The launcher is poorly written. It has to be installed as administrator then the game has to be run as administrator for it to detect the launcher. If you install the launcher and then run the game as a different user, it does not see the launcher and thus refuses to start. Every other post in the support forums asks how to start the game without the launcher. Paradox should've done the smart thing and ditch the launcher instead. By introducing a launcher, Paradox broke the game completely. GG WP."
2680,"If you can tolerate poor performance and all the other jank that comes with Unity, this game is a lot of fun. Kudos to the modders - they really make the game what it is!"
2681,"Nice and relaxing. Basegame is pretty empty though, so DLC is a must. A lto of interresting mods and addons to the game on Steam Workshop."
2682,Solid game and mod friendly. Fun seeing a city develop over time. DLCs add more good stuff to the game but not needed. If you are into city builders get ready to spend hours and days playing this because there will always be something new to work on with every city you build.
2683,I made my city drink their own poo. I called my city [i]We Neeh to Poo[/i]! #EnvironmentalFriendly
2684,Amazing game with great content. Started playing on console then bought a pc when I saw you could expand by so much more. One of the best sim games out and only gets better with every dlc and asset that launches. Would highly recommend for anyone who wants an amazing challenge in city planning or any creative mind who would love to create as free as they want. Hop on and enjoy this amazing game you wont regret it.
2685,You can build the sewer system in a way that everyone showers in hot girl shit. My dream come true.
2686,"One of my favorite games, it's definitely the best game for designing and (re)creating cities! There are so many options, DLCs, and many assets from the workshop to try out. There are basically an infinite amount of possibilities!"
2687,"Jogo mal otimizado, o resto é ótimo.
Só dei que não recomendaria porque faz muito tempo que o jogo demora 500 anos para iniciar e desligar"
2688,Cities: Skylines is the gold standard bar-setter for City Building games.  It takes everything Sim City did then turns it to 11.  You'll easily squeeze 100+ hours out of this game.
2689,I really like the amount of freedom it gives you to build .and landscape
2690,Cool
2691,"This is definitely the next level of Sim City (old school) and a great play. I would love to see more ability to interact at the city level, but this game is excellent."

2693,gud
2694,"Fun game
I maxed out my city with 100k pop and 6 monuments

2696,Solid game
2697,A wonderful game to express ur ideas for a city and ur able to make any type of city you want!
2698,fun game to relax...
2699,"A quick story about how lovely this game can be:

It was a dark and stormy night in the small beach town of Hammerhead. A tropical storm lashed the city, with the storm surge leaping over the beach, crashing into the pastel houses on the overdeveloped beachfront. Thunder lit trees and buildings on fire. The local beach volleyball courts were empty. Everyone had left. Except for one woman: Linda Graham. Linda had one goal, and one goal only: To play beach volleyball.

Out at sea, a huge wave began to form. It headed towards the thin barrier island that hosted Hammerhead. The wave threatened to sweep away anything not tied down. Especially 2016 Nissan Rogues that were driving down empty streets looking for a nearby beach volleyball court.

Linda cringed as a fierce bolt of lightning shattered the air, setting the local shopping outlets on fire. Linda began to doubt herself. Was this all worth it? Was it worth risking her life to pound a volleyball with her fists over a net at high speeds within a certain square so she could get one point that very well didn't matter in the grand scheme of things? OF COURSE! Linda chuckled at her own stupidity. OF COURSE it was worth it! It was beach volleyball or death! She pressed on, pushing the pedal to the metal.

The wave finally reached Hammerhead. It was smaller now, but still just as deadly. The wave smashed into the local car wash with staggering force, destroying it, as well as the car wash's supply of the rainbow colored soap that little kids always beg their parents to pay the extra 5 dollars for. The wave continued. So did Linda. Both wouldn't stop for anything. Both pressed onward. Linda could've turned back. She could've saved herself...

Instead, in typical video game NPC fashion, she drove the 2016 Rogue straight into the wave. Great job Linda. Maybe next time play normal volleyball at an indoor court. At least there are no freak waves there.

Moral of the Story:
1) Buy this game, because you can never run out of things to do.
2) Don't be like Linda. If you see a massive wave, do not drive into it. Your life is more important than beach volleyball.

This concludes my review. I spent way too much time on it, so I'm going to go touch grass."
2700,very good game
2701,You can destroy homes of angry people
2702,"Cities: Skylines has its pros and cons, but overall, I would definitely recommend it. Let's look at whether it's for you or not.

Pros: 
Cities: Skylines is a great game to manage and build the city of your dreams. You can build a ""sandbox"" city (Unlimited resources, money, and all milestones unlocked), or try to make one with unlimited money but still have milestones, or make a proper city, managing the economy and population. The possibilities are endless!
With Steam, mod integration is seamless, especially with the workshop. With some mods, making a proper downtown full of unique buildings rather than the normal box-type assets becomes possible! This makes your city much nicer to look at, especially since you can put high-rise bans on all the suburban neighbourhoods.
Parks are great, policies are amazing, public transport has many options. 
I can get lost in building my city, and frankly, on flights, it's all I do. The optimisation is great, so newer MacBook Airs and probably any new Windows computer shouldn't be having trouble running it. 

Cons:
I did say mod integration is great, but the management of the mods, not so much. It's a pain to manage mods, especially groups of them, since Cities: Skylines is a heavily moddable game. Whenever I try to delete sets of mods, I have to scroll through every single mod to see which ones actually relate to the parent mod and which ones don't. This isn't really a con, just something that gets me frustrated. Folders would be great.
DLCs can be disappointing. Apart from Mass Transit, I can't say any are really worth getting unless in bundles or huge sales.
The game itself can get repetitive. Though you can try different maps and different scenarios, it is essentially the same thing. There isn't really anything the developers can do about this, it's just what happens with games like these. 
Be very careful when downloading mods. Some can cause corruption if used on older cities. Believe me, I've lost a few."
2703,Yes. . .
2704,Excellent City Building game. Just like in real life.
2705,"Great game, hope they come out with a second instalment soon"
2706,"A premium game experience for only $200. What a deal. It's okay though, because a coincidence of genre can potentially lead to 100s of hours of gameplay."
2707,100% recommended. Using mods is the way to go
2708,Without dlc or mods it's boring
2709,good
2710,Best city builder and traffic simulator ever :P

2717,Great game some DLCs are defenitly worth it
2718,great game to chill with
2719,"This is a great city manager game. But you'll see many play it as a traffic manager. Some design choices, game-play aspects, and complexity make this frustrating for beginners and without mods. Otherwise, it's a powerful game that allows skilled players to make some really nice cities. I thought it was great, putting 50 hours into a city without any DLC or mods."

"
2721,Very fun game
2722,Very fun and interactive city building games. Gives the brain a real workout by utilizing the minds strategic and logical mindset. Packs boatloads of fun as you manage services and road networks as you watch the city develop with miles of population.

The graphics are really nice and all the game mechanics are unique and fresh from all the other city building games. Its very rewarding to see your city grow, expanding roads and buildings. In my opinion one of if not the best game in this category. 9/10"

Don't get me wrong, this made the game a lot more customisable and gave access to a lot more tools, the possibilities are endless, but it has gotten to the point where I needed to make a choice - remove some mods or buy more ram.

2774,"Even after 7 years, this is still the best city builder for the modern aesthetics."
2775,"Cities Skylines is not a game - it's a way of life.Learning curve is immense and the game is not very forgiving to noob mistakes. You have to be an expert in many areas at same time, with mods that will solve game limitations and you better find a map that is very plane, or else you'll spend ages learning how to flat the terrain so you can build a train junction. It's frustrating and you spend more time watching videos than playing. I might came back to the game when I retire, though."
2776,"My favorite city builder. I've played every builder out there at one point or another and this one is my favorite. originally bought it somewhere else, but I wanted to have the Steam Workshop custom content because it makes it so much better. If you are a city builder fan and haven't played it you should really pick it up. I hope that there is a Cities Skylines 2 in the works soon."

i have been playing this game for a while and only a few small issues which were easily fixed. i like that mod access is very available and easy (i really don't know if that is proper english but you know what i mean) and there are some brilliant mods out there on the workshop. i have bought 2 dlc's and both of them shocked me with how good they are. Out of all the games i have on steam and on my computer even this one has never failed to make me bored. i have recently past 100 hours on this game and i actually have only been playing for 2-3 months. If you into peaceful games that you are happy to grind for hours on then this would be my first recommendation."

2789,What Sim City 5 should have been.
2790,"Its fun, but if you add the mods it can become pretty dang unstable."
2791,"Completely absorbing game, chock full of detail and challenge!"
2792,"This game is amazing! I wish I could express in words how awesome. Most games get my heart rate up and are so fast paced. This allowed me to dumb out and just create new things. If its vanilla and completing the challenges or using mods to make crazy fun cities. 

Every update is pretty good so far and brings new challenges that will keep you very busy. 

If you are looking for a game to relax and enjoy with a great design aspect then this is it."
2793,"Really addicting, this replaced FIFA for me, good thing it's not a shit money grab like EA. I'd say this is worth it if you get it on sale but even if you don't it's still really good, this is an really well made game which is actually rare these days, respect to the devs."
2794,Cultivate the lives of people with expansive agency.
2795,"It is very fun when you actually know what you are doing.
PLAN ACCORDINGLY!"
2796,"First you have to read multiple massive walls of text and agree to contracts and agree to be tracked and examined and recorded, then after you finally get the game running there is an annoying ding every 10 seconds or so with another wall of text. I tried to play because a guy on YouTube made it seem relaxing but 10 min in the game I was already done, can't deal with all that spam. If I wanted to deal with emails and messages I would do work. When I play games I would like to be left to actually play the game."
2797,At least here I can have walkable cities...
2798,"you should buy this game
or don't
or do
its pretty cool man"
2799,awsome

2808,"Fun City-building game. It does take a lot of work to create a city that follows a neatly arranged grid and infrastructure. I personally have not reached a very high number of population, but this game allows you to create your city following your creativity."
2809,very fun
2810,"I am addicted to this game like it's crack. I used to play constantly on my PlayStation when it went free. Now I've come to PC.

The game has a huge learning curve for new people, but if you just sit down and play for awhile you'll get used to it. Then once you've really gotten into the game you can start looking up guides and tips and there's like a whole new layer of complexity to the game.
As long as you're into micromanaging and taking your time, this game is for you. It feeds my OCD so good."
2811,"The best city building game by far.  The biggest mistake that the user can make is to get every mod and asset out there.  Just realize that the heavy work load may crash your system (as it has done for me).  If you build your city up slowly and methodically (and watching lots of helpful tutorials), you will have a very descent city.  Don't try to put everything into one city when you can make multiple cities, each one a little different from the other.  Totally addictive and believe me, it'll haunt you into playing very often !
"
2812,"Love how challenging this game can get and the amount of detail that comes with the mechanics of the game, even in vanilla."
2813,"I missed my calling.  I should have been a city planner.   I used to play SimCity, but this is much better."
2814,"Its a fun game, but I do experiece quite a bit of bugs. But other wise its a really fun game with a lot of brain thinking and lots of fun. Also I would like more things like maybe car accidents or stuff like that just to make the game more interesting."
2815,"The evolutionary successor to SimCity 4. Cities Skylines has long since exceeded SC4 did, both in terms of the base game+expansions and in terms of the mod community's creativity. This is a throwback to the great builder games of the 90s where you could get lost for days just creating. All the expansions and mods have started to really wear on the game engine a bit (I'm getting slowdowns and processing problems now more than I ever used to), but I still play this game regularly, and I would immediately purchase a sequel if it ever got made."
2816,Yes
2817,"when the building is tall :)
"
2818,fun and barely any action
2819,"Very fun game, I would def recommend it if you are interested in such sandbox, city-building game"
2820,Cities Skylines is an enjoyable city management and builder game. mods elevate the game greatly and sadly much of the game is gutted without the very expensive DLC (I would look elsewhere to purchase). If you enjoy city management with minor micro management then I confidently recommend this game.
2821,Just an amazing game
2822,i tried to fix a traffic issue and the power went out and half the city got abandoned and it took me 4 hours to fix
2823,If you want a city builder I couldn't recommend any other game. This game is as realistic as you want it. Any play style will give you a city.
2824,"Not for me.  No preamble, no historical context, no goals, no explanation of what the game is about before starting.  Just get on the bulldozer and start building roads.  Thought and hoped they would do better by now.  Would not consider this an improvement on SimCity which I have not played in over a decade.

It appear to be be a tool to teach you to push buttons until you do what they want you to do.

Did not even start the bulldozer."
2825,Best City Building Game EVER!!
2826,"i love this game. there are plenty great mods to help make the game more fun or more realistic, it's also very time consuming and addictive."
2827,"fun game, probably the most robust city builder out there. can be pure hell sometimes but it's addicting nonetheless."

2834,"After playing this game for 70 hours I think it's time to write a review

Pros:
stunning landscape
realistic cities/gameplay
Large Modding community*
many DLCs

Cons:
Game without mods is far too car heavy
Too many DLCs for too high a price
gameplay not explained when you first start
traffic is almost unmanageable without mods

Overall I really like cities:Skylines It's a game I can see myself coming back to for years to come. There are no other games in the city building genre like it, Building perfectly straight roads and seeing cars smoothly flow down them is oddly satisfying but frustrating when traffic builds up. If you are looking for a new game to play definitely give this one a try.

*Mods are a huge part of this game with many being needed for smooth gameplay and to make your city run smoothly.


"
2835,When I went to go onto the game it didn't show. I've asked for a refund. Couldn't find anything to solve it. I DO NOT RECOMMEND
2836,"Long-standing king of the city-builders, for better or worse.

Yes, it's a flawed experience in many ways. The simulation and scale are painfully unrealistic, which can make planning quite unintuitive. Additionally, the gameplay focuses a LOT on traffic, so expect to spend most of your time laying and moving roads.

However, with a few mods, this game can be an extremely satisfying and creative toy. Check the essential mod list on /r/citiesskylines. If you're willing to put in the time customizing your experience, I can safely recommend 100%.

In my opinion, there simply isn't a better city-builder out right now. That's really a condemnation of the genre moreso than a compliment for this product, but it is what it is."
2837,"Great citybuilder letting you go crazy and create a city as beautiful as you want, even if it is a bit complicated. 
There is a lot of DLC which i don't really like, but if you get them on discounts they add a great deal of content to the game at a good price."
2838,"for some reason the mod thats conflicting with another mod doesnt exist on my computer, 10/10 if you want to get pissed at long loading times and your 300k pop city being so laggy you cant play it"
2839,I truly suggest Cities: Skylines! So much perfection here that quenches my creative thirst!

2847,it is very realistic

2853,very good very nice
2854,number one citizen cruelty simulator
2855,"I'm not going to lie. I have a definite love/hate relationship with this game. This is the best city builder sim out there so far. It has a large number of mod and asset creators as well. All that said, it's still very much just a game, and by that, I mean it doesn't even try to be realistic... at all. And if you try to make it realistic, you can get close, but never close enough really, and if you are OCD, like me, playing this game can become more of an exercise in frustration than a pleasant interlude. One of the biggest reasons for that is that it is addictive and time FLIES by at warp speed! 

Oh, and don't get me started on the absurd annoyance regarding the Xbox version of the game not actually able to do even a fraction of what the PC version can. Luckily, I had the opportunity to build a high end gaming rig (not that this game needs that kind of power at all, though it is a RAM hog, for sure), but still."

2861,A lovely game
2862,Its a really good and addicting game i started playing it and couldn't stop playing. cities skyline is worth buying if u like city building games
2863,Almost 100 hours of playing this game and I still broke my traffic and start new city again.
2864,"I am not a 45 yo father, probably not one of the oldest people playing this game. I am not a single father to my yet non existant Son, who is not 14 now. My maybe soon to be son got this game for Christmas from his yet non existant uncle, so we didn't install it on his computer and he didn't start playing. By the end of the week he had 24 hours on this game, sikes. This was horrible for me, as it was already hard for me to find ways to spend time with my son, as he doesn't exist yet. So i decided to make a Steam account and get this game to see if I could maybe play alongside him. loaded into the game, made my character and world and started playing but I was stuck on what you where supposed to do. I asked my Son for help and he hosted a game for me to join. loved it as it was the best time had spent with my Son since my imaginary wife had died from non existance. This game has ever since brought me and my son closer again and now we actually spend time together outside the house together as well. This game reminded me that there's fun to be had in everything, and it has brought both me and my Son many happy memories, that i imagined. 

If you see a comment like this on other games, dont give the reviwer anything. Its just copy paste mafia for steam points.

2868,"Hours of fun if you like city builders, and so many ways to play. The vanilla game is great, but mods add so many little ways to finetune your gameplay. Truly a game that has something for everyone - scenarios are great if you don't like starting from scratch too!"
2869,"If you like to design a city and make it to your ideas or dreams,or either you want to create a prosperous city or for the challenge of it,then yes this game is for you."
2870,"The Game is very easy to get a hang of once you play for a couple hours or create your first test city. The workshop is a really friendly and helpful place as well. You can download mods and assets that help enhance your game to a great level. 
I would only say that you need a good computer/PC else the game gets laggy very quickly. 

Overall, very good game and recommend to everybody."

2900,I play this game because I have no friend
2901,"Well, 200+ hours in this game and here we are.

The base game is very bare, but after buying most DLC and content creator packs it gets very fun. The workshop is filled with interesting content that I use.

This game gets you to make your own city as well as many things city-related such as bus lines, policies and Metro lines.

What I find best: I find the public transport aspect of this game very good. It allows for many possibilities. The only issue is that occasionally this does suggest absurd routes between two Bus stops.
What I find worst: This does require a beefy PC. Even with a 1050Ti and 16 RAM, this does lag and crash (especially with extra content, DLCs and mods). 

Overall, this would be one of my favourite game."
2902,"this game is really good for anyone who likes design, it has a nice range of styles and additonal packs arent expensive :)"
2903,i really like the fact that you can build your own city and make money whit the dlc
2904,I have many problems with the launcher. I've tried many things but nothing works. It's a shame because the game is fun. But a game that doesn't start isn't worth buying. A waste of money sadly.

Buying this game can be a real gamble depending on the configuration of your computer,.. among other possible factors. Would I still recommend this game?

2927,"Cities Skylines is a very nice game to play when you have some time to spare. It brings out your creative process, and it always makes you think of new ways to improve your city. A downside is that if you don't have DLCs, the game is quite plain, and the maps are pretty standard. I would recommend to buy this game with 2 or 3 additional DLCs, to make the game as a whole more interesting. 
I hope you found this helpful!"

"
2944,"I've put in 374 delightful hours into this game SO FAR. It's inspired me to view cities in a 'new light'. 

This game felt challenging at the beginning because there is a lot to manage as a city planner. I have grown to love managing cities, developing neighborhoods, and designing street patterns. Overall, as a creative person I have enjoyed the creative freedom and limitless possibility of city building. I love adding details and beautifying my cities. 

If any of those things sounds interesting to you, I HIGHLY recommend the game. If that does not sound up your speed, no worries there are many elements in this game that keep you coming back for more."
2945,"I just love the intricacies and the level of detail, along with the fact the player must plan ahead in order to grow and develop a profitable city. Even though, by all means, it's not perfect, it's one of the most enjoyable games one could play."

Absolute recommend! Thumbs up all the way. 


And remember:
Never...buy...full...price. ;)
You're welcome."

2969,"Definitely the best city-builder I've every played. There are a lot of details and things to do or extra challenges to the game. There are a lot of DLCs but none of them are required, they only add extra features or challenges, and are worth it if you buy them on sale. The game is modable so you can customize how you like it, though a lot of mods don't work.
There are quite a few glitches, and 90% of the DLCs shouldn't be bought unless their on sale, but the game itself from stability to the game play is very good and enjoyable."
2970,Good game because there is a lot of stuff what you can build and yeah.
2971,Game is way to hard played for 30 hours straight couldn't get a working city awalys something to do with money dead bodies etc. DO NOT BUY ALSO IM NOT A TROLL I ACTUALLY TREID

2976,"its very entertaining watching your city grow, from a small town to a paradise. its not all about making your city bigger you have to keep in mind about the water supply and electricity. you also need to entertain your citizens with parks nature resorts and much more. over all i recommend this for people who like games where you build up your own world and customise it to how you like it, it can get addictive fast as there's loads to do and not specifically aimed on one thing like most games are. i enjoy this game very much and you will to."

2984,"Best city building game ever, love it"
2985,aaa
2986,Great game. Don't look here JUST buy it.
2987,"I bought the game a few hours ago, spent the following hours trying everything i could to make this game work. I triple checked that my specs lined up too. It seems like even older players are having issue with launching the game. I'd rather not buy a game if i can't be certain it will always launch. 

It's a shame since i was super excited to try this game, but when you're not even certain it will even launch.. whats the point?"
2988,"Not even close to 20 year old sim city.  Hydro-electric plant was offline as soon as I built it, no water or something.... no hints from the game as to what happened. Roads are near impossible, you can't build interchanges in existing highways.  The base game is totally lame, the 3/4 view is boring, and difficult to navigate.  There is no grid aside from roads next to each other, which always seem to be at an angle.... Music is ""not able to be streamed due to licensing"".  Rip off of a great, but dated game.  NOT ANY IMPROVEMENT.  Positive reviews are all smoke and mirrors.
"
2989,"A high quality spiritual successor to simcity with a heavier focus of traffic managament

2991,Great game if you enjoy pretending that you are better than your municipal city planners.
2992,Like the old Sim City but loads better
2993,Easy to get into.  Gets more complex as you do more and are more successful at managing the city.
2994,fun
2995,incredible game I can raise taxes to an absurd amount and laugh while the people of my town drink shit water
2996,Yes.
2997,"Cities: Skylines is probably the most addicting game in my library. Very few games have consumed me like this one has, with every little intricacy of designing cities offering endless hours of content to enjoy not just playing, but thinking about after the fact. The world is in fact your oyster in Cities: Skylines, and you're given every single tool possible. If you get bitten, you will find yourself spending 30 minutes trying to figure out the best way to format your intersection to reduce traffic, you will demolish neighborhoods just to move them over a few blocks to fit your city. Everything this game has to offer is incredible, and offers a canvas for your expression. The one drawback is that there is a significant amount of DLC that locks a lot of these great mechanics behind a paywall which is unfortunate. If I had to suggest 3 of them to get, it would be Green Cities, Parklife, and After Dark(for the Bike Infrastructure)

If you're looking for a game to absolutely sink your teeth into, with a big but rewarding learning curve, this is the game for you. If you don't have a ton of time to learn about city design and all the details about this game, perhaps you may want to pass, but still receives my full recommendation."
2998,I allowed one block to catch Covid and now my entire city is dead.
2999,"Did I almost kill my PC several times with the inordinate amount of mods and assets I got for this game? Yes. Will I do it again? Also yes. Don't get me wrong, the vanilla game (no DLCs/ mods/ custom assets) is pretty fun. But once you add those things, it's a whole different level. Undoubtedly the best city building sim in existence as of this review."
3000,Over 400 hours played this game is awesome.
3001,"Therapeutic. Might need some DLC to fully enjoy it
"
3002,yes
3003,"One of my more favorite go tos.  When I'm tired of everything else, there is always this.  I don't own many of the DLCs but I like the base game well enough.  Mostly, I just like creating convoluted roadways and railways."
3004,yes
3005,What a fun and creative game! I have also learned a lot about real world city design and understand my surroundings a lot more because of this. Hooray!

                                                                              5/5 Stars"

10/10, would recommended"
3030,A great game which allows you to carefully create an environment where you can mistreat the workers in the city and then destroy their lives with a series of meteor strikes. This gets my highest rating of tsunami/3460 ruined lives.
3031,"Great game, however if you plan to go big, game needs some mods, especially around traffic. Recommend when you start to play straight away go with traffic mods at least. Do not underestimate traffic and try to plan ahead. Also, citizens like to walk much more than in real life, path walks and cross walks will save you lot of cars on the roads.
 
Wait for sales or bundles, they are quite often and check on youtube which DLCs to buy, since some are really not worth the price.

Overall: Recommend buying on sale and play with at least traffic mod."
3032,very addicting game i like it because i dont like how cities in the real world are designed but this game makes me realize how hard it is to design a really good city

3035,There is so much you can do in this game and you truly have the ability to make your dream city. I highly recommend this game. I also like when they big ball crashes into buildings and such.

3062,"This game is good on its own, but with the use of mods and the DLC available, this game turns into one of the most addicting builder/planning games out there."
3063,"I really love this game. I played SimCity when I was much younger. This game has really satisfied that itch entirely. The DLCs I've slowly accumulated. If you're really into simulation-esque city building type games -- this game hits it. At the time of writing this I am currently at 270, it will most certainly continue to accrue. I tend to play it once a year for a week or so in a new city."
3064,"Even if you do buy the 30+ DLC's this is still unplayable, stats are either lacking or in total, not per capita, so those are useless.  Cash flow fluctuates randomly, and there are not detailed enough controls or even numbers on the budget to be of any use at all.  Placing roads is basically if the game feels like it, can't connect them, just delete them and try 5 more times and maybe it will work.  Almost always have to delete and replace highways to place underpasses, and when replacing them often have to do in sections, because the game is too stupid to adjust the supports for them.  Also, cannot place roads across other roads, so making a grid takes forever as you have to click at each intersection.  I could go on, possibly forever."
3065,yes
3066,"So, I tried to build the utopia known as 'Wakanda'.

It started off alright, then factories struggled to get any workers... then, the commercial places too. High schools are at less than half capacity and I ended up deleting the college/university because nobody could teach. At this point I thought this is gonna be impossible so just cheat money. I built parks, infrastructure, and plenty of health services (which treated all for free), I built fire and then...
I built police....
I found what I thought was an impossible stat, ""crime rate: 600%+"" so that means almost all of my population are committing crime?! Then what finally ruined the city is when an officer returned fire on an [un]armed suspect, a good boy dat din do nutheeeng so citizens gathered peacefully burning buildings desperately seekingh warmth and taking the contents within to keep them safe"

3081,"Been playing this masterpiece of a game since 2017 if I'm not mistaken and it truly is the greatest city building sim ever made. As you start playing with mods, the game only gets more and more interesting, and more and more complex. I'd definitely recommend this to anyone, and I hope CO comes out with its own The Sims type simulator someday too."
3082,"The interface is fairly confusing, there's lot of layered popups in your face, the DLC is poorly explained but it's a really fun game despite all that."

3088,"it took me 2 seconds to be 500K in debt
very realistic"
3089,"It's a good game it's the best city sim/building game I've played to date. But I think this game is kinda boring (not rly that boring but a bit) without the purchase of DLCs or something else. I really want the mass transit DLC and industries but some real life things has restricted me from getting it and also restricted me from making my city to the best of my ability. Overall, I would definitely recommend this game but just be prepared to pay for DLCs."

3101,"Absolutely love this game, in my opinion it is one of if not the best city builder that most people can play. This game is limited by the technology of its time, and has a few bugs, glitches, and annoyances which can be extensively fixed and expanded upon through mods. My only gripes with the game are its hard limits to city size in late game, as well as the ridiculous amount of paid DLC that Paradox loves to release"

3130,a fun take on the sim city formula
3131,One of the only games where I can become a ruthless dictator! Love it!
3132,"So erm, yeah, after 2.5k hours I can say this is quite a good game!

TL;DR: If you're new to the game, take it slow and get some context as you go, don't rush it! After a while you'll come to appreciate the awesome modding community with tonnes of content extending the gameplay, but ye be warned that your RAM/CPU might be screaming at you once you get hooked on workshop content. 
(And you might spend hours looking at people just going about their business. Modded version of this game can be basically a souped-up diorama or a model trainset, but much more interactive!)


Anyways, for the full review:
This game allows you to design whatever cities you like, and going back through older saves I can definitely see how my strategies have changed from a high-rise blobbing without too much worry to more sprawling mid density cities. Personally I have come to like the ""build your own working model of a city"" approach rather than the ""make money and spend it on flashy stuff"". 

The great thing about this game is the extensibility and replay-ability. 
Bored with seeing high rises everywhere? Start a new city where you'll have small villages and farms.
Bored of small villages and farms? Start a new city strewn between a string of islands and heavily dependent on fishing industry.

And if you run out of things to challenge you just enter the world of [i]mods and other workshop content[/i].
I honestly think that the game would be long gone for me by now if it weren't for the great modding community. The amount of new gameplay mechanics that can be introduced by mods alone is staggering, and at this point the heavily-modded version I'm running feels like Cities Skylines 2 alpha, as some of the mods will challenge you in quite different ways that will change designs of your cities significantly. 

The largest and most impactful mods ones are probably these:
[list]
    [*] [b]TM:PE (Traffic Manager President Edition)[/b] - allow you to perform traffic magic. Also let's you disable the ""pocket cars"" mechanics and de-spawning of cars. That means you can have actual gridlocks in your city and you'll need to learn to efficiently plan transit networks. 
    [*][b]Real Time[/b]: This is a mod that completely changes the time progression and behaviour of citizens. You'll actually have to deal with rush hours, events, weekends, etc. Pair that with TM:PE that disallows spawning and you'll have fun trying to transport [i]most[/i] of your workers to their workplace by 9am. Oh and rush hour of bicycling students never gets old - if you think that ""match day event"" of a few hundred people coming to see football is a lot of traffic just imagine what happens when 12k students need to get to a single university building [b]each morning[/b]. This mod really forces you to think in terms of most efficient transport solutions, and it will punish you hard if you don't your citizens needs into account. Great new layer of complexity that frankly should be in the main game.
    [*][b]81 tiles[/b]: Well, now you have the whole map to play with!
    [*][b]More Vehicles[/b]: Now that you have rush hours and all that space, it's good to have more available vehicles. Weirdly enough this is not to allow more cars, but to allow service vehicles and transport vehicles to spawn. They are all tied to cars limit, and that places a definite cap on how much you can grow, and this mod raises the city size ceiling quite significantly, particularly if your cars [i]don't de-spawn[/i]. And if you decide to go for a more car-centric design you have 4x the number vehicles to play with!
[/list]

And there are of course loads of other mods that help you build stuff easier/better (Road Anarchy, Quay Anarchy, Move It, Find It, Intersection Marking Tool, Precision Engineering, Node Controller - to name a few) and heaps of content that will add nice quality of life improvements. There are heaps of articles and guides pointing you to these mods, but unlike the ones in the list these are more visual / quality of life rather than ""this will change the gameplay drastically"". Although, of course, if I were to take them out of the activated mod list the game would feel like it's missing something.

And yeah, make sure that you have all the RAM you can get. This is genuinely the only game which has driven my RAM upgrade needs. I have recently updated from 32GB to 64GB as I was [i]swapping to disk[/i] when playing. All those workshop items do stack up quite significantly!

And lastly, as much as it pains me to say, don't buy every DLC. If you're just starting out take it slow with the base game and add things when you've built a whole city - at least it was fun when new DLCs were coming out and I could start new cities specifically with the new content added, e.g. Night Life districts. 
Kinda the same chat with mods/workshop content - take them slowly one by one and see what you like. No need to burst in with 100+ mods, it will likely sap away quite a lot of the enthusiasm: as mentioned above, some mods do change the game logic and complexity quite significantly, so if you try to handle more realistic traffic on a larger map before you've grown accustomed to it you might have a bad time. Just treat these mods as DLCs: one at a time, and a new city to try them out; this is also because once you add new content or change the gameplay mechanics your existing infrastructure is quite likely to crumble as it was built with different gameplay rules!"
3133,would recommend if you have 64 gigs of ram atleast :)
3134,"If you like old school SimCity, then you would love this"
3135,This game is very fun but suprisingly challenging
3136,weirdly addictive
3137,funny nut city
3138,Playing cities skylines enough will make you utterly disappointed with North American urban design
3139,"It took me a while to get the hang of it, but it brings back memories of Sim City, it is just more complex, but worth the time investment to learn it."
3140,ME GOD YEEETTTTTT
3141,"For a city building game, it is absolutely fantastic. You can consider it to be the king of this genre as it combines building and managing a city very well. It is very easy to understand what is going on, made more intuitive by the popups throughout the experience. This game is not without its flaws and there are two major ones, optimisation and the sheer amount of DLCs. First of all, you need a mod for the game to use the processing power of your pc, otherwise, your gpu and cpu will be at five percent and your game will be running at ten FPS. Then, there is the amount of optional content adding major features to the game, For example, the after dark DLC, which adds cyclism as a way of transport and the tourism industry, which should be part of the base game. Speaking of it, it is quite dull due to the lack of variety in many areas, and the fact that you cannot buy the whole map, options for public transport are quite limited and (if you want to play vanilla) the map selection is not the greatest"

3167,"I've had this game for years and I am totally done.

 I understand that 3rd party mods come with risks and that the hosting company isn't necessarily responsible when the game stops working because comparability issues.  But fucking come on.  This game was designed to incorporate custom assets from the start and I have only used steam supported assets.  I was 1200 hours in a city and because some stupid asset was no longer compatible after an update I no longer can play that city ever again.  Are you fucking kidding me.  I have tried every goddamn thing to play my saved game; nothing works.  And even when I start up a fresh map, I get a fuck-ton of stupid errors that the game can't identify properly.  

Fuck this game. I am so fucking pissed."
3168,"New to the game, better than SimCity the reviews don't lie..."
3169,"Really good game, a bit hard to figure it out in the beginning but really enjoyable on the long run."
3170,it was fun to create my own cities the way i wanted them built. And with the DLCs it was also fun to blow them up . . . Highly recomended! DLCs are all good.

3179,"Very fun game, it will consume you."
3180,"you ever played sim city? 
Well this is sim city done so much better
you need DLC though to play the game more then 60 hours"
3181,"fun
"
3182,Great game! A little bit of a learning curve in the beginning as far as navigation with the menus and warning notifications from the city residents.
3183,This game is on a whole other level.  I grew up with Sim City.  City Skylines takes the city management experience to a whole new level.
3184,"My cities always look like sh!t, and there's A LOT of paid dlc but the game is chill"
3185,fghdhjufgfghjhfg
3186,"If you love infrastructure and being able to completely manage a city, this games for you."
3187,"i made all the sewage flow into a resevoir but it overflowed and flooded the downtown core with poo

haha downtown poo street am i right"
3188,good game
3189,"Love the ability to make and create a city the way I please. I enjoyed the challenge of trying to balance out all of the needs that my city had. However, I found that it's more fun to design metropolises and see if they can support themselves as you flood the city with new residents. Tons of mod support that makes the game even more fun once it gets boring for the first, or maybe even hundredth time. I couldn't say enough about how much I enjoy this game without sacrificing any other part of my life."
3190,Best answer to Sim City
3191,"very enjoyable game but defo buy game passes
mass transit
maybe park life
industries if your properly commited
and GET MODS!!!"
3192,"Amazing game. Easy to play....and as your city expands it gets complicated.
some DLC are not worth it. Just get the starter bundle and do your research on what other DLCs you want.
Airport DLC is cool, but not worth it. You probably will build one or two. I'm Ok with the generic airport the game comes with.

"
3193,"Paradox decided to release the unfinished parts of the game as dlc, so that kinda sucks. Either way though, it still an enjoyable game without them and even without mods. 7/10. Would exploit citizens again. : ^ )"
3194,GG
3195,lol
3196,very noice
3197,Good game for design and building of city. Like the way it is setup and functions. The graphics are not great but this also helps the running of the game without deep load on PC.

3201,good city builder
3202,Everything!
3203,"really fun when it works, but this bitchass game be crashing all the damn time on the long ass loading screen, anyways lets just say this game inhales RAM and it dont help with broken mods"
3204,Best city builder ever made
3205,if you like city builders this is without a doubt the best one.
3206,(Y)
3207,city design and twitter bots
3208,Blaming the city? Wait till you play this to know the reality
3209,"Un gran juego que requiere pasciencia y aprender como funciona
"
3210,Good for people who like building
3211,"fun, calming, nice planeation, sadly seems like you need  [spoiler] not paradox launching tool [/spoiler] to even launch the game"
3212,"Best City Builder game, ever."
3213,"I got this game for 5 bucks in a sale because heck why not. I hate money. And then I played it. Oh. My. Gosh. City skylines is one of those games that can be as simple or as complicated as you want it to be. If you want to come home from work and just watch your city grow with little to no input, you can do it(you just have to overbuild stuff like water and electricity). If you want to wrack your brain and customize individual traffic lights to create optimal traffic flow, you can. The choice is yours. I've been playing cities for several months now and it never gets old. Each dlc adds something totally new to work on. (The dlc is so worth it, unlike some other games.) So yeah, get it. Especially right now. All you've got to lose is 5 bucks and you've got the world to gain."
3214,bad game :/
3215,...
3216,
3217,how can the airport expansion cost more than the base game it makes no sense???
3218,very good
3219,"Great city builder, easy to lose hours in. DLC content as 400 releases is annoying"
3220,"Really good game.
"
3221,"Base game feels extremely bare without DLCs. Basically imagine wanting to build the city of your dreams, but ultimately be locked behind a paywall that stops you dead in your tracks from being able to aspire to big goals. Furthermore, half of the other DLCs are just radio packs that add nothing but clutter on your storage and a sense of dread that you could've just heard everything on YouTube or Spotify. If ANY paradox developer is seeing this, for the love of god talk to your HR team about releasing good public updates without putting everything behind 15-20 dollar paywalls to add better systems to your own base game.

TL;DR Base game is bare without 15-20 dollar DLCs, and Half of the DLCs are radio packs that clutter your storage.

Don't buy this unless you want to suffer for not having money to buy nearly essential updates to your game."
3222,"I lose my life in this game, with a HUGE community workshop, no two cities are ever the same."
3223,.
3224,Its a Good game i just didnt like it
3225,you build cities
3226,Great game tons of hours will be taken away playing this game
3227,Get lost for hours in pure creativity.
3228,"This Game is the best city building game ever! theres so many mods, infinite cash mode, and just overall so many possible citys! 10/10
"
3229,great game!
3230,This game is an amazing game and i've always loved it! Such a good sandbox game!
3231,"Definitely a fun game, I keep losing money but the game is about learning how to overcome those difficulties, its nice to do in free time though"
3232,"Best cities building game, very addictive and can use a lot of mods to customize your cities in your own way but one problem for me is it uses a lot of RAM. If you want all effective and useful mods and a lot of goods assets, 32gb ram is recommended."
3233,This is easily the greatest city building simulator out there. 100% recommend.
3234,This is such a good clean City builder and there is so much you can do.
3235,"fun game
"
3236,great game!
3237,It's awesome!
3238,This has to be one of the best city builders I have ever seen. It gets even better if you have the money for DLCs.
3239,this game is perfect to turn your bored empty head into something magical
3240,accha hai very good
3241,nice
3242,"Highly addictive.
You start ""Oh I'll just play an hour"" and when you look up the day is gone. :)
If you like SimCity, this is for you."
3243,this is fun and time consuming with endless assets!
3244,buggy mess
3245,can build your own imaginary cities
3246,"This game incorporates a lot of cool ideas from the old Sim City games, but it might be the least intuitive game I have ever played. I have spent more time googling why things don't work than actually playing the game. I am at 2 hours now just trying to figure out why I can't finish my subway line. I have never been as frustrated with a game as I am with this."
3247,i my 60000 rupees laptopthe game will crash and crash again
3248,zjbs
3249,Realy good game. I realy like tkis!
3250,Takes me back to SimCity 4
3251,This is one of my favourite video games of all time.
3252,boutta istall mods im high as fuck but i like it so far tbh
3253,Is the city builder that everybody needs
3254,good
3255,10 million in debt :)
3256,yes
3257,Great Game. Dont add to many mods
3258,"good
"
3259,its pretty fun
3260,"Great game if you like in-depth management games! It's worth waiting until you can get a bunch of DLC on sale or pick up a humble bundle, otherwise the base game is bare bones. One thing I struggled with is you really need 16GB RAM. I'm running 8GB and it only just works with a couple of alterations. There's some amazing mods out there, and the developers seem really invested. I really impressed with the scale and complexity of the game; definitely the best city builder I've played so far."
3261,"The vanilla version of this game is a decent city management simulator.

A heavily modded version of this game is simply the best digital diorama / landscape simulator available. 

It's kind of stupid how many hours of my life this game has sucked away."
3262,Great game.  I used to play Sim City but this game has way more room to grow.
3263,Overall a fun game. Huge workshop and modding community. Can definitely recommend!
3264,A great city building game.  Still updates and has fun expansions and there are nice mods out there.  It's easy to get lost in the game.
3265,Great game
3266,"Like for Cheese Burrito :) :) :), Dislike for Satan >:( >:( >:("
3267,"[h1]Very Good: But Watch A Couple Beginner YouTube Videos To Help Start Your City[/h1]

A very fun city simulation game. One of the best out there in my opinion. The game is very in depth, and there is a lot of content to explore. If you like both management and sandbox games, this game is a great choice. My only issue with the game is that I found that the start of the game/the tutorial is very lacking and doesn't do a good job of explaining things. That may be because of me, however, I would fully recommend watching a couple of beginner Youtube videos on how to start a city, as they are [b]MILES[/b] better than the default tips/tutorial given in game.

The dlc's, while receiving mixed reviews, are definitely worth it when on sale. They add a lot of great gameplay features, and I personally believe that they get mixed reviews because the community is quite [i]picky[/i].

I would recommend using mods ([i]all of which can be easily downloaded through the steam marketplace[/i]), at the very least TMPE and Node Controller:

"
3268,"So much to learn and develop, such an interesting game"
3269,Traffic Time
3270,very good city building game but can get stressful. I'd recommend playing with a friend with the multiplayer mod.
3271,Build a beautiful city and then destroy it with a poop volcano
3272,"The [strike] Sims [/strike] Cims complain about everything, 10/10, realistic as a potato with a hundred thousand volts coursing through it"
3273,Great Game
3274,"This game is great, amazing quality- fantastic job. There are some faults in the code, but it's definitely better than SimCity. I recommend to all looking for a better game than other City simulators / emulators"
3275,if You Want To Know What Cities Skylines is Search it On Youtube and Watch Videos On It.
3276,Lovely city management game! 10/10 would recommend!
3277,super fun game 10/10
3278,we watch the cars
3279,"very nice
"
3280,good fun fun yes
3281,"love it
"
3282,my wife came back with the kids after I played the game
3283,Fun for the first 60 hours. Addictive for the following 1000. Gud game.
3284,"The greatest city builder game. Very recommended for city builder game
"
3285,is fun
3286,Big Traffic
3287,nice
3288,Fun game to play
3289,Like it
3290,good
3291,Good game. Would've bought all the DLC if it wasnt ridiculously expensive... Developers lost out due to this as I ended up downloading it via other means...
3292,With good tutorials you will come far! Very easy to play and to grind!
3293,fun
3294,"This game teaches you the mechanics of city-building very well and it is a very entertaining traffic simulator. The 3rd party addons add to your building experience. 8.5/10, I'd recommend."
3295,"It is mainly a simulation construction game, which feels very similar to the Civilization series. This game is not very friendly to beginners, and it takes a while to get used to it. But as an FPS player, I am not very interested in this type of games, I think building simulation can be purchased, otherwise I recommend playing Minecraft."
3296,"Amazing game, with its expanse of DLC, you can make your dream city!"
3297,"its my love, I made my irl home after getting inspiration from this game :p , wish many mods essentially be part of base game"
3298,"Everything you ever wished SimCity was when you were younger and with built in ability to mod and create your own things. 

If you like world building and city creation with a generally easy to manage/simple to understand mechanics. This game will easily provide greater than 1 hour per dollar spent of entertainment. 100% recommend this game."
3299,p
3300,hmmm
3301,Time killing. Just need to remap the AI
3302,Its really cool to build cities
3303,Game got me an A+ on a project. GG worth the 950 hours spent playing.
3304,"If you love Sim City, you will love this game.. It's like Sim City on steroids.."
3305,"Fun and challenging early game, with easier progression building roads, structures, and budgeting middle game."
3306,Really fun for creative people like me!
3307,"Hundreds of hours of enjoyment. 
If you like city builders this is a great pick. 
It is a bit old and showing it's age.
Most issues you'll encounter (or maybe you wont) can be resolved with mods. 
Mods are a big part of this game as is the YouTube community."
3308,"great game
"
3309,shit
3310,"It provided me with a new perspective on the old SimCity I played for decades, yep since 1990.  I enjoy this game although I didn't think I need to add all of these mods to unlock resources and such.  Like to see more help with getting transit more financially responsible.  Trains are not THAT bad nor can I find how to use Air Routes.  Those areas need help.  Yet the play has been great so far.  I'm happy 100% but maybe impressed 75% due to some missing stuff from SimCity."
3311,"Great city building game. With Mod it just brings a whole different experience. However, I wish there's someway to optimized the game. Even monster PC still having a hard time dealing with the simulation with 200k+ population. Maybe it'll be better in CS 2, if there'll be any sequel..."
3312,Ver nice
3313,"A great city builder. Haven't play a city builder since the Sims 2, so it has been awhile. I decided to try Cities and have loved it since. If you can afford a couple of the dlc's, it really enhances the game play. Looking forward to the journey ahead."
3314,Best city builder game
3315,"In this game, you will begin your mayoral duties with optimism and integrity. Doing your best to ensure the citizens of this town will prosper and inspire progress and innovation! The rush of the first laid road and the tongue-biting concentration trying to create your first roundabout are only in the first few moments of the game! You're already excellent at this! 10/10 for Cities Skylines in the City Skylines category of games. 

Be warned, however, for on your 40th 'year' - the town becomes...alive if I recall correctly.
"
3316,gud
3317,"Everything that SimCity should and could of been. Some of the DLC's seem to be cash grabs but they always added free updates to the base game that added more functionality and is easily one of the greatest games at all times, and I'll gladly support their DLC's simply because I adore this game so much. Don't miss out on this game if you want a chill, fun game with infinite replayability"
3318,i enjoy map games
3319,WHY IS IT PINK???? FIX THIS PLEASE????
3320,"The platform is extremely inaccessible to people regardless of age or creed. STEAM is what's wrong with western society AND corporate America. If i could sue one company for free based off the stress it has caused me, I'd sue Apple, but STEAM is still high up there."
3321,nice 69
3322,"I love the game and others like it, but I am desperately bad at it. If I could change anything, I would love a sandbox mode, so I can build an actual city and not end up with a ghost town lol."
3323,"I've poured over 200 hours into the game at the time of writing this review. Cities skylines is the best city builder I've played to date, and I doubt it will be topped for a long time. If you enjoy the genre - and have a soft spot for traffic management- this one is not to be missed. 9/10, would have got full points if not for the classic paradox DLC gambit."
3324,"This game is WAYTOODANK, props to those real Engineer out there"
3325,"yes

"
3326,I'm bad at the game so its bad
3327,"someone complained that the city had high tax rates so i bulldozed their house 

10/10 no one has complained ever since
"
3328,very good building game with mods
3329,shitties skylines
3330,DLCs are way too ecpensive.
3331,"Don't want use bulldozer for reverting something. 
What's the point planning? You cannot planning without create
I didn't like tutorials it's not helpful"
3332,"Great building game
"
3333,Neat
3334,";)
"
3335,this game is class bro. If you have the time give it a shot like
3336,"i love killing people
"
3337,great workshop community!
3338,yeah
3339,This is the only game that makes me excited to plan out bus routes.
3340,"its really amazing to play
"
3341,good
3342,400 hours and still counting :)
3343,"Its fun destroying things and makeing poopcanos bc why not
"
3344,it good
3345,I should have been revising for important exams but instead I played this
3346,good game
3347,"The best city building games ever been released, The DLC is a must have if you decided to invest some experience and money to this game. The must have expansions DLC to grab is the Industry and Parklife but it actually according to your preference on how you build your city. Happy building :)"
3348,"cool not pool
"
3349,I used cheats to get achievements
3350,Better than Sim city by a long shot
3351,"PARADOX at some point i would like my soul back. Just not yet.

This Game is beyond addicting and I have spent entirely too much time playing it and enjoyed every minute of it. I got it on console(XBOX) first and realized its potential and got it on PC repurchased DLC and dug in to mods to fix most of any issue. While I love the Concept and the groundwork Paradox has created this game is propped up on its modding community, Those guys building assets and mods in the workshop is truly what makes this game great.

*IMPORTANT*
This game is will require heavy modding as you go deeper and try to build more complex non basic cities. 
The default driving AI: That way lies madness.
IF NOTHING ELSE GET TMPE TRAFFIC MANAGER mod.

SIDE NOTE:
Never in my life did i think i would be watching youtube videos on how real life interchanges/intersections/metro/trains/trolleys/busses operate in order to build better transit systems for a game, but here I am 2k+ hours down a rabbit hole with no end in sight."
3352,"I actually have over 100 hours in this game and I can say I enjoy it. But, it is sad how much money you need to get all the DLC for this game. This was supposed to be better than SimCity but they are going the same route as EA with the infinite amount of DLC's without lowering the price of the old ones, the only good thing is they don't have any micro-transactions. You will get your money's worth with this game, but I will suggest skipping the DLC's."
3353,Great game
3354,First Of All You Can Build Anything You Want. Second The Mods Dont Only Make the game better they also make your experience immersive. Third The community Full Of helpfull guids Kind people This Non toxic environment makes the game more calm and peace. Fourth The DLC Some Dlc Are Worth Like Mass Transit And Green Cities Some Are Not But Still helpful in game. Fifth This One Is My Only Complaint About This Game Its the optimization. Paradox Please optimize this game But thanks to the modding community I have a bunch of moda that help my performance. Overall This Game Is AMAZING Its The Best City Building Game Best Indie Game For Me I Really Recommend this game if you like indie/city building games. Bye Have A Good Day.
3355,all of my houses are full of garbage
3356,very fun
3357,Took me forever to try this game and I have not looked back since. Free on Epic Games but I got it on steam so i could try the work shop stuff. I play the eff out of this game until my butt hurts. Until my eyes hurt.
3358,"Distracting I love it
"
3359,"I use this game to unwind after work.

Get the Industries DLC, it makes some pretty huge changes to the game and is worth it.

:D"
3360,"I PLACED SO MANY SCHOOLS AND NO ONE WOULD GO TO THEM AND I NEED WORKERS, I HAVE LOOK UP SO MANY TUTORIALS!"
3361,GOod
3362,Simply put a new age SimCity all you need to know.
3363,"So rebuilt my water sector and forgot to put electricity to the drainage for 1 day game hours, that caused half my city to riot and lost 100 population due to half the city turning to crime which I named ""The Flush Massacre"" 

Good game"
3364,Good Game
3365,A massively epic city builder. Has everything you could possibly want to manage.
3366,.
3367,This is the best city building game ever built still. The graphics are better than any coming out now. Tons of add-ons which is a good thing.
3368,"Making a city where there is the hammer and sickle, swaztika, the usd symbol, and the mcdonalds symbol using canals full of sewage is very funny
"
3369,Love this game :)
3370,Its the dankness
3371,not good for pepole who hate strees but other than that epic game
3372,I greatly raised taxes and provided medium quality services. This game is great!
3373,The game is more of a traffic management simulator but its still fun.
3374,"This game is an investment, but not any kind of investment. This is a life investment and the best of life investments you could imagine. So what are you waiting for? Go and buy this game and give your meticulousness a try!"
3375,Good game is good.  9.8/10.
3376,It Fun if you like to think
3377,"great game
"
3378,"Very entertaining game though if you really want to enhance your city-building experience you're definitely going to need some mods. My personal favorites: Move It, Node Controller, and Intersection Marking Tool. 10/10 would recommend."
3379,"after the purchase, i installed the game, played first night, everything ok and happy to start playing this game. But steam platform is a mess, and the next day when i started the game the problems started to came up and requested to install visual ++ and other stuff, to check the integrity of the game. I checked all the forums, seems a lot of people with similar problems, i tried to fallow the instruction, but with no luck, the alst thing is to reinstall my laptop, but this is crazy and will not do it. ill try to discuss and opt for refund the money that i paid for the game. Good luck in the future !"
3380,"Summery:
Cities skyline is a great game where you can let you imagination take on a building spree and possibly make some amazing low traffic city. one thing that limit the score i can give is sometimes it feels like the game is left for modders to fix bugs that are introduced in DLC'S.

3381,"This game super fun if you like tycoons, biulding, or growing things. I think most things are on point about this game accept one thing, which rotating certain things such as tolls. So if the developers can, please find an another way for mac users to rotate easier with. One thing is the road building, wich has weird quikrs that I can't explain, but thta really isn't an issue. Besides those things the game is absoluty amazing."
3382,its an ok game fun to waste time in but likie other paradox interactive it games it can be a bit much at times
3383,albania flooded
3384,fun
3385,Nice..
3386,this game is realy good thats it
3387,It's adictive but very hard
3388,its pretty good
3389,"Let your imagination run free, great game."
3390,I love this game from 2016 year. I am happy what have this game. <333333
3391,"great, amazing, excellent, showstopping, marvellous, fantastic, awesome, out of this world, never been done before"
3392,Great game!
3393,"I have been playing this game since the release in 2015. Not every day, but every now and then I revisit this game. The DLC's keep Cities Skylines very enjoyable. 10/10"
3394,good
3395,It's a great game to play!
3396,"Soooooo realistic and has many features to make your city world as immersive and close to real life as possible, i next time would only want the all the extensions pack to be slightly cheaper as i really want the full experience but can't afford it currently. Too be a bit cheaper that's my only negative comment, otherwise amazing game! (could play and talk about it for hours on end)"
3397,This is such a good game i highly recommend buying it
3398,looking for city buikding game but ended in 3D modeling
3399,"As a Simcity 3000 enjoyer, I find this game too realistic and complex. The sheer amount of decisions, things to build and planning to be made makes my head spin and makes me lose interest in the game.

Good game, though I would still prefer the old grid-based SimCity lol"
3400,nice traffic sim
3401,"Fun and relaxing game, 10/10"
3402,"I built a utopia, then I flooded it with raw sewage. Then I chose that it needed to be cleaned by asteroids....there were millions dead. But I didn't care."

3407,very fun
3408,"It is hard to get into, But it is very fun ( especially with loads of mods ) Sure I have almost 60hrs, But I have yet to actually build a functional big city lmao. Keep running into problems ( not with the game mind you ) with myself mainly. I keep starting over a city because I just did not like it. and my ocd kicks it. I am gonna allow comments, does anyone recommend any suggestions? or YouTubers I can watch and learn? Never really played any city-building games before. 

TIA"
3409,Joss gandoss 👍🏻
3410,"just try the game
"
3411,its fun i like it when you know what to do
3412,"I like the game, but my computer doesn't. Game gets increasingly BIGGER, and I am on a fixed budget, and can't keep buying another computer to basically pursue a hobby. Bye-bye.
"
3413,Traffic... am I right lads or am I right lads?
3414,Fun game. Nice DLC support. Easy to play while holding a baby in one arm.
3415,yes
3416,Excellent game (dont pay 300$ for it however like I know you will)
3417,"Distance too short. The ui is horrible, and I gave up after half an hour with this game. Distance too short. You can't build roads. ROADS. Distance too short. I don't know how they can screw up such a basic function. Distance too short! DISTANCE TOO SHORT!!!!"
3418,"This really hit the spot for me back in the game, the spot being the rash caused by that city builders itch.
I don't normally play with mods but at the time I last played, many moons ago, there were some very logically balanced mods out there, stuff like roads that's were more typical in GB smaller version of otherwise expensive public assets and such.

I sank a chunk of my life in to this game, and it did bring some very good experiences for me of which I will take back to the E8 once it's my time.

It's been a long while since I've spent life hours on a city sim.
if you want something cheap then grab this, I paid a lot more and have no regrets.
"
3419,cool
3420,i'm something of a city planner myself
3421,AMAZING
3422,Build Chicago. Eat deep dish until your heart explodes. Forget that you never built a hospital and die in your 100th floor penthouse. Your body decays in your home as the mortician is stuck in a 10 mile traffic jam for a month. Increase taxes
3423,good game i guess
3424,epic tool for getting backgrounds for ginormous fat fur blob art
3425,Too many bugs in vanilla
3426,you don't need any other game if you have this
3427,"Spent hours making a city
made huge infrastructures all around and invoked my own policies

I flooded my city in a matter of seconds by accidentally making a dam that covered my city in poo water

10/10 would waste my freetime again."
3428,this game could turn you into a goblin. my friend played this game and is now a goblin his name is goblin dean
3429,"It's amazing - quite simply it's so satisfying to watch tiny little people probably modeled out of plasticine run around into houses, train stations, etc. Also the mods, it's very compatible with modding support and I would absolutely recommend this game to other players. Try and get this game on sale or Humble Bundle though, it's very expensive to get this game with most of the DLCs.

"
3430,Great
3431,very entertaining but i still dont know how to fix uneducated workers lol
3432,
3433,It's got it's moments.

3441,I don't think I can say much that hasn't already been said about this game. It's quite enjoyable. Kudos Paradox.
3442,:)
3443,the best
3444,little confusing to start but once you learn the ropes its a great game
3445,"Paradox can go and eat their own feces. Even on sale and aged since 2015, this game's collection bundle still costs more than $120! Greedy piece of mucus."
3446,could be more car free
3447,Its hella addictive and such a good game to vibe and chill out to! Definitely check out the workshop for mods and assets to see what suits your game style! 10/10!
3448,NAGIH.WKWKWKWKWK
3449,Made a town suffer its a masterpiece
3450,This game makes me sad
3451,"Hands down  one of the best city builder games. 
Some one who grew up playing Sims games, this is a great alternative. 
"
3452,i failed one of my college finals to play this game nonstop! 10/10!
3453,nice
3454,"Even if the game is kind off old now, still fantastic."
3455,I love this game so much. This is the kind of game i can keep playing and playing and not get bored it is so satisfying to sit there and build your own city even if you dont have any dlcs :)
3456,Thanks Humble Bundle for letting me donate to charity and humble while giving none to Paradox and also getting all Cities with dlc for $25. Would get tsunamied again
3457,a
3458,"If you manage to get a sale on this game for <$10 get it. Otherwise, IMO it's not worth it. From no Undo and no planning mode, to extremely buggy traffic systems including a bug on roundabouts that completely locks up traffic (I found the first report of this 7 YEARS ago, still a problem). The only thing that saves this game is the incredible workshop mods that basically fix a lot of the issues."
3459,"I simply blinked and 4 hours went by, so this is why they are called paradox games"
3460,game sucks

[h1] Long Version: [/h1]

This game is probably the best prime example of a city-building simulation. You can
invest a few hours in a small city with the standard game, or you can play with DLCs
and mods. Then it's more like a couple hundred hours.

The DLCs are in my opinion quite well thought out and if you really want to seriously
build cities, they should be worth the money to you. (My favorites are Natural Disasters,
Mass Transit and Industries, the others I bought in a sale).

In terms of modding and community, Cities: Skylines couldn't be more distinctive.
The Steam Workshop is full of buildings, mods, shaders, scenarios, props and much more,
so it can take hours to put together a nice collection. However, it should be noted
that modding goes on the RAM. With 300-500 props (which you can sometimes 
have in it to build beautiful) 16 GB can quickly buckle in the loading screen.

The difficulty level definitely increases with larger cities. Especially when it comes to traffic,
Cities: Skylines has a very ""interesting"" system where, for example, a car likes to switch 
to the right-turn lane 5 kilometers before the intersection. You can spend hours trying 
to solve the huge traffic jams that can form anywhere.

The graphics don't leave much to be desired either, even though the game is now 
over 7 years old, you can still marvel at the huge cities and skylines and if that's
not enough, there are various shaders that make the whole thing a bit more beautiful.

Overall, the game is for me one of the best construction games currently available on
the gaming market. I have spent hours with this game and will continue to do so.
It's definitely worth it!

Thanks for reading, leave a thumbs up or a price if you liked it or if it was helpful :D"

3490,dd
3491,yes big bum chirper xD
3492,10/10
3493,my citizens suffer
3494,Very epic game. The DLCs are too much but the game is fun even without them
3495,It has a very nice simulation and a very good community.
3496,"Dangerously addictive. If you have a good PC that can run this game and it doesn't crash, don't be surprised if you find yourself playing this game for hours and hours.

The creative aspect of this game is the selling point for me - I love being able to creative my own metropolis with every aspect of the city being made from my imagination onto this game, it's seriously addictive. If you want to pick up this sense of freedom, I would recommend having money disabled, or you can have it enabled for even more of a challenge!

The base game is amazing on its own, but I'd suggest picking up a few of the game's DLCs to enhance your experience, in a lot of ways, they make the game even better, adding more variety and more structures to build!

The disadvantages of this game? I would say that the game still needs a lot of optimising. I have an Alienware Aurora R12 gaming PC, one of the strongest PCs out there and still this game in particular can suffer and crash - although that might be because I've also downloaded a lot of mods and assets for this game. Most PCs aren't free from the Cities Skylines crash-syndrome, so make sure to be aware of that if you decide to install mods for the game or install the game on lower-end devices.

I would recommend that you install some mods, mainly to improve gameplay, like being able to immediately unlock all tiles and road anarchy; not imperative but just a recommendation from my experiences.

That being said, if you're able to play the game without it crashing, I believe that you'll find it's one of the best, if not the best, city builder game out there. Even if it's selling on full price, I highly recommend!"
3497,AMAZING
3498,"Needs a little bit patience to understand it but once you're done, you're gonna love it."
3499,fun
3500,"yes but the dlcs are all worth it, and there's so many..."
3501,rlly good!
3502,"You can make this game very easy, or very difficult. Your choice. I like it"
3503,"Incredibly good game, but the game keep crashing because of my low-end laptop."
3504,9/10
3505,Sure thing
3506,"i love this game, i make so many stroads"
3507,The game is not playing
3508,"Great fun game to get engrossed in, although can loose your mind trying to solve the traffic, great fun"
3509,This is one of those games you want to play casually and then suddenly you have like played 5 hours in one session.
3510,Good Game
3511,its good
3512,"Dope lmao
"
3513,Very fun and relaxing
3514,it like city but ok
3515,Feels like an upgraded version of the old Simcity2000.
3516,Finally can build my dream city
3517,"This game is super fun, especially when you're into creative stuff and in customizing something your own way. This city builder lets you build your very own city! It's not just constructing roads and buildings, it can also be creating a park, a campus, or anything a city might have. You can also buy DLCs that can help you fully customize a part of your city just the way you want it to be! This game is fun, you should consider buying it! In my opinion, it's a must have."
3518,its alrite
3519,"Haven't played it for a long while because the game doesn't launch. I have no workshop addons, I have verified the integrity of my game files, it still refuses to launch. Other than the fact that it doesn't work, good game."
3520,"Beware! This game can be a huge rabbit hole, you might spent hours on it!"
3521,I can't play the game on any device I own without the game being blurry. I found comments discussing this problem from 7 years ago and its still an issue. Shocked this game has such positive reviews.
3522,yeah. city
3523,sdsd
3524,"good game

3533,Yes

3535,6.3 hours in one day wow. im already addicted.
3536,yes
3537,game to torture people
3538,really fun
3539,"Annoying at first but once you get the hang of things it is very easy to lose time to. But its still all fun and games till people start dying, losing power, having shit flood their house, and you try to build a dam that fails. But overall a fun game to play and kill time."
3540,fun
3541,I love it! The DLCs are great additions especially if you get them on sale. I'd love to see Cities 2
3542,"It is what Sim City 2013 should have been. Having played many a city builder in my childhood, this truly is the spiritual successor to sim city. haven't played any other newer city building games that even come close!"

3549,"A long time ago I played a game called Metropolis. It was a phone game that taught me a lesson about p2w games because I ended up spending money in a free game just to speed up building, buy resources, and other BS. I stopped playing f2p p2w after that.
I wish I had this game back then because I was stupid to pay the premium. This game is great. Amazing even. Dont waste your time with city builder games that a free to play. Buy this, and enjoy the freedom to create and design anything without the limit of premium currency."
3550,"Great to just sit and waste time, but I have found a MAJOR issue with setting warehouses to empty. Trucks will CONSTANTLY move goods from one warehouse to another creating unnecessary traffic and clogging roads. Needs to look at if any buildings need goods first and then attempt to sell goods outside the city."
3551,I have lost too much sleep playing this.
3552,If you're looking for a city builder you came to the right place. Possibilities are endless here and only thing limiting you is your own imagination. Whatever the game lacks you can probably find in the workshop section and build a city of your dreams. Game is very rewarding and every player should have it in their library.
3553,Brilliant game to waste time.. you need mods to make it reralistic
3554,"Sorry Sim City, this is the definitive city builder"
3555,it was fun and a really calm game
3556,yes city
3557,lines through the sky
3558,"I sat down to play this game for the first time. Eight hours later the sun is up and I'm still tempted to keep going.
Needless to say this game has a way of drawing you in. I don't regret a second."
3559,Hyvä
3560,I don't even own this game wtf
3561,i uajdjhfbdsfjhgsdghshdgfjsfdshhgjsdfghjdfshgjdfshgdsfhgjdsfghdfshgjdfs
3562,Useless tutorials dont waste your time unless you are willing to spend time on a wiki or something similar.
3563,nobody wants to live in my city
3564,"Easily becoming one of my favorite simulations, coming from a long lineup of SimCity and Civ fav's. The game is extremely addictive and will consume you. Especially if you are constantly enhancing your game play experience with the many thousands of mods available and still being developed on the active workshop shop. The DLC's should have been part of the game and only a few are worthwhile when you can get them on sale, but be warned that the more you add, the more ram you will need. Just added another 32gb to my system to handle the last 3 DLC's I purchased, 2 of which I kinda regret. I can't see myself buying anymore as they add very little, but do change the experience with a few additional challenges. Overall this is a great game with long lasting playability and realism."
3565,i hate traffics
3566,"Great game. Endless hours of fun. Pretty much fills the itch SC4 left in me. Although my only criticism is the ugliness of most vanilla buildings. The European theme for high desity is good, realistic and attractive. However I find almost every vanilla asset in all other map themes and every density to be incredibly ugly and unrealistic. However with the use of the workshop and some of the DLC's this helps this. More options for service buildings would be useful, for example the default police buildings, and passenger train station are very unattractive. Overall its great and provides challenges you need to solve, and makes you think about planning which is something that took me a while to understand how all the different roads worked! Once you get into it and start playing with mods and assets it allows you to create just about any style of city you want. I also highly recommend the Parklife DLC, as this allows you to create realistic open spaces and adds considerable interest to your cities!"
3567,good gam
3568,"I played Sim City series as a teen and always really enjoyed them... and always thought about re-starting to play them.  Sadly, they are no longer in series and definitely very aged.  I see Cities Skylines as an excellent modern and more involving evolution of the games I enjoyed and if anything I am enjoying this even more than I ever did with Sim City games.  Thoroughly recommended, but also recommend watching a few Youtube tutorials when starting."
3569,i likie i like
3570,good game:)
3571,Finally loaded the game after 2 hours
3572,unlimited options very cool
3573,Its fun i guess
3574,Best City builder game ever never start boring me it has great workshop and many things to do
3575,The best city building game!
3576,yum
3577,Best game if ur ever tired of sweaty games
3578,cool
3579,"amazing
"
3580,amazing
3581,Very soothing game. Fun to watch your lil peeps run back and forth.
3582,Wonderful city builder. Enjoyable complexity at an accessible pace.  Enjoy getting lost in this for a while each expansion.
3583,GOOD FOR PEOPLE THAT LIKE TO BUILD CITIES
3584,"Game used to be good, real good.  Most of the good mods were killed off and it's DLC hell now."
3585,very fun game
3586,Addicting
3587,"Build City, Make Economy, Micro manage. Cry every time you have to demolish a abandoned building."
3588,"A better sim city but the vanilla traffic can rapidly become game-breaking, fantastic mod community to help that though."
3589,cities skylines to me is like genshin to Fst
3590,Great game/sim to pass the hours (and hours and hours and hours...)
3591,no
3592,"No medium density zoning, no mixed use zoning and barely any decent bicycling infrastructure in the base game. This game seriously might as well just be a remake of the SimCity games from the 1990's. I still think it's impressive that the devs were able to make a game as large as this given how small the dev team is, but that doesn't excuse the fact that there is barely any  meaningful new features in this game compared to games that were made 30 years ago. Hopefully the devs will be more ambitious with Cities Skylines 2."
3593,"This game is great, I love it. It's very calming. Love watching the traffic flow, if you play you understand."
3594,good game
3595,"Sim city 4 ruined the city sim. Then came Cities: Skylines, which reinvigorated the city sim. Then became a new standard! I have been playing city sims from the original sim city on windows 98 PC. This city sim replaced EA's city sim and stayed to formula without the monetization or required online play. Have you a sim city crave? Play Cities: Skylines!"
3596,It's a very fun game but a little complicated at the start would recommend
3597,amazing simulation and good for chilling :)
3598,sim game
3599,GOOD GAME HOWEVER PARADOX CAN MUNCH ON MY BALLS. THEY RUIN EVERY GAME THEY GET THEIR GRUBBY MITTS ON
3600,Play this game instead of studying city-planning
3601,"Its a greate game, i love the games where you build cities. i recomande it"
3602,"its wonderful game
"
3603,Cities Skylines is a game that offers a lot to a player who likes to see buildings and societies grow.
3604,"I am a 45 yo father, probably one of the oldest people playing this game. I am a single farther to my Son, who is 14 now. Ahaha just kidding I'm a millennial with a vasectomy. 

This is easily the most detailed city builder available. That being said, I would describe it more as a ""city painter"" than ""city management"", it's pretty easy to have a successful city. Most of the actual management comes from traffic management, which is still surprisingly fun and in-depth.

I don't like how the DLC is adds so much to the price tag. The DLC themselves are mostly fine though; MOST of them are unique enough that they don't feel like content was specifically carved out to charge us more.

It's a super chill game. It's great for lowering your heartrate or winding down after a long day."
3605,Very good game. You can even expand the gameplay with the workshop!
3606,yes
3607,"Nice
"
3608,"brilliant city builder, takes a bit of time to fully get your head around everything but on the whole amazing. It is a shame DLC is overpriced though."
3609,"Good game for relaxing, amazing game mehanic, only problem is that there are so many dlc, so if you dont have that much money to spend, basic game isnt that good as it with all dlc"
3610,Sewage city 10/10
3611,It’s a decent game but DLC is overpriced and basic features are only sorted with getting mods from steam workshop
3612,Amazing
3613,"This game came out in 2015 and is still the best city building game since sim city 4. Only a few games come close and they don't try to be modern day city builders(Anno 1800, Frostpunk)"

3616,A city building simulator where all the citzens complain about is shit and trash and then beg for more retail when they just abandon it 10 minutes later. 10/10 would drop a Meteor onto 5 city blocks again
3617,Because.
3618,I mean it's Cities Skylines... Literal best sim game.
3619,Very cool its like sim city but better because the naurtal disaters but its like real life
3620,cool and relaxing
3621,"Buy this game if:
- You have genius-level IQ OR
- You're ready to waste a few dozen hours of your life learning how to pump poop out of a city and spend a day crafting a highly intricate lattice of barely functional highways"
3622,ye
3623,"This game has been out for many years so I'm not sure what else needs to be said.  I am a city planner.  This game is the best thing to come out since Sim City 2000 and Sim City 4.  It's fun, dynamic and lets me play ultimate planning god."
3624,My favorite game.
3625,very VERY fun cool to see your city to all go togeter
3626,pro
3627,its a very great game
3628,Love it! I first played SimCity and enjoy that but the customisation you have in Cities Skylines is second to none. If you like city builders this game if for you
3629,"very good and chill games for either lonely nights or when you feel like dominating the world ! some mods are must-haves but otherwise the base game is really good, plus the dlc's are super cool"
3630,"Probably one of my most-played games, and for good reason. It's got quite a learning curve to a) build a city that functions and b) build something that looks GOOD, but with time (and lots of YouTube tutorials) you can start to build something that feels right. Mod support is plentiful, though some things feel downright essential when playing, such as the MoveIt mod, which helps with the very finicky road-building tools the base game provides.

I do have some qualms with the DLC -- without adding them on the base game feels like it's pretty... empty. There are a lot of things that feel like they should be included from the get-go, especially some of the mass-transit add-ins of newer packs like Sunset Harbor. The DLCs are not required and you can still have fun without them, but a lot of the new features added by them make the game a lot more enjoyable. Figuring out which ones appeal to you is probably for the best -- I'm a sucker for building massive tram networks so the Snowfall DLC is a must-buy for me, but maybe you're more of a monorail guy, so you should get Mass Transit (which doesn't include trams for some reason?). Check YouTube playthroughs and see if anyone uses a pack that really strikes your fancy. Some of the newer DLC packs have AMAZING starting maps too, which sadly aren't free.

Overall a really fun game, even if there are a lot of little frustrations in the design (especially wrt mixed-use zoning or the lack of middle density). Mods can help a lot, as can the DLC, but hoo boy are all the DLC together expensive. Don't bother with the radio packs, though."
3631,good
3632,monke.
3633,very good very nice
3634,sure its ok :p
3635,kk
3636,DLC Simulator? Why not atleast add a feature to be able to sell DLCs in the game?
3637,Good
3638,Gucci game!!
3639,"Basically traffic management the game.

SimCity 4 still has the best handling of wealth and poverty in the entire city-building genre, but C:S provides a decent alternative on logistics and traffic, not to say the modding ability."
3640,:DDD
3641,"A huge step from the old standards of the genre. Not a mere city builder, it's a city simulator. However mods and assets are a must - some basic features completely change the game.
The community is awesome.
The possibilities are endless.
Contact NASA in time for your RAM needs though."
3642,A nice relaxing game to play. it takes a little bit of time to learn but is rewarding
3643,"wow
"
3644,"This game is made for people who want to make people drink sewage without actually doing it.
 7/10, to much paid for content. Good graphics, in depth economics and environment. Good luck industrialising a city assholes."
3645,Grate Gam
3646,Better than SimCity
3647,"Although I don't have the most adequate laptop for gaming, this game is totally reccommendable. I started this game after I watched someone playing it on Youtube, and I've been playing it since 2019. The DLCs are great, although sometimes I think some DLCs are overpriced such as Natural Disasters. I haven't experienced any sort of crashes or bugs, and I subscribed to mods and assets, and they worked perfectly fine. I think this game is one of the most polished games."
3648,"Favourite city-builder by far!!!

Many, many hours in and I still love this game!!!"
3649,"Easy to learn, hard to master. Such a fun game for someone who is a problem solver"
3650,"calming and addictive
"
3651,pretty good
3652,cities skylines is an open world creative game start from land build a road to start making your city. you will be building a whole city. start with building a small community and industrial area. level up by making you'r community larger in size grow the population! you will unlock new materials as you keep playing learn how to keep you community happy and you will start making profits and build more. Its a fun and addictive game to play and you will enjoy every moment of this game. Its a simple creative game on how to manage a city and your responsibilities as mayor is to keep everything in check and running smooth. you can learn from mistakes. you will have fun playing cities skylines at anyage
3653,yes
3654,very goid
3655,Love it
3656,"It's easy to follow and there is a lot to it. You can pretty much design a city however you would like, and there are realistic benefits or drawbacks to how your city is designed. I developed a random new interest in watching urban planning YouTube videos, and Cities: Skylines is about as realistic as you'd need it to be. I only have the base game, and that alone is very fun."
3657,"This game is very immersive.  Overall, very fun and reasonably complex."
3658,p
3659,oh yeah bud
3660,amazing game for geeks like me
3661,"Brilliant game, played for so long"
3662,gud
3663,Super fun and endless things to do
3664,amazing!!!!
3665,i shall dump all my sewage on my citizens
3666,great game recommend disasters DLC
3667,69
3668,"The game is fun but simply way too easy. If you get through the first hour or so, it's impossible to go bankrupt and your city will keep growing no matter what. After a couple of hours all you'll be doing is managing the traffic.
Still a fun game and there aren't really any better modern alternatives."
3669,yuqwrdheqywe
3670,This game takes a lot of practice and research but defenitely addicting
3671,
3672,cool gam
3673,i really enjoying it so far i highly recomend getting it it will take some time to get use to it
3674,"If you like to build communities, cities, farms, industries or any variation in between and know that you are supported a massive development community then this game is for you."
3675,"Really fun sim game, there are quite a lot of DLC that should've probably been apart of the base game but it's ok because there are a lot of things included in the base game already. Worth mentioning that the DLC seems pretty good and seems like it expands on the base game quite well, but I haven't tried any so I can't say personally."
3676,Great game. Big fun
3677,"great fun, addictive and entertains."
3678,
3679,Game is good
3680,I wish this game didnt have so many paid DLC's because it would be a masterpiece if it weren't for that blemish.
3681,cool
3682,Its nice
3683,fun
3684,"I have played all the Sim City releases and enjoy this type of game.  Cities Skylines really lets you create and see results quickly ,I have built several cities now and learn from each one of them . the community is vast and very forthcoming ."
3685,"its good

3686,Nobu stop checking my steam activity :tf:

3690,devs are unable to fix bugs
3691,good game
3692,DLC BLOAT. Hard pass.
3693,Its a nice game for quite a time. And then maybe for some time after that. What the hell is happening to me. *gets sucked into portal*
3694,a good game
3695,"My pc is butt butter, but mods make this game 2000x better than the base game"
3696,Yes
3697,"One of the best city sims ever made. The base game already offers great gameplay but all the DLCs and, more important, the mods, really make this the game you could keep playing forever."
3698,"Vanilla version is great, workshop takes it over the top!"
3699,Made me think i can actually plan a city.
3700,Fun when bored.
3701,"chicken

3702,"I want to like it, but inexplicable decisions like the water physics makes it frustrating. Oh, you slightly adjusted the terrain 10 minutes ago? Your whole city is suddenly a lagoon, hope you saved."
3703,build
3704,
3705,I originally was playing this game on console and while it was enjoyable I didn't feel like I was able to manage things as well. Recently I swapped over to PC and am flourishing. The amount of resources I have found online to help me better understand the game have been a great help in managing how my cities start out as well as how I can improve them over time. This has very quickly become one of my favorite games to play!
3706,One of the few #educational games on steam.
3707,"It's nice to see more and more building abandoned. They seems frustrated, just like me."
3708,Awesome game!
3709,very good
3710,"Only took 7 failed attempts -- one of which ended in meteoric catastrophe and a split-second 10,000 foot increase in sea level -- to get a fugly albeit functional city that I can commit to."
3711,buy this buy that no realism just sandbox

3713,pretty good but need to buy dlc for best experiace

3715,This game saved me during 2020 Lockdown. It still hasn't let me go
3716,I jsut love cities skylines :D
3717,"Wonderful city simulator, although keeping traffic smooth can get very hard after cities expand multiple times."
3718,"Bought this recently and I have to say, I've been completely hooked from the start. 
Great gameplay, the mechanics are simple once you understand them. 
Would highly recommend this game!
"
3719,very gud
3720,good
3721,"Of course it's not a bad idea to put all of our waste into a gigantic hole, there's no way this could go wrong."
3722,"Cities Skylines is a wonderful revival of the classic city-builder. Some city builders make difficult-to-follow advancements or don't give you enough money to get services. Cities Skylines is the opposite: every time you level up you get a cash bonus to pay for the new responsibilities. However, this is not to say it is a walk in the park. You have to be able to manage a city's fire, police, water, etc. The developers did a great job of ensuring that you don't have to stress, as you unlock things slowly and over time. This creates an easy flow of difficulty."
3723,build cities till you get wrecked by traffic jams and start over
3724,good game
3725,yku
3726,"Great mechanics, makes it challenging when you first discover the game"

3730,great game
3731,"If you're of an age to remember playing SimCity during your synaptically formative years, and  you remember it fondly, this game is for you. Everything you loved about SimCity is here, only way better. WAY better. 
"
3732,"This game was fun and actually very challenging for the first half, but after a certain point it is near impossible to lose and just becomes an idle game. This game is quite fun but very short. I bought the game on sale for like $10 and I think that is a fair price. But I wouldn't spend the $30 it is now."

3734,"You don't get full product unless you buy tons of DLCs. Paradox Games are bunch of assholes, they should learn from LK Avalon, creators of ""Sołtys"""

3737,Really good I recommend you get it
3738,I know it's not as easy as it sounds to build the city and unlock everything without cheats but it sure is fun! Not to mention the scenarios you need to figure out should that be the way you go... it's just lots of challenging fun!
3739,"The game is beatiful! I liked it very much. It would make more sense to just remove the DLC's and sell them together with the game. I bought Cities: Skylines Collection. I would pay that much money for this game, but some people don't know the game at all. They can't get the full experience of the game is bad, how will they know? That's why they take the simple form. Maybe they will enjoy it to its fullest? The simplicity of the game is bad. So what? Nothing (except with DLC). I've experimented with the game with a few DLC's. I played a little before. If I didn't know the game, I wouldn't pay this much (585,30TL) for the game. In short, combine regular gameplay with DLC's. I recommed."
3740,i love this game
3741,Great city building sim for great minds
3742,Great game!
3743,This game is good for people wanting a big challenge
3744,You can drown people with poop
3745,Great game!
3746,be careful this game will take over your life. I've called out of work to work on my University and start a forestry industry. HELP
3747,"There are very few games that evoke a feeling of pure zen while playing them, even though you may be challenging yourself with an especially difficult scenario or set of personal restrictions. This is one of those games, and even in the most challenging circumstances the game still produces an overall sense of chill.

One of the greatest aspects is in how you can spend a short period of time building a city, and continue the save as long as you want.

Highly recommend for anyone looking to break free from the chaos of shooters or battle royales!"
3748,very fun and long term fun at that
3749,This is the pinnacle.
3750,This game made me go down the city planning to c0mmun1st pipeline and I am 100% grateful for it.
3751,This game is a very complex and customizable city builder that really does its job well. I've already started watching youtube videos on how to make my city better than it is.
3752,This is a fantastic game. operation is smooth and the capabilities are endless. Definitely one of the best city simulators on the market today.

3756,"This game is very fun, it allows you to control cities in many different ways, funny, seriously, etc. However, issues with the game is that when you put down services (clinics, police) the building surrounding that service only get help from it. The other buildings stay in their bad state. Another issue is that props do not work, when I click to place them, they are not there."
3757,A fun voyage in Civil Engineering.
3758,"Cities Skylines has: Greedy DLC overdrive resulting in isolated game systems that don't properly interact with each other. Bad vanilla camera controls that can only be partially fixed with mods. And sooner or later, every city gets choked to death by traffic, pretty much no matter what you do. This game isn't flawed, it's just junk, and it always has been. Play SimCity 4 instead."
3759,Best City Simulation Game!
3760,All and all this game is very good the overall game dynamics are excellent rare errors this gets me reminiscing about times I had played Sim city on my first computer lots of content out the gate I strongly recommend green city DLC first for the beginners out there it gives more options to clean up pollution around the city that is always nagging on you throughout the base game
3761,Somehow I have worse urban planning than america.
3762,"Fun city builder. Might get boring for some tho, good for ocd people xD"
3763,train
3764,Solid game. Entertaining for hours.
3765,This is certainly my dream game! I love it so much!
3766,i liked it
3767,good
3768,"The game itself is a lot of fun. What completely ruins it is the AI (and road building to some extent). It is quite literally impossible to improve traffic flow because of the stupid AI. They will always insist on driving in the same lane no matter how many lanes there are available, thus creating man-made traffic jams even though there is plenty of space for vehicles to drive. Trying out different intersection designs only improves flow either insignificantly or just moves the traffic jam somewhere else. Even mods do not fix this. This only becomes noticeably once your city starts to grow in size. The road building does not allow for smooth merging of roads, leading to awkward angles that only cause more traffic issues. Besides the FPS being a little on the low side, if these problems did not exist, I would rate this game a solid 9/10."
3769,"Great game, requires time and patience. After building a few beginner cities, you can start to create greater cities which you will always be proud of.

This game works for everyone, either you want to have a bit of fun and chill, or you are a creative person."
3770,"Its a decent game
"
3771,-
3772,"decent game, but without mods/DLCs its after 50 hours boring. So, I really recommend this game but also get some mods. Every week or so, on Cities Skylines official YouTube channel is Top 10 mods/assets."
3773,great game
3774,"i loved it
"
3775,Probably the greatest city builder since Sim City 4. Worth installing a few mods to help with micro management.
3776,"It's scary how fast time flies by while you're in this game. And I'm only half-joking.

The game itself has a LOT of content and it's fairly easy to get creative in your city designs even if you aren't that creative in general. The modding scene is very prevalent and evergrowing.

That being said, I can't say getting the entire package for nearly 200 quid is quite steep (I'd suggest waiting for sale or humble bundle). The base game is definitely worth the asking price as you can utilise vanilla elements surprisingly well to mimic the DLC content. Additionally, given how many mods this game has available for free, that already gives the game so much more content."
3777,i can play this game all day
3778,"IT is a cooool game
"
3779,worked fine up until a week ago. game wont load. tried a bunch of shit in the forums and nothing is working. completely uninstalled both steam and csl but nothing is working
3780,I suck at this game lol
3781,Just seems to miss something to me. Idk.
3782,like it!!
3783,Make city.
3784,cool
3785,Big fun. I love when traffic gets out of control and ruins everything you worked for in life. 10/10 I'm playing again.
3786,"Very fun game. I love every moment playing the game and the Steam Workshop has tons of assets, mods, etc that make the game so much fun. Would highly recommend playing it."
3787,"Great game, even better with mods. 
Start without mods first though, until you find the limits, then maximize your potential with mods.

For this game, you need to be able to thin far ahead and your first ten cities WILL FAIL. 

Also, you can build ghettos. We live in a society"
3788,"If you've ever had the inclination to be a horrible politician and torture your citizens with bad policies and zoning plans, then this game is for YOU!"
3789,"This is the greatest city builder of all time. It has some issues, but only because it's such a huge complex game, and most of them are solved with free mods.
Lot's of DLC, some worth it, some not, but the base game is amazing just on it's own."
3790,"dlGreat game, addictive and great fun even without any DLC"
3791,Great game. I love tedious and challenging games and this is one of them.
3792,it gud
3793,"I'm in my late 60's and hopefully I'll be playing this in my eighties.
One of my favourites.😃.
"
3794,"game is great, #simcitysucks
"
3795,SimCity's younger brother that turned out so much better.
3796,this is a great game that makes all the fun of Simcity happen in 64 bit as well as adding new features that really make you want to keep playing. I enjoy this more thanI should I think but imma keep playin it!
3797,cities skylines good game
3798,Learnt how to plan a city and manage traffics from this game
3799,great game
3800,It's good!
3801,"great game, the world is your oyster."
3802,l
3803,"The graphics are awesome and the simulation works really good, all parts of the city are functional and very realistic. It really pushes your imagination and planning capabilities, endless hours of fun"
3804,"I find this game terrifically relaxing. It is everything that I used to love about sim city, and everything I wish it had."
3805,"This is a fun game with a deep trip down the city-building rabbit hole, if one wants to travel."
3806,"cured my depression
"
3807,I got so into this game that I started looking up city/urban planning methods..
3808,"When I get bored of my racing and FPS and RPG games, I like to pick up CS and just get lost.

It's amazing what people can do with this game and the workshop offerings."
3809,"City Skylines is my favorite game on Steam. My only complaint is that I spent 139 hours on a city and it was deleted when a Windows update went wrong. I had thought that I had enabled cloud saving, but apparently I hadn't. So anyways, be careful of that. Otherwise, I love this game. (But I think that may just be how my brain works.)"
3810,"this is not civilization nor any form of combat rts. just throwing that out there...its a "" chill"" sim where you panic at everything until you are hundreds of hours in and finally understand the game...also the mod support is INCREDIBLE.."
3811,Highly addictive
3812,so u need a lot of ram to run mods but apart from that its sick 16/16gbs of ram for me
3813,This game has potential but On PC it is pure garbage had an issue with my sewage pipe not working had power had piping and still wouldn't work the animations don't work the power grid system is stupid beyond belief i put a whole row of power lines on one side and it only powers one side of a road this game needs huge amounts of updates no options to put power lines underground (which is what a lot of cities do that are modern) a huge huge dissapointment
3814,the game can't be launched after i upgrade to win11. Can anyone help?
3815,best city simulation ever!
3816,Best city builder! Very fun! Like simcity but better! great graphics!
3817,Fantastic game! Addicting but so fun!
3818,5 stars

3826,It's pretty good.
3827,excellent wind-down and relax game after a busy week.

3829,Best City building Game
3830,Ok
3831,city
3832,"A great strategic game, and a good one for passing time!"
3833,its good
3834,"very good game,mos reality game"
3835,"I love how I can micro manage this game! It's like building a country and its economy rather than just another city building game... I hope there is an expansion for Seaports and Cargo Ships, where I can layout my own docks and port area, like how they did a more detailed take on the Airports DLC"
3836,"great for mind-developing
"
3837,"Amazing game, I have been playing it on my xbox since 2017 and now have it on pc."
3838,pretty cool game ngl
3839,i make cool city. traffic sucks
3840,Yes
3841,I don't usually do reviews of games. But this game is worth it. It's starting to show its age so would be awesome to see a squeal to this game.
3842,City: sky line
3843,good

I love this game so much and i love how I can build the city of my dreams, I also love the modding community I recommend getting this game is so much fun. And you can make a poop volcano, sooo very good game lol.
"
3846,Its a really good city building game.
3847,Best city builder ever made
3848,Great game to get stuck into when life's got ya F**ked
3849,Nice
3850,m
3851,love it
3852,With the large amount of DLC I find the game a great way to lose track of an hour or so. Some maps with the disasters turned on provide notable challenges.
3853,Best game ever
3854,a bigger scale sim city but without sims :)
3855,"It's pure zen.
So satisfying and relaxing watching your city grow from tiny houses into towering skyscrapers. Once your city is big enough you can just sit back, marvel at your creation and watch the money roll on in.

There'll be that one resident who complains the taxes are too high.
Bulldoze their house so they won't bother you anymore.
You own these streets, they just live here!"
3856,"I suffer from Autism.

This game is amazing.

Get it.

Only Complaint: Need cheaper DLC bundles.

DLC/10"
3857,E
3858,EPIC
3859,So much to do and so much potential that is unlocked with mods and assets. 1000% will keep playing this game
3860,Amzing game
3861,"its fun can be really difficult at times because of crippling debt
"
3862,"The creativity, realisem, and quality are astounding."
3863,The ultimate city builder. Roll on Cities 2!
3864,road = traffic = pain = mods = ram = pc = exploding
3865,Its just such a fun game
3866,"I really enjoy the gameplay. Initially, I had great difficulty getting my city started without going bankrupt, but there's an abundance of tutorial options in the game, as well as a very helpful online community on Steam and Youtube that helped me get started. 

The DLC is actually worth buying, too! Unlike so many other games, where DLC is weak and overpriced, Cities: Skylines actually offers more than I expected with each pack I've purchased. (I plan on buying more as well!). The variety of maps each offer their own challenges, and I like that the Steam workshop offers even more customizables to add to your game (like building style, for example).

 I do recommend this game to anyone who enjoys a game that you can get sucked into, but that is also low-stress and enjoyable. I highly recommend to casual and intense gamers alike!"
3867,"This game is highly addictive, buy it on sale with a bunch of DLC and you'll have a great time. Remember to buy Natural Disasters DLC if you want to cause chaos, the base game doesn't have it. You can easily soak hours into playing, make sure you have a lot of free time as it's not a very good game to play for short periods of time."
3868,for some reason this game has an error and can't be opened I'm very disappointed even though my laptop has specifications that support it
3869,j
3870,"This game is addictive simply because there is unlimited space for improvements in your city. With or without mods, it is just a perfect city-building game."
3871,good
3872,Very fun
3873,Another computer stress test from Paradox.
3874,"If I start playing this game I 100% won't do anything else for weeks, maybe months. It was fine when I was an unemployed student, now that I have a full time job, it's a little bit more problematic."
3875,pretty boring
3876,sucks
3877,city gmre
3878,this game is just awesome i just love it
3879,"Super fun game! Mods make it better, hopefully #2 comes out with some additions from the community :)"
3880,Awesome game
3881,I cannot speak for expansions but I played when it first came out.  I love it!  I learned so much about city building... and when I drive around the USA today I laugh at the morons who design it.  Round-a-bouts for life.
3882,q
3883,"This is what the latest Sim City should have been.  The only bad thing I have to say about this game is in regards to how it's chopped up into so many DLCs.  It's not a model I'm a fan of, but if you can get everything bundled at a discount during a sale (or something like Humble Bundle like I did (still available as of me writing this)) then its worth it.

Pro tip:  If you load a city up and see some of the textures disappear for buildings or roads at certain zoom distances, load the city again immediately and it should clear it up."
3884,"As a long time city-builder player, this is the best city-builder ever. The workshop and mods add a lot to the game as well as a few DLC's. Taught me a great deal about urban planning and the pleasure of a great public transit."
3885,"love this game, full of trial and error, if it doesn't work build another area make it better. base game is great plus all the mods, created assets and a helpful community makes it by far the best city builder ever created. Play this game to your hearts content and if you get bored with it get the realistic population mod, it is a game changer itself."
3886,"Simulation games make my mind go numb, very fun!"
3887,amazing game too bad it glitched a lot !!
3888,"I got it from Humble Bundle and I want my dollar back.

It crashes when attempting to start a new game."
3889,A very enjoyable time fixing traffic and urban planning.

3898,I love making my citizens slowly perish is my depressing shit hole (literally) of a city
3899,
3900,decent fun
3901,Game is good for those with unlimited imagination and creativity.
3902,"A nice, chill game. Always great to build cool looking cities, although it tends to take a while before you can get the buildings you want, which makes starting new games a bit of a chore. Best not to start a new game unless you have basically filled the whole map."
3903,great
3904,yes
3905,truly fun to play and build cities.
3906,OPEN FORMAT
3907,"I had been waiting to buy this game for at least a year, unfortunately I couldn't afford it until now. I'm having so much fun, both in vanilla and modded versions of this game! It's just challenging enough while still being relaxing. I highly recommend this game if you're unsure about it."
3908,gey
3909,"I like it. I don't know why I like it, but I like it."
3910,addicting
3911,i tink this game put bitkoin miner in my p c .....
3912,great game way better with mods
3913,yeah
3914,"Great city builder, has a lot of DLC and can be very expensive to get involved in. If you can find a good bundle worth it. The base game is fun alone, but the DLC adds so much more."
3915,yes 10/10
3916,Was to complicated
3917,it g4u
3918,just as good as sim city 3000 but better visuals
3919,"Although it might be hard once you start, once you get the hang of it then you can have a giant city like any other giant city! Perform your way with cheats to build your city of your dreams without any limitations, except the border. Or be in regular no cheats mode and work your way up from there but with limitations."
3920,"Brilliant and therapeutic, I've spent many ours creating and running my own little cities, making a perfect little utopia for my citizens to get lost in! Would definitely recommend."
3921,good stuff
3922,City
3923,.
3924,"I've always been a fan of City Simulators. This game takes what I loved about the previous contenders in the market space and makes it... realistic is not the right word, but closer to it."
3925,"With the right Mods, this game turns from a Very good City Builder, into a GODLY City builder. Always have fun going around my towns/cities!"
3926,I got this game 5 days ago
3927,Best game lmao
3928,Best Builder ever
3929,I Burned My City Down Because I Left For 5 Minutes

3943,"great

3944,"It is a good game, because it is very fun and strategic. And i love it. I recommend. :D"
3945,It's kinda hard but ive been having SO much fun
3946,Was messing around with the dam stuff so I could get more power and I look back at my city and every building is either abandoned or there is a dead body in it. Turns out I backed up the water so the polluted water got into the drinking water. 10/10 Would get my citizens to drink brown water again :)
3947,"
Really good city builder great for beginners and really fun to play and watch your city grow"
3948,chaosjane likes
3949,if you are good a making cities and being a popular mayor this is the game for you
3950,"This Game is just fantastic, the game play, the detail, just marvelous. It's also educational because you learn how to run a city of a budget, you learn how to make money with the shops and industrial areas and you also learn how to invest into things that are important for your city to stay alive. The detail is also fantastic. For a game that's from 2015 these graphics are astonishing and highly detailed. It's not that bad to run because I've been playing it on my Laptop and it works flawlessly. Very good game. I definitely recommend this game."
3951,fun
3952,"I must have an amazing K/D ratio in this game, which isn't good"
3953,"Amazing for a 2015 game, though it has some old flaws and missing features that everyone would love to see, yet those can be fixed or obtainable with mods from the workshop. Overall, a good game, slightly overpriced including all the DLCs, but still fun to play."
3954,"Paradox has my gonads in an iron fist and I love it. Highly recommend, especially if you can get everything on a big sale."
3955,This game is one of the games you just keep coming back to after playing other games. Something just eases your mind and calms your soul when playing. There is always something new to try and a better way to build your perfect Utopia.
3956,"Spent 5% of the time actually managing my city, the other 95% of the time managing traffic.

8/10 best traffic manager game of our time."
3957,"In love with this game! Built up a magnificent eco seaside paradise full of hippies and lentils, and nature paths galore. There was no crime and everyone was extremely educated and rich. And they loved the outdoors. But they weren't smart enough to prevent what came next.

I had to go to bed eventually, so the town saw its first earthquake. That should've been a sign, but they didn't take heed. Not my fault they didn't think to appease the Divine Cursor in the Sky.

The emergency services were soon swallowed by mysterious sinkholes. The island amphitheater was buried by a mega tsunami, out of nowhere, and the water made nice little lakes of the sinkholes. People were starting to get concerned. They whined a bit on the in-game Twitter wannabe. I hated their wining.

Four hundred meteorites later, the whining stopped. Population zero. Glorious, restful peace.

With the town now dead, I got back to the real core of the game: building monorails and beautiful highway interchanges.

Someday the town will repopulate. But they will not see evidence of what happened here. I built a statue in remembrance, but they will just think it's some famous dead guy. Little do they know... his face, forever cemented in abject horror, was meant as a warning. Nobody pays attention to history. Nobody remembers SimCity 2000.

Someday the lentils will return. Someday the meteors will too.
Until then, this monorail is looking really good."
3958,"When de Amogus Iz Sus, Amon Gus Burbger"
3959,Excellent and easy to understand.
3960,"I have 100s of hours in this game on console so my hours here dont do it justice, its just one of those games that make you smile as your little city just slowly comes to life."
3961,"Incredible city builder and simulator. Great depth in the game with a fantastic community to complement it. Ultimately the community is what brings a greater depth to the game, especially with its modding, second to none. I strongly recommend this game to anyone that likes realism."
3962,yeee
3963,"Many layers of micro-management for my ocd, Joy!"
3964,I liked that you can build cities in your own creative way.
3965,"- Buys the game
- Plays for 20 mins
- Can't manage the city and already broke
- Download GTA V Map
- Solve existing issues in Los Santos
- Game Complete?! 

Got it for like $2-3 dollars via that last sale so worth it !!!! Regional pricing FTW"
3966,"I originally bought Cities through the XBOX games app, not knowing it was a watered down version. I didn't know that until abou t50 hours of gameplay when I decided mods would be cool... Can't do that with the XBOX app. So I bought the game and expansions AGAIN on Steam. This game is that freaking good. GET. IT."
3967,Its the best city game
3968,everything i love sandbox games and if you like sandbox games you should play this game too
3969,"Best city builder by far, but $700+ in DLCs is a stupid amount of money to spend"
3970,This game redeemed the sins of SimCity 3 and 4. Any city layout you try will run into traffic problems. Watching 10 million vids did not help me fix early-mid game traffic issues. There are billions of DLC and thousands of mods.
3971,"Amazing city building game, can't stop playing"
3972,Yes.
3973,"It's a very good game, I'm just shit at it. :,)"
3974,GIRL YES
3975,The full customization of the game is so fun to play with.
3976,"Good way to kill an afternoon
"
3977,Best City building game ever - sorry sim city
3978,"If you are looking to buy this game, do it!
There is many DLCs that are just amazing and fun which just makes the game more funn. You can't get bored with it, there is workshop with ton of mods.
After all, game is amazing and fun. :)"
3979,"VERY GOOD, ALOT OF HOURS PLAYED!"
3980,aqwder
3981,Satisfying and fun. A good game to spend the time.
3982,"After all the praise this game has received already, I don't really think this needs saying, but here you go anyway. This is debatably the best city building game ever made, the only real contest it has being Simcity 4. Design your city layout, manage traffic, set up an unrivalled public transit network, build an industrial empire and create luxurious parks - then watch from afar as your masterpiece either crumbles from poor road design or lack utilities, or flourishes and rakes in profit. The game is just addicting for all the right reasons and the community, content creators and modders are the cherry on top. It's not without its flaws; some of the buildings are stuck between wanting to be realistic and cartoony, public transit has some bizarre behaviour and there's some features that come from either DLC or mods that should be in the base game. The DLC is a bit pricey, but wait for a sale or look online and you can pick up everything for a very reasonable price. Overall, though there are quite a few nitpicks that can be made about the game in its current state, I have no doubt there's great joy to be had for most management or city building enjoyers."
3983,fun game.
3984,foxfoxfoxfoxfoxfox
3985,I enjoy Cities: Skylines though I am bad at it. Would definitely recommend it if you like a chill city builder!
3986,Great and Fun designing game
3987,I very cool developing game with unique features and options.
3988,"Intuitive gameplay and fun to play!  However I wish you could demolish items (through right click) while in building mode, most of the time though you must exit building mode and enter demolish mode to remove items and government buildings in your path.  A warning would be prudent when demolishing government buildings so a mistake is not made, but it would simplify game play and reduce mouse clicks."
3989,yes
3990,One of those games you just keep coming back to.
3991,i really like this game because you can do almost anything and really let your imagination take over although that is great the DLC is completely broken
3992,"Great game with core dlc's, but not worth the money for the full game and dlc's. Got it on a humble bundle, everything for $25, only way I'd recommend getting it"
3993,So much to do and enjoy in this game.  From designing the city to just watching the traffic and sims go about their business.  I'm obsessed!
3994,amazing but i want it to be more realistic as in i want roads to take time to get built. i want the pipes to close roads while being installed...
3995,thats nice for this time or grim reaper time for this thing for citys kcylnies
3996,Pretty dope
3997,Logged a lot of hours into this. Not sure what is real anymore. 10/10.
3998,pretty fun be sure to mod it for extra fun
3999,hell yes
4000,Wow great horror game! A lot of jump scare!!!!!!!!!!
4001,ye
4002,"Lots of hours in. Vanilla, it's a fun game albeit it gets boring a little quickly. With the right mods it's bsolutely fantastic and playable over and over again - almost a different game! Recommend Biffa's mod list from Youtube to optimize. Some of the expansion packs felt less than necessary and I found they didn't add enough to justify the purchase price, but to each their own. Without mods? 7/10. With Mods 10/10."
4003,:)
4004,it is a hood game and helps you learn about how city's run and work. And it is fun to play.
4005,EVERY THINK ABOUT THIS I LIKES :)
4006,"This game is probably the best city building ""simulator"" there is, with plenty of tools available to make some awesome looking, and great running cities. One issue, is the price of the DLCs and the limited gameplay without some of the essential ones. I would only purchase this if it and most of the DLC are on sale. Another bonus of this game is the extensive player-created content on the workshop that you can use, thousands upon thousands of assets and mods to use at your will, some of which are definitely must haves, such as TMPE and Node-MultiTool."
4007,"Thank you Kanye, very cool!"
4008,video game
4009,"Very good game but it has expensive dlcs that have basic game functions like for example natural disasters, green energy, building parks. Also, the game is a bit complicated so I recommend watching tutorials"
4010,awesome
4011,I didn't respect my terrain...
4012,fun
4013,"Highly addictive and fun gameplay. Always something to do, always another new problem to take care of, always a new idea on how to improve. 40 hours in, I can recommend to give it a few tries (your first attempt will lead to bankruptcy fast, start small)."
4014,nice ig
4015,"Best city building simulators at this moment compared to the others. The key word ""to the others"" because there is no competitors and in scale of genre its very bad. Game have its own flaws like outdated graphics, dumb AI and the worst is lack of content in base game.
Like in the other Paradox game at first you buy the engine and after it you need to buy the rest of the car. Despite all this i would recommend buying this game and at the end there is always Steam Workshop that will help you with lack of content if you don't want spend any money."
4016,amazing game
4017,this game is addicting as shit
4018,Committed some war crimes. 10/10
4019,Amazing Game!
4020,"Sim City failed so bad as a 3D city simulation that someone else decided to create it. Better in every way than Sim City was.

Not free of problems and the complexity might not be for everyone. But this is by far the best city simulation I have played so far."
4021,HI
4022,its fun also I like building cities and flooding them
4023,k
4024,"Fun, addictive, amazing graphics. Everything SimCity used to be before they dumbed their game down. This title will keep me going for years."
4025,"I payed £3 for this game on offer and Epic Games released it for free 24 hours later :((((
in all seriousness don't buy everything's locked behind DLC."
4026,"I like it just fine but there needs to be more story and some kind of goals to reach besides unlocking buildings. It feels empty. When you go in the red, you just keep getting deeper in red there is no ""GAME OVER"" screen and there should be but also would love to have incentive. It just feels so basic and after a while it gets boring because there is no story and a lot of the content is lackluster."
4027,So fascinating!
4028,good
4029,It's a fun game :)
4030,It's a very fun game. I would like for them to provide more features on the base game and not launch a new DLC every time there is something new.
4031,great game!
4032,This game is amazing. The graphics are decent. The gameplay is awesome. Time flies when you play this game.
4033,tsunami mish mash
4034,"As I am constrained by a tiresome work, this game allows me to set my own pace, as a game that unfolds at the speed I am willing to play before I pass out sleeping"
4035,:)
4036,Noice
4037,If you were a fan of the original SimCity games this is the modern day successor with even more extra playability and superb graphics.  It comes with its own fantastic Steam community support page/workshop and also with plenty of regularly updated new downloadable content for in-game MODs and new Assets to keep you playing for hours and hours.
4038,1 of the best building games ever...
4039,epic game
4040,BEST GAME EVER
4041,"Gave my people free education, went bankrupt.... will play again"
4042,True son of Sim City
4043,"9000 mods
no end in sight"
4044,nice
4045,Addicting
4046,Pretty decent modern rendition of Sim City. It does leave a lot to be desired though because it is one of those games that insists on selling you 1000 DLC's rather than just giving a complete game. The modding community comes to the rescue here though.  Theres no story mode which would have been cool if they had one.
4047,haha traffic
4048,"still learning

4049,Played this once. Never again.

4054,sim city 4 on steroids
4055,yes!
4056,"Still the best city building, traffic managing, why is it 3am?! out there."
4057,Love everthing about this game!
4058,"This is actually a traffic management game masquerading as a Sim City clone.  It's much better than that, and better than it sounds."
4059,AMAZING GAME SO MANY AMAZING MODS AND SMOOTH GAMEPLAY ON BASIC HP
4060,yes good
4061,"I want to like this game because graphically it's great, and the variation and size are there to create thousands of unique playthroughs. The problem is that fundamentally, this game is incomplete unless you drop literally hundreds of dollars on DLC to finish it. So many aspects that should have been built in are instead relegated to paid-DLC that playing the base game really isn't satisfying at all. Sure you can mix and match to get to a playable level, but ultimately, this game ends up feeling more like a scam than a game."
4062,16 POUNDS FOR ALL DLC FROM HUMBLE BUNDLE :DDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD
4063,Actuial time machine. Great game
4064,Tu madre y mi madre tienden la ropa.
4065,"Super fun! I love the challenge of city building, it gets harder the bigger your city becomes!"
4066,lol da best
4067,"This game sucks. After downloading it, it completely ruined my computer and has cost me so much time trying to fix it. Don’t even think about downloading mods, because you download one non compatible mod and your computer stops working. And this game is only decent with the mods. Complete waste of time. Fix your stupid game. No other game has cost me this much time and stress then this trash."
4068,"The kind of game that you intend to play for 1h, then end up playing for 10h."
4069,super fun !
4070,The little dingy noises give serotonin. Much good.
4071,exellent citybuilder
4072,  e
4073,Amazing game that everyone should try!
4074,The best game for building cities!
4075,it dose not open
4076,fklsgldf
4077,HELL YES
4078,Recently fell in love with this on xbox and switched to pc. I hope theres still some time to enjoy before CS2 releases because i am getting DLC like mad lol
4079,How am I supposed to make people come to the houses I build when I have no idea how to build the sewage system and every house has a bunch of shit in it...
4080,"The game itself is really good.  Some of the DLC is lacklustre at best but unless you get them really cheap i wouldn't bother with any of them. Most of the DLC can be done via mod's in some way anyway and what the DLC adds that the mods don't isn't worth the price being asked.  If you can pick up the DLC for cheap (humble for example) i would recommend that, otherwise don't bother and stick with the base game, which is really good anyway"
4081,Good
4082,Fab city builder
4083,Somehow you always want more even if the DLCs are extra dinero.
4084,hehe
4085,Just brilliant!
4086,Engineers rejoice! Architects who?
4087,With mods there is unbelieveble amounts of things you can do in this game just blows my mind I love it
4088,this game fucking sucks
4089,"You like sandbox city building? This is that good shit, right here. Just the fattest traffic lines you've ever seen."
4090,Always been fascinated with maps and city building since I was a kid. Would highly recommend to anyone who is in to these kind of games.
4091,It's somehow very relaxing to micromanage a city.
4092,This game is fun to play if you are into building simulators.
4093,Amazing game.
4094,"*EDIT AUGUST 2022: Game works again! New Graphics Driver did the trick for me.

I actually like the game. However I can't recommend buying the game at its current state since it won't launch anymore. It used to run just fine on my Computer until a few months ago. I tried several proposed workarounds and none of them is working for me, drivers are all updated. If these problems are fixed I'd consider making a positive recommendation."

4097,"Yeah its really good. I recommend strongly if this is your cup of tea the only problem I have with the game is the amount of DLC, but this is an issue with all Paradox games not just CS. But if you are reading this before June 16th, 2022 you can get nearly all the DLC and the game off HumbleBundle for $20 USD which adds a whole lot of stuff. I think i will be playing this game for a long time seeing how I keep finding myself loosing hours starring at buildings being constructed and laughing at all the silly ""chirps"" my citizens post. The base game alone is a solid 7/10 but when you mix some of the really neat and detailed DLC id say its a 9/10 missing one point because the DLC are very expensive buy them on sale if you can wait or get them on HumbleBundle before June 16th, 2022."
4098,I like the depth of play. I'm new here but from what I've seen the play can be forever.
4099,"Too much DLC, but if you like city builders, this is it."
4100,"I can't describe in words how much fun i have had playing this on the PS4 and PC.

Its a 10/10 for me."
4101,"City Skylines..  YES!  

Steam App to Download Mods and Assets and Collections..  No!

Steram App is a dumpster fire."
4102,"Many hours of entertainment, encompassing both complex goals and ridiculous achievements. I've played about 160 hours without any DLC and am still having fun."
4103,"If I ever become a politician, I am just going to show the people my city as my years of experience."
4104,I wish the traffic wasn't so weird... but besides that its been a great game.
4105,E
4106,such good game
4107,"Entra en el TOP 5 mejores juegos que jugué, le falta contenido porque quizas a veces al final se hace un poco monotono, no tanto igual porque siempre inicio otra partida y el ciclo se repite y encuentro algo más.  pero muy bueno. De mis favoritos"
4108,"Build for 4+ hours. Stop playing. Delete the save. Repeat.
Between these steps you add mods and DLCs. 11/10 game"
4109,me likey
4110,I'm the worst mayor ever but I love this game
4111,"A solid staple of city games that enjoyable, simple, and easy to grasp. Hopefully if a Cities Skylines 2  ever comes, we get some form of coop."
4112,It is every bit the game Sim City wished it could be!
4113,fun with mods
4114,Can't play the games without mods; add mods makes the game not start.  Cool system bro.
4115,kinda fun
4116,i like everything about the game
4117,So fun.
4118,I dont understand how poop can kill people but funny
4119,"this game doesn't even work, like at all i try to make a new city, it freezes and then the game justs refused to pop up, even though steam says its running"
4120,game is epic. great fun and . great for chiling whit loth of coffe and cigarets xd.
4121,"it is a good game from what i've heard, but just couldn't run on my old ass pc."
4122,Very Good.
4123,the beast of game of free time
4124,God geme
4125,Good game
4126,"This is my first Steam review, and its a testament to how phenomenal this game is. There has been nothing I've played that more zen than this. I returned to the game after years of hiatus and it sunk it's teeth in deep. The level of granular management is what really makes this THE sim game.

If you love the minutia of city building Skylines takes the cake and then some. There are bunch of DLC packs that add to the experience, however wait for sales because you can usually score a great deal on either some/all combined. + the mod community is so lively that you can find any way to tailor the game to your desired play-style for an added extra level of fun."
4127,"Hypnotic. 

You'll spend hours making the perfect template with just the right zoning ratios. You'll keep everyone healthy, educated, entertained and busy. Then you'll be nothing but a traffic controller for the remainder of that city until you start a new one. Rinse & repeat.

10/10 best traffic management simulator out there"
4128,"A game for making a pretty-ish looking city (to me the buildings feel kinda small and the world feels like it lacks colour)

Unfortunately the city management part of the game is woefully lacking. It's super easy to make a functioning city and have millions in the bank. Everything is too profitable/powerful and there's not really any progression. All progression is based off of population which isn't difficult at all, especially with how much space you have

Perhaps controversially I prefer Sim City V"
4129,El mejor simulador de ciudades
4130,Very Good I can flood a city
4131,10/10 would play again
4132,Best city builder around.
4133,The best game I played on steam
4134,"All I can say is that this game can be dangerously addictive if you are of a certain disposition. You can literally customise and manage every single detail about your city, and the extensiveness of its modding system and rich library of mods and third-party assets (along with all the DLCs for it) means you will be able to build almost any kind of the city of your dreams. 

Highly recommended, but be careful not to get too addicted; remember to regularly take breaks and go outside (lol)."
4135,"Love It, easy going and a whole lot of fun :)"
4136,"Quite complicated to learn how to play, but once you know how to, it's extremely fun. Definitely the best city building game out there right now"
4137,"Played the game for 70+ hours just by learning. Watched some tutorials on how to help grow the city. Played for 10 hours not even realizing and made a 10,000+ city. 
You'll get addicted to it.
Get the dlc on discount, does make the city planning even more fun. I'm gonna pass out."
4138,"It does justice to SimCity2000 in some ways, with more detail, though is less campy and fun!"
4139,"Full price? Absolutely not. $20 on Humble Bundle for the game and 90% of the DLC? Absolutely YES!

Right here my friends:
https://www.humblebundle.com/games/cities-skylines-colossal-collection?partner=ironcladlion"
4140,"good
"
4141,yes
4142,This is easily one of the best city sims out there. I really appreciate all of the content that continues to come out. My only real complaint is it is pretty RAM intensive and my 16gb struggles at times. Especially with workshop content but they can't plan for the custom content. So I highly recommend!
4143,"Buggy, Sluggish even on a budget gaming pc, and above all else the dang bird wont shut up. company is predatory with your data. forces you to agree to who even knows what. they want your phone number, address etc. learning curve is heavy, you can become incurably in debt in the early and late game. no balance. they just keep adding dlc's bc a large portion of the consumer base mods themselves into god mode or whatever. dont waste your time or money or data"
4144,"I be hooked. 
Reason why i be hooked is i like it."
4145,great city planner
4146,w
4147,The perfect city builder imo
4148,city build very good
4149,cool game almost as cool as monkey ball (unsuper)

4153,Very entertaining and enjoyable!
4154,"I just keep coming back to Cities Skylines as the base city builder. Sim City is nowhere near this quality, Maxis is dead, long live Colossal Order. 

The best thing about Cities Skylines: mod support. The sheer amount of fantastic mods and assets out there is amazing. There are mods to support mods; just sayin'. Dev teams just cannot produce the dedication of enthusiasts due to the monetization and required quality control: mod support was the best outcome here. And there are some fantastic people out there creating awesome assets and mods. I can spend hours watching the fascinating traffic if you change the chaos with TMPE or try to build a good looking waste management facility. 

The worst thing about Cities Skylines: it's a Paradox game. That means your data is for grabs, you get a useless launcher so they can grab even more data to sell and you get their standard DLC treatment. But luckily the game itself is very much enjoyable, and the DLCs also add nice stuff. Some are much better than others of course, but I've seen much worse on Paradox games (Prison Architect used to be my favorite - until the added DLCs broke most of the base game) so I'll tip my fedora to CO for their quality DLC builds. 

If you love city builders and you don't have Cities Skylines yet, shame on you (seriously, it's 7 years old now). If you are thinking about trying a city builder, this one definitely tops the list. If you have issues with the price, just wait for a sale here on Steam or on Humble Bundle."
4155,Is nice
4156,Very addictive
4157,"When christ parted the red sea for moses , he found amognst the stones cities skylines definitve editionand it was there christ had a new meaning. I would only play this game if you are well versed in deutoronomy and Revelations 1-2:1-39. the dlc are the crystals embedded in this stone so buy them maybe not from steam if your poor, but get them as well and mods for the love of peter"
4158,well.
4159,I love'in it.
4160,Addicting
4161,"★★★★☆

City building at its best

As a kid I played Sim City 3000 and loved it, but Skylines is definitely on another level.  Not a huge fan of DLC system; in my opinion there are too many of them, some of which are a bit too side-tracking.  Limitless possibilities make me spend hours upon hours in a row.  Game allows to build your city in a variety of ways -- some districts can focus on efficiency, others on aesthetics, and some can even be a nice mix of both.  May write another review after 100 hours and trying out some mods."
4162,shit canal
4163,ye
4164,"Cool game if you got an eye for detail, and the patience."
4165,Fun game - not a real simulation but nice game balance for even a casual player
4166,"This game is amazing and very fun, I highly recommend this to players who love accounting and using their brain to the max!"
4167,I enjoy the game overall - there are some things that frustrate me and being a newbie it is hard to find help. Glad there are forums and a community.
4168,Good fun
4169,"A pretty entertaining game! My city of about 20ish thousand gets pretty glitchy, but other then those few bugs I highly recommend"
4170,"Thoroughly enjoy this game, would play a lot more if the DLC didn't cost so much"
4171,i built a wall around my city and claimed it as a independent nation
4172,"Awesome. Crashes from time to time, but that's only when you have too many files. LOL:)"
4173,The game you play is as shallow or as deep as you want it to be. Want to worry about every tree in your city? You have the tools for that. Want to paint bucket districts and make square cities? Go for it.
4174,its good
4175,lots of fun. sooooo many mods you can download from the workshop. best city building game ever
4176,recommend it
4177,"Bought the game and some DLC, i regred it, Crashes frequently, when the game gets a bit more interesting (larger = crash) or just on a new game, or hangs on save... its so unstable it amazes me it was released, 
Got lots of CPU power lots of RAM, creates crash dump, no in game option to send a crash dumps automatically, forums full of what to do, but in the end...

 its just all crap this game DONT BUY IT ! 

- They dont fix things never seen updates for it. that says it all..."
4178,Allows For Great Creativity!
4179,goodf
4180,Better than any other city-building game!
4181,Most fun I've had in years with a city builder. Years of content and a huge workshop.
4182,Very addicting city builder with lots to do !
4183,"The game is very good, but you MUST be a modder in order to make anything beautiful"
4184,I mde my cty that maks peole dissaper
4185,"The best city-building simulator on the market, period."
4186,"Pretty good game i Loved it 
But if u download tooo many workshop mods/assets and if u have a bad pc like me (i5 4590/gt710) It take 20-30 mins to load or just crashes while loading but 
It is a really good game"
4187,"190 hours in and I still suck at building a screenshot-worthy city.
See you at 500 hours."
4188,It is very uwu saranghae also addicting
4189,best game ever i made so much towns
4190,"I have many many more hours than the 276 that steam has logged. I've played this for hours upon hours on my switch and PS4 and XBXS. Probably looking at closer to 500 hours of playtime, and I'd like to tell you why. 

If you are anything like me and absolutely tweak out on simulation games, then this is absolutely the game for you. More than 50% of my hours logged are the vanilla version of the game. Even WITHOUT DLC this games is just perfect. The level of control you get is absolutely ridiculous, I can spend hours perfecting an aesthetically pleasing interchange, upgrading my roads to better fit my traffic flow, rezoning to keep industrial traffic isolated from private vehicle traffic,  and providing alternative travel options, deciding whether you want your city to be a blue collar industrial complex, tech savvy microchip pushers, fishing town, small farming village, or a complete tourist trap. It's all up to you and how you want your city to be! Hell, you can even expand enough yo have all of the above, completely isolated from one another, and connecting each piece with highways that just make sense. There is ALWAYS something to do, and this game provides limitless entertainment, so if you are on the fence about this game for some reason, THIS IS YOUR SIGN. BUY THE EFFING GAME< IT""S WORTH EVERY SINGLE PENNY>"
4191,"been having a loooot of fun coming back to this, very relaxing as well to play."
4192,"If you feel like going down in the rabbit hole of time, prepare to be addicted. This game is a blast."
4193,mid asf
4194,"I just wanna say in my first 24 hours of playing every time I got my people poison and die no matter how hospital I have.. remember its ALWAYS THE WATER PUMPS AND PIPES CONNECTED!

RIP my 3 cities worth of 3 saving games .."
4195,"I'm in love with this game
"
4196,was able to rename gorilla to harambe 10/10
4197,"The best example of ""Just a few more minutes..."" before it turns into a few more hours.

This game is drugs. You will not put it down once you start playing. Expect to sit in your chair for hours cradling your city like it's your only child. You'll have moments where you might consider bankruptcy because you accidentally plagued your citizen's with toxic drinking water, realized you placed the dam the wrong way and cause a massive tsunami, or maybe your traffic is so backed up that the firefighters can't get to that burning building in time.

This game is a lot of trial and error, but it's great at being fun while you screw everything up. Then you pick up pieces here and there from your failures until you make a bustling metropolitan city. Once you have that, it'll be all worth it in the end.

It's definitely worth every penny. The best city sim out there.

(P.S my play count should be much higher. I've played on multiple consoles and different game launchers)"
4198,Its Goods
4199,i like this game
4200,"Buying this game from the humble bundle with 30 dlcs for $20 was absolutely worth it, I'll probably be playing this game on and off for a while. 

HB deal ends June 9th, so if you're reading this and considering buying then go there instead of buying through steam, you will save A LOT of money. And donate to charity while you're at it, so you can get your good boy points, too."
4201,"You want a standard city?  Do it.  You want a city that's trying to 'modernize' while also farming and logging?  Make it.  You want a city so you have an excuse for your 'watching windmills spin in the sunset' habit?  You can grow a city just to keep you in windmills! Tourist city?  Prison city?  City which starts off polluting like a pigsty and harvesting oil until the oil runs out...then converts to green energy and watches the pollution eventually clear up over time? You can.  This is such a fun game, prepare to see things in real life that make you want to go work on your road system in the game."
4202,Grinded for 15 hours straight to get 40k population then lost them all to a tsunami
4203,I built a lake of human feces and it flooded the city
4204,"I wanted a game to get rid of the sims dlc hulla ballo- just to get this game that i previously didnt know had any dlc and its just as bad. This game is lovely, but it controls like an indie game, where they havent quite figured out games yet, with a janky saving system and a triple A dlc price. It just doesnt add up
"
4205,Sim City killer
4206,Best city building game available. So much fun. So much content. Endless ways to build and update the cities of your dreams.
4207,the best city builder ive ever played. give it a try :)
4208,I made a road and now it is jammed. 10/10 game get traffic mods or you will die
4209,build gam. very col and recomend to everyone. u get ur bang for ur buck. buy now
4210,g
4211,Addicting!
4212,very good needs some DLC but a great game otherwise
4213,"Amazing game, you can kill hours in that maze! The tools and mechanics are pretty cool

A thing I dont like is:
Bus/Metro/Train/Airport's mechanics to make a station. Instead to click like a crazy man, just would be better just to choice where to have stations, and game do automatic everything else."
4214,City :)
4215,"Best City Sim there is probably. Intuitive and easy to understand. Traffic management can get difficult at times but I enjoy it. If some aspect of the game bothers you there is most likely a workshop mod to fix it which is really nice. i.e. I got sick of destroying abandoned buildings, there is a mod for it. Great game really."
4216,it's all about traffic efficiency... beautiful beautiful traffic efficiency
4217,Just added a positive review

4223,Mega relaxing :D
4224,best city builder of all. i can't make cities past the population of 30000 but it's still very good
4225,Fun and relaxing game
4226,"I play this game on fun mode, turn on infinite money/whatever and just build a city on a map. It is very relaxing and the city that springs up is beautiful and amazing. There is a game mode, it is semi-easy but has a bit of a learning curve that once you get, you get. If only real civil engineering were so easy. But yeah, my hour count is low but since it is triple digit and therefore way more cost effective than other forms of entertainment, I figured I'm entitled to have an opinion on this game. If you like simulators, this one hits the spot."

4228,Best city bulder ever.
4229,i like geim:)
4230,"Fun, challenging, addictive Community driven with lots of free workshop content to help expand and enhance your city projects well beyond the base game (vanilla). Reasonably priced from the basic game through all of the add on's and enhancements. Lot's of challenges to cope with and occupy you, as you try and grow your cities to the max."
4231,cool good add monkeys
4232,Great game but expensive to have all dlc
4233,"The game is super fun, and then I lose all my progress because of a corrupted file. $30 dollars wasted, waste of time and effort, make the game free as it has DLC's that cost way too  money. A game that is this much money should not have save issues. I would rather watch paint dry than play again"
4234,"Absolute must for City Builder fans. Number One without a doubt to date! 

Modding is a jungle though (although I am new to mods)"
4235,"Great way to kill some time. Its just one of those games you see in your library at 2am and go ""eh why not.."" next thing you know you've been playing for 8 hours straight, going to bed at 10 in the morning, and ruining your sleep schedule for the week. All for a virtual city... And worth it :)"
4236,Very fun and diffrent game! Buy the bundle on humblebundel for 19 euros. 8 days left as off june 7
4237,9/10
4238,"Very engaging game. I was initially doubtful about it but as you get the grips, things get more and more entertaining, specially with DLCs"
4239,Its a lot of fun. Can play for hours.
4240,"i love this game, maybe in base rn isn't best, but after add few mods from steam workshop work well!"
4241,great game the best
4242,"Having played this previously on console, I was excited to try it on PC. There is much more in-depth controls on here and so many workshop items to make this game even better.
Absolutely love this game, reminds me of the old Simcity days before one of them crashed my PC (not mentioning which, you know though aha).
Would absolutely recommend to anyone looking to scratch that city builder itch."

4250,"Great game, even without dlc´s the mods make up for it."
4251,"Great and fun gameplay, but a bug( I placed an incinator in my small industrial zone) put me from Big Town( 5.500 population) to just 2.200, my suburbs near a farm I built were gone and the farm in question went from 4-5 stars to 1 star"

However, none of them seem to work I am out of ideas to try and fix my game"

4266,"looks like a ps1 game, doesnt explain things well enough, played for 19 minutes and give up not good for people with adhd i dont have time to read just let me play i dont want to learn things im not in school anymore 1/10"
4267,its realy fun
4268,"My experience with Cities: Skylines has been mixed. Don't get me wrong, the game is everything it says it is and it delivers to be a city builder with great depth and city building. However, I find it hard to get into the game. I've played this game for over 200 hours, knowing that it's a great game, but I only find myself starting a new city every time I open it up because I left the game for a week and am no longer interested in what I was doing before. This might be something about me, but I don't really have this experience with other games, so I would just make sure that when you buy this game you are sure you won't force yourself to play it because then it isn't fun. Overall, 4/5, perfectly made game, just a bit hard to get into for me."
4269,"Very fun and kind of addicting. But after playing it for a long time it can begin to feel endless and too much,
unless you like those aspecs of a game.

No bugs/glitches
A ton of fun mods
A game you can really grind"
4270,"Great game if you just want to relax and build a nice city, then it grows and becomes increasingly stressful because of random stupid problems that crop up and you can't do anything about without creating 50 others.

amazing game for people who like to micro manage"

4274,Love it! Must have for anyone that likes planning cities!
4275,Love the details and all that you can do.
4276,One of the best city building games. Some of the mods are a bit complex to learn but it's worth the effort.
4277,I love this game.
4278,"Game engine is starting to show its age, and the devs should 100% begin working on a sequel or major update rather than pushing more DLCs. There's just no competition in the city-builder genre though, and the modding community is just too good."
4279,"It's either extreme casual or extreme hardcore, a real shame it's not multiplayer. One of the best city sim games around."

4287,So much fun and endless possibilities when it comes to creating your city
4288,Different every time you play.
4289,"I bought this game on sale because I had played it before on console and it wasn't $30, but after playing over 100 hours I would totally pay full price and get a few dlc packs. It's time-consuming in a good way and I am always busy doing something different in the game. Only 2 things bothered me, #1 you can only buy 9 tiles to build on. I found a mod on the workshop page that gets me all 25. #2 not all the dlc packs work. I bought the train station dlc pack for $5 and it doesn't connect with the original game. Just make sure to read the reviews before buying the dlc pack.
I give Cities Skylines 4 out of 5 stars."
4290,"yes
"
4291,"I fall back to this game all the time but I always get end up at the same place.. I love the game, it needs mods to be fun but here is my issues with the game. 

(but i still enjoy it and as I said, with mods its fun and playable)

- I cant find a mod or way to know WHO need WHAT kind of - lets say industry. 
I wanna know if my new commerce area needs more of x industry.  
I wanna know if the residential area need commercial - what kind (size) .. not just that the city needs it. 

I know there is mods that make it so it should only deliver to one or more areas and so on but I hope u understand my issue

- I cant get the game to make me loose. I get cash, a lot of cash.. I haven't yet got any issues with trying to get by. Sure the economy will sometimes get a hit and go down hill for a while because the traffic gets stupid and no one can get help, but after a (mod)- despawn its all good again ( hard mode no vehicle despawn).
Building a metro line should be stupid expensive and be a late-game feature in my opinion,

- I get to long trains, and to many, they clog up the system and it all comes to a halt. (i have mods to prevent this but.. still).

So i play a map until i get 150k residents, then it gets boring. 

I got these DLS:
- Green cities
- Mass transit
- Snowfall
- After dark
- Delux edition

Maybe I just haven't found the mods that fits my needs but.."
4292,Entertaining. Great for passing time.
4293,I left the game for 3 months because it was hard and than realised that there was an unlimited money option. Great game overall! Played it only for a bit.
4294,Here my dick shaped city is very popular.
4295,"Very nice game.
I first got the game for free (Ehre) from the Epic store but the mod support was shit there.
Therefore i got the game on steam to get better mod support and a few DLCs.
The game is awesome and you can play it for 10 hours straight (or gay) without getting bored.
The DLCs are quite expensive but some are definitely worth the money (like ""Mass Transit"").
Amazing game if you are looking for a not too stressful city-building simulator with a focus on traffic control.

I recommend the mods Network Multitool (https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2560782729), Traffic Manager PE (https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1637663252), Node Controller (https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2472062376), Fine Road Tool (https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1844442251), Move It (https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1619685021)  for HEAVILY improved road desing and the Intersection Marking Tool (https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2140418403) for nice intersection design."
4296,"Very good, very nice."
4297,"Easy to learn, hard to master simulation game with chill soundscapes and cute visuals. Partially bonkers. It's one of these games that you play for hours on end and then let go of for a couple of months. it's really fun

4303,"Great game, it keeps you interested and you can go as far and complex as you want. I recommend getting all the DLCs. That is really expensive, but there's a great deal on Humble Bundle, where you get all DLCs (including base game). I am not affiliated with Humble Bundle, it's just a perfect deal. Just make sure you're quick, the bundle will end in 10 days"
4304,mmmmm Cititess
4305,Adictive. very fun if your creative and love managing shit
4306,"Despite Paradox's insistence that you, the customer, be nickle & dimed for every cent you have, this is the only City-Builder that you will ever need. It doesn't get any better than this. 
"
4307,"This game is flawed and never balance itself. That's mainly why I don't recommend it.
Everything gets out of control at one point. The best example is what's called ""death waves"". At one point it will become absurd and terminate your city (I had my city going from 130k pop to 20k, game over).
Developers are unable to fix this. They rely heavily on what dedicated fans put on the steam workshop.
This game mostly gets cosmetics or unnecessary addon over time, but never gets fixed, never gets useful tools to manage correctly your city (its public transport for instance), never gets ways to improve your road network. They missed the point of what makes a good [u]city builder[/u].
This game gets positives reviews only thanks to what's available on the steam workshop. Otherwise, if you want to play it vanilla, it's a no go.
People bringing mods on the steam workshop deserve your money, not Colossal Order."
4308,"Great game.

Spend way too much time in this game. Played more than it shows, owned previously.

Build city, pollute too much, make new city swearing to never pollute again, fail- polluting again, repeat.

Great thing about this city builder is you can make your own assets, i.e. freeway on and off ramps with over pass all in one. Or an entire 9 block square with roads allowing you to reuse it to have a grid city that is equal size and everything you want fits right inside it.

Bad thing about this city builder? The traffic makes no sense. Random spawns. Always will get congested after a certain population density. Some things you can follow and see them spawn and go to a place, like garbage trucks, police etc. Random people- nope. Watch a car(spawn from nowhere) get on the freeway, drive a long distance, get off the freeway(no buildings at this point) then get back on going the opposite direction. After some time you give up trying to decongest traffic and just build with the largest roads that have trees in the inner city.

You can not leave this game running over night. After your city gets big/old enough you have to bulldoze abandoned/ruined buildings or crime, fire and property value loss happens. There is no way to auto do this, it is tedious.

Yes buy this game. No you do not need expansions, if you want them fine, skip after dark one for sure. Don't beat yourself up over traffic. If you have a woman make sure to take care of everything she wants BEFORE you play, you will find yourself waiting for more cash to come in so you can build just 1 more 9 square blocks of things, or that powerplant you need."

4312,"The game interested in its gameplay: you can build the city you want, anywhere, on any map, with any landscape, road pattern, buildings; As for me, now Cities Skylines is the most developed simulator of all. It seems everything is fine but...

This game doesn't have the right developers to make it good, and it would be worth buying at Steam for a full price. Instead of remaking the game to a new engine (because this one - Unity - can't work properly even with a city of 5000 - 10000 population, more population - game crashes at the loading screen, or loading another save; instead of adding really cool DLC (as in the beginning of the game) add awful airports for $10! So even these game publishers crashed the game into a million different DLC, for VERY HIGH PRICE ($150) that vanilla seems like shit.
Optimization is terrible. Already for 1000 population fps below 60 and this is GTX 1650S + R5 2600. Mods saves if you reduce the details of trees and objects.

Game has a great potential but there are no normal developers and publisher. I do NOT recommend buying in Steam, only the key on another site for $2 or on sale."
4313,"Very good game and the entire DLC collection (besides DLC released in 2022) is available on Humble Bundle for $20 until 16th June.

This is your one chance to not only escape paradox's horrible DLC policy, but also donate to charity too. It is a true win-win."

4320,"Most realistic city design game I've played. The community is one best with large mod support that enhances the game by allowing you to be able find most real world building in some fashion or pre made city parts or added features. Paradox does well the interact with the community and even integrate some of the changes initially that require mods that become extremely popular. I had played SimCity since I was kid, and now as an adult this is the first city design game that truly got me looking up real city design such as grid vs organic layouts and road hierarchies to really create an efficient, busy city. So many possible cities you can create with what Paradox has created along with the number mods available to the game."
4321,cool
4322,It is a grat game
4323,yes
4324,Love the updates!
4325,GREAT
4326,"Great city builder the AI can be dumber then hell at times but mods ""fix it"" with stuff that should be added in game. Other than the AI being stupid its a fun and engaging game with plenty of ways to fix/ improve your city."
4327,Ive played this game for 100 hours and still dont know to design a road system that doesnt break after 5 mins
4328,Make a poop city. Good
4329,Its ok

4344,im too brain dead for this game

4347,fantastic city sim
4348,very detailed game with many things to do
4349,amazing
4350,"I'm sorry but ""go to Youtube"" and ""just mess around with it"" are not acceptable suggestions for tutorials. I don't know where this trend in lazy programming has come from, but if your game is: 1. too complex to actually figure out from trial and error (which this is) and 2. doesn't have even a basic interactive walk-through in game, you don't deserve to have people spend money on your software."
4351,best city builder
4352,I don't like this type of games and every time I play I don't want to stop
4353,Fun game
4354,"Great concept of a game. Just don't add loads of mods...
I have learned that :P"
4355,I don't know what I'm doing
4356,10/10 Couldnt stop playing this game was on it for days
4357,"Finally, a game where I can obliterate traffic through superior design and rampant use of eminent domain"
4358,"Do you want to play a game that simulates what its like to play a game that crashes. Then crash simulator is the game for you, I mean Cities Skylines, this game... Regardless of the type of computer you play this with, or whether you play it vanilla no mods this game will crash on you at some point. 

Reaching out to tech is helpless because you're going to get the same run of the mill answers, put on hold, or talk to a bot. Ive read countless online fourms, watched hours of youtube tutorials, on what to do about this issue, and tried just about every possible solution. Nothing and I mean nothing has helped, except for one thing....

 Wiping out my entire PC, Resetting everything wiping the whole PC clean and starting new. Ive even gone as far as deleting all of my mods and assest to see if that helped and nothing, just the PC reset is the only solution. Ive reset my PC 3 times to get let down trying to run this trash game.

 At this point, I am done giving this game my time, or money for DLCs until this issue is addressed and fixed. Im not the only person experiencing this issue. Im done playing a game, investing time building something only to have my game crash unexpectedly then start over from scratch because i cant even get the game itself to launch without an error code. like no main menu, nothing just (sorry error contact steam click here) nooo im done thanks steam..

 You could build a warehouse data center size PC to run this game and it would still crash on you. They should rename this game the Endless Bummer."
4359,ilikeit
4360,Best city simulation game hands down. The base game by itself is feature complete yet alone adding all the DLCs and scenarios. I can't believe it took me this long to buy this game. Granted now I have so many good mods and youtube content to enjoy :)
4361,"best city builder ever, bar none. the monuments in the end game like eden project, etc kind of ruin the fun but there's no obligation to make any of those. just a really great city builder game, and highly moddable. 10/10"
4362,its fun ig....
4363,yes gg
4364,"Is cities skylines worth getting yes but only if you've got a lot  of time on your hands the problem is it's pretty addictive and trust me when I say the hours flyby on it  I've been up playing till the crack of Dawn and you can put up with games stability issues be warned it is prone to crashing or leading to some unusual stability issues on you pc  an causing the odd hard crash but  despite its faults and issues I would still it’s a good game I would also  highly recommend a pretty good pc with at least 16gb of ram especially if you decide that you don't want to play vanilla and go down the route of running mods  or anything from the workshop here's some tips from my own personal experience the stuff you can get on the workshop  is good there's a pretty wide selection of items from vehicles to themes to new buildings and props but always check first to find out 
when was it last updated?
 is it compatible with every dlc? 
is there any conflicts with other mods?
 what's the size of the mod?
is there any known issues with it?
If it's deprecated or hasn't been updated for a while there could be a conflict issue download the mod and test it or use one of the loading screen mod testers I always keep a written list of all mods I've downloaded as every now an again I delete them and download the ones I want to keep the numbers low this will help the game load quicker as I said I good pc is a must as you'll quickly find that mods eat it up  memory like candy you can create your own collection on the workshop which is another great way to track what mods you have there's plenty to choose from and the modding is still pretty active enjoy and happy building"
4365,"I have this game free in Epic, but decided to buy in steam cuz, I really need mods and assets which is very easy to import."
4366,its a good game because it lets me create a city just how i would want it and its very realistic

4384,"You can get $250 ""worth"" of dlc & base game on humble bundle right now for for $20, and it goes to charity. You'd be stupid not to go buy it there."
4385,"What I like about it is that you can turn the grid, angles etc. on and off whenever you want to, which gives a lot of possibilities for city planning. There's also a lot of different options for industry, economy etc. What I don't like about it is how basic the road connections are. For instance, if there's an intersection and you want to build a smaller road as an exit from road A to road B at an angle that's 90° or lower, you'll have to do this weird W-like shape instead of a simpler, more elegant C shape. You'll have to install third-party mods to get this kind of freedom with intersections, which I dislike because I'd rather play vanilla."
4386,An amazing game with an abundance of content; xqcL

4398,It is strangely addictive planning and watching a city grow.  It is also strangely addictive funneling said city's sewage into a giant volcano and releasing a great flood.
4399,is a very good game
4400,Overall its a really great game. Far better than any other city builder on the market by a large margin. I really enjoy it. Its easy to add mods and there is a lot of workshop content that is amazing for this game. However the price tag is a little much for how little content is in the base game. I would suggest you buy a couple  DLC's for the game if you get it. It also wont be fun if you expect a lot of action. Its more of a simulation. 8/10.
4401,yea
4402,the PS4 version i played before i had my PC was years ago. i still have it but i think PC is better except its not free...

4408,"This game is for computer saavy people.  I cannot fix my game because I have no idea what the problem is,
It said my cloud is out of date,  On my laptop and my pc.  I did what some of the other player said but no luck."
4409,"Ir's a really great game to design a realistic city. It helps you understand traffic routes, zoning, and all of the essentials assets that make a city, a city. I would definitely recommend it to others!"

4411,"Лучший градостроитель со времен SimCity 4, и лучший на данный момент, а с широчайшим ассортиментом модов, многие из которых при этом сделаны на отлично и делают игру в разы удобнее и лучше, но при этом (в отличии от многих других игр) не руинят баланс и атмосферу игры, легчайше - лучший градостроитель в истории и одна из самых лучших креативных строительно-стратегий, из таких как Анно, Цива, Тропико и другие. Для обладателей железа получше и склада с плашками ОЗУ есть еще и тысячи самых разных ассетов на любой вкус, будь то на Европейские, Американские, Латинские, СНГ, Китайские и Японские тематики. Ни в одной другой игре наверно столько нету. Игра вышла в 2015 году, но коммьюнити и ДЛС ее с легкостью продержат еще лет 5 если не больше в статусе лучшего градостроителя. А теперь напомню, что эту игру, хоть и с деньгами параходов, делали на коленках 15 финнов. Заставляет задуматься."

4427,Fun to build things in the game and menage traffic flow in your citty
4428,"Cities: Skylines is one of my favorite games ever.  Ever wanted to build a city where thousands of people live? This would be a great game for you. If you enjoy building/simulation games you will like this. Though the base game  could use some more things, mods are free! If you have some extra money, I recommend getting the DLCs. Overall, I would totally recommend it. Vanilla game: 8/10                            Game with mods/DLCs 10/10"
4429,yes.
4430,It's addicting
4431,"It's pure zen.
So satisfying and relaxing watching your city grow from tiny houses into towering skyscrapers. Once your city is big enough you can just sit back, marvel at your creation and watch the money roll on in.

There'll be that one resident who complains the taxes are too high.
Bulldoze their house so they won't bother you anymore.
You own these streets, they just live here!"

the toxic cycle of them buying out a relatively indie game and pushing them to release updates in these micro dlc's is extremely annoying and predatory, so please do yourself a favor, once you buy the game just go straight to steam workshop"

4451,yes
4452,"Definitely not at $30 for the base game alone. The engine is too old to justify that cost, not to mention most of your content (and the only reason I play) is actually user generated now, and therefore, FREE to you spare the server and lawyer fees. The only reason I'm here on Steam is because of the Humble pack deal. It made the game much more affordable for the above reasons. Otherwise, amazing game. 400% thanks to the users who put in the work for the mods and assets that make this game worth it."

4470,Best city-building/management game to date. Thriving mod community. 10/10
4471,Still one of my favorite games 7 years later.
4472,hahaha i flood building like the 1990 album flood by they might be giants
4473,"After experimenting with the Freemium mobile game [i]SimCity BuildIt[/i], I decided I wanted something more stable and unlimited. [i]SimCity[/i] itself seemed outdated and not what I was looking for at all, so I took the plunge and purchased a [i]Cities: Skylines[/i] bundle to sate my thirst for a city management game. I haven't had a single regret since and have gone on to purchase multiple expansion packs for the game.

Firstly, I adore the graphics. The weather effects are absolutely gorgeous and so are the maps, ground and water textures. The textures of the people aren't particularly detailed but I wanted a city building and traffic management game, not a population simulator. The base game itself comes with plenty to keep you occupied, along with supported mods that give you unlimited funds so you can focus on building rather than challenge. Even with the lack of financial challenge that comes with this mod, having to keep the citizens happy with the right combination of road space and green space means that you still have some obstacles to overcome.

There are certain things that didn't impact my game play too much and weren't massive turn offs, but are still enough to frustrate me from time to time. The PC I play this on is somewhat powerful and moving the map does lag, especially when placing pipes or roads. The speed tends to lag too; I've found that putting the speed on 1 or 2, the cars tend to go faster than when it's on the fastest option.

The cons I have aren't incredibly important either, but more so than what I've listed above. Some effects, particularly the rain, tend to obscure the map and make it hard to see what's going on. This can be difficult when you're trying to place things down. The same goes for the night; even with the light emitting from the cursor, you can't seen enough to place things down from a distance. I'd love an update that includes the option to lighten the map when in 'build mode' (like how the map turns white when viewing transport routes).

Overall I'd recommend this game to anyone looking for a city management simulator. Not sure if this would appeal to those who want to decorate their city and that's it, but if you're the type of person [strike](like me)[/strike] who enjoys watching your city thrive and follow bus routes as they struggle to fit all the tourists in, then this is the game for you.

As for the expansion packs, I'd recommend [i]Mass Transit[/i], [i]Industries[/i] and [i]Campus[/i] as they expand on all the features you have in the base game. For new content, I'd recommend [i]Snowfall[/i] and [i]Green Cities[/i] as they add some new features like snow and eco-friendly options. [i]Natural Disasters[/i] is a good pack [i]but[/i] I wouldn't recommend it to people who hate the thought of losing their hard work to earthquakes or tsunamis. Do get that pack if you decide on getting [i]Parklife[/i] though; as many people have mentioned in the comments to that expansion pack, you need [i]Natural Disasters[/i] in order to unlock the firefighting helicopter that's used to put out park fires.

[b]TL;DR:[/b] This game is a solid 10/10 for those who enjoy management games. The graphics are wonderful, the game play is enchanting, and the expansion packs are completely optional."
4474,very gucci of them
4475,The game is insanely fun and always provides ways to expand and grow your city
4476,yes
4477,The best game ever :)
4478,"be careful, this game is addictive"

but what do i do like? the great deals you can find on CarMax, now in the modern day buying a car can be a difficult task, but CarMax makes it as simple and simple to buy and purchase cars from all over the.
why shop with CarMax? well AutoTrader makes it simple, easy and efficient to buy cars, many, many cars, so many. by the bucketfull even!

4495,"Build awesome city for 3 hours. Make a comeback from being in debt because you don't understand the game. Lose it all because you didn't know you were supposed to empty the landfills so everyone gets sick and dies or moves because of the smell. Very good game,"
4496,"Simcity better, however I love watching youtube videos of CS, so it's ok."
4497,"Unreal game. Sim City 2000, but so much better."
4498,"Cities Skylines is a good, intuitive urban-planning sim that lacks depth. While on the surface the game is quite suitable for most kinds of players due to its user friendly design and not so serious approach to building a city. Many will find themselves disappointed once they want to do anything more complicated than putting down grids. Building a interchange is unnecessarily difficult due to space and height limitations; No way to change lane arrows nor traffic lights timer without a mod; No tram, mono rail, or even taxis in the base game... Although the game is welcoming and fairly cheap, hence my point in recommending this game, it lacks the proper content to be true city sim, but I guess the mod scene kind of makes up for that."
4499,"Great game, lots of fun."
4500,"Please help.

I cannot escape.

4547,"As someone who played sim city way back in the day (yes the original version from 1989), and loved it.  Yes, I was alive then.  I even played Sim City 2000 and Sim City 3000.  Then I lost interest in the series.  I found this game an it is awesome! It was good on the Xbox One but, on PC with mods this game is the best."
4548,"I enjoy the depth that the game brings, but also how it provides a gradual learning curve that introduces you to new concepts as you achieve certain milestones. Locking away the more advanced features until you've demonstrated mastery of the earlier features. It's a great game to tend to on a regular basis, like a digital zen garden."

4558,This game is very cool you can do a lot of stuff in it. And I really enjoy playing this game
4559,A vastly over-rated city building game that doesn't feed information back to the player enough. Everyone gets sick and the game doesn't bother telling you why so you have to use websearches.

4581,realistic traffic simulator
4582,Best city building game ever made
4583,"Compared to Sim City 4 (ancient at this point) this game is pretty good among city management games. I do notice issues with zoning demand not increasing anymore after playing large, long-game maps, but there are a ton of features here that I barely needed Workshop mods for. One thing that would be cool to have is multiplayer."
4584,This game is very fun and I would always recomend it

step two: wait for traffic to slow everything to a halt

4598,this game is very good its 7 years old but has so much replayability and very chill
4599,"No competition best city builder out there right now. Only downside is the cost of DLC that make the game worth putting long hours into, and the fact that those dlc are not transferable across consoles (I have complete edition for PC and Xbox). Great modding community adds a lot of depth to the field of play on this game and no matter what your Mayorial management style is through all the DLC and Mods you'll find something for you."
4600,Eğlenceli! Çok Eğlenceli!
4601,"Worth a look if you like city builders. Definitely recommend a few expansions to make it feel a bit less ""vanilla"""
4602,"Solid Sim City clone :) i can also recommend their first game, Cities in Motion."
4603,This is one of the best game. I love how I'm able to build my own city until I make a traffic jam and then I start over.
4604,Very innovating and educative game!
4605,good game but eats loads of ram if you use mods
4606,"Do you want to spend hours and hours making new huge cities with consistent expansion packs and content available through the workshop? If so, buy this game!"
4607,nah its not what it used to be.
4608,Amazing game with mods. Without mods I say it's a 7/10 but the mods make it so addicting. Don't download too many though cause ur game will crash.
4609,My Favorite Game!!!
4610,"Such a fun city simulation game. It does have a lot of things to take into account, such a zoning, services, policies, pollution, traffic (very important to get right), connections, etc. You can really make a city yours by customization with limitless possibilities. The DLCs are 80% great such as the University and Theme Parks ones. It does take a lot of time to understand the mechanics of making a city efficient and tourist attracting, but once a city starts expanding, it can really make for an enjoyable time making whatever you want. I highly recommend this for anyone who wants to feel like a God making a city as good, or bad, as you want to with no one telling you what to do."
4611,Fed my citizens with their own poo to save money. Would definitely recommend!
4612,"Yes.  This is the game you wish you had.  This is the one you really hope it's going to be.  

It wont let you down.

Best city building sim around, you can micromanage the heck out of literally everything, if you wanted.  Or, you can just paint a city and let it dry without touching any of the finer details, and it will thrive."
4613,just one more street... just one more street....
4614,"great game, especially if you want to recreate flint, michigan"
4615,This is what Sim City should have been and wanted to be. Even the DLC model is something that EA would kill for. This is probably the best city sim today even though it's been out for years and years.
4616,its great and gives lots of freedom while playing
4617,Such a great game!!
4618,i am engineering student. good game. so much fun.
4619,Awesome city builder. A great replacement for Sim City and the devs just keep adding new content. A must buy.
4620,"jó game, de magas kreativitási szint kell egy jó város megépítéséhez, ahol nincsenek forgalmi fennakadások (legalábbis a traffic view szerint), és szerintem elég kicsi terültetre lehet építeni még az összes rész megvásárlása után is, ami 9 négyzet"
4621,still the best citybuilder out there.
4622,.
4623,"If you grew up with Sim City, this is the game for you!
Imagine being able to do everything you could in Sim City, but more! So many fun buildings to add with Mods and Assets. During the steam summer and winter sales, this often goes on sale for very cheap, so if you're on the fence, I recommend waiting and giving it a try; you won't be disappointed!

My only gripe with the game is that it can be laggy once your city gets really big; Looking forward to a better optimized Cities Skylines 2 sometime soon!"

4645,Best money spent in a while.
4646,The game is very addictive. However I only have two complaints. The AI controlling the vehicles could stand to be reworked. Traffic jams are simply too easy to get when an entire lane has to come to a halt for one car to merge. And I would love the ability to place parks along pathways instead of them needing to be placed along side a road.

4653,"Great game... but even after all these years and dlc releases there is no option to pan the camera with the mouse. Utterly baffling. Imagine if an FPS came out in which you could only move the camera with the arrow keys. Obviously that would be unacceptable, This is no different. I have to assume the only reason people are willing to put up with this is because they've downloaded a mod to fix the issue, as I did for the 60 hours that I've played, but coming back after a few years I can't get the mod to work. I know this sounds dramatic but it really does hamper my experience enough that I don't think it's worth playing and I'm of the opinion that a game should be able to stand on it's own, without mods to make up for the features it lacks."

4657,"Cities: Skylines holds the entry to unlimited imagination. Before you create a new game, a world filled with possibilities sits right behind it. And it isn’t until you create it they are realized. Such potential they bring to our minds."
4658,"Big Thanks to Humble Bundle for their Amazing Deals!

I will be quick and short with my review:
Gameplay 10/10 - Best & most Realistic Simulator of its kind
Graphics 9/10 - Good

Problems:
The pricing for this game and its DLCs is what kept me from buying it for a very long time. It is just too expensive."
4659,while i dont like the fact that the dlc follows the sims model i think the game is fun and the fact that you can get the base game for next to nothing makes for a lot of fun for a low price
4660,"Wonderful game, I love it"
4661,"Great game, love the constructional aspects."
4662,"Recommended with hesitation.  This game does amazing things if you like building communities and seeing them work.  I watch some people build and am amazed at what they do and it is fascinating.  Building myself is another story.  You can't get into this game with a little time here and there.  The learning curve is quite steep.  The original publishers did a poor job of making the game so there are many mods needed to make it not highly frustrating.  And even with mods it can be highly frustrating.  I play with my iPhone handy so I can look up 'how to do . .  "".  How to find the mod, how to connect a path to a road, how to set up bus stops and on and on.  I happen to have some time on my hands to play something time consuming but I'm not sure when other people find the time.  It's really the community of players that make the game at all worth it because they fix the flaws and fill in the gaps."
4663,"Best city builder there is, as simple as that."
4664,"The game is very enjoyable. So much to do, and not enough downtime to do it! The workshop community is huge, opening the doors for infinitely more possibilities! The DLC is a bit pricey, but the workshop definitely makes up for it! 5 stars!"

4715,"The beauty of Cities: Skylines is there's no one way to do things. 

If you need a game where you can relax but still actively play something, this might just be for you. While the game requires your attention, it doesn't demand it like an RTS or FPS. But it requires just enough that you're engaged unlike an idle game. 

Get your gamer juice, put on your comfy clothes and relax."

[Extra comments]
This game wouldeve been more fun if you could control more factors while making your city for example what shops you build or disasters like heatwaves.But even if these were added I wouldent want to pay a dlc because it would probs cost like 20 euro at most and itd get repatative and boring.The good things are that this game is great if you wanna play it once in every month or so and its like any other city building game not worse, not better but in the middle."
4724,"If you've got more than $300 to spend on a poorly optimized and dated game which still needs mods to function somewhat desirable, then go ahead. -- It is after 7 years still the best game in the city builder genre. But is it worth it for a price which would allow you to buy EVERY single serious competitor to this game and more? I'd say no."
4725,.
4726,"build city, make money"
4727,"For the most part, it is a great game.  I have really enjoyed it immensely  until a little over a week ago when I could no longer play the game because of an ""App running' error.  I have been asking for assistance for over a week and nothing but run-a-rounds.   It shows that I have played the game for 1,099 hours but in truth, I have only played for 800 hours - the other 300 hours is the game playing by itself on Steam). If Paradox (as well as Steam) are unwilling to correct the error - why subject yourself to stress and frustration?"
4728,put on a podcast and lose track of time
4729,"I would recommend to others, but be aware this game does takes a lot of patience and time to build and play."
4730,I like this game a lot

I'm convinced this game invented time travel.
Great game though"

4744,"I give it a try, n now im in love with the game"
4745,frod
4746,Great game. Good way to learn city planning
4747,I love it as a sandbox type game for designing a city but the core mechanic of traffic and city management just isn't that satisfying of an experience. With mods you can add some fun features but I wish much more customization and unique cities were allowed. I got bored pretty quickly after my first few cities.
4748,My favorite game of all time the only bad thing is about the building designs sometimes I dont like when the design is repeating all the time but overall 9/10
4749, fun
4750,"This game is everything SimCity has wanted to be for the last 20 years.

Fuck SimCity."
4751,"Really scratches that Civilization 'one more turn' itch, though there aren't any turns, so I may just never stop playing."
4752,It is just simply the best and more detailed city builder out there. I am not even starting to talk about modding ability and the quantity of the content.
4753,"i love this game and if I had real life friends, I'd recommend it wholeheartedly :)"
4754,fun
4755,Great Steam Workshop community!
4756,"Best city builder by an astronomical margin. The modding community is amazing and the extra content is great. 
The ONLY thing I would like in Cities Skylines 2 would be to zone and build along walk/bike-paths to design low/no car cities."

4766,its a good game idk i want to rate it but not write a description but whatever
4767,Very addictive. 8/10.
4768,"Crash and Burn. Crash and Burn. Love it when it's working, hating it when it crashes all the time and there is no support from Steam or Paradox or anyone. Support is non-existent."
4769,"The Best City Building Game, By Far!!!"
4770,Great city builder taking many of the best components of the classic Sim city series and putting them together really nicely. Its not perfect some of the Stats and graphs don't match up to whats going on. Overall however its a fine city builder as a whole. DLC adds to the game as well.
4771,Good City Builder
4772,"If you want to feel what it's like to be civil engineer after  you messed up traffic flow creating massive amounts of gridlock, this is the game for you. 
Game is genuinely educational on why modern cities are created the way they are along with being quite fun, just don't buy it at full price as DLC's are soft required for the more interesting stuff."
4773,good
4774,Good game just don't let the poopy water mix with the drinking water or everyone passes away.

4779,"This is the wonderful game.
This game is addictive :D"
4780,"Great game, sunk wayyy too many hours into designing the perfect looking intersections. Defs need to get a bunch of mods to make the game even better"
4781,I fell in love with this game even before I purchased it. I got it initially from Epic Games for free but wanted to have a better way to add mods and assets to the game so ended up purchasing it here. A decision I am totally happy with. I recommend this game to anyone who likes to create something in a leisurely manner.
4782,"I have played over 1200 hours in this game on another account. But I'll say that this game is a lot of fun if you have the extra money to spare, otherwise the predatory DLC make me sadly give this game a Do Not Recommend. This game is a very par game on its own, and I think what made it stand out so much is because it is the successor to the disastrous Simcity 5. If you're looking for the best city simulator on its OWN look at the SimCitys from the 2000s. C:S uses the standard Paradox DLC model: make the base game just playable enough to the point the player seeks things that really should have been in base game. Parklife, After Dark, Industries, Mass Transit, maybe Natural Disasters are probably the only DLC that were worthy in my mind. All the others are overpriced and don't add much to the game. 

And then there's mods. The saving grace of this game. Mods fix almost everything. Low FPS? Fixed. Fix traffic? Done (well, make it work better). Better assets than vanilla C:S? Yes. The Workshop is seriously the only thing that allowed me to make a city I actually liked looking at and felt realistic. But the Workshop also showed how thin C:S really is. Same buildings over and over again, almost all looking weird and out of place. Traffic takes the quickest route possible, cuts off each other constantly, police and ambulance travel ACROSS the city to reach a destination that has an emergency building right beside it. Huge performance issues after around 50k people. A lot of these issues can be fixed with mods, however C:S on its own is rather disappointing. Personally I'd wait to see what C:S2 has to bring, or get this game on a big sale.  

Do I have fun with this game, yes, with mods (especially fun with the multiplayer mod).  I'm gonna give the game a 6.5/10 on its own, and a 8/10 with the right mods. Like I said before, buy this game on sale if you want it."
4783,The game crashes on launch despite me having a top of the line PC to run it.
4784,"Went on a Workshop download spree, crashed my game, ordered two more sticks of RAM for my computer, got overconfident and went on another Workshop spree, now my game takes approximately 7.5 million years to load and stutters like mad.

10/10, will happily continue to suffer for my beautifully landscaped parks.

(Side note: I would have stopped playing at like 15 hours if it weren't for the community mods. This game's modders and asset creators are a fabulous bunch and I am forever grateful for their continued efforts to make this game everything it had the potential to be.)"

4805,More addictive than heroin... with some of the same side effects ;)
4806,"I love this game, in part due to City Planner Plays demonstrating just how much you can do with it in vanilla. Of course, several Workshop subscriptions do help if you want things to be absolutely perfect. Just don't let perfect be the enemy of good, and have fun while playing. I enjoy creating Green Cities and Towns with plenty of public transport the most. This game really gives you the freedom to create any kind of city, town, or village you desire, and I love it so much."
4807,"Best city builder I've ever played, and I've played a lot of them. It's relaxing, addicting, and fun. You can play it as casually or intensely as you like. It's not perfect, and I'm eagerly waiting for CS2 to improve on the formula. But it's as close to a perfect city builder as there is right now, especially with mods.

10/10 would bring my computer to its knees trying to start it after subscribing to 10,000 mods again"
4808,"This is might is very enjoyable to building your lands to controls your own lands, to making your residents to paying the rents but one things is a problem is when you paying a insurance for waters, eletric and stuff."

This is hands donw the best modern era city builder or even the best city builder in general (maybe)."

4813,I like this game! I like building city and making buildings! because it is fun!
4814,good game
4815,YEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
4816,Excellent City building simulator
4817,"Before playing this game, I've already watched some friends playing this game and lots of youtube content creators. Just by watching it already made me interested to the game until I finally purchased it on sale.

I already have 25 hrs of playing just in 3-4 days having this game, playing uncontrollably until 3-4 AM and I like it that much. However I would it's not the easiest game in the world. I had to do much trial and error before finally settle my small cities, which I personally think it's fine and quite rewarding when you are finally able to make something work AND aesthetically pleasing.

Whenever I feel like I already make something great, the game tells me that there is still so much to learn and deal in the game as the game progresses. I think the gradual increase of complexity this game offers is fairly acceptable, that gives a bit of challenge but at the same time doesn't stop you from being creative. Also, I purchased some recommended DLCs and I think mostly are worth the price since, again, it gives the complexity you need.

Conclusion: buy this game if you like building city to feed your creativity, but at the same time solving real worlds issue like traffic, garbage, pollution, electricity efficiency, determining which place would be great for residential. commercial, or industries. Additionally, please search on youtube something like: ""getting started on Cities Skyline"" and decide from there whether you wanna play it or not."
4818,"Its great as a city builder.  Very happy with it as a step along from good old SimCity series.
However I did lose interest after a couple dozen hours.  Probably something I will come back to from time to time.
Not so much a fan of the abilities unlocking over time/growth, but I see how it works.
Also having to get so many DLC to get a full experience I am not keen on, would rather basic things like mass transit was included.

Overall happy with my initial purchase."
4819,gud
4820,perfect game
4821,great city builder
4822,"It's a more complicated SimCity, I enjoy it, just wish I had the mental effort to play it some more :P"
4823,pre good ngl
4824,I love how you can realisticly build your own city :)
4825,100% the best city sim!
4826,its fun you get to play as mayor and builder and so much things are awsome btw TIP if you download a infinite money mod you will  have fun alot of fun!
4827,10/10 they predicted elon musk buying twitter
4828,"ability to create my own tiny world
"
4829,"Cities: Skylines takes me back to the days of Sim City and Sim City 2000/3000 where there was a ton of freedom as to how you build your city and how you solved all of the problems that come along with that. I've created a couple of dozen different cities and each one has been fun to build starting from a simple hamlet all the way up to a sprawling metropolis. Over time I've learned to incorporate better transit options into my builds and I've taken advantage of the various DLCs to extend the experience.

Cities: Skylines is a very calm kind of game where your city (mostly) hums with life. Terrific fun. Highly recommend!"
4830,"This is the fun of the old Sim City games, but better in almost every way."
4831,its so good you can get good mods
4832,This game has held up well especially in the modding community. Tons of fun for all ages with a creative itch. Hope to see a second installment some day.
4833,big city go brrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr
4834,Relaxing!
4835,"Love this game. Not sure its right to call it a game, its more of a simulation. But I dont mean that in a bad way. I like how you can be really creative."
4836,very good i like
4837,very good stratedgy
4838,its a good game but the moment you get a mod or dlc it is very unstable and can work for hours one day but not start the next
4839,"Its fun and amazing long update's tho, I reccomend it :D
"
4840,tis gud
4841,todo se recomienda a trafico
4842,house
4843,"The wonderful successor to Simcity after EA took a dookie in the bed. This game is solid through and through, my only complaint is the Dynamic Weather usually involves fog and makes it hard to view your city at night. I recommend disabling Dynamic Weather in the gameplay settings.

Enjoy!"
4844,this game really grabs you're attention. Very interesting and they keep you challenged. With mods of other players you can expand the game as much as you want! Awesome game!
4845,"lots of dimensions to this city builder. Base game is a little lacking, but the modding community make up the difference. A little buggy in places, so debugging does detract from the gameplay"
4846,-
4847,"Not enough cows, but still fun"
4848,"You build cites and maybe (OK definitely  blow them up) tis fun.

4859,"This is what SimCity could've been, should've been!"
4860,recomended
4861,Do you have way too much free time? Would you like to use that free time to learn how to become a city planner? no? You should get this game anyway it's great.
4862,Nice game
4863,"This game is addicting. Every time I create a city, I find tricks that I acquire and use them in my next city. Been playing this game for years now and it never gets old."
4864,good game but lacks assets and lots of content to get that you either have to pay  a lot for dlcs with minimal content or use mods and assets to get compatibility issues
4865,An amazing game that fully able to experience how persistently it is to becoming the mayor of the city in the real world. Very recommended!
4866,city builder very nice use mod for very nicer
4867,It is not japanese so we should put in mod.This game is helpful for studying english.I gained experience practical english for this game
4868,Best game I ever played to build cities. I highly recommend you play it.
4869,"Astonishing graphics, not that resource-heavy (though it's not precisely light), interesting simulation engine. I fully recommend it."
4870,very cool yes
4871,provides joy
4872,"wow cool game
"
4873,"One of the best City building games, and supports a good modding community"
4874,"i like to play this heavily modded, very fun very relaxing"
4875,very addictive. stay away. 10/10
4876,One of the best city building sims available
4877,갓겜...
4878,Will buy all the dlc if multiplayer added
4879,WTF
4880,it's okay
4881,This is a game.
4882,FUN!
4883,"I like the fact that it always keeps me interested and I don't have to kill people.  I dislike the fact that even though I have an I7, 32 gig of ram over 400 gig of free HD space it still freezes frequently."
4884,Such an addicting game. I love it.
4885,yes
4886,sick
4887,asome WITH MODS
4888,"Absolutely love this game, have several more hours in it on Playstation and Switch. One of the reasons I have decided to pursue civil engineering with a focus on transportation in college."
4889,"very good
"
4890, this game is harder than Cinema 4D
4891,Great game for city building.
4892,"What I like:
It's a fun simulation for a few runs. Watching the city grow and develop is cool, and it's fun to manage all the upgrades and requirements and stuff. Planning out the city and making everything flow is a fun challenge too. Bonus, if you enjoy building little dioramas of cities, this is the game for you. The steam workshop has models for loads and loads of city related items.

What I don't like:
You can start to see the cracks in the game engine once your city hits higher population levels. The behavior of cars isn't quite like it is in real life, and so on. Mods can help with this, but it's more a matter of personal choice and interest.

Verdict:
Buy it. It's fun, especially if you like the idea of city planning."
4893,dgdvdzg
4894,pretty sex ngl.
4895,"I mean, it's a city-sim game. If you enjoy those, you'll like this."
4896,i enjoy building big city then hitting with a meteor :)
4897,"Insane game that I loved so
Much"
4898,"It's a good game, and worth it, but the dlcs are a bit over. Expensive, and doesn't do much. But you know what? If Paradox adds a multiplayer feature in one of their dlcs, i'm buying it. (Really would make the game better for people like me)"
4899,very addictive
4900,"✔difficulty in building a road with a slant
✔Transport fever 2 is better
✔buy it with pocket money, use it because i want it🗿
✔Many lighting accessories but not yet available"
4901,"Good game, can be confusing when trying to figure out how to solve issues like educated workers and access to certain amenities, but overall lots of fun. Very easy to sink tons of hours into, usually before you even realize it lmao"
4902,The last city builder you will ever need.  (And probably the last we will get thanks to Paradox and their love of DLC)
4903,"its nice
"
4904,Fun game!
4905,jag går till och med minus med fusk
4906,game simulator best!
4907,epic city building game even without dlcs and trash pc like i have its tons of fun
4908,خداس ولی پدرسگ وقت زیاد میبره
4909,Sangat bagus grafiknya walaupun PC saya kentang
4910,Its complex but worth learning.
4911,"Closest thing you'll get to a successor to Sim City that's mechanically and functionally competent, even if it doesn't have the charm and wit that Maxis had with Sim City 1-4."
4912,its fun
4913,simulator de 3e lien no cap
4914,"This game is a lot of fun once you get used to it. That being said it does take a while to get the hang of, and in my case I started independently studying city planning so that I can play the game better. I highly recommend others to play this game!! (I out two exclamation marks after it so you know I mean it :))"
4915,The best Sim city since Sim City. Like better then every attempt EA made after their latest fiasco.
4916,Cities are cool I guess?
4917,its just good
4918,"Even with my lower end laptop, it runs smoothly on medium-ish graphics- keep in mind i have 1 gb of ram and i dont even know for video processing, this game is awesome."
4919,definitely amazing
4920,"Great City builder game, a shame that a lot of content is kinda locked behind DLC but its still really good vanilla."
4921,such a detailed game its addicting!
4922,coolboyfortnite
4923,Good game
4924,hard game always into the minus dont buy it if you just wanna chill :/
4925,meh
4926,fun
4927,You can create any city you want. but it can lag a lot
4928,Not intuitive. Toggling was bad. Disappointed.
4929,"i like the Cities: Skylines , This game is no different from simcity"
4930,good
4931,balls balls balls!
4932,Great game!
4933,"It's very relaxing, even on scenarios. There are so many things to do, especially with the info panel and with traffic management. It's very relaxing to just watch the traffic and occasionally add or remove a traffic light."
4934,Very detailed
4935,Amazing Fun Extordinary
4936,poggers Xd
4937,This game is really incredible especially for just the base game this game offers so much gameplay! This game could take real time years to complete and that is the best part. I have only played it for 2 days and I already love it so much! Best city building game I have ever played since Sim City! 10/10
4938,cool game but wanted a multiplayer
4939,"Great city builder, still wish there was another B&W though :["

4941,Good Game definitely would recommend
4942,good game
4943,Buy it.
4944,Sadly it is unplayable on a M1 Mac Mini
4945,compared to other builder games i have played this on is very good. graphics are good and the game is so in depth.
4946,You can be very detailed especially with mods on the pc. Managing a city can be a very good challenge.
4947,Best PC game
4948,"Always a fun time to build and fix your own mistakes, this game is super realistic and I've only had it purchased for a few days but I've spent the last few days solely playing cities skylines and it's great"
4949,really enjoyable but hard to get used to but once you have it gets easy
4950,"Very chill game. It's pretty hard once you start, but once you learn how to play it's really good."
4951,This is a wonderful game . It is always different each time you play. I LOVE IT
4952,this game is addictive ngl
4953,"its a fun game, lots to do."
4954,"Surprisingly realistic city builder. For how complex it is, it eases you into is very slowly. Great game."
4955,Absolute fun!

4959,"great game

4960,"Yes, good"
4961,It doesn't suck.
4962,It's good.
4963,Game is challenging but fun and interesting!
4964,Fun and relaxing
4965,.
4966,"Played it for a little bit. The graphics aren't the best but it seemed fun. The next day I wanted to play it again - impossible though. It keeps saying that it's running but it doesn't, and when I try to stop it it doesn't do that either. I uninstalled, reinstalled it, restarted my laptop three times now, nothing.
Pretty disappointing..."
4967,"I love Cities: Skylines because of the meditative experience while building your town. The game's progression remains entertaining even when you are about to be done with your city. When you think you got a proper town running, there's always 'traffic' to take care of. Which is not a bad thing, since most large cities remain having this problem. 

Overall, the game is moderately challenging and has a definite formula that you can use in order to get it running properly. 

It would be nice to have some more multiplayer, but that's my own preference."
4968,good graphics and the game allows a diverse amount of things to play on building the city
4969,"A really great captivating game, a worthy successor of Sim City 4.

Although not part of the Sim City franchise, Cities: Skylines captures the same spirit that the original Sim City and Sim City 2000 had, with added cherries on top, which other remakes and city sim's failed to do.

If you're a Sim City fan or just curious about city simulators I highly recommend giving this a go."
4970,best city builder ever
4971,Love getting immersed
4972,good
4973,i have a tendency to illegally dump my city's waste back into the water system without filtration with every city i make

just missing some politics and economy like inflation,law, job value adjustment"

4979,"can get extremely boring
not for everyone"
4980,Coo coo
4981,"Looking for a city builder with tons of content? Want to feel like you are playing a Sim City game but with more content? This is the game. 
Cities: Skyline is a great sandbox game made by Paradox Interactive. You can be sure to get your money's worth when it's made by them.
Sure there are DLC's but they are entirely optional. Most of them focus and expand on a specific thing that is either already in the game, like more airports or a new industry.
If you have an itch to manage your own little town and gradually expand into a large city, what are you waiting for?"
4982,I like the game and I should play it more often. Very relaxing to chill with a movie on and vibe.
4983,"I enjoy it, It's hard at first but once you get the hang of it it's relaxing building something. I have added a few DLC's which add something to the game, but if you rally want to add a  new dimension add some of the mods from the workshop. The moders are brilliant and the mods add  either more  complexity or assets for your city, cars lorries, buildings and many more."
4984,good game
4985,Love it!
4986,"hjkllnvbvvmnvm,"
4987,"playing cities skylines isn’t just a hobby, it’s a lifestyle, a reason to breathe, an escape from this cruel world filled with thieves. it’s art, the first gift you open on christmas, a hug from loved one, it’s everything you ever wanted, it’s everything you need.

4989,its a fun game
4990,Addicting
4991,"TLDR: I really don't know what to say about this game. I love the game, absolutely hate the developers.

Graphics:
Beautiful from a distance, ugly up close.

Storyline:
None

Price:
I'd say the game is priced perfectly, you'll get at least 60 hours out of it.

Difficulty:
Relatively easy to make a city with a population of 100k, exponentially harder past that.

AI:
The AI are random number generators which do nothing but make traffic annoying.

Cutscenes:
None

Fun:
I have had an absolute blast with this game... whenever it doesn't crash.

Sounds/Music:
Tbh I don't think I've ever noticed if the sounds are good or bad? They aren't memorable at all.

Replayability:
Infinitely replayable.

Controls:
For the most part they make sense, but unfortunately some things (like train track or road building) is extremely limited for no reason). It may be daunting to learn at first, but it's worth it.

Performance:
Terrible performance! Uses 12GB of ram idle, seems to increase by 1GB for every 150k population. CPU performance is also extremely high, sometimes leading the game to crashing.

Modding:
Mods are honestly the saving grace of the game. You can find a mod for absolutely everything, including performance mods! Please, please, please install performance mods because you will crash often otherwise.

Selling Out:
Colossal/Paradox have sold out to a new extreme. Over $250 with of DLC with ads being present in game, constantly trying to tell you to buy DLC when you launch the game.

Similar Games:
- Sim City (Sim City is much more limited)
- Software Inc (Economy Management)

Bugs:
- Tons of crashes
- Saves have been wiped if the game crashes when loading a save

NOTE: This game also requires the Paradox Launcher, an external launcher (which you likely will not need for any other game, as Paradox has no other interesting games)."

4993,The most amazing city builder ever. What makes this even better though is the brilliant community of workshop builders here on steam!
4994, I simply like creation games. if you are like minded then you will enjoy it.
4995,It's good
4996,Love this game its super easy to get and only wish i was playing on a better setup. my macbook tends to overheat playing this id recommend desktop

I now understand why the town I live in is complete S**t.

4999,"Cities skylines is the ultimate sandbox city building experience you can find. With a passionate community that produces new assets and excellent mods every day, the game essentially has endless contents. It satisfy your engineering drive and artistic aspiration more than anything else when you have finally created your own functional and beautiful city. Happy building, New mayors!"

5001,endless playing time!
5002,like it

5004,Terrible DLC monetization policy; it shouldn't cost over $250 for the full game.
5005,godamnit im in debt again
5006,good city builder highly recommend watching Biffa Plays Indie Games channel on youtube to get his traffic mod list on the steam workshop will help out greatly
5007,"I always loved Cities Skylines. I watched Biffa play it on YT and one day, I decided to get it on the Playstation 4. From there, I was hooked. A few months ago, I built my First Computer and decided to get the game just recently. I always love how Paradox gives deals regularly; it really makes the community side of the game really fun. We can't always pay full price for DLC's or the actual game, so having stuff on sale can make the difference knowing I can truly play the game how I want."

5021,play this game its gaming!
5022,I liked it because it's pretty fun to make your own city.
5023,"I am not a gamer, so at first learning the rules of this game and how everything pieced together was a struggle. I watched numerous tutorials to get a general idea as to how to create a successfully functioning city. It's taken me about 20 hours of playing time to actually feel like I know what I'm doing and now I'm HOOKED. Such a fun game with so many aspects to it. Highly recommend this game, especially if you enjoy playing something that always has you thinking and planning ahead!"

5030,"Wonderful game, great graphics, fills the modern day yearning when Simcity to Simcity Societies isn't cutting it for me at the moment. Great and challenging management sim with lots of customization. Only complaint I have is that sometimes the physics of the game with water and land can get kinda wonky and occasionally releasing the kraken, but not a deal breaker and sometimes a hoot to goof with. Can't wait to share this game with my daughter when she has better motor skills with a mouse and keyboard."
5031,Best simulator ever!
5032,Good city building game you will spend hours of hours playing.
5033,yes
5034,"WTF is that, an a** full of dlc just pumping a game to 280€?
unless it can cure cancer, this is a joke"
5035,good
5036,10/10 soviet microdistrict immersion at last
5037,amazing
5038,I have played a ton of city simulator games and have to say that Cities: Skylines really packs in a fantastic experience and SO....MUCH.....LAND!!!! I only have the After Dark DLC I think and honestly it is still a ton of fun. The Industry specialization part is a bit wonky for me other than that is a great time-passer game!
5039,Love this game.  I used to play simcity in my young adult life but like this so much better with all the additional assets and mods you can use makes your creativity for your city pretty endless.
5040,Good fucking game. 10/10
5041,i love the game very much thank you game creator of cities skylines
5042,Excellent game.

5046,"Really fun city building game. I recommend it to people that enjoy simulations, building, and chill gameplay."
5047,I'm addicted and it makes me unproductive in every other aspect of my life!
5048,"Enjoyable and Stimulating
I have been a fan of the Sims about ten years love simulation games. I greatly enjoy myself every time and highly recommend."

5053,"With 3 days played on game pass and 2 hours on steam, i can say this game can be a real challenge with plenty of problem solving involved. Best thing to do is starve your population from their money so you get rich. RAISE TAXES ALWAYS. Best and only solution."
5054,"This game is good, the only major issue is that the game does not provide a detailed explanation for many things. So youtube is your best friend if you want a true guide. Also, mixed used development is awesome, and also screw huge parking lots. Happy Mike Wazowski."
5055,pp
5056,best game ever
5057,imagine buying a game for AAA price and finding out the dozens of dlc packs will cost you over $250.

5060,its relaxing game
5061,
5062,"Where are the policies to do with keeping ""them"" out. If you get my drift"
5063,i killed all the people
5064,Just not fun. It feels like you're constantly fighting with the UI to find what you want and then again to execute things the way you want them.
5065,"I wouldn't recommend Cities: Skylines unless you also want to shell out $100+ for the dlc. Without the numerous dlc packs, the game feels quite empty, and it lacks a lot of features you would expect in a game about city building."
5066,"If you just want to turn mods on and build to make  a cool looking city then its fine but if you want to go from a small town to a big city forget it, traffic is awful, you  can design roads with wide lanes, one ways, etc and watch cars take the most idiotic route ever as every thing falls apart because no one can get anywhere, great if you want a traffic management sim, bad for city sim, play sim city 4"
5067,10/10 if you enjoy running into paywalls while trying to explore the base mechanics of the game.
5068,"Best City Builder. It allows a natural progression of your skills, providing an easy entry for beginners while offering depth for experienced players. The mod support is also the one with the best community I have ever experienced."
5069,"Dope game, do NOT get if you have bad PC but if you want to play it badly and have bad PC, search up on YT for a tutorial, boom you can play"

DLC too expensive."

5077,$145.00 worth of DLC. Im good.
5078,Stop selling game features as dlc.
5079,"I have over 1000 hours in this game. It is a challenging, fun, and satisfying game.

If you liked the old sim city or tycoon games, you will enjoy it."
5080,Great game! :)
5081,Remove your stupid launcher and then I'll change this review and play your games again
5082,Best game ever produced!!
5083,"Sim City, as it should have been,"
5084,thumb up although i got it for 50 percent off for winning the drink your on pee challange on my discord group but would recomend
5085,"If you enjoy city builders this is pretty much the de-facto standard for today.

It's major draw back is that at a certain point the game becomes a complicated traffic sim, and not so much a city builder.

Still I have sunk a lot of time into this - fun to play while stoned."
5086,"At first gloss this game is fun. But two serious issues plague it:
1) 90% of the game is in paid DLC, think ""The Sims"". I detest companies that do this. This model of game development needs to die in lava.
2) After about 6 hours, you've done everything there is to do in this game. There are no more challenges or complex planning to be done. 

It's not worth the base game money, and it's definitely not worth the money for all the DLC they try squeeze out of you."
5087,Stuck in traffic ⛔
5088,Lots of Lag
5089,"I play many types of games (shooter, Flight simulators, GTA and more) but I've never found a game that is this good, fun, addictive and enjoyable! 

I whole heartedly recommend this game!"
5090,"Can spend hours just delving into the minute controls, micro and macro management. Sim City on steroids"
5091,good game
5092,"Had this game for a few years and never really got into it, until recently, but enjoying it now. Decent amount of fun, very nice city sim graphics. Continued development and DLC make for an ever-expanding set of experiences and fabulous replayability. I really like the fact that one can expand the city limits. The main gripe is less than smooth ability to undo when placing something by mistake, and building railroads after dark is impossible, but does creates another element that can be fun."
5093,"Awsome, I would like an DLC like war... but it's ok :)"
5094,One of my favourite games. I can spend hours building my city
5095,Fun game

5100,"It would've been a fun game if didn't have to cough up hundreds of bucks to keep up with """"""updates"""""", which add a couple of new buttons to the UI and one or two game mechanics."
5101,I think this game is an amazing little game and although I don’t have much time in it on pc yet I have countless hours in it on ps4 and I adore it. It’s fun and it really does get you to think of how to properly run a city without burning the place to the ground. I only have one issue with the game. It’s performance is really weird. I have a decent mid range pc core i7 8700 rtx30508gb  (twin edge  oc)  and 16gb of ddr4 2666 ram. But I don’t know if it’s just the engine being old or what but my cpu and gpu utilization are low which doesn’t happen in other games and the fps when zoomed in is usually in the mid 40s it’s not a huge deal I figure it’s the game being old and maybe a bit unoptimized. Other than that it’s a really enjoyable game I really like playing it when I have spare time to kill. You should definitely make a mobile phone version :)
5102,very good if modded
5103,"If you're looking for a worthy successor to Sim City 4 look elsewhere. Skylines is not a city sim and your cities will never reach the size and complexity of those in Sim City.

Its more of a traffic manager sim with city building, there are no real challenges apart from dealing with retarded traffic behaviour. That said its not a bad game, just not what I was expecting."
5104,YES
5105,good game car go brrr
5106,"As someone with a Bachelors degree in city planning, I wholeheartedly endorse this game. I grew up playing SimCity 4 and this blows it out of the water. 10/10"
5107,city
5108,yes
5109,"hello i have a problem when playing cities skyline,when i want to play its not working.(first installation its work) but when i quit the game and want to play its again,games is not working (game is running but not appear) then i going to uninstall paradox launcher and install paradox launcher again its working,but then when i stop playing and want to play game again its not working again..i only can play this game when uninstall and install paradox launcher,how can i fix this problem???do anyone have same problem with me??"
5110,Good game
5111,every city planner should know how to play this.
5112,nice
5113,fun game. kinda pissed cuz i bought it and then 10 hours later it goes on sale
5114,Love this game. It is an escape!
5115,GOOD GAME GO BRRRRRRRRRRRR
5116,"I refused to let the people leave the city, then I didn't give them basic needs."
5117,dlc to have fun
5118,"This game is awesome! The vanilla game can get a bit boring, but if you install mods you have endless fun! It's a hard game that requires a lot of skill. Traffic is basically impossible to fix without mods and it can be a bit overwhelming. Since it's a great game, it's incredibly heavy. You need a super good PC to play this comfortably. Overall, great game."
5119,"Installed 100+ mods - Makes cities my PC can not run = Best City Builder on the Platform.
"
5120,Very confusing for beginners
5121,DLC Pricing Strats :(
5122,Shits addicting be careful
5123,great
5124,predatory DLC hell. DLCs cost more than 5 times worth of base game.
5125,Just a fun game to unwind and get lost in. Love all the detailing you can do to really create special spaces within a city.
5126,T H E   C I T Y   M U S T   G R O W   B I G G E R   A N D   S T R O N G E R
5127,cool city
5128,This is the best fun I've had with a game for long time. I just wish there was a clearer way to tell why people suddenly move out but other than that love it.
5129,"In my opinion, this is undisputedly the most in depth and detailed city building game. Between the incredible care and detail the developers put into this game, and the support they have for mods, you can truly make whatever kind of city you want. This game deserves all the praise in the world."
5130,fun game but would definitly recommend to use mods
5131,Still the best City Builder so far. It takes over where Sim City 4 left and putting in so much more stuff to do. With DLC:s you have City Skylines 1.5. Still waiting for other companies to catch up.
5132,Is a wonderful game. It learn you to think the hole time and that is what I like about this game. Have play many years ago Sim City but this is a million times better.
5133,good and fun game
5134,"Oh the road you're trying to attach to is 4 inches too far to the right? Sorry, ""space already occupied"". Go ahead and tear down half of your city trying to place this single road, it still wont work."
5135,"Ruined by Paradox, years after they bought it.

You can piss right off with the DLC-scams - they are by and far NOT worth the asking price. Get your game copy by other means if possible - preferably an older version of the game."
5136,Fun waste of time
5137,My comfort food
5138,Paradox's DLC policy is an absolute scam. Don't let them get away with this.
5139,much city
5140,I like
5141,.
5142,"Fantastic city builder. I love the amount of detail. You can go from an overview of your entire city to watching the daily activities of individual cims. You get a lot of tools to be either creative or realistic with your designs. Then you get to sit back and see whether it works or not. The DLCs make it even more enjoyable.

Pro tips for living in my cities:
-Always leave an hour early to account for traffic.
-The garbage truck will come eventually. Stop complaining.
-NEVER criticize my decisions or I will bulldoze your fucking house."
5143,"Amazing game, wish the road rules were less strict but that can easily be fixed with mods"
5144,"The new Paradox Launcher bricks itself, and you cannot open it nor the game. GG f**kers"
5145,very fun
5146,"if you have interest with building a city, this game is really recommended."
5147,This game is very addictive which is a good thing its very fun and I love seeing your city come to life.(only problem is that I think the dlc content should be in the base game)
5148,this is good as eating chicken
5149,good
5150,qwqwq
5151,very fun building big cities
5152,ok
5153,"I live city Tashkent
I love this game
I love my mom
I love Steam
I love money 
& im hate dictator"
5154,If you like city building programs.... and don't mind shopping for some damn fine DLC then this is the game for you. I have burned hours with this.
5155,Everything I ever wished SimCity would be.
5156,good game
5157,IT'S TOO FUN.
5158,This game is super awesome! Lots of great mods and DLC to make every play session interesting!
5159,I like it when botat
5160,Great addition to the genre of city simulators. The few weaknesses in the game are easily supplemented with mods. Would definitely recommend to a friend.
5161,Once I was able to make a profit and keep a town going without debt is was amazing lmfao
5162,"Honestly, a little better and more detailed than Simcity. but i wish they could add some more disasters like maybe a nuclear fallout or warheads hitting the city or something dramatic lol. Great game though"
5163,"good
"
5164,"a good game to relive stress
"
5165,"it is spore fun
"
5166,"I have played every version of Sim City and Civilizations. This is by far the best simulator I have ever come across. The amount of specialization done by players across the world pretty much makes this a new game every time you go to the workshop.
"
5167,"Improved my city building skills, that I never knew I needed."
5168,"the best city builder game ever
"
5169,"I really enjoy Cities: Skylines because it allows you to be creative, you are not waiting for something to happen. There is enough variety in topography to allow you to develop alternate building themes or use the same map and come up with a different result."
5170,its ok
5171,gg
5172,The best traffic managing simulator on the market.
5173,"lot of fun, great modding community"
5174,"Cities: Skylines is a great game! I play with user generated content (UGC) and it really enhances an already great game! My only issue with the game is that it takes a long time to load and sometimes crashes. Other than that, Cities: Skylines is an awesome city building experience!"
5175,Great for little nerds that wanna be city planners
5176,good game
5177,Absolutely Amazing !
5178,"excellent game, it improves planning and creative skills"
5179,"100+ mods and you are set to go, 10/10"
5180,deeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeez
5181,"""shut up Obama, go blow up another hospital""
- schlatt's twitch chat"
5182,"it is a game. You can build cities. You can do a lot in your city. You need to keep your people happy. If the base game is too boring you can download enough assets via the steam workshop to crash your PC. Is it good? Good is subjective. I like city builders and I like this game. If you like city builders and don't like this game, we do not have the same taste. If you don't like city builders, I probably do not understand you. 8/10 game with 12/10 mod support and -1,46/10 in monitazation."
5183,"[h1] Gettin tired of Real World City Life? this game here is the perfect alternative! Relaxing experience for hours and hours and hours, That is until you realize that Cities:Skylines traffic is as horrifying as the real world [/h1]"

"
5185,ok
5186,.
5187,"Beautiful game loaded with detail and intriguing gameplay. If you love creating and planning, whether in a perfect grid design or a more organic style, Cities is for you. There's already a ton of content to create dynamic, interesting and aesthetically pleasing cities, but add in the workshop and there's no limit to the possibilities of what you can create.

If you want to sit back for a minute or wait for money to accumulate, you can zoom in and watch your citizens run errands, go to work, drive or ride one of the plethora of public transit options and engage in activities like walking through parks, fishing, dining, etc. It's pretty mesmerizing...

Just be sure to pause the game and go get some sleep/sunlight/food IRL every now and then.

Also be aware of music packs. they don't add anything but radio stations to listen to. Unless you have money to blow on that sorta thing, I just listen to 3P apps while playing."
5188,great game amazing graphics
5189,good
5190,"Great game, I wish they had a better system for dlc tho"
5191,"This is the best City Builder ever created.  It is pricey to get all DLCs at one go, but when you can find it on sale, you can get them all fairly inexpensively.

The mod community is great, probably the best of any game on Steam.  I have over 1900 hours in the game at the time of this review.  If I could only have one game, it may well be this one."
5192,"It is a very good game and probably worth buying.  It is the monetization of the game I have a problem with.  The game has 10 small DLC packs that all cost at least 13 USD, some more.  Small as in they add little and with a limited focus.  This probably wouldn't be a problem but becomes a problem with Cities Skylines without DLC and even with mods is rather poorly featured.  Nearly every aspect of the game feels underdeveloped and plain.  As if the game was created only to be the skeleton of platform to sell DLC rather than a great game with DLC adding on to it.  It feels very much like an ice cream cone, with no ice cream.  Paradox will spoon feed you ice cream one small flavor at a time but expects you to pay a premium for that ice cream.  The entire collection of DLC often goes on sale but even at 50% off it is tough to recommend and it is only going to get more expensive.

It is a great game but has no peers in terms of price.  Other studios now deliever the quantity and quality of content comparable to these DLC packs for free.  Which adds value to the purchase.  Cities Skylines does not add value but adds cost to aquire more than the bare minimum.  Paradox is not obligated to give anything for free but 133 dollars and counting while ON SALE is stupid no matter which way you cut the cake."
5193,It's great
5194,"i just love it 
nothing else to say
"
5195,game rocks
5196,"I got this at a time it wasn't bogged down by DLC's that should have just been integrated into the base game. Such a shame too, maybe we'll get a day when people stop trying to shove an unreasonable amount of paid DLC into a game.
Get it when it's on sale."
5197,Amazing!
5198,"Great for putting in mods and making your Computer die
Would recommend"
5199,"Pretty much the best city building game out there
Good base game, workshop mods make it 10x better
Keep in mind it can take forever to load, so play it on a good pc that runs it well
Highly recommend"
5200,this game is great if you like cities and if you like skylines
5201,"good gaem, gives simcity 5 the shame it deserves"
5202,
5203,Super fun and I love how it looks <3
5204,"Very good, the best game. But play responsibly, I really got my eyesight declined because of staring on a lot of small moving objects on a screen without blinking for long hours."
5205,"Great game, especially with mods
"
5206,"I played Sim City 2000 growing up, and this game does everything that I wanted that game to do!"
5207,really good city builder the best one ive played
5208,Reminds me of the original SimCity series. Planning paradise.
5209,"By far the best city building game ever made, it's not even close"
5210,"Probabally one of my favorite games of all time and I definately reccomend. But, its a little bare bones without the dlc tbh."
5211,epic
5212,"Just a fun game , with lots of mods."
5213,.
5214,joc bun
5215,This is probably one of my favorite games of all time
5216,The best city builder with great mods too.
5217,"build city, simcity but advanced :sunglasses: 😎"
5218,Sick game but needs a powerful computer to run with the graphics looking decent
5219,"Played 'em all since SimCity (the first one!), this is the best city simulator of the bunch."
5220,this is one of my fav game
5221,"The city building is amazing. I always come back to it and haven't even got all the DLC yet. I've logged many more hours on other platforms, but the Steam version is the best. The only issue is that traffic becomes a major issue pretty quickly if you are not careful."
5222,"try to build detroit
everything burns

10/10 would buy again"
5223,Addictive !!!!!
5224,piracy is cool
5225,"Fantastic city builder. Doesn't excel at the financial management side of things but for everything else, especially traffic, it's the best there is."
5226,"You can make your civilians drink poop water and die!!! 
Good Game"
5227,This helps me practice how to be a corrupt mayor.
5228,good
5229,"Bought this before DLC was a thing for this game.  I regret it.  Now I feel like I don't own a full game anymore.  If I want all of the DLC, I have to pay OVER $250???  Nah.  Screw you Paradox and your DLC model.  die.  I will never buy another game from you ever again."
5230,"cities with skylines, i guess."
5231,69/69
5232,"It's a city, that you build."
5233,good
5234,kinda eh tbh if youre not a proffesional city planner this might not be your cup of tea
5235,Very dun city builld games
5236,great game
5237,"In my primary school years (90's), I used to wake up early just to play SimCity, and was absolutely blown away by SimCity 2000. I stuck with Maxis and the SimCity games for quite sometime, through to the EA take-over and the confusing social-builder thingy that was SimCity Societies. 

I'd stopped playing games for a little bit, but when I discovered Cities Skylines, it was like that first time playing SimCity and being blown away by the capability and versatility of the game.

Absolutely brilliant, amazing community, highly addictive. I am definitely looking forward to the next iteration of city simulators and seeing where simulations can take city planning games in the future."
5238,All I know is that I cannot get on it by clicking the icon to open it and play and it should not be running but I keep getting message that it is running. What's going on? Who can help?
5239,gg
5240,great game
5241,trains planes and migranes
5242,I can't stop playing....I've lost track of time numerous times. I'll be driving to work and I see road icons in my vision....reality and this game are blurring together...where is my soul?
5243,r
5244,Truly incredible. Very expensive
5245,"Using 3 hours to edit an intersection just to increase the traffic rate from 84% to 85% is totally worth my time. Veri fan game, the pedestrian driving IQ is very high that I have to force them to go other way!!!"
5246,fuck no
5247,loved building cities and some of the dlc add  challanges and more fun with it  deffenetly recomend
5248,Love this game; a true city building simulator.
5249,"very good
"
5250,"This is the game Simcity was supposed to be...
Not too hard to play.
8 out of 10.
Lot's of good dlc too!"

5252,Drivers are maniacs

5260,"this game is super fun to mess around with, and seeing your own city grow is so amazing. its also a great calming game to have running in the background."
5261,"Great game for urban/regional planning with lots of customization through game settings and mods. While it doesn't have very high PC requirements, I recommend playing with your best device if you want the best visuals and plan to have a large city with a high population. Having played on an old MBA, though, the game will run on most devices."
5262,"Its just fun to play, just make sure your computer can held it. Mine can but its gets super lagging."
5263,THIS GAME IS SO GOOD!!! LETS GOOOO IM SO HYPED BOUTTA INSTALL IT RIGHT NOW WRITING THIS REVIEW OUT AND PLAY SOME!!! MY HOURS BOUTTA GO UPPPPPPPPPPP NO CAPPPPPPPPPPP
5264,why the heck can't i give my population the plague
5265,Baller.
5266,"Great game love it
Definitely have a computer that can support big games and can handle a lot of Ram/ CPU/ Memory and all that.
P.S. (do not use a mac)"
5267,     Great game! I've always been a big fan of city builders but never find a good one. This game is a great way to play a city builder. The only problem is thel ack of university and high school development without dlc
5268,"god i love traffic management and municipal finances simulator :) 

(ok ngl hella fun game I really enjoy being creative and creating cities and I spend most of my freetime and some of my not-free time playing this. If I could I'd play 10h per day)"
5269,its good
5270,"cool game, very nice"
5271,Stupid good game
5272,Cool.
5273,Awesome
5274,Satisfying to see city grow
5275,simple fun. makes me feel more creative than i truly am
5276,"If you don't have a dedicated graphics card, ""you gonna have a baaaad time"".
If you have a slow processor and not enough RAM,  ""you gonna have a baaaad time"".
If you aren't able to delegate browsing or streaming to your other devices, ""you gonna have a baaaad time"".
If you don't enjoy modding, ""you gonna have a baaaad time"". Buying the expansions is more like springles on the Vanilla game, but it's not enough to swirl it how you deeply desire it to be.

Either use only on a tremendously good PC, or save up for C:S2"
5277,Its a great game with good graphics.
5278,omg imagine being bad at cities skylines ewwwwwwwwww
5279,Best city sandbox game to play. Make your own city any way you want!
5280,really nice game
5281,"Beautiful traffic jam simulator.

But the game does crash all the time, and the highways are pretty impossible to connect together when they are elevated."
5282,Best city builder atm imo
5283,TE
5284,I loved the roads
5285,Good game
5286,I like to model build a city before I try to make it functional. This is fun to do especially when you see it's starting to look realistic but to do this you got to download a lot of mods which sometimes conflicts or could cause some trouble. I would've liked if the game had those functions build in.
5287,"good
"
5288,"good casual game, and fun to just mess around, but getting actualy good at the game takes way to long, im at 60 hrs still would consider myself a noob, only real downside is the DLC's cost, to get them all you need to spend above 200 USD + the game itself"
5289,it just keeps crashing every time i try to create a new game.
5290,This is an amazing sandbox game!
5291,urban planning go brr
5292,"I have a love/hate relationship with this game in many regards. I could go on a whole tirade about it, but I won't.

The short and simple of it is the base game is kinda weak and mediocre, and the DLC is overpriced and underdelivers. Despite that it's the only remotely decent city builder on the market, so you don't have a lot of options for a game like this.

Lucky you, the workshop support completely saves this game from certain mediocrity. Get Traffic Manager Presidential Edition (TMPE), Extended Road Networks 2, Node Controller Renewal, and Fine Road Anarchy from the workshop. I consider those four mods to be ESSENTIAL for elevating this game to an enjoyable experience. With those tools you can make realistic and beautiful road networks that are much more functional, and when the game's biggest challenge is traffic, that is a HUGE difference to how enjoyable the game is. There are lots of other good and useful mods in the workshop to elevate your experience even further so definitely check it out."
5293,"This game has consumed my life since the minute I bought it; if you like creative sandbox games where the possibilities are pretty much endless, this is a must have. 10/10"
5294,The best urban simulation game ever!
5295,nice
5296,great game!
5297,yes
5298,"what sim city could never be.

it's a touch slow, but tons of fun.

massive modding community."
5299,good
5300,good game. buy it if its on sale
5301,its good yes
5302,Nice city builder game thats worth a try.
5303,dis game fixed my mental problems !!
5304,It really is the best city builder game out there. Just get it and start playing. Mods mae it even better.
5305,After a really tough day at work it feels so nice to get home and know that no matter terribly things went for you at least you will never be as bad at driving as the AI in this game. Hours of laughter to be had watching cars that have simply no idea how to use lanes correctly. 10/10
5306,Good city builder
5307,great game!! takes time to master.
5308,I sit down to play and then 4 hours goes by.
5309,Building goes brrrr
5310,If you liked Sim City at all you'll love this. These guys did the city simulator much better than EA ever did.
5311,cities skylines 6: more cities more skys
5312,"I recommend to try this game if you liked playing SimCity.
When you get to the point when your population starts declining because of the buggy ""crematorium"" system, just install a mod to fix it."
5313,still cant make an interchange
5314,this game is the best city simulator in the world you should try it.
5315,Great game!
5316,Pretty fun
5317,"Very fun game to play, as you can create cities to your liking and also customize cheats if you ever feel like doing that. Sometimes you can create interesting contraptions and it's just a very fun time if you like city builders. It requires an alright graphics card to run so don't expect smooth stuff unless you have a better GPU."
5318,It is a very fun game that I recently got into. I would recomend it for most ages. It is fun but can also be a bit frustrating but thats part of the game.
5319,Engaging and limitless.
5320,"It'd be nice if I could recommend this, but no.
I had hope in it, but this game is too complicated for me - especially for the money.
I hardly play this. My review might change in time but I really don't like this game. To play it well I always have to follow a tutorial on YouTube.
Not for me. Just have my money."
5321,"An enjoyable city builder, that is interesting and challenging to play."
5322,nun good
5323,Cool game
5324,Great and entertaining game.
5325,train go wwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwww
5326,SimCity but modern and better. Watch Biffa and Cityplannerplays for tips and tricks.
5327,"bro  i made a cool city but debt happened :sad:
"
5328,"Cities: Skylines is overall one of my favourite city simulation games ever made. I highly recommend this title if you want to have a relaxing, and fun time. The amount of Workshop content for this game is amazing as-well, and really improves the gameplay!"
5329,"very good and fun game
"
5330,no
5331,"Great game, 10/10, keeps crashing tho.
Edit 1: still keeps crashing :/"
5332,muy bueno
5333,Doctor recommended.
5334,The game is a bit frustrating but there are a lot of features and it can be fun.
5335,It's a great game for non-competitive or creative players. I'll easily kill hours per day just doing weird stuff lol
5336,u make cities thats why it has cities in its nbame (unlike crab game [ps. crab game isnt about crabs])
5337,"Amazing game, so much replay-ability and so many mods. Its not too hard to learn and it is constantly changing!"
5338,"Think about a new city idea.

Install Cities again.

Mess up new city idea and uninstall Cities, again.

Months pass.

Another new city idea sprouts.

Repeat.
"
5339,
5340,....
5341,fun game and great with mods
5342,"its kinda fun
"
5343,"More a way of life than a game. Cities Skylines will absorb your soul, and you'll love every minute of it."
5344,"This game is fantastic - I go through periods where I can't play anything else. I have all the DLC and I have a problem with the Workshop... 

My setup is;
Intel i5-4460
32GB DDR3 RAM
8GB AMD Radeon Rx-580
Installed on an SSD with Windows 10 installed.

With this in mind, if you are a hardcore Simmer, then this game will slow down to a crawl quickly. Of course, it will stay faster for longer if you didn't delve into the Steam Workshop. However, where is the fun in that? And some mods are important to helping the simulation run better. Even then, there are still issues with AI pathfinding etc., resource management and so on. 

It is an old game now and yes, there is still support from the Devs. 

Would I recommend it to all levels of wannabe city planners? Yes. It is addictive on a level I've only come across in OpenTTD.

 I would say, less than 16GB is not a good idea for hardcore gamers - my games frequently max out at 16.3GB! And old quad core i5s struggle too. My GPU however is not taxed at all.

5354,Very good game
5355,"Enjoy this game a ton, additionally, pretty much all the DLC's I've purchased thus far were well worth the price.
There is a little bit of a learning curve near the start, but you'll learn pretty quickly how to fix any issues your city might run into."
5356,I love this game!
5357,"it good
"
5358,I don't think the game was worth the money tbh. It's just 99 percent about planning and building roads. For me that sh*t just gives me headaches.
5359,good
5360,gut
5361,Absolutely wonderful time playing this game.
5362,"Lovely game. As a gay man who like to control the lives of everyone around me, I can say this achieve that goal."
5363,"One of my favorite games. It is what it seems like, you build cities. The graphics are great. The music is usually annoying (but can be turned off). The DLCs really take the game to the next level though, especially the Parks DLC.

If the total DLC combo pack is on sale get it. But start with no DLCs enabled so you can get the basics of this. It is a little different from older Sim City, but is still a city builder. Some of the options are a little stupid in how they impact the game (a little politically biased) but not too bad."
5364,The Best of The Best
5365,very good game
5366,Love this game. Thats it
5367,i mean its good im just bad at it
5368,.
5369,"CITIES!!!!
"
5370,"Keeps locking up every time I try to launch it. And when it does, it won't load saved games. And if it does, you can only start a new game. I really want to love this game, but it's not working for me. Still has problems. Reinstalled the game... Steam, still nothing. Made adjustments to my firewall. And FORGET getting ANY tech help or support from Steam! I'll never buy products from them again."
5371,Game won't work on my pc.
5372,Hey would you like to hear about your city's expanded traffic with a 10% decrease?
5373,DLC to expensive.
5374,fun
5375,Banger
5376,"Very good game for kids, teens and adults"
5377,yyey
5378,"Huh I did not review this game?
If you liked Simcity... Simcity was too small with too much too big buildings. It was not bad, but also not good. Cities is very big if you use the tiles mod. Well Cities is amazing because of the mods. It is the game Simcity should be. I love it, especially trying to make the traffic work. 

There is a lot to do, the base game is already good enough, but with mods. You can loose hours in this game. It can be peaceful. There are some flaws, like with education and work or filling houses. But it are not deal breakers. You can watch many content on youtube to know what you can do about it."
5379,Pretty good
5380,"Very Good game. Fun. Gets boring. Stop playing. Play it again. Commit arson against my old cities.
Rating: 8/10 Base game is fun but it gets old without DLC. Starter DLCs I reccomend are natural disasters, snowfall, after dark and mass transit.
"
5381,
5382,gas
5383,it is fun
5384,absolutely brilliant get it
5385,"great game

5387,so gggggggggggggoooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooodddddddddddddddddd
5388,"addicting, time moves fast in real time when playing 2 hours feels like you just started!"
5389,i love it.
5390,"Just a simply wonderful game, with or without mods. I definitely recommend Hard Mode and some Real Population and Real Time mods if you want to amp up the simulation difficulty, but money was never the challenge, its always about managing the traffic."
5391,"fun
"
5392,Good game.
5393,very good
5394,Best  game  if you  love  building
5395,"It's so fun building cities however you want! 10/10 Reccomend, BUY THIS GAME!!"
5396,2252 hours played says it all
5397,"Took a gamble on this game; loved SimCity growing up and was yearning for something to replace that in my older gaming years. Shame what happened to MAXXIS, but this fills the void nicely. Do recommend."
5398,"Great city building game with pretty good graphics, okay traffic and transit, and good detailing."
5399,good game
5400,Very fun
5401,It's decent for a city building sim
5402,"Best City Builder available. Easy to learn, mastery is rewarding."
5403,"I get lost for hours playing this game. Building up the city and waiting for it to make money and make an impact is so entertaining. And it is soothing. In a world where most games are first person shooters, I find this game very calming. 10/10 reccommend."
5404,Amazing time sink :)
5405,I have problems for this game. First of all it keeps crashing my desktop and its so anoying. Secondly every time i save the game it will freeze then chrash. I do not recommend this game if you want to pay then just barely be able on play this.
5406,it is fun because you can do stuff
5407,"It is a very fun game to play. With the many current and future dlc's, I look forward to a different experience every time I start a new game. I have put over 250 hours into this game and I am still excited every time I play it. I would recommend this game to anybody who likes to build"
5408,fun
5409,city
5410,Too good to be true one of my favorite games but if you put too much mods the game will not boot
5411,Love this game.
5412,nice
5413,Yes!
5414,Amazing experience. Only downfall: very demanding on computing and graphical resources.
5415,"I've been a big city builder fan since the OG Sim City and this is hands down my favorite. My only complaint is with Paradox's DLC policy. While not unplayable on its own, many of the best features of this game are only accessible through the pricey DLC. If you enjoy city builders, traffic simulators, or just kicking back and plopping down zones this is the game for you. I highly recommend waiting for a sale to pick up the DLC though."
5416,"Best city builder game in general. Plenty of maps, buildings, transportation system. I enjoy the general mechanics of the game.
I wish the traffic AI was better but I got used to this.
The DLCs are in general above average and bring a lot of fun at a reasonable price."
5417,"Brilliant game, but plagued with expensive DLC

This game is amazing, the best city builder I've ever played, but getting the DLC is what this game should be like, the problem is that the DLC is stupidly expensive. The mod support is also amazing and just the game itself is easy to get into, but the DLC price is a glaring issue.

8/10, would've been 10/10 if the DLC was more reasonable"
5418,Its a very fun game. I've been playing it on XBOX for about 4 years now and its good to finally play the PC Version a lot more versatile.
5419,this game is the best game iv ever played and i recommend it
5420,Fun all around!
5421,MORE TRAFFIC
5422,fun and realistic
5423,great game. easily still one of if not they best city builders
5424,I love the creative process of making a city and community areas.
5425,nice
5426,"Great game of building and balance. Learning tricks to traffic will be crucial for you, but I find that all to be part of the fun of this game."
5427,"Have you ever wanted to know how Flint, Michigan happened by doing it yourself? No? Oh, okay, never mind."
5428,"MAKE BIG CITY!
BIG INFRASTRUCTURE PLANNING TOMFOOLERY!
TRAFIC MANAGMENT!!
THIS GAME BE MAKING ME CREAM :O"
5429,This game is good
5430,"The game should give you fun, especially this style of play that tires you in the long run. But this game did not bother me and I was very happy with it.
Thanks Paradox team"
5431,great
5432,YESSSSS!
5433,Buy 15% of the total game for only $29.99!
5434,Roundabout simulator
5435,just overall fun strategy game for building cities!
5436,"This game is pretty fun for people who are into the Sims or anything like that, I usually play the game for like a good hour or so before I move on, until I play it again, It's pretty fun but yeah."

5438,5 star

5443,good
5444,"My girlfriend and I were on the verge of breaking up because I would constantly be chatting with her all day, ""yak yak yak."" After buying Cities: Skylines - NOT ANYMORE! This relationship is saved!
When I play this game i'm so silent she will sometimes forget i'm even home and invite her lover over. He's a pretty cool guy."
5445,"i love building cities, pretty pretty pretty good game"
5446,[h1]Best city builder I ever played by now.[/h1] There are only 2 big problems: Paradox DLC policy and outdated engine. Still game is great.
5447,69 stars 😳😳😳😳😳😳😳😳
5448,"Im one of the sim city generation, this games was the next gen series to sim city, but we need a new game wigh better graphics and more base functionality!"
5449,the higher the tax the happier are the citizens
5450,"Game Engine is way past it's lifetime. If you want to play unmodded and have a ""meh."" experience, go for it.
The sad thing is that this game really only starts to shine when modded, but the amount of processing power / ram needed to run a modded city past 100k inhabitants @<10 fps  is ridiculous. 

I'm sad that CS2 is nowhere to be found.. :(

Do I recommend this game? No. I just hope the sales die down and CO is forced to make CS2 instead of pumping out useless DLC for a game that's running on an outdated engine.
"
5451,Liked it
5452,class but unexpected
5453,"My citizens refused to go to a doctor and died of the plague, great game."
5454,.
5455,IT DOESNT FUCKING LOAD
5456,love this game
5457,only city building game
5458,"Just single word, Exellent!!!!

(but use mods)"
5459,pretty cool
5460,the game is shet
5461,it's cool. It's shit without the mods tho
5462,"I really enjoy how this game just lets you relax for hours on end.  You can be technical with your city, or as goofy as you want, within reason.  I absolutely love it."
5463,ultra high graphics for a city builder
5464,very fun and realistic
5465,"I've been trying to play game recently (all settings off and low)and it just does not work anymore thanks to that paradox launcher and few recent updates. Before the paradox launcher the game runned just fine now in Windows 10 its either CTD or completely locks the PC out at the menu, in Linux mint 20.3 native it goes to menu but locks the PC at loading new game, with steam proton experimental and proton v7 it loads the game and then locks the PC.

Don't look at the requirement on steam store they are worthless before the paradox launcher they could tell you how the game would run but now they are pointless."
5466,"Best City Simulator
"
5467,its a great game
5468,"Great city design and traffic/transit sim. Very casual and basic city management game, so if that's what you're looking for you may be disappointed. If you want to model/design your own idea of an interesting/beautiful city and design efficient and effective roadways, it's great. The only essential DLC is mass transit, it's a must if you want to have proper flow of your population around the city, especially if you want to avoid traffic jams everywhere due to everyone driving constantly. 

I keep coming back and enjoying it no matter how much I've played it previously. It is one of the most re playable games that I know of, especially with mods and workshop assets."
5469, A fun distraction!  Casual city management.  Watch the little ant people run around! hehe
5470,"Me and the boys love playing this while in Business management, learning about liability and the triple bottom line? nah get stuffed more like learning how to make diamond interchange and figuring how to fix the plumbing STOOOGE trying to figure out what government legislation is?nah lol were expanding out base of operations and getting oil and polluting wtaer. its a good game"
5471,so based
5472,i dont work
5473,many funs
5474,very addicting
5475,"I've owned this game for years, but I never bought the expansions. Apparently, they decided to lock all of the maps behind expansions, so you can't actually play the game until you buy the expansions. What a bunch of shit. These expansions add up to over 200$ US. I bought the damn game for $20. I paid $20, for game I cannot play. I hope your cities burn."
5476,"the vanilla game is good if you want to make and run a city but the game is way better with mods and addons. with some 20 mods and 500+ assets, you can make scenes and places that look and feel like real life with much attention to detail. its very similar to making a model railway diorama but on the computer."
5477,"Build stuff. Build some more stuff.

Download broken assets and mods. Download even more assets and mods.

Break game. Spend hours trying to troubleshoot what the fuck is broken. Never fix it.

Rinse and repeat. Fun."
5478,yes
5479,the greatest game i've played
5480,It's a really nice game if you want a realistic 'building game'
5481,"It's really interesting game, I loved it!"
5482,i wish we can control the people like act like citzen drive cars like gta 6
5483,"If you like designing things, then enjoy rebuilding them, this is the addictive game for you."
5484,Oh the traffic...
5485,"time killer
"
5486,i love city skylines because it gives users the ability to be able to make beautiful communities with ease ! have you ever wanted to recreate you own neighborhood in YOUR own unique way  ? City skylines has you COVERED!
5487,"the game crashes every time i want to play my world
"
5488,"Amazing Game! I have never been so addicted to a game before. Small things like watching the traffic flow, buildings getting built, watching people go about their day makes this game sooo much better. Mods are the best thing to ever come to this game! It makes it so much more enjoyable and gives depth to mechanics that is otherwise missing."
5489,"This is a very fun game. Lots of content exploding from the base game and the additional packs. I wouldnt say that the pricing for the packs is nessicary however. Over $100 is a lot of money im not willing to spend on a SINGLE game personaly. But this game kept me hooked, and I auplaud it for that. So with that, I say YOU SHOULD PLAY THIS GAME."
5490,Good and complex game.
5491,good game but dlc is expensive
5492,awesome city building simulator
5493,Cool
5494,Great city simulator
5495,"Still the uncontested no. 1 City Builder out there -- a bit dated perhaps, but still king of the genre by leaps and bounds."

"
5554,"I bought this game after watching videos of real city planners playing it and enjoying it. Balancing resources, cost, and citizen happiness is highly addictive. A thriving MOD community offering a steady stream of content (like Japanese-themed in-game objects) gives the game more value. Highly recommended for any city manager wannabes."
5555,Master game
5556,太好玩了，停不下来
5557,the best city builder besides Timberborn
5558,"Flint, Michigan simulator."
5559,"It would be nice if they didn't sell every other feature that should've been in the game as a separate, ~$20 DLC."
5560,Very Fun city planning game

5566,"Game: I compel you!!!  COMPEL!

Me: But I want to have a life...

Game: COMPEL THEE - PLAY ON!!!

Me: -dead from starvation-"
5567,"It's similar to Sim City, but just a lot more sophisticated. So far, the best ""Build your own city"" simulation that I've played."
5568,"This is a great game, i hihgly recomend if you are bored and want to think"
5569,"Base game is very boring , just get some best DLC like industries transit parklife which costs some, and add tons of assets and mods, it would be very fun not cappig."
5570,"It's fun, if you like some micromanaging"
5571,Excellent city builder. The traffic sim part is particularly good.
5572,City.
5573,awesome
5574,Best city builder out right now. Very much looking forward to what colossal order does next
5575,A great sandbox game
5576,"Its by far my most favorite game to play when i get bored and its so adicting
"
5577,.
5578,nice
5579,This game is amazing!
5580,"Loading simulator.. Despite my ""3 hours"" playing this game, like 2 hours were spent loading the game or trying to get the game to work lol. And, no, I don't have a bad pc. My PC is mid-end and I run games like GTA V, ready or not, destiny 2, etc just fine.. I also don't have alot of mods so.. yah."
5581,yisssss
5582,"Excellent city builder, especially when using community mods."
5583,"This game is very exciting, if you like simulator and building genre games. We can build the city the way we want."
5584,Very good game
5585,"i like this game its a perfect game
"
5586,"nice
"
5587," Nice game, 27 hours played, but i do not understand how to get assets working"
5588,yeet!
5589,"Used to be good until update after update, the game gets laggier and laggier to a point where it's no longer playable. Tried optimising RAM but to no avail. This is the only game in my library that does this, Fix the game."
5590,A good modern version of Simcity 4/ 3000. The DLCs make the game go further without getting boring. Already played 80 hours on base + green cities.
5591,insanely addictive
5592,great game
5593,Good game.
5594,great game
5595,ill reccomend it cause its probably a good game but i spend 30$ on this for it to not even load the main menu without crashing (my pc is a potato) but ive heard good things about it so buy it i guess
5596,"If you like sandbox games, you will like this!"
5597,"this is the best city builder available, by far."
5598,"This is a pretty decent city simulator. I've had less than 50 hours of play, but I have seen plenty that would encourage players that like a city building game to build a variety of different cities."
5599,"you're never satisfied with what you build until you download 200,000 mods and create the most basic and generic grid system that will make america start frothing at the mouth"
5600,"Remember Simcity? Remember Simcity 2? Remember Simcity 3? Remember Simcity 4?   Was there a simcity 5?   no idea  doesnt matter maxis dont make shite no more.

Buy this game if you want a new sim city"
5601,so fun to create a utopia!!! runs pretty well on my garbage pc too.
5602,very very good
5603,interesting and fun
5604,I love this game. It is what I do to relax and get away from everyday life.
5605,cool
5606,I like it
5607,.
5608,"This is the best city building game (for now). its worth the price with DLCs  graphics are very good, AI shoud be better but its good."
5609,.
5610,love the game in general hate the traffic problems other than that its 9/10
5611,z
5612,"Very detailed city builder, especially with mods and dlc-s."
5613,very nice helps me fulfill my dream of building cities broom broom
5614,"This is the best city builder ever made and thanks to a recent Humble Bundle, the overwhelming amount of DLC for this game has suddenly become much more manageable."
5615,Amazing game.
5616,very cool city builder
5617,the perfect game for bored me
5618,Good game
5619,fun game
5620,Its better then other games but its very laggy still its best of the best city building games
5621,fun. like sim city but better
5622,Fixing traffic is almost as impossible as fixing my nonexistent marriage
5623,"I love the game don't get me wrong, I'll keep playing it, but I am not buying the dlc's nor would I recommend anyone try this game out unless they have city sim experience before hand, because this game will throw you to the streets as soon as you load in, and you will quickly realize that the road system is a fast track way to making or breaking your city, if this game had better tutorials and didn't lock practically better features behind dlc, I would 100% say buy it, but at the moment, I'ma have to say it's not worth a newbies money."
5624,c
5625,Cool.
5626,Highly addictive. Hours of entertainment.
5627,"super fun, I love building little cities that have roads through the mountain tops (way overpriced tho if u get dlcs)
"
5628,Found this game on TikTok.  Hours of fun!
5629,"making city with ths game
pro
-lots of assets and youtubers to help
-paradox continually support mod tool

cons
-lots of dlc need to play
-lots of bug after dlc release

tips
you should play cities skyline  after  long times dlc and mod stablize game"
5630,Decent
5631,very entertaining and fun
5632,This game is a solid city builder that beats SimCity in every way possible. Just know there's a lot of DLCs for this game.
5633,I mean you make cities and it's actually good at that
5634,"So far I think the game feels pretty boring.

It is okay, but not great.

Graphics are not very beautiful. What is that: Cartoon look or realism?
Building roads, subways etc. is just awful and more than often absolutely no fun and super unprecise.
Traffic is annoying.
Gameplay is pretty boring. It feels repetitive and it is not challenging.
Music is not good, but I turned it off.

Sim City 4 was much better. 

Performance on M1 Max (although emulated) is very good."
5635,bad game
5636,hated game originally now love it
5637,Say goodbye to your freetime!
5638,"Although the game is practically unplayable without mods and I wish they would include many of the utilities mods bring as basic services in the game, overall this is the best simulation game of the 2010s hands down. Wish they would stop cranking out more DLC and instead put time into CS:2 to fix some of the structural issues related to lack of base game content."

Hope they make a Submarine DLC"
5642,"great game no lie,better than tetris"
5643,nice game
5644,...
5645,good
5646,Love this game and the depth of play.  Great community of mods and asset creators.
5647,"Would you recommend this game to other players?
::: Yes"
5648,The game is amazing and super enjoyable.
5649,so addictive
5650,"I don't recommend buying just the base game itself, though if its on sale and some of the DLC's are also reduced, its good fun. 

The game just feels pretty empty. And I wish some of the designing wasn't so tedious."
5651,The best perfect game!

5653,Living that best 'civil engineer' life style whilst living in Grandma's basement. Thanks.
5654,"tons of fun, the key for me after learning things like lane mathematics and the quirks of how the game functions, is to have different goals or ambitions when starting cities. love it, kinda a traffic manager, and thats half the fun :)"
5655,Its Good
5656,It's pretty good
5657,"if you want to lose all your free time, friends, hobbies, and money, buy this game. It's amazing and I love it."
5658,gud game
5659,bbhvgvuvgyuvyugvyb
5660,make city fun
5661,This game is fantastic in every way. The base game is easy to learn and has many aspects to explore. Throughout the games life the addition of the DLC content has taken the game from great top fantastic. Every DLC gives plenty of new content that can keep long time users of the game coming back for more.
5662,"won't run, crashes"
5663,Best CIty Builder
5664,Excellent game on xbox or steam. better on steam b/c of the mods available id say.
5665,.
5666,Better than simcity :3
5667,"game loz fix giao thong dau dau vai ca loz
"
5668,Yes
5669,best city builder not close. mods make it even better
5670,Great for people who love spending time doing sim games
5671,My meditation. the best
5672,"I made a pool of liquic shit and droped it on tha poeple, Funny time. Play game if you lice liquic poop"
5673,a game i can make mine i love it
5674,The best city simulator I've played.
5675,Honestly this game is not good and not fun
5676,"I love this game; it gives you hours of building fun and especially the community is amazing with their support, mods, you name it. Even though the game is quite old already, I would still recommend getting it as it doesn't get old :)"
5677,No comparison whatsoever. Best city builder out there.
5678,"Great Game
"
5679,"So fun!!
You have to learn how to play but i watched jelly play and finally got the game, There are so many tutorials on youtube to do things and if you want to watch City Skylines i defo recommend Jelly's Season 1 on YT"
5680,"Since I was a child, I love playing city builder games. The old ones however, has its limitation. Cities: Skylines on the other hand got millions of possibilities and NO LIMITS!"
5681,Watch some videos on youtube for tips b4 u get started. Can defintely be fun for a few cities also make sure u get mods!!!!
5682,Best city sim out there
5683,Excellent Game
5684,Waaaaaaaaay better than my SimCity 4 days.
5685,"Cities: Skylines is THE very best city building game ever!

It is way more advanced than any version of SimCity ever was. And unlike SimCity, Cities: Skylines has more than two dozen DLCs and Content Creator Packs which add really worthwhile new features and assets to the game.

Cities: Skylines also has the power of the Steam Workshop where you can choose from hundreds of mods which enhance they playability and functionality of the game, plus thousands of high quality assets, including maps, themes, buildings, trees, props, road types, etc. And with a bit of know-how, you can create your own maps, mods and assets.

Because of the content on the Steam Workshop which is continuously being added every day, Cities: Skylines never gets tired because there is always something new in the game. After 7 years Cities: Skylines is going strong with a total of 289,050 items on the Steam Workshop."
5686,not enough chaos
5687,Amazingly engaging and fun game!
5688,very fun game if into building. Many options and you go at your own pace. Can easily eat up all your time getting involved in this game but can be played for years to come
5689,great game period
5690,.
5691,"Came to build a city, stayed to make better roads than my own city."
5692,"good game, but that DLC tho.....$$$$"
5693,it was amazing experience
5694,"If there is a better city builder available, i'd like to know what it is because this is fantastic. Obviously this genre is not for everyone, but if you enjoyed sim city on elementary school computers you'll love this. Traffic is the bane of my existence and could easily be solved with much smaller diameter traffic circles. Recommend regardless"
5695,Game is lame.
5696,A great game!
5697,BEST GAME EVER!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
5698,yes
5699,It was fun
5700,"The first time palying vanialla, traffic felt very overwhelming. 
After moding as much as my PC could take I had a lot of fun creating my own pretty city.
I really would advise everyone to have a lot at the workshop before the city gets too big"
5701,This game is very fun. Try it.
5702,The best city builder around - but still gets dull after about 10 hours if you're playing for a challenge rather than city sandbox. I wish they'd stop added aesthetics and add more complex game-play features instead.
5703,"Extremely in-depth, and mod support is excellent too, so you can go as realistic as you want with your city."
5704,Im playing from work all day. Needless to say now I own all the dlc made by paradox.
5705,"yes
"
5706,:)
5707,.
5708,"A great way to waste your time watching buildings sprout out of nowhere, create highways with tons of intersection to cause traffic and follow the train path across the city you just built.

10/10 highly recommend!"
5709,"very fun and relaxing, youtube guides help a lot"
5710,"Building cities, planning it, organizing it and so on. I love watching my city grow :::"
5711,You can learn a lot of city management in this game. Actually it's a good time killer.
5712,Amazing that's all I got to say.
5713,"Confusing to get into at first, but once you learn the mechanics and how to place down the different constructs, it becomes really fun to manage your own city."
5714,"Such a great game and would love to see this be integrated into MS Flight Simulator 2020, to help fix airports etc."
5715,What a joke. A great game plagued by greed just like any other Paradox product. A lot of the DLC is either lackluster and not worth the price/ downright broken/ should be a free title update. Save your money and maybe if everyone doesn't enable this nonsense they'll realize what they are doing isn't okay.
5716,"Fun game if you're into the sim genre. The vanilla game is missing some pretty important features, but luckily there's a thriving mod community to add the missing functionality into the game. I would recommend having enough ram to play, though. The game crashed (no autosave) while I was streaming because it ran out of memory (16GB), which was a huge bummer."
5717,"Best city builder on the market. I just wish it was more realistic, had bigger maps, and wasn't so memory leaky."
5718,"The learning curve for this game is insanely difficult, but extremely rewarding. My biggest complaint about the game is, while the base game provides more than enough content for a new player (like myself), the path to upgrading is expensive."
5719,The best City Management Game you can get.
5720,"It's like the Sims, you play it religiously for a few days and then drop it for 6 months to 2 years."
5721,best city builder there is.
5722,Got days ago and already have spent hours.
5723,The ultimate city simulator.
5724,poggers
5725,Just one more road... wait how is it 4am?
5726,ye
5727,
5728,"I love this game! I used to be addicted to Sims, and I wanted to think bigger"
5729,"It's a classic. Worthy successor to all the other city simulation games out there. It is better to slowly build up the cities, starting with vanilla and adding mods and expansions one by one to really appreciate the game and gameplay."
5730,Best Game ever
5731,If you like city sim games this is the penultimate game for you. I will always love this game. Its seriously one of my favorites of all time. There IS a money-grabby amount of DLC but you don't need it! The base game is still fun and I put hundreds of hours in on my PS4 before made the switch to PC.
5732,Fire ass game
5733,perfect!
5734,"You build cities. If you like to build cities, then get this game."

"
5749,"Not really a gamer, but for some reason at 40 I decided this would be a fun ""game"" to begin with. I was a huge fan of the Sim City series growing up 20-odd years ago, and this is *nothing* like them. I find it a bit too complicated at present, but I've only invested 6 hours of play in it as of yet. The engrossing YouTubers who play make it seem far simpler than it is When Starting. The game is pretty damn fun and has a very steep learning curve. I highly recommend if you have the slightest nerd bone in your body for City Planning and Urban Design,"
5750,Traffic manager simulator
5751,its addictive be careful
5752,"love it ; )

"
5753,cirlce
5754,Best City building game available
5755,Good game. Not sure about the latest dlc. Base game and everything up till recently has been good.
5756,The best city simulation not that there is a ton out there now
5757,"Best City Builder Game on the market!!! I played this game when it first came out on my parents PC until the game crashed the computer.  Now in 2022, I finally got myself a nice gaming PC and this was the first game I downloaded onto it to play.  From all the packs to the mods this game does not limit ones imagination to create the city of their dreams.  100/10!"
5758,"This game was awesome when it first came out. Years later, the game is unquestionably better after integrating mods into the game, transforming the game and its features. In tandem with expansion packs released over the years, there is almost no existing justification to play a different modern city-building game to date. I highly recommend this game to anyone who likes to design and play cities."
5759,.
5760,"If you are into city builders then this is the perfect game for you but, I am not really a fan of them, which is why I haven't launched the game in almost a year."
5761,"Great city-builder with plenty of great DLC and a vast modding community, but nearing its maximum potential. Looking forward to CS2 on an upgraded engine."
5762,haha citie
5763,careful with that landscaping tool
5764,
5765,Awesome!
5766,"Everything. 
Amazing game."
5767,"The game is amazing, what more is there to say?"
5768,Its a really fun city builder and when you include mods its even more fun
5769,Great game to play with your kids!
5770,city
5771,Up The Flats
5772,Addictive.
5773,A great way for me to get lost in my own thoughts for hours on end.
5774,"IF you enjoy city builders, this is a must!"
5775,So relaxing and so much gameplay with cities skylines! It's my go to game when I want to wind down from a long day of work. Worth every penny!
5776,city
5777,"Cities: Skylines is the definitive modern city builder. It outlived every competitor and has become the defacto city builder for PC and modern consoles. If you are interested in an infinitely customizable and moddable city builder, this is it. It has become heavily infected with Paradox's microtransaction disease, but 95% of the content that you really want in the game is available on the workshop or in the larger DLCs. The game is relaxing and engaging with pretty good performance if you consider the complexity involved in rendering a complete simulation of a modern city. Good luck managing your traffic problems without first watching 10-20 hours of YouTube tutorials."
5778,"This game is really fun, just some things are a bit expensive (not in-game)
such as the mass transit for 12 which is a little expensive just to access more transportation items"
5779,I FUCKING LOVE DESTROYING NEIGHBORHOODS WITH HIGHWAYS AND MAKING THE LIVES OF AVERAGE PEOPLE WORSE
5780,"great game
"
5781,very fun!!
5782,yeha i would
5783,get tortured by traffic jams
5784,Its good. But the amount of money you have to use to get all dlc kinda sucks
5785,"Awesome game, it really keeps you busy as there is always a new challenge you're facing. Really nice!"
5786,good stuff
5787,"A lot of the content you see on the Store page requires any number of expansion packs. If there was a ""neutral"" option I might have chosen that instead but I honestly feel like I was ripped off. I purchased the ""Deluxe"" edition before realizing that I would need to spend up to $250 on expansion packs in order to play challenges or scenarios.  

Cities: Skylines is a decent city sim, good enough to keep you entertained for a few hours if you have ever played games such as Sim City or City Tycoon. For the price of the Deluxe edition, I expected at least a dozen or so scenarios or challenges to complete. 

With the standard or Deluxe edition, you can expect to build cities from scratch. There are no challenges or scenarios unless you purchase certain expansion packs. 

It's not a bad city sim by any means, but after 40 hours of playtime I feel like I have done it all. No new challenges, no random drops of content to keep you coming back (unless you are willing to shell out more $$ of course)."
5788,"Completley stuck, need help instructions not claer"
5789,Find yourself saying: Wait...What time is it!?  City skylines got you.
5790,fun. would recommend
5791,This is the city sim game I was looking for when SimCity came out. The AI isn't perfect but the customization is amazing. Mod it and you have an A+ game!
5792,"Finally goverment

5800,"Because of this game, i might be getting into civil engineering.

It's a bit challenging, but also very relaxing, exept when something goes wrong"
5801,very intreaging.
5802,"This game is great, but it's so incredibly resource intensive if you add ANYTHING onto the game. I have a GTX 1660 and an i-7570, but it still takes a minute to load, and if I quit to main menu then go back in, it won't load and is stuck on the menu screen. Beware of adding too many things to the game, but overall, it's a really fun city-building game."
5803,I hear this is a good game. I've only just started playing tho so we'll see
5804,idk
5805,This Game made me cum over industry
5806,"The game is cool, complete, but kinda hard at the beginning, and the excitement to play it fades pretty fast (at least that was MY experience). I played the game over the course of 3, maybe 4 days and then my city kinda colapsed. I didn't had the motivation to try and save it and much less to start a new one. It's a game that I could see myself coming back in the distant future, but I don't think is my kind of game. I believe it's the kind of game I would enjoy more watching someone else play it that playing it myself (which is kinda fun cause I first discovered this game via youtube gameplays and really wanted to try it).
5/10
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
El juego esta bien, completo, pero algo difícil al comienzo, y la emoción de jugarlo se desvanece bastante rápido (al menos esa fue MI experiencia). Jugué el juego en el en el transcurso de 3, quizás 4 días y luego mi ciudad como que colapsó. No tenia la motivación de intentar salvarla y mucho menos de empezar una nueva. Es un juego al que podria verme volviendo en un futuro lejano, pero no creo que sea mi tipo de juego. Creo que es el tipo de juego que disfrutaría más viendo alguien más jugarlo que jugandolo yo mismo (lo que es algo gracioso porque descubrí este juego a través de vídeos de youtube y tenia muchas ganas de probarlo).

5808,Awesome game!  Better than SimCity!
5809,yes
5810,me like game
5811,its an awsome game even with no DLC
5812,great city building game
5813,cum
5814,"This is next level to the Sim Cities game. The level of detail, customizability, and options are endless here. Would highly recommend playing this game if you're serious about building a city."
5815,pretty good game
5816,:)
5817,gud :)
5818,A great game.
5819,Build city. Fun! Then one thing you don't know how to solve destroys the city! Fun? Yes.
5820,Love it!!
5821,"Compelled to recommend. I rarely review, but Stream noticed I put over 1k hours into this glorious sandbox. If you have a mind for intricate (or not so intricate) city building with a dash of realism and proper micro-management then this is a surely a game for you. Mods galore as well - some of the best mods in the gaming industry with a vibrant & active player community. Devs seem fairly active and responsive, too.  Overall, a fantastic entry in simulation / city management gaming."
5822,Id  recommend this game up till your pop gets to 300- 400K. then you start loosing roads and paths as your hit your limit to items in game.
5823,fun
5824,this game did not work for me but now works and i have $$$ so this is the best
5825,"Makes a done of fun playing it. 
Just watching how they build houses and coming alive. The follow function is pretty good.  

The only problem the dlcs are pretty expensive."
5826,gud
5827,Fun game.
5828,Even just watching the city grow can be a delight ^_^
5829,"Time passer.  If the game doesn't have it, theres a mod for it.  Older game but continually updated and DLC still releases."
5830,Great game for building your own city.
5831,gud
5832,"Paradox won't let me sign in. I cannot say how disappointed I am that I bought this game and now can't even access it.
Stay away from paradox games. total rip off. Took my money and wont let me access account even with a password change."

5841,"If Paradox spent their time working on a sequel to this game instead of bad DLC, I'd be more forgiving. But you really need mods to make this game fun in my opinion. It's always felt barebones to me, like SimCity 4 with 3D graphics and more fancy charts to look at.

I don't know if I'm bad at the game or what, but I always have a problem with trash. I have made a sandbox game, plopped down 30 trash dumps and 30 incinerators, and still end up overflowing with trash before I know it. This always puts me off from playing the end game.

I hope we see a spiritual successor to this game soon, perhaps made by a company that cares more about their consumers.

5842,"game good

5843,This is easily one of my favorite games! I recommend it.

5846,"I like this game, I started off my first city building game on Sim City 2013 and this game is so much more complex and fun than Sim City 2013"
5847,"very good game
"
5848,"Some of the stuff people can build on here is crazy, and it's amazing at killing time."
5849,"is nice game, would be better if the DLCs wernet so fucking expensive *ahem*"
5850,443 hours and just going to put in more. I've been addicted from day one. Worth every penny.
5851,good

5856,"happy game, no bad thing happen. until earthquake unleash poop reservoir and your whole town dies in poop flood. now it is party game."
5857,its building
5858,I like that you think youve only played for 4 hours but really its been 14 and your dog is hungry
5859,too hard
5860,god i love destroying my cities with floods and meteors
5861,its a really good game if you like to build a city
5862,"It gets kinda repetitive after some time, but it's fun anyway"
5863,who tf u-turn in the middle of the fucking road
5864,10x better than sim city
5865,"A very fun experience, good thing to do in order to pass the time.
You start off easy and slow and then you just progress and improve.
Very recommend!"
5866,"I love experimenting and creating utopias or dystopias. The only thing I would change is that when you turn up the frequency of the disasters, they would show up more than every 30 minutes. Other than that, if you enjoy building sims, you'll enjoy this for sure!"
5867,"Game is great. But it’s also very resource intensive

Required mods to make it playable are FPS Booster and loading screen mod.

Game won’t work on 16gb ram, but works on 32 (all dlc)

"
5868,"If you like city building simulation type games, its a must have! The workshop is endless...."
5869,Very great game if you like building and  would like to run your own city
5870,"Too fun, especially for this engineer."
5871,i need a life.
5872,good game but it needs u buy all the stuff
5873,One of the best City Builders out there. Instead of the basics. You basicly control everything. Taxes destruction if you want to have a haven or a run down city. You cannot get enough Hours when playing the game. Not to mention services and how much you want to tax them etc. Theres a lot to offer in this game. Never going back to other city builders.
5874,fun
5875,It's awesome!
5876,:)
5877,good game good mods great community
5878,nice
5879,"I loved playing Sim city as a kid, and this is just the next step up in every way. To controlling roads, and intersections, to designing whole segments of cities to handle demand of resources and goods, growing massive skyscrapers,, and terraforming at will. Great workshop content and mods, pick and choose the good dlc."
5880,"If you are a fan of city building games then you've come to the right game!  I was an avid fan and player of the SimCity series over the years (although I wasn't a huge fan of the last installment), and I had been wanted the ""next"" city builder.  That's when I found Cities: Skylines.  

As I mentioned, if you are a city building fan then there's no need to read further, just get the game!  Things are similar to SimCity but there are a lot of features in the vanilla version of this game that you will enjoy.  You can easily spend 100 hours playing just the base vanilla version but when you add in all the DLC and mods in the workshop the possibilities are endless.  I've spent over 100 hours on the game and only just got my first DLC (Mass Transit).  

Rather than trying to cover all of the DLC and mods available in this review I'll just say that once you get the base game, check out the guides section of the community hub and you'll probably find an answer to any question you have.  The Discussion group is also very active and another great resource for answers.

This is, without question, the best city building game I've ever played.

Note: This is NOT a 'supply line simulator' (best words I could think of).  While you do have to spend time figuring out industry and how good are delivered to your city (cargo trains, harbor, trucks, etc.) this isn't an in depth supply chain simulator.  There is an ""Industries"" DLC that goes deeper into the types of industry you build and where those goods go but if you're looking for a supply chain or industry simulator, this isn't it.  This is a true city builder."
5881,It's good
5882,very good
5883,Since the dawn of this game's release i've always had only one question - WHY TF ARE YOU NOT ALLOWING TO BUILD HIGHWAYS AT A FRESH START!? CAN'T EVEN CONNECT TO THE HIGHWAY PROPERLY AT EVERY NEW GAME!
5884,this game would be so much better if paradox didnt own it
5885,fun but hard
5886,Nice
5887,best city builder game ever. more detail that you can ever go thru and only wish i was as good as some off the pros out there!
5888,"Well compared to other games, Ill say cities skyline gives the users more freedom. However to reach this realism which you see on youtube videos, you would need a lot of RAM as more than 90+ assets could make your pc run low on only 8gb"
5889,"Its wonderful, though only really good at making ultra-wealthy metropolises. While the very active modding community means those metropolises can be very diverse -- offering many many hours of content that feels creative and unique -- the game doesn't have Sim City 4's level of freedom in making small towns, agricultural fly-over space, or lower income areas. These are possible but, as is the case across the board, the level of detailing and micromanagement needed in Cities: Skylines to make areas to look nice can get absurd compared to Sim City's effectively randomized sprite-decorations. But within what the game's mechanics allow, there is a lot of fun to be had, and the introduction of toolsets from the base game's campaigns into the world of modding tools is an amazingly intuitive learning curve; something similar games like Planet Zoo fail to achieve."
5890,Good game
5891,"More than a thousand hours of city building, and I am back for more action!"
5892,its fun

5894,It's a fun game with almost infinite scenarios.

5897,"its very hard to master but its really fun in general

4/5 stars"
5898,yay
5899,The best city builder game out there. PERIOD. You will have hours and hours of fun slowly growing your small little town or rapidly building miles and miles of homes in your huge city. Or anything in between.

5903,good if you have stage 3 terminal autism
5904,"Lots of cash, no loans, low flat tax rate, no extra fees or tolls etc, and no raised budget for anything, no districts, only wind, solar and incineration energy, no bus terminal but a metro line, everybody's happy and people wanna move in. Main challenge has been traffic flow. Just bought a 2nd tile, with a railroad. So, it's been good and it keeps being exciting. The 2nd tile opens up for new stuff: train stations, cargo terminal, a more well planned city grid ... I'm looking forward to keep expanding!

Bad stuff? Well, small stuff. Like not being allowed to plonk down buildings etc first, and then a connecting road. Or unclear view of zones; I just want the colors; green, blue, etc, and nothing else overlayed.

The graphics ... it's there. It's not ugly. But it's not beautiful either. The fields and forests are rather bland. It lacks color. Zooming in, in the city, it looks really good though. But I don't do that. Because there's no reason, for the most part. The thing is, I like when it's more primitive. I used to play first Sim City on the Amiga 500; we're talking over 30 years ago. I liked the top down 2D view. It did not lack 3D. Then came an isometric follow-up Sim City and I couldn't stand it and have stayed away from SC since then. Now with Cities: Skylines, I play with basically the same perspective all the time, and the 3D doesn't really add anything for me.
"
5905,"Don't play this game, instead go make some pie

Ingredients:

1. 6 tablespoons unsalted butter
2. 1/2 cup white sugar
3. 1/2 cup brown sugar
4. 1/4 cup water
5. 1/4 teaspoon cinnamon
6. 1 pinch salt
7. 5 apples - peeled, cored and sliced
8. 1 pastry for double-crust pie

Directions:

1. Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C).
2. Combine butter, white sugar, brown sugar, water, cinnamon, and salt in a saucepan over medium heat. Bring to a boil, remove from heat and set aside.
3. Roll out half the pastry to fit a 9-inch pie plate. Place bottom crust in pie plate; pour in apple slices.
4. Roll out top crust into a 10-inch circle. Cut into 8 (1-inch) wide strips with a sharp paring knife or pastry wheel. Weave the pastry strips, one at a time, into a lattice pattern. Fold the ends of the lattice strips under the edge of the bottom crust and crimp to seal.
5. Pour butter-sugar mixture over top of pie, coating the lattice, and allowing any remaining sauce to drizzle through the crust.
6. Bake in the preheated oven for 15 minutes. Reduce heat to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C), and bake until the crust is golden brown, the caramel on the top crust is set, and the apple filling is bubbling, 35 to 40 more minutes. Allow to cool completely before slicing."
5906,Very good game but i recommend mods
5907,Its a really good game Id recommend it to people who like city building games.
5908,verry good
5909,"Great game, every time i start playing this hours go by hahaha.. this is way better then Simcity"
5910,"Nice game, but with an outstanding community!"
5911,It's scary when everyone in your community gets sick. Very fun. (:
5912,Yeah it's fun I can't lie.
5913,Amazing game very addictive
5914,Corpses and trash keep piling up because I can't think ahead. Very fun game though.
5915,Shooters are for children. Real men manage traffic for fun.
5916,best game osam
5917,Just love building cities and this is the best city builder so far. I hope they add mixed zoning.
5918,Nice game
5919,masterpiece of city building sim game.
5920,"There is no workshop community better, no simulation game with more customization, no developer that listens more, and no other game I would rather spend 24 hours straight tweaking and playing around in. Cities: Skylines is an amazing simulation game that I personally have spent countless hours on whether it be on PC or console. Yet, with the inclusion of workshop mods and buildings in Steam, the game truly exhibits endless possibilities and play styles. While some ""mayors"" in C:S would rather see how well they can get their traffic flow in this city, others (like yours truly) can spend twenty minutes getting the perfect planter and hedge placement in a custom plaza in front of their city's most prominent skyscraper. I really recommend studying city layouts in real life, as well as becoming familiar with how cities grow naturally if you plan to make realistic cities. Yet, this isn't necessary, and you can play the game however you please! Truly one of the greatest games of this century in my eyes."
5921,"Amazing game, been playing it on console version for a long time, finally having a chance to play it with this wonderful range of mods."
5922,"ahh yes cities skylines well i mean you can torture people, thats my favourite aspect of the game

5932,its good however you should get the dlc's to enhance the experience
5933,bird
5934,Läuft nicht mit 16GB RAM Vanilla selbst mit Loading Screen Mod. Einfach beschissen optimiert. Beschissene Engine. Ich kann Tausende GByte große Mods auf einer Karte in Transport Fever 2 ohne Probleme benutzen. Hier läuft das Grundspiel nicht mal mit DLCs.
5935,"Fun, realistic, and more challenging than SimCity"
5936,this game is iconic buy it duh
5937,Demolished 6 houses in the course of an hour with a bulldozer then went home and did the same on this game %100 realistic would recommend

5943,"Absolutely recommend - just see my hours (150 hrs+ in another account)
It perfectly fulfils my dream of building a city belongs to me.
Keep going! Paradox!"

5945,"If you were into simcity or or maxis games, then this is for you. Absolutely amazing game!"
5946,"Coming from a SimCity background, I just love the scope of this game. I love the industries expansion and the developers keep creating new content! I advise you to proceed with caution in terms of which DLC is best. Honestly if you check through the recommendations and watch a couple of YouTube videos about the game, you'll be informed enough to pick the best. Great game overall."
5947,"Good Shit
"
5948,hi

5954,Satisfying Game Ever

5960,"I enjoy this game alot, even though im not that good! lol"
5961,"This game is so addicting. I mean I bought it during the lunar new year sale and I already have 100+ hours on it. In my opinion the game is best on PC so you can experience the many great mods for this game. For me, the game is almost impossible to play without mods. Now about the DLC, the game is fine without DLC but its better with a few DLCs. If you're going to buy DLC I'd recommend: Industries, Sunset Harbour and Campus."
5962, jkmn
5963,"Originally got this game on my Xbox, I love the ability to create a city. Sure, I can't play with my friends but I can build a nuclear power station which is way better"

I have spent over 1,000 hours on this game alone and its painfully wrecking to my emotions when something as simple as laying down metro cannot be done. I get the game wanted to dream big but I, as a gamer, just want a game that works. It's like come on man, just fix your stuff before you add in a million ""upgrades""."

5995,"Great community of contributors and awesome modding community!  The game itself is highly addictive! I've logged a lot more hours than I had expected to but the hours just seem to disappear when you're playing.  Most importantly, it takes my mind off of work. Very satisfying and a whole lot of fun.

6057,Cities Skylines is one of my favorite games.
6058,"https://youtu.be/VlTs2QAhvgs

Writing this view it quickly became clear that it’s hard to talk about Cities Skylines without mentioning Sim City, because for most of gaming history if you wanted to play a city builder you pretty much had to play one of EA’s Sim City games which had dominated the genre practically uncontested since 1993. Sure there’s been other similar games a long the way but none of them managed to capture the magic of Sim City and most of them suffered from major fps problems once your town reached a certain size. That means you Cities XL…

All that changed in 2015 though when a little indie game called Cities Skylines was released and in one fell swoop it swiped the old, wobbly legs out from under Sim City, a series that was already pretty beaten up after a string of poor releases following Sim City 4, and Skylines took the throne as the new king of city builders where it remains to this day with practically no competition in sight.

Now unless you’re totally new to pc gaming then the chances are you’ve at least heard of Cities Skylines which should serve as a testament to just how good the game is, a game still being actively developed almost 8 years later by not just the developers themselves in the form of paid DLC’s that expand the game by adding new mechanics, maps and customizable assets, but also by one of the largest modding communities around, all supported by the steam workshop which lets you download and install free modifications that can completely change the game with the single click of a button.

Now with so few active developers in the city building genre, it’s inevitable that most people make the comparison between Cities Skylines and Sim City 4. Both are superb games and still very worth playing today so I’m not here to say which one is better because, honestly I love them both, but there’s no denying that cities skylines lets you build the biggest cities and brings a bunch of modern quality of life improvements along with it.

You start out with an empty piece of land a population of 0, and as your city expands the game gradually introduces more and more services and critical infrastructure buildings needed to fulfil the growing needs and expectations of your citizens. 

For example in the beginning things like crime, building fires and waste disposal are all non-existent problems of the future, but as your village slowly turns into a town and your town into a city, you’ve got to make sure you meet all the needs of your people otherwise they might start moving out, or in some cases like if they end up drinking their own unfiltered poo water they might even die, which needless to say isn’t a good look for any town this side of the dark ages.

The general flow and mechanics of the game are easy to get used to and everything feels familiar if you’ve played other city builders before, while still being easy enough to pick up if you’re a complete beginner. 

Using a grid system that unlocks a new purchasable square on the world map each time your city reaches a new population milestone, you’re able to take your city from a tiny little village and keep expanding it into a full blown metropolis complete with hundreds of thousands of people spread out over 25 enormous grid squares, where each individual tile is larger than the full game map in Sim City 2013. 



Each map has its own unique biome such as tropical with their long golden beaches, European style maps full of pine trees, and even snowy maps where the lower temperatures create extra challenges as you try to keep your citizens warm, and there’s an optional day/night cycle and weather system which increases demand for things like electricity when it’s time to turn the lights on.

Designing the layout of all your roads and parks is made relatively easy thanks to useful tools like the road align tool that helps keep your roads straight when you need it. If you decent you want some wiggly spaghetti roads to try to capture that realistic feeling of an English town though you can just turn the align tool off and add as many curves as you want to give your roads and paths a more natural look.

You build residential, commercial and industrial zones by painting the terrain where you want them to build and your people take care of the construction and all the busy work on their own without needing to micromanage them, increasing your tax income when people move in and businesses start doing well. It’s critically important to carefully balance all your different zones though to make sure there’s enough workers with the right education to work in the factories, offices and shops. 

Everyone in the city has a purpose and somewhere to be and they’ll try to reach their destination in the best and fastest way possible, travelling realistic feeling distances on foot as well as by car, air, train and the underground to name just a few, so if your public transport system sucks and it’s too far to walk, they’ll either jump in the car and contribute to some probably already insane traffic problems, or they’ll just scrap the whole idea, become unemployed and just stay at home all day living the gamer’s dream.

You can edit pretty much every aspect of your town and the surrounding terrain by using in-game landscaping tools including being able to build dams to harness the physics driven water or flood your entire town in the process, and if you really want to get stuck in and do something that involves insane attention to detail then you can easily find the mods you need to make it happen in the steam workshop.

Basically even in its most vanilla form without any mods or extra DLC’s it’s still a fantastic game, and despite being 7 years old at the time of this review, it’s gameplay and graphics still hold up well today. The music’s funky without being annoying and it offers hundreds of hours of gameplay in a single play through with nearly endlessly replayability thanks to the modding community on top of the already generous amount of content in the game itself, plus you don’t need a PC with nuclear capabilities just to be able to run it at a decent fps.

The unfortunate reality of the situation is that there’s really very few alternatives if you’re looking to get into city builders anyway, but even if the genre was flooded with similar games, Skylines still does what it does well enough for it to be on top, and it’s a no brainer recommendation from us.

6084,"The game is not playable on steam deck! Despite being marked „playable“, the launcher of this game interferes with steam deck controller configuration. Thus, one needs to press the „steam button“ permanently for basic control (eg to use the steam deck‘s buttons for control). This is the only game from my library that really has huge problems when launched on steam deck. So if you plan to play a city building simulation on steam deck, I recommend to skip this title."

6102,"for as complex as the game seems to me, and despite how little i usually like games like this, the rewarding feeling you get when you finally reach a stable community is rewarding, and being able to etch out a city from nothing is satisfying in its own right. I'd like it if the individual DLC's and addons weren't as expensive as they are, being of limited means, but that isn't to say the base game isn't already worth the money"

6111,"Addictive and Entertaining.

Cities: Skylines has me hooked agaun and again. You know you're hooked when you're up until the wee hours of the morning correcting traffic flows and making sure your Parklife DLC park looks parky enough.

Game is incredibly easy to mod and there are some great mods to make the vanilla experience a lot more bearable.

Loads of assets too on the workshop.

Great community of builders and YouTube. Biffa and City Planner Plays inspired me."
6112,best city builder ive ever played
6113,This game is the mecca of freestyle city building. can do virtually anything with these tools and mods available.  only thing this game is missing is some sort of multiplayer feature where i can share resources with friends or even some sort of trading system.
6114,I demolished a children's hospital and replaced it with a luxury shopping mall
6115,it aight
6116,"Best city builder simulation game you can find, far surpases the tragedy of what happened to Sim City. Im not a huge fan of the crazy amounts of DLC, it's extremely expensive to get them all (200-300 euro!). 

But im still going to recommend it, the game is still very very VERY good even without any DLC. Pick a few essential DLC's if you like and then you are set to go. And if you win the lottery you can then buy the rest of the DLC! ;)"
6117,good game
6118,Very very engaging.  Very well done.
6119,"Yes and No
gameplay is:
build small town --> try to expand, big city boom --> watch as every building gets abandoned because of noone collected the dead, even though you have dozens of cremas.
constant need of commercial but they can't fill up their shelves because there are no goods to sell. also, industry can't sell it's product because there are not enough costumers. yeah.
but it is fun to build spider-web like tunnels and bridges for the pedestrians."
6120,"I really want to like this game,  but it's another $300+ money grab from paradox.  I refuse to support these business practices."
6121,Probably the most addictive city builder I've ever played after 2500 hours over 7 years. I just love how well stocked the Steam Workshop is for assets you can add to your city and the mods to turn off parts of the game and turn it into a sandbox. Plus the DLCs have added a lot of great functionality to the game over the years. Cities Skylines for me is a true escape and I couldn't recommend this game enough.
6122,"The game is somewhat shitty, the modding community is the best in all steam platform imo. Love it"
6123,A bit better than simcity 4
6124,my favorite city building game
6125,"One of the best city building games. The only thing that bothers me is that sometimes cars are ""stupid"" and not use all the available lanes. Have to use mods to overcome this and even then is not perfect. But overall, great!"
6126,"I haven't played a City Builder since Sim City 4 and this game has exceeded my expectations. I play console games a lot and play Cities:Skylines on a MAC. The DLCs and the option to download free mods and assets mean you can really make this game your own, and the options are endless. I have only just touched on the possibilities of this game and know I will be playing it for a very, very long time. I would thoroughly recommend this game."
6127,i forgor 💀
6128,"yeah, it's ok."
6129,if you like city building you will love this.
6130,The best city builder game I have played
6131,I like this game because you are a builder and build a city. This game does have some DLC's/Add on's and mod which will or can help your city.
6132,"First city building simulator game I've ever played and I've loved it, 10/10 time waster."
6133,The best game.
6134,"As far as I wanted to love this game, I just can't. Not at this point. Here are the reasons. Naturally, don't get attached to my opinions. Play the game for 2 hours, if you like it, buy it. If not, refund it. I just wanted to publish a few thoughts of mine, that's it.
- DLCs in general. There are perhaps a few of them that actually mean something. The rest are cut-out content that should've been added along with some kind of bigger expansion that would include things like industry overhaul and such.
- Close to none economy play. Perhaps other people have a different experience but here's mine: you build stuff in order to be able to build more stuff. That's it. Financial optimizations and such are superficial, they're merely a cheap, low quality flavor instead of being a real, meaningful mechanics. For instance take SimCity 4. Because you had to specialize regions in SimCity 4, overall experience was much deeper. The game actually required to be mindful over the development process. Having a cool, basic agglomeration that serves as a foundation for other smaller regions? Fine, but be wary of what you build in other regions as people from your main city could emigrate and lower the overall GDP, rendering your favorite city in a minor (or major in some cases) recession. Now, here in Cities Skylines I just haven't experienced anything similar to what SimCity 4 offers in terms of economy.
- Over the top emphasis on traffic optimization and road infrastructure. You build roads, and more roads, and even more roads. I get it, it's a great feature cause modern cities are like organisms requiring a proper blood vessels to operate. Nevertheless this combined together with aforementioned lack of economy-oriented play makes the gameplay dull and repetitive.
- Poor, CPU-heavy performance issues that are somewhat connected to poorly programmed interface. There's mod to fix this but still – performance in a city building game is a must. Letting that stuff rely entirely on modding community is a laziness.
- City services are just... dull. Normally most city builders used to operate around the idea that as long as a service building's effectiveness radius overlaps with housing, it works as intended. Now... it might've worked 15 years ago but for a modern game, it feels shallow. Services such as police, firefighting teams, garbage trucks, sewage system, healthcare and education aren't just ""place the building and make it's radius overlap the housing"". They also have their own effectiveness based on things such as city's GDP, education quality, supply system and negative factors such as corruption. If Paradox's games can work based on overall effectiveness variable, Cities Skylines could operate around it as well. But it doesn't."
6135,I would highly recommend for people who want a city building game. I'm really enjoying it and I feel like i have invested my money in a good game really.
6136,"Nice game, plays well bit adictive"
6137,k
6138,I make city city bad city good yeah
6139,good ig
6140,"Cannot get enough of this game 
"
6141,good
6142,"Great fun, much better than SImCity in most ways."
6143,"Losing is easier in the tutorial, than the rest of the game"
6144,"built town, infect people with bad water"
6145,reocmmend
6146,"This is arguably the best realistic city building sim money can buy. The engine is great and the mods are great. I really have no complaints other than perhaps the DLC policy but that aspect of the game isn't as bad as, say, EUIV."
6147,"I love this game.  Reminds me of old Sim City where you actually BUILD a city...  HOURS of fun and good to come back to when you want some ""Mindless"" fun and see what you can BUILD."
6148,"Best city building game.

6151,City went bankrupt after earthquake. ggs
6152,I love this game too much
6153,game is fun it is a great stress reliever. one thing though is DLC is annoying but you can still have fun without it. overall good game
6154,"This is the worst game I have ever played, I absolutely implore you to avoid it"

6156,fun
6157,"this is amazing, i finally got a few dlc's and it makes the game more lively, the base game always felt like there wasn't much to manage. kind of just waiting around a lot, but with a few dlc's i have new systems new things to build, it's great! also, some of the chirps are miss spelled lol. like, i enacted the fire detector policies, and they said fire edetectors lol. that's not a miss type on my part, that's what it says in game XD anyways, i love this game."
6158,"A beautiful city builder with unlimited possibilities. Several expansions! Always evolving community pool of assets, maps & mods. Only con is cost of acquiring all official content. Even on sale expect to pay about $200 for all of it. Base game is still highly enjoyable and worth it! You can often find this on sale under $10."
6159,"This game is utterly spectacular. The game's mechanics are more realistic than any other simulation game I've ever played. The graphics are amazing, which is why this game needs a powerful processor. Most of all, its fun. I bought this game 5 days prior to this review. With my 12-hr job, I've played this game for almost 3 hours everyday. The only problem is that it's very addictive. For that, I'd give it an 8.5/10!"

6176,"I loved Sim City as a Kid, this game makes that game look pathetic.  I play this all the time, love it!!"
6177,"i apparently played this game once before, and idk how did"
6178,"Are they too scared to make a C/S 2 or what? A second one is needed if not only for a clean fresh workshop.

Game is fun on its own, I think you can grab it for something like $7.50AUD from ""places""; which is well worth it. There is a very large mod community which makes the game the best city builder still around, this has caused me to invest in not only further DLC but a whole new computer that can handle the damn game and load everything in under 2mins :).

Paradox Interactive are not scared of discounting literally every product they've ever made and they will email you to inform you. Often dlc can be picked up for as little as $5AUD with newer dlc being more expensive.

Seriously tho, Countries:Skylines, Earth:Skylines, Universe:Skylines; are computers not good enough yet for the second step?"
6179,Yes
6180,It a very fun games but can be very challenging at times mostly with traffic

6183,Build city
6184,meh
6185,Very good and easy to play. Those who enjoyed the OG Sim City days will love this as a near perfect alternative.
6186,"It's not that the game itself is bad, as much as it's poorly marketed. I'm itching for a city builder. This is less of a city builder and more of a traffic simulator. The fact that you have to build a city to generate the traffic is, perhaps, the least polished and least enjoyable aspect of the game. Great soundtrack."

If you love Building Sim, then this is your game. Make sure you can run the game (ignore the min. recuirements, you don't want that). It's pricy, but don't forget the endless hours you can play this game, the gameplay and the huge amount of mods and assets there are. Just buy it on sale."
6192,Very epic
6193,"This game is really good, i only played it for 42 hours but i watched so many videos it feels like more than 42 hrs. The content it gives you is great, and adding mods makes it even better and then when i have the money im going to get the Industries DLC and then the others and it is a really addiciting and amazing game!"
6194,First city builder game and am quite enjoying it and its really challenging at the beginning but don't let it put you off because it does get easier with more experience.
6195,good stratergy game
6196,i like city
6197,Is good
6198,Fun and challenging game for any age.
6199,"Honestly, this is my all time favourite game.  It's modding potential is unlimited, the DLC's add a ton to the game, and honestly can get lost for hours on end just making a custom freeway interchange.  There are minor things that are limiting in the base game, however, with the massive CS modding community, your imagination is the only limitation to what you can build. 9.5/10"
6200,"I played a lot of Sim City growing up, and I think Skylines is a great successor. It's better in probably every way and probably the best city sim out there."
6201,Build buildings while building buildings built for building and build buildings by building built buildings inj sequence with other built buildings
6202,$292 CAD worth of DLC!?
6203,Great Game! Super fun building cities.
6204,great game hours and hours of fun
6205,"sim city except its a test ground communism and shit volcanoes, or volcanoes made of shit. 





oh and i saw a orphanage and threw fifteen meteors at it, 
except this didn't happen in game"
6206,"This game is elaborately-designed on it's detail,from citizen to house,vehicle to architecture,it reveals an authentic model of an on-going city under player's grip.I've spent a lot of time to immerse myself in this virtual world day and night but I don't consider it as squandering time,it's a way to bring me peace from effete.
Overall,it's undoubtedly an outstanding game for players who like city builder games.I'll keep finishing achievements."
6207,best
6208,"This is a really good game. It successfully simulates being a mayor in charge of a small town. You start out with $70,000, a small place off the highway, and a lotta grit. As you play, you grow(starting with water and electricity, and going to monuments!) 
Overall, this game is really fun and I would love to get more!"
6209,"Excellent city building game! The best I've played. I love building custom road networks and the capability to form organic/curved road patterns. There are a few minor modifications I would like to see, (i.e. expanding the small road option of ""1 lane on way, 2 lanes the other"" to the larger roads as well. 4 lane roads with ""2 lanes one way, 3 the other"", etc.) really minor changes. The game is incredible and has so many expansions to explore to make your cities truly one of a kind."
6210,Awesome game
6211,I tax the masses and they cant do a thing about it. 10/10
6212,Simply the best.  Better than all the rest.  Better than anyone I've ever met.
6213,Love this game! Super fun if you like building maps and meeting objectives.
6214,"I was used to SimCity, and Cities Skylines is its best successor! Awesome interface and endless possibilities."
6215,"Incredibly addictive, fun and challenging."
6216,Poo
6217,"This game is actually really enjoyable, if you have a creative personality. I'd say it's more fun to play with the infinite cash sandbox mode though."
6218,"Great game, love designing cities and then seeing them be inhabited!"
6219,tis hot
6220,Awesome
6221,The penultimate city builder. Lots to offer from the base game. And even more from the expansions.
6222,vgndgrds
6223,"Didn't think id enjoy it as much as I have, awesome game, keep making new cities tho, need a map to really catch my eye
"
6224,good
6225,
6226,"I am just getting started with 1021 hours so far. It is very time consuming, with great results.  There is a great community with lots of help and samples of what can be done.  I just love Cities Skylines it's one of the best sim game I have ever played! And I would recommend this simulation game to all ages."
6227,"I GRINDED FOR LIKE 12 HOURS STRAIGHT AND MADE 150% SURE I SAVED MY GAME AND WHEN I CAME BACK THE NEXT DAY IT SHOWS NOTHING IS THERE AND I HAVE TO START A NEW GAME. I WANT A REFUND
"
6228,good
6229,The best city building game. There are many features (arguably complete) and also a lot of mods. And the last one is of course a very cool graphic.
6230,Love it!
6231,good
6232,it is good
6233,"While the game content looks attractive, the terrible road building mechanics makes me quit before any buildings go up.  Roads are the foundation of any clean city layout.  Planet zoo and coaster suffers from this same problem and I won't play them either."
6234,qwedfgvd
6235,"[h1] Awesome City Builder Game [/h1]
[hr][/hr]
[b] Very addictive game and so much I can do in the cities. [/b]
All aspects of city faithfully simulated with enormous amount of quality community contents. Easily invested 10+ hours and just to get the hang of it."
6236,"the game is great, but the dlc is a little too expensive"
6237,good monkey graphics
6238,everything but we should have a mall dlc just like the airport dlc
6239,barbaras
6240,amazing
6241,AMAZING!!!!!!!!!
6242,no i would not recommend this game because i got frustrated with the sewage the power and the water systems but it seems like a good and fun game if you know how to play it ive personaly seen youtubers videos and it looks fun
6243,Good game

6247,Best City Builder EVER!
6248,n
6249,Excellent!
6250,Cool
6251,"yes very good
"
6252,im still learning but im enjoying it
6253,"Like the SimCity games, but with far more control. For those of you looking for a city-building simulation game, this is probably the best thing out there right now."
6254,Excellent city builder. After owning it for years I figured why not give my half cent! It's a great time killer and with all of the community additions the play is endless and possibilities  multiply daily! Looking forward to the eventual release of 2.0 (here's hoping!!)
6255,"build fun, depht sad"
6256,my game won't open for some reason:(
6257,"An extremely fun city builder with so many options to customize, it creates a completely different experience with every new city! The DLC is well thought out and in my experience such a game changer. This game is one of my two favorite games, hands down. Recommend x10."
6258,fun
6259,Advice: Good Traffic Flow = Good City.
6260,
6261,"The best city building game ever. (ON STEAM!) 
If you really like to get into the details I recommend you to check the workshop page. Tons of stuff, mods, tools and props are available for the game. 

The only disturbing thing is the high price of DLCs. Oh, and eats your ram a.f. :D"
6262,"Awesome game, addicting and simulates constructing a functioning city very nicely. I definitely recommend people to try this game out."
6263,yea its good
6264,"Paradox has always made a good chain of games, This is sure one of them among HOI4.
This is a good game when you want to build a city. The Workshop makes it 110% More fun with new content and location specific Houses, Shops and Commercial Zones in general.

You have so much liberty for your creativity that it puts me in difficulty too. With DLCs you can build Parks, Ferries, Trains and more, I personally like playing sandbox mode and not the game itself."
6265,love this game
6266,"you can do terrible things to random people
"
6267,Great game to play!
6268,You build the city
6269,pog
6270,"Made the Twin Towers ,but sadly a plane crashed into them."

6272,cool game but got addicting so i uninstalled

6274,"i find it this game to keep me focused on productivity & exercise my patience for seeing how something gets finished and works out. i enjoy time spent playing it.
"
6275,epic
6276,"Such a good game for city simulation as their are amazing different features in the game. I highly reccomend it
"
6277,"Hard to learn but after watching a few YT vids and etc you'll learn
its fun to play a totally different genre of game"
6278,duh
6279,best in class city simulation game
6280,"Up on the rooooooof, up on the rooooooof."
6281,I do it better than the government of my country
6282,Really the best city building game I have ever played in the last 30 years.
6283,Love the game! now waiting for the next Cities Skylines!
6284,You won't find a better city building game.
6285,Great
6286,basically a small country
6287,"srxtuykl,m"
6288,I can build a City. Also Cause Disaster by Breaking the Sewer Pipe.
6289,funny poop lake game
6290,"Cities Skylines is the best city builder yet, It takes everything i loved from SimsCity 3 and 4 and expands upon it with the addition of mods and alot of great DLC packs."
6291,yes
6292,Good Game
6293,its great
6294,buy
6295,"Please add multiplayer, not VR. The game is a bit annoying without mods but with mods it's unstable :|"
6296,It's fun
6297,It's a fun game more modern than Sim City.
6298,I never thought my dreams would be nothing but traffic management
6299,Love this game. Even better with the workshop items can download.
6300,"One of my favorite games of all time, Would gladly recommend it to anyone who hasnt played it!
Sure it has some flaws (Fps, Ram usage)
but other than that its a pretty solid game!
If you liked simcity/like simulation games, This one is 100% for you!
10/10
"
6301,"Very gud game.
I recommend it.
Niceu Niceu"
6302,"Great game! many hours of real life can be lost to it.
"
6303,"  good
"
6304,Fun
6305,This game is AWESOME.  Puts the EA sponsored mess to shame. Developers are great and work hard to continue an awesome game.
6306,first couple hours are rlly frustrating because you have no actual economy so ur just loosing money but than you get into it and slowly start figuring it out step by step problem by problem.
6307,"damn, very good game"
6308,fun
6309,"Great city building game with many add ons to download, just make sure you have enough ram to avoid error messages. Here because of the GOAT Keralis"
6310,"Great Game, one of my favorites actually. There is so much to do and it gets more challenging as you move on. The DLC's add a lot too and the game is constantly getting new ones. The mod community are fantastic and make the game even more immersive. Love this game, Thanks Paradox and Colossal!"
6311,Game is great fucker
6312,"Great timekiller, perfect game to put on some music, build a city, and just relax. Until your city inevitably runs out of workers, or has a massive traffic jam, or everyone dies at once, and you just start again. I honestly love it."

6314,Good
6315,Great Game
6316,i love this game its really in depth and i think if you liked sim city you'll love this.
6317,"If you have a few months/years of your life to waste, no family, kids or wife then this is the game for you. If you have a family, GF etc.. don't worry, you wont remember them.. This game eats your time as a feature; let me just go here and build an overpass, ooohhh let me make a custom park, ooh oh oh customer AIR PORT!!! 
And if you use MODs, it's worse....  

Best city builder hands down."
6318,Good Game.
6319,super nice game but only for who had all DLC
6320,"From the boomers who originally had Sim City as their first city builder game years ago, to the new kids on the block trying these types of games out. This is what Sim City should of been, DLC aren't needed but most of them are nice additions to the game once you have mastered the base game play. Literally hours of fun and struggle as you make your city the best city around."
6321,"Overall, great sim. Plenty of detail and flexibility. Mods supported and strong community. Needs a decent pc or it's a bit slow. If you like city building simulations, I can't recommend this enough."
6322,it is good game
6323,...
6324,"My brain is just melting when trying to understand this game's traffic system.
"
6325,"This is a very good game lots of thinks you can do. really detailed houses lots to do 
"
6326,"this is a very good city builder game, my favourite part of the game is the natural disasters."
6327,"very good 
"
6328,Best game if you like city builders
6329,ok
6330,Very good game
6331,"Simcities, but better. Except of music"
6332,"Great sim game, build your dream city while relaxing.
great list of mod enhancements."
6333,"Train good, car bad."
6334,I am trying to remake Gotham .
6335,Goods!
6336,I enjoyed Sim City a lot more back in the day.
6337,"road
"
6338,"While I do not like how it is broken up into DLC, the overall game is fun and well made."
6339,"too hard and grindy, so just get prebuilts from the workshop"
6340,It was noice
6341,What is there to say that hasn't already been said? A masterpiece of a game.
6342,Hours of fun
6343,I'm the best mayor my city has ever seen! My people love and adore me!
6344,good game
6345,"It is the best game I have ever played
"
6346,"When I get bored of Factorio, this scratches the low-effort creative itch"
6347,"game is crashing even on gameing pc
not because of a update
but for some reason happen"
6348,"I love this game, probs one of the best"
6349,Traffic go brrrrrrrrr
6350,Yes.
6351,Yes Girl
6352,Grew up playing Sim City. I feel this is more realistic and customizable.
6353,It is a fun and sometimes very challenging game.
6354,"Great fun, loads to do and works on my imac, so perfect"
6355,Yeah it's kind of good.
6356,"its a hard game for beginners tho, but its fun"
6357,"This game will not start unless I start >>STEAM<< in ADMIN-Mode. You have to be effin kidding me. That is some serious problem, and so I will delete this trash (thank god I wasted only a few bucks for this crap, and still I regret it now of course) and leave a negative review for this buggy hell of a software."
6358,gud
6359,chaos
6360,amazing games a chill out game good building city game as well would recommend it to anyone
6361,im going to be under your bed tonight

6366,Soothing.
6367,"Very addictive, if you're into building and contructing infrastructure, customizing it to make it as efficient and smooth as possible."
6368,"Good game, Sad to see so many DLCs are basically a must to unlock all city planing capabilities"
6369,It proves I don't have what it takes to run a city. But I can try!
6370,"The game loaded properly 1 time. Since then, when the map loads up it just starts flashing and never appears"
6371,"This is a great game, I can let my kids someday plat this one."
6372,"Game is alright Mods are amazing Mainly traffic mods
"
6373,"If you ever wanted to be a god ruled over by their subjects, this is the game for you!"
6374,horeeee
6375,Good game but I would recommend a good computer for a better experience
6376,yes no
6377,gg
6378,My favorite city builder.  Been playing for years
6379,"Would I recommend this game? If you would like to grow your population to 100,000 then cut off all water supply, electricity and pollute the ground with sewage while raising the tax rate to 29% then removing all roads leading to the highways and remove fire/police services basically making your city turn into Gotham City when Bane held the city hostage with a nuclear device, then yes I would recommend this game to annoy who would like to inflict your personal pain on innocent simulated civilians."
6380,This game made me realize my apartment IRL is on an arterial road which is horrible city planning.
6381,Its like crack
6382,"exactly what i wanted, but the placement of things like drill, industry things were just straight up boring and repetitive"
6383,"It's a good game.  It's the Sim city we all wanted.  

The only problem is the absurd amount of DLC.  It costs over $300 for all of it.  WTF!!!"
6384,yes.
6385,Cool
6386,"Better than Sim City, that's for sure."
6387,like
6388,"Nice builder, fluid gameplay, lots of possibilities."
6389,It is great but Cities Skylines 2 is need to be on the way. I'm tired of unsufficent mods and crashes due to these.
6390,love it
6391,This game is like smoking really good crack
6392,"As a big fan of the Civilization franchise, this game satisfies the desire to go back and play Sim City again. 

Great aesthetics/art style and a robust feature set make this a must check out for those that enjoy 'City Builders'.

Just watch out for all the extra DLC Paradox Interactive will want you to buy. There is a lot and it isn't inexpensive..."
6393,It's better than simcity for sure :)
6394,good game
6395,Fun game. Can be addicting.
6396,I likke it
6397,Game is very engaging with it's custom content from the community but the mods can crash the game if you're not careful.
6398,Peng game
6399,Nice Game
6400,Its a good game
6401,"i love this game from the start, don't expect to be the best because you will cry;)
"
6402,I mean it's alright
6403,ok
6404,great game if you like sim city......
6405,very nice game
6406,"kok
"
6407,gud
6408,Good
6409,this is a opening game you need to solve the problem in the city you build and get many money to build up the city
6410,"THE BEST GAME I HAVE EVER PLAYED ,"
6411,"This is not a game. 
This is a commitment. 
If you ever thought you could love something that is bad for you i encourage you to get Cities Skylines.
This will consume your waking hours and rob you of the evening ones. 
You'll start playing it on your phone, then the console, then realize it is on PC, buy it AGAIN, and painstakingly try to create your urban utopia.

Traffic Manager for life."
6412,Super fun to hop on for a bit everyday and improve your city. Even more fun with mods.
6413,pre good ngl
6414,it cool
6415,the graphics and gameplay
6416,Hands down best city builder out there. I love zooming in on an individual person and watching them go about their day. Such a beautiful game.
6417,if you like bilding this is the game
6418,"I've been wanting to try a city building game for a while and Cities Skylines was the most attractive choice I found. Turns out I got it for free at some point on the EG Launcher.

Tried it for a bit and ended up buying it on Steam as well as some DLCs.

Can't believe I slept on this game for so long."
6419,Frick Europe. I will not make a roundabout NO MATTER WHAT
6420,Yes
6421,Its great
6422,"I like making buses, but traffic is always a nightmare"
6423,"This game is pretty good. The DLCs are very expensive. However, you can get a fulfilling experience from just the base game with some mods.

"
6424,Its A great game really fun and i think that if it got another update it would be amazing
6425,"I am a very patient and detailed oriented person who enjoys building things, so this simulation is perfectly suited for me. It is relaxing yet challenging, and very easy to pickup but takes hours of playtime, experience and watching other builders to become good."
6426,"Me gusta mucho este juego, Super adictivo y entretenido 😼😸"
6427,mucho funny
6428,good game
6429,I made a massive hole filled it with poop water and people drink it. At least it's better than drinking water in Ireland.
6430,"The best city building sim to date. Be mindful that it will take a lot of your time. You to need explore, do some trial and error before you can get the best and satisfying city. So many possibilities on how to play this game. You can it vanilla + DLC. Or you can utilize the workshop and use all the assets,mods,tools etc created by the players."
6431,bb
6432,Lots of fun
6433,"I was a always a big fan of the old Sim City games. This is everything I could have asked for. My favourite moment so far has been messing up the water management. At one point I had a flood go through my city purely because I was overfilling a river with sewage. Later on I poisoned my whole city by adding industry all around what had previously been a reliable and fresh water supply. I'm 55 hours in and utterly addicted, Any time something bothers me I just go to the workshop and mod it into oblivion. Amazing game."
6434,"Absolutely amazing!
"
6435,tops
6436,"Loooove this game. Been playing it on and off since launch and it's only gotten better with time. Add in the DLC and incredible amount of mods, and it's easily the best city builder out there."
6437,yessssssss
6438,have a 6 lane highway...... lets only use a single lane
6439,kesel konandeye
6440,Good simulation

6442,"Okay, so this is a beautiful game. Zooming in gives you a tiny town movie experience. I highly recommend this game, BUT, you definitely have to play and go through the tutorial from SimCity4 in order for things to make more sense. Once you get the hang of the game in SimCity4, then you will have an easier time on Cities: Skylines. One thing I would like the game to do is offer traffic solutions. I absolutely hate trying to fix all the traffic messes in BOTH games. Only solution I can think of to fix the traffic problem is to send a disaster under the God mode. City Skylines will give you gorgeous views and sceneries and prepare to spend many many hours playing the game off and on while doing chores, just cause you can't break away from it. You also don't have to buy all the DLCs, just buy a few to start then add more stuff later as you improve your game. My thanks to the creators. I am a forever Sim fan."
6443,Fun endles builder game. The mods you can install make it endlessly playable.

6447,"A difficult game, needs many hours to know how to properly manage. Also I would recommend get the steam version of the epic games one because of the vast steam workshop, there are many great mods and assests are on there!"
6448,5 stars
6449,Better than some city simulations. Traffic is a little nuts though.
6450,"a lot of fun! thoroughly thought out and the community is pretty incredible. no need to have career aspirations, just play this your entire life"
6451,"I have loved the city builder simulator in specific SimCity like from the OG SimCity I had to run from a DOS command prompt. Quite frankly I was hooked on simulators, I moved to the Sims and that was the best stuff since scliced bread that had been invented only a short 10 years before my Dad's birth, needless to say the whole genere incompassed my playing habits; I can go on about auto racing etc but that's beyond the scope.

I LOVE Cities:Skylines after I got kicked in the mommy daddy button with the so called ""advance purchase of SimCity 4; if I need to explain that horror that was of that games launch and subsequently its collapse consider yourself in happy bliss. 

I didn't want to take Cities as a replacement thinking it as a cheesy and substandard. Let me testify this game rocks. Truthful on all levels I think the devs made this game almost unplayable without some of the DLC'S. Don't get me wrong you don't need all of them; you just to be able to know the ones that you tailor the experience with. Bad news is I don't know a way to arrive there I went rich Boi and got the DLC and NO RADIO STATIONS PLEASE; just throw on pandora, Spotify, Amazon or who ever floats your music Jones instead save your cash for those sale DLC's.

I must talk about the big pink elephant 🐘 in the room the WORKSHOP!!!!! WoW the people who are active in the workshop are fantastic. They all do deserve some cash here and there; the work they do is totally outstanding in most cases and should be recognized 👏 so please donate when you can. I donate because I cannot begin to create some of those structures and would love to learn its that amazing. Closing out my glowing with some clouds review I heavily recommend this game to all city builders; the modding community is awesome use them and help thems peeps out 🙏; and lastly there may be no direct sandbox mode you can tailor this game within the devs guidelines to make it the most superior product on the market today. Oh I forgot HAVE FUUUUUN YAAAAY!!!!!"
6452,"I am addicted to the game, send help"
6453,Amazing game to play and chill
6454,Fun game.
6455,best city builder
6456,i build many house
6457,awesome game
6458,"yknow i think that sometimes this game is like sometimes like yknow? its not always but sometimes, kind of and not really. its pretty sometimes but like its ok sometimes not always maybe sometimes not that often but kind of."
6459,"[h1] If therapy was a game [/h1]

Need I say more? This game is the single greatest relaxing/stress relief game I have ever played. Being a Civil Engineering student, I just love having the space to be creative with ideas and see other people show off their much better ideas. The mods just add to the style of play so much I don't know how I could ever go back to Vanilla. The only reason my gametime isn't higher is because I don't have the PC to cope with it."
6460,Top tier game - great detail.
6461,Fun if you like that sort of thing
6462,"very highly recommend getting the ""TM:PE 11.6.4.8 STABLE (Traffic Manager: President Edition)"" steam vvorkshop mod to help vvith traffic"
6463,good
6464,.
6465,Very addictive
6466,Is good!
6467,"If you want a game about building cities, you will not find any better than Cities Skylines. Great for gamers who want the challenge of city management/development, or to creatively construct the cities of your dreams. Very robust mod community as well."
6468,"I built a city and then wondered why people were getting sick, and then it hit me. Man, why is the sewage going into that water pump, so I hired a couple of dudes to move the water pump and they did. After that debacle there was a rise in crime because the police being underfunded, wait wait. Sorry I was talking about Los Angeles, back to City Skylines. Honestly it was pretty fun (:"

6470,everything
6471,Could sink hours into it.
6472,it was a fun
6473,"Good city building game, just make sure ur PC has enough RAM to play this (I didn't) :("
6474,yes
6475, no
6476,Best with mods
6477,Basically the Platonic ideal of a city sim game
6478,I LOVE THIS GAME.
6479,"Great city builder game, it's essentially everything that Sim City was missing."
6480,i lost pieces of my soul to traffic management
6481,Lots of fun managing traffic
6482,i liked they cranked  90s by making it like sim city 4000
6483,i may or may not have flooded the city with sewage
6484,i like it good game
6485,NICE
6486,"I really wanted to leave a negative review for the memes, but its a good game. I've enjoyed it a lot and the mods make it even better. :)"

6490,big funny
6491,"So this is basically Civ 6 but more open. It is basically unlimited in how you want to create a city, and it takes a while to understand. I would whole heartedly recommend this game, but try to snag it when its on sale, cause its pretty pricey."
6492,"Great game, worth every penny. It has its flaws, but the community managed to fix most of them."
6493,"tasty tasty yum yum
"
6494,"very fun
"
6495,Yet to be consumed by EA
6496,"So much fun! Especially if you have the Natural Disasters DLC, you dont even have to be good at building/city planning just download Ragnarok, a mod that enhances Disaster destruction, download a random save game from the workshop and have fun! I burned all of New York City!! Definatly recommend if you like city building and destruction!"
6497,e
6498,Good city builder. Too many dlc though.
6499,hyghg
6500,"Excellent and fun. Easy to understand and fascinating to handle. I only wish it was easier to understand NPC's pathways, because there is no way to efficiently handle traffic."
6501,funsies
6502,I've played an embarrassing amount of hours  of this game....
6503,"My first experience with Cities Skylines was overwhelming. I started the game when a friend of mine suggested it to me. It was difficult for me at first, and I thought I had a steep learning curve before I started to understand and enjoy this game. I didn't play the game for a couple of months. I stumbled upon a few Youtube videos of the games from City Planner Plays and T4get. I was captivated by how they built their cities, and I learned a lot from them. I made my first city by replicating one of T4get's, which is how I got started. I learned about the game while trying to build my first city. I bought a few DLCs, which I thought would give me a better experience. I want to become a vanilla builder. I wish there were some options that the developers added into the game, such as: 
being able to unlock more tiles. 
The content of the traffic manager mod. 
There should be an option to select different trees and plant them as a batch instead of planning trees individually. 
More road-building tools. (like in the mod) 
A more realistic population and day/night dynamics. 

I'd recommend the game. The community looks big, and the players seem mature compared to other genres. The lack of developers' attention to the game can be compensated by the mods made by the community (there are a lot, and you can literally do anything). I prefer they added most of it to the base version of the game, at least the tools and options."
6504,addictive
6505,"Built a peen shaped city, 10/10 would recommend"
6506,Good game lots to do easy to understand and fascinating in general 100% recommend.
6507,love it!
6508,great game!
6509,no brainer
6510,Build City cool!
6511,the best making city game ever you have to play it!
6512,It's good.
6513,"I used to play Sim City, and Sim City 2000. This is like that, but modern, and probably better. I'm a very happy lad. Also I fully intended to give it an hour or two the other day and played for 6+, so you know... it's a time vortex."
6514,Noice
6515,Great game
6516,"Sewage City, megalopolis with few property damages. Enjoy the great view, and wonderful smell."
6517,gud gaem
6518,pretty nice game. i haven't played this game in a while. recently came back to it and it is still as good as i remembered it honestly. recommend it 100%!
6519,"As a longtime fan of the Sim-City series, I can say without a doubt that this is a good city building game and I would definitely recommend it."
6520,"The best successor to Sim City.  Meditative, challenging, replayable.  Reviews require a minimum word count so these are words.  I want chicken, I want liver, meow mix meow mix, please deliver."
6521,"i have to much time
"
6522,"Overall, I believe it's a very fun game to play in order to pass time."
6523,"great game, even after nearly 100hrs playtime still very enjoyable!"
6524,Super fun
6525,Basically Clash of Clans if you had to worry about pollution
6526,Great game for fans of old-school SimCity like myself.
6527,You can play as traffic and actually drive around your city its pretty cool. If youre a meticulous type youll love it. great for putting your own music on and chilling out
6528,"Build city.
Loose all your money.
Enjoyment."
6529,Hard
6530,stop cutting off power randomly to my city bruh
6531,Excellent many simulation good town recreating!
6532,amazing game really fun right now its the only game i find enjoyable so ima keep playing it and you should too also the dlcs are awsome and make it much funner
6533,Love this game! Best city-building game ever. I could build almost everything that I wanted here.
6534,good
6535,excelent
6536,
6537,You need DLC's to enjoy the game to the fullest and the game is too dependent on mods but overall this game is awesome if you have a creative mind.
6538,"Cities: Skyline just doesn't have enough DLC, mmkay.  And that makes me a sad panda,"
6539,"@DEVELOPERS:
I have a 270k city and the game wants to see me fail and im really pissed off!
Let me explain:
 - at first, 230k, death waves began, so i disabled them with a mod.
 - then, at 240k, the garbage service wasnt working, so i disabled it too.
 - at 270, a lot of houses are burning and the stupid fucking shit firemen arent doing anything!!! im impatient 
   and this game pisses me off!!!

the stupid service buildings are spawning maybe 2 of 15 possible vehicles, although there are dozens of dead or burning people in their neighborhood!
Do something against that please!
kind regards,
a former fan of your game"
6540,It's a good game.
6541,Its a very fun game. 100% reccomend buy NOW bc it so good. get some mods too
6542,"very prone to crashing unexpectedly with mods, save often and dont go over-board."

6547,good gaem
6548,Challenging and immersive
6549,I have had my eye on this game for a few years. It went on sale a few weeks ago so I bought it. No regrets here! It is a big step up from Sim City.
6550,good game
6551,"Roads roads roads. Build roads, manage traffic, let it take over your life."
6552,"It is really so, so fun. Just be careful about getting sucked in: I bought it two days ago and I have not spent 17 hours of my weekend building my first city. That doesn't even count the hours I've spent watching youtube videos of all the crazy things people do with this game. I highly recommend if you are into city building."
6553,epic
6554,Sometimes you just gotta city those skylines.
6555,Nice Game!
6556,Very good city builder/manager. Worth the price.
6557,"This game was amazing starting out in vanilla, and when i added modes to my game it got even better.
"
6558,very good game even better with mods!
6559,its satysfting
6560,"Quite an exhilarating and relaxing experience, however, it can indeed be stressful whilst experiencing the unfortunate fate of not having the required knowledge to resolve your fine established metropolis' problems. Apologies for poor knowledge of the english lexicon."
6561,A fun sandbox game. Would recomend
6562,"Keren Diadain promo lg dong dlcnya

"
6563,"There just really isn't all that much to this game. The world is basically stagnant and only you can impact it. There are no impactful outside events, no excise cost to tearing down part of your city to replan it. Pollution is exceedingly easy to deal with and there is never a scarcity of anything ever. It is not challenging once you figure out how to navigate the game and interfaces, which are extremely simplistic and leave me hungry for more data."
6564,"Only 3 recommendations are better traffic AI, Better game engine, and bit less pricey DLC. Other than that, it's my dream City builder."
6565,"meh, not enough black women"

6569,Just So Good :)
6570,g
6571,"Uso Steam solo y exclusivamente para usar Cities Skylines, un excelente juego si lo pruebas no podras dejar de jugar"
6572,i like building cities
6573,"Simcity 5 is better.
""But you have more space""
Ok, but there's no difficulty at all. Absolutely none. People discussing this issue in forums call it a ""city painter.""
At least Simcity gives you a bit of a challenge in balancing your budget.
Also the DLC's. What a garbage business practice. Not a fan of that, Paradox."
6574,"The way that you see the process of the city that you are building, going from a small town to large city is just awesome. Fun game, for anyone who likes these kind of games. It's really calming and healing in a way. If you want to get away from anything for a while, this is the ideal game for that."
6575,"Very Fun game, the base game is still very good without the DLC packs. If you want to dd more features to the city to make it more detailed. I would definitely recommend buying some DLC packs. But if you are on a tight budget. The base game is very fun and has plenty of features to make your city look great!"
6576,I drowned a whole city in a crater of sewage.
6577,great game
6578,Best city builder I have ever came across.
6579,yes this game is one of those things you play then take a break then play over and over again
6580,Good game!
6581,It`s a very good game if you like to build Cities and create your own mini world
6582,good game

6586,Great simulation game.

6588,epic
6589,Can be fun with some DLCs it is relaxed and an easy game to learn and play
6590,you can build the city
6591,i like cities
6592,"I love it it does take some skill to get a profit from the cities but when you do it is awesome. And there are endless amount of mods to work with and really upgrade the experience, updates are consistent and dlc are really good
"
6593,"I don't appreciate how the game bombards you with ""oh you dont have this DLCs, you wanna purchase them you poor boy?"" just in the main menu.

Also, the DLC quality has been dropping pretty significantly in recent times. DLC mechanics tend to be less integrated into other systems in the game, especially other DLCs (the last decently integrated one was Industries imo). While this is understandably done to not force players to buy other DLCs in order to enjoy a certain DLC, this results in mechanics feeling shallow and forcibly copied.

The game is overdue for an overhaul. As it is, the development seems to lean heavily into eye candy instead of (somewhat) immersive mechanics."
6594,good
6595,Good for ngabuburit
6596,"gud
"
6597,"Asset Editor doesn't work at all ,cant draw roads or build parks or bldgs.

6598,Load with 4000+new assets and 30 new mods. Game crashes. Get mad. Do it all again
6599,"Purchased because of the DRM of simcity, stayed because of the quality"
6600,Fukin sick mate
6601,"For someone who really enjoys simulator/city building games, this is definitely one I'd recommend. There's a lot of parts of the game that open up as you progress and therefore, helps the game not get old. Personally, I enjoy playing in the infinite money/sandbox option of the game and building my city up without the fears of debt. :) If I were asked to give a criticism, the only frustrating part of the game is the money mechanic. It's very easy to run out of money and infinitely go into debt, which ruins the fun. :/ Overall rating: 8/10"
6602,i love this game. you have the freedom to do what ever you want here.
6603,nnkln
6604,LokiLand
6605,"Best World Building Game on the market, also really glad its available for steam on Mac! The game can still grow (in respects to the graphics and overall running of the program) even though it's already very much integral. Recommend this game for anyone interested in economic, sociological, and civil sciences! Also it's quite worth acquiring the DLC's but get bored with the base game first! (04/2022) M.D'arc"
6606,bueno muy
6607,best game ever
6608,you can build city
6609,siiiiiiiiuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuu
6610,"This game is a great time waster - if you like the idea of building cities and whatnot. If whatnot is not your style, kindly keep moving! :) Seriously, it is a good way to spend a free hour or day or year."
6611,It's good.
6612,big city very good
6613,GOOD GAME ULULULU
6614,
6615,nice
6616,A fun city builder with plenty of replayability (and tools for wrecking said city if bored later on) ;)
6617,It the best i spend 4 hours in a row
6618,Yeah i love cities skylines especially that you can create a tsunami of sewage water and drown the entire city 👍
6619,"This is the sequel to Sim City you always wanted. There's no better way to explain it, except to say it's very good at demonstrating how critical road planning is to modern cities... it's eerily accurate for such a simple game.

I see a lot of people complaining about DLC... you can ignore that. The base game is fine, and in fact there are a number of mods in the workshop. For instance, the most common complaint about the game at launch was that you start on a big grid, and you can't buy all the ""tiles"" to unlock building on the entire map, maybe out of concerns for performance. So the first mod I found in the store was unlocked all the tiles. Basically any complaint you have with the game is solved with a mod. So in terms of the base game, things are great. If the devs haven't fixed an issue, the community did. Things are solid.

The DLC should be seen as supporting the devs, no more no less. Paradox are famous for selling a lot of ridiculously overpriced DLC. But if you just think of this as, you liked the base game and you want to support the devs, wait for a sale and have at. For instance, one DLC pack added interesting new features related to snow, so that winter is much more impactful in your game. Sound fun? Maybe you want to pay for that DLC. If not, don't worry. That's basically all of the DLC in a nutshell. So I'm not worried about ""greedy"" devs. This isn't like EA's versions of these games where 99% of the content of the game is locked up in DLC. You can truly just play the base game and get 100 hours out of this title. I have 25 hours on record, and I've played a lot more at friends' houses, and so forth.

Want custom maps, gameplay mods, additional prebuilt intersections and facilities? Free community mods are right there in the workshop."

6621,Hey vote for me for rerun and I'll continue ruining this city!
6622,Simply one of the best city building games ever made. Add to that a fantastic modding community and it means that your imagination is your only limitation.
6623,good game. get it NOW
6624,"Bob
"
6625,"everything is just fun. but I would love it more if there are an additional options about police, hospitals and firefighters buildings, to control what types of cars and helicopters you have same as simcity."
6626,my city got sick so i distroyed my bank acount and city
6627,it isn't a new sc4 but it's good enough
6628,rate good game
6629,fuck mtx
6630,i can finally blow up all the citys located in malaysia
6631,"Better than sim city ever was, also has a great modded community. Mods and DLC really add to a diverse play experience."
6632,"Usual Paradox formula of an okay game on release quickly ruined by paywalling features behind 30+ DLC packs. If you can get the base game and every single DLC for less than 20 on a humble bundle, go for it. Otherwise, one of those DLCs will contain a nearly required feature or addition, and you'll have a bad time."
6633,I suck at infrastructure planning.
6634,"The game has become unplayable since the update in early 2022. Loading the game actually takes between 45 minutes and three hours, upon which I have to get rid of at least twenty error messages in extremely sluggish popups. I had no issues before the update, something has been changed dramatically. My system has dual X5680 Xeon cpu's, 96GB of DR3 1600MHz RAM in triple channel, a GTX 1050Ti 4GB gpu and a Samsung NVME SSD on a PCIe card. There should be no problem at all to play Cities Skylines, my other games run as smooth as ever. I say Colossal Disorder. I tried to get a refund, because the seller broke the game. Guess how that panned out...."
6635,"roads? who needs them. not me, no thanks."
6636,very fun traffic simulator
6637,bean
6638,"One of the best city sims ever. Water is fun but deadly. Dams kind of hard to use. Great game, nothing else comes close city sims wise."
6639,This is hands down the best city builder I've ever played. The modding community has shown it so much love.
6640,good game
6641,good gaem bre
6642,Game was so Nice. that I had to play it for at least 69 hours.
6643,I unironically started looking up city planning documents to improve traffic efficiency.

6645,very fun played it for 8 hours straight o.o

Comment:
This game is really good for those who like building cities, it has realistic graphics if it's set on max, never got any bugs or glitches with the game. Although the game needs a really decent computer with at least a dedicated graphics card, I've been playing this with an Intel integrated graphics 630 and it was running really bad, I was getting 20 frame rate per second and sometimes it drops more, it was really frustrating for me. I stopped playing this game because my system wasn't powerful enough to support the game. Overall, this game is really worth it to buy if you are into building your own cities but you must have a dedicated graphics card to play it without any lags."
6647,Muy bueno
6648,
6649,"the game is fine, but ive never in my life seen a game just f*ck around and delete my save while i was sleeping"
6650,Good game
6651,Usually play on PS4 since I have a cheap laptop and it is very slow. On PS4 I have all the DLCs. Just started on PC since I kept seeing streamers on Youtube using mods and all and it looks awesome. Wanted to try it. Just having a few mods makes it really nice to play and makes my city look more realistic. I would definitely need to have a better PC to support the game. Love the game and all the assets on PC.
6652,"Crashes all the time, tries to squeeze money out of everything, jsut a horrible, horrible game. Don't waste your time or money on this abysmal product."
6653,Beware this game is terribly addictive but a shed load of fun

6663,nice and relaxing
6664,One of the best city-building games IMHO.  Great modding community which keeps this game fresh.
6665,I don't know how to play...
6666,"everythings great and i got it for only 200inr for christmas deals
"
6667,good game
6668,"Nobody likes paying twice or three times or more in DLC/Asset Packs what they paid for the base game just to get what many consider the basic functionality of the game, I certainly didn't.

Do I regret it? 

No i have no  basic impulse control or appreciation for the value of my time or money."
6669,"It's simply the best at what it is - a pure city builder. If you enjoy anything of that nature, you will enjoy this game."
6670,good

6679,gamee goodd
6680,"I like this game, only just dipping my toe in the water but it is fairly easy to get into if youve played simcity etc, 
I'm rubbish so far but it has a nice curve and I do keep getting drawn back. The progressive release of new buildings and concepts keeps it moving in game, and the graphics whilst not outstanding are crisp and clean."
6681,"very bussin. This game has so much drip it was hired by water to drip because of leaks like the leaks in ur basement noob. I recommend this game to people who are from earth. People that are human. People that have many bobux. Bobux are a requirment. people with no bobux are noobs, Are you a noob? yea, think about that,"
6682,yes
6683,Not very nice! no
6684,Gud
6685,"I love city, get on sale."
6686,i get to destroy city oh yes

6691,"it no have sandbox mode, but its kind of good"
6692,"This city builder is currently the best in the entire world as of 2022, which is also what many others believe. Although some features are missing, they can be compensated with modifications downloaded from the Steam Workshop."
6693,A highly costumizeable dream maker
6694,ye
6695,like
6696,really fun and interesting game
6697,Very addictive game for city builders and strategists alike.
6698,"Great game, but sometimes the traffic makes no sense, and Im spending time fixing it when I could be doing other stuff."
6699,got this for my lad and even i play it when he's not here
6700,"Everything you should expect from a ""sim city"" type game. Only every irritating thing from similar games are either fixed, or can be fixed with mods."
6701,"Best mind-meditation and -occupation while listening to a podcast or audio book (optional). Highly recommended do this meditation once or twice a week and watch your very own city grow into something more complex and beautiful than you would have expected. Also quite easy to learn given the size, options and complexity of the game."
6702,Its awesome
6703,VEry fun game to play ! lots of mods and content  to fiddle with.
6704,"It's a really good game, but the only downside is that higher district buildings leave spaces which makes the city look a lot more uglier than it needs to be."
6705,"gut
"
6706,quite the poggers game
6707,i bought this game 3 days ago and ive already played for 18 hours
6708,Best city building game
6709,pretty fun
6710,it is immersive and fun game to play
6711,"By far, one of the best city building games around."
6712,scratches an itch in my brain that really brings me joy
6713,Mostly very fun and addicting but also sometimes frustrating when you don't know what you're doing
6714,I wnaa nut
6715,really good city simulation game
6716,"game is really good and kinda fun with the endless money mod. the only issues i have is with limited money and the natrual disaster DLC, Money is hard becuase i'm constantly losing money, and the natrual disaster DLC is famous and new players will be upset becuase the DLC Is $20.00."
6717,⠀
6718,very fun
6719,Really fun and endless ways to play <3
6720,This is the most fun game I have ever played ( if you are a city building maniack)
6721,Great
6722,"make successful ciity, lure them all with a good economy and good property values with high industry. Build 1 million gallon sewage mountain in the dead of night when they least expect it. let the sewage flow and build...then delete the wall and watch them all suffer for being middle class."

6731,i like pretending im a slum lord
6732,build :D
6733,LOVE IT
6734,Build a city for 4-6 months getting really in to it. Then it will always start crashing.  Spend 4-6 days failing to fix crashing issue. Get very angry and frustated and don't touch the game for 6-12 months. Then repeat this cycle over and over and over...
6735,Hello! This game is simply AMAZING. It is the best of its type and I highly recommend it for anyone interested!
6736,Best sim city I've ever played
6737,good stuff
6738,i LIKE IS GAME
6739,Great city builder very enhance-able with mods and new assets
6740,I like how creative you can be in this game. The in-game mods are also great to have somewhat of a creative mode just to build a city and experience with all the tools the game offer.
6741,"W
"
6742,good game
6743,"Ok, this game should come with a warning "" Will cause sever pleasure and entertainment"" - will follow with hours of designing cities and followed by a wonderful community.  I am serious of you are thinking about purchasing this game.  DO IT.  It loved by many and played by a lot of great people.  I give this a 1000+ thumbs up!"
6744,It's the best city building game there is
6745,Amazing city building game. Probably the most complete and fun city building game I've ever played. Lots of mods to help customize gameplay. A must for any sandbox lover.
6746,Can commit genocide. Has my approval
6747,"It's a relaxing yet highly addictive game. I'm currently working on unlocking all the buildings and earning some of the Steam Achievements - it can be challenging at times but still very pleasant. I have some of the DLC's; Parklife, Industries, Campus, Green Cities, Sunset Harbor, After Dark, and Mass Transit. I have not purchased Airports yet, and I don't have many of the creator packs - or music DLC's, I usually play my own music anyway. So, yeah, I highly recommend City Skylines."
6748,Been playing on and off for a year now.  Can't wait for part 2.
6749,buildings
6750,"Cities: Skylines is all about building huge, bustling cities, but they don't need us to save them from disaster unless you don't read any of the tutorials and build a congested nightmare like i did my first go around. 10/10 Would recommend."
6751,"amazing game, but let down by truly awful traffic Ai. 

If you get the traffic manager mod and have the time to learn it then go for your life!

Mods mods mods is the way for this game."
6752,One of the best city building game ever made
6753,Best city building game of all time!

6776,good game please play
6777,Great time waster.
6778,very nice!
6779,i love to watch black men twerk.
6780,good
6781,"I highly recommend! Ive spent hours creating my city, watching the civies drive or use public transport. Seeing the city working is quite relaxing. The only thing i dont like, is how unbalanced the economy is, but... Atleast for me, i try to avoid thinking about money, and just giving the best resources to my city."
6782,Very good game
6783,MY GAME WAN'T WORKING I TRIED BUT IT NEVER WORKED
6784,good
6785,"Amazing, Could play this for hours"
6786,Love the game. Time passes and you don't even feel it
6787,create and enjoy my own place
6788,best city building game. i recommend it to type A types like me and my dad :- )
6789,"yes
"
6790,Best City Builder you will ever play.
6791,"good game for logical brains for sure
"
6792,the best city builder ever
6793,good
6794,"As someone who really enjoys city builders this is easily the best one out there for modern theme.
Say what you will but it's easy to get into and you can go pretty much however advance as you'd like with the DLCs being release every now and then to keep the game up to date and exciting. IF you somehow get bored from the content the workshop content can inspire you and take your building to a whole other level.

In my honest opinion this is an instant classic game.
Just remember to save your game"
6795,"Good City Building game, would recommend it to people who have spent their childhoods building out imaginary cities."
6796,If ea went this same route instead of what they did. they would have never lost there fan base to what i would call A MASTERPIECE OF THE SIM-CITY WORLD. i would highly recommend this game to anyone that has played simcity before. 10/10 would be my score.
6797,"Great game, realistic and beautiful!
Great sens of detail, altought it would be good to have instructions on the basic mecanics of the game and how the IA works on the supply chain, the basic city organization and so forth."
6798,Fun game!
6799,"I had all the dlc, and was up to date. Left a couple of years, and came back, and need 125 dollars to update to everything.... alms?  xD"
6800,nice game
6801,this game gay asf
6802,Nothing like killing your citizens with their own fecal matter!
6803,best city builder
6804,cool city build
6805,"You start playing in the early evening on a Friday... next thing you know it's the afternoon on a Saturday.

This game is a time machine. Use with caution."
6806,"Great game, lots of freedom with creativity and layouts
"
6807,its a good game.
6808,one of the most hardest games
6809,wowie
6810,Apart from the fact that this has a lot of DLC which makes it pricey if you want a city building simulator with a ton of modding potential with the Steam Workshop there is no game quite like this out there!
6811,"Absolutely fantastic game. Ultra realistic and great graphics, 10000/10. Definitely the leader in the city builder game category."
6812,"I think this game is calming.  If you're looking for a standard city builder with possible expansions, click here."
6813,"its pretty good game, a bit slow compared to cod but overall relaxing time"
6814,It is great
6815,good.
6816,its good for 2 cities after that you begin to take it seriously and then you progressvily make more cities and want more and more money and before you know it your remaking LA in this game
6817,A+ - would recommend
6818,"This is a very time consuming and fun game!
i have spent so many hours building and designing cities. I enjoy how it gives you so much freedom and features to build. I am more of a mod player. I recommend it is more fun with mods. But if you do so it will break your PC. I have had many saves go corrupt due to updates and mods breaking. 
Overall one of the best city games for gameplay, but with visuals Sim City wins. The basic building designs aren't that realistic or attractive. with recent DLCs Paradox has made better improvements and attractive buildings.
I still recommend it to all who just want to waste time building and mirco-managing!"
6819,Fün
6820,"they love me even though i fill their water with shit. Their children are polluted with nuclear waste and they praise my ability.be a monster,your people will love you for it
"
6821,VERY NOICE
6822,its a nice game to play when your bored
6823,eeeeee
6824,"had this city builder for 4  years and all the DLCs ( not radio Stations) before this I was a sim city builder since Sim City came out. This sim is very easy to get into if you have played any type of builder, there are lots of YouTube vids to help you out.
The amount of asset's and mods is very large,. This builder is great also for people that like to detail things or just build in sandbox mode.

If you on the wall about it pick it up on sale."
6825,ewww
6826,"I'd be lying if this game wasn't fun. Out of all the ""good"" city-builder games out there, Skylines is one of the best.

But...

I feel a real disconnect between the base gameplay and the creativity that this game has to offer. Cities: Skylines has an enormous amount of potential creativity that the player can take advantage of, but in the case of some of the buildings, and especially for the HUGE amount of DLC this game has, it's hard to effectively use that creativity in making a beautiful city.
For example: Imagine you have 200,000 ""money"" from taxes or whatnot. You could, theoretically, use that amount of cash to build a subway system, which'll only make you, say, 2,000 ""money"" a week. On the other hand, you could use up those 200,000 bills to build an office block, which'll make you 20,000 ""money"" a week.

It's much more efficient and financially stable to just keep building houses and businesses around your city than to go ham and release your creativity by making something more challenging or abstract. Why build airports, bus stops, harbors, or other buildings that spice up your city, when you could be making cash-over-hand by using that money elsewhere? Hell, there's really nothing stopping you from making the entire map an enormous megalopolis of the basic bread-and-butter house and workplace, and outside of the vague ""happiness meter"" in the bottom right, there's really nothing that'll force you to make a beautiful city instead of a bunch of squared-in buildings and apartment blocks.

Cities: Skylines is fun. It's fun because of the creativity it offers to the player. But because there's really more incentive to -not- be creative, and just build the bare minimum, it's difficult to find a balance between enjoying yourself, and doing what's pragmatic.

Maybe it's just me. Any tips?"
6827,The most amazing simulator I've palyed so far with new DLC making this a better experiance and bringing new additions to your city

6829,"it's a great creative game and I love it, but it disappoints me in terms of assets - I make a lot of mistakes"
6830,Best city builder ever!
6831,
6832,I love this game! This game is so fun! It is one of the best sandbox games out there! My city is getting bigger! I love not supplying my citizens with proper health care!
6833,very good game
6834,"If you grew up playing Sim City, this is like that but on a much higher scale. You have so much control over what you build and how you build it. The availability of mods is great and most of the DLC adds great content to the vanilla game as well as challenges."
6835,jhvgvy
6836,"just like real life
"
6837,"Best city builder I've played in a long, long time. For me, it's a 10/10"
6838,"I've been playing city sims since the 1990's, and this game takes all the best features from them, refines, and delivers an awesome way to spend time. It's on the casual side of city sims, but that's what I like most. Grab a coffee, watch a city grow."
6839,best game for making your dream town
6840,"Infested with DLC adding things that could have been basic game updates.
Frustrating launcher that delays opening the game, and often time has to update before you can play.
Gameplay is overall solid, missing quite a lot of basic features like airports (which you can buy through DLC). Thankfully, it is moddable to fix the rest of the issues with the game."
6841,"Really great city builder, you can play fast and keep trying to grow, or you can stop paying attention to demand and level out slow. You can really get into the visual details and nice little touches once you get into all the mods, or you can just keep going with others map packs and saved games. Replayability is super high and suitable for many playstyles is what I'm sayin!"
6842,awesome city building game. no other competitor
6843,modlarla güzel oyun
6844,Love it!
6845,"This game is horrible, it sucks you in, it will drain your lifeforce. You think in the morning I will just play it for a bit and all the sudden the sun is rising again.
And then the DLC's will come. After playing those you are an old tard of 60 single and fat because  your wife left you. So don't buy it unless you want to end like this."
6846,Traffic management simulator

6848,This is absolutely next level of Simcity. Pack up your city and move here
6849,love this game. Would recommend it!!

6855,"Its fun and interresting.

6856,"The ability to make and control a city to how you want it to be, play it as unlimited money and get it all the way it should have been from the start, or build it like an actual city where you have to balance incomes against expenses and build a thing that will work and upgrade it again when time and money permits.

6857,"Very relaxing game. Just vibe out and make a city. Only downside is that there is a mountain of DLC and if you want it all, it's gonna cost you. I don't have any DLCs. Don't even know where to start. Base game fills my needs just fine though."
6858,"best game ever
impossible to hate
as you begin your ``quick half an hour chill`` four hour later you find yourself with million downloaded mods obsessing over smallest details

6866,"its a good game, but far better with mods and assets"
6867,"good game

6871,Better Than Sim City.

6891,This is one of the best sandbox city building games you can play. You can practically build you city in any way you want which is one of my favorite aspects about this game. It is also great that in the steam workshop you can download mods to help enhance the game. My one major complaint about this game though is its over reliance on dlc which is kinda annoying but this makes the game only $20 bucks. Besides this a I would highly recommend this game if you want to create a functioning city.
6892,good game
6893,"I enjoyed the game when I last played it. Decent city builder. Wanted to get back into it again and... 

Which of the 38 DLC is actual DLC and which is just an mtx listed as dlc? 
My brain hurts looking at the store... I gave up trying to figure out what it is that wanted to buy and on playing the game"
6894,YES
6895,Really really funny game <3
6896,YWES
6897,"It says ""Please describe what you like about this product"" What's there to like? You build a city... For real though, it's beautiful"
6898,"“Cities: Skylines is  so addictive it will eat up hours of your time, and  the developers have promised to continue support for the title in the future, and if you do want to change it up there are a huge amount of mods and assets  for the game. All this means you can play it over and over again and never get bored. 9.5/10"
6899,Had to buy a second keyboard to use all the hotkeys
6900,Amazing game. It can work on PC's with a lower specification than stated. I have spend hours on this game. I would highly reccomend it!
6901,pogr geim
6902,"I really like how the Steam Workshop of Cities Skylines works so well.
I was able to find almost everything that I wanted to make an more realistic city and that's amazing."
6903,Hard to learn but once you have it down it becomes a very good city sim.
6904,"just made a giant volcano is shit erupt. 11/10 game
"
6905,yes yes yes!!!
6906,Good game! Wait for CS:L 2!
6907,"Enjoyed playing this, with the variation of mods that helps things get interesting or more accurate."
6908,gut
6909,very fun and great gamplay
6910,freaking love it
6911,i like it...
6912,This game is fun for recreating real life cities. It's quite fun but hard to progress through but it gets fun once you get the hang of it.
6913,"When you got the idea and built it, it can get beautiful"
6914,"This game i really good, I really love strategy games that support your creativity, my rating is 8.5/10"
6915,infinte posibilites
6916,Old Simcity player here. Familiar and yet so many new stuff!
6917,"Do you like to organize stuff, or not or maybe just enjoy watching digital people use a crosswalk the wrong way well have we got a game for you. But really if you like city building games this pretty much has all the good bits and very few of the bad."
6918,very good game to play when trying to waist time or when you have nothing better to do or if you are looking for a game that uses creativity
6919,"I like how the game has realistic need for water pipes and electricity. I dislike how you need sooo many schools and hospitals so close together to satisfy the education rates because in real life, you dont have schools a block down from eachother.. same for hospitals. Their radius needs to be increased by ALOT"
6920,"I've played this game for a combined total of 5.6 days and I really like it. But please explain to me why all the DLCs total up to $250? Don't you guys already make enough from the $30 to purchase the game? This wouldn't be much of a problem but the Vanilla version has so much restrictions and limits to your city. For the important DLCs that I can't stand not having total up to $100+$30 for the game. Too really enjoy the game and expand your creativity you need to spend more than a weeks paycheck on minimum wage which is stupid considering in America alone 76% of kids play video games who usually don't even have an income. It would be a lot easier if you guys would make them free or cut down the prices to like $5. This shouldn't be too much of a problem since Paradox and Tantalus are worth a combined 3,146,800,000 and Colossal Order probably being in the 7 to 8 digit range. Not to mention Cities Skylines already made $4,000,000+ in revenue so far. So for this one factor I would not advise buying this game because once you do you will want to buy all the DLCs and end up wasting your money like me. (All though if you have $250 that you have no purpose for it is an amazing purchase) I forgot mention that I found the game on Xbox Game Pass and spent money on the packs but then figured out PC is 10x better so now have to buy the packs all over again. :|"
6921,its just like the old sim city but looks great. with other well placed changes!
6922,"An absolute nightmare. I loved watching people play this game so I decided to try for myself, big mistake. The UI makes it nearly impossible to use on a track pad, there is next to no explanation for anything in the game and the tips couldn't be less helpful if they tried. Nothing is explained and there's no way to figure out what anything means without spending at least 5 minutes researching either in game or online. I had fun for a second but not enough to be able to pretend I'm having a good time. I am completely disappointed in my purchase and wish I never bought this game. It's impossible for new players or people just getting into gaming to maneuver around the impossible controls and mechanics. You would think a tutorial would help but everything explained in game is useless and completely takes away from the gameplay"
6923,I love it
6924,Love this game and the details involved!
6925,Steam workshop is your friend... Definitely one of the best city builders
6926,"Fun game,  great for creative people."
6927,I killed all my people by feeding them sewage water
6928,is fun and a lot of content you can buy
6929,yes
6930,"Much Traffic, very build.

Overall 100/100 natural habitats destroyed, would reccoment"
6931,"Vanilla makes it unplayable for me. The colors are ugly, it's foggy, night time makes it impossible to se what I'm doing. With mods.. Sometimes it works, sometimes it won't. Now I just ragequit because I couldn't place underground metro from one stop to another, BOTH underground (slope was too steep how matter WHERE I places it), sp I put anarchy on and then it just deletet all the ground. I deleted the track, tried again and same. Only this time I could not delete the track again NO MATTER WHAT I DID! Before I played a lot, but the updates made the game ugly and dark, mods doesnæt allways work. I've played a lot before, really liked this, but now I don't. I tried again to day, but the game is still rubbish. And now I don't want to play anymore. It's no fun, one mistakes and I have to use a lot of time deleting track or road and try again, and then money runs out so I'm stuck with a junction so cars can't enter, so I don't make money and game over. I'm through, rubbish game. This is a good example of a game that DOES NOT get better with updates. And I've played for over 90 hours, I've been here a log time. But now.. I give up."
6932,cool
6933,...
6934,roads go brrr....
6935,"Great game if you're willing to pay around 100$, dull and boring if you decide to just buy the game without any DLC. 

Cities skylines is an amazing city builder game, honestly the best one you can buy at the moment. The game itself is pretty well polished with design, game-play and user interface but the only issue I have with the game is the lack of content. The game by itself without any DLC gets very dull and repetitive quickly and although I'm sure that with all the DLC purchased that the game would have enough content to have good replay value but all the DLC is just simply overpriced. DLC either adds very little additional content or is simply ridiculously priced costing a third of the games price for something that should honestly cost 5$."
6936,Hands down the best current city builder sim. I highly recommend looking at the mods for this game as well as they improve the experience even more and the community is very active.
6937,"Lovely city building sandbox; really does need quality of life mods enabled. As someone who played SimCity as a kid, this is certainly a step in the right direction. 7/10 without mods, 8.5/10 with mods."
6938,Cities go brrrrr
6939,Fun and well made game. Only missing is multiplayer option to play with friends somehow; maybe owning an indipendent city on the side
6940,"I've had it for few months, it's worked 4 times constantly crashes and don's recommend it"
6941,Great game!
6942,"Pretty much the only way to play this game is with mods. It seems like I always get a decent city going, then an update comes out and everything breaks."
6943,Great Game
6944,"Been playing this game off and on for years. The first third of my play time was vanilla without mods and DLC; just the base game itself is great. The second third I finally got some quality life DLCs, they add great assets that IMO should be included into the base game at this point. The final third of play time I have added mods and the game is at its best for me. 

My main complaint and it seems to be a popular complaint is the vehicles don't use the lanes properly. So be prepared to get frustrated with that. (hence the need for some mods). This game also is very trial by fire and has a need to rely on the community to help get past learning curves. 

For anyone who loves building simulators, this should be a must in your game library."
6945,I have 634 hours in this game. What else do you think I should say? 😂
6946,Just a great game :)))
6947,i flood my city
6948,would recommend
6949,great sim game for cities.  right up my alley.  i would recommend some of the other packs with it to make QOL improvements.  youtube vids are great if you are a bit lost.
6950,"My city is the best city. 
I'm definitely not bankcrupt...

10/10 video game"
6951,amazing
6952,"This game can make you challenge yourself, who knows how cities and roads really work in real life?? not me, so it's fun to try and make it realistic and learning in the game to make traffic flow and generally managing a city can have its ups and downs but 10/10 fun. It's fun to watch all the people use the public transport too."
6953,"Save broke, completely unrecoverable."
6954,haha i made a poop ocean
6955,My pc can surprisingly run this very smoothly for some damn reason. Buy this shit n o w
6956,yes
6957,is an nice game once you turn on inf cash
6958,"Cities skylines: Traffic simulator/Abandoned building deletion simulator/""I looked away for 3 seconds why are there so  many dead people???"" simulator"
6959,My citizens are proud to live in the towns I name.
6960,great game
6961,"Please read this before you buy this game.

I loved playing this game on my Xbox. The DCLs were expensive but they made the game so much more fun. I put in almost 200 hours on my Xbox. I just got a PC so I thought I would download this game on PC because I heard it was better, but when I loaded up the game it asked me to link my Paradox Account so I thought that I would be able to keep all my DLCs and progress. I was severely mistaken because it wants me to re-buy all the DLCs and all my progress was gone. 

So if you are coming from Xbox or PlayStation expecting to keep all your progress and DLCs, don't."
6962,Great way to distract my mind from medical school stress!!
6963,Best city builder ever!
6964,"This game is annoying. Its ruined right off the bat when they have you start your city from a damn highway but dont let you build offramps for it. WTF is wrong with you developers? I played through already, let me build what I goddamn want!"
6965,
6966,"This was almost a really fun game. It feels like a city building sim, at first, but it isn't. It's a traffic sim, with virtually no intuitive tools. The UI is awful, and I found myself doing more reading on how to do things than actually doing them. It got dull really, really fast."
6967,"This game has such a strong grip on my life that I often find myself unable to step away from playing for hours on end. I've spent many Saturdays crafting the perfect metro system, or solving my city's traffic problems, and I wouldn't trade those Saturdays for the world. I grew up playing Sim City, and Sim City 3000, and this game is a masterful combination of the best parts of every Sim City game from days past. I look forward to the day when I can show my kids the cities their father built with the help of his college friends, and begin the next generation of city builders. 

This game will forever be one of my all-time favorites. I love you Cities Skylines."
6968,Awesome!!
6969,"If your dream career is being the City Architect then give this game a go. It gives you free range to recreate beautiful city ideals, create and name your own city or destroy it in a tsunami and meteor shower when you go bankrupt. It's all up to you."
6970,"immersive, engrossing resource management and beautiful to look at while it runs at high speed"
6971,"one of those game where you have to much power over everyone that you ruin an entire city by the press of a button 

10/10 would buy again"
6972,"Really fun...
... with mods and DLC..."
6973,Best City builder game out there.
6974,"I once played it for 10 hour straight and it felt like 30 minutes. nice game 9/10

6976,Seriously? $250 for DLC for a seven year old game? What a joke
6977,"This is the best city builder there is, thanks for fixing the game."
6978,Build Cities is good
6979,very fun thb
6980,idk
6981,"I don't like this game for 2 reasons:
Reason 1: Money runs out too quick and the houses won't stop complaining about having no water/electricity even if the pipe/powerline connects to it.
Reason 2: Mods don't seem to work."
6982,Fun Game that I can always come back to playing.
6983,this game is amog os
6984,"Addicting to build and maintain your city, and so many ways to customize and make unique!"
6985,just fun
6986,"I really like this game at the sale price, it is really fun, the dlc's really increase the price quickly tho,"
6987,"great city manager. It needs some mods to be perfect but this is the best hands on city manager regardless. They don't make you waste time reading a bunch of text boxes, its very interactive and you can start a game quick without knowing anything. That in itself sets itself above the rest."
6988,A city planning career or a video game? Hard to tell. Wonderful game and very easy to heavily mod.
6989,"As a city painter, it is not very intuitive and very cumbersome to play. The road tools are limited to straight, curve and freeflow mode, with no copy, paste options. There are two options for density with three types of zoning of houses, shops and factories, however no master control to control appearance and even the high density is too small in size. The agent system of the population is very prone to traffic congestion. You are reliant on mods for any decent appearance change. The mods are great, but its like relying on charity work for the basic stuff; mod should add stuff, not fix problems the developers have created.

As a city management, it is too bare bones and lacks any real depth, Your newer buildings are just a larger radius with a new larger agent refilling a service quota of each building. The game at its base lacks most basic features of a city builder and unless you go by specific layouts, the cities won't be efficient and self sufficient.

The DLCs are barely worth the pricetag and most of them are copy paste of different things with the same internal logistics; Campus and Industry are same house units in a block that take money, that go to a different block to convert and give money while all of this unlocks new blocks and levels up a central block. Park life and Green Cities could had been merged. Mass transit barely expands the haphazardly created transportation systems while after dark and sunset harbour tries to add some depth but instead adds random assortment of content because it failed to give the game any meaningful complexity. And the snow one is pointless since you are locked to a separate save file for the snow.

This game would had been 6/10 if there wasn't a shortage of city builders after SimCity was butchered by EA.
Considering average game is 7/10 these days, not recommended."

6996,Very good game. A lot of options for developing and managing your city.
6997,"Best builder game I've ever played, and that includes Anno 1800 ;D"
6998,"I like this game at first but I realized this game has left so many important decision on building a city, without mod this game is nothing, this game don't have religious building it/s like everybody is atheist and that's discrimination, well I hope I get my refund."
6999,build a city
7000,"everyone keeps dying, good game still"
7001,i would recomend this game if you like to build your own city and find out how you can make the best city possible
7002,"Great game with everything you need to spend hours building a city.
"
7003,it good
7004,seruuu
7005,it's relaxing
7006,"The ultimate city builder, lots to learn but there is a wealth of very helpful You

7007,ok
7008,i built a city and nuked them when they started complaining

7011,i love lean
7012,Switching to Cities was difficult at first but totally worth it. It has all the detailed micro managing and infrastructure that they got rid of in Simcity (2014).
7013,Best Game ever
7014,So relistic!
7015,"Nice game, nice community."
7016,"It's pretty fun, even without DLC. Bringing mods into the mix is really fun. I enjoy getting to the point where I can make dams, then damming off an area and making a city within the area."
7017,"It was incredible confusing and the graphics were so low, it looked really blurry and i twas hard to read the tiny words. Would not recommend."
7018,good game
7019,good game still learning the game mechanics
7020,"Fun
"
7021,"The game is good...
But I cannot recommend it when the base game is stripped down and sold to users in bits through DLC at a ridicilous cost.
Even excluding the cosmetic/non-gameplay DLC the total cost is around 200 euros for all the features.
Unfortunately this is what paradox does with all their games.
Stellaris, HoI are all in a similar state."
7022,it good
7023,"Best city building game ever, very little bugs, amazing game
11/10 literally one of the best designed games ever
warning tho : is very hard to run, if ur game runs bad id reccomend getting more ram"
7024,IT GOOD
7025,An essential game for who love city simulators!
7026,"Cities Skylines my all-time favourite game – as you can see by the playtime.
But it is a love-hate relationship:
Pro:
1. Beautiful towns can be created, the complexity of all kinds of transport have to be included and utilised, it is just fun watching your little people walking the roads.
2. Steam offers a brilliant workshop with amazing mods and assets by this game’s community, a never-ending joy of daily scanning the workshop for more fantastic stuff.
3. Building a town and country site is such a lovely contrast to all the shooter and destruction games out there.

Contra:
1. The game’s engine leads every developing town running against a performance wall. The developers did not even bother implementing any optimisation, while such has been provided by the community.
2. The game becomes truly playable only with community mods such as e.g. traffic management, placement support, tree rotations and ground cover paintings. Looking back, all such appears to be basics and should have been in the original game in the first place.
3. The developers provided lots of DLCs, which costs mostly a third or close to a half of the base game. Some of these DLCs are obviously designed for target groups – e.g. University – or offer content that should have been already in the base game and had meanwhile been provided by the community anyway – e.g. Airport. So instead of Engine optimisation to ensure longer lasting builds and fun to play, the developer's focus had been on additional cash creation. Maybe some cash could have been created WITH engine optimisations?"
7027,House
7028,.
7029,Needed a break from Elite.....Love games that force me to think and plan rather than phew-phew endlessly to level up..
7030,no

7032,"The best city-building game
I've played a lot of games of this type, this one wins."
7033,poggers
7034,"It's a hard game when you first start, but later on you begin to understand it a little more. And then you still suck at it, because when you're first making your town, there's ALWAYS one thing you forget. Like connecting electricity to the water pumps. Or maybe I'm just dumb..."
7035,this game is fun but so unoptimized on linux
7036,An absolute time machine of a game
7037,Is gud.
7038,No multi-screen support...basic stuff guys.
7039,Great and fun game once you get a hang of how everything works in it. The tutorial doesn't get much but after an hour you'll be like a pro. Overall i'd rate it 4.2/5 stars.
7040,"An extremely relaxing city sim with lots of options and potential for creativity. You can lose countless hours of distraction to this game, which in these days isn't a bad thing at all."
7041,amazing game. I love it
7042,This is good game
7043,"good game, spent 3 hours on it, not much to say."
7044,"I love this game, I'm still new and learning but the game is just perfect
"
7045,super fun and relaxing
7046,GOAT city simulation game!
7047,The best city builder in the world
7048,If you like modern city building then this is the game for you.
7049,"The best city builder out there, slightly overwhelming with the amount of DLC available however, which could be a pro or con."
7050,Good.
7051,"I love this game. It's a bit challenging at first with the money situation, but once you figure out how to do stuff, it's a lot of fun!"
7052,so fun
7053,I would highly recommend this game to people who like building and simulation.
7054,If you liked SiMCity this is right up your alley
7055,Yes.
7056,yes
7057,o
7058,air ports is great whole game exellent i reccomend buy airports
7059,"first its a city simulator, later it becomes a traffic management simulator"
7060,"Crashing issues lost my city progress. I've been working on this city for 4 hours straight and when I pressed save it crashes, completely wasted 4 hours of my life
"
7061,"Although this game is overly infatuated with automobiles and  American (sprawling) styles of development, it's still the best of its kind. Hopefully future entries in the series will have a better array of tools for creating cities."
7062,A better Sim City in almost every way imaginable. 3/30/2022
7063,"It could really do with a new release on a modern engine to take advantage of better hardware, but the potential of this game (especially with mods) is limitless. I feel like I'd benefit from a degree in fluid dynamics and civil engineering when it comes to planning out road networks."
7064,Best city builder to date
7065,GREAT IF YOUR INTO ARCHITECTURE AND URBAN PLANNING. OR IN THOSE PROFESSION LIKE MY SELF LOL
7066,good game
7067,game doesn't run
7068,very nice game with the dlc you have hours and hours of develp your city a gem in the comunity
7069,"Been fighting forever to get this game to run in a custom resolution in windowed mode, but nothing works.
"
7070,That game is perfect for relaxing and unleashing your creativity. I would recommand it without a doubt.
7071,"it sucked my dick. I'm a fan
"
7072,You build a city and its cool.
7073,"Great City builder, for $30 could be a bit much for people, Paradox games go on sale a lot so you can just wait for it to be on sale. Lots of content in the base game even without DLC, DLC add lots of content (wait for sale for DLC), however there are tons of things on the Workshop for this game that make it so much better; Move It! Traffic Manager, etc, and tons of buildings."
7074,"So much fun for someone who loves to plan and organize ANYTHING! Can be a little laggy depending on your setup, but even with that, still 5/5 stars!"
7075,Built a town. got in debt. took out more loans. had more debt. dumped pollution everywhere. industrialized. developed tech. reduced pollution. won.
7076,pp
7077,This game is Oxycodone for people who have ADHD.
7078,"The best city builder game ever.

A hint to not just new players: Don't take the game as ""I have a huge income, I beat the game"", instead focus on the city itself, on its development, realism, tourism, nature, parks, etc. Just try to be a MAYOR with the most advanced city around.

DLCs are definitely worth it. Well I mean not those RADIO DLCs, but the ones with real content (Distaster, Campus, Parklife, etc.).

Don't go for all mods in the beginning. Try vanilla game, try DLCs, try mods once you understand what you are missing in the game."
7079,"This game is over the top addictive. I always looked for that Sim City vibe after SC95 and this is incredible in so many ways. Gorgeous, fun to build up, and fair."
7080,You can play this game without mods but not dlcs
7081,this game is so crush good
7082,100%
7083,"Good game... too bad the insane number of DLC you need to make it worth your time, you don't need to buy them all of course, but there are some that you must have if you want to actually enjoy this game... if you like city management titles you'll know which ones."
7084,its a great experience and it will give you a creative outlet at an affordable cost.
7085,cant wait for the human rights dlc
7086,(build) city
7087,I enjoy spending several hours building cities just to level them back to the ground.  Rinse and repeat.  This game is pretty great for that.
7088,Only way this game could be better is if they had social classes or businesses in cities which could grow and fall etc. amazing game.
7089,i loove it
7090,nice g4me
7091,greatest game ever
7092,Great city building simulator. Even better with steam workshop mods
7093,"Very nice and relax game . No complaints B.U.T. it would be nice to have the ''nodes'' mod tool as part of the game insted of needing to add a Mod (( not a real problem , you can find the mod in the workbench ))"
7094," At first I was impressed and also quite scared of how many options I had to do with my first city. I didn't know anything! I have to say - it takes time, A LOOT of it to understanding just the surface of the game. I recommend watching YouTube like Biffa or even the Cities Skylines channel itself.
 Also just to add, don't be scared and give a look into game's workshop. Many people gave their time and hard work so appreciate it and give it a go. There are many mods that help you with your first city, it's planning and infrastructure."
7095,It gud
7096,Excellent game with many useless DLCs! Many of them are also very useful and recommended...
7097,Its a sandbox game so that means its not for everybody but I like it you can build your own city and if you want something new to it you can buy some bundles and download some mods to it. When you do both It is just perfect. I would like to say dont buy this game on epic games you cannot download mods. I would recommend this for people who like sandbox games. Anyways have a good day.
7098,my town is better than malaysia's
7099,please help my family is taken hostage this isnt a joke please they are forcing me to play this shitty game i cant take this anymore please someone senfd help i want tosee the sun again please for the love of god i want to see the sun and breathe fresh air again
7100,"A good way to simulate the wants and needs of city folk, with space for creativity in many aspects.

It's a bit car centric for a game that rewards organising around public transport, but this feature tends to make you better at planning ahead. Also, it has pushed me to spend more time contemplating the real life city that I live in, which I'd argue is the mark of a good piece of media.

Potentially endless replayability and reflection. 8/10"

7129,"This game is really fun and I really enjoy playing it - the creative aspect of the game is seemingly endless making this game never boring. Although it would enhance the gameplay, you do not need a high-end PC to play this game either.
"
7130,"Really demanding game, requiring you to pay attention and calculate your every single move.

Loads of mods that are available make it even better.

It's definitelly rewarding if you give it much enough of your heart."
7131,Fun
7132,Best city builder out there. Can become very realistic and super customizable!
7133,idk i never played this
7134,Have over 175 Hours on this game. It can be easily modded and is strangely addictive. I could play it all day.
7135,I like
7136,Excellent games hidden behind far too many tiny overpriced DLC's. Devs should release these for free updates or at least bundle them into an affordable price.
7137,"pretty good game when paired with mods and dlcs

the moment you begin your city, you end up spending so much of your damn time on that city, and its pretty fun

so yea get the game, especially when the game and its dlcs are on sale"

7140,"This game beats the socks off the old city builder games, but I have to say I don't like it. I wish I did, but it is far too frustrating. I couldn't find a tutorial to demonstrate game principles. I built over the top of high quality resource locations because I wasn't high enough level to know where the resources were. During the process of restarting 3 times to get it right, I found myself even more frustrated with the stupid info thing at the top. 

It feels like being part of a group text you don't want to be in as it gives you information that may or may not be helpful. 

I have played an alpha city builder game that has better feel and more intuitive processes than this."

7151,"The greatest if not the best city-building game to date. So realistic that you won't understand how to properly start a city at first. Once you learn more, good luck to build your dream city!

I play this game vanilla only right now, but definitely will buy some DLCs in the future."

7155,Good game
7156,Excellent game!  Multiplayer works very well also.
7157,fun city builder where you just build city's and its super fun graphics are great gameplay is great sometimes when i start playing it i can't find myself stopping which is good and bad but mostly good so i for sure recommend it

Oh well, it's not everyday that you can hear a podcast and playing this while the neighbor next door thought I was screaming and raging about the over-lacking of infrastructures of traffic and public transport in our city. Turns out it was my city :'"
7164,Best city builder since OG Sim City!

7176,"city good. make money, lose money, repeat"
7177,"Great game (310+ hrs) BUT if you are starting out disable/do-not-download DLC.  Just make a city.  Play with it.  When you think you got it all worked out, add a (one) DLC.  Learn it, repeat.  If you throw everything in there all at once the game become an annoyingly complicated mess that never shuts TFU about ""check out this new building"" all time.  Its an awesome game but learn the base game first and take the DLC one at a time."
7178,This game is perfect for people who love cities and building! i would also reccomend the mass transit and green cites dlc!

7192,i love this game
7193,"Cities: Skylines scratch that itch for a good SimCity game, but the main gameplay loop is lost somewhere. It is fun to build the city, and wonderful to have such freedom when designing roads, but I can't shake the feeling that something is missing. Sure, you have short-term objectives since, as you reach some pop cap you gain new things to do, but the game feels like a time sink in both good and bad ways.

Played the main, basic, default, vanilla game, no mods or DLC. It is worth it the price if acquired in some sale, and is addicting to some players, but may bore players that came from other type of city sims like Anno or Ceasar."
7194,"My girlfriend likes to play this game without a shirt, so I see boobies.

I recommend"
7195,boring wihtout mods
7196,"In my 40 plus years of the gaming arena, I have never imagined a game of this level and complexity, as well as the support teams have come together to create an excellent game of un-ending experience and pleasure."
7197,yes
7198,I like that game. U can buy DLC 1 buy 1.
7199,good
7200,The learning curve for Cities:Skylines might be steep but that just means that you won't get bored with it in a week or two.  I am still a noob but I find the whole game intriguing and compelling.  I am a 'refugee' from an other city building simulation game so I do have a modest leg up in that regard.  There are plenty of YT videos out there so you can see the game for yourself.
7201,Awesome game made even better by the modding community. This is one of those games where I go through phases when I can't stop playing it. Been coming back to play this game again and again for years and I can't recommend it enough for anyone interested in the city building genre.
7202,"I spent 11 hours on this game so far. I got it yesterday. I didn't even realise. So yeah... Definitely recommend it - especially if you've got time to spare. My entire map flooded multiple times ad destroyed everything so gotta have patience, too."
7203,"Love this game, you can sit for hours just placing roads, blimps, trains, monorails, metros.... and then I got airports..... then green life... then industries... there is so much to nit pick over for detail!  you want a lamp on that one spot next to that park? GOT IT! Lamp post placed!"
7204,"This game is absolutely fun city building simulator. You should buy it if you like building cities or wants to make an ideal city. There are tons of community mods which makes the experience somewhat unique and a diverse choice. 
DLCs that are Must buy are:
-After Dark
-Mass Transit

"
7205,nice building simulator
7206,"Amazing game! Just like I expected it to be, is totally worth the prize, entertaining, fun and smart."
7207,"Love this game, but since I got the Airport DLC, it now crashes every time I try to start a new map.  I even reinstalled the game. This is a bummer since I now can't even play the other DLCs that were working just fine. Apparently there is a mod to fix this so call 'memory' issue.  If anything, just don't buy the Airport DLC.

Update, I think I got a refund for the Airport dlc.  So changed my recommendation."
7208,"Amazing. All there is to say really. Highly recommended, but the amount of positive reviews for this game are pretty obvious in how great it is."
7209,I like how it's really like real life because I've seen videos of real city planners playing it and the amount of detail is absolutely mind blowing it is a very nice game.
7210,yes good
7211,yes
7212,"Satisfying enough base game mechanics for something that came out in 2015. There are minor annoyances sometimes such as odd city service routing where a facility will send out a vehicle across the city to a location already with a nearby asset. But overall, I am enjoying my time with the game. I would recommend getting the game on sale at this point in time given that you'd eventually want to explore purchasing DLCs. 

10/10 class division simulator"
7213,Still need to find the time to get good at this
7214,Fun game when you have nothing else to do.
7215,Very fun but I hate the feeling of missing out on features because they are behind a pay wall.  I stopped playing this 7 years in protest again the DLC.  I refuse to play even though I think about it all the time...
7216,Lovin' it !
7217,"Amazing game. Would recommend to anyone who enjoys city-builders. With some mods, you are able to make everything in your city how you like it
"
7218,"Really fun game, although i've got to learn how to create more diverse cities because they all seem to look the same ;D"
7219,Great game and I love it.
7220,good graphic and good game mod like unlimted money.
7221,there could be more in the base game and not so many dlcs

7240,ok
7241,Fun and addictive.
7242,"Best city game on the market

7250,Visually stunning and a really fun game to play!
7251,"Its the best city builder game out there. It has all the features you would want plus more, would really recommend"
7252,"If you want to spend a crapload on dlc, I guess this game gets better but as it stands now, alone without any dlc, it\s worthless. Paradox Interactive cuts up their games into small chunks to sell it back to the customer piece by piece. The greed on display is sickening but that's the name of the game in the gaming industry these days."
7253,yes\
7254,Amazing way to spend your downtime if you are just wanting to relax and chill out. 10/10 recommend for someone who likes the little details in things and is a perfectionist.
7255,"If you want to kill time , is the best mode possible."
7256,"ахуен0

7257,"Easy to start playing with this game, but difficult to abandon. Cool to experiment how to manage an entire city or cities."
7258,"Great game, 4 out of 5

Only reason of 4 is the traffic.  I have seen games like Infra space, and the intersection/traffic management is way better.  6 lane roads become 1 lane of traffic

Other than that, it's awesome!"
7259,"calming game
"
7260,"I love this game. This game was suggested to me and I decided to try it without knowing anything. The game can guide you when you need it, and there is a ton of content extra from mods and DLC when you've mastered the basics. 

It reminds me of playing Tycoon games for hours on end when I was a kid."
7261,games hard but i like it but i will get better
7262,p good
7263,GAME IS GOOD GAME IS GREAT. ok all seriousness i would recommend this game pretty fun to make a city and the modding comunity is great
7264,"Ive had this game for a while, every time i play i end up wanting to yell cause of how annoying i find this game. tried many times yet have never made a city to last 15 minutes. i always end up spending everything on plumbing and electricity and have no money left for roads or anything else"
7265,Good game.
7266,The game crashed after 2 hours of building a city. You can easily get carried away with it. But once it crashed I thought that I could just load the autosave that I had set up for every minute. No. It doesn't save anything. All my progress was lost. It doesn't back up to steam by default. It doesn't back up to the mandatory new account that you made just after installing. You have to read and agree to 5 different TOUs and EULAs before you get the chance to load the game. Maybe I'm just unlucky but after looking this problem up online I see that it's been the case for 4 years already. You can just get unlucky and your game might crash and you lose your autosave AND any manual saves you've done on the city. The standard practice appears to be to rotate 3 manual saves periodically to avoid this problem. The developer should stop pumping out new DLCs to milk money and focus on the core game.
7267,really fun
7268,All roads lead to gridlock.
7269,The game is worth every penny. it deserves all the fame

7276,"Best creative game I have ever encountered. If you like building cities, airports or structures, this is the game for you, there are infinite possibilities with downloadable mods in case you don't like vanilla or want to explore something new. I will never regret paying for the game and ALL of its DLCs."
7277,Simple and easy to get into!
7278,"This game is pretty good, sad to see the dlc is to expensive tho"
7279,It's all about the traffic
7280,obsessed with this game it is so addictive. in all a great game

7284,It's a fun game
7285,"gud gam (:
"
7286,still the best city builder
7287,"its good
"
7288,"I actually have been playing this game since idk probably 2015? And was overwhelmed by the massive lag it has because of my old computer after that I uninstalled. Then I started playing again on 2018 after i got my new Laptop. Soon after that, got bored and left the game again. And finally on 2022 I came back, loved the game ever since. Back then I was using crack to play because I don't have money, I don't want to buy games. Now that I am in University able to have my own income I can buy anything I want, including this game. 

I have been planning to create airports like gigantic Airports since the first release of this game. But there was no any, and finally with the new DLC comes out it motivates me to create beautiful looking city. This game keeps improving overtime even though it has been 7 years of age. Supported by the modding community and the general community. 

Honestly Cities Skylines has one of the best communities I have ever interacted with. It's different from other games. In here 90% chance of someone that you met in the community it's either a Genius or VERY Genius. The knowledge and theory that they have is not just Game Theory. It's basically applied in the real world. Like for example, of how buildings cannot be put directly in a shore because of low soil, and how an airstrip could impact the planes, and you can't put high/skyscraper buildings within radius of 20km close to Airport. In reality those theories doesn't apply in the game because the game just follow according to the programming. But if you prefer on realism you can do so.

Really reccomended game!"

7316,a game where you can ruin families with a single tornado very fun and cool
7317,"9/10

Why?

1. I played the original sims city 4 on disk as a child and this reminded me of it but as a more intuitive and less punishing version. This takes what already exists on these types of city building games and does it better tenfold.

2. Great support with new DLCs and community content, good integration of this.

3. A sandbox style game when you reach a certain threshold around 7K population and its pretty easy from then on. Its hard to lose money from that point.

4. Things I don't like: traffic- the cims seem to bunch up in 1 lane more often than not which puts the traffic to a standstill and slowly drains your money since nobody can get anywhere, public transport doesn't seem to alleviate this. Deathwaves - city is fine until like 50K people then there are those stupid deathwaves which wipes out 5-10K people causing disruptions to services and eventual drain of money.

Overall, one of the best city building games ever."

I came back to this within a day, and I am now greatly enjoying it.  The random buildings popping up within zone gives this game its own sense of life.I'm still learning, and have been fulfilled sense giving it another shot. I look forward to many years of game-play here, if i am so fortunate."

7336,"build city, send tsunami, repeat"
7337,Great City Builder game for newbs and vets.
7338,Fun and relaxing.
7339,It is what the newest Sim City dreamed it would be. This is what you want.
7340,probably one on the best and most fun stimulation games out there. i love this game and all the stuff you can do in it. would 100% recommend. this game is a whole lot better with the steam workshop aswell
7341,1
7342,yes
7343,ok
7344,"Don't buy it because your life will be destroyed, your wife/gf will abandon you, your kids will starve and your dog/cat will shit all over the house."
7345,I've spent over 1100 hours in this game and would recommend it to anyone who loves a good city building game. It's a great traffic simulator as well. My most recent DLC purchase was Parklife and I love it.
7346,Very fun and consuming. Good if you want a game to truly sink into for long periods of time. Very addictive.
7347,"Build anything with unlimited design, & a gigantic community workshop with just about every add-on you would ever need. It's the game i have always returned back too as it never gets old."
7348,Yes.
7349,"Absolutely love this game. I find the traffic management actually very relaxing. Sure wish a newer version of this would be out soon but with the amount of mods and DLC for this, there is years of play left in this game."
7350,Very good
7351,I have this game for the switch and I just loved it so much i had to buy the PC version  and now i definitely hooked. I can't stop playing it but I just wish they give out some more free DLCs that would be nice.
7352,Is good
7353,its a super fun game to mess around with :D
7354,siiu
7355,chill game
7356,literally changed my entire life
7357,"just fun all around
DLC is expensive for more liking but it still adds quality to the game"
7358,A perfect game for showing your creative city building skills!
7359,traffic 1%
7360,Its a fun gamer to kill some time
7361,"Really great city building, shame the DLC is extortionate. Would love to experience the rest of the game but can't justify spending £100 for the rest of the game."
7362,"pretty good game, worth the price and the mods add more if you want to decorate your experience

10/10"
7363,Best city builder out there to date!
7364,I love intentionally making the worst city ever imagined.
7365,The sky is the limit... except its bloody hard to reach the sky. Until then there is my mediocre towns. Good fun!
7366,es bueno :)
7367,ol
7368,I don't have issues.
7369,my brother in christ you made the car dependent infrastructure.
7370,"Good game, but I cannot recommend because of the massive amount of DLC and price gouging. Just look at the list of DLC and it speaks for itself. Paying over $200 for a game is just absurd."
7371,"MUCHAA ESTRATEGIA CON ESTE JUEGO  SOLO LA PACIENSIA DOMINAR ESTE JUEGO
"
7372,"Its how I remember Sim City 4, but a little bit better. The way that movement is calculated is much more micro level, which is interesting and challenging, but more realistic. 
Glad I picked it up again."
7373,"very fun and addicting game!
"
7374,"this game is awesome, dont judge it off your first 50 hours of gameplay. it takes time to learn, good luck!"
7375,"just when you think you can't get any more autistic, this game kicks you in the head, spits on your face, and teaches you to never say never"
7376,The best city building you've ever met !
7377,"Great city builder. DLC adds a lot of neat features, but can play completely vanilla and enjoy. Modding community super active, there are lots of assets to customize your game while still allowing for achievements."
7378,This game is seriously addicting. Already bought a few DLCs and stay up at night wondering how I'm going to improve my city next.
7379,very good game
7380,you dont know what to play its a perfect timming game.
7381,amazing game
7382,"The over all experience of Cities: Skylines is pretty great. One of the best city-builders with mod support that adds so much to the game. The only place I'd say this game fails is the abundance of paid dlc. I understand some dlc for a game but when many of the dlc add in minimal things that should've been in the game originally or added for free via an update it's kind of outrageous. Besides the dlc, mods add a lot to the game especially once a player may have exhausted the base game or wants to enhance the base game which can improve the experience. Overall Cities: Skylines is very enjoyable and great for someone who enjoys a good city-builder sim."
7383,this game never gets old. with all the DLCs and different addons you can reinvent the game and how you play it.
7384,"Me and my Nan played this. she hated the game so much that she broke my only duel shock 4 1/2 controller. I had to leave the house and bulk buy them. They were all out of the Duel shock 4 1/2 so i had to settle for the Nintendo 64 controller, this was not a problem as this was the better model. this had me doing 123 no scopes in the first game!"
7385,daddy
7386,it is great game
7387,"If you like tycoon/building games, I highly recommend for you to try this game."
7388,"This is a very good game! Awesome for building big cities, even more with mods and assets!"
7389,"Need a relaxing sandbox game to work your creativity? Look no further, because Cities: Skylines is just SO MUCH FUN! 

I would recommend this game to anyone interested in planning, design, or simply anyone who enjoys creative problem solving. Cities: Skylines easily kept my attention for a couple weeks of heavy playing despite my ADHD and normal lack of patience for slower, non-competitive gameplay. 

My only complaint would be that once you unlock all buildings and infrastructure types, the game begins to become very repetitive. Personally, I do not think new maps/resources makes a large enough impact on gameplay to replay the base game. It would have been interesting if each map had monuments or industries that you can unlock specifically for that map (or group of maps). I feel like this would have added to the replay-ability of the game...

Obviously this is where DLCs come in, and don't forget workshop content! The community that supports this game have built incredible mods and in-game content to help you create and grow an unbelievable city! Be sure to check them out for your best experience."
7390,If you miss the good and old SimCity days. That's the game for you!
7391,j
7392,yes
7393,its a very fun game
7394,cool game takes about 7 hours to get used to
7395,A simple joy. :)
7396,very good
7397,My hours. Nice.
7398,relaxing game where you can act like a mayor god and do whatever you want to do.
7399,"even if the game is great, saying that it is compatible with linux is bullshit, trying to load any of my saves (no mods) crashes the game and the whole system.

anyway, when i play it on windows it works nice and it is super fun, I also understand why americans complain of the DLC's prices but in my country they are $1 U.S.

8/10"
7400,Highly recommend this game to anyone that wants a SimCity like game.  The Workshop and community is AWESOME.
7401,"I still haven't gotten all of the achievements in over 5000HRs , great game!"
7402,"Amazing game, real challenge to build your city so plan what your going to do in advance!"
7403,nice
7404,"yes
"
7405,"Old Game. imho it gets frustrating quick and you need to download third party software mods to bridge the gap.  
For a game with as many purchasable downloads as this game you would think they would improve the game over time with updates and release a new version after 5 years.
Unfortunately this is not the case. 
I would happily pay $50 for an updated version 2 of this game that improves upon the original but I can't fault anyone that wants to spend $30 or less on this game and see if you like it. 
I liked it. 
Then I downloaded mods to make it better.
Then I realized I am putting up with issues they should have fixed a long time ago.
Coming to a game years and years after the fact, for a game as loved by a community as this one is, you would think it would be a smooth experience, but it is not.  
It is also not a bad game.  
This is a difficult review because it has great bones and my frustration is that it isn't better and they don't have a better game to buy.  
So I stopped playing and I will wait till they launch a proper version 2. 
Other sim games will get my money here and there until they launch the version 2, because I think version 2 will be great, but this one just has too many issues the deeper you get involved in playing it.
You can either put up with all those issues like some do, or you can just be thankful for the time you spent for as long as you did.

I am grateful for the time I spent. 

Also, this game in many ways can become more of a traffic simulator than a city simulator, and that is a large part of the issue of them not updating the game over time, despite mods being able to help with that aspect of the game.

I am not knocking on the traffic mods, or the people that enjoy designing around traffic.  
I am saying that it should be easier to manipulate those things out of the box.  
You should have the better controls without the need for the mods. 
The traffic can be a fun part of the game but it shouldn't become such a mountain having to download mods that give you specific capabilities like easy on and off ramp configurations, or even just building straight roads and such.   Or the madness with needing a mod to make turning lanes so the AI of the cars makes the traffic flow better.
I also see in youtube content this refference to lane geometry or lane math, where you have to downgrade a 3 lane road to 2 lanes before an on ramp, so the on ramp is that ""third lane"" and everyone merges automatically.  
If you do this then your road likes like a hot mess cause the two lane section is narrower for a section of this main highway or road.  It should have a merging section.  It should go from 3 lanes to 3 lanes plus a merge section.  Then back down to 3 lanes after enough merge section.  The road should be temporarily WIDER, not more narrow. 
This is the type of absurdity you need to get to for traffic to not have bad AI jams, and yet 7 years after launch and this isn't fixed, nor is a new version 2 game with better traffic and road options on the market. 

Unfortunate."
7406,nice
7407,dat dlc price
7408,"The cost of the DLC's do add up but must admit, I have not had so much playing a game in a long time. I really enjoy the workshop and how many opportunities there are to be creative and admire other peoples creativity."
7409,_l_
7410,"The game is brilliant! I must say, the game totally exceeds expectations.

Pros:
1. The game doesn't give you random things like houses and shops in random places, YOU give them allocated spaces.
2. The game's graphics are really nice. I play on Medium settings with certain settings off. Yet, I get realistic graphics. So, you know how the graphics would be on maximum settings ;)
3. The game has very detailed stuff, like information views.
4. It's not like 'just provide the people water, they don't care about the pollution' - no. If your water current - yes, water current - rushes in the opposite direction and the water pumper ABSORBS sewage water, the people complain!

Yes, as they all do....
Graphics  - Really good
Game play - Amusing
Cost - Worth the price, better on sale however
Level - Easy to understand, hard to master
Realism (Physics) - Good

What I don't like - 
1. DLCs and price - Too many DLCs! Total cost goes way too high. I'd recommend that the developers reduce prices.

Overall rating - 9/10"
7411,Best part about this game is creating these absurd cities and flooding them!
7412,is good
7413,this game is still insane in the membrane
7414,"This game is a delightful way to spend several hours doing virtually nothing and not feel bored. It's enjoyable in a low-impact kind of way and is casual and relaxing which is exactly what I wanted. I mostly play it when I'm sick or in pain and just kind of want to do something but lack the brain power to boot up a more demanding game.

All in all? My only complaint is that it's not very intuitive. I had to do a fair amount of looking around online for information about how to accomplish certain things. But that's really the only complaint I have about it."
7415,Its ight
7416,its aright.
7417,
7418,just look at the dlc.
7419,h
7420,Can commit mass genocide. 10/10

7422,love this game so awesome to make your own cities and were goes were.love this simulation game
7423,"Great game, eats up a lot of time.  But does have some issue loading."
7424,"Well in 7 years they managed to totally break their own game.

Saves randomly delete. Errors pop up on screen constantly. Rendering has become an afterthought. Traffic still hasn't been fixed.

I used to reccomed this to anyone that even mentioned Sim City. But I won't be doing that anymore. I'll tell people to avoid it. Like I'll be doing.

It's past due for a sequel. Stop working on DLC that should have been in the base game and move on. Or just rewrite this whole game.

7 years of intermittent development has broken it."
7425,"i demolished birmingham, never been happier"
7426,"If you know, you know. It's a great game."
7427,"do not play without TMPE, unless you want to look at traffic jams caused by cars driving on 1 lane on a 6 lane road."
7428,very cool game!
7429,is gud brooooooooo!!!!!
7430,You can make shit lakes and force your people to drink it or drown in it.
7431,"verry good, yes"
7432,bikin kota dah
7433,Great game!
7434,"What should I say, its just the perfect city simulation!"
7435,"My addiction to city builders was realised in Cities: Skylines. ( *¯ ꒳¯*)

Even after 7 years, this game is still in the top most-played games in Steam and there's an active modding community as well. The developers host Community Challenges and recently a Global Build-Off to showcase players' creations and they regularly stream them on their YouTube channel which keeps everyone engaged and encouraged to share their designs.

I believe this is my very first city-building simulation.. and I remember I mostly spent my time and resources just designing and not actually paying attention to progression lol. Got myself too fixated on the idea of building that it came to a point where I'd always think about roads and draw a lot of plans on my math grid notebook whenever I'm at school or at home. Also at that time, it affected how I see the flow of traffic in my hometown. During commute or even when I'm in bed, I'd wonder a lot about how to make proper and efficient roads and bridges to regulate traffic better or how to build a very sustainable infrastructure. For real. I played this game outside of Steam so my real playtime is not here and I haven't played much when I got it. I super recommend this game. Get it."
7436,Fortnite
7437,Excelent Game.
7438,"The game is good but is broken...

The traffic (even with traffic manager mod - which helps a bit) is broken : vehicle routes are statically computed at start, without taking into account the existing traffic (it seems to just calculate the shortest path / lanes to use, that's it)
As a result, all vehicles use the same paths and lanes, resulting in stupid jams where 2 lanes roundabouts are using mainly a single lanes.
Moreover free and high speed roads are almost totally not used while others are totally overloaded.
And finally, on roundabouts, vehicle are stopping randomly even if there is the roundabout is free to enter...

This ends with fighting versus broken AI, trying to make it using obvious paths it do not use, instead of handling road traffic.

For a game where traffic management is one of the foundation, this is an epic fail.

"
7439,Game is great but for fucks sake stop milking me dry.
7440,"i suck at this game, my cities doesn,t look good at all. i know how to survive initially and get my cities economy in green, but it never look great . purchased almost all dlc so that i can make it good. after reaching 30k to 40k population i quit and start a new city , why you might ask ... the answer is Traffic flow....the choices you made earlier makes it tough to improve. what this game requires is patience . i do plan to return to my old cities later but for now i am creating another one with enough space between my roads so that i can later upgrade into highways, hopefully that will solve traffic issues . so many paid dlc is my only complain with this game, the modding community is excellent in this game and that's a big positive."
7441,its AWESOME
7442,i should become a city planner so i can make awful road plans in real life too
7443,is alright.
7444,Is een zeer rustgevende game
7445,Love it
7446,Good game
7447,"fun
"
7448,"Amazing, Addictive, Awesome"
7449,Game is fun and there is a lot of replayability as you can change goals and gameplay. Only thing I don’t like about it is that the base game is boring which pretty much forces you to use mods and buy dlc. With a game that’s been out as long as this one and has as many dlc as this one it is not possible for most people so you must pick and choose which ones you want to use. I delayed actually getting this game as the dlc was far too expensive and the base game was pretty barebones.
7450,It's a great game. period.
7451,very good very nice
7452,good
7453,it gud
7454,"Love this game
"
7455,good :)
7456,"I would definitely recommend this game to other people. I didn't know how to make cities at first, so it was a learning experience. You don't have to know how to build to get this game. Tons of mods, and assets to download with the game. All DLC's are amazing. 9/10. I took a point off because I wish there were different types of styles, and a medium density type of residential."
7457,Love this game and how they support modders
7458,how could you not reccommend
7459,"amazing af, and If i said its good that means its good, so play it or else"
7460,yes.
7461,a
7462,Great game for those who like to build their own worlds in which they can control every detail.
7463,"You can make your dream city in here, it is amazing."

7467,Game gud. Build road. Forget pipe. Suffer. gud game! Does bore brian after time but that be personal problems. Enjoying game. Good.
7468,i love bad bitchs thats my fucking problem
7469,"Great game to spend time and chill.
Great sandbox."
7470,"One of my top favorite games. It's the true successor to Sim City. I always have loads of fun building new cities, using mods, and even importing my hometown into the game. The only real grip is that some mechanics are locked behind DLC, but this game benefits from a wonderful modding community that can ease that. 9/10"
7471,Great game
7472,a good game good ctiy stuff
7473,Yuh
7474,I don't have the game but I can write a review somehow? I like this game but my account is restricted for no reason. So not today steam.

7479,"Step 1: Feed the sewage into the water supply
Step 2: Profit"
7480,good game
7481,"Great game 10/10. There are almost no bugs. It would be cool if there was a sports DLC where your city has a 
sports team which you can gain popularity and atraciton of it. Grapycs are good. All in all it's a great game. Would recomend."
7482,"It will make days and weeks dissapear. 
Super fun.

Uses ALOT of ram tho."
7483,"bless, play it, it's good, have fun"
7484,The game is for people who really want to build the city of their dreams. May it be while using a vanilla assets or by using mods. The simulation is great. Be warned though that traffic in this game is hard to solve.
7485,Noice
7486,.
7487,"Fun game, nice replacement to Sim City!"
7488,"I saw xQC play this and he did a terrible job and I thought man, I don't even like these kind of video games but he is just SO bad at it that I thought even I could figure it out better than him. And I wanted to prove this to myself so I bought the game. I like."
7489,love this game clams me down
7490,make city go brrrrrrr
7491,Amazing game! I tried it then had to purchase on steam for the mods! let the OCD take over!
7492,Don't buy this game.  The user interfaces are extremely clunky and counter intuitive.   No tutorials to walk you through setting up the city to run.  After 1 hour.  I had nothing to show for it.  Very frustrating game.  Don't get it.  Worst $30 spent that I will never see again.
7493,never thought managing traffic flow could be so fun
7494,Hard to get at first and controls are wonky but you can change controls and figure out how to play like most games
7495,"Ratings are below. Rating is rated from 1-10.

Graphics- 7.5, No options for more powerful graphics HOWEVER can handle large cities and be played on many different computer types.

Gameplay-9.5, Great city builder and simulation! Many modpacks and DLCs. Would recommend to fans of city-building games!
Overall design- Good, Basic design and can be easily changed using all the modpacks!
Other- Glitches common. Will not run well on lower-running devices. Great fan base and community in general."
7496,it is fun and i like it. go play it big time fun
7497,!

7508,one of the games ever
7509,Great with mods.
7510,"It's a great game for getting your brain ticking. You've got to think how to keep citizens happy by providing all the essentials (medical, police, fire, education, sanitary services & utilities), providing plenty jobs, transport links, beauty spots etc all while turning a profit - not easy but it's a good game to lose the track of time with. Would recommend if you are in to simulation casual build em' up games."
7511,I like that I can build a city without having to fight wars.
7512,remember SimCity? no? im old...
7513,"Great attention to detail. Many problem solving opportunities.

7528,"good game

7529,"Played it on console during PS Plus monthly free game, had to buy it on PC as well. Probably put > 200 hours in. It's mind-numbingly addicting for those with a penchant for world building and minutia-oriented."
7530,Nice game to pass the time
7531,yup
7532,"Great game, if you can use Paradox launcher ! 
Come on guys, i'm a gamer not a PC doctor."
7533,Yes
7534,Anyone who loves geography I 100% recommend this game!
7535,Good.
7536,"great game with many hours able to be dumped in without even noticing, very good modern simcity type game"
7537,"This game would have been the best builder if the developers weren't so lazy.
Instead of adding meaningful updates they just add new chirps....(?) 
There's no hope for this game and the reason is simple: Many years have passed and nothing, just chirps and DLCs that should have been in the game in the first place for unacceptable prices. Hope my words will be heard. 
*** BYE ONLY ON SALE AND PLAY IT WITH MODS ***"
7538,funny city game
7539,ya
7540,"Cities Skylines is an amazing game and a true replacement for the Sim City series. Base game is decently priced and the DLC's are a good value too. While most DLC should be added to the base game I would still recommend purchasing it all.
9/10"
7541,It is the best CITY BUILDING GAME IN THE WORLD 100% worth the purchase.
7542,It's a fun game but it can get redundant and frustrating once your city gets larger as traffic is almost uncontrolable in some cases.

7551,"Good old simple fun. Reminds me when Sim City was a good game to play, but better."
7552,pro tip: start a new game
7553,"It's a fun and challenging game. You've got to mentally balance all aspects of your society and grow them one step ahead of population booms. It is very unique. I enjoy playing immensely. You can also focus on keeping your city small and just go for beautification, planting trees, laying sidewalks, adding benches, etc. There's no limit to what you can pursue."

HOWWW??? OMG"
7555,Nice game!
7556,"Cities Skylines is a solid choice for anyone looking to manage and plan their own cities the game has the same learning curve to it just like other paradox games(Stellaris,CK3 and etc) what I really love about this game is how managing traffic becomes a late game issue as underground roads need to be planned as well for better public transport so citizens don't have to drive everywhere. But this game wouldn't be a paradox game if you didn't have to sift through all the DLCs and decide which ones are mandatory if you've played Stellaris this will make sense if not I apologize Industries and Campus are akin to Utopia and green cities and nightlife are similar to federations and Leviathans Both of them could of been free content updates since they both should already be in the game or mods already handled the issues before but are worth having since they add different avenues for you to choose."
7557,Great.
7558,it is good
7559,Best city sandbox

"
7565,amazing
7566,"fucking love this game now need a better pc to play it on lol
"
7567,Waste of money. Not optimised for Mac. Even a 1920x1080 is lagging on the M1 mini. Terrible graphic even on the 4K resolution. Annoying background music. Maybe it runs and looks better on PC.
7568,Addictive. Fun. Awesome. Very pretty. Very recommended.
7569,It is fun
7570,"I'm sure this would knock a city planner's socks off. Unfortunately, I don't know how the hell to design a city."
7571,"I just disliked the lag for low end PCs.
"
7572,very nice city planner game with tons of free and paid expansions and mods
7573,Ist sehr gut aber ohne dlc's Geht nix
7574,The best city building game out there
7575,It's the perfect balance between strategy and casual play.
7576,"If you love city planing, this is an excellent game that you can spend hours doing a session, AND FEEL SATISFIED WITH THE PROGRESS and not get addicted. It really is like doing a puzzle"
7577,love it
7578,This is what Sim City should have been...
7579,"Love this game! I highly recommend you give this game a try. It has lots of mods, DLC, and you can design all kinds of cities.

Thanks Paradox for such a fun game to play."
7580,The game if fun and has end less possibility for building the a city the way you want
7581,
7582,I have just always been a fan a of simulation games. This takes Sim City to a whole new level.

7604,I played this game years ago but it doesn't seem to work any more. Many of the installed mods are no longer on steam so I'm stuck with game that just crashes and am I'm unable to remove the bad mods with the content manager.
7605,The only thing you should know..... This is an amazing game that will keep you awake for hours!
7606,Time Waster but oh what a lovely way to waste time!
7607,good
7608,.
7609,WoW i have my own city :o
7610,gud
7611,10000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000% EASIER TO GET/MAKE MODS THAN ANY OTHER GAME I HAVE #GET CITY SKYLINES
7612,It's just really a nice game
7613,Too many dlc but besides that good game
7614,Best city builder
7615,Really fun game when you're bored
7616,Big city go brrrrr
7617,"Best yum city building yuh
"
7618,"it is a fun and enjoyable game however due to the very nature of the game it can be very tedious, however it is simple to play"
7619,Really enjoying this game.  It is very in-depth and detailed.  Will keep you playing for many hours.  100 times better than sim city.
7620,Steep learning curve but a fun game once you learn how to play. Be sure to load up on the most popular mods. They add a lot to the experience.
7621,Nice game. Prefer to download mods for better gaming experiences
7622,mindless and strategical at the same time. one of the best games I've ever played. Mods are highly recommended.
7623,Building :)
7624,"Incredibly engrossing, whether you are a big city builder, a focused detailer or a casual player. The game has unlimited re-play potential, even after a break of many months it still feels exciting when you get back into it. The Steam Workshop is packed with thousands of outstanding mods and assets, or you can go down the vanilla route. Either way, the game will continually entice you to 'have another go' at designing that perfect city. Highly recommended."
7625,it is a place to make your dream city you can put on infinty money can bulid houses and so much more. This game helped me realise that i am capble of so much! i hope you like this game just like i do
7626,I most recommend for gamer who love sim city.
7627,"Large game with endless replayability. Mod support is out of this world, and makes the game replay different and exciting each playthrough."
7628,Will not open

7631,great

7634,"Controls are nonsense and I'm not sure the display settings actually do anything. 
I have 6 hours in the game right now and it was all spent either trying to fix something with the software or convincing myself that the game would eventually get fun. So the gameplay is a no for me, personally."
7635,Good
7636,it's real good
7637,Great way to escape & build your own cities

7662,Can't switch the client from full screen to window mode in GFX settings. This is forcing the game to only run on my left screen which is not my main gaming screen. My left screen is also vertical.

7671,traffic jam simulator
7672,"I've been playing this game for quite some time now. I got it for free on ""Epic Games"". Had so much fun that I decided to buy it on steam and have a try with the mods. IT is amazing!
"
7673,"Great game and modding community. Dope devs who interact and care about the community. W game W Studio
"
7674,"This is the best city building sim game. I enjoyed it a lot at beggining. But it has some little problems that gamer comunity has seen since the first year that developers dont want to fix and that make huge bad impact on the game enjoyability:
1- There are some stupid ""bugs"" like when you try to connect two roads that are in different high. They dont connect with a gradual gradient so a simple build become a 10 minute nemesis.
2- You need mods to play it. The game is simply incomplete. Mods like Move it, trafic manager, etc. And then you will find problems with compatibility mods, problems with your ram dying, random crashes where you loose all your city, ...
3- There is no medium density zoning. I cant believe that. So you can choose between individual houses with gardens and big urban buildings with 5 or more floors, but you have no mid term. I have never seen any city that can be copied with this limitations. Developers simply dont care.
4- If I want to build a city that looks a little like any real city I have to do a lot of mod use and micro modeling selecting each building.
It's a shame because with little changes it could become a lot better. Its a game with a lot of potential wasted."
7675,A very good city simulator. It is an easy going game with an amazing UI and build features but lacks any kind of challenge. The DLCs are nice as well.
7676,It's far more challenging than SimCity. The creators have done a great job!
7677,"great time passer, easy to understand.  good for me while on the road [im a truck driver]"
7678,I love this game! it is so much better than sims city and has a large amount of mods from a great community!
7679,It will consume your life. I told my friends about it and it soon consumed theirs as well. be prepared.
7680,"Sim City on steroids!! I've played every Sims game since... well the beginning of Sims games. This is the most realistic  city building simulation game out there, with an unfathomable amount of add on"
7681,RIP PC
7682,:)
7683,Very fun
7684,Best city builder I've ever played.
7685,"By far the best building strategy in recent years. I bought the game in 2015 and I'm still playing it. Thanks to the community, the game is greatly improved with mods and assets. Without exaggeration you can create a city that looks like a real one. It's no problem to spend several hours at a stretch with the game. The game will completely engulf you.
New and new DLC is coming to the game. Some are not much, but some are really good (Campus, Industries, etc...).
If you want to have a city similar to reality you have to use mods and assets. As the number grows, the demand on RAM increases.
If you are looking for a builder strategy. You won't find better. I can only recommend it."
7686,"When I was little, I used to build 3-D models of cities all the time. When I was in intermediate school, my family got our first computer, and I bought a simulated city game that I played all the way up through college, but it was limited by the technology of the day. When I saw Cities Skylines, it was brand new. I'm a nickel-pincher, so I gave it due consideration before buying it. I wanted to see if I could create a major city growing on both sides of a border where on one side they drive on the left, and the other side they drive on the right. I found out you can't really do that in this game, but I got hooked anyway. I'm mostly interested in the civil engineering aspects, which are a little limited, but gaming computers aren't advanced enough yet to not be limited. With mods and assets, which are free if you're willing to risk it (or know how to mitigate your risks), you can at least pretend to do just about anything. Like real cities, managing traffic is a never-ending challenge that pushes my creativity to come up with solutions. My chief complaint is that if I have two intersections that are too close, the game never stops warning me that they may cause traffic problems, even though I wouldn't leave them there if they did. Usually those intersections are pieces of makeshift roundabouts. That's easy to ignore though. I could go on, but I'm probably already boring you.  o=)"

It's fairly easy to get into, but do know that this eventually become a traffic management game.

You'll eventually get into modding, and that's when the game become the best for you.

DLCs are also great, but wait for sales :)"
7712,"good game
"
7713,good
7714,Good city building game I love playing it and it doesn't really get old. I would 420% recommend it.
7715,"I would give a no if it weren't such a good game. It's screwing up my productivity and I haven't slept since I got it. I've never seen a more addictive game since Factorio. Holy shit. Do not buy this game if you value sleep, health, or grades."
7716,"Very Fun! Plus, you get creative freedom."
7717,"pretty great way to waste 12 hours at a time
"
7718,"bro. i love this game and i dont like a lot of games...
you like any (doesnt have to be all or even more than one)
-Political ""Roleplay""
-City Building
-Economy making
-Airport making/operating
-disasters
-managment
-design
then this game is for you."
7719,the amount of dopamine release I get out of playing this game is insane. Every asset I plop down is an orgasm of the brain
7720,fun game to think out of the box and strategy
7721,if you can manage to get past the loading screens you'll be ok.
7722,"like, build city and"
7723,Half my city got COVID
7724,"This game should be called City Scam. 
Basic content that should be available in the core game is hidden behind the pay wall called DLC.
Seriously.. Basic content that has no business being separate from the core of the game is not present. 

I can't recommend this to anyone unless you don't mind paying extra for things that should be in the core game."
7725,"Best city builder, mods are incredible"
7726,"great game
"
7727,"Disclaimer: Played Cities a while back, shared it with my brother who has it on his account.

I'm thumbing Cities down because of it's total pricing, currently sitting on € 247,18.
Now that's not to say you need all the DLC in order to have a fun experience - but figuring out which DLC to get for a game you're thinking of getting is a terrible experience and just not a consumer friendly practice."
7728,Great game
7729,"Good game, just add-ons are a bit pricey sometimes and you need a LOT of mods for it to be what you expect when you install it tbh"
7730,"If I had reviewed the game in 2015 or even some years after, I'd have recommended it. Today I can't recommend it anymore because of:

- questionable launcher (though, there are workarounds)
- DLC prices
- poorly optimized

Loading takes ages, memory usage is extremely high even without workshop content nor DLC. Despite not having the best computer I used to play this game smoothly. Today I can't even play the base game anymore. In my experience, you will not really be able to run it with 8 GB RAM. I am playing on Linux where the system requirements are even lower, but those don't match the reality at all (minimum & recommended)!"
7731,Good times.
7732,"A great game with many options that you fine tune and hundreds of mods that you can ad.
One issue I have been experiencing and didn't find an easy solution for is that you get traffic jams because all the cars choose the same line to drive on while one or more lines are free."
7733,Sussy but in a good in a good way
7734,Sim city but not form EA! HEH
7735,Paradox
7736,if you like infrastructure this is your game!
7737,if you dont know about this game by now where have you been? this is truly the current leader in city builders
7738,dont save your game in the cloud!!!!
7739,"This game is genuenly ecxelent.

Sorry my spelling isn't that good."
7740,"This is the best modern City simulator. 
"
7741,it is
7742,yes
7743,"Cities: Skylines เกมที่จะให้สวมบทเป็นผู้บริหารเมือง โดยคุณจะต้องจัดการกับปัญหา ให้บริการ หาเงินและหาคนเข้าเมือง
ในส่วนตัวเกมก็คือเกมบริหารเมืองดีๆถึงขั้นยอดเยี่ยม โดยเราจะต้องสร้างถนนหนทางให้ประชาเข้ามาในตัวเมืองและวางสิ่งที่อำนวยความสะดวกให้คนที่อยากจะมาอาศัยในเมืองนี้ เช่น การสร้างโรงงานไฟฟ้า การสร้างเครื่องสูบน้ำ การปล่อยน้ำเสีย ที่เก็บขยะ หรือสิ่งอำนวยความสะดวกพื้นฐานต่างๆที่คนในเมืองนี้ต้องใช้ แต่ตัวเกมมีสิ่งที่ทำให้เราต้องตัดสินใจอยู่เกือบตลอดเวลา ไม่ว่าปัญหาของขยะล้นเมือง ผู้คนป่วยกันทั้งเมืองโดยที่เราต้องหาปัญหาเอาเอง การสังเกตเมืองคือสิ่งสำคัญ ซึ่งควรจะต้องทำ รู้ไหมไอสัส (ไม่ได้บอกนะว่าหมายถึงใคร) เกมนี้เหมาะกับคนที่ชอบการบริหารบ้านเมืองเองหรือคนที่อยากจะบริหารบ้านเมืองในชีวิตจริงๆก็ใช้เกมนี้เป็นตัวช่วยได้

ข้อเสียเล็กๆน้อยๆ
NPCในเมืองจะทำอะไรโง๋ๆหน่อยเช่น มีคนป่วยและเรามีโรงพยาบาลหลายแห่ง ไอที่ไกลๆมักจะมารับซึ่งเป็นสาเหตุให้การจราจรในเมืองอาจจะติดขัด เพราะโรงบาลใกล้ๆเสือกไม่่รับผู้ป่วย ซึ่งการกระทำNPCก็จะประมาณนี้ที่ทำให้เราหงุดหงิดเป็นบางครั้ง 

ในส่วนเรื่องสเปคคอมที่ใช้เล่นควรจะอยู่ในขั้นแนะนำของเกมยิ่งสูงยิ่งดี เพราะยิ่งเมืองใหญ่ก็ยิ่งเกิดอาการเกมค้างหรือแลคได้

สรุป
นี้คือเกมบริหารเมืองที่มีองค์ประกอบสมจริงในระดับหนึ่ง โดยที่ข้อเสียเป็นเพียงแค่NPCที่บางทีเราอาจจะมองข้ามไปก็ไม่มีปัญหามาก ต้องลองเล่นและควรจะรู้สึกถึงการดูดเวลาไปชีวิตมาก

7744,im all in. It be nice to have gaming centers as part of the areas to build on the map
7745,"At 478 hours in 4 weeks, I feel as if I have stumbled across possibly my favorite game of all time. It's engaging, demanding, and over all just great time consuming fun, It beats a similar title from a rather big box company  (E*cough*A*cough*) BY LIGHTYEARS. 

System Requirements: I would highly recommend having a very powerful machine. I have 32gb of DDR4 3600 and I FREQUENTLY hit 28+GB usage in a session with mods. I'm looking to upgrade to 128gb to see if that helps with the excessive SSD access rate, but I have an Nvidia RTX 2070 Super  and Ryzen 9 3900X and I don't have any issues getting the game fluid at playable framerates without huge lag spikes on max settings until i get larger (100k +) populations. 

I recommend the DLC. All of it. Trust me... There are some necessary things missing from the base game... which brings me to my first set of points. The bad/complaints part...

I only have two complaints: 1. All of the DLC should have been included with the base game, or at least the functions that are available now since updates. Things like 4 lane highways and Multiple variations of service buildings would be great to have when you are first starting out, but I understand they (Colossal Order) need to make money, and that's acceptable. They deserve it after making such a cool game. 

2.  NODE/CIM/OBJECT/BUILDING/CAR LIMITS. I understand the need to code limits into the game because not everyone has a powerful computer. Make a toggle for people who do, or upgrade the code to support a bit more space (ie 81tiles mod) or just more of everything in general. I would love to see this same simulation with real-life numbers for day/night cities like New York or Dubai. 20x the current limit and enable the upgrade via toggle in the mods menu for people with really powerful machines and you would have LITERALLY the ultimate city cim. 

"
7746,Good game. Please buy game.
7747,"Cities: Skylines is the perfect sandbox for someone who wants to dip their toes into a city-building game without the wild scenarios. If you want a more challenging experience, be prepared to shell out for the many expansions and content packs that are sold separately."
7748,Good game
7749,Yes
7750,"Kinda a ripoff with all the DLC, but the base game's solid still."
7751,"awesome game ... i bought base DLCs and i will buy all the other DLCs for summer sale.
i hope u will add Zombie Disaster to the game and military bases to manage military power. 
i wish if u could do something like when people unhappy they protest."
7752,Easy to follow.
7753,fun
7754,The mod support in this already good game is unreal!
7755,Fun game
7756,A very great game but it's not famous . I hope we can help this game become the most famous city game ever!
7757,"Was great to play, would love to play more, however, the game has not started for me since January 2022 due to Paradox Launcher not functioning. I have spent the last 2 months exhausting every resource I can find without any solution: help through Steam & Paradox, contacting Paradox (spending a month in back-and-forth emails that did not fix the issue), scouring the web for anyone that has had this (rather common) issue, uninstalling and deleting any files or folders related Steam, Cities: Skylines, or Paradox, installing on different drives (3 SSD's, 2 HDD's).
I am looking forward to playing CS again, but can not recommend it as I can not play it."

7759,"really fun, gets even better with dlc"
7760,ye
7761,Great game that runs well on my old laptop and is such a good realistic game with endless possibilities.
7762,good
7763,Great potential with this game; there are a few minor annoyances but I imagine Paradox will get around to fixing them eventually. (Notifications obscure controls; info panels block the players' view of the build tool.)
7764,Very relaxing game.
7765,"As in the real world, the main problem in this simulator is traffic. It should be illegal to carry a car in your pocket."
7766,"Great game. 
Realistic city management, traffic and public transport system. Amazing graphics and buildings. There's also an active and helpful mod community which provides mods and assets that will definitely help you build your dream city. 
But there ARE some small glitches of vehicles and other features, don't affect the gameplay, yet make the city a bit unrealistic and glitchy. 
I wholeheartedly recommend this game to everyone who likes city-builing games and those who would like to try this kind of game."
7767,I Love building the city of Larbert so Adam Mcdonald can live in it.
7768,Best city simulator right now. Insanely good mod scene.
7769,"Hey, You...

Do you love that old city game, you know which one. This is the game you have been looking for for the last 10 years. Great mechanics, cool maps, great graphics, very deep world creator."
7770,like
7771,"This is a really fun game if you have the right computer. This one got too big for my computer (due to mods and DLC's). I'll miss it but, I'm not willing to wait 30+ minutes for the city to upload."
7772,"Yes, I recommend the main game to anyone who likes chill city builders with lots of options, tweaks and pretty good graphics. No, I do not like or condone the DLC policy of Paradox; and if you have to release 12 main DLC expansions to basically complete a game, instead of including as free updates or releases, you charge (way exorbitantly IMO) for all of them, then you are glutenous and don't comprehend how gaming should work.  You are no better than EA in this practice.  I know that Paradox wants to make money, and it is their IP, their decision, and I get that, but I do not respect that, and it is why I refuse to get anymore DLC for this game, even when on sale.  I cannot support this behavior, its the worst and most toxic.  Still, at the end of it all, the game is still well made, fun and worth picking up the main game but when on sale, as big a sale as you can find - do not pay full price if you can help it."
7773,Haha accidentally poison the water supply and nearly kill my entire population go brrr
7774,Great game
7775,yeah
7776,The Sim City we always wanted (that EA murdered).
7777,While this game has a lot of pluses the sheer number of DLCs has really frustrated me. I've always felt if they produce a lot of DLCs then you shouldn't have to purchase them all again if you move platforms. If I want them all again for PC I'm looking at £168 currently. That's insane.

7779,good game
7780,"good game
"
7781,sit down and do nothing but stare at screen for hours on end 10/10 love this game
7782,"So far, this is the best city builder game"
7783,Dank
7784,.
7785,The voices told me to flood the city with poop
7786,good
7787,Great game with real depth. You can sink hours into this and never get bored. Loading does take a long time and can also cause game to crash. After loading there are no issues. Needs optimisation.
7788,
7789,Why is it no longer possible to install this game on Steam?
7790,"When I work a hard day, I can't come home and sweat my gonads off to a hardcore shooter like Ready or Not, Insurgency, Halo etc - I need a game to chill out. This is perfect. Government employees don't work fast, and neither do you playing this. Pour a scotch, light a cuban and tweak residential and industrial zones to hearts content. Highly recommended."
7791,Is great
7792,asd
7793,"This game is really good and if you install workshop content, it makes it even better. You could play this for hours on end."
7794,"Sorry my review is so late, I was stuck in traffic.

Got this game in 2015 when my computer was even crappier than it is now. This is THE city building game. I remember having bought the new SimCity game back then and well, being majorly disappointed. This game is everything you would want from a city building game. Don't miss out on it!"
7795,"Best city builder you could probably get today.
Sucks that a lot of the game content is behind many dlcs.
Found the game becomes quite miserable when you have a large population unless you spend countless hours optimising connections around the city and even then your traffic may still be garbo.
You might enjoy that aspect though so give it a go :)"
7796,"really good game, just need some essnetial mods and its pretty gud, i would also recommend purchasing the dlcs since they add A LOT to the game"
7797,"Very Immersive, Great Interface and customizability of city with mods."
7798,"I want to like this game. I loved sim city and other city building games, so this genre is definitely one I normally like. However, it is difficult to fix problems in your cities. The game play is not easy to figure out and the tutorial teaches you very little. I learned most of the game from youtube gamers which are much more helpful. I last played in 2019 because I just could not get into the game. I retried in 2022 to see if updates made a difference, and they don't. There are much better city builders out there. Pass on this one."
7799,best for designing cities because you can't irl
7800,Dope game. Takes effort to really excel at but worth the time investment.
7801,amzing
7802,sorta works
7803,Missing Ninja 1.2/10 😡😡😡
7804,.
7805,one of the best if not the best city making simulator
7806,love this game. Its a really fun game to sit back relax and play but still challenge yourself. I give it a 9/10 there could be some more simplicity to controlling traffic and some of the services.
7807,meteor go brrrrr
7808,"Currently, I've played this game for more than 30 hours. I can play this game for a long time and still be very interested and invested. This game allows me to build a civilization and manage it like a real mayor. I get to make a city based on MY terms and be my cities own Mayor. This game plays smoothly on my 2011 Macbook Pro on very low graphics but works and runs quite smoothly. I can be doing my school work while playing this game. 10/10, would recommend. (However, I highly suggest buying this game on sale like I suggest with any other game unless the game is regularly cheap.) DLC's are nice but not needed to enjoy the game."
7809,"Classic City Builder game. Great to pass some time and easy to learn.

Do not look at the number of DLC before buying, the game does not need them to be fun."
7810,Take that SimCity franchise !!! Now someone needs to take on the Sims please.
7811,"city
"
7812,yes
7813,Very engaging
7814,its good
7815,ita a game that can be challenging at first but also allows you to be creative especially with the dlcs and mods
7816,good
7817,"Aliasing on text is terrible, on multiple graphics cards with multiple monitor resolutions.  The developer doesn't care to fix it or respond to bug reports.  This has been a problem for _years_, reported on Steam and on their official forums."
7818,Best CITY SiM out there.
7819,"Good game, play now"
7820,yes
7821,wertyui
7822,
7823,"I love city planning games. I started with SimCity. Now, retired, I'm looking forward to playing Skylines again, and with the updates :)"
7824,"[b]DO NOT get me wrong![/b] It is the [b]best city building game[/b] out there imo but the BIGGEST CON outweighting everything is the publisher being Paradox.. DLC situation is pretty much a circus and them being clowns advertising it. Some of these things should be in the base game, some DLCs do not work properly without the need of another DLC.."
7825,"Okat listen up, if youre on the verge to buy the game, look at the dlc list. If youre ready to buy atleast 2 of those then go ahead and buy the game and the dlcs. On the other hand if you dont want to purchase the dlcs, dont bother. This game is very cool game but without the dlcs it is heavily bare bones, its the same formula :
City needs more houses!
Houses need more commercial!
Commercial needs more Industrial!
Industrail needs more houses!
But with dlcs you need more care for the city.
TLDR:
Game sucks without dlcs."
7826,"Very Nice
"
7827,"Be careful, super addictive"
7828,"Spent 25 minutes trying align the cargo rail station with the train tracks. Watched 2 tutorial videos on how to do it. 127 hours later, I still don't know how to make a road curve at a 45 degree angle. I can also confirm that truck drivers in this game have 0 intelligence and will always take the busiest possible road to get anywhere. I built a massive city, everything was going well, then decided it was time to fix traffic issues. I deleted some roads and now I don't know how to connect my city back together again. 100% would do it again, brilliant game."

7834,"Been playing this game for years!!  And they still keep making more DLC's!  I have yet to even play with the new Airports mod and I'm currently playing,  There is just epic content!"
7835,Yes make so many crazy cities can always come back to this game LOVE IT!
7836,its good
7837,"Its pretty cool, If I'm honest. I just like throwing meteors at schools and burning them down. Its fun! 10/10 would recommend (Unless you got a potato PC)"
7838,"doidimais da conta
"
7839,"Good game, but time flies by when you play. Spent 10 hours in one go."
7840,Nada que agregar a lo que ya se haya dicho sobre este juego. 50% de la diversión es arreglar las congestiones de tráfico.
7841,The best city builder game on market...and workshop assets and mods make it even better!!!  10/0
7842,"If it walks like a duck, and quacks like a duck, it's probably bad lane math."
7843,"Very great game.
Only thing is that the sewage-system only makes sense with the Green Cities DLC"
7844,i LOVEEEE this game
7845,"Cities: Skylines has long been the premier city-building game. You can create anything a genuine city has (or not). It's a lot of fun, and I'm always curious to see what occurs next. It is something I would suggest to everyone. From people who enjoy building poop volcanoes/lagoons to people who enjoy designing road networks. The game is suitable for all types of people."
7846,goooooooooooooooooooooooooood
7847,I love this game
7848,Cities Skylines is a fun game. The mods and assets that you can get for free on the workshop make the game even better. The DLC that you can buy also makes the game a lot more fun having more things to do and use. I highly recommend getting this game and looking at the workshop and DLC's for more fun.
7849,yes recomen
7850,Best city sim I've ever played.
7851,I LICK IT
7852,cool game good time yes
7853,very nice game if you are into dissociating for multiple hours at a time
7854,Haha meteors go brrrrrrrrrrr
7855,.
7856,good stuff
7857,nashe
7858,Honestly one of the best if not the best and most accurate city building simulators you can find out there.
7859,"I've played this game since the day it came out. It is genuinely up there with one of the best city-builders ever made. Its options are extremely diverse and the expansions are surprisingly good (considering paradox sometimes makes things overpriced). I highly recommend this game to anyone who likes playing city-builders, or if they want to try one for the first time."
7860,cool
7861,"I bought this game when it first came out and was pretty impressed.  However, it had a lot of problems.  I slinked off it for years at a time, periodically coming back expecting some of its major demons to have been excised only to be continually disappointed.  I could ramble on for hours about all its issues and also its strengths, but let me find a few examples of where it falls on its face, hard enough to get a thumbs down from me.  Elevated Highways: if you have heart problems, it is advisable to avoid try this in this as it will possibly kill you.  Building the actual road isn't that bad, but finding a path for off-ramps in an existing city (retrofitting) is incredibly difficult to the point where you feel like taking 20 screenshots to rant on a form of how stupid each design decision was.  Trying to put in the highway first works until you realize that building under it will NOT move all the road pillars and snaking your way around these makes the whole exercise nearly pointless because it is much more messy than just putting it on the ground.  An intersection takes up about 10% of a block, which is just insane you you want to maximize space.  This doesn't mean that you would enjoy the game as say a young person that hasn't played Sim City games.  I played the original 1989 version for 100's of hours and loved it.  I played every abomination since then, and still have not found any that really did much for the genre other than make it prettier and add just more of the same stuff.  Not that it matters here, but the 2013 Sim City game was so promising with concept that it was super exciting, until the execution was realized to be one of the biggest disappointments in game history.  The idea of a real world economy was amazing, but never even turned on.  It had on entrance to the city which became utter gridlock no matter what you did.  This game beats that by a long shot as a pure city builder, but somebody, somewhere needs to do this right, plus the economy part.  That would get my dollars.  It is far from a simple feat.  Anyway, my advise to the devs here would be, if they ever build another game, make it significantly more playable for all aspects of the game.  Also, look into the economy stuff that Sim City 2013 did and see if you can do it right.  The hardware advancements should make that possible to do now as I think it was just unplayable then with all the processor required to run it as designed."
7862,"Wonderful God like time waster
"
7863,Amazing detail and a great city builder game. I have spend hundreds of hours on this game and still cant get enough.
7864,divertido para pasar el tiempo

7877,Awesome game!
7878,Been playing city builders since SimCity was first released back in 1989. This one is the best!

7880,What SimCity could have been.

7882,"Greatest City builder game out there, I've played on xbox and pc well over 1000 hours and will never play sim city again."

7913,What can I say great game! Great game development company!
7914,"Get it, but get the autosave mod!"
7915,This game truly makes me build.
7916,"This game. Has affected me. In so many Ways. It hath shown me the way of life. How to breath and truly feel it. I never understood life until I purchased this game. I am in tears. This is the best game I have every played in my entire life. I am free. Are we all living in a city in Cities: Skylines? Has the owner not logged on to add anything new? Or add a new disaster to this world? Is that what it is? Are we all being perceived under small LED fragmented pixels through a screen in a room? Is our human lifeline dependent on a small electrical wire plugged into a wall? This game has brought up questions as such that I have pondered for many days. Thank you, Cities: Skylines. I feel the oxygen in the air. The wind between the trees. The mountains in the sky call out to me. I venture. The world feels and understands it. The sky begs for a break from the tension it endures day by day. The trees relieve it through the night.  The world understands it once more. The human begs for a drop of life from the trend the rest experience. The world provides because it understands itself. Cities: Skylines has rewrote the basic human nature and line of life. It has rewrote the way we live. It has rewrote the ecosystems, the trees, the atmosphere, the clouds. Thank you. I feel so amazing once more."

7933,"This game will make your IRL daily commute more frustrating than you ever thought possible.  

As you drive down the four- to six-lane main road to and from your workplace and come to traffic light after traffic light, each intersection connected to small pockets of houses with businesses all along the way, cars pulling into and out of parking lots and storefronts, buses cutting you off, no sidewalks for pedestrians to walk on, and no bike lanes for cyclists, you'll find yourself screaming and fiercely searching online for what MORONS of traffic engineers and city planners had their heads so far up their asses that they allowed this ABOMINATION of a road to ever exist in the first place.

7952,Very fun game. Lots to build.
7953,I like that I can play at a lower level without a lot of knowledge of civil engineering and still have tons of room to grow and learn while I play. The online community is awesome too. I am continually amazed by the talent here.
7954,its a very fun game if you like citybuilders. There are also lots of mods and DLCs so its a lot of game contents. I would really reccomend it to anyone who likes citybuilders.
7955,stuff
7956,"My largest city - the County of Storpappastan L - 600,000 population, 85% average traffic and 8-11,000 transit riders each week

My favorite part of the city - the 6 train tracks abreast corridor with 2 roads above and underneath. And at the underpass, a power substation, recycling center and downs of tents for the homeless cities. The area is filled with people walking around among the tents, trash, and graffiti.

Don't listen to what the vast majority tell you - make your first starting block interested. Tell  a story. Then grow the next block as part of your story. Eventually you can build the best city in vanilla without any DLC's

Add the DLC's and workshop items later on your 2nd or 3rd major proeject."
7957,nice
7958,"The greatest city builder of all time. Simply put. The cost of the DLCs ruins my motivation to acquire them, but if you got the wallet to handle them, go for it. I have plenty of fun without hundreds of dollars' worth of purchases, YEARS after its release. I even have it on console.

Get your achievements before you get mods. You won't want to play without a lot of them, once you're used to having them."

The citizens also have very fancy sports cars and can sometimes ""accidentally"" drown in a tsunami of crap from some strange volcano that just appeared out of NOWHERE in their backyards. Cruise ships have no trouble with those poop tsunamis too. 

But all jokes aside, this game is the best fricking city builder and one of my all time favourites, only downside is the dlc's are a bit dear and my game drops to 30fps when i zoom in to check out all the dogs, jumping and spinning around like they took three vita gummies instead of two or some shit, waiting for their bus trip.

7982,"City Skylines is a building simulation game that focuses on area zoning, road and path placements, public services, public transportation, taxes, and policies. City Skylines encourages players to plan out their cities and meticulously build roads and buildings. Players will have to control the demand for residential, commercial, and industrial zones as this will grow your city.  

Residents will require essential services such as electricity, clean flowing water, sewage treatment, and trash collection. Players will also need to provide a police department, a fire department, healthcare, education, leisure, and public transportation. With a limited budget to spend growing the city you will have to provide these services and ensure that they are effective. Players can choose and construct their own industrial areas such as crop and forestry harvesting, and ore and oil extraction. Players can also build different parks like zoos, aquariums, and theme parks (with the parks DLC). The most difficult part of this game is to control the increases in population and the increase in traffic as cities grow. Players will need to construct new highways, complex intersections, and junctions to ensure traffic flows smoothly throughout their cities. Public transportation will also play a vital role in reducing traffic and congestion on roads. There are buses, metro, monorail, train, boat, and airplane facilities available for players to create transportation routes. If public transport routes are efficient, vehicle traffic can be reduced significantly. 

City Skylines is a and is a well-rounded game and I can see that developers put effort into this project. I can advocate and say many remarkable things about this game but there are a few issues I need to address\The only thing I can say is that I used to love this game, it's a relaxing city sim but there is a problem with all the add-ons for the game. Old features got removed and placed into new DLCs which they want you now to buy for a total of just over $250. The add-ons are what make this game incredible, but for the price, some can argue that it is not worth it. Overall, this game is an amazing way to spend your free time as 6 hours can feel like 30 minutes when you play the game. However, you will have to consider the expensive add-ons to experience this game fully."

7993,"I got this game thinking it would be absolutely awful like all those stupid mobile games, but after playing for a bit, I love it. If you don't wanna dive deep in city planning, your city will still run, so its great for those casual people. However, if you want, you can get your city running amazing by planning according, which can be surprisingly tricky. 
Recommend 100%"
7994,Fun!!
7995,Incredible game even without the DLC.
7996,Always fun  to play and get your mind off of things.
7997,"sometimes good sometimes maybe shit
"
7998,"This is the direction SimCity should have gone. Traffic management is a genuine engaging challenge, and it is fun to micromanage decor to create your perfect city. Wish the DLC policy was better, maybe more content in expansions for the price?"
7999,"It's an OK game but the amount of DLC and how dumb the AI can be sometimes regarding traffic can really be annoying.

Also it's sometimes boring building a lone city. You can't connect the cities to a larger metropolitan area which is sad since Sim City, which came out 2 years earlier, had that functionality. Also, you can't build megaprojects or multiplayer, which both were functionality in Sim City.

It's an OK game if you purchase the DLCs as and when you want to play them. Wouldn't pay full-price ever."
8000,"I like this game, it is the best city builder on the market. However, they've gone full EA Sims with the DLC. It would cost nearly $300 to get the full-game and it isn't worth that. They know it isn't worth that. It is a scam in a toxic industry that treats their customers as nothing more than a cash farm. Would recommend buying the base game, but probably wait for a sell just to punish their greed."
8001,Great product. Expertly removes all that stubborn extra time you might have lying around!
8002,...
8003,The best city builder in existence.
8004,No submarines... But still good.
8005,"i liked how creative you can be in this game

8006,pretty good game overall

8010,"i use to play on PS4 this game

really fun, i recommend it. 

On my opinion, better then simcity

Only bad side of the game is the DLC, but sometimes you can find them at good special deal. 

Anyway, you wont regret it!"
8011,very fun + mods very fun and cool
8012,Many diffrent aspects looking into making a city. Really makes you appreciate the job of real city planners.
8013,8/10
8014,fun if you like building cities
8015,Its great! I love it!
8016,i have never had this many annoying bugs in one game
8017,"A fun sim, but the way they nickel and dime you is incredible. You can't even gain all the achievements without buying multiple dlc's."
8018,"Just get it if you like to plan and build,it's very satisfying watching your little town grow to a metropolis."
8019,das epic
8020,I am building Monke Town right now.
8021,nice city builder
8022,Its a great management game. The only criticism is that it sucks RAM and CPU to run.
8023,sick as
8024,i love this game so much. i would recomend to anyone that loves building.
8025,"The game stopped working. I love the game, but I'm very disaaponited that it doesn't even lauch. I have tried the noWorkshop thing but still doesn't lUNCH. i'M THINKING OF RETURNING IT.
"
8026,city must grow
8027,"Its like Sim City, but not Sim City"
8028,"A really fun game, a bit expensive but 100% worth it. you could spend days on end playing this game without ever getting bored"
8029,heh god time and designing paradise...
8030,"There are many fascinating things about this game that I'm gonna get through them.
First, this game is open source, kinda. Anyone with the knowledge of programming can make a mod and this is the strong point for this game. Since it's a simulation game. Mods, assets, etc. 
Second, in respect to the first, is the workshop. There are many modders and creators that improve the gaming experience. There are mods that change the game into an engineering software. 
Third, this is for rich and poor at the same time. You kind of need a powerful device with a powerful CPU. In the other hand, this game downloads 20 MB of update and patches 5 GB of the game. I mean, pros and cons! 
There are some disadvantages that can be ignored for the reasons I'll tell. This game has no optimization. The graphics, the original graphics of the game, doesn't require a powerful GPU. Yet, you are gonna need a good CPU 'cause of the amount of particles. This can be ignored since there is a very good mod called FPS Booster that'll do the job.
You are gonna need to but the dlcs, many many dlcs. This can't be ignored but you can buy the DLCs at sales. And they are kinda cheap. So, thank you publisher!

I've spent many hours. Using my creativity and imagination to design a city. Used my brain to solve the problems you WILL encounter."
8031,very good game very nice and good looking for the price its a good game for managing your own city!

8046,"Kinda fun, water physics are balls though. Fun if you want to design your city on your own terms"
8047,"If you like city builders, this is best version of it. Some addons greatly improve the experience (Move It being a big one), and the DLCs expand the game in a big way."

8051,"It's great.

I don't like the Paradox multi-DLC's for years and years after, but they do actually add things to the game that are useful and I have bought a few of them, so I can't complain too much.

Once I get my city up and running to a decent degree I spend far too long just panning the camera around and watching things rather than actually playing the game though haha."
8052,"fun, but i can only play it for so long. it starts to become repetitive to just keep expanding and then dealing with the issues of expanding, and then expanding more."
8053,you can bulldoze peoples houses if they complain about taxes 10/10 would reduce the population again
8054,"If you like city building an traffic management, this is the game for you. This is everything a certain other city build could have been."
8055,"i like killing people on this game
"
8056,"This game has absolutely no challenge whats so ever, Its basically god mode. If you are looking for something to scratch your sim city itch this isn't it."
8057,A very relaxing change of pace from other titles. Love this game!
8058,good
8059,I have been playing this game for over 6 years and I love the fact it can easily become a hyperfixation over and over again for me. The gameplay is addictive and I love the growth of this game overall.
8060,This Game is a VERY Realistic Game About Citys If u like Money Managment This game is for u! u have to manage Where the people are at the Tax The Stores EVERY SINGLE THING Like a Real City!

8067,"Great game great mechanics.  The sandbox allows for total freedom to build without constraint.  This game has a huge modding community with tons a assets available.  There are rumors of a CSII on the horizon.  I for one, love this game.  One of the few games that does not require violence as a means to an end.  Keep it up.  GREAT GAME, GREAT COMMUNITY!"

8076,Great game and so immersive. I love it!!
8077,Fun game. 100x better with mods though. The mods give you so much more control over what you’re building
8078,"I love making cities
"
8079,"To me one of the best City Builders out there, the Vanilla base game is already good in terms the way you play it, the mechanics arent that different from most City games you play, though many parts of this game is very special in its way as in most games

the number of possibilities with the amount of mods, assets, and plugins are varied all depending on the user and the ideas you have about your city, it could be a great game for City Planners, Architects, Gamers such as yourself, there is no age requirement to the way you can play the game, in short its one of the best City Builders I have played yet"
8080,
8081,gud game
8082,"Good game, too much DLC for what feels like base game content. Get mods instead."
8083,"Best city builder out there.
Yes, there are many DLCs but you don't need them to enjoy this game. The Workshop is full with nice mods and assets such as buildings, highly recommended to go through the workshop after buying the game.

"
8084,"Can't I just say yes and not leave a description, what more do I need to say I love this game.
Modded and unmodded."
8085,ok
8086,A great game for people who like city simulations. The many available extra mods and assets allow for sheer endless customization. Warning - it's a time sink!

8088,I just like the building of city's. And Cities: Skyline is just perfect.
8089,"Very fun city building game, i like creating multiple cities and making them look cool"
8090,"If this game got a sequel that ran better, had fewer DLC that didn't make the experience feel like a confusing mess of conflicting systems, and expanded on its core systems (like traffic and weather) to fix their myriad bugs and inconsistencies, then maybe I would recommend that.

Unfortunately you get this instead. So no."
8091,Good game. Would reccomend. DLCs bit expensive tho. 9/10
8092,This game is what SimCity should have been.
8093,its fine
8094,Good game for not just entertainment but also learning how a city learn. Probably not perfectly accurate to real life situations but it can still give an idea of how.
8095,"I'm a very detail oriented guy, and this game is so detailed and in depth. It's well worth the occasional frustration in trying to find tiny errors in placements and layout, because when you find that error or make things worth how you want them to, it feels very rewarding. This game also allows you a form of test-bed for any city planning, whether that be irl or for a fictional project of some sort."
8096,fun game
8097,Highly addictive and very fun
8098,"This is a great game. Picks up where Sim City left off. What Sim City should have been. Great fun. Some minor annoyances here and there. The landscaping tool stinks, but you can figure it out eventually."

🌟 | Overall Rating: A

Brief Rating Overview:
Although many people may disagree with me, I believe this game is pretty good. The game lets you go beyond the limits you may think a game like this has. It offers a great experience with no DLCs or content packs and there is really never an end. The price is reasonable and goes on sale quite often.

8104,Amazing game. Fun to play to build cities or have fun building anythig.
8105,"Very fun city builder.  The various mods the community have made are outstanding and truly add to the game experience.  Note that this game does come with a lot of DLC, so the full game will be costly.  Some DLC are radio stations and are not necessary for game play.  Note also that some, but not all, mods will require access to some DLC.

8115,One of the best city builders on the market. Very detailed and very addictive. Needs a beefy pc to run but overall a very good game with lots of things to do.

Other than that, This game is beautiful, quality is good for average laptop. Couple suggestions though. Paradox should add a online game mod where players can create alliances and trade with others. Where other players citizens can visit others cities. A military would be cool as well. I don't know about war yet though. 9/10"

8191,yes
8192,"Good game, childhood game, dlc is a bit annoying but if it means there's still devs caring for the game then that's fine.

Also if it seems repetitive then that might mean one of two things:

1. You aren't that interested in city building games, or at least this one
2. You haven't tried to do bigger and more complex things in the game yet

Try to challenge yourself, don't be afraid to step into unmarked territory"
8193,You can build your own city. Quite fun!
8194,"Amazing game, love making cities! Although would reccomend at least 10gb of ram as my 8gb laptop sometimes crashes.

8195,"I am not a particularly smart man, but i don't understand why i have to agree to a EULA that lets paradox harvest my data to play a single player game. I could understand an anti-cheat method for a multiplayer game, or revenue for a free to play game, but this is neither. This is a single player game I've spent at least $60 on. Paradox is selling a paradox level of dlc for this game, do they really need to sell my data too?"
8196,it is good but  why so many DLCs?
8197,"What can I say?
After a long day this is the game to get in, and chill.
Unlike CS:GO where it's just Run-Gun-N-Blagan :(

Funny story I sold some skins so my son could go to college, I feel proud of myself
for not beating him down, imagine needing your father money for education smh jk Karen don't leave me again it was a joke O.o

Anyway I build cities now, great late night chill."
8198,"No doubt one of the best city builders, even if you were to go in with no DLC or just the starter pack you can still have a BLAST. It may be a bit hard to master with all the lane mathematics and proper design, it's definitely not a game that you can just mess about in (if you dont have mods that allow that). I wouldn't call the learning curve steep and any problems can be addressed by nitpicking and asking for help across the community."
8199,"Its a really chill game. If you want a game that you can just watch some youtube/netflix, do a little planning, enjoy your results...this is for you. Its just chill and rewarding"
8200,My favourite city building game. A must for fans of the genre.
8201,Too addicting had to force myself to get off of it.
8202,I am simply overjoyed with the satisfaction of sending apocalyptic sized meteors to destroy my citizens.
8203,I have this particular game for multiple platforms. Need to kill time and exercise your planning abilities? Use this it will either make you feel stupid or relatively intelligent when you see where you've created a problem and how to fix it.

8205,"This shit's pretty cool

8206,"Simply the best creative world and city building and management game. Play macro or micro, whatever you prefer. Great graphics and despite so much going on in your town, the game runs smoothly. Hundreds of hours easily from the base game, then thousands of mods to take that even further."
8207,Skip classes for this. That's how you know it's a good game
8208,good though some reason acheivements were disabled!
8209,Not that good on PC

8234,city's are build
8235,"it's fun! Make sure to give the workshop a visit though, base game is a great foundation but stuff made by the community is what makes this game worth it :))"
8236,"Great game, would reccomend."
8237,good game
8238,"If you like management type games and the idea of building cities from the ground up, this is a decent game. It is not fast pace, but it is nice to wind down with and just to relax."

8247,"workshop is a bit addicting, cant play game cuz of it. otherwise can make cool shapes out of roads"
8248,Splendid Game
8249,"Fantastic game, even after so many years 

Issue now is you're gonna have to play catch up and buy a load of DLCs to get the full experience

But it's becoming more noticeable that this game is showing it's age with performance issues on slightly lower end hardware

Some are speculating a new game is in development due to the slow down in DLCs and general needed optimizations needed nowadays

Get the game and dlcs if you have the money, wait for the next one and watch some building lets plays on youtube in other cases"
8250,Good game very fun very good very addictive
8251,Play this game if you want to learn how to build more efficient cities - it's great fun.
8252,good
8253,"I played on xbox for years, and I always loved it. Finally got it on Pc and already love it more. 
Looking at multiple guides on youtube and the such will help you in the start of the game. Always be planning out the future exstensions, use grids, and wait for money to build up when you can."
8254,this game hurts my head so much make it stop
8255,Make city
8256,It's very difficult to deal with traffic jams
8257,ok
8258,en jette bra spel
8259,"At the moment, it's the best game in the city building genre and the mods in the community workshop gives it even more depth. A perfect example is that I was so engrossed in a traffic problem at a particular intersection, customizing the lane connections and adjusting the timed traffic light, that I failed to notice that my main power plant had been disconnected from my city because of a lightning strike. This lead to a lack of water treatment and a subsequent mass exodus, 40k to 18k population and a massive budget problem. Thanks TM:PE :p

If you are price conscious, be patient. The game and the DLC will all eventually go on sale, historically to 75% off for the core game and 50% off for the major DLC. As of this review, the DLC that I own are Sunset Harbor, Campus, Industries, Parklife, Green Cities, Mass Transit, Snowfall, After Dark, and Concerts. I likely won't purchase Natural Disasters because it doesn't appeal to me but I will grab Airports during a sale."

8263,"whatever is on my mind right now, but i would recommend all of the human in this universe to play this game, it's awesome, amazing, and great especially it made with unity, so some of nice human being can mod it awesomely loike someone who are always walking down on the street every in the middle of night, and i will always love this game even if i just played it for 4 hours, but it's really awesome, i play this game while smoking cigarette it makes me feel so high, higher than my own idk whatever, nvm, but this game is really worth to buy even if it's 2022 it's still worth it, i belive this game will still be awesome till the end of this human universe will be exist, <3333333 and also whoever read my review i would really appreciate it and don't forget to add me as friend if you were lost in the middle of the forest okie ;3"

8271,"I've been eyeing this game for a LONG time, finally had the courage to buy it. I will say, I play on laptop, and it's not the smoothest running game. However, that'll probably change once I finish building my PC! Anyways, game's amazing and I don't regret a dime."
8272,"For those who enjoyed the Sim City games when they were younger, this is the game for you. With constant updates and a never-ending steam workshop the game never seems to get old. I would suggest having a pretty good PC to play this game. The AI and graphics will push most low end to mid level PCs to their breaking point (not including the 30 min loading time for large cities). All-in-all the best city builder thus far in gaming."
8273,"Fun Game.   Got started because a Youtuber ""Biffa"" went around fixing others city builds.  It's been a fun game to play ever since."

8282,"I came back to this game after 5+ years and play it a little less like a traffic simulator / city builder like I used to, and more to detail a tiny little city like a god. It's fun and doesn't really need any DLC when the modding community and content creator community is so active still."
8283,Great and engaging game.

8292,"Amazing Game, takes a while to learn but once you understand it its so much fun!"
8293,roundabouts
8294,"This game is addictive! There are a lot of expansion packs with this game, and so far every single one i've bought has been worth-while. I would suggest only buying one at a time to play around with the newly acquired expansion before purchasing another. give it 5-10 hours before going on to another expansion imo. I bought the parks expansion first, and i would recommend that one first as well. sunset harbor next and transit after that. The industries expansion is fairly expansive and does kind of make the game easier to play, so when you get that expansion, I would suggest enabling Hard mode from then on. Every time i buy a new expansion, i start a new city basically. Playing around with user created maps is really fun and the ability to mod your gameplay with user created mods is awesome. the Move-It mod is crucial for those OCD types that want everything to be perfectly aligned. :) Overall, I would recommend this game to anyone interested in city build type games for sure! I'm nearly 180 hours when writing this review and I do NOT see this game dying off anytime soon. Very happy with my purchases."

8308,"this platform is horrible. It crashes constantly. I am playing on a 2500 buck gaming system and everything plays perfect but steam. So no, I would not recommend."

8311,"Developer relies too much on modding community, countless features that should be already part of base game have to be integrated via mods. 

It would be fine if the developer wasnt asking 247€ for the whole package of DLCs.
"
8312,its more like EA they give u the game half naked and u gotta buy thousands of DLC packs to just feel that ur playing a full game such a shame but its fun beside that so if u wish t play the game only i wouldnt recommend it for u cus ur gonna get bored but if u buy the DLCS aswell then its fine but till aftera while ur gonna be like man what am i doing
8313,Awesome game to vibe in.

Atleast he doesnt play silly golf games like the others at his age. Risk is good! Risk is great! I buy Risk tokens!"

8323,"I've played Citystate before this, Skyline is a step-up to the game and it's nice,

I enjoy it because my city and country are going tho shit, poverty and inequality is increasing and i divulge myself into this game to make myself feel better by having some control over making people's lives better."
8324,"At this point, given I have nearly 150 hours into this game, I feel qualified now to give it a proper review. Keep in mind, I only own a couple of the major DLCs (After Dark, Park Life, and Industires) and a few of the Content Creator Packs.

Firstly, this game has something that's beyond unique. I mean, how many other games give you the opportunity to build a city from scratch and have control over a good portion of what happens in that city? Sim City comes close, and in some ways is superior to Cities: Skyline. However, the level of depth to which the mods are able to go is astonishing. Traffic management, changing spawn points for buildings to be more realistic, parking lot roads, and a whole host of wonderful mods. And the assets! My gosh! The assets that people make a simply astonishing.

However, the few things that do irk me about this game are few and far between, as you can see. My first biggest gripe is about how a lot of the more fun aspects of the game are behind DLCs. I know it's a sign of the times and that Paradox games are known for this. Paradox and Colossal Order do release some parts of the major DLCs to the broader game (most recently, the creator-made tree set). In addition, the leveling of the pads for buildings can often be tricky and cumbersome, so make sure to pay attention to landscaping for a majority of the assets like police departments, public libraries, as well as the majority of the zones. Most of them follow the topography of the land, and if you're not careful, you may end up with some pretty sharp drops just in front of your buildings or a sharp cutout behind the buildings.

That said, the most fun I've had with this game has been with the DLCs. Building uniquely shaped parks with a variety of amenities, from city parks to zoos to amusement parks. And most recently, I've enjoyed the more challenging aspect of the Industries DLC of trying to make sure everything can get where it needs to go and navigating the traffic problems that creates. The DLCs are integral parts of the game now, as are some mods. However, the mods are more quality of life improvements for me personally, so your mileage may vary as to how much of a perfectionist you are.

Like with most Paradox games there is a large community behind this game. Not only are there YouTubers who've dedicated a good portion of their channels to this game, but the asset makers are releasing DLCs for custom made work in tandem with Paradox. The Workshop content alone for this game shows just how much people adore and cherish it. And truthfully, so do I. I forsee myself spending a few more hundred hours in this game before I get bored, if not a thousand."

8343,"This game is very good for anyone wanting to build a simulated city. It is much better than sim city however we cannot discredit sim city as it was the first but, overall there is no issues i see with the game, no bugs or any other things however i would like to see multi use zoning such as having commercial on the bottom level and residential on the top."

8357,"[h1]I don't know if we should be rewarding this[/h1]
This is a reluctant recommendation.  Cities: Skylines is fun, but [b]only[/b] if you:
[list]
[*]Have at least 16 GB of RAM, and preferably 32 GB
[*]Are willing to read lots of third-party guides and watch some videos
[*]Are willing to spend a few hours researching, installing, configuring, troubleshooting, and learning a series of mods
[*]Are willing to put up with a non-trivial amount of jank and crashing, no matter what you do regarding the above
[*]Are willing to buy some of the DLC
[/list]
If you meet the above requirements, you can have fun in this game.
My progression was:
[olist]
[*]Get the game
[*]Realize that I'm going to need to buy some of the DLC
[*]Get very frustrated at confusing, tedious interface
[*]Discover mods
[*]Spend [i]hours and hours[/i] troubleshooting mods
[*]Try to play the game with mods
[*]Get frustrated at confusing, under-documented game mechanics
[*]Give up after fifty hours and write a negative Steam review
[*]Force myself to play some more
[*]Watch enough videos, read enough Reddit, talk to enough people on Discord that I start to understand things like industries and TM:PE
[*]Get a reasonably large city
[*]Begrudgingly come back to Steam and update review
[/olist]
Pros:
[list]
[*][b]Amazing[/b] modding community
[*]Game looks pretty nice
[*]I like that it tries to simulate so much of a city
[*]Lots of forms of transit (particularly with DLC)
[*]There's some really good, substantial DLC
[*]A 64-bit Mac game that actually works really well
[/list]
Cons:
[list]
[*]IMHO requires mods
[*]Initially you're going to spend far more time getting mods working than playing the game
[*]Game seems unstable:
[list]
[*]Saves fail sporadically and inexplicably
[*]Everyone warns you [i]never to exit to the main menu[/i] because this will make the game crash
[*]Indeed, much of the advice around mods is not to use various built-in game parts because they will crash
[/list]
[/list]
In fact, let me emphasize these last points with a few of the most popular mods right now:
[list]
[*]""Loading Screen Mod temporary"": reduces system requirements from two supercomputers to one; it's ""temporary"" because mods break often enough and the original author has stopped playing the game
[*]""Load Order Mod"": try to load your mods in order so that they don't crash
[*]""Compatibility Report"": writes very detailed compatibility notes for all of your mods at startup
[/list]
The point I'm trying to make is (1) the game needs so many mods that (2) modders have had to make mods to make the game work with mods.  Should the game really need all this, or is it indicative of another full-priced game being released just 75% complete?

I digress.  Let's get back to those cons:
[list]
[*]My brand new game takes like 17 GB of RAM?  Maybe I'm behind the times but people online saying ""you really need 32 GB to play this game"" seems [i]insane[/i]
[*]Game mechanics are under-documented and too hard to understand; things like industries don't work and you can't tell why without reading a dozen third-party tutorials (❤️)
[/list]
In the end, I've had a lot of fun with this game, but getting to this point has been very trying.  I wouldn't blame you if you go to some other building/management/logistics game.  But if you're willing to put up with the above, there is a fun game to be had here."
8358,kept crashing but i think its a good game to get
8359,"Wait, you mean there's life outside of this game?"
8360,"Great fun city builder. Way better than Sim City. I've spent so many hours on this game, both on PC and XBOX. Love the community content which allows for so much replayability. 
Expect this game to have a serious negative impact on your sleep though.. you will not be able to stop playing and there's always the situation of ""just gonna fix this one more thing, then I WILL go to bed!"", and three hours later you're still playing. 
Highly recommended though. Unlimited replayability."

8445,"Personally, at the beginning this game had been very understanding. That's what I really loved about it, it just made sense. I'd totally recommend this to others, it gives you an enjoyable time on a game that gives the most of fun. Get it now, it's worth it."
8446,"Incredibly Addicting. Traffic management is pain, but can be made easier with the throusands of useful Workshop Items.
The only thing that is slightly annoying is the amount of money required to get the ""full"" experience with all DLCs. I own 15 out of ~30 DLCs and if I want to buy all the remaining ones I'd have to pay over 100€ just for the DLCs..."
8447,Its pretty good.
8448,It is game
8449,nice game
8450,The ultimate city builder. Timeless classic already.
8451,"great game, only if it could be expanded more tiles and elements, PCs these days can easily handle it"

8453,"Cities: Skylines is one of those games where I pick it up for hours upon hours, and then don't touch for months or even a year. However, that has changed as of late. This is one of my favorite games to play to just relax, no stress, no sweaty enemies, just me, my city, and a podcast or movie in the background.

As of recently, I have purchased the rest of the DLC, giving me even more to play around with, specifically Airports and Campus. I also have a bunch of new maps to try and get a population of over 100k on.

Definitely worth the investment ($30 base game) if simulation and city builders are your type. It's hard to believe this game is almost 7 years old at this point.

Pros:
-Endless customization
-Fun replayability
-Sandbox
-Constant support from Dev/Community

Cons:
-No tutorial
-Performance can start to get a little hairy as your city grows (and I have a 3090)
-Game appears to be CPU intensive"

8480,"Best city builder game, I just wish the DLC was cheaper. You can still have a lot of fun with just the main game and 2-3 DLC though."
8481,"Growing up, I played PC games like Roller Coaster and Zoo Tycoon. Never played the SIMS or any other city building game, and for most of my life I've been playing console based games like CoD or FIFA. But I have to say, this game is absolutely incredible. I find myself being drawn back to this game over and over. The maps are amazing, the city building and planning aspect of the game is always changing. And the best part is as you grow and as you get better at the game, your city planning evolves, becomes better, and you start to make really amazing cities. I have 75 hours into the game so far and I still feel like a beginner. There's so much to this game and with all of the amazing community packs, mods, and DLC, there is literally no way that this game will ever become stale or boring."
8482,great game

8489,"Personal distaste for the game itself. 
Call me old school, but this game just is not fun. 
Playing creative or not, the feeling of something always missing. 
Almost no control of what buildings are built in zones. Always trying to fix traffic, etc.
It's likely I'm not playing the game to its full potential, but so much feels missing.
""DLC everything"""
8490,"there is nothing worse for a returning player trying to play the game again after a few years, than seeing there have been 30 dlcs released since last time you played

I instantly loose all interest playing the game again

and since its paradox, with its toxic paradox dlc design... almost none of those 30 fcking dlcs can be skipped"
8491,Addicted
8492,"This game is quite expensive for the content you're given.
If you want to have some of the cooler tools of this game you'd need to spend even more money to achieve them.
I mean I get it, but 27,99€ for only that many tools?
Too many DLCs. They turned me away from the game"

8516,"I'm just sad what has been done to this game. I took a break from it for roughly 3 years and recently wanted to get back into it. The amount of ""necessary"" DLCs is frustrating and the changes to an external launcher, with an EULA that states they are practically allowed to sell your personal information is very alarming.

awesome game"
8539,its good but all the DLC are too expensive
8540,"It's Sim City on steroids. Very addictive. Recommend watching some Youtube tutorials first before getting into the game. Save your money in the beginning of a new city and slowly expand. Don't get every DLC. Start with a few and get comfortable using them, then add more later. They're cheap and often on sale anyway."
8541,"its ight



Update: its quite literally the best game of all time. Cities skylines is in my blood, i watch it on youtube, i listen to it on spotify, i breath cities skylines, the water i eat and the food i drink is cities skylines"
8542,It's pretty good.
8543,"A lot of fun for anyone that is creative but also slightly controlling. This game brings strategy and creativity together in the  best way. I would recommend this game to my friends who are of the same mindset as I am. My all time favorite game, I love it!"

8552,"   If you are a ""SimCity"" fan, this game will be tricky at first but once you are able to pull away from most of the rules of that game. This game is just as good as it is a little more detailed in areas."
8553,"On its own its a good game. Has some good basics for city building. The DLCs definitely make it better though. Currently playing with green cities, mass transit (must have), and industries and i like what they have to offer. I especially love that i can cut down on pollution with green cities. One thing i wish it had was placable sound barriers that you can place like you would a road or path. Maybe theres one in the workshop but i wish it was part of the base game. When you drive into a big city and you go past the residential areas right up on the freeway they always have big concrete sound barriers and i always have people complaining of noise pollution in my games. Im pretty bad at reviews but i would recommend this game if you enjoyed the older sim city games. I played SC4 for a little while before remembering i had this game. Would also recommend if you just generally enjoy a good city building game. I think it does a good job being a city building sim. Excited to pick up the other DLCs and play more of the game when i can."
8554,"If layout design is your thing, this is the game for you. So much creativity to be had from playing Cities: Skylines; A day can easily fly by engaging in it."
8555,"I've got 382 hours into this game over the years now, and I still cannot stop messing around with it. I don't view this as a ""game"", but more of a simulator for those who are stimulated by control/input. The game is long in the tooth at this point on the back end, but on a decent gaming PC it still looks great. It's super taxing on the CPU regardless of the graphics levels. I started playing this one a pretty bare bones business grade X1 Carbon laptop, and it could run it all day with minimal add-ons and in vanilla/low settings. It sure did get hot though. I've since upgraded to a Legion 7S with Ryzen 7 5800H and 3060, and it just crushes this game on the highest settings + add-ons and city scale.

I look forward to Colossal's next stab at this, since with more modern dev work on the engine, it will only get more creative and expansive. Would love to see more interaction around outside connections, like trade, diplomacy, etc. I also would like to see a really sophisticated solution to population logic - there are mods that help with this but it still doesn't feel ""real"". My large city should have more than 50k residents, for example. DLC around regional themes would be nice. For example, being able to buy a $5 USA theme that keeps your cities architecture completely in line with that you'd see in the USA, or other places. You can definitely get close to it, but there are some weird looking assets that grow regardless."
8556,"even without mods or dlcs (i havent bought any yet), this game is awesome. the amount of stuff you can create and do is amazing, it never gets old. highly recommend"
8557,
8558,okok
8559,"It's fun to pretend, that know what you are doing and have a plan. Base game is Ok, DLC makes it Good, but mods make it 
B-E-A-U-tiful."
8560,"Probably the yardstick city builder these days, the infrastructure requirements aren't nearly as finicky as some others (don't need power lines so long as developed property can connect through to the power stations, for example, and a single water line services an 'area' without needing individual connections.  Very pretty.  Loads of DLC for it that I haven't gotten around to, and I still find myself coming back for some zen city building."
8561,Uh it gud and it fun when ur bored and it gud and yeahhhhhhh and it is nice brek from reality

8568,"Engaging, better than SimCity."
8569,"Overall a good experience playing with mods (the community is amazing), but I'd recommend researching a bit before buying to make sure it's exactly what you want and whether the vanilla gameplay is enough."
8570,yes
8571,Not enough workers
8572,great
8573,"best city builder game by far
"
8574,"I've been playing Cities Skylines for 5 years now and honestly it's my favorite game ever. I grew up playing Sim City and later Minecraft (Creative mode) building cities. But Cities Skylines is much more than that. There are hundreds op options within the game, as tens of different policies you can apply to districts you created yourself. Transportation is also really cool. It's a traffic-managing, public transport and roads/networks builder too. 

The best in my opinion is the huge community behind the game. The YouTube channels, WiKi's and forums are sooo nice and full of inspiration. Everyone can create usefull mods and amazing assets and share them easily on the workshop. It's an open and free evironment where you can find literaly everything you imagine, as eally specific mods, buildings, maps orutilities from everywhere in the world.

Avoid at all costs, they still haven't even fixed the death wave issue that's been in the game since it was released."

8589,Very very fun!!
8590,"Fun to play, not too much pressure. The game looks great."
8591,Very fun and very deep. Lot's of replay-ability. Lots of additional content. Cool mods. Free and paid stuff. Virtually no limit to the complexity of this sim. To enjoy this game you probably should like simulations. That's the caveat.

8612,"Its fun, Hard to understand and pretty overwhelming at first. But after watching some tutorials and stuff, I like it 
"
8613,Cities: Skylines is one of the [ really? a traffic jam again on that exit? I just fixed that ] best city builder out there. Mainly because [ I should have never polluted that area near the river ] is offers you so many different approaches and game modes when building your city. My favorite [ I cannot believe we are running out of oil and we will need to import it ] game mode is playing the vanilla mode which will inevitably create you some problems which will have to be handled later once your city is bigger. I will stop this review now cause I have just found the perfect place for that Airport I was about to build. Thanks for reading.
8614,"Great, DlCs a bit expensive"
8615,"While having only 121 Hours played in this game compared to the other people with 1,000+ hours, I can positively say that this game is the best you'll get if you want a city building game. The coding and AI is absolutely amazing, the base game content is also more than sufficient without DLC's or (some) Mods. In City Skylines, we can see Infrastructure, a deeply-detailed game and system. While also being able to be fun and inspire creativity.

8623,"The standalone game is not bad in any way, it's good, but a bit mid. However, the greatest features that C:S has are the mods from the Steam Workshop, the mods elevate this game's level from a 7/10 to a 9/10. Pick up mods to play C:S. The vanilla game is not necessarily boring but rather less enjoyable.

C:S can go from a strategy city builder game to a sandbox game depending on the way you enjoy the most to play. C:S is divided by milestones and each milestone unlocks new resources. C:S does also have classic elements for any city builder, as every city has needs that must be managed and provided and has a very long playtime due to the size of the map. You begin in a small square but later on you'll unlock more areas and the map becomes large late-game (limit is 9 squares, 25 with mods). If you prefer a sandbox city builder, C:S comes with an infinite money and unlock all buildings mods so you can build the city the way you want without worrying about milestones nor money. The most enjoyable way depends on your own play style.

One cronic problem C:S has is that cities very often suffer from gigantic traffic issues, due to the way the traffic AI is programmed, the AI doesn't have the best programming as cars tend to pile in one single lane regardless of how many lanes there are. Cars totally don't drive like the real world, that provided, gridlocks are very common to happen if nothing is done, and the mod Traffic Manager: President Edition is a must-have mod to manage traffic and try to prevent your city from becoming a traffic pandemonium. As well, it's very easy to unbalance the RCI demand gauges and the game ner mentions this problem, when it happens your city reaches a deadend and you'll run into a city with no demand for anything unless you are able to revert this state.

The thing the makes C:S great is the mod support from the Steam Workshop. C:S has a great and active modding community, with hundreds of modders. There are hundreds of mods in the Workshop to enhance your playing experience and to fix many of C:S's core problems. There are also thousands of assets to customize your city. Mods in C:S range from fix mods,  traffic manage mods, more roads mods, road building precision mods, anarchy mods (allowing you to avoid the game's restrictions for building), node moving mods and more. Assets range from buildings, houses, stores, skyscrapers, castles, stations, schools, universities, portals, signs, street lights, traffic lights, parks, and much more, the possibilities are endless. The vanilla game tends to get boring overtime, but the variety of mods provides an improvement to the replay value and greatly increases the potential play-time in a same city.

The game with mods is a blast. Building cities, planning roads, neighborhoods, freeways and growing your cities is insanely satisfying. There is no cap for your creativity.

I totally recommend going for C:S, and be sure to play with mods and custom assets of your choice, it's very easy do download them from the web browser and the in-game browser. This doesn't mean I don't recommend vanilla C:S, I also do, but less due to the aforementioned issues. And why would anyone play vanilla while having mods available? Unless if it's a challenge, preference or something similar.

Without mods: 7/10
With mods: 9/10"

8702,This game's achievements are completely inappropriate for my son! It said the Bum word.
8703,: )
8704,"Absolutely love this game.  Its like SimCity on crack.  With added mods, and consistent updates the game is always growing and changing.  Start with the base game, get some time played in, then start adding expacks and mods slowly or it can be overwhelming.  Each expack adds more detail and more control to your city so adding one at a time is more doable.   I highly recommend for anyone who likes city building, micromanaging, and overall designing."
8705,"What SimCity should have been.  Also the modding community is amazing, thank you modders!"
8706,me likey
8707,"I have owned this game since before the DLC, And it's really a great game. But I simply cannot recommend it because of the typical Paradox model of releasing what would normally be free update as 15$ DLC that never goes on sale."
8708,Traffic/Vehicle AI is not perfect but it's a fun game!

8729,Beeest game eveerrrr
8730,Best game for building cities
8731,"Great game!. Amazing graphics and well built. It is a game I could play for hours and improve the skill of finance management. 
It does have its drawbacks that I find the game gets corrupted very easily and far too often.
I do have the PS4 version, but unfortunately, there are no MOD capabilities yet, so its extremely limited."
8732,Its the best city builder at the moment. Modern Day Simcity.
8733,"Cities: Skylines is a very fun game which is, unsurprisingly, a game about building a city. There is modding support and you can make your own assets right in the game. There are many things to consider while designing a city and this game takes almost all of them into account, you need to build residential, commercial, and industrial areas according to how much your population needs them and there are many different ways to provide other services. You unlock better things and more land as you get a larger population, but you also get more things to manage. Eventually you can obtain, process, and sell goods such as oil, metal, wood, and food as well as terraform the land. There is water physics so you can make a nice plowing river. There is also polluted water so you can make a lake full of garbage and make people like around it. Overall, I think this game is quite good and I rate it 9 garbage lakes out of 10."
8734,love it
8735,"Started this one when it first came out, then sort of lost interest pretty quickly. Came back a bunch of years later and WOW... the zen game of my dreams. No time to leave any more feedback, as I must go build more highways..."
8736,Fab
8737,is fun
8738,"Beautiful and addictive city builder. Watching your city from the ground level, with your inhabitants commuting to work etc is a beautiful experience."

Fell in love when i first saw this game."
8740,"a dead person was waiting for their transport

on a trampoline..."
8741,yes
8742,"Just wished it was more optimized for newer systems.Adding mods makes the game a lot better. Otherwise its a good game. 5600x, 3070ti, 32gb ram, 1TB NVME."
8743,Abandoned building bulldozer simulator
8744,"extremely heavy on graphics and low fps and can regularly error or crash specially on a low end device or lots of mods , but if you do make it past that it can be an excellent city builder..."
8745,Traffic Jam simulator
8746,"managed to get my third city attempt to 'big city'
then decided to build a river dam on top of two tiny artificially terraformed hills to get that sweet a** electricity
river flooded and spilled everywhere
city is now atlantis
10/10 would swim with the fishes again"
8747,Addicting as hell.
8748,"I like to build virtual cities instead of building some kind of life for myself outside of video games. I mean, I could've had a career by now to make my family proud but I just play this instead. Most of my peers are either married, or about to be married but I just wanna keep building more cities to escape the pain and misery of human existence."

8829,it's an awesome game
8830,yay!
8831,one of the best simulation games.  New content and updates are always available.
8832,"A fantastically complex game, that will take HOURS and HOURS of your time and enjoyment. The DLCs give so much more to the experience, especially, ""Park Life"", ""Industry"", and ""Campus"". BUT, do NOT start with the DLCs....be sure to ONLY use only the vanilla version until you learn, as the DLCs do alter the play style a good bit. BUT, once you learn the basics, they are definitely a blast, and add a lot of fun to the sim. 

If you've played SimCity, and enjoyed it, then this is the REAL ""simulation"" style of that particular ""game"", I would say, and you will LOVE this one. Just don't give up on it too quickly!"
8833,very fun
8834,"If you like strategy games and a relatively realistic simulation of population life, economics, traffic and scenery, this is it.  This game sprung from the inspiration of SimCity but puts significantly fewer limitations on your imagination.  There are many DLCs that allow you to include those appearances and functionalities you would like your city to have, and adding DLCs, creator packs, assets and mods over time from the Steam Workshop and Steam Store keeps it ever fresh.  It's not for everybody but it is a great game experience that lets you build what interests you in an interesting way.  Warning: Resist the temptation to spend all or your time in the cities you create...."

8853,"You get to build a city and its fun.








Don't play this game if you don't want to get addicted."
8854,"gud gaem, build city life good"
8855,"Featuring a garbage business model rivalling any game of Sims and only made playable with mods and tutorials, I can really only say yes to buying this game on a discount.

At its core, C.S is a game of optimal road placement.

DLCs are not at all what they are often assumed to be, a transport DLC wont provide all forms of transport, little bits of transport features will be seeded in with the other DLCs, and just about all of them do this, thus making the only way you can get all the content you want buying a DLC you have little or no interest in.

The base game plays really quite well on its own, but there's a lot to be said for releasing a game complete than milking your customer base with what amounts to macrotransactions for next to nothing in return.

A lot of mods that do offer what you may desire tend to rely on the base DLCs to run.
Want a helicopter in the game?
Does the mod provide a helicopter?
Yes! But.. 

Why I made this review positive is because it is actually an enjoyable game, but I'd never recommend the developer even to a prospective date."

8893,"The Mayor of Bluffington sat in his plush, diamond-coated, leather recliner chair, pleased with the work he had done. He had spent the entire city's budget on money-saving dirt roads that meandered effortlessly throughout the landscape, with twists and turns to make the most perilous of rollercoasters blush.

Wind turbines were placed in the most opportune of locations and the Mayor was sure that the residents, who had yet to move in, would love it.

Each road was situated perfectly and the city was full of zones waiting to be fulfilled.

As the months flew by, more and more residents moved in, admiring the intricate roads and abundant energy provided by the wind turbines.

Unfortunately, this is where things take a turn for the worse (and noticeably smellier).

The Mayor of Bluffington had, once again, neglected to connect their sewage pipe to the city's drainage system and the entire budget had been spent. No banks were offering loans and, as a result, the residents suffered. Oh did they suffer...

The only commercial building that had been occupied, and was providing a taxable income, was the clothes factory.

But now, with the sewage backing up to astronomical proportions, even the clothes factory had quickly become abandoned, decrepit, and filled to the brim with sewage. Realising what they had done (or not done...), the Mayor of Bluffington frantically fiddled with budget sliders and attempted road removals in hope of a refund. Sadly, this was all in vain and the residents continued to pump out sewage at an exponential rate.

The Mayor of Bluffington, reluctantly, conceded defeat, and vowed that next time, he would remember to place that one piece of pipe that could have made all the difference. He adorned the only jacket that the clothes factory had produced in time, pulled up his oversized angling waders (complete with easy-access flap), and waded through the sewage that had built up in his office, to the next city that would receive his (not so) Midas touch.


In conclusion, if you're looking for a great city generator set in a period of sewage and power problems, this is the game for you. 

You can figure out for yourself if you like the graphics and audio or not, I have no problems with either. If you won't be installing a bunch of awesome mods, be prepared for a less fun time (if you don't install the Traffic Manager mod, are you really playing?).

Plus, the AI loves to avoid your hugely invested in parks, so be prepared to quickly change your entire strategy for providing entertainment. Don't worry, you'll complete the ambitious road project and be able to build that fire station by the fire at the clothes shop before you run out of cash...you did remember to build fire stations, right?

8919,"TLDR: you can build good enough looking cities (youtube is the proof), but it will definitelly take more of your time then you think, will require heavy modding (and tinkering and troubleshooting and pixel pushing) and pretty much all DLC's... and it probably won't be near as much fun as you think. At least that was my experience. Hope this helps someone save his 100 hrs... :)

Review:
Tried to like it, but I don't... Maybe it's just not for me....

So far I've played over 100 hrs, but when I look back, 2 words come to my mind - BORING and CHORE. 

Basically, the game is about reaching population checkpoints that unlock new buildings and fulfilling 3 basic needs (housing, commercial, industry) and a basic routine looks like:
- put down some roads
- drag a rectangle to mark residential areas
- drag a rectangle to mark industrial areas
- drag a rectangle to mark commercial areas
- place school building, landfill, cemetery, police and hospital within reach.
- wait until people move in and start working 
- REPEAT until you reach next population checkpoint... and again, and again...

Also, occasionally you need to:
- troubleshoot trafic
- place industry buildings (if you bought DLC's)
- place a few other special buildings

My problem with CS is also that it just doesn't look very visualy appealing and most of the stuff that you can see built on the internet requires a heavily moded game - which then causes incompatibility issues and errors.. I don't think I have too many mods (mostly just influencer recommended and top rated), yet I can't even reload a save ingame without an error...

Also, you need a DLC or a mod for what I think is basic stuff that should be included in basic game - making the basic game feel useless and bland without DLCs. Although I have the same feelings about it with DLC's... IIt's just a little bit better. For example:
- bike lanes - a normal thing for most cities - but in CS you need to buy DLC 
- want trams? - another basic thing that requires DLC
- airports?
- want more flavour to your industrial zones then just draging a rectangle and waiting for random buildings to grow? - more DLCs
- without DLC's it's just a game about dragging rectangles to mark zones - I think they should be base game as they are essential to enjoying the game even a little... 

There are also problems with the game that just shouldn't be there - especially in a game with such a price tag (considering it incomplete without DLCs)
for example:

- I  placed train/monorail/metro station and it couldn't accept intercity trains (it was a base game station on a base game map.. yet it didn't work

- forget building nice roads without mods - base game only allows you to use very basic and limiting angles for your roads, which don't look natural at all. For smoother connections, you will need a mod (anarchy)- however by itself it makes roads look generaly uglier then before (artifacts, missing textures, etc), so you need another mod to fix that. Once your nodes are fixed, you are left with blank unappealing connections without road markings - and you need yet another mod to fix that... what I am getting at is that the ability to construct good roads should be part of a base game, not relying on external mods... And all that tinkering means that you will spend just too much time trying to place and adjust a good enough looking road - something that should be simple and easy. 
When I know how I want my road to look, I should just be able to simply place it and be done with it (not having to mod it and spend an hour trying to bend it and smooth it into desired shape - that should have been taken care of automatically)

- Day/night cycle is useless - at night it's basically too dark to do anything, so eventually I ended up turning it off as it gets boring and in the way pretty soon...

- Trafic logic is sometimes terrible - you can build a good and optimalized road connections and for some reason the cars will decide not to utilize other 2 empty lanes, but create a long one lane trafic jam instead of getting to their destination quicker... or they decide to switch lanes when they could have continued on (and block trafic in the progress). There is a mod to improve trafic, but then it can get pretty tedious having to force trafic in certain ways and it can cause more problems down the line

- the way the game places assets - if your terrain is not completely level (which is not the case in reality), the game will sort of flatten it, but in a weird way - often making your parking lots and other flat assets look wavy and silly. For buildings on uneven terain it creates an ugly ledge to sit on (and making the parking lots wavy as well..). 
 
- and so many other problems, but it's getting too long.…

8920,My cities are ugly but the games still great.
8921,👍
8922,"Where has my life gone!  Over 1k hours!  So many Cities, so many things learned.   Yes, it has issues, but all games do.  Mods help for sure.  Requires a beast PC to run perfect when you approach 80k pop."
8923,"played a lot of this game, love this game.
the workshop is incredible and very addictive.  i have brock this game many times by using hundreds of mods and assets from the workshop. there are a lot of DLCś and its annoying, as much as i love this game it's not work much more than the base game to me. other then that highly recommend it. but also be very careful. the workshop will emotionally damage you"
8924, I have played many hours of this game and have to say it is one of the best city builders ever.
8925,"very good chill game I would not buy it at the full price though wait for a sale you can get it for 7 bucks 
"
8926,This game is really nice to play and to have other friend playing as well. When i call my friends they stream their cities and we all play even though there is no multiplayer. Highly recomend
8927,"good fun, gotta use traffic mods, obviously not perfect but hey its fun, works well enough. Could use more content and detail but it is what it is. I like it. Gotten my money's worth."
8928,"The best city builder out there. There is nothing that compares to this, get some DLCs and you will have an amazing experience. The mechanics are all fairly in-depth and the game looks and plays well. A must-buy for anyone interested in the city building genre. The game does have quite a large DLC policy though, so make sure to get the game and all DLCs when they're on sale."
8929,Base game is kind of boring but if you get mods it becomes a lot better
8930,I built a city it was fun i liked 10/10
8931,"Among city-building sims I've played, this is definitely one of my favourites. My only pet peeve is that the tweets can get pretty annoying after a while, like the one complaining that I allocated an industrial zone to farmland. Like, I get it, you don't like farms, but whining about it won't make me change it. That being said, I actually do like that there are people complaining about stuff. For the next game, I hope they go deeper on this topic so that I also have to do more to please my constituents than build parks ever 50 squares and make sure they have water and electricity.  Maybe I haven't gotten deep enough into the game, but a single-tweet isn't going to be enough to get my greedy hands off that dirty oil money.

"
8932,yes
8933,"The more I learn, the more fun I have. There are a few things that bug me, but that's mostly because I haven't figured it out yet. The game could use a more extensive tutorial, but otherwise, I can't find anything I dislike about the game.  I've also been picking up DLC a bit at a time and check the workshop often for good mods (and there's a ton of them.)  this game might not be what RTS wargamers and FPS players are looking for, but it's a solid city builder which I would take over Sim City any day."
8934,awesome!
8935,"This game is currently one of the best city builders available on Steam; the community that surrounds this game alone is amazing and the amount of creative people that post stuff on the workshop every single day is awesome, but I do have some problems with it. For one, this game has the same problem that all other Paradox games have; WAY too much DLC, and some of the DLC is literally pointless, like really? Concerts DLC? It should have been free like the Match Day DLC, along with the Snowfall DLC, which was extremely disappointing. You can only experience snow on certain maps, the DLC should have added dynamic weather to the game. 

Another problem I have is the performance chugging later in the game, I have a pretty beefy computer and even then, the way the game performs later on when you have a lot of citizens is pretty abysmal (thankfully there are some mods that can remedy this). There is also a thing I find really annoying is Colossal and Paradox sort of depending on the workshop instead of just adding certain features into the game themselves. It's great that they support the creators on the workshop and give them plenty of love and attention, but it feels extremely lazy not to implement certain things themselves.

Besides all of the things I mentioned above, this game is amazing, especially compared to the likes of the latest SimCity game; you have WAY more land to work with in this game, road placement feels nice, the terraforming system is pretty well thought out and it's awesome to see your city come to life. Pick this game up if you are in anyway interested in city building/civil engineering, especially at the time of writing this review. The game is currently on sale along with all of its DLCs."

Review by Unam 

Ever since I was a kid, I've always dreamed of creating a big city and managing every detail, with Cities: Skylines you can get as close as possible to that dream. The amount of detail and customization in the game is insane, everything you do counts toward making an impact on your city, from planting a small tree to overhauling your highway. It's also crazy how you can literally pick a random person and follow them through an entire day through their life, and you can do this for the thousands of people in your city, absolutely insane.

At first, starting a town can be sort of hard, because the player may need to plan ahead to the future while maintaining the current population happy, and when your town keeps growing you're going to have to look back at your town and solve problems that you didn't have when you started. This level of challenge is what keeps the player motivated to keep expanding instead of keeping what they have.

If there is only one slight issue I have, which is not necessarily the game's fault is the amount of paid DLC that paradox is offering. I understand that extra content is always a good thing, but part of me thinks some of this stuff could have just been a free update to the game. 

Still, Cities: Skylines is an incredible sim that will push you to your absolute limits.

I give Cities: Skylines a...

8964,Great game
8965,Hours fretting about traffic flow - very theraputic. 10/10
8966,"Cities: Skylines is a good game. I'm not the first person to talk about why it was so much better than simcity so I won't go into detail about the pros of this game. Instead I would like to touch on something that I feel not many people mention with regards to the game's complexity.

This game simply does not provide a relaxing, mindless experience of city simulation. Someone described it as a ""glorified traffic simulator"" and I think that fits the bill pretty well. There's just so much city management and traffic management of various types that the game requires immense planning just to have something that looks and functions decently. In any of the older simcity games, you could just make grids and more or less be fine. You could place necessities relatively close to each other and let the city be. While some may find an extremely customizable and detailed-oriented experience to be their taste, I personally feel that this game can get too overwhelming at times. And yes, I know there are mods out there and other options to make the game easier, but it almost feels like I'm less of a player for not indulging in all of the micromanaging aspects. This becomes especially clear when you watch youtubers play the game, realizing that they're so much better at planning out and handling all of the various elements of a city than you are. Cities: Skylines basically has all of the internal expectations and pressures of being on instagram."

8983,"I would like to recommend this game however I can't. The game is extremely buggy as I spent 2 days making a city just for a train line to appear out of no where going across my city and I couldn't demolish it and I hadn't even placed a single train station anywhere (I was playing with 0 mods and a few DLCs).
It would be a fun game however it is just a waste of time spending days making a city for it to bug and break it.

Edit: This game is also memory-leakville."

9004,Game go hard
9005,its pretty good
9006,"This is the best city builder on the market. You can mod it to your hearts content and there are nearly endless mods. The game is relaxing while still being detailed. If you like to watch TV or listen to podcasts or audio books while playing games this is a great one as well. Unlike some other city builders you don't usually end up in force fail scenarios.

9041,"amazing, very addictive and fun :D the best city building game out there. however, game needs a bit of optimization, load times are long, especially with many mods installed."
9042,"It's expensive on paper... But remember there are LOTS of free assets, roads, buildings, mods etc availble free for the base game.

I found myself quickly buying all the DLC as it did add value for me. It's really quite a facinating game. with a lot of realistic depth. There is something here for everyone.... traffic management is fun / challenging. It's like a huge city puzzle game with AMAZING visuals... Highly recommended if you can get your head around the cost."
9043,"Probably the best city builder on the market right now, especially considering the extensive mod support.

There's certain things I wish the game would fix:
[olist]
[*] The game design has gotten somewhat messy with all the DLC, the addition of industry/campus/whatever districts with manually placed buildings doesn't fit that well with the original design based around zoning.
[*] Similarly, some features, like bike lanes, were added in DLC, then never expanded upon. There's no way to control where cyclists can go in crossings, no way to add traffic lights for them, etc.; you can't do any of this even with mods, which makes bike lines very much a ""plop it down and forget about it"" thing.
[*] There's also just generally relatively little support for controlling pedestrians; building pedestrian paths is a bit of a pain, and there's relatively little offered in the way of customizing where they can go, with lights or signs.
[*] The AI is kind of limited in some aspects, which is made all the more obvious by mods that fix it. Why garbage trucks decide it's a good idea to go all the way to the other end of the city, or warehouses just decide to use all their trucks for exports, is a bit of a mystery... The train AI is especially terrible, it becomes very difficult to control trains for a bigger city with a lot of cargo hubs, especially if you disable the magical despawning that's in the game by default, to prevent vehicles getting stuck for too long.
[*] There's little support for newer graphical technologies just because of the game's age. Mods add in some things like different AA methods, but don't expect support for raytracing or anything.
[/olist]

Overall, I'm hoping the devs are working on Cities Skylines 2, where they can integrate some of the features they added only in DLC later on, as core mechanics of the main game. It would also be nice if they integrated some advanced features currently only provided by mods, to allow for more detailed control over construction or traffic; I realize this kind of depth is not for everyone, but I'd rather have it be part of the main game than have to rely on mods for everything; it really does add a ton of longevity to the game when you can get into all the tiny details the vanilla game just doesn't allow you to do."
9044,This game is one of the best games I've ever played.
9045,"No warning, I got hit by a Tsunami in the middle of flat dry Kansas on my second map. My population went from 20k to 5k. All the buildings were destroyed and the city went bankrupt within 1 day. 10/10

170 Hours = I deleted this city

171 Hours = I watched some YT tutorials about public transit

172 - 190 Hours = I practiced all modules in Cities: Skylines (road hierarchy, traffic manager mod, road  layout, public transit, traffic occuring in industrial districs, district politics ...)

191 Hours = I started a new city

200 Hours = The city grows and there are no traffic jams, or if trafic jams occur I could fix them

205 Hours = I absolutly love my city and there are no traffic jams at all!

And now I can´t stop playing this game.

So what can you expect, when you want to play Cities: Skylines?

Pain and frustation... if you don´t know what you are doing and how to handle issues in your city.
You will watch 100 of hours of YT tutorials to learn all what you nedd to fix problems in your city.
You will need mods for a more comfortable gameplay and assets for a much more beautyful city.

BUT... if you managed to analyse the problems in your city and know how to fix them... you will be addicted with playing Cities: Skylines and you will play only 1 city for hours and hours.

I can absolutely recommend this masterpice of an game!!!

but... it must be nice"
9102,"What can I say, this has been the most comprehensive city builder/simulation I've played to date. Not only does this game have real city metrics and very interesting traffic AI but the mod community is fantastic! It makes is possible to build real world cities with 1:1 scale assets creating unique narratives. Enhancing content with the DLCs is probably my top recommendation, as it adds challenges to controlling a live functioning city responding to threads, taking care of resources and balancing financials."

9116,"where to begin, excellent game well worth the money and fun, until I was playing and the whole game turned into a steaming pile of garbage, for some strange reason I believe that there is a bug that causes the need for residential commercial and office space to go to zero and stay there. I used to play on origin never had a problem the reason I came to steam was because they stopped carrying the expansions, it may have something to do with the mods, I was using

9154,"It's a great game. IF IT WORKED. Since the release of the Aiprort DLC a new update came out which broke every single mod, multiple new bugs and constant crashes, purposefully broken mods to make you pay for the content that was free before. Optimization of this game is a hotdog on a plate, it's nothing special but it's good enough, with the latest updates the plate was smashed and instead of the hotdog they served us poop in a piss soaked bun. Do not waste your time and especially money on this. At least not for the state that the game is in now."

9182,"Very addictive game, can spend hours playing it and it feels like it's been 15 mins. 
Best part is building a massive poop volcano then damming it off for infinite electricity. And if I feel like it, I can just remove the dam and give my citizens what they deserve for moaning about not having things like ""healthcare"" and ""education""
DLC pushes can be a bit much and is also pricey, but all in all 10/10 would recommend."
9183,"Great game, addicting. There are lots of possibilities with this game."
9184,yes
9185,easy to do at least 24 hours straight

9187,too easy to destabilize huge swathes of city with tiny expansions across the map basically deleting hours of gameplay
9188,yeah i like this game
9189,I use to love simcity. This is an updated simcity.
9190,great game
9191,You build cities.
9192,very fun
9193,"An interesting take on the city-building genre but weak in multiple key areas:

* DLC model remains abusive as the European Union still has not put forth a legal directive addressing this growing concern.
* The economy, if you can call it that, is too easy to build up and lacks tangibility. Goods such as food and medicine should be concrete items in the game which citizens need to be able to access sufficiently to prevent death.
* There is no sense of governance. Tax and policy screen are not enough. This is Cities: Skylines, not Grids: Skylines.
* Immigrants magically appear despite your city being less attractive than Siberian gulags or post-industrial British cities and require no integration efforts.
* You can't separate lanes into roads without modding and must build everything as T-intersections. There's not a single highway in the world that looks like this.
* All buildings require a road connection even if it doesn't make sense - such as beach buildings.
* Concrete and forest brushes and zonability was not added in the game for some reason, leaving ugly patches of grass here and there.
* Zero interactions with the outside world."
9194,I just wish it worked on my PC.
9195,"If you obsess over this game, then you probably should be an engineer... just saying.  This feeds into a systems engineer's brain and never lets go.  So many options to enhance your experience as sheer will.  I had to buy a new computer because of this game.  Too good."
9196,"good game, havent really done a proper run yet but i built a city and then made a moat around them that they filled up with their own excrement, was fun"
9197,good one
9198,Awesome city builder game. Lots of tools and possibilities.

9202,"I used to be very intimidated by this game, I struggled to learn how to play it. It took me hours and countless failed cities to finally start to get the hang of it all. Now I can get a city to the endgame in one afternoon, and I am kind of addicted to playing. 
10/10 I love watching my city grow"

9210,"Great game that you can pour an infinite amount of time into - it's everything I could've dreamed of in terms of a city builder.

A few things that bothered me while playing.

- to get full enjoyment from the game, you usually need to have mods and purchase expensive DLC

- Powerful PC required to fully enjoy it

Hope this helps :)"
9211,it's good
9212,one of the best games i played ever

9217,"i love this game, and hope will get DLC's more!"
9218,Got into it in 2022 through a special someone and it's already one of my favourite games ever.
9219,"The best city builder and simulator of the present time. The community never stops to innovate and introduce new modifications that you didn't know you needed, and this game has such a large amount of user created assets and content that most of the time there is an asset of something if you need it.

Most of the DLC offer a fair portion of content expansion, although a majority aren't worth their full price.

Here's hoping for CS:2 and a new engine that is more optimized!"
9220,"This game is harder than dark souls, there is no winning only endless pain. 10/10"
9221,This is the best city building game in the history of building games
9222,gud game
9223,This game made me quit video games.
9224,"Cities Skylines is one of my favourite games. Luckily I have both the console (PS4) and now PC version. Although PC version enables Mods expanding possibilities, the Console version is still worth playing on.

The creative strategy city building game offers countless hours of fun using different maps. Each map containing natural resources and landscapes that challenge the process.

Almost everything has been thought of (with DLC content added) to deliver the needs of cities utilities, services, leisure, tourism and more. Zoning areas via colours and road-hugging blocks/grids allows simple and effective construction of the city. Although economically speaking this seems to favour blocked approach building, you can still step into curves and lines easily for custom planning. The terrain editing tool adds to a unique skyline and water fronts to alter the base map.

The tool set you get to use makes city building simple. It doesn't take long to figure out the fundamentals  and hints and tips get you moving quicker. However, the idea is to build and manage the city's needs, therefore the finances add a sense of responsibility and pacing in a well balanced (and optional) way. A cursor is the default selection tool shifting with the camera for quick maneuvering.

The graphics style appealed to me over other similar games because it strikes a nice balance of vibrantly detailed objects and terrain. It doesn't take itself too seriously with cars and people simplified as one should expect, and yet the cities are just as beautiful to admire as real cities. The variety of assets are easy on the eye and regional alterations for, European, default or modern city centre adds just enough before looking for modded content.

Whats missing: After many hours of playing this game there's not much missing and only minor bug-bares. I would have found it very useful to have a sketching or rough planning tool ahead of time. Although you can adjust and grow the city at any time, there are only so many tiles to unlock. (the first is mandatory) I'd like to save a general sketch of my original ideas. This is where I find the unlocking of squared areas or tiles, on a map a little annoying. It feels like a restriction to the map, and granted the maps are only so big. Id have enjoyed picking my own starter tile, having the outside connections alter into position to the one I choose. It's a small detail and I understand the limitations of the maps. There is also the hardships of working below ground for tunnel connections. Its not as clear in congested areas how low you are or when something is linked to a node-connector. Sometimes its even harder to select an underground route node after the port or stop has been altered or removed, often meaning a completed deletion of a line to rid of the unselectable item.

Overall I would highly recommend this game even if you've played or never played a Simulation style game. 8.5 / 10 for me.

Between the two versions: I would recommend the PC version overall. It offers more in the long run providing you have adequate hardware for a hassle free experience. Mods aren't required to deliver a fulfilling experience either. By no means can you go wrong with the console version and I have preferred using a game pad to play this.

So, go build your city!

9225,sick
9226,a
9227,10/10 the new Airport dlc is amazing for me and probably other people. The endless community mods and creations are the best.
9228,fun fun
9229,"I seriously cant get enough of this game. The modding community is great and honestly is what kept this game from aging. I really hop Paradox and Colossal either give us a remake version of the game with inhanced graphics and some most used mods pre built into the game, such as traffic manager, and anarchy road, tree, and prop. Network skin, and node controller, and spawn point would also be appreciated. Also a full sandbox mode would be awesome to see with infinite demand, money, resource, etc. Or you could just call it City Skylines 2 ""hint hint, wink wink"" :P"
9230,its good game
9231,"Just in 3 hours, I can say that this game is just awesome and addictive. If you've ever wanted to make your own city, get this game immediately."
9232,"Amazing game! Known so much stuff you wouldn't think when purchasing this game! Worth the $30, looks amazing with great appearance and shows you the needs of building a city. It's not hard to learn at all took me only 2 days to know almost everything!"
9233,loved this game since i started playing it would recomend
9234,"its a very good game may take some time to get to know how it works and would past time just like that.
i have had a good time when i am on it"
9235,"You can probably enjoy this game (more like ""traffic flow simulator"") if you're an antisocial freak and enjoy activities equivalent to sitting in an empty room and playing with plastic building blocks all by yourself. Unfortunately I am not such person. Would've been much, much better game if it had fully functional multiplayer where you could do things like help neighboring player cities by selling various resources and services to them or spread the crime, diseases and pollution from your city to other player's neighboring cities as a form of ""PvP"" or compete for tourist resources with each other or do other fun things together with your friends or random players. It's both sad and amazing that even half-broken, old game with tiny in-game territory like last SimCity is still better than this game in regards to multiplayer."
9236,"Amazing city builder, the workshop is also amazing. You can do so much with this game, I would give this a 8/10 because of the DLCs they are good but a few feature should have been in the base game."
9237,I had sex once! With a lady

9247,10/10 game would game again
9248,<3
9249,is good
9250,the best
9251,"I love this game as its sort of like if Sim City gave you infinitely more control over the cities you create. There is enough complexity to keep the game fun, and the modding community really extends the game into an everyday play. DLC comes out pretty often even now after seven years of being available."
9252,Its very challenging and allows you to be creative. Not a straight forward game where you follow a certain Path
9253,Really fun Game. Although it is a bit confusing at first you understand it very fast.
9254,this is the best game on the planet
9255,.
9256,fun
9257,Yes please
9258,This is an amazingly realistic game and is so cool to play. I would definitely recommend this games to anyone who is interested

9263,"I'm going to get lost in this title, aren't I?"
9264,.
9265,2
9266,I build cities and that
9267,"This game is terrific, lots of buildings and trolling to do in this game."
9268,"I wish Steam would make a 5 star rating system instead of recommend or not. I'd like to give this game a thumbs up for the actual game itself. It's miles above anything EA has ever put out in Sim City. Cities Skylines seems to continue to have new content made for it unlike Sim City that's been left to rot and die in favor of the never ending expansions for The Sims. But there in lies the problem. While it's nice that this game still gets content, the content is largely not free. This is where I give the game a hard thumbs down.

Right now if I wanted to buy every single DLC for Cities Skylines I'd have to pay a whopping $208. Even on sales not all of the content is reduced and I'm still spending well over $100 for what are mostly just little building pieces here and there, or some other systems they've made for the game. One thing I don't get is why we have an expansion for airports when airports are already in the game. Do I need more to do the same thing while having to pay for them? To top that off, they do a good job trying to entice you to buy the stuff by putting the pieces in game but telling you that it requires an expansion to use something. This is one of the more predatory game developers in terms of trying to attack your wallet with the carrot on a stick type of method. Unfortunately I don't fall for this because I'm simply not going to drop a whopping $200 on a city builder. If anything they need to consolidate their DLC into affordable bundles. I would pay $10-$20 for a bundle of DLC, but as it stands the individual DLC prices are exorbitant and this has prevented me from replaying this game a whole lot. I fire it up every now and then and immediately get discouraged to continue because I know the potential for the game to be fun if only the DLC wasn't so ridiculous especially in today's pandemic economy.

Lastly this is one of the more egregious games in terms of collecting and selling private info of yours. I actually took a bit of time after being forced to agree to their EULA/TOS to read what it said. Basically they collect all kinds of info about you. To me this game is great but it's loaded with spyware and then they sell the info on top of that. So to add insult to injury, not only are they overcharging on the DLC and trying to make ridiculous amounts of money off that, but they are collecting and selling your info as well. Why do I need a video game to collect info about what I do in the game or on my computer or where I'm located? Games NEVER had this kind of stuff built into them until the internet became a thing. Anyone could load their nintendo cartridge in and play with no issue. I could go buy games on CD or DvD ROM at the store, install them, and just play. No one was collecting crap about me and selling it for profit. Sad to see yet another company engaging in this kind of behavior. But the attitude is as long as they tell you they are doing it in their EULA, then somehow it must be ok. 

A wonderfully developed game marred by ridiculously priced DLC and invasive data collection practices. What a darn shame.

TLDR: Buy the base game, it's miles above Sim City. Don't get sucked into the overpriced DLC until this company consolidates it or drastically lowers the price to something practical for most people. The game buys and sells your info by requiring a third party account with them while gouging you for that DLC all at the same time."

9270,It's fun and engaging
9271,"bike paths are dlc, cringe

protip: try not to make ppl drink their own poopoo if you can help it"
9272,"If you like City, you will like this game."
9273,"Awesome strategy, city building game"
9274,poop

9276,"Had this game ever since release in 2015, though the game play is pretty much the same it certainly had some big improvement since then. If you are willing to empty the wallet for the DLCs like any other paradox game, it can be very enjoyable for a few weeks."
9277,Prefured over Sim City by a long shot.
9278,Good game.
9279,Very fun city building game! Worth 40 bucks!
9280,I spent $200 on a game I was only able to play once. Since the last update the game is completely broken. Other than that the game WAS fun.
9281,Love this game
9282,"Nice game. Think I like it, kinda."
9283,fun
9284,yup
9285,addicting
9286,"Very good game! Compared to Sim City 5, this is waaayy better. The modding community is amazing, and overall a fun, decent game with lots to do! The Ep's are also amazing and add a lot of value. It is a RAM eater but other than that, it's a good game!"
9287,Fun filled game!
9288,traffic :(
9289,Great game love it
9290,"A great city building simulator, the disasters dlc is great."
9291,Love Cities Skylines!!
9292,This game is the definitive city building game even so many years after launch. It's also just a good zen to play.
9293,"I played it when it was for free for a couple of days, gonna say it's too expensive for a game that made in 2015."
9294,good
9295,dumb game but fun
9296,Great game!  I never thought I would like fixing traffic problems.
9297,Best game
9298,city
9299,This is the best Sim city replacment i have played!
9300,GGWP
9301,good game agree
9302,This is a great game. Many possibilities and lots of support from the community and asset creators.
9303,Is very good =O
9304,"very addictive
go play it 
and buy some crack"
9305,"Highly Addictive. Very Fun. Wish that more public transit options and content were both in the base game and in the Mass Transit DLC.

Base Game is overpriced when not on sale. DLCs to avoid are Snowfall and Sunset Harbor, the rest should be fine. Mass Transit is a must buy DLC imho."
9306,Best thing about this game is how realistic it is
9307,Good Game
9308,Chill and delightful... even when the traffic becomes a nightmare.  ;)
9309,I love it
9310,Great game to play for hours without getting bored
9311,"good game I am the most uncreative person in the world and i already made few nice cities i also recommend playing ""sandbox"" the inf money mod because its easy and i like sandboxs"
9312,"good, lil bit hard for me"
9313,so uh i got city skylines for free its a good game ngl and i wanna play it agian cuz i cant becuase i have to pay for it now :(
9314,disturbing
9315,"oe meui fookeng god
soe guud!
but the devs should make it easier, cuz its hard asf if you don't follow cookie cutter tutorials or have experience.
definately recommend."
9316,"I have been playing this game since the release. I have also bought all major DLCs. Let me assure you, it was the best city building game upon release and is still the best of the best ones today.

Year 2015: 3x3 = 9 tiles is such a large map. My small town can't nearly fill all of them.
Year 2016: Oh there is a mod to unlock 5x5 = 25 tiles! Now I can build more!
year 2017: 25 tiles are all filled up. I wish I get 7x7 = 49.
Year 2018: There is a crazy modder that make all 9x9 = 81 tiles unlocked! How can any crazy geek build on all of them?
Year 2020: It's 81 tiles but... how do I get more space? I know let's play the desert map. No need for water. All land to build!
Year 2022: [Counting tiles one by one to make sure it's really 81 tiles] How come 81 tiles are this small? Can someone please bestow us 15x15 = 225 tiles?? Please also raise all those node/building limit! Where is my Cities Skyline 2!?"
9317,"After install Airport DLC, the game keeps crashing and could never start.  It supposes to be a good game, but ends up like a garbage.
Be aware that the refund policy ONLY refund your recent purchase.  Therefore, make sure you are ready to loose your investment before purchasing."
9318,Fun game
9319,"This was a game that kept me hooked for a while, managing my own city and keeping the citizens happy was very satisfying to do overall."
9320,Great game love playing it endless opputunities
9321,not stonks
9322,"It's like Sim City, but still good!"
9323,its just a great game
9324,"Abusive Community, manipulated by the Community manager, keylogger in the game, exfiltrating to Paradox Online Publishing, steam authentication token transmitted to Paradox Online (this means Paradox has full access to your Steam account, friends lists, communications, etc), buggy game with a clique of modders competing with each other to plant executables on your computer.

This game still uses an army of youtube, twitter, etc paid promoters, to try to keep it alive. Employees sabotage the player base, and it's overrun by trolls, coordinated by the Community Manager herself, who's only community management experience is running a World of Warcraft guild. Programmers are amateurs who learnt to code by cutting and pasting Minecraft mods, but lack any computer science education.

Don't walk, RUN AWAY.

Don't use this even for free, there are better games to spend time  on."
9325,fun game
9326,love it
9327,It's the funnest game EVER!!!  It's fun to build and manage your city...the hours just disappear!
9328,"Now that i learned to play this great Building sim i can honestly say i have come to like it alot of course one need to learn from mistakes but thats whats great about Games one can start over and over till you get the hang of it, plus all the DLC's available and Mod's to all of the Awesome folks who create them Big thanks too them always grateful to the modsters and all there hard work, for us to enjoy."
9329,"Very fun and addicting. Don't rage quit when you don't understand it. Managing and solving problems is the most fun part of the game. Acknowledge that this isn't the game for everyone. I've played for 30 hours and its been nothing but fun. Looking at the work you've done is amazing. Don't be let down by mistakes that you can't fix, just go along with it and build your city around the problems. The game wouldn't be fun if you had no problems to work around. Always remember, there is always the next city, the city better than the last."
9330,city go brrrrrrrRRrRRr
9331,"As much as I like the freedom to create immensely through mods, I just don't want to waste anymore time with the issues I've had thanks to the devs. After countless hours building and detailing a city the moment that there's a forced update that prevents you from accessing your save file unless the game is updated, your save file is literally sabotaged. A community mods and assests become incompatible forcing me to have to start over. I've had this happen since 2018 and hadn't played since because I didn't want to go through the pain of my maps becoming inaccessible again"
9332,"A great city builder with support for multiple platforms, and a vibrant modder community on PC. It is very taxing on your PC memory, though."
9333,NUT
9334,Amazing Graphics and Gameplay
9335,"I love this game, take awhile to get into. I reccomd watching someone play it first to understand how to fix certain problems. I love this game tho"
9336,It's exactly the right amount of chill.
9337,"Sim City 4 has nothing on this game. Although, the DLC could be priced a bit better, the base game is really good and has come a long way. It's a true homage to the games of yore."
9338,"lots of fun ways to torture citizens, great game"
9339,sick
9340,"Fun to build your city, but the traffic ai is terrible. In my highway, the cars only use 1 lane of the highway, and even after downloading several traffic manager mods it did not help at all. All in all, worth the money, best 30 dollars spent in my life."
9341,"Love this game, I'm not good at it, but I do love it."
9342,love city building
9343,minimum system requirement : the whole Skynet computer
9344,maybe worth it on 90% sale
9345,"Cities Skylines gives a great city building experience while giving the player the freedom to design, build, and run their city the way they want. It is designed to allowed the player to use custom assets and mods to help make the city better or fit the players desires. The downfall of the game is the demanding requirements needed to run it, especially with a lot of mods and assets."
9346,BEST city building game EVER... and yes better than Sim City 4 !! LOVE THIS GAME at least as much as SC4. I will buy the DLCs allso to add more stuff to the game but i love how it works.. how you can easely put shit to peoples water and they drink shit polluted water and stuff like that if your not carefull :D Enjoy gamers... nice relaxing game. Love it and cant wait if the devs are planing something new in 2-3 years?
9347,yea its alright i guess
9348,Best City Building Game Ever. Period.
9349,"It's like Sim City on steroids...not an easy game, you have to figure out how a lot of stuff works by trying it, or reading guides online. For example, how to build a good bus line or how certain factors effect each other in game. But it's very beautiful and satisfying to look at your city grow, follow a bus or pedestrian around and see what they see for a day...and unlock all the challenges and special buildings. I really love this game, I have some of the DLC as well; highly recommend the Day and Night DLC because it also comes with bike paths."
9350,"It's fun
"
9351,.
9352,city go brr
9353,I have been addicted to this game since it first came out. I just wish there were more options on PS4 to adjust roads etc.

9355,"Pretty Epic Not Gonna Lie

9356,"An absolute fantastic spiritual successor to SimCity, the Cities franchise has renewed my hope that the mantle that Maxis had dropped has been picked up and carried by other companies and Paradox is no different. If you want a very expansive city building game to put in a ton of hours, this is your queue. There are a lot of addons you can get that expands on the game even more, but even the stock game has a ton of neat features by balancing the books, and making your own zones; specialised areas where they can have their own set of rules. Adding to that, you can basically make your industrial zones specialise in farming or forestry, there just seems to be a lot of fun tools that the SimCity franchise never had a chance to explore too much. 

The only caveat on this is I feel like there's too much thrown at you when your town levels up. You are never in a situation to understand everything fully all the tools that are thrown at you. That, and, if you build too fast some towns and you come to a point where you box yourself in financially, it is hard to get yourself out of it. This happens a lot in early times where new buildings are unlocked but that you shouldn't probably add those new buildings right away. 

If there is a tip to any fledgling players: Do not build something until the town really asks for it or you get into an issue; you will run into monetary issues at the start. This becomes less of an issue when your town takes off but at the start, build conservatively! 

Fun game, scratches the SimCity game but I never really sunk as much time in this as I have with SimCity. Not sure why but there's just something about it that 'isn't' SimCity and you know it. I still am trying to figure this out but this is not to take away from Cities; it is its own fantastic city builder."
9357,people cant stop drinking poo
9358,Years later and this is still the best City Builder to date. If your looking for a city builder to sync hours upon hours in look no further than Cities: Skylines.
9359,"Great game! If you are into SimCity you'll love this game, it's more in depth than SimCity as well. You can download mods too so easily. This game is a very relaxing and chill game to play without needing too much knowledge of city building games. I will say though that in the beginning it might be a little difficult to get your city up and running."
9360,I know it can seem hard in the beginning but please stick with it
9361,it a good game
9362,"highly recommend. way better than sims 
"
9363,Probably the best cities sim at the moment
9364,very fun especially on ceative mode !
9365,
9366,"This game, even without any DLC, is insanely fun and can easily absorb hours of my time. Having easy access to fan-made content from the workshop is also awesome and adds on a ton of fun and entertainment to the game. I totally recommend this to anyone who enjoys wasting their time and/or hours of mindless clicking and fun. This is the best game ever."
9367,"The best city builder ever. 

Great simulation and the modding scene is huge and really adds so much to the game. I remember spending 16 hours a day playing this game and just beautifying my city."
9368,"This is the best City Builder game out there for more than 5 years! 
Using the Steam Workshop to get MODs and custom Assets will change everything! :)"
9369,"muy bein
"
9370,WEF
9371,"I must say the game overall is great. The graphics are pretty good and the DLC is so worth it, you can go onto steam workshop and add even more stuff. Thing is its quite a difficult game, and I slowly lost interest. I want the perfect city but it is very time consuming"
9372,Literally an amazing game. No more needs to be said.
9373,good
9374,good game
9375,"Amazing game to play, turn on a playlist on spotify or listen to a podcast and design a full city to your hearts desire. Mods can even make the game 10x better."
9376,ja
9377,yes
9378,cock
9379,good game
9380,ive literally never played this game in my life
9381,"decent game, got lots of variety, i recommend"
9382,"Build city
download mods
city takes 10 minutes to load because of mods
download more mods
enjoy
8/10 would recommend"
9383,The best city builder sim since Sim City 4.
9384,As always paradox disappoints every player by filling the game with tens of DLCs. Shame.
9385,"Friggin' awesome city sim.

Even after 7 years it still holds up perfectly fine. Everything except water running out works as it should and exceptionally well at that!"
9386,"The best city building simulation so far!

Wishes for part 2:
- A graphics update. Part 1 looks good, but there is more possible. This also applies to the colorgrading.
- A revision for the UI. Many of the menus look messy and unorganized. In addition, some building menus are unrorrectly sorted.
- The mods ""Move It"" and ""Traffic Lights"" should be natively incorporated into the main game. It's quite annoying that you can't easily move built roads in the main game afterwards. This ensures that building sometimes becomes very fiddly.
- There are too many DLCs and not all of them are worth the money.
- Some mechanics like the production chains in the Industries DLCs are quite unintuitive. It would be nice if it was clearer what you had to do and you didn't have to watch YouTube videos to understand what the game wants you to do.

9463,"As much as I loved this game at release, it's just not fun. It's the kind of game where I always seem to fall asleep while playing. There just isn't any real challenge, it's ""build, wait, and repeat."" The graphics haven't aged well and the look of the game feels cheap. The high points of the game are designing intricate transportation systems and solving congestion issues. But at some point this becomes more of a chore."

9474,
9475,"Honestly the best city-simulator game out there. There's no other game like it, and it'll keep you playing for hours and hours. You can never get truly bored of it, even if you get away from the game for months, or you lose that world of yours due to a glitch with mods, you'll still come back for more.
Game is great as well for things such as city-planning and the adversity of overcoming traffic.
Not a lot of criticism apart from the odd glitches, but glitches mainly happen with mods such as Fine Road Anarchy or other mods such like it.
Game is real fun when you spice it up with mods like Traffic Manager or Network Extensions or others.

"
9476,Do you like constantly fixing traffic? then this game is for you!
9477,"[h1][i]City Skylines[/i] Review [/h1]

9483,build city
9484,Sim City for a new generation.  There have been several times that I have been playing for 2 to 3 hours and completely lost track of time.  It's easy to get engrossed in this game.  There is so much you can do and so much to keep up with. Completely worth the time and money for simulator nerds like me.
9485,"a bit of a learning curve, but totaly worth it.
Specially if it on sale"
9486,"Oh my days, this game is nuts!

C:S is my favorite game, I would recommend it to anyone. The vanilla game is pretty good, and when you get bored of it, there's tons of crazy mods and assets on the workshop that allow you to build amazingly realistic cities.

The only annoying thing about this game is the DLCs. There are a lot of them and they all become more essential the more you play the game. Good strategy, Paradox, it really works. That does not mean the base game is trash, but each DLCs add a lot.

That being said, if you are willing to eventually pay about 100 dollars/euros (when it's on sale) for the game, don't think twice. You will be satisfied. Have fun building your dream city!"
9487,"Well you are buying this game, but then have to purchase more thing and more things."
9488,"Spiritual successor to the original Sim City, the best city sim yet."
9489,"The game is hard to understand at first, but with the help of some youtube videos it's pretty easy to pick up. The base game is fun and you can do a lot with it, but downloading some mods really makes the game a lot more immersive"
9490,They have milked this thing into the ground. They want this to be a live service bloated with DLC abomination where none of the packs integrate well or are cohesive with one another. How about you just make number 2 instead of turning every single new buyer off when they see the ridiculous price and amount of DLC this live service has.

I know that it is a part of the game but there should be a mode/mod where you can remove it. (I haven't checked workshop) But the game is good for a ""challenging"" aspect. To be honest I recommend it if you like city builder games, at least if there is a Steam Sale."

9506,Nice game!!:)
9507,I love this game!
9508,i fucking suck
9509,What Sim City should have been!
9510,very nice for any women or men in world of tank this text makes big sense rigt? i dunno what iam saying in this typeboard but its okay mahomeu
9511,"Base game has very little content, most cities can be made self functioning with a few hours of gameplay. All of the actual GOOD content is locked behind paywalls and DLC."
9512,Good game. Has too much capitalism however.
9513,"Of course I recommend this. It's amazing. It stimulates both sides of the brain. I can exercise creativity AND problem solving here. Cities Skylines is a 10/10 game. It's getting a bit dated in visuals, but the modding community for this game is insanely good. After seeing a few YouTubers talk about mods, I got hooked on this game and that's also when I really started to learn things about logistics and city planning.

It's another one of those games that's easy to learn, hard to master. It is as relaxing or as intense as you want it to be. If you're looking for a fresh new way to express yourself with as few limitations as possible, this is one very good option for you. I'll always love Cities Skylines and I hope everyone who likes city-building games gets a chance to dive into this someday. It's the best one I've played by a long shot.

Get some of the dlcs, look for visual mods, and design mods that let you fine tune streets and such, and this will give you hundreds of hours of fun.

P.S. play this game with the Sim City 3000 soundtrack. Thank me later"
9514,"The Best City builder by far , along with the mods"
9515,"This is a game unlike anything else out there. Great gameplay and awesome replayability thanks to mods. The only downside is performance when your city gets large, but that is to be expected for a game this detailed."
9516,best traffic simulator on the market
9517,okkkk
9518,BEST EVER
9519,Steal your life xD
9520,gd game
9521,It is a very addicting game
9522,Good game
9523,"Game was great until airports dlc, with or without mods the game isnt stable enough to last more than 15 minutes anymore, and considering it takes 20 to even start, this almost has me playing simcity 2013 again, at least that runs
"
9524,Awesome
9525,my comfort game
9526,Get mods to solve traffic problems not intended by the game.
9527,Solid Game
9528,I keep forgetting about the rest of my life.
9529,"Good game, but that's just my opinion"
9530,Honestly i like cities
9531,might be my laptop but crashes every time I save.
9532,i found carl
9533,obama didnt kill himself
9534,It's fun to see when you just can't simply fulfill one's needs for the sake of the city.. You have some choice just to satisfy a small group of citizen's needs or decide what's the best options for the city's future.. And that's hard to either fulfill or ignore those needs.
9535,big sity so cool
9536,Best city building game ever.
9537,"Very fun, runs smooth, even base game has lots of options for city building. Would recommend!"
9538,This positive review is locked behind 38 DLCs and counting.
9539,"Its a nice chill game, as being a night owl, i like to play this game during the hours of the night, its calming"
9540,You have to mod the game in order to make slip lanes.
9541,"Fantastic variety of options. So much variety. Biggest frustration - would have liked a legit tutorial, but there's TONS of info on YouTube."
9542,"I like trains
"
9543,"Where to start with Cities Skylines...

I guess I can start by saying that I have been playing this game for years, first on Xbox One, now on here.  In that time, I have made 5 successful cities and am now attempting to make my own creative map and city.  I probably have if I had a hazard to guess, like 2-3 hundred hours on Xbox one alone.  Now you might be asking, why do I, along with the myriads of other reviewers of this game find this game so rewarding and addicting?  I'll tell you.

WHAT IS CITIES: SKYLINES?

Cities Skylines is a city builder from Colossal Order and published by Paradox Interactive.  It represents some of the best that the genre of city building has to offer.  It was made by a small, passionate, dedicated team after the colossal (no not that one) failure of Sim City 2013.  In fact, the failure of that game is what got this game greenlit by Paradox.  It has managed to maintain a very dedicated fan base who have, for the most part, been satisfied or even enthusiastic about the games development so far.  It has a strong modding community, a strong YouTube presence in the way of content creators like two dollars twenty, Biffa plays Indie Games, and bsquiklehausen, and more.  

WHAT MAKES THIS GAME GREAT?

-great simulation of not only city building, but planning as well.  Road layout matters, city services matter, education matters, and more.
-A dev team who is engaged with their community and the content creators on YouTube as well. Maybe arguably not to the level that they were at launch, but they at least care to put out great tutorials on their YouTube channel made by Cities Skylines YouTubers in an effort to help us better play and understand the game and make better cities.
-a variety of different buildings, some theme based, some not including
-speaking of themes, the game gives you four themes (five with a dlc) to build your city around.  Temperate, Boreal, Tropical, European, and Winter.  This helps in giving you a tool to make your city feel unique.  A city that relies on tourism is going to feel and look different if its a tropical paradise versus a European city in the vain of Monte Carlo.
-planning of your city does more than look nice.  How you put down city services, transport options, parks, and more has an effect on how much your buildings level up.  The more they do, the more money you make, the more you can build.
-a simulated economy in your city.  In addition to running a city budget, the game also simulates economics to a degree.  Raw resources like Timber, oil, ore, and agricultural products are made, then taken to processing plants that refine them.  The refined goods are then taken to industrial factories that produce goods and provide your citizens jobs.  The goods are then taken to shops to be sold to your citizens with the shops providing more jobs.  The excess of all of the manufactured goods and resources is then shipped outside of the city to neighboring regions where they are then sold, with all this money coming back to you.  The Industries dlc, while not necessary, adds even more dimension to this simulation.
-education plays an important factor in city growth.  More educated workers means higher level buildings have people to work there.  The higher level buildings make more money for you.  Not only that, educated citizens make less trash, so it is important to focus on education as well.
-near limitless mods on the steam workshop with assets, mods, custom maps, and themes that you can download

SOUNDS A BIT TOO PERFECT RIGHT?  SO WHY WOULD YOU STAY AWAY FROM THIS GAME?

-a lot of expensive dlc.  I have all the dlc so I can say that not all of it is necessary.  I would say that your most critical ones really depend on your taste.  I personally find the After Dark, Sunset Harbo(u)r, Campus, and Industries dlc's needed to breathe new life and make your cities feel more alive and buzzing, but what you want is up to your taste.  
-Game has some technical limits if you want to make maps.  You can only make terrain up to 1 km tall, which if you want mountains, or are using a height map, you will not be able to make really tall terrain.  
-Game with mods, assets, and dlc's installed, depending on your rig, can make your game lag all the way home.  Be careful how much your subscribe to on the workshop and what interacts with what.

In short I'd give this game an 8.5 bordering on a 9.0.  It is fun, addicting, and engaging.  It is one the best experiences of its kind, and will stand as a benchmark for which all other city builders will be judged.

If you want to give it a try, then hope you have fun and see what you can do.  You might just be impressed with what you can make and do."
9544,Good soup
9545,very good game
9546,"Best city-builder in the market. The modders are hard workers but unfortunately the game's optimization leaves something to be desired, especially when modding your game.

Game with Major DLC is 10/10 otherwise.

[b]Major DLC[/b] (adds mechanics)(in order of most important to least in my opinion)
-1st. Industries DLC, adds industry and development in multiple fields like lumber, tech, oil.

-2nd. Mass Transit + After Dark DLCs, they bring different things but one is not more important than the other in my opinion. Mass' brings more transit options for citizens, 'Dark brings customization of commercial areas + bike lane streets, for bicycling in your city.

-3rd. Sunset Harbor + Parklife... 'Harbor brings some more misc. transport options, and fishing. Parklife brings customization and zoning of parks, increasing the value of your city.

DLC go on sale all the time, so I would wishlist and buy them during that."
9547,"As far as city building goes, this is by far the best thing to date. Cities Skyline takes the cake when it comes to getting your money's worth with a century long mod list from the Steam workshop that will inevitably consume any abundance of RAM you may think could handle this time enveloping tycoon. There are no limits with this game from basic city planning to making sure your city's population can go to work, walk their dog, get some exercise, and still be able to go to tonight's football game. I personally have hit my PC's RAM limit at 32GB and am thoroughly satisfied with spending the rest of my days trying to teach the OCD in me how to compromise and create the prefect city. I highly recommend this to everyone."
9548,I like this game because it is fun
9549,its fun af
9550,"built a magnificent city, was making so much money, then a meteor hit the water and created a massive tsunami that created a flood that lasted for a pretty long time and it killed 1500 people and destroyed 350 buldings, made my people decide to leave, and turned my economy into a huge downward red arrow. all my trams survived tho. 8/10"
9551,Buy it! Its even better with mods from the workplace. 10/10 Recommend
9552,"goodgame
"
9553,Best city building/sim game out there
9554,Nice graphic and freedom of city design!
9555,"I am 34.

My ex-wife and I have a daughter together, and adopted our son together. They are now both 4 years old.

When we were going through our separation, I found myself lost and miserable. I was self destructive. I got so mad one day from everything spiraling out of my control that I punched some concrete in a moment of overwhelming emotion. That caused me to break my 5th metacarpal in my right hand... my working hand... my games hand.. the hand that I held and carried my children to bed with.. The hand I desperately needed to make sure I could continue to provide.

After learning of the severity of my self-inflicted damage, I was borderline suicidal. Keep in mind that just a few months before this, I was the happiest man with no history of depression or anxiety. I have never had fits of rage, or been one to break down and cry, but I was in a low spot that just really buried me from being able to see the light on the other side.

Having nothing better to do, I searched for a game I could play, ONE HANDED while I recovered. I somehow stumbled upon this game and read some of the reviews. I decided that it had to be worth a shot... I must admit, I didn't beat the game, or play nearly as long as some of you. In fact, I may have only played this game a day or two.. With that being said, after doing so, I had a new found joy and hope for life. I was able to put behind me the pain and suffering that had been cast over me. I was able to experience other peoples joy and happiness. I was able to see the fruits of my ""labor"". I relaxed for 5 ♥♥♥♥ing minutes to this music long enough to realize that I was going to be okay.

After coming to that realization, I turned the game off, and I went back to work. It hurt my hand like hell but I was motivated. I stopped feeling so damn sorry for myself, and I became the father I needed to be in that moment, not the weak boy I was behaving as.

Today, I am close friend with my kids mother. We don't fight, or argue, or say hurtful things to each other. We are parents, and friends.

I now have 3 kids. My third child is, wait for it, ALSO 4 YEARS OLD. The woman I am with was going through a very similar situation at the time of my own separation, and we just stumbled in to each others life unexpectedly. We have been in a relationship for a year now, and are very happy together.

Moral of the story, you never know what life holds in store for you, and if I would have given up when all the odds were stacked against me, I wouldn't be where I am today. This silly little game helped me realize that."
9556,"cool game along with all the cool DLC 's .I recommend this to all of you people out there , it also has a great community ,with cool and awesome mods .Overall I a good game"
9557,cool

9563,fun
9564,"expect all issues to be caused by cars stuck in traffic, that includes garbage piling up, people dying, dead bodies not being picked up, economy collapsing, babies crying, goods not being sold, and people not going to school"
9565,"The vanilla + DLC game is pretty good, but with mods it's on another level. Definitely recommend this game!"
9566,Fun to play
9567,"cities skylines is literary the best game ever made, at least in my opinion, although it is super addictive. engaging yet relaxing (even can be intense if the traffic in your city gets out of hand...)"
9568,Super fun game with lots of building features. You encounter problems you wouldn't necessarily expect which adds a lot to the game. Better than other world building games I've tried in the past for sure!
9569,"Love it.  Great way to unwind and good choice for a low-stress, low-blood pressure gaming session.  There are minor quirks here and there but the community workshop is robust and filled with content that can help tailor your experience.  I also purchased the Airports DLC and I'm looking forward to trying out the fixed taxiways (though the modular airports mod has been a great fix and works well too)."
9570,I do recamend this game to other members tell them its hard to read some of the into
9571,"awesome  you get really creatiof

"
9572,Is what SimCity (2015) isn't. Just play it if you've spent hours playing SimCity 4.
9573,I'll stop building my city in a grid one day.
9574,"this game is so cool
"
9575,"Great game to kill some time. The mechanics are like SimCity; I prefer Cities over the latter due to the specific options to structure roads, change routes and alter intersection mechanics (Stop signs, traffic lights). The downside to Cities is the DLC; if you don't enjoy DLC to improve the gaming experience this may not be the game for you."
9576,XQC plays
9577,"Let me sit down and play this
-plays for 6 hours straight 
wtf its 4 am"
9578,"its fun but after you get to 60000, its basically done and there isnt anything else to do and the dlcs are too expensive. my current city is at 94000 and there is no challenge what so ever as I have so much money and literally cant lose unless i try to lose by destroying my city."

9583,"just saw a review with 8541 hours on this game. thats 355 days. that should say enough but this is a top 3-5 game all time for me. if you have a decent pc and a decent amount of ram, i recommend downloading some mods and custom assets, it changes the entire game. Amazing modding and player community. I have 32 gb ram and over 4600 assets and 50-60 mods. i need more ram but i also have an overkill on assets. i posted screenshots of my city if anyone is curious to see what modding and having custom assets is like. not the best quality tho bc i have a doodoo gpu"
9584,i am slow brain and still love this game.
9585,"This game is amazing, except the hundreds of dollars for DLC's you will want. Its a game not a business investment guys."
9586,Perfectly working Roundabouts make me hard.
9587,better zoo content
9588,"after i played this my dad was released from county jail, THANKS!!11!1!!11!!!!"
9589,"Get it on sale, worth it. DLC, not worth the cost"
9590,most detailed city game ive ever seen. of you like this type of game this is the one to get
9591,"good
"
9592,VERY FUN IF YOU LIKE CITY AND AIRPORT BUILDING.
9593,"A gentle game that feels rewarding without much stress, it's a bit like gardening."
9594,"I have never wasted more of my life than in this game. I don't regret any of it though. For such an old game it is still my most played and has been consistently for years. The community mods are amazing but even the DLC's really do add to the game. 

Will be hard for any competitor to achieve what Paradox has with this game and community!"
9595,"Fun Game, If you like the build or design things and want a pretty calm and chill game this is for you. Also if your computer sucks like mine, it runs pretty well too."
9596,"It's WELL overdue for a sequel, but it still offers the most options in a city building game by far.  Well worth it when it's on sale.  Still lacks some features and charm the last SimCity game (2014) had, but EA done killed and buried that series.  But good to see CO/Paradox continue add new features and content to this game 6yrs later!  Lets just hope they are hard at work on a Cities Skylines 2 now, maybe something that can use more than 8 threads!"
9597,Good stress reliever
9598,it's a great game
9599,Great game! The true city simulator.
9600,this stuff is so sick
9601,cool game eh
9602,
9603,:)
9604,bc this is a sandbox game
9605,Great game. It's exactly what it says it is.
9606,"Probably the best modern city builder there is. Since it's mod supported, you can do anything you'd like."
9607,"the amount of stuff in this game is mental, even without mods. idk what else to say its just a great game innit"
9608,Probably the most addictive game I've ever played in my life! Hours are racking up...
9609,Cuz
9610,good
9611,"rigtig godt ja
"
9612,gut
9613,"Very fun and intuitive. 
Cities: Skylines > SimCity"
9614,Could spend hours on this game :)
9615,"Build city, watch city grow, torture cims. 10/10"
9616,HAHA CITY GO BRRRRRRRRRRRR
9617,
9618,I recommend this game
9619,Dobrá hra
9620,"highly recommend this game nice grafics very great details, fun
"
9621,"I bought cities skylines a while back. When I first downloaded it froze for two to three hours. I never got to play it. I tried to get my money back, and I was told that I couldn't because I played the game for to long. I thought maybe it's because of an older laptop. Now, I have a brand new laptop, and the game crashed twice during the loading process. Again, I never  got to play it. I love this game, I've played it on gaming consoles before. I wanted to play it through steam because of the mods, but I don't think the trying to play it on a laptop or though Steam is gonna work for me."
9622,A very relaxing time filler. what can I say? the possibilities are endless especially with the mods.
9623,"I love Cities: Skylines. I have been playing it for three or four years now. It is far superior to Sim City which I played for years. I enjoyed it a lot at first and renewed expectations with each new release, but I became increasingly frustrated with it until I at last gave it up. There was a gap of several years until I discovered CS. To some extent I am having the same experience with CS. The difference is I enjoy it a lot more and the mod and asset makers make it a much better experience. I'm still frustrated with it but at a much lower level. I wish they could improve the way traffic chooses routes and lanes. They could make the responses to service calls more practical. There are a few other things. But it is still a lot of fun. There is no end to its creative possibilities. It is by far my favorite computer pastime. Four point nine stars."
9624,sex
9625,Better than the new Sim CIty
9626,"One of the relaxing games, you don't have to tense up it's all up to ypu."
9627,i was playing simcity 4 but its now an old game and cities skylines has lots of DLC to keep me entertained
9628,"having a good time with the game, hope to see more feature in the future"
9629,"After countless self-reflections, in various games, I realized that I am a builder and not a war fanatic. So Civilization, SimCity, and this game are all my favorites. However, it should be noted that the complexity of this game is much higher. Not only do you need to be good at strategy and industrial planning, but you also need the brains of designers."
9630,Brother Best Game EVER highly recommend getting it
9631,good city builder i guess
9632,"Get the DLC on sale. Radio you can skip. It's a good game, but after a save or two you'll want some mods that should be a part of the base game."
9633,"is good, traffic go slow, just like real life 10/10"
9634,yuh
9635,"If you like sim games or building things, this game i!s excellent for building cities! I absolutely am addicted to this game. Solving for issues like traffic and bus routes, etc are challenging! It's awesome to have the creative license to be resourceful and fix things using ingenuity."
9636,If you like building cities and viewing skylines then this is the game for you.
9637,great game
9638,if only the graphics were better and there wasnt a DLC for everything. The stock game is pretty lame and you have to spend quite a bit of money on the cool DLCs.. especially since mods that used to be available were made into DLC ideas.
9639,super game
9640,Would definitely recommend this to anyone enjoying sandbox city building etc.
9641,"my city is declining rapidly

i love it"
9642,love it :)
9643,good
9644,Named Cities Skylines. Can't build in sky. smh
9645,"It scratches the Sim City 4 itch. However, you do need DLC for the whole experience."
9646,its goated
9647,"citycitycitycitycity
"
9648,very fun cant wait for the sequel
9649,Everything SimCity could have and should have been.
9650,"For anyone just beginning, maybe with a few DLCs I would recommend watching though this playlist by City Planner Plays [url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iu8YwpngbzE&list=PLXdi-Ns7w3jjfNPMl836BKjxZONnxvXPw] The Ultimate Beginners Guide to Cities Skylines [/url]. They do a fantastic job at introducing the base game and then walking through the DLCs"
9651,haha town
9652,e
9653,"An extremely fun game!  I started out on console, and decided to move to PC because of the mods (and because it was on sale :|), and I was not disappointed!"
9654,great game
9655,"The ultimate of city-building games, even with its steep learning curve and discouraging introduction, once you learn the content and invest some time into the game it quickly will consume your life."
9656,i hate it
9657,"So Easy To Spend Countless Hours Building, Designing, Managing and Fixing. It Addicting! The Pure Joy, Challenge and at times frustration is a experience i have not seen in any other game!"
9658,good :)
9659,Hours played says enough
9660,amazing game very fun
9661,its fun watching your civilians struggle to survive
9662,"Surprised I haven't reviewed Cities: Skylines yet. I really am happy this game exists. It is the true successor and king of the City builders. I'm sure you've heard of it by now. I do wish there was more management to the game, as it feels more like a city painter than a city manager game. Oh well, worth it on sale.

7/10"
9663,"it's like what i imagined simcity would be like in my head, but actually real."
9664,pretty sick
9665,yes
9666,"best game i ever played hours and hours creative gameplay unlimited mods, but very hiigh requirements for hardware"
9667,its ok.
9668,It's ok!
9669,.
9670,fun game!
9671,why everyone turn left..? just turn right? lol
9672,Very much recommended. Please use mods like roundabout mods ect since there's not many roundabout options in vanilla
9673,Too many DLCs which are all very pricey.
9674,"gud
"
9675,"cozy game :3
can be a bit slow, but if you go into detail on everything it gets pretty interesting"
9676,"So this game is a crash-simulator? My PC is hooked up to it's own nuclear power plant, has 2.3 million sq. feet. of space avalible, the brain of 3 quantum computers, 32 GB of pure RAM and 4090TI 16K graphics card and yet still it manges to fry it.. How?! And it only gets worse every time you try to boot it up. First time you can get into a game, second time you reach the in-game menu, third time you only make it to the launcher and then its never going to start again.."

9680,Good Game
9681,"I spent my time learning mods more than playing this game and it's turning me into a perfectionist, which I don't want to omg 😭
Anyway, great sandbox game! 👍😀"
9682,Good game to spend a lot of time in.
9683,"This game is a lot of fun. The UI makes sense, you get information you need when and where you need it.  It is easy to figure out all the new DLC. I'm having a lot of fun with this game.  It's complicated in a good way and isn't difficult to learn how to play. 

I can get sucked in and play for hours on weekends or just check in and casually mess with my city for a few minutes after work. 

It's a great game to play after work for a few hours here and there.  There isn't a steep learning curve and it has a lot of replay value."
9684,"The definitive city builder - with mod support and DLC, I can build the city of my dreams (and I now finally see why cities pursue fruitless highway widening projects! Traffic flow is never fixed...)"
9685,1200 hours in this is the most detailed and realistic city builder game I have ever played! Too many features to list here but you will never get bored of creating your ultimate city.
9686,Amazingly fun game! just sit down for hours working on a little neighborhood and still not get bored. Learn how to manage city and towns!
9687,Game Shlaps
9688,cool
9689,Love it
9690,noice
9691,DLC is littie!
9692,"this game is fun and very addicting, you will most likely play for more than 30 minutes, dlcs are fun to mess with, but one thing though....its very confusing, especially for new players, so much features and complexity, when you first play it, you will get confused with water and energy services"
9693,"I love this game! I highly recommend to anybody who enjoy's building games. Tough learning curve at first but they make it fun to learn with the emotes.

9694,the game doesnt work anymore

9702,"Seems like a cool game but unfortunately it wont even start, and it seems to be a problem for quite a few people as well.
0/10 :("
9703,a good game to just waste time
9704,Great game!
9705,nice and fun
9706,"This game is so in-depth. I feel like I'm just skimming the surface and there's still the expansion packs, which I've barely tapped into. It's challenging, there's always something to do and that needs to be expanded, constructed, re-zoned, etc. If you had fun with simcity, this is way better and a definite buy for you."
9707,nice
9708,"Best city building game by far... Easy to play, great graphics and bug-free."
9709,Great game. Its Simcity but better
9710,very addictive

9724,"This has surpassed Sim City as my favourite city building game. The standard of official DLC has been strong throughout the life of the game, though the Airports DLC does seem to make cargo airports a very poor second in comparison with passenger airports, as you have to build a top level passenger airport before getting access to the cargo airport. This is the only disappointment I have experienced with the game, but there is a wealth of cargo airport lots and props that have been created by players prior to Airports that can be built and function without that DLC. 

The range and amount of player created content is vast, and there are some extremely talented mod creators out there who have taken the game to levels I wouldn't have believed possible before exploring the workshop. A brilliant game and massively supported by the player community. Five Stars all the way for me."
9725,Amazing game
9726,"Lots of fun and tons of depth. If you like simulation games, there is plenty here and good value all things considered."
9727,good
9728,This game is from 2015! With some graphic mods it's a great looking game in 2022 and the best city builder I've ever played. Not even accounting for the DLCs. The base game is pure fun and nicely balanced!
9729,F
9730,just play
9731,"Awsome relaxing game that keeps you busy for hours if you like micro management.

A good experience where you just have a backseat relaxing time. With nice music and jokes on the radio (especially some of the music stations) The start can be a bit tricky, but when you learn you can enjoy it even more.

A few of the DLC packs give so much options and new mechanics that keeps you busy for hours.
- Industrial is fun a lot of custimization and a good money maker
- Parklife is just the fun to get creative with a different sort of building than streets and buildings
- Campus is fun but didn't keep me that busy and creative.
- Natural Disaster a fun one that makes it a little more a change of pace

- The smaller ones a nice edition but don't keep you that busy
 (Haven;t played airports)

Downsides: 
- Not enough options to guide the traffic, you need workshop mods to do that. Its availible but not in vanilla.
- Some DLC packs like mass transit, green city and snowfall are a bit lacking in usability. It gives a little more structures that i honestly never use cause i like to choosse the cheap option. And with only 3 snow maps you need to play those to even play that DLC like its meant to.
- Sunset City had less content than expected

Overal 9,5/10 for how i enjoyed the game.

My advise be picky with the DLC packs, not all give the content you like to play.
"
9732,Sheeeeeeeeesh
9733,"Cities: Skylines was fun game to play and experience as mayor to take over the control of city building. I learing a lot by playing this games. There are a lot of challenges are coming up when is the city is becoming larger and larger. To control all the resources is challenge. 

The game has a lot of variety of buildings and different types of buildings, each serve for their reason. Which creates a long path to compete with competitors."
9734,percfect for just chilling
9735,"This game starts off innocently. ""Oh lets build a city! Lets balance nice districts with the utilities to power the city!""

Then it throws traffic problems at you.
So you learn about road hierarchy, lane math, zoning techniques.
Then it throws balancing supply chain (a little) at you.
So you learn how to balance exports and its supply chain.
Then it shows you how your city could look SO much better.
So you do it all over again, this time on hardmode to design something that looks good as well.

10/10 would dump 1k hours learning about the world again."
9736,very good !!
9737,pretty good
9738,One of the best real-life simulators. Should be in High schools as a part of educational prog.

9740,Awesome concept to build your own city the way you want and go through the journey to develop it from a small town to a big city.
9741,mhm
9742,good
9743,Good game :)
9744,HOW TF DOES TRAFFIC WORK?
9745,"They Had a really great game here, but they just kept messing with it. It is almost unplayable now. Every city ends the same way. A random tsunami destroys everything no matter how much you put in it's way. Doesn't matter if random disasters are turned off. It does it every time."
9746,"Very addictive, fun to play!"
9747,yes

9762,"I have loved City builders since the original Sim City. I tried different things like cities XL (that had some great ideas) and was deeply disappointed by the sim city reboot.
And then came this game. It gave me a great City builders with things i always wished for. And each addon improves it even more. And if thats not enough, there is an amazing mod community.
Could there be improvements? Yes for sure. Sometimes i dont know why industries cry for recourses when there is a full warehouse right next to it. I also would love an actual season cycle.
But this is just behind Stellaris my most played game and catching up fast!
If you do like City Builders there is no competition right now"
9763,yes
9764,...
9765,I have always loved SimCity. This is all that and more.  Love the continued expansion packs and game play.
9766,Love playing this game just to pass by the time. The excitement of just first starting is thrilling and then seeing your city grow and adding more towns is just so rewarding.
9767,Way better than Sim City. A shame because I was a huge fan.
9768,Its very fun and Ive spent way to many hours playing.
9769,"You already own this game if this game is ""for you.""
If you aren't familiar with the paradox business model. the full game is $200, the $30 base game is a demo."
9770,I don't own this game
9771,"This game is good if you like management games and building games. Although, i would highly recommend mods as it makes the game play higher quality and has really helped out."
9772,this is a game where you buy and play for the rest of your life
9773,Great game
9774,Its good
9775,"Strangely addicting. I'm in college taking classes on urban planning right now and can't help but think about this game at least 3 hours a day, I think about it when I sleep, this is the weirdest game I have ever played and it is tattoo'd on my brain."
9776,zoning
9777,hg
9778,kinda fun
9779,"Excellent game with a lot of depth.  Makes you appreciate city planning and civil engineering IRL a lot more.  Overall a lot of content and value, worth the full price, but it's also on sale from time-to-time."
9780,øøøøøøøøøøøøøø
9781,"the controls were nearly impossible to use and aren't intuitive.  I've played simcity 3k and 2k and didn't thnk that was terribly hard to casually dabble and start in for comparison.  1.7 hrs later I still haven't figured out how to get water and electricity flowing to move on.  I've placed the items I was able to where it seems descriptions want you to, as well, and ran pipes from the shoreline and tanks to the residential zones, then laid down lines of transformers from the residental area to where the water is starting from. Ran out of money.  Maybe a tutorial would be good."
9782,"good game
"
9783,"after less than 17 hours i got to last milestone . 
my city is perfect except the traffic , which i feel is not my fault, 
so i don't see the point of keep playing this game ever again.

i guess its ok to buy only in a deep sale."
9784,Best game ever. I have no life.
9785,"A few bugs can make it annoying, like the death waves, having enough garbage transfer facitilies but still having garbage issues, and a few others, but in all, its a fantastic city sim game!"
9786,"I don't support changes to minimum spec requirements. Consumer protection and all that.

Make a new game if you have to start increasing it.."
9787,ow guys i love this game its so culm
9788,no
9789,Game is 100% recommended. I have played this a lot and the fact that they let you have the option between playing with everything completed like free play or taking the challenge of trying to build a city is really intuitive and great. My only con to the game is the amount of DLC items that could just be included in the base game.
9790,Legendary and addicting. The perfect game to play 12 hours straight.
9791,cool
9792,"After playing with all the toxic people on Overwatch, I love to play Cities: Skylines to zen out"

9808,"I was massively scared when I first saw my cousin play this game thinking this is not something I can ever pickup. But oh! how the tides turn. One of my absolute favorites now and if you are a city building enthusiast or even a simulation enthusiast, you will be missing out if you didn't try this out. 11/10 recommended."
9809,Nice game
9810,"I really love this game. Its a nice change game when you just want to chill from sims or shooting games with a cold one. I love to watch how the little people run and do their everyday life, and how the building rise up for being nothing. Very detailed game! 

One down side I notice how easy it is to make traffic jam. Somtimes I do not know how to figure it out and many times I have all school but yet many store or other workplace demand higher education. I often stumble on I lack on resource to my factory so my store suffer with it. I wish there was a mod in game that allowed to choose if you need more trucks and solve traffick jams. Like auto reset so the game solve my isse or give me a hint what to solve. If it need to place a road here or there if not just reset the cars/trucks. Im aware there is mods but somtimes there are things that should exist in games and might be some players dont know or cant download mods."
9811,its ight... I'd like to have more control over what I'm building
9812,I broke up with my girlfriend so I could play this more
9813,good
9814,Yes this is a million times better then sim city
9815,wahoo
9816,"I keep going back and fourth on this game. There is so much that it does right, but way more that I cannot stand about it. My major complaints: There is too much expensive DLC, You need mods to have a decent time. Traffic AI is abysmal. 
If you like city builders you SHOULD play this, but prepare for frustration."
9817,The steam workshop really adds a lot to this game
9818,.
9819,"The game is amazing. But I cannot recommend it in 2022. It is so poorly optimized, that by the time you get all of the mods/assets from the workshop that make the game still exciting to play all of these years later, the game runs so poorly that it is not enjoyable, and going back to an experience without mods or custom assets is not satisfying. If you buy this game in 2022, expect to enjoy it until you see the youtube videos and reddit posts of the amazing things you could do if you had a super computer."

9828,this game is very fun beacuse of the progression you have to make
9829,Best game :)
9830,"I have been playing this for years.  It's not SimCity, but it's as close as I'm going to get.  This game is so much fun."
9831,the traffic... oh god... the traffic...
9832,"Great game on it's own, but even better with mods.

You don't really need a lot of mods to make it a good game. Just look for Biffa's Top Ten Mods for Modding Beginners in the workshop under collections to start out. Don't click on the subscribe to all button though. You need to go to each mod's page as some of them have other required mods that aren't in Biffa's collection to work correctly. (edited for spelling)"

Almost all the most vital mods don't even require you to exit the game! Now thats pretty good 10/10 stars. I reccomend it to anyone who likes simulations, cities, city planning, and transportation."
9839,Fun game!

9867,"Unbearable amounts of really bad jokes and hashtags on ""chirper"" (twitter). Whoever came up with the idea of using twitter as a main feedback tool and a ""throwout joke dump"", ruined the game for me. Calling them dad jokes would be an insult to all legitimate dad jokes. A sim city clone doesn't need to be funny, so please stop trying.
Also the message variety is very limited. So limited, that after just 6 hours I've already seen the same messages dozens of times.
They just keep spamming the same 20-30 messages. While you could deactivate them, you'd have to constantly monitor each category to figure out what your citizens need.
Apart from this, it could be a good game, with minor flaws."
9868,yes

9870,A great single player city builder with amazing features and mechanics that make the game feel real and there's a lot to do in this game.

9906,A lot of fun!!
9907,"Great Game!!
I started out by playing the Default Set up where your given 60K and challenged to keep a  balanced budget & then create positive cash flow. Your shown all the expensive infrastructures you can buy years down the Road If you have the cash for them...(No Fun! (IMO)).
Personally [b]I LIKE[/b] the fact your able to Play the ""Long Game"" (Possible spoiler) [spoiler] go into the 'Content manager' Turn on unlimited budget"" & unlock all resources and buildings. You can go into debt but  you can also get yourself out of it on your terms[/spoiler]....Now the game is a blast to Play!! (challenge your self to Keep the sims happy, Control Traffic flow, keep sound and Noise pollution to min by using more efficient means of transpo , ETC, ETC
The Game is called  ""Cities Skylines""  NOT ""City Accountants"" (It takes a lot more than money to build a Successful City).  For example: It helps if you understand ""demographics"" and building placement. 
As for the price...Wait for a sale, buy the base game (which has a fair amount of content). Then buy the DLC's that Interest you.  that way the game is customized to build the city ""you"" want.  $60 in DLC's is a lot better than the alternative.  (I have yet to see ""ANY"" game that I would pay $123 for)."

9913,great game
9914,this is a very addictive game...
9915,yeah
9916,"This game is easily the best city builder ever made and the modding community is amazing. I will say that there's a lot of mods that get abandoned periodically that can mess with a city you've spent a ton of time on though, so acquaint yourself with how it works. It's not all too difficult and making sure you keep up with the major mods for possible issues or new version updates. Especially everytime they drop a DLC. Otherwise, whatever you want to do on this game; somebody has done it.

PS - Oddly the one thing I find lacking in the workshop however, is American sports arenas and stadiums"
9917,This is a really good city-builder and arguably the most popular one on the market. Very based on Sim-City but exceeds it in almost every way.

9923,"I love city building games and Cities Skylines is certainly up there amongst the best! I love the detail involved - in a love-hate way ;)

There are multiple DLCs to choose from that expand the base game no end. Plus, the CS community is always creating new, and exciting additions to incorporate via the Steam Workshop.

It's not hard to get lost in game for hours at a time, without realising just now long you've been playing. I'm expecting many, many more hours (years?) of great game play (only interrupted by having to go to pesky work!)"

9933,Best city builder
9934,"The game is GREAT.
The ONLY downside for me is the DLC freakfest...
Tons of DLC, you have to research which one is actually good and which one is bad. You must watch tons of videos and reviews saying exactly how each DLC impacts the game.
I mean, developers, publishers and all there are behind this great game, heed my call. Don't make it so hard to buy the game that it is easier to go pirate."
9935,"[South Carolina parents took 2-week-old baby to the hospital. What police found put them behind bars.

Two South Carolina parents who took their 2-week-old baby to the hospital are now facing charges.

According to the Sumter Police Department, Athena Elizabeth Hall, 18, and her husband Gustavo Miguel Martinez, 19, were charged Wednesday with unlawful neglect of a child.

Police say the couple brought the child to Prisma Health Tuomey Hospital on Jan. 25 after the baby began showing signs of physical distress.

The infant was transferred to a children’s hospital in Columbia for further treatment.

Officers say they were later notified that a medical specialist found bruising, brain hemorrhaging and other injuries, which led to the arrest of the parents.

The investigation is ongoing."
9936,It is a very fun and imaginative game. It was difficult and frustrating at first but i got the hang of it. Addictive and fun game :)

9944,"This is a Great game that I've had hours and hours of enjoyment. You can just let your imagination run wild in your city creations or even try to recreate the city you live in. It's one of those games that you spend hours on without even knowing, totally recommend it."
9945,yes
9946,"The amount of freedom and limitless city design possibilities
"
9947,very good very N I C E
9948,Muck
9949,"It is a good city builder, but I often get ahead of myself and get into a $500 deficit."
9950,.
9951,Racial segregation is amazing in this game. You have many options to lay out your concentration camps to further better the city. Would 100%% recommend !
9952,Good game
9953,y
9954,"Accidentally subscribed to a pack on the workshop, now i have 11,849 mods... 10/10"
9955,This game can cause time warp
9956,Love this game!
9957,Great Game
9958,"I created the perfect city, then destroyed it in a rage! 10/10"
9959,Greatest city-builder with a lot of mods from the community and great DLC's
9960,VERY GOOD
9961,good game
9962,Its fun
9963,Nice Game
9964,"Excellent Gameplay & Great Simulation of everything in the game. Ever since from the beginning one would easily feel as if they're the Mayor of a particular city with an aim. The City is living and one can easily tell by the looks of it. Me personally? Well I am still struggling to make a smooth flowing city as I've seen others have like on YouTube. 
One will have the ability to make a proper city with a good aim in mind, not all maps will support your goal of making a great metropolitan city. I'd recommend this game 99% to all gamers who love a simulation game. 
Keep one thing in mind, the game is tough to learn, it's not like make a few roads, zone some areas & Voila City is made, NAH! You really have to think and plan for your city to work. Therefore I believe the game should have had a Easy / Casual Mode for absolute starters just like there is a Hard Mode. I'd recommend a YouTube channel named ""City Planner Plays"" for absolute beginners as it helped me to understand various concepts of the game."
9965,I love it. Best cities builder game out there in my opinion
9966,"This is a great game , but it requires a lot from your computer and some mods can make it impossible to play, so be careful when choosing mods. The game is unique and wonderful to play and creat scenarios. Have fun!"
9967,fgfsgf fda
9968,Cool game
9969,This game has improved with time. The extra expansions give the game more options and interests. The graphics are good and the fact that you can build an amazing city with various mods at your disposal is a boon.  A multi-core (such as a 12-core) means you can build a city that is huge with smooth play. Highly Recommended.
9970,Very fun
9971,good
9972,"When I pressed the start button, I got a time machine."
9973,GOOD GAME
9974,man
9975,"Wash, rinse, repeat."
9976,The City is filled with smoke death  its all over
9977,pretty good
9978,"Can be as complex as you want, I enjoy just tending to a city."
9979,fun
9980,one of the best sim games i've ever played.
9981,"It's like Sim City but without any difficulty, so what you're really doing is designing a city slowly over time which is actually a lot of fun. 

Starwise I'd probably give it a 4/5  (note I've only played base so far) because a lot of the polish that you saw with a game like Sim City just isn't there. The music isn't as good, the graphics are less varied, the interface is worse. In some ways Sim-City 4 is a better looking game than this. I see opportunity for improvement everywhere, but it is fun."
9982,"Great game, can build 
"
9983,amazing!!!
9984,yes
9985,i love flooding cities with shit then making ambulances float away helplessly as their patients slowly choke on their turds from the pump
9986,"I would only recommend buying the game when it, and its dlc's are on sale. I say this because the base game is fine, however it feels more complete with some of the dlc's but the normal price for them is too high for some."
9987,I love this game. Its the greatest City building game ever made. Soo fun and alot of building options.
9988,"I wish there were a ""Utopia"" or ""Steady State"" mode almost where your system could be self-sufficient without needing growth, but maybe I'm just not good enough at doing that"

9993,p
9994,"sometimes i go bankrupt and i dont even have a single person in my town, other times i nuke them with natural disasters that are far from natural. The classic Cities skyllines experience is no building towns, but its more of a torture simulator so you can drown people in not water, but their own waste. This is more than a game. It's a way to torture innocent people without doing as much as waiting a couple seconds."
9995,"This game is a amazing experience for new and old players. I recommend you buy this game, But they're DLCS that are quite expensive other than that this game is good."
9996,Nice way to chill
9997,Cities: Skylines is hands down the best city builder to date. I have come back to this game time and time again for years. I have yet to find anything similar that is as fun. I only wish they would come out with a new version!
9998,Bought this game and a bunch of DLC's.   Game crashes on load.  Despite contacting Support I've heard nothing from them.   I would have recommended this game in the past but not anymore.
9999,"Spent around 2 hours building a city, and the game crashed when I went to save."
10000,"If being a mayor means having to deal with angry citizens, I would say no thanks! 😆"
10001,"really good if you love spending hours fixing traffic jams and decorating a park. its deffinitly not for everyone, but i love it"
10002,city
10003,in simple words: best city simulater game
10004,its way to laggy even on all low setings this game could be optamized by alot
10005,pretty lit like a city
10006,"It is very good. I play it with my gf. She takes care of the parks, and I build efficient infrastructure."
10007,yes
10008,"Games getting DLC farmed. Paradox does this a lot. Scummy company, but good game."
10009,Love it.
10010,E
10011,perfect city building game
10012,Great city builder with tons of options and nice map size.
10013,"The game is good but if u like action games this game is not for u 
7/10"
10014,aswome i lov it it amazing
10015,"This is kind of like Sim City, but just.. some reason... Sim City was more fun.

However, EA owns Sim City now.. So, buy this and it wont be trash."
10016,ibjk
10017,Fantastic!
10018,shitty skylines
10019,good game
10020,ITS A GOOD GAME TO PLAY
10021,"emmmmmmmm,我是个垃圾市长"
10022,"It is really good, but the DLC's are really expencive and some aren't even that good.
I reccomend it.
"
10023,Good.
10024,What a thrill of a game - create a masterpiece of a city and then send tsunamis and tornadoes to ruin it all
10025,"Is a really good game, I like building entire continents but not a lot of games are good at this but this game hat this and a lot of other things I really recommend this game"
10026,Amazing city building game!
10027,Great game very nice
10028,16161615861615861685684184
10029,"Shit game, they dont give you enough money at the start and make everything very hard to understand, when you run out of money and dont have the correct sewage, water, power set up you have to restart the game. It looked really fun to play but its not beginner friendly and i dont feel like watching hours of tutorials just to start a city."
10030,.
10031,"Out of all my games I always seem to come back to this one. I lose countless of hours playing Cities Skylines, it's fun and rewarding to watch your tiny towns form into massive cities over time. 10/10
"
10032,A fun city builder that allows for customization in maps and buildings.
10033,I deleted this it's very complex to build your city
10034,"I am a veteran of Sim City 2000, Sim City 3000, and Sim City 4 and all that I can say, this game is a decent city simulation. I am still struggle to play it, because somehow It not as easy as Sim City that I remember. 

Pro:
- Modern graphic
- Details

Cons:
- The gameplay, It not easy to adapt from similar games that I used to play lol

Final Score for now: 3/5"
10035,"Pretty Fun, played bfr in ps4 
worth it
Cool workshop
many DLC
didn't find any bugs
10/10"
10036,"Relaxing, lots of content"

10039,"HELT SJUKT nerdespill, men meget morro"
10040,"At first, I was anxious to buy because I didn't think I'd play it/like it, but now it's one of my favorite games."
10041,pagman
10042,h o u s e s
10043,seedeez
10044,yes
10045,"Good game, better than simcity but higher hardware requirement needed when city grows big"
10046,U can build a city in ur own image!
10047,Cities:? yes Skylines? yes.
10048,idk but pretty nice
10049,dx
10050,Absolute addictive and maybe the best city building games out there. The mods and DLCs also add so much to the game. However I wish the game would have been more optimized for modern machines maybe if they make a Cities Skylines 2
10051,"yes
"
10052,10/10 bulldoze residents if they misbehave
10053,it gud but steep learning curve
10054,"At last,some education for my little brother how to manage a city and become a city/building planner soon..
just reinstall because i just upgraded my pc.."
10055,The best City Builder ever.
10056,Its what Sim City has always wanted to be
10057,yea
10058,I like flooding the world with sewage and shi*ts
10059,"Simply put, what Sim City 5 should (would?) have been if EA had decided to not dump SC down the mobile drain. CS (funny, no?) is way more detailed, there's super fun micro-managing all over the place for all OCD'ers and planners out there, it's wide open to the modding community and it's beautiful.

Oh and it's still getting relevant NEW DLC!!

It's just... fun. Get it now!"
10060,"City Skylines is a good city builder, don't get me wrong, but the space that is given to you at the maximum limit is tiny and would maybe get you to 100,000 citizens if you build enough. Though, there are mods that greatly extend the size of the maps, everything else about the game is great. From dealing with noise pollution and pollution in general and making sure that the city is clean (or not), and if you citizens do get sick, send them to the hospitals and then the cemetery. Try to build Seoul? Or New York City? You can try, but don't except the population to get to that with the base game, mods would have to help with that. I truly think this the top tier city builder game I have played. The only complaint I have of this game is that it doesn't have seasonal weather climate and would have to BUY a DLC to see snow maps."
10061,I Love This Game. But So Much DLC
10062,
10063,Does fun things
10064,The game is a fun way to be creative. I love the DLCs and the huge library of Mods that can be added to the game. It makes the game feel endless.
10065,s
10066,"This game definetly not for me. I dont understand how traffic works nor how to make those crazy fly-over thing. My father is a contractor and architect, so i know some construction knowledge and city planning from him. But those traffic, road and such thing like that confused me. This game is really technical. But if you still love city builder/manager like this, you can search other more simple game or learn some basic for this game in the tutorial and in Steam Community Guide. 
I give thumb up for this game because of its complexity. I hope they just dont add more DLC or just make them into bundle. smh."
10067,"It is not a game for everyone, maybe you need to like puzzles o be willing to spend a lot of time learning how to play properly. Once you are into into it, it pays pack and feels fully worthy."
10068,I'm addicted. Help lol
10069,Really fun game i would recommend 10/10
10070,"Amazing
"
10071,fun
10072,game go brrr
10073,yes
10074,Great game! Very relaxing
10075,"i love it, my fave"
10076,"If you like simulator, want to make ur own city then its for you"
10077,"Its Great :)
"
10078,"yes very good, very fun"
10079,BEST SINGLE PLAYER GAME EVER!
10080,city build game fun!
10081,"If you like city sims, you will like Cities: Skylines."
10082,I love it.
10083,Best City Builder SO FAR.
10084,One of the best city planning game that I had ever play so far that I had to stopped playing for some time. The fun and addiction of this game keep me procrastinate from doing other real life things.
10085,"If you loved sim city, say no more this game is for you!"
10086,100 hours playing this game and then suddenly get fps drop and game crash. so meh for me
10087,"fun game, don't have any of the dlcs to increase play but still fun"
10088,ROADS
10089,Decent Game with a lot of nice DLC's
10090,"City skylines is great, although there are expensive DLCS you can do so much with the vanilla game."
10091,great game! Worth it!
10092,Excellent City Building Simulator! Even easier to handle compared to SimCity.
10093,Endless fun.
10094,It is very exciting game
10095,Nice and calming... then they gonna say taxes are too hig... 14%???? we got 21% here IRL!
10096,Time flies by =)
10097,download it
10098,Amazing game. The workshop mods make it a million times better
10099,"Best city builder game, but it feels unfinished without any mods or DLC tho."
10100,Very entertaining forsenE
10101,.
10102,"Just so fucking broken, incredibly frustrating, and you need to use a countless number of mods just to make the game playable.

ALSO HOW FUCKING HARD IS IT TO MERGE WHAT THE FUCK MERGE LIKE A FUCKING ZIP DON'T STOP IN THE MIDDLE OF THE ROAD AND CLOG UP THE WHOLE HIGHWAY YOU DON'T EVEN NEED TO BE IN THE LEFT LANE JUST BE A NORMAL DRIVER AAAHHHHHHHHH

Also one extra fuck you to the game because it's fucking horrible and I hate it"
10103,Timelessly replayable.
10104,This game will suck you in with all the details you could ever hope to be involved with and in.  It is the ultimate cities management game.
10105,"I love it, but very hate it."
10106,Veri funni
10107,"If you can manage this game flawlessly, you can become prime minister :D"
10108,good
10109,Best memories from the game like this(simcity) but this...this is even better than simcity hope to make more memories with it
10110,"Great city game! I really like playing it in my spare time! It's annoying that it wants me to keep some of my population dumb, but they'll have to suffer through my prioritization of education."
10111,good
10112,amazing
10113,love how intuitive this game is and detailed with all the inner workings of city building.
10114,"I was excited to purchase the game on the initial screen, but nowhere, NOWHERE on the store page does it say anything about having to sign up for the services in order to play the game. How many accounts to I have to have to play a simple game? And how many companies is my personal data going to be sold to? The company says I have the right to object, and that I most certainly do. I will not be creating an account, and I will be uninstalling the game. And Steam, I would appreciate a refund while I'm at it."
10115,best gameeee
10116,Like this game so much I have it on ps4 and pc
10117,"I like the use of mods in this game, just learning how to use them at the moment and watch Youtube videos as well, its very relaxing , I would recommend this to friends , haven't bought all the DLC's yet but slowly working at it"
10118,"I started this game empty minded, however, after hours of work I have a big city. Despite time taken, it is a proud accomplishment to run a successful city. I recommend this game to those who have time and are willing to commit to learn techniques on running a city on a digital device."
10119,Just a fun relaxing city builder game. I end up spending a fair bit of the time working on transit and roads but still good. Definitely worth a buy.
10120,"paradox until you guys fix you S****t update i will not recommend this game to anyone that looking to play beyond your bar-bone base game and DLC that cost 140+$, you treat people that spend so much money on your game like S**** because they ask you to fix your update that broke the game for anyone that's using mods, which is necessary if you want to enjoy this bar-bones game Fix your S****** and maybe i will change it 


""Banned because I asked how to roll back the games latest update because it's broken wow
so this is how they are doing things you ask a question about how to roll back the update and you get banned, I said something about I guess piracy is the only way to roll back the game it's not like I was going to do it but even if I did I own 98% of all the DLC and the base game but this is how yo treat your consumers GTFO""


7/6/22 Edit the game has become stable so it's now ok, even though {aradox F*******ed everything up before"
10121,"Great game, there are some drawbacks if you want to play like a realistic urban planner, but I think those drawbacks improve the game because it gives the player more control and therefore more fun. Also I think the amount of people that can fit into public transit vehicles should be looked at again. Also the community is great and very active."
10122,The scenery is spectacular and the ai blows me away.
10123,yes
10124,some citizen complained about about there being no fire department so i demolished his house to put a fire department
10125,Absolute banger of a game.
10126,"it has a learning curve, but once you start it kinda gets better, i have a very smol city so idk, someday i will understand metro stations uwu"
10127,Is good game. 10/10
10128,Great game overall. Awsome simulations of in real world stuff.
10129,Love it
10130,"I love the game so these ""Complaints"" I'm listing are more frustrations with the human condition, which is greatly exemplified in Cities: Skylines!

1. IF I TRY TO BE ECO FRIENDLY AND DO FARMING INDUSTRIES AND LOGGING INDUSTRIES, THE STUPID CITIZENS COMPLAIN THAT I'M GONNA PUT WAGONS OUT AND IGNORE THE FACT THAT I LITERALLY HAVE A MONORAIL.
2. Even if you put down a bunch of transportation services that makes Cities in Motion look like a small bus company, THEY STILL USE THEIR CARS
3. WHY ARE THERE DORMS IN THE COMMUNITY COLLEGE WHO'S GOING TO A COMMUNITY COLLEGE AND LIVE IN COMMUNAL HOUSING!?!
4. HAVE Y'ALL EVER HEARD OF MAKING A DETOUR IF TRAFFIC IS BAD?!
5. QUIT NOT DYING I NEED 8 CEMETERIES FILLED SO I CAN MAKE A DISTRICT DEDICATED TO TRAINS
6. WHY CAN'T I ORDER HITS ON CITIZENS FOR USING TWITTER?
Some people may complain the game's unrealistic, but this game is a true testament to the human condition. Also, Highly recommend getting the industries, mass transit, and Campus DLCs at least. It's a fun game, and while frustrating, you have a lot more control than you realize!"
10131,"have the game for 4 days. played 14 hours already. Very addictive..Have to set goals everytime you log in I think. This helps you finish your session earlier, than going untill you feel like stopping. Then you'll be going for hours on end. Good game tho. Bought only the best DLC. Bought everything for now on sale. Mods are amazing. You can make the game actually complete.
This is my first review ever hehehe"
10132,"great game
"
10133,"Amezing game. Many people just look at it as a city building game. But there is a lot of complicated programming, such as optimizing the game to handle millions of pedestrians and cars and everything, Car pathfinding, city simulations and a lot of more things. Its crazy how a game like this exist. For only 20$ this is a must have game, and its often on sale for 5$. Its crazy how cheap they price this game, I would buy it for 50$. Its sad to see how other low quality and rushed games like fifa has the rights to price their game for 60$, their game doesn't have any super technical stuff in them."
10134,Very good game
10135,this is one of the best games ever
10136,At first it might be hard but if you read some guides and follow in-game tips then you'll be golden soon with your own amazing city!
10137,Fun game but costly lol
10138,good
10139,I like that it makes me think and challenges me to look outside the box. Its a fun game and you do need to have a little creativity with it.
10140,P
10141,"Soo addicting, no doubt about it.
I really like the mod-ability to this game which allows for people to do many things such as get more buses, traffic management systems etc.
It is really helpful to know that you got a whole lot of people who are willing to help your city building experience.
I have had this game since 2019/2018.

Definitely the type of game I would love for more people to enjoy."
10142,"I'm still kind of a n00b, but I love it"
10143,Fun game to just build and relax in. Only annoying thing is that the game gets boring quick without most of the DLCS.
10144,yes
10145,nice
10146,i like mass destruction
10147,Mayor Batman
10148,A really in depth city builder for someone that's pretty much done with sim city. If you like games like roller coaster tycoon or sim city you'll love this and the in depth options it offers!
10149,"It's really pay-to-save-your-citizens. Normal things like evac shelters, radio towers, natural disasters, less traffic at night, more mods, and skins really cost 250 USD. Otherwise, it's a good game. I'm just really mad."
10150,b
10151,"Bought this game at 2015, me a veteran SFC simcity player scared by the curvee road, revisit this game 7 years later and found I finally overcome the curvee-road phobia"
10152,Can play this game 2 days continously
10153,yeah
10154,Customizability and non-EA-ness of it makes it the best city sim to-date.
10155,"its magnificent, amazing graphics and gameplay."
10156,the piece of sh*t paradox launcher will not install on my computer for absolutely no reason. don't waste your money on this f***ing piece of sh*t
10157,its fun
10158,Ive struggled to get into it. I have found there is little tutorials and quiet boring. Im also annoyed that only about a week after i brought it it went down in price alot! wish i didnt waste my money its not worth it.
10159,Ohhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh
10160,Fun and relaxing
10161,:)
10162,"Fun game. Well worth it for the price. Especially when it goes on sale <$10. 

The controls seem finicky when you start out, but you get used to it quick. 

The workshop has a ton of great free add ons as well."
10163,"Cities skylines is a very good game, in the beginning it can be hard but After a few times you understand everything. The graphics are very detailed. This is a must play game, you can do so much and it is very fun to see your city grow big. I did play this so much the first half year that I have it (a little bit to much). After a time I had the problem that I did know everything to well and so there was no challange anymore(so I stopped playing). This game is worth the price (buy it if there is a sale or ask it for your birthday) One tip you can set unlimited money on. I would rate this game 8/10 because it has everything and nothing misses."
10164,Its good
10165,Great city manager simulator.
10166,Underrated little gem.
10167,"very good game
"
10168,Great city builder! You can spend hours doing all sorts of interesting things and that's before you look at the steam workshop!
10169,bruh
10170,"its very good
"
10171,add sex dlc
10172,not only do you need steam launcher and login you now also need paradox launcher and login. plus all the microtransactions.... avoid and wait for a new city sim to come.
10173,Hitler is in my top 3 Austrians
10174,"I've played over 400 hours. It's not perfect, it's not Sim City, but it's fun and it's the best city simulation at the moment."
10175,"Skylines is well-made-- the performance is smooth, it looks nice, the interface is solid, and there are lots of great mods. 

But I can't help but feel that fundamentally, it's not exactly a city planner -- it's a 1950s-style traffic simulator. 

Skylines is built to emulate cities like Dallas, with major highways and a good amount of residential and industrial sprawl, but obviously not all cities look like Dallas. There are no bike lanes, beach areas, pedestrian shopping areas, cobblestone streets, dirt roads, slums, exclusive neighborhoods, ancient districts, or other facets of major cities in every continent on Earth. Car accidents and violent crimes are nonexistent. Residents are easy to please, and most of the time money will pour in effortlessly. Your performance as a mayor/designer will never be at risk.

Without all of this complexity, the only remaining challenge is to design massive road networks to avoid persistent traffic issues. Even six-lane one-way Soviet-style boulevards and extensive metro systems won't do much to appease the hordes of cars that flood into the city for whatever reason. 

It's an impressive game in many ways, but it should be called City Highways instead."
10176,city
10177,right on! exquisite mouth feel
10178,"its fun
"
10179,amazing game
10180,i palyed tis game on xnox then ps and now pc
10181,"If you like Sim City, this game takes it to the next level. With good graphics and multitude of budgeting/management you will spend hours and hours building and perfecting your city. Then there's tons of mods that make this game even more fun and interesting. You can literally build Dubai using assets from the mod if you wanted! of course achievements will be disabled but that's just a small price to pay for salvation."
10182,fun game i like
10183,Not Bad.
10184,fun
10185,One of the best Simulation games on the market.
10186,pretty fun
10187,yep
10188,fun
10189,"Not a review - but, why does my Cities: Skylines keep crashing? I've tried everything. Any tips? Suggestions?
"
10190,New player and I just hit 100 hours. This game is SO EFFING DOPE!!! My mind is completely blown at how detailed this game is-it's a bit overwhelming in a good way. I look forward to getting the mechanics and building more creatively than just a grid that I can barely keep in line half the time. I look forward to  many THOUSANDS of hours playing this and hopefully getting the major DLCS I'm missing. I can't recommend this game enough and if I dare say it is the best game I have ever played...that's saying a lot.
10191,good game
10192,Great game. What Sim City should have been.
10193,Absolutely! One of the best games on Steam! Absolutely GOATed game! Cannot say enough great things about this game. The ability to create your own city from scratch and run it the way you see fit is addicting and provides endless hours of gameplay.
10194,I love this game
10195,I love this game. It took me a minute after playing simcity. but once I got to know this game I like it alot more than simcity. I like that the city can grow up in simcity and you can build mega towers but the detail that goes into this game. I feel like there is more you can do with this game.
10196,Lego City DLC when?
10197,good game to relax and chill on :3
10198,"a primeira impressão foi péssima, não vi nenhum sistema de ""aconselhamento"" no jogo como havia em games do mesmo nicho, também não há o desenvolvimento da cidade tudo depende do ""planejador"""
10199,"If you like easy sandbox builders you'll love this. Money management is a key factor, but once you watch a few YouTube videos and practice, it comes very easy. 100% worth it and the DLC's are awesome. Make designing and decorating your city very easy and the level of detail is awesome as well."
10200,=
10201,"Addicting as hell, reminds me of playing SimCity as a young millenial child with no life or friends."
10202,57
10203,"Great city builder simulation! There's a bit of a learning curve (although I think that's true with most games) and is probably not worth full price, so might be worth waiting for a sale, but it's a great game either way!"
10204,the game is super fun once you understand what your doing. so if you like in depth simulator games then this is a super good one
10205,ive always loved city builder games since study hall in highschool playing simcity.  city skylines is exactly what i expected simcity to be in 2020
10206,"For a game challenging best city builder, this must work on your learning curve and new players support. 
"
10207,"EXTREMELY greedy with DLC, be aware that you're purchasing an incomplete game and will need to spend hundreds in order to get all the developer-created content. Trying to use mods and custom assets instead? Good luck with the game actually launching or taking 30 minutes or less to launch even with a 1TB SSD."
10208,"It is an okay game until you put your first pedestrian overpass and watch your cims flock to your creation with their tiny arms and legs, huffing and puffing, walking kilometers at a time to and fro their destination. Then it becomes dear to you. But mostly, game is all about intersections and roundabouts."
10209,"cul gae i build nagsaci and use metor on midle like nuke like america in 1845 when ww2 was is
"
10210,One of my top games of all time. The years of dedication and support that this game has received is amazing. 7 years later and I'm still excited to see the latest DLC and start a new city.
10211,All I've learned from this game is that I should never be a city planner.
10212,Doesn't load saved games.. useless..
10213,very relaxing and cool
10214,"As you can see, I have played this game a lot. The gameplay is good, but with mods its amazing. I do wish the base game had more to it, such as improved public transport."
10215,"i made my city drink poop water 
"
10216,"we are living in 2022, this game has 2560x1440 resolution in it's settings yet all the game's UI, Texts and whole Menus does not scale up to ""1440p"", therefore looking at 1080p blurry texts given me headache after 9min. and looking around at internet for solution turn up to be this problem in game for YEARS!, i had do refund whole dlc pack because it is pretty much unplayable. (and no player created mod does not make up for it.)"
10217,super
10218,good
10219,yes
10220,"I recommend this game to other however for me, this game crashes every 30-40 minutes and its very frustrating. It was a little difficult starting the game, the tutorials were very dry a at explaining things. I had to search up an explainer video on you tube to start the game. However the game is very fun."
10221,"When Cities Skylines 2 ?

You killed Sim city / Maxis EA(Good riddance) so time to step up or see the same fate."
10222,"its good
"
10223,"Para mentri bersi keras untuk tidak AFK agar negeri ini makmur sentosa
"
10224,you can make a poop bowl
10225,"Took me two hours to figure out if the game was worth dumping 52 bucks into, considering I got SimCity Elevety-Hundred for 3 monopoly bucks, I'm happy to say: the game is indeed worth 17.3~ times the price of SimCity."
10226,Great game
10227,A good and fun city builder.
10228,"i absolutely love this game, i enjoy the aspect of planning out major transport lines the most"
10229,Not liking the city and restarting simulator
10230,city
10231,sd
10232,"This game is amazing. It has the best city-building experience out of any game I played. The cities feel alive and real and the game can be played pretty much however you like! The game is very well made and is polished beyond belief. Most of the DLC is worth it as well! Overall this is the best city-building game out there right now, no other game even come's close.
Highly recommended!"
10233,.
10234,For Trains The doors could open But Its So Good
10235,"Great game but gets boring quickly without mods. Needs a decent pc to run but even with a medium range pc can still crash. Otherwise, great scenery and the satisfaction after building up a good looking city is great."
10236,super good
10237,"You know that city where all traffic is underground and people only walk and bike above ground?
Build that.

You know that Chernovyll (or whatever it is spelled)?
Build that.

You know that shitty traffic jam you have... everywhere?
Don't build that. Seriously. It will fuck up your life."
10238,"It's such a deal!
"
10239,i like it
10240,Its a very fun game if you like city archutecture games
10241,"Extremely addictive. I honestly have only played city sims pretty passively in the past. But this game made me love every aspect of managing a city. You really end up building more of a region or area with several towns, and it's been a blast setting up districts and taxing each differently. Absolutely recommend if you love city sims.

The DLCs only make this game better, but I would wait for a good sale as they're usually 50% off. Skip all the content creator packs (unless you make content), and just grab the main ones such as Industries, Mass Transit, Green Cities, & After Hours. Campuses, Concerts, & Snowfall are just fun to mix things up every once and awhile."
10242,one of the best games
10243,Best city-builder game ever!
10244,good game
10245,"Best city builder you can find, new DLC still being added years later"
10246,My bf gave this to me because he thought I would like it and he was right. 8.5/10 wish it didn't take up so much space and wish citizens were more interactive but those are my only complaints!
10247,"""Toto, I've got a feeling we're not in Kansas anymore."""
10248,me like build city
10249,Game is great but DLC are too price.. always wait for reduction... game price is the same as dlc...
10250,yes
10251,"very good, building cities is cool."
10252,bad natural disasters
10253,U build stuff
10254,GG indeed
10255,Love this game. it can be very challenging at times which is great nd love all of the mods and creator content.
10256,"Amazing city simulation! Everything Sim City had aspired to be. Holds up well in 2022, although some DLC content should just be base game. In CS:2 needs to improve traffic AI, include more building themes base game, and a multiplayer functionality. Obviously would be hopeful for performance improvements  as well."
10257,"Accidentally left on so Steam (bot) won't refund. It crashes and is not intuitive. Terrible game, but stuck with it."
10258,yes
10259,"was a fun 5 hours, no motivation to continue tho
"
10260,e
10261,"This is what SimCity should have been. Simply, the best city builder so far, with great support for modders and a lot of fun for all fans of the genre."
10262,"bruh bruuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuu
"
10263,My mom said it's pretty good
10264,tight af d-_-b
10265,Sim city but good
10266,e
10267,"Pros: Mods work, your the mayor. Different Radio Types help with the Vibe.

Cons: City Planning, you have to think and plan your ideal city,

All around: Great City Game. You will lose a ton on time planning."
10268,"Its THE City building game. Awesome developer and nice mod community.
Requires you to invest in DLCs tho, so keep that in mind."
10269,"I used to love this game, its a relaxing city sim but Paradox did its Paradox DLC politics.

The DLCs are everywhere now, some Old features got removed and placed into new DLC which they want you now to buy for over 250€ total so far.

What even is more worse, old Mods dont work anymore cause they brought features into the game for free that, you guessed it, you have to buy now as an DLC.

I wanted to load some old maps of mine and i cant, because now i need a DLC for that, which was no problem 5 years prior till now.

Horrible."
10270,nice
10271,the ultimate city builder
10272,I once played this game for 14 hrs straight and felt like only 40 mins passed. Truly an immersive game and probably my current favourite of em all!.
10273,it's the true successor to simcity 4.
10274,fun for all ages
10275,i had dreams about this game
10276,Fun and addictive! Just remember to bring a lot of patience. Rome wasn't built in a day and neither will your city (probably).
10277,I once played this game for 48 hours straight. This game slaps.
10278,"$230 of DLC. Options are still in game and grayed-out so that you know what you are missing, and some of them are features critical to the core gameplay. The same story with Planet Zoo and Stellaris, two other Paradox games. 

This company, Paradox, really needs to re-evaluate their DLC structure. At least other games that did this in the past were subscription-based, so you knew what you were getting into. The pattern is that this company releases a bare-bones game with a lot of potential, then releases updates that completely change the way that the game works, then keep adding expensive DLC to utilize the core changes in gameplay that they have implemented through updates. This means that when the game updates, you are suddenly faced with scenarios and are put in situations that would necessitate the new features, which are behind paywalls that they constantly advertise to you in-game. And this happens over and over again, year after year, for nearly all of their games."
10279,"it is good 
game
"
10280,its alright
10281,"A very good game in which you can make a city designed for profit, a city designed for realism or the city of your dreams. Highly recommend for anyone who likes SimCity or any Simulation game. If you have the space, i recommend getting assets and mods from the workshop to improve your game experience."
10282,"If you want to build yourself a city, this is the place"
10283,If you want a calm relaxing game to just let your creativity flow just buy now.
10284,Great game the true successor to  Sim City
10285,":D
"
10286,"If you like SimCity, you will love this one. It starts with building a city, but quickly transitions to managing roads to keep traffic flowing."
10287,Constantly crashes or doesn't get past the load screen.
10288,Fun
10289,Very good stuff
10290,gotta first person mod and im thriving
10291,good
10292,I love this game!
10293,Great building game. Choose what to build in the way you want to build it.
10294,Addicting.
10295,Nice!!!!
10296,"Top game, unfortunately you cant kill kids. 8/10"
10297,"Traffic jam, polution, and disaster."
10298,It's that game you wanted to play for 20 years and didn't know it.
10299,top
10300,Amazing Game!
10301,Not for now
10302,Probably the best City Sim out there
10303,Good simulator!
10304,This game sucks up your soul and leaves you stranded in a timless loop of city management.
10305,"ketika bermain applikasi city skyline stuck ketika aplikasi dijalankan 5 menit pertama dan kemudian aplikasi close, perlu diketahui saya menggunakan OS windows 10 pro 20h2 version, ram 16 Gb, Cpu ryzen 2600, 1060 gtx 6 Gb. mengapa terjadi crash saat ingin memilih load game and new game? ada solusi? terimakasih."
10306,"Most games are about fighting, killing, defeating an enemy, destroying something. Few games offer you the chance to build something. This game really shines when you begin to flex your creative muscles and lean in to the design aspects of it. Getting the DLC and playing with mods is almost a necessity for me. I can't imagine sticking with it for long without the extra features and assets the workshop provides. It allows you to build your dream city, or recreate your hometown block by block. It's a great form of escapism/wish fulfillment."
10307,Best city builder ever made
10308,i like this game
10309,"Before I played Cities: Skylines, I had a small penis, no friends, no girlfriend, depression, and absolutely no life. These things haven't changed, but the game is pretty good."

Epic game. Really fun but kinda expensive considering the DLCs. Got it for 7 bucks on sale and am very happy with my purchase."
10312,"Best game ever FNR_Gaming 99/100
Though if you have ok Pc iw old recomend playing vinilla version"
10313,ya
10314,Great for creativity
10315,You'll be absorbed into hours and hours of designing and micro-managing your prefect city.
10316,"I checked the time and it was 7am, i started playing at 3pm"
10317,fun but hard cause im dumb
10318,too hard to play
10319,It was ok...
10320,Great!
10321,"Love it, a great  load of dopamin with this sandbox game! Designs are very well made, this is a time consuming pearl!"
10322,This used too be fun when there was only a couple dlc and they were cool  but now all the dlc even when on sale is over 140$ and the dlc content is shown to you when you play the game. it outways the main content by a lot so I can not recommend this game
10323,yes
10324,"Good
"
10325,"The good: I've played this game a LOT on Xbox, and it's how I found the game originally. I love this game a lot, it's smooth and works well to build your city, but not have to pay tons of attention to it all the time when you need to walk away - it has a lot of replay value and tons of unlockables that encourage experimentation with the different city types.
The bad: many of the best parts of the game are behind DLC paywall, but the majority of the base game will give you the gist of what you're getting yourself into. I also, by comparison of the Xbox version, dislike not being able to see my resource locations to better and more effectively plan my city from the beginning of starting a new map the way you can on xbox. 
If you're into city planning SIMS and other like games I would definitely tell you to add this to your game list."
10326,penis'
10327,gud game its peaceful and chills me out
10328,"i enjoy this game, i would rate it five outta six cities."
10329,Best sim game probably ever... Been playing on console for years and recently PC which is a little better.
10330,i just wanted to say its a good game but apparently i have to write that out in a long form as well to verify i meant it
10331,"All the fun of optimizing a city like sim city, but with much much more fidelity in zoning, planning, etc. I really like that you are just a city planner, albeit with a bit more power (I will redirect the interstate wherever I WANT HAHAHA)"
10332,"this game woundt open butt cheekers
"
10333,"It is very satisfying, and the mechanics of the game work well. The only thing is that you need a decent PC especially when you build larger cities."
10334,This is definitely one of the better playing and better looking tycoon games out there. The natural disasters expansion is clearly an afterthought and isn't worth your time.
10335,It's a great game!
10336,Best game ever!
10337,"the game turned really unstable after the airports update..it crashes 90% of the time.. i would  wait a bit before buying this game.
-edit- the game is actually fixed and very fun! would play again. But why do we need to buy dlcs to normally play the game?"
10338,"amazing game omg, had to watch some youtube vidoes before i got in the groove but i love it!"
10339,who would have thought that civil engineering would be so fun.
10340,just a good game
10341,"Amazing Game !!
"
10342,"If you like planning, building, and modifying a city as it grows, this game is for you. Insta-pleasure when you detail your cities making them come to life. Love this game."
10343,"Cities Skylines is a great, well-done game! I love the fact that you are free to design and manage your own city despite not having DLCs! I also find that the workshop adds a great deal to the game - not only including the community but improving the game! To add to this, I love the regular flow of new DLCs and updates adding new content to the game!"
10344,lol
10345,"Its a very good game, you can be creative, and its not a game that becomes boring after some time! AMAZING game!!!"
10346,I love urbanization

10351,"GAME GAMPANG
THANKS YT.VENTAZEL !!"
10352,good
10353,"this game super fun and super dedicated mod community. honestly the support is amazing defintely buy when on sale but probs not for full price
10/10"
10354,I'm still a novice - I'll let you know... :)
10355,"Extremely Laggy unless you install multiple 3rd party patches because it runs on a very old unity system. Overpriced in my opinion, I got it on sale for 6.99 euros but I wouldn't see myself paying full price for it. It is a good game don't get me wrong but badly optimized and a bit overpriced."
10356,"Ok, so I can understand going to other places (discussion boards, youtube, etc) to find out how to do some of the advanced stuff.  However, when the in game tutorials are absolutely useless in attempting to understand the basics of the game, it makes me want to quit the game immediately.  I was unable to do much of anything before I realized I was stuck and I had no idea what to do next.  No tutorials that helped, no progress in the game, just twiddling my thumbs as there was nothing to do."
10357,best city builder game of all time
10358,"it is fun to manage a city, however the dlcs are quite expensive"
10359,noice
10360,It's the ultimate city building game!
10361,yes
10362,loading the game is taking hours!!! gave up playing most of the time during the waiting! This is the problem never been solved and add to more problem in every update!
10363,나만의 도시를 건설해본다는 아이디어가 참신했고 게임플레이도 재미있었다.
10364,"Good, but shoutout to Paradox for flooding the game with unneeded features that add basically nothing to the core game experience."
10365,"You want to go to New York? No problem. Build it by your own.
I forgot. Buy first Airport DLC because New York is too far."
10366,can you guys please fix this game where you can play with a xbox one controller i did buy this game on switch it is fun
10367,Very chill
10368,Great vanilla gameplay but with mods like TrafficManagement allows for near complete control over worlds
10369,Yes
10370,"very good game with good graphics, although the loading is quite long for me but overall very solid game"
10371,"It's very complex, has many interesting options. On console i have version with 10 dlc's, its even better:) Also good sales
"
10372,cimpty
10373,"very good 
"
10374,It's alright i guess
10375,FEATURED DLC
10376,the graphic is not good its so bad
10377,it's grrrrrrreat!
10378,"The depth of this city sim is outstanding. Recommend getting a couple mods for ease of road building but otherwise it has a lot to offer even in the vanilla game. Running bus lines, metro lines, electrical needs, water lines, park building, it just has it all especially if you start adding expansions which allow for more custom versions of what the game already offers (custom upgradable parks with parks exp, custom airports with airports exp, custom industries with industries exp, etc. etc). Worth checking isthereanydeal I ended up paying the normal cost but got like 5 expansions from finding a deal."
10379,"it is a simulator, an excellent one"
10380,Perfect game
10381,"Cities Skylines: The best game in 1 million years

Have alot of fun with it and its much better then on ps4"
10385,amazing game to play to kill time!
10386,wonderfull city building simulation
10387,"I originally started playing this game on xbox about yr ago, and I have discovered the PC version is waaay better. It can be a little time consuming at first learning everything, but once you get the hang of it (and you will pretty quickly) there is so much you can build/do with your city!"
10388,Waiting for CS2
10389,ye
10390,10/10 would skyline again.
10391,This is a game I keep coming back to because of the challenges it offers. I also enjoy the reasonably priced DLCs that add further interest to the game.
10392,fun
10393,Such a great game!
10394,"这游戏想当市长喜欢规划设计买就完事了。不管是区块规划，还是修路搞流通率，搞人行道搞立交桥搞公共交通都很有意思，而且新手都可以玩很久。更别提还可以造景之类的，配上创意工坊。
p.s目前机场dlc刚更新，虽然重要的mod基本上都修复了，但是我遇到一个问题就是机场升到三级就会特别卡，或者说游戏速度特别慢，开倍速也没用，可能是因为我在家用笔记本玩的，或许换台式cpu和16，32内存会好一点吧，但是我建议大家在建机场之前存个档，多存档，没坏处。"
10395,"I made a dam to generate hydroelectric power, my entire city flooded and since i spent so much money on the dam not even the bailout saved me and i went bankrupt. 11/10 would drown my people again."

10398,FUN BUT BORING IDK WOULD RECCOMEND.
10399,"its just one of those games you get. enough said.
"
10400,very fun i didnt think i would like it as im not into these types of games but its extremely addicting especially with the interactive coments from your citizens
10401,fun and addicting as fuck
10402,It's honestly the best
10403,Fun
10404,the best city builder and very workshop friendly. :)
10405,"If you have an addictive personality, try and stay away, as this game is addictive as hell

I CANT STOP PLAYING IT, check the hours ahaha

but, i do enjoy this game, but top tip. Buy it when it is on sale, with some DLC"

10414,Cities : Skylines is great! It is very heavy on a computer though.
10415,"Fell in love with this game. 
A huge thanks to the creators and community for this masterpiece. 
Strongly advice to play with mods 'cause will they let u do incredible things and help u to achieve what u want."
10416,ghfghg
10417,"Cool Graphics. Awesome control over the city, really nice, i didn't expected it.
12h experience: ~15k habitants after first failed attempt (tryed to size up too fast), stable income ~5k; ~100k fortune."
10418,Very Fun! The best city building game ive played its worth the 30 dollars!

10423,Its fun thats all i gotta say
10424,"Sim City was one of my favorite franchises, but EA decided to ruin Sim City in 2013. 

Cities: Skylines is the new contender for best city building game. The only other challenger is Sim City 4 (released in 2003). 

This game is pretty much all I want in a city builder game. The road flexibility is great, city size is satisfyingly big (big enough to challenge most players' ability to solve traffic issues, especially if you use the mod that nearly triples the building area). The public transport options are plentiful and satisfying to use (like bus lanes! Bus lanes are great. Also street cars, and there's a monorail that goes above streets too), graphics are wonderful, there's very easy-to-use mod downloading and a very active modding community.

I do have a few complaints; traffic won't move out of the way for emergency vehicles and they won't use empty/opposing lanes/shoulders to get around traffic. There really should be a subway station with two connections that are at 90 degrees to each other. If your city has a big budget surplus, and you let the game run overnight, the budget surplus slowly disappears in a logarithmic fashion (which, really, the main point of the game is to be actively developing, so this is just a minor annoyance). It's not available on GOG. And the amount of DLC is annoying. 

BUT! Most of the DLC stuff is cosmetic or radio stations and doesn't affect gameplay.
And every time they release a gameplay-affecting DLC, they also include some neat updates in the base game for free. 

Better still, base game is often 75% off of the already-more-than-reasonable base price, and all of the gameplay-affecting DLC goes on 50% off sale too (as long as it's not the most recently-released one). 
I highly recommend getting the base game, ""Mass Transit"", and ""After Dark"", which when on sale is less than twenty five usd total. Absolutely worth it, imo. 

If you want disasters, that one's also worth it, and the snowfall one is neat too, though may disappoint some. Industries is pretty good if you like managing production chains to make MAJOR cash and provide a source of goods from inside your city, but usually I don't bother. 

Overall I'll reiterate that I think this is the best city-building game out there (though if you want to say Sim City 4 (2003) is better, I won't argue; it's still a great game, and still has a modding community 19 years later). 

Without a doubt Cities: Skylines is the current reigning champion for a still-being-worked-on-by-the-devs franchise. 

12/10, would create a massive traffic jam again (and again, and again)."
10425,This game is really nice. This game needs to be way popular and i think this is one of the best city builder games.
10426,Pollution go brr
10427,I like how creative you can be with this game and that makes it very fun
10428,"A great spiritual successor to the popular Simcity franchise, Cities: Skylines and its DLCs released create a immersive game that both can be fun with and without mods.

With good graphics, fun game play, and so many possibilities the game is by far the best city simulator game on the Steam library or anywhere else. With only Simcity 4 with added plugins/mods being the closest contender to Cities: Skylines. 

Though some concerns for some visual aspects, it is a minor thing. The largest drawback may be, though roads are flexible and can be anywhere; buildings still are stuck on a grid system and can create awkward spaces between buildings. The numbers used to calculate businesses, homes and industrial jobs and occupancy can be questionable as well. As well as a lot of times, the needs for hundreds of Workshop mods for a visually pleasing city or one less ""American"". Overall though, a very great game and I highly recommend it."
10429,sxcghjklpoig
10430,fun
10431,cigo game
10432,"The game now uses it's own launcher which is full of ads for DLC and overpriced microtransations. It requires authentication from their own launcher to play so it's now a huge pain in the butt for those that travel a lot. It also requires agreement to a bunch of end user agreements.
Overall the game is decent but the corporate garbage around it isn't worth the hassle."

10440,A game you can spend $225 on to get the full experience that's not made by EA.
10441,very nice
10442,I really like to plan out a whole city and it's really nice to play. You could go on and build for what feels like forever (in a good way lol)
10443,"A very good game where you can invest a lot of time. The only thing that makes this game even better are the great mods and items from the workshop.
Can only recommend it."
10444,good
10445,Best city building simulator out there
10446,This game is great!
10447,for anyone crying about price just wait a few days and get the game key from a different site iv found it for £5 so far or just use the free mods from the workshop.. i personally still think there's more content that could be added to this game before the bring out CS2 which if you think about it will cost more and for the dlc which come with it.
10448,5/7
10449,"Another day, another Paradox DLC with a game-breaking update that screws you over, whether you bought the new DLC or not. Can't even load the game."
10450,Love Cities: Skylines :)
10451,this is very nice game
10452,very funky and fun i like it
10453,"Too difficult game even at the very beginning. But it's the best city building simulator out there. The game is not for relaxation, you need to think a lot, more than in the most difficult puzzles. It will appeal to those who like to build cities, to understand all the little things. The game requires a lot of time and a lot of thinking. Here you can build any city to taste and color, different locations, a huge selection of buildings, real physics and conditions. I recommend it to fans of such genres."
10454,Her sister was a witch. 8/10 don't know how to do biffa's mods or what he uses but all of my knowledge is from his videos so I'm just out here trying to like control traffic and don't have the tools to do it but I have a blast anyhow.
10455,nice game
10456,chad gameplay
10457,it's fun but not worth the full price considering how feature bare the base game is.
10458,very good if you like a relaxing city builder game.
10459,YES
10460,"This game is for the patient sort of person that enjoys the intricate details that you can pull out of the game. There are also challenges that let you feel some pressure to complete. Finally for the sort of person that just wants to watch the world burn you can build up a city just to launch disasters such as meteors, tornadoes, and earth quakes at it. Personally I have this game on my ps4 and now PC. I enjoyed the vanilla version on ps4 but got annoyed that I couldn't have mods to unlock the entire map or make traffic fixes without changing my whole map around."
10461,"Great game. Highly recommend this to those who wanted a city/urban planning simulation game. If you live in a city that sucks because of traffic, poor infrastructure, you can ""recreate"" your city here and ""transform"" it to a world-class, utopian city with no problems."
10462,Amazing Cityscape Playing. Leaves all previous city simulators (Sorry Maxis!!!) in its wake. Warning highly addictive!!!

10475,"The game used to be amazing. But now, unless you have a top of the line PC, it is unplayable. The map takes a few minutes to load on the average computer. Mods break with every update and having to sift through all of them to figure out which one crashes your game is time consuming. And as said before, even the smallest town will cause your FPS to drop significantly. Save your money and try something else."

10500,"I might be biased, but I have really enjoyed my time with Cities Skylines (I have many more hours on the Xbox version of Cities).  DLC can add a lot to the base game, but the modding community behind this game is incredible and there's no shortage of additional gameplay when it comes to that workshop support.  Saw it is going for less than $10.  It's an absolute steal at that price.

NOTE** I have received some DLC for free, but I already owned the base game prior to any working relationship with Paradox."
10501,Great city building game with lots of workshop content. I enjoy the many hours of game time playing this game.

10519,"Excellent game.  I highly recommend!  Real nice, chill, laid back.  Industries and Parklife add some nice variety to the base game.  Get 'em while they're cheap.  The other DLCs haven't added much value.

There are some issues - it really puts on the hard sell for the DLC.  There's an option to turn it off in the settings: Pop-up guides.  I also recommend silencing the chirper thing too.

But I got loads of dosh and my citizens love me, so I can't complain too much."

10536,as i modded player i gotta admit that i love the 3 hours of troubleshooting that come with every major update this game is a solid 10/10
10537,"11/10 tax simulator. Cant for the life of me get a few tolls up and running to generate any damn revenue. Every time I do, the city dies in 10 minutes.

Its definitely a tougher sim city builder. Takes a lot of patience and time to master how to generate revenue so the city prospers rather than dies. A little less than friendly to the beginner without a money mod to help at all. 

Luckily, I figured out a few things, but the revenue part still gets me at present time. Takes a lot of turnover to learn how to generate money and be able to turn things around.

Used money mod for first few playthroughs until I learned how to generate any money and use it wisely. Will continue to tax everyone like I'm Biden until I can figure out how to Trump card it and win. Thumbs up!"
10538,"I love this game so much, so much im perfectly fine with waiting sometimes two hours for my city of 700,000 to load just so i can look at it for 5 minutes. 100% worth it. 10/10"

10544,"Great city sim, but DLC are required even for most of the better mods to work, and at this point there's no reason to shell out well over a hundred on just DLC for a seven year old game. Would recommend only if they start offering DLC bundles that package most older DLC into a single, affordable package (currently the full game plus all DLC is listed as $274)."

10580,not good no play through tutorial to learn how to play game i even bought the new player bundle all this game wants you to do is spend more money on dlc would not recommend i will be trying to get a refund did not enjoy my experience at all
10581,The hardest difficulty is getting your mods to work.
10582,i love this game just needs gas stationd for a more real affect
10583,Released 7 years ago without optimization for low spec without a commitment to update the engine as a result with decent specs can't enjoy what you paid for this is very disgusting draining dlc content without paying attention to the base game foundation
10584,"I mean... I'm 450+ hours in and I'm finally starting to feel like I almost know what I'm doing. I play only slightly modded (TMPE, Move-it), and feel that the vanilla game is more that enough to build extremely realistic and fun cities! The DLC is always improving the game. And don't miss out on the fantastic YouTube community, I'm always learning new things by watching the major content creators build."
10585,Really addictive!!
10586,this is the best game i have ever played
10587,This is the best city building simulator I have ever played.  Just when you think you have cracked a feature of the game you realise there's something else to work on. Each new DLC adds so much futher game mechanics to the already awesome system. Even though the game is getting old it can still be relied upon to stretch your skills with each city you  build.  Don't even get me started on the workshop and all the extra content and mods I don't have time to explain how awesome some of them are.  I can't count the number of hours I have spent just sorting out traffic. Awesome game - go buy it.
10588,"I don't write many reviews, but I gotta say: this game without all the DLCs (which most of them should be already in the game) is just so barren, that is just too boring to be played after like 20 hours. Unless you're a person with hundreds of dollars to spare, this game is not for you."
10589,"Very fun and rewarding to pass the time, they need to make snapping and angles less janky"

Belli bir yerden sonra sıkıcı gelebiliyor ama DLC paketciklerini satın alırsanız oyununuza onlarca saat daha eklemiş olursunuz. Oyun ile şuana kadar yaşadığım tek sorun Steam Workshop'da bulunan Cities Skylines eklemelerini hiç bir şekilde kullanamam. İyi oyunlar dilerim..."
10591,"Cities Skylines has gone about as far as it can go with the current engine. I also honestly don't think this is an issue with Paradox, but more with the developer. Paradox releases more consistent and featureful (albeit only a bit more) dlc than this. I honestly think these paltry DLC's take so long to crank out because it takes them so much time to do anything with the engine in the state that it's in.

What's more this approach of running sectors as if they were businesses really gets to me. On the one hand you're mayor and have to manage your citizens using certain levers and pulleys which have knock on effects, and on the other, hey let's give you complete control over certain sectors. Its very immersion breaking.

It would be nice if CO would release some smaller games like their older Cities in Motions games (which were amazing btw) to test out new concepts and ideas for a future Skylines game.



taking into account what we've learned these are some areas I think a Cities 2 game would benefit from, a few we can take from older simcity games.


1. City Employees/Managers - Hire employee's from a pool that affect the performance of different aspects, including education, infrastructure, etc (a la simcity)

2. Greater demographics - have a little more detail in your cities demographics, their likes and preferences. Allow your city to develop a personality over time, or areas to have personality.

3. MegaCorps - Allocate swathes of land to megacorps to develop as they please. These can be analogues for what a lot of the current expansions allow, but now they are effectively ""siloed"" from your mayoral job. As a player you can then either take over the megacorp, and manage it, whilst the game manages the city, or vice versa. This could create some interesting symbiosis, and potential conflicts once you get more megacorps into the city. they could muscle their way in when you're low in funds for example. Go into debt? Instead of getting a free grant, a megacorp can come in and say I want x square feet / meters to do with as I please, here is $100,000

a smaller scale alternative might be companies wanting to setup their HQ which could be a unique building that generates x number of jobs. These create challenges to work towards.

4. This also gives players more opportunities to craft different ways to play the game. Do you scale back and give your megacorps tons of control, which leaves you with less things to focus on. Effectively you could recreate the cities in motion goals, as city development would happen thru your megacorps, but key infrastructure such as public transport are still your job. So you need to figgure our your public transport around your megacorp. etc, etc.

5. Better Crime! This adds on to item 2, crime can help provide more character and interest to cities! Grafiti tags, gang wars! Maybe I want to replicate LA from the 90'? or Robocop, I want to see true crime happening in my city! Or maybe it becomes really artsy, so we see fancy murals pop up, or some parts get high tech, or hippies gathering, etc, etc.

6. In general more corporate interaction, for example games convention, Tech conventions, might want to make things happen in your city if you meet certain requirements

7. Old City - have an option to start with existing infrastructure. A real ""old city"" if you will that you need to work around. these can have their own challenges to work around, such as height restrictions, infrastructure challenges, etc. Ideally they can be procedurally generated so each playthru is unique. This way you can have a TRUE old town, not one just player made.




As you can see theres lots of ideas that can be explored. Understandably Cities 2 likely wont have these, but the new engine should be a foundation on which these can be added. I would be happy to pay for some of these as DLC's assuming adequate depth was added."
10592,Need a fairly beefy rig if you want to mod it heavily but the base game is fantastic and I'll keep playing it for years to come.
10593,Nice
10594,To me this game only playable with DLCs and Mods
10595,This game is just legendary. I fucking made a large city and drowned it in poop. That should say something about how good this shit is man.
10596,"F*ck this game I absolutely love it.

Just like my cities this review was going well and it just falls apart the more people start flowing in to read it. Cities Skylines will bring you new understanding of why you sit in a 3 hour traffic jam while on the way to work. They should force all mayors to show screenshots of their cities with 90% traffic flow as a prerequisite to even entering an election. 

If you like building things, which lets face it, you totally f*cking do, look no further. This game has everything."
10597,im terrible at making cities

10607,The number of hours played shown on my profile says it all. 'Nuff said.
10608,"i have 1800 hrs, so obviously i like this game, and i recommend it to those who like living puzzles. But it needs a sequel. A 7 yr old game engine just doesnt hold up anymore, not with todays hardware. Colossal and Paradox also need to take some of the game changing popular mods, such as TMPE and Node Controller, and officially implement them. Overall i really like this game, but I hate the fact I cant give it a recommendation because of those two issues. We need a sequel"
10609,nice
10610,Stellar game!
10611,"it is fun, challenging and looks very good. 
Building beautiful well working cities is defenitely a challenge but super addictive to me"
10612,yes
10613,"Spent total days playing this, best game in my life so far."
10614,"> builds city

10615,$20 for a small dlc? get real guys
10616,"[I will change this evaluation if one day the problem is solved]

It is already a year since I cannot play the game because of saves issue. I bought the Sunset Harbor DLC and then no way to save any game. Support did not find any solution and sell you very expensive DLC and broken game. Since their update it is not working for me anymore... I do not know if anyone met this kind of problems.

Do no recommend this game now with so many bug issues when you pay expensive add-ons. Quite simply unplayable!"
10617,it's complex. Lots of traffic issues when you play vanilla but ... dam...... great game !
10618,Great city builder.
10619,A game to get lost in
10620,I love this simulation game. I played since 2016 until now with so much improvements and also new DLC.
10621,"Love this game, so much fun."
10622,One of the best city mgmt games I've ever played. Highly recommend. Just relax and build a city.
10623,The game is fun and so far runs well
10624,"Amazing City Sim, and all the DLCs add a lot of fun mechanics!"
10625,"mong NSX thêm tiếng việt vào cho dễ chơi hơn
I hope Paradox will add Vietnamese so I can play easier"
10626,Average build a functional city Fan vs Average build a cesspool of dead people and disease Enjoyer
10627,pretty good
10628,This game is addicting and relaxing. Kick back to some lofi and start landscaping for hours instead of fixing your traffic issues
10629,A good city building. cant be hard sometimes but its a good game.
10630,its fun and my frends like it
10631,"Amazing game absolutely love it.

Sadly however it is heavily dependant on Mods / DLCs to make it re-playable... which causes a lot of crashes </3"
10632,man what a game...........
10633,If you like city builders....buy it... i got a couple hours in it
10634,"Install game, play city for five hours, decide to mod and play another 50 hours, get too many mods and break the game, uninstall mods and repeat the process all over again.

Seriously though, phenomenal game. Nothing beats listening to some quality music and plonking down roads, trees and houses. Good game"
10635,Makin penis cities and shii
10636,there is so much detail in the game.i love it more than in any other city game and definitely recommend others to play this game!
10637,traffic manager but it's $30
10638,"I love this game, but sometimes it's like being in an abusive relationship.  It scratches that simulated city building itch and has an amazing mod community.  However, every time the game updates, mods will break and you may or may not lose access to the city you've spent hours perfecting.

Buy the game and various DLCs, and you'll have a great time.  Tread very carefully whenever new DLCs are scheduled to come out, though.  If you use mods, don't fall in love with your city as you'll likely be abandoning it and starting a new one whether you want to or  not."
10639,Always evolving. Great mod community.
10640,its a fun game. the shit that the npcs produce is insane though
10641,"Although it has a hard game concept, it is a very fun game to play."
10642,"Super bloated game, overheats my GPU in seconds, not playable at all."
10643,"i got addicted the first second i touched the game, very great."
10644,jogo bom
10645,"I love Cities:Skylines and have played 2000+ hours. Quit for a while and have been playing Transport Fever 2. I can't help but wish they would take the core game of Cities:Skylines, the precision and graphics of Transport Fever 2 and the fun elements and artistry from the latest Sim City, double the map sizes and create the ultimate city/transportation simulator. There are overwhelmingly good things about Cities:Skylines. I've yet to fall in love with the graphics, colors or overall presentation. Something's missing. TF2 and SC look so much better. Someday, before I leave this life, I hope we get that mega game. It's all there..."
10646,"Superb city building experience. 

There are places with questionable or confusing design choices. And things can get a bit janky at times. But it's often charming, or fixable with mods at the very least.

The modding scene of this game has taken it from a good experience to a genuine classic. The things modders have been able to do have been incredible.

Overall, if you're looking for a city builder that builds upon the foundations of SimCity and Cities XL, this is absolutely for you. Modern versions of those franchises just don't compare to Cities Skylines."
10647,i have an addiction please help
10648,BIG MAC
10649,I once played it for 12 hour straight and it felt like 30 minutes.

10651,No Big Yoshi
10652,"one of the best sandboxes ive ever played, very good if you like desiging road layouts and for if your a planning nerd like me."
10653,Go game just do not install more mods than what your computer can handle
10654,nice gameplay. fun to see all we build came to life especially managing Industries and Public Transportation
10655,build. city. yes. tweet bird.
10656,"City go brr
"
10657,Greatgame - so addictive and time consuming! Also the community/workshop are simply fantastic
10658,"i like it, only have 4 or 3 expansion packs and that's all you need really to get the game going (i mean, when there's like 20 you gotta ask yourself if you want to spend that much money? and wouldn't it be hard to find things?) Add a few mods and fun"
10659,!
10660,"god gam leds
"
10661,"Amazing game - I have spent over 70 hours on it in under two weeks and I'm still addicted. I would recommend this game to anyone! Even when you are out of vanilla content to play with, there are so many new mods being released every day!"
10662,tons of fun
10663,its alright
10664,"Honestly, I love this game. I have it on my XBox, as well as my laptop. Even went as far as to buy a brand new laptop to be able to truly experience it. I think, in a year or two, I'll upgrade that as well, as I have some personal goals in mind. 

It's not a game for everyone. It's deep and detailed, and takes a lot of dedication if you want to make something to be proud of. I jumped in as a novice, and my cities of the past are nothing like my cities of today. I follow a number of youtubers, for ideas and tips mostly, but they frequently show me new possibilities within the game itself. I find it to be extremely fun, and as I drive in the real world, point out interesting intersections, buildings, and design concepts. And with the awesome people that contribute to the workshop, there is always something new to add to your city (though not all mods and assets are made equal). 

TL/DR: Great game with a lot of versatility - unless you are following someone's directions, no two cities will be the same. Even more, an extremely active modding community erases any boundaries for the game itself. Worth the purchase for just the base game!"
10665,This is what SimCity 5 was supposed to look like
10666,"I've been playing for a while and I always come back at some point, so there are fun things to do in the game :)"
10667,How dare you make this game unplayable from raising game spec like a bro of NASA? Optimize it down and I would give recommend.
10668,"Still has too many bugs. For example, the path finding for metro lines is so bad, if I want to add a new stop I have to delete all the lines and redraw them. A lot of the DLC feels very pointless and not well built. They feel on the same level as Sims 4 packs."
10669,"doar pentru oameni destepti, eu nu prea il mai joc *joke*"
10670,good game
10671,"The best city-building SIM by a million miles. Infinite assets and mods, tons of sanctioned DLC thats easy to add to the experience. Cant wait for Cities: Skylines 2 some day."
10672,"One of the best game, You can do about anything you want! I used to play this game on my phone just like this but this is 100x better, its on pc you can get mods all the fun! Love This Game!"
10673,i like how much freedom you have to do what you want and build how you want with a variety of transport options and maps to play on and defeat.
10674,"There are so many different ways to play this game. Personally I like spending hours making my builds look good, but I also have fond memories of that time I felt the need to make my peeps drink poop to clean the the drinking water, or that time I turned on disasters and my city was immediately hit by a giant tsunami."
10675,"This game is absolutely addictive. You can design any way you want, realistic, insane, creative. The real world issues that crop up are either a fun problem to solve, or a headache you can turn off with sandbox. DLC just expands the already fun base game, and creator content is absolutely delicious with a community of thousands who offer amazing items for free in the community. To date, my strangest city (that worked) was a road of just a single spiral."
10676,I would say this game reminds me a bit of twitter. If someone is complaining about your city I can just instantly go to their house and bulldoze it.
10677,everything
10678,good soup
10679,"I admit I have played Cities Skylines on Steam for 33 minutes and within those 33 short minutes, all I could do was set up the roads ONLY because there was so much lag in the game. I have 200 available GB on my SSD so I know it's not my PC. I have played countless weeks of Cities skylines on my nintendo switch and on my PS4 with ease. I'm glad I bought skylines on a sale otherwise I would've been upset on a full price game."
10680,Just spend about 7 hours designing a decent starter highway and city network with mods only to have it all destroyed in seconds by an update. dont waste your time.
10681,it is very addictive and sexy
10682,fun
10683,"Great game, been playing for years, I would highly recommend if you are looking for the best city builder on the marker"
10684,Good
10685,fun city builder. only downside is that half the game is locked behind overpriced DLC.
10686,It's good
10687,good
10688,"It is much too difficult and fiddly to regulate traffic control. Roundabouts, roads up and over other roads, traffic flow and signals, industry/commerce in the wrong place - too difficult!
Also, to educate or not to educate - not enough workers. What a pain trying to get this right.
What a real shame. This would be a really good game but for these two things which spoil it completely. I could never get beyond a population of 10,000 despite trying to follow a Youtube guide TO THE LETTER."
10689,"Cities Skylines is a game you can really let your imagination run wild! Its a game where you can build the city you have always dreamed of in such a way where you can choose everything down to the finest detail. If you can, explore and have some fun with the game! You can really go mad. From tree to train, from sky to skyscraper, from Grass to Park. Its truly something special."
10690,"Good bang for the buck , game can be a PITA without mods"
10691,"games is vary good
"
10692,Good fuckin' game
10693,There are issues when I right-click and I have to double click or restart my PC constantly to try and get it to work normally.
10694,"Best modern City Builder. It can be pretty expensive to buy all DLCs, but sales are common."
10695,makes you think about what and where to place things .....some mods are needed  to go farther in game ... all are readily available in steam ... you can do un.moded but harder to go farther.. have seen very large cities with no mods but look kind of boring and  the same thing over and over again
10696,"Game is completely unplayable after the latest (Jan '22) update.  Can't even start a new game, it just sits at 50% loaded on the loading screen."
10697,best game to play in college classes
10698,good but not real
10699,An amazing game. Best city builder I've ever played
10700,Very fun
10701,good
10702,This is a very fancy traffic simulator.
10703,Fabulous and very entertaining
10704,That's good
10705,This is by far my favorite game. It has everything for a fun creative relaxing playtime. From road layout to city management to industries to traffic management. And good radio stations to enjoy music and fun commercials. Also a very large community of content and mod creators to make your cities stand out.
10706,"I don't recommend this game for the simple reason that while playing it I am constantly seeing menus and options advertised for me to click on only to find I don't have the appropriate DLC installed to build said structure.  The frustration of being shown options that I don't currently possess is enough to turn me off the franchise completely.  There are many games that have continued to release content which I continue to support but none of them do such a horrible job of throwing that content in your face only to tell you that you can't use it without paying a fee.

Just remove it from the options menu if the DLC isn't installed you assholes..."
10707,"Great city builder, that allows you to play with big city/districts planning. The most valuable part for me is planning roads/freight/public transport of different kinds and dealing with all ongoing challenges of growing city up to 100.000 habitats. I really like these games with scenarios and here you have them but only with certain DLCs. But this one was ok to play even without scenario facing all challenges of growing cities. I also liked that even without having all DLCs, some features of them are granted to you for free.

9.5/10"
10708,I have a rule. if game have more than 10 DLCs and if this DLCs are like game should have them in main as content. It's not worth it.
10709,"Super greedy with the DLC.  nothing bad to say about the gameplay, super fun game. if you got $200+ to blow on making it a complete experience. feels like they are competing with EA/the sims for 'most milked DLC game of the year'"
10710,"Great city building game, now i just have to figure out how to make the city's i build actually look good."
10711,great city builder
10712,Its helps me relax after solving problems
10713,You will end up playing this game for hours! Really good and they are always keeping it updated.
10714,"ძალიან კარგი თამაშია, დეტალებითა და შესაძლებლობებით აღსავსე. სიამოვნებით გავატარე 102 საათი და კიდევ 10 ამდენს გავატარებ. ყველა მოუდი და DLC კარგია და საინტერესო რაობას სძენს თამაშს."
10715,no
10716,"great game, especially with modding. you can sink hours into it without noticing"
10717,"It's awesome. The different aspect makes it playable way longer than other citybuilder/management games. You can just chill, build a pretty area, think of the infrastructure, or create highly thought out road schemes, or play around with policies and budgets and district zones. Really a time robber. after half an hour you know how to play, after 2000 hours you still need more practice to master every aspect.

PS the dlcs make good extra content. and mods are GOD!   :)"
10718,this game took over any interest ive ever had in going outside or leaving my couch. BEWARE: SO F****** FUN
10719,"Sometimes the traffic can get infuriating, but you can always reach out to Biffa for help"
10720,
10721,Very Fun game for City Builders and Gamers. I recommend to buy DLC's on sale cos full price is a rip off
10722,"Simply the best city builder game out there, and the thing that makes it even better is the huge community making mods for it, keeping the game alive and fresh. 100% recommend, even the vanilla game is perfectly fine, the DLC are very nice, but if you play on PC there's no excuse to not use the countless mods and assets in the workshop."
10723,fun game!
10724,I like turtles
10725,yes
10726,It is a fun game. It feels so satisfying to see your city come together over time. It gives you many goals to work towards and whenever you're finished with one town you can simply move on to the next. The mods are also a great addition and add new ideas and mechanics for gameplay.
10727,Really good time-sink.
10728,ridiculously addicting
10729,love this sm. perfect for control freaks who like making things look pretty. efficiency!!
10730,"This game is worth buying. Increases your creativity and imagination.
Enjoy and have fun."
10731,"I used to play Sim City when I was younger. This game takes the idea of city builder and takes it so much further. Additionally, if you ever want more assets, the community has created a lot."
10732,Old game with paid DLC's and still plenty of bugs. garbage trucks ans cemetery just stopped working and now just will not work again. of course everyone dies and i cant grow a city. what a shame
10733,"before u buy this game, ask urself, are u an alpha or a beta? if beta, dont even bother. this game is only for alphas."
10734,Love it1
10735,"goodf
"
10736,Creating a city from scratch and being able to access all of the custom assets and mods makes this game work the way you want you want it to.
10737,"its good 
"
10738,traffic rates drop... a lot fun game.. they drop a lot
10739,"This game has been sitting in my inventory for 6 years and it wasn't till this week (thanks to the Airport DLC's upcoming release) that I finally got around to playing it, and man ohhh man this is so good. Cities makes the other city games (all of them) look silly and redundant. None of the other city builders makes me weep at the end of the night when I have to pull myself away from the PC, to get some much needed sleep. I now find myself having 3 meals and a small snack at the computer while I watch my city grow and plot out my next move, and ""where ohh where will my airport go"" I ask myself every 15 minutes. The bottom line is this, if you have it PLAY IT and if you don't have it then GET IT, and don't forget to get all the DLCs.... but be ready to give up having a normal life away from your computer once you become the mayor of your own City Skyline! 
"
10740,ok
10741,Love This Game!!!!!
10742,"its amazing to play! you can build, edit, and many more things!!!"
10743,Very straightforward and well thought out.
10744,sex mod
10745,"I love this game. Since the 1st one (Sim City. NES) lol 
Its super relaxing to just build like logos. 
"
10746,Can't get better than creating your little city and having it GET WREAKED BY A NATURAL DISASTER - good nonetheless
10747,"A cool problem solving game, burns hours like nothing before, worth the money if you got some time to kill"
10748,it is good?
10749,Very good city-building game. Simcity 5 lacks in comparison
10750,I have lost my life to this game.
10751,sxaz
10752,You need to see the workshop!
10753,"absolutely love the game. you have nearly limitless options for how to go about planning out your city. grid? organic bendy roads? or a cul-de-sac hellscape? you decide. how do you manage your traffic? good bike infrastructure and public transit or a massive highway in the middle of the city? no matter your preference, you can easily build it. and mods make your options 10x broader.

Just don't let the game influence your idea of urban planning too much."
10754,good
10755,Proof I should never be a city planner.
10756,"Very entertaining.
"
10757,I bought this game about a week ago and I've already spent 2 consecutive days of my boring life on it. Would recommend to literally anyone.
10758,loved it mate
10759,Gameplay is too limited and assumes everybody wants to build and live in a car centric dystopia. Lack of design freedom reduces fun factor.
10760,this game is good but IMO gets a bit boring 7/10 i played for like 40 min then refunded
10761,👍👍👍👍
10762,This is my kind of game. I no longer enjoy the competitiveness of first-person shooters or the unending beta of other games. I get to feel like a demi-god when playing this game and I love it.
10763,"Sandbox city-builders have been a go-to gaming genre for me since the original SimCity. When SimCity (2013) came out, it was a profound disappointment, and I wondered if SimCity 4 was the final ""good"" instance of the genre.

Then Cities: Skylines started getting good (I remember not being impressed with its initial release), and I've never looked back. This is the true spiritual successor to SimCity 4, and also entirely its own style of city-building game. This is a game I can literally lose entire days to and not feel cheated of the time."
10764,"Best city builder in forever. Never gets boring. Lots of mods & workshop content. To cheap not to buy.

Only negative point: You'll lose hours of your life after starting up the game without even noticing."
10765,"Its good, but you need a lot of the DLCs to actually enjoy it."
10766,"Its like detroit but you fix detroit and if you get good at the game, the city isnt anything like detroit"
10767,"i do not own this game, but i want to tho."
10768,"You need atleast 500 hours to be able to make a city in this, minimum."

10774,"Cool game, highly addictive."
10775,"i'm really interested in building a city and manage it. This game makes my dream come true. In this game, I can design the net of transportation, develop industries that make profit and provide public service for my citizens. I enjoy the moment watching my citizens driving from their house to work, watching the rocket firing to the highest and the scene of cities at night. I recommended this game to several friends of mine and they all appreciate this game. I'm really grateful for the talented designers for this game."
10776,This game is addicting when it comes to building a city.  So many details and changes that can be made while seeing the results in real time.
10777,"Best city building game on the market, but sims level amount of DLC at this point."
10778,hax
10779,detail is outstanding and the game works. Add all the mod you can add and no game is ever the same even after 100 hours on a map. Only down side by the time you add all the paid add on packs it starts costing.
10780,d
10781,very good
10782,good
10783,Highly addictive
10784,"I don't usually write reviews on Steam but I will for Cities: Skylines.

This is the game I have played the most of probably any video game ever. When I was a kid I used to love Sim City 2000, 3000, and 4, and this game is the best successor to those games, far superior to the last Sim City that was released.

The sheer amount of creativity that you can put into cities is astonishing, with the DLC and all of the great mods and assets in the workshop, you can create pretty much any style of city/towns/countries you want to.

I just built a $1700 gaming rig primarily so I can download more assets and mods for this game specifically. I cannot recommend this game highly enough to anyone who enjoys city building/management sim games. 

With all of the DLC, the game does get quite expensive if you pay full price, but they go on sale on here all the time so you can easily get them for far less than the normal sales price if you wait a little bit for a sale.

DOWNLOAD THIS GAME!"

10793,it is fun
10794,Want to have a full game? Go buy the dlc's or no fun for you.
10795,It is a very fun game it is a game that you can spend hours playing
10796,"its fun! but your computer must be able to handle it, i have an older mac and i can barely get to 50,000 population before it gets really laggy."
10797,This game is super fun and a great city building simulation. I love all the expansions they come out with and its just relaxing and fun.
10798,Fun building game with multiple levels of complexity and design. 10/10 would recommend!
10799,"Great creativity. Make any kind of city you want, with all the different DLC's and ways to build it. They only get better, especially with the workshop."
10800,"Unironically one of the best games you can buy in 2022. For only $30, it's a steal. Highly recomend.

10802,the mods make it fun
10803,Love this game :)
10804,-
10805,Ultimate city builder (with mods).
10806,I watched many videos on this game before I bought it. I love the building cities type of game and this one is easy to use. This game also has mods as well as add-ons. There is a large player base and you can even import and export files from other places. If you are not sure about this game. Just look on Youtube for all the different players who have uploaded videos showing the game play.
10807,"Evrything we ever wanted when playing simcity sim city,"
10808,good game
10809,it's what It's
10810,This is a great game to kill time and just get creative but also take on the reality of city management. Would recommend to others!
10811,"This game is definitely the true successor to Sim City 4. After Maxis dropped the ball with Sim City 5. This game came along and has re-defined the city building genre and evolved it to the next level. The amount of details and amount of ways you can control and grow your city is astonishing.

From building theme parks to building nature reserves to making industrial ports and airports, you can pretty much do anything, there are literally no limits to the way you can develop your city. 

One day I'll find myself destroying entire city blocks to lay down a new vital railway, another day I'm planing to build a giant park on an island. Suddenly I have to make room for a stadium and make sure I don't cause a massive eternal traffic jam. 

Good music, good UI, and great gameplay. 

Easy 10/10 

A must play for any city building enthusiast. This is definitely the game of my dreams."
10812,Awesome game. Addictive.
10813,"I cannot in good conscience recommend this. 

Build Residential zones. Build Industry zones. Build Commercial zones. Update infrastructure to accommodate. Repeat. 

All you have to do is follow the meagre demands of the Residential/Commercial/Industrial bar and you're gravy. The only minor problem you have to solve is how to handle traffic. A city-builder that should be named Traffic Management Control. 

The sheer number of DLC packs you'd have to purchase to make the game even remotely interesting, or complete for that matter, is disgraceful. They'rs simply nothing to this without them (no I haven't purchased any and have no intention of doing so). This feels like an EA game where the game is launched in piecemeal and you have to pay for each part."
10814,fard
10815,Good game if you like to build citys
10816,Allowed me to burn and rebuild perfect cities
10817,pırrrrrrrrttttttt
10818,It is a fun city building game and I really enjoy playing it.
10819,This is the best city building game of all time! I love it!
10820,toppppppp
10821,fun and no dislikes
10822,Great game!  Great community!
10823,The most satisfying city builder to date.
10824,"If you grew up playing Sim City, this is the game to get! Focus on city building and, if you can spare the time,  spice up the little details. A couple very minor issues with gameplay but overall it's everything I want in a city builder. Worth it."
10825,اللعبة ممتعة جدا
10826,"I love the depth of this game so much more than Sim City. My main suggestion is this isn't a rat race, take your time, love the city you build."
10827,Grate game lots of fun way's to make your dream city also fun mods and addons hope yous enjoy the game as much as i do.
10828,10/10
10829,"I recommend this game, it's good."
10830,"For nearly a decade since 1994, Transport Tycoon has been THE game for me. This (g)old transport simulation classic was replaced by Roller Coaster Tycoon and it's first two sequels for nearly other ten years. 
And in 2015, Cities: Skylines came. This game has the best from all the other games of the simulation / building / management genre. For me, it is THE game for the last 6 years with about 1,800 in-game hours on record. Despite having a busy working and personal life, this game is something worth sparing a few hours a week to relax and switch my brain to a ""city-planner-mode"". This game is simply a must-try for all gamers interested in this genre. Enjoy!"
10831,"If you can figure out what the fuck you're doing, good game
It doesn't really explain much though.
Or, y'know, I might just be stupid
I am, aren't I
Siiiiiggggghh"
10832,"By far one of, if not, the best civilization/city simulator games made."
10833,fun and easy
10834,"I would recommended it to other players, as there are many fun things to do, but there are also limitations that block your gameplay. You can be so detailed, but theres a 60k limit for props. The game is really good if you want to make your own city."
10835,Best CIty Builder Game out there
10836,One of the best city-building games I've ever played. It is incredibly addictive and fairly well-balanced in terms of difficulty.
10837,"It's a great game to play. However, it could be better if the game wasn't so unoptimised (for reference it can take up like 15GB page file)."
10838,i keep building detroit
10839,Very Good game
10840,"Games decent, the DLCs are fucking disgusting as always with Paradox"
10841,"Picked this up last year because 2021's releases couldn't be asked to look even slightly enticing to me. Also, this games been on my backlog since it released, and man do I regret not picking it up sooner.

I absolutely love this game! I've been a fan of the Sim City games since I was a kid and Its the perfect successor to it. I was surprised with how much user freedom is in this game compared to Sim City, from city building to budgeting. There's a huge modding community that I haven't jumped into yet, and a wide array of additional content that is still being developed 6 years later. 

Vanilla Skylines is pretty good. It's a fine game on its own but I'd recommend picking up a few DLC's if you want more variation and challenges. My favorites that I have so far are Parklife, Industries, and Green Cities (Thank god for that last one, seeing all of the pollution in my city was driving me crazy. and it also feels nice making a 100% Green City!)  

Wholeheartedly recommend this game, I see myself playing this a lot in the future."
10842,GOOD
10843,"No momento que escrevo, esse jogo é o melhor jogo de simulação de cidade, fácil de aprender e com desafios pra se tornar um mestre. Eles também dão muito suporte para os MOD e chegam a comprar-los pra fazer Delicias."
10844,Lots of replay value. Mods are a requirement for this game.
10845,"best game about 
"
10846,"I am saying 'no' to whether I would recommend this game ""as a game"", but I want to say yes to recommending it as a toy.

Cities Skylines is beautiful, it really is.  But is it a game?  In the first few stages of growing your city you will need to make sure you can make it profitable and get an income going but after those first few stages there are no real challenges or any thing of any real importance that can stuff you up (except maybe traffic flow: managing traffic is actually really interesting), so I consider this to be more of a toy than a game.

You can play with this and spend years of your real life building the most gorgeous cities imaginable!

Therefore, I strongly recommend to download all the mods that are available and custom build your own buildings and put them in too, because money is effectively infinite anyway once you're set up and the real strength of Cities: Skylines is in its beauty.  Most of the mods help you to better control how traffic flows and allow you to place buildings exactly how and where you want them.  It's all about beautification so go for it, get them all.

I have already spent hundreds of hours on this so I am aware I will sound like a hypocrite, but, I think I would rather go out and build a real model railway or get some old pieces of wood and make something that I can touch than to do it on a computer.  Or find a city game that has challenges and is actually a game :)

If virtual architecture is your thing then you will love this.  If you want to build a city and play through a game where you will be challenged and really have to think about how the city works, then...  well, come to think of it I don't really know what game to recommend, I am still searching to satisfy that kind of feeling.  I am currently playing the ancient Tropico 3 which I am enjoying even though it's less gorgeous."
10847,"Step 1: Build a dam
Step 2: Fill it with sewer water
Step 3: Demolish the dam
Step 4: Watch your city flooded with poop water"

10853,Best city building game for now
10854,"its a fun game, especially modded, but also fun on it's own."
10855,",kmol"
10856,"One of the greatest games I've ever played. Great community with amazing mods and add-ons. You can make the game super easy and laid back, or challenge yourself. I can't say enough about this game. I get lost and hours go by, 10/10"
10857,Fun game to play
10858,"This game could be fun. But in reality it should be called managing and debugging mods. The base game is so limited that you need dozens of mods from moving items to laying roads, to managing traffic or loading the game more efficiently not to speak of the hundreds of assets for your city. And when you think you have it together you discover bugs like traffic vanishing in the middle of the road or assets not working properly. Then you you go back to what I first mention, debugging your mods to find the culprit. I am done. Only interested in a Cities Skylines 2 if most or all of those essential mods are part of the base game."
10859,Be prepared to spend all your time perfecting your little city
10860,I really wish curved buildings were a thing.
10861,"If you want to build a city, this is what you're looking for."
10862,Former SimCity player until Mac messed that up for me.  Took me a while to get used to this but a few good YouTube videos got me going on the right path and I'm enjoying it very much!
10863,I like.................Citys...............
10864,i have 1tb worth of mods for this game from the workshop but fun game 10/10 would throw another meteor at my city again.
10865,"Once you start playing this game, it'll be impossible to turn it off. Hours turn into days, days to weeks and your family might report you missing."
10866,Really a nice game. I miss the old Sim City where there wasn't a lot of junk going on. This game is pretty straight forward. Wish it had better controls for moving between creating streets/zones. But it's not a bad game and would recommend.
10867,fun
10868,Great game.
10869,Jak za 20 złoty to jest git .
10870,"Man, this game is addicting."
10871,"Quite fun. Really advanced, especially compared to other city-builders. Though there are some weak spots of the vanilla game, which can easily be fixed with workshop mods. Worth buying though be warned, hours go past easily while playing: a 30 minute look can turn into 2-3 hours easily."
10872,It's just fun. Having DLC's makes it a lot better.
10873,Fun City Building Game!
10874,"Best City Builder on Steam. If you can only have one, this is the one to have."
10875,city
10876,"Sometimes after a rather busy day, I am up to some blood-thristy orc bashing with friends. Somedays, I just want to be left alone with my thoughts. CS gives me a chance to focus to those thought with a creative flare.  I enjoy the slower pace with little interruption. (Except for that dumb bird) The longer I play, the more I have enjoyed it. I find myself starting to plan now instead of just plop and play. I have added a couple of DLC and some mods, that make the game in little more interesting. I think the one thing I can share, the game is deceptively easy appearing when in reality it is deeper and more complex than seen at first glance."
10877,"Nothing in comparison can match this game. It is more detailed than any other city builder game I've played, which says a lot because I've played 4. It's very obvious that there was a lot of work put into this game, unlike anything else. You can even see the turning signals on cars!"
10878,Cities: skylines is fun building game were you can manage a city and if you get some DLCs then it would make the game more fun/realistic if you get the Natural disaster DLC you can spawn disasters in your which make it more realistic.
10879,"Great game, lots of fun. Very nice to play while watching youtube."
10880,I 100% Reccomend this game for the price that it is its a steal
10881,"it's nice and calming to remove all of the police stations, fire stations and clinics and see everything fall to dust"
10882,complicated but fun
10883,This game is bad.  So many problems installing it.  So many problems trying to hear back from the developers.  Very very glitchy.  Really not worth it. Much better games out there
10884,"Very fun. With ""addons"" from the steam workshop it makes it 100x better ;)"
10885,"good game. minor bug, big massive active community. nice"
10886,cool game about building cities
10887,A great casual game to play when bored.

10892,nice game
10893,"Beautiful city builder, that is complex and easy at the same time. Perfect for hungover saturday mornings. Prepare your coffee, listen to a podcast und build a city. Then it is 8 p.m. and you did not notice how much time you have invested placing roads and trees to fit your perfect imagination."
10894,"very, very fun cant get enough so far my biggest city is around 30k population"

10907,its really fun and good for people who want to be civil engineers.
10908,"so fun! I used to play SimCity, but its too old for my computer. I play this on my 2020 macbook with no issues"
10909,Is great when the poop flood comes
10910,gotta love creating massive populations to destroy with meteors...
10911,This is one of the best city builders I've played and i cannot wait for the airports expansion coming in a few days time. :) Absolutely recommend this one.
10912,I love most of it.  Hope there will be turn lanes included to complete the simulation.

10926,only get if u gon provide for the skreets
10927,"6 years ago this game landed as a giant middle finger to EA for the dumpster-fire that was SimCity.   And it immediately stole the crown from that title never to hand it back.  Few cooler things have happened in the world of gaming.

Cities Skylines has its faults for sure, and not least among those is that Paradox wants to sell it to you in little $20 DLC's.   I hate that business model, but it's where we are I guess.   Not all of the DLC's are necessary, but some of them do bring a lot to the party.  So watch lots of YouTube and make sure you know whats going to work for your style.

It's a good game that I keep coming back to when I'm sick of everything else.   Kind of like watching reruns of South Park, its just always fun, even if you've done it 800 times.

Anyhow, definitely worth it for the core game, and as for the DLC, thats all up to you.   It's a solid game."
10928,Amazing!!!
10929,"Good Game
"
10930,lol good :)
10931,.
10932,Best city builder so far!
10933,Amazing game. Gives players opportunity to experience the life of a mayor or leader. Would 1000% recommend.

10939,stop getting the plague god damn it
10940,"I remember playing Sim City on NES for hours and loving it (and then every version after including the smartphone app). This scratches that itch, but is also so much more. It's super satisfying to build a city and watch it grow The mechanics are easy to understand and the game is just challenging - and adaptive - enough to let me keep playing for as long as I like."
10941,"Good game better than SimCity.

10950,laggy and bloated. not worth the money
10951,Have you ever tried using drugs like Meth or Heroin? Childs play compared to this. Trapp city rh.
10952,This is the first City Builder that actually keeps you coming back. The game is expansive and delivers on every level. More like this please!
10953,"Don't even bother with this game, I spent around 90 dollars on the base game and some of the best DLCs, because I have played it in the past on my console and I wanted to get it on my computer but it wont even load up my first map when I try to play it. It crashes when I try to create my first world, it will load about 3/4ths of the way and then just crash. I am on a fully compatible brand new computer. I have spent about two days researching on the internet trying to fix the issue, and nothing works. Believe me I have tried EVERYTHING I have tried uninstalling it and reinstalling it, downloading the Paradox Launcher, and I have tried multiple different methods to fix this issue. I have decided to cut my losses and move on I am extremely disappointed. Do your wallet a favor and DO NOT BUY THIS GAME!!!"
10954,"Bought game after falling in love with creator content, just as fun playing myself!"

10958,I love it!
10959,I am now the mayor of the world because of this game.
10960,Very good for people who love sandbox games

Absolutely love this game!"
10986,ok
10987,"you really get into it once you've played it a lot, i really recommend this game for anyone who wants to pass time"
10988,"The game is great when it runs, but the technical issues are so severe that I cannot ""recommend"" it. 1# I have had the game crash my ENTIRE computer many times during start, yet never while actually playing the game, so I expect their ""launcher"" is the culprit. 2# Even though my PC is 3X more powerful than the “Recommended” specs, I still have all kinds of FPS issues; i.e. the game is horribly optimized, or maybe the specs they suggest are artificially low to boost sales? 3# Often when I close the game its still “Running” in Steam, and the only way to close it is to restart my computer. 

All of these issues are beyond anything I have experienced as a gamer before. I am “ok” with the occasional bug in a game, but Cities does things that are completely unacceptable.
"
10989,God I love this game. It paves a large highway bypass through my coal-powered heart.
10990,Great game to play while bored .
10991,"I like it, its fun. I wish they added a DLC for real estate and gated communities, or maybe a future themed DLC with flying cars. Pretty sure they're already working on CS:2 at the time of writing this review so hopefully we can see something like that in the future. Also we need more policies and more tools to customize roads, turning lane, and all that stuff. But overall I enjoyed Cities Skylines but if they added those things to the game as I mentioned above, it would be my all time favorite game."
10992,This game tells a story of how a indie company beats a Triple A title from EA. 10/10 story made me cry!
10993,This game is great highly reccomend
10994,Great city builder with amazing mod support.

11000,"A good game overall, but wtf 200 €uros for DLC to make it worth playing..... i dont think so....
Especially since there is no story, no progression, no multiplayer, and with only sandbox environment this is almost worse than SIMS.... besides, all the DLC content should be free to play mods for the game...
Love the game, hate the DLC whoring...."
11001,i liked

11013,"Its a bit expensive to get but its worth to get, just everything you can do, download mods that are free, mod packs made by players is awesome theres almost no limit to the game and the mods. 

I would recommend to get Cities Skylines Industries DLC for the game. Makes it fun and generates lots of money for building, park life DLC also recommended."
11014,Great City Sim
11015,Pretty Entertaining

11037,"CIties: Skylines is a very addictive game, particularly to those who enjoys managing and planning things. If you plan to get this game, don't forget to also check out the mods available in the community page."
11038,just love it
11039,Fun game.
11040,"Great Game. Probably the best City Building game you can find. You have full control of everything, play how you want, manage all your taxes, services and TRAFFIC (bit difficult to solve it but gives you some challenge to it). Graphics may not be very impressive but these graphics are most suitable as the game can lag a lot if you keep expanding onwards.

Recommend it!"
11041,I find this game enjoyable
11042,"Fantastic game, Ive been a massive fan of city builders since the original simcity came out, this feels like the pinnacle of that type of game, If you love simcity 4, then this will this game will be right up your alley, I have played this game since it 1st came out, and have enjoyed the updates I have purchased. I come back to this game time and time again over the years."
11043,Awesome!
11044,Very good
11045,Yes
11046,Great!
11047,grape
11048,i like building cities and blowing them up (i am a psychopath and a danger to society)
11049,"at some point in playing this game, you can consider yourself a qualified city planner for your local city"
11050,"It's THE City Builder without par. While some DLC's are hit-and-miss, they are super supportive of the modding and content creator community which creates something so much bigger than anything else out there. So much that you get into a cycle of downloading everything to the point where your PC melts and you get C:S burnout after making a super detailed maxed out map. But there's always something to come back to when you're ready to explore the next DLC and CCPs."
11051,If you enjoyed SimCity back in the day you'll love this game. Got everything they had plus more...and a heap of mods to improve your experience.
11052,"eeeee
"
11053,Love this game with mods
11054,"Fun and challenging game. I've watched City Planner Plays, Biffa, and Overcharged Egg play it for a while now so I decided to hop on a give it a shot."
11055,meow
11056,"This game is whatever you make of it.  I love the design and balance aspects of it, managing traffic and demand, and creating scenes in each area.  Be careful, its a time sink!"
11057,Fun
11058,its always been a great game.
11059,"Is like a simcity without EA
It's a very good game but it can improve the UI, specially the icons of everything"
11060,"This game is the bees-knees. I love it and can't get enough. Of course it isn't perfect, and I have MUST have mods. Lol. (personal preference) But it quickly became one of my favorite games."
11061,"effective time killer. if you like games like sims, sim city, civilization etc then this will definitely consume your life lol. my wife isnt even a gamer and she was hooked"
11062,good
11063,Amazing Game!
11064,
11065,Somewhat of a learning curve but a great game to play if you enjoy building things. I didnt think I would enjoy this game at first but have come to love building cities of my dreams!
11066,dammmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmn boy
11067,just install them mods

11069,"This game is both relaxing, but I need to take days off in between games because it also drives my anxiety to the max."
11070,"I've always loved this game. i've played all city building games and games close to be city builders and this game is my #1 choice and always come back to it.  it's also great that after all these years they have not stopped producing things for the game. in the past i did have a lot of crashing and lagging problems but that seemed to be just my computers as i never purchased a high performance PC.  Now that i have a high performance Pc the game runs so smooth, hasn't crashed once, and loads very fast even with a city over 400k population and mods.  though there is small things i wish would change, i am over all very happy with this game, which you can tell with me having over 900+ hours of game play at the time of review."
11071,Great City Builder Game! Nice and Relaxing.
11072,nice
11073,"It is an excellent game, if you enjoy city planning. I only wish I had a better computer for the graphics."

11083,"unlike other Citybuilding games you can expand the city w\ mods 
and with mods u can build the whole map.
Steam Workshop integration, need more mod-able games."
11084,"It's well made but the dlc contains content that should've been in the base game. 
Way too expensive imo and it gives the base game the impression that it hasn't had new content since launch. If you're looking for an updated Sim City, I'd get this w/dlc on sale"
11085,"The 30€ base game's a bit expensive, but if you like city sims it'll be great.
To complete the game they're selling a 200€ bundle... so so disgustingly greedy. 
Fuck Colossal, fuck Paradox, fuck these reviewers, they deserve mobile games."
11086,"yep
"
11087,"Melhor jogo de City Builder. Mas...

Quem faz o jogo ser bom é a comunidade (e que grande parte não recebe nada por isso). Não há diversão sem pelo menos uns 5 mods e 3 DLCs. Sem isso, a experiência é limitada e sua cidade vai ficar parecendo qualquer subúrbio americano genérico desenhado a régua. Compre o jogo somente se você tiver certeza que seu computador aguenta baixar conteúdo adicional. E também se ele estiver na promoção. Fora isso, não vale.

Enfim, adoro jogar Cities Skylines. Porém, quem merece os créditos pela diversão é quem criou Move it, Precision Engineering, Intersection Making Tool e outros milhares de assets incríveis (principalmente de interseções). Só com conteúdo adicional a criatividade flui."
11088,"i liket it
"
11089,a
11090,i made tilted towers and dusty depot
11091,good game

11093,Is gud
11094,"naais
"
11095,"Cities is one of the best games I have ever played, and with Mods it's probably my all time favorite game ever. You can create your dream city, and if there is not a certain building you can always download it in the Asset section of Steam. What a wonderful, beautiful creation.

I think Paradox should do a poll for more DLC, what people would like to see."

Making more DLC wont make the game better 
and my wallet is tired of buying ur shit
you are 1 of the 4 horse men of the apocalypse
the game is useless without using 200 mods
everything is bad in the game not just the AI being dumb 
I will never buy another DL-

OH HELL YEAH THIS IS JUST WHAT WILL FIX THE GAME

11100,"[b]Cities Skylines[/b] is an incredible game for those who like this proposal.
For people like me who have played a lot of [i]Sim City[/i] will get involved with the graphics and gameplay of CS. The roads and highways are involving, the collection of water and energy are also unique. in short, a similar but peculiar game.

11101,Favorite simulation game. This game is detail oriented and it allows for various ways to make your own city.
11102,"There are two types of people who play this game, The Stem or art student with way too much fucking patience to move a shrub to its optimal position in a suburban park with more space in the file dedicated to assets and mods then the base fucking game. Or the Megalomaniac god complex ridden lunatic that makes tokyo as it is in the godzilla franchise look like somewhere you would feel safe, with such classic ""torture methods"" such as flattening a city with a tsunami of their own shit, or simulating what happened to Boston in fallout 4."
11103,(:
11104,"A game of patience and workshop content. You need to spend the time subscribing to things to enhance the gameplay, and most of the time just sit it out and wait for funds to build."
11105,$168 of DLC
11106,"It is super fun to build a city in this game, especially how it can be tough. The difficulty is well, and I have purchased the Sunset Harbor DLC Already, and the DLC is great! Definitely worth it."
11107,One of the best games for chill play I know. Absolutely love it.
11108,its a realy nice game with a nice and realistic grafik

11125,"[b]Yet another City Builder game with the feeling of High-Level Simulation.[/b]
The game is a great example of how immersive a game can be in all of its aspects from building custom architecture to managing city problems. It captures most of the aspects of a [i]real life City Builder[/i] (called Mayor in-game). One can make the [b][i][u]Dream City[/u][/i][/b] of their own with this game.

Although being a magnificent game, it has some problems~
[list]
[*]Being built in old Unity engine, it is not fully efficient in using the computer resources. No matter how great gaming build you have, it would definitely lag at some point.
[*]Though it offers the somewhat real experience of a City Mayor, it has some very unrealistic stuff too, for example- the Death Waves is a common problem as it just creates lots and lots of dead bodies around the city at a single time, and they just increases as you grow the city and are sometimes so brutal that you would have to use mods or scripts to stop them from happening.
[/list]"
11126,I really enjoy traffic management and the modding scene is crazy
11127,MUST. RAISE. TAXES...
11128,"I have a lot of fun with the game, because it's just so realistic. I think that if you like simulation games, you would LOVE to play Cities Skylines."
11129,I liked the customize-ability and the realistic factors. its a good game for the micromanagers
11130,I played Sim city when I was a kid.  And this is definitely a worth successor.  Super fun.  It's actually crazy how detailed everything is when you zoom in and follow some of the people or cars around your city.  It's kind of annoying though when you cause pollution as there's not much you can do about it.  I ended up having to switch to just using water towers and demolished all my water pumps lol.  My water is solid brown for a good chunk of the river..
11131,"Love this game, love, love, love this game and I can't even get very far with my crappy graphics card.  Oh, yea, love this game."
11132,"This game is so addictive, as someone who loves city design this game is so fun. Even for people who aren't interested in cities its still very fun. I will say starting off is very confusing and it's sometimes hard to tell if you're doing good or not."
11133,city.
11134,"Awesome game! The replayability is insane because you can just let your imagination run wild and come up with no ideas or try to copy things you've seen in real life or even online! The mods/assets on the workshop are also unbelievable, with full on mods adding even more stuff to an already packed out game! Some of the DLC/Content creator packs/radio stations might not be everyones cup-of-tea but a few of them are worth it - but the base game is so so so worth it, even if this game is 7 years old!!!!"
11135,Love this game. A great time sitting around in a circle with friends playing simultaneously.
11136,"if you like cities as much as i do, let alone building games like this, please get it. even if you might have just a console or an absolute potato PC, this game is fun even if you can't mod it."
11137,VERY GOOD GAME TOTAL DOES NOT HAVE ANY GLITCHES 10/10
11138,its pog
11139,
11140,"Great game i have been playing for years on X-BOX, finally got it here but there is one problem on X-BOX you can see how far out electricity and water reaches but i cant here on PC, so if there is something i have to turn on please tell me."
11141,"This game is a lot of fun, I have been playing it on the Epic store and received the Steam version as a gift so I would have access to the Steam Workshop. If you're into to life sims like The Sims games or Sims City this is one to add to your collection, which will bring you hours of city building fun or chaos depending on your play style. If you're like me and enjoying watching content creators while gaming then this community has a lot to offer some I would recommend would be RTGame, Biffa, City Planner Plays, and YUMBLTV.

10/10 would buy again"
11142,american city planning simulator
11143,It is a good game.
11144,"Really nice game, calm relaxing (until large pop)
Traffic management could be better, but the workshop provides everything you can dream of!"
11145,good.
11146,"An exceptionally detailed city builder. The DLC is a bit pricey, but it's been a blast to keep playing this game over the years as it has continued to improve and add more to do."
11147,Good game
11148,its fun af
11149,GG
11150,yes
11151,Okay so while it's not Simcity (which in my opinion has gone downhill over the years) it is entertaining to play.

11154,Great for city planners
11155,veri gud i sell my pepol on black market for moni
11156,played for fifteen hours straight
11157,Paradox at its best. Playing most paradox games go something like this. The game is dense and you don't understand anything for the first 100 hours. Then you start to be somewhat competent. Understand the basic controls and can start to do things. Then it will be a blast and you will go and play for over 1000 hours. Here by the nature of the game slowly inroducing things to you as your city grows. You can basicly skip the first part
11158,i'm gonna need more Ram
11159,Great way to feel productive and burn a whole day staring at your screen building / managing a city for the little any people.
11160,"One of the most addictive Sim game I've ever played with. A fascinating and engaging city builder with a solid, active community of modders and players."
11161,"Very fun, playable game with endless possibilities. Definitely recommend!"
11162,One of the best city-builders ever made!
11163,"Realistically you have 2 main options for a city builder. This and SimCity. I love both if im honest each has there own things i like. I love the customisation of this but i love the simplicity of SimCity. SimCity it felt like there was a purpose with building of the ""Wonders"" and you could play with friends but this is way more realistic. This is more of a Sim than SimCity but for me SimCity has way more character. I recommend both but if you really want the best ""sim"" game then this is the one."
11164,The best city builder out there
11165,good game i like men

11180,Everything that the new Sim City should have been and more
11181,"Way, way, way too much stuff is locked behind DLC.  Game feels broken.  I have to spend 10 minutes on google just to figure out the building I'm looking for costs another $10."

11188,"City Building in this game is very fun,there is a few problems with education but that is probably because im bad af. Would recommend"
11189,"If you are into city builder games then this is for you! I love this game. Played it on console, and then built a PC so I could play on PC. 

The vanilla version is pretty basic and gets a little dull but the DLC add lots of new features and mechanics that make the game more fun. The MODs that are available make the game even better, allowing you to design your city exactly how you like."
11190,Ruined by money hungry DLC slingers. Disgusting.
11191,good
11192,Fun
11193,"Build a city, make it look good, half your citizens die of plague from the river, realise desicions you made years ago in game have damned you. Rely on the loans, never pay them back, end up paying them back, then take out loans to repay other loans. Big business big bank."

11207,"very nice, the mods from the workshop really add to the game"
11208,A game i could spend hours and hours on just playing with the traffic routes trying to make sure my citizens dont have to deal with boat loads of traffic. The many different things that his game has to offer leads to a deep level of immersion and caring for my digital people. this often leads to hours of trying to fix the silliest and most minor problems but i love it
11209,Great game for builders
11210,"There is nothing like watching your city just be.  The people going to work, to school, shopping or relaxing, the cars and the trains and the day and the night and the lamps and the sounds.  Everything.  It's an extremely pleasing game, the visuals and sounds are super, and you get a real feeling of being there inside the city watching it run, watching it live."
11211,wonderful game!
11212,Pretty great
11213,good
11214,vary addicting
11215,"Here's a back-handed compliment, Cities: Skylines is great city builder for 2015.  I think it gets a lot of credit for being really good when in reality what made it stand out was being better than SimCity 2013.  Cities came out just two years after that mistake and because it was a city builder and not whatever Electronic Arts was convinced people would actually want it kind of got a free ride.  Skylines is a perfectly competent city building sandbox.  It has decent building tools, and it's fun to watch your city sprout up over time.  However, I have to point out that cracks have really started to show over the past few years.

This is partly because they announced another 5 pieces of DLC for the game and it's like, yes, Cities was fine but the game is begging for a proper sequel.  I just finished up Jurassic Park Evolution 2 and if you play many of the simulation games from the past five years, the lack of scenario and campaign content really starts to stand out.  Where is the *challenge* in managing this city?  It's a nice creative sandbox to play around in, and it's one of the most competent city builders you can find, but it's also just painfully underwhelming by modern standards.  To have them then offer up another reskin of an existing feature six years on it kind of makes you hope someone else comes along to get us out of this rut."
11216,download mods and its even better to play
11217,I would play this game daily if it would have any kind of multiplayer...
11218,"Great game, love the mechanics"
11219,Awesom gaem.
11220,"Base game is ok, but the dlcs are overpriced. Paradox effect."

11222,Best city builder bro
11223,Love it! Definitely Recommend.
11224,One of the most addictive games i have ever played in my life hands down.
11225,Fun and entertaining. Allows you to do good city planning.
11226,Nostalgic game play similar to simcity.  Love all the aspects you can control.
11227,Cities: Skylines is a good game.
11228,Remember when Simcity came out? No? Oh.
11229,DOESN'T SUCK
11230,Great Game I have Spent hours playing it.
11231,"Really enjoy this game, super fun and a a lot of replay-ability with mods and DLC. I can personally say that this game is a bit more in depth than Sim City so that is a great aspect about this game. The attention to detail as well is really great and can take hours upon hours to build the perfect city that you have envisioned. I will definitely say that this is a around the same skill for Sim City though Sim City is a bit more easier and a lot smaller on the scale. One con about this game is that there is no multiplayer like Sim City has, I would definitely want to see what kind of creative mind my friends have on building their cities online with other people!"
11232,Is good!
11233,good sim

11239,"This game without mods/dlcs sucks, but with them it's a whole new experience, worth the money (when on sale)"
11240,"Although I'm not a fan of the copious number of pricey DLCs, I would still highly recommend the base game to anyone with even a remote interest in city planning/building. The number of mods that significantly enhance the quality of the gameplay almost make up for not owning any of the additional content, and contribute to the vast replayability of this game. Cities: Skylines, in my eyes, is not simply a great city-building game, but rather a great game by any standards, worthy of a place in everybody's collection."
11241,fantastic！！！！

11250,My city has been completely destroyed by the tyrannical leadership whom which we followed for so long. 10/10 would wreak havoc again.
11251,addicting ngl
11252,good game =D
11253,"Like everybody knows Sim City, right? Well, sure, Cities: Skylines is also a City building game and one might ask: ""They are all the same, you've seen one, you've seen 'em all"" ... Well, Cities: Skylines got something special about it. Where Sim City hasn't seen any new content for some time, Cities: Skylines still gets fresh new stuff after several years of ""service"". And interesting content, too. There are quite a lot of great features, that distinguish it from those other city building games... like, your City is actually growing with time... I mean not only in the number of it's habitants, but also in the area. You can aquire new areas around your starting plot, gain access to additional resources and more place to build. This feels way more natural than just having that one square area and that's it... 
So all in all: Cities: Skylines is definitly a game worth it's price. It offers tons of fun and no City will be the same as the others. With lots of different maps and Scenarios to play, I promise you many many hours that you barely notice to have passed."
11254,This game knows how to f u c k
11255,"Love this game, come back to it year after year to spend hours playing!

Update 1/30/22: just purchased the bundle of all cities: skylines, can't get enough of this game!"
11256,Only place where I can build my leftist utopia since my vote doesn't matter
11257,"it can be very confusing for new players, but once you get the hang of it its pretty pog"
11258,No boher m8 la'!!
11259,"yes good is build
many mods i like
"
11260,wys
11261,"Pretty fun, they have expanded it massively, so if you want way more to customize or build, buy the DLCs"
11262,"The best city simulator to the date with a huge number of mods on the workshop that let you play the game in your unique way. The Youtube scene is equally large with content creators like 'Biffa' and 'City Planner Plays' constantly pumping out content to show you the ropes.

If you want to build a city in 2022, this is the game for you.

+ Huge modding and content community
- The number of DLCs, some add more value than others, read up before buying."
11263,"Great game , could be better"
11264,yet another dlc purchasing simulator
11265,"You'll spend hours playing this game.

Granted, most of those hours will be spent trying to rework your road systems, but you will nonetheless spend hours playing this game."
11266,good
11267,Gr8 Game
11268,By far the best city builder i have ever played.   Hours of great fun .   Wth the great workshop library you are only limited by your imagination.

11272,Amazing
11273,cities skylines is a pretty fun game you can do anything you want in cities skylines
11274,Just a good game.  There is a lot of support from content creators to inspire you to build your own city.  Very relaxing.
11275,This game is good. I give this a thumbs up!
11276,Yissss boeld da city yissss it is to be stronk
11277,Game is unplayable even without mods! Fps always drop when you hit 5k population. Not worth to buy 0/5 !
11278,I absolutely love this game - when I play .. I can get lost in this game for hours :) I really have a hard time with the traffic but that's user error on my part lol
11279,"I love the game, but the stupid Paradox launcher won't let me launch it!
What's the point of buying games and then seeing them broken after release for no good reason? 
Death by launcher...."
11280,It is a very good game there is some problems you need solve but it’s not that hard
11281,I love city builders and this one looks very promising
11282,it is cool to build stuff
11283,buildings
11284,AMAZING
11285,"I loved this game. It's a bit difficult, but anyone can get the hang of it. Turn down the graphics settings on Mac."
11286,nice chilled game
11287,Awesome game once you start using Mods.
11288,"Super chill, may lose track of time while playing. Great game."

11290,"Absolutely recommend. Probably the best city-building game that I have played. The base game is well worth it, but I would also recommend Green Cities, Mass Transit, & Parks DLCs as my top three (in that order)."
11291,Best city builder game out there. With excellent mod support.
11292,Great game. Lots of mods :)
11293,Best city-building game I have ever played.

11317,the city has a skyline
11318,"i enjoy it
"
11319,Really great game!! I can play for hours on end with no troubles! 10/10 would 100% download in a future life.

11335,Utterly addictive.
11336,great game
11337,A beautiful city-building-game/resource management game. Very addictive. You can spent hours and hours in the game and it wont get boring.
11338,p a b l o
11339,"Interesting game, can go into so much depth with the details which all have effects and consequences. Looks good, lots of mods for even more detail."
11340,I loved the older city builders. How fantastic is it to finally build curved roads! Now if we could just make oddly shaped buildings and land plots...
11341,Amazing!

"
11351,"THE city building game. There is no competitor at this scale. I hope they come out with another one dynamic seasons, though."
11352,"A great game for anyone. Fun gameplay and allows you to build in various styles, whether its detailed or building a large metropolis. The large modding community adds endless customizability and replayability and the other communities are supportive and amazing.
And while I only have 10 hours in the game (as of now, all in a couple of days), I've easily spent hundreds of hours watching YouTube videos and interacting with various CS communities as well as some time playing on the Epic version.
Tl;dr, great game, 10/10 would recommend, especially if its on sale."
11353,played for over 1000 hrs never gets boring and enjoy sorting out traffic
11354,fantastic city builder
11355,"I always liked the idea of good urban design, while I can't get a good sidewalk or bicycle path in real life where i live, might aswell create that in Cities: Skylines"
11356,YUHHHHH 😌💅✨
11357,yass!!!!
11358,didnt like it during lunch but played again now and im loving it. scratches that ol' SimCity itch and then some.
11359,imo the best city simulator out right now.
11360,"good game. fucking terrifying dlc.

overall:
8/10"
11361,best  city game out there
11362,"everytime i build a city to a stable point i get scared and make a new one

9/10 better than SimCity2013(i have 1000 hours in that game because @@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@)"
11363,like a kid in a candy store
11364,"Great city builder, that allows you to play with big city/districts planning. The most valuable part for me is planning roads/freight/public transport of different kinds and dealing with all ongoing challenges of growing city up to 100.000 habitats. I really like these games with scenarios and here you have them but only with certain DLCs. But this one was ok to play even without scenario facing all challenges of growing cities. I also liked that even without having all DLCs, some features of them are granted to you for free.

9/10"

11368,100% worth it but it is typical paradox to lock all the good features behind dlca but if u buy dlcs buy them on sale but i love this game so much i own it on every platform but pc is by far the best because of modding capability
11369,"If you like to a massive traffic jam and desperately try and fix it with underground roads and mods, this is the game for you"
11370,too hard....no online mode...disappointed
11371,great
11372,it is a good game
11373,So many hours of fun. The possibilities are endless in Skylines. 10/10 would recommend.
11374,Best city building game for 10 year and more
11375,It's like Sim City only better. The only problem is that I feel like I need to have a degree in civil engineering to succeed.
11376,I love the way game developers are still updating the game and how its based on the player's needs
11377,Engaging and relaxing. Stimulates creativity.
11378,ok
11379,"It's a great game, but i can't recommend a developer that keeps adding paid DLC on a 7yr old game.

It has around 200 bucks of dlc, closing in on Sims4.

Be gone foul demon!"
11380,"I thought this will be a super easy game and will be a walk in the park but noooo......This game requires u to learn quite a lot of basic stuff that is found by watching like 3 YT videos and reading an entire page of how to play this game properly without going bankrupt
BUT after all that, once you know how to play it and build an entire city going bankrupt, this really feel a sense of accomplishment and joy thus making this game super fun and chill"
11381,it is a very fun game
11382,"Excellent replacement for the ""SimCity"" style game. Seems to always be a new DLC to buy, which gets annoying, but is also nice since there is constant development and new material. Definitely for a relaxing low stress game."
11383,"well i loved how i could create my own city from scratch and i can make a city with creative, meaning i have infinite money and all that stuff. the only thing that was really a problem for me was how much it lagged later on but i hope i fixed that problem by downloading it on a new computer. I also got this game on sale so i got it for like $7.99 so i was rather happy about that."
11384,"I really enjoy escaping to the new virtual world I am able to create in city skylines. With so much new content and user generated buildings themes and parking lots, it's a real joy building a new city over, and over again as each city is a new and different creation."
11385,good game
11386,"My favorite city builder ever. It only says 3 hours of playtime but that's because I played 1,000+ on PS4/PS5 with all the DLC. Maybe one day I'll migrate over to PC for mods but this is my ""chill in bed"" game while I listen to podcasts / etc. Nothing I've played since this came out has scratched the itch. Lots of work and love went into this game, and it really really shows, but you NEED to the DLC, in my opinion."
11387,beast
11388,yes
11389,this is a game
11390,nice game
11391,When every other game is shit rn. You can always rely on this game to distract you for a good amount of time.
11392,"Why can't i make a strip club in this game? 6/10
"
11393,i mak sity biig
11394,I dont even remember buying and playing this
11395,If you love cities and skylines then you'll love Cities: Skylines.
11396,ciTay
11397,best city sim goated lets go nice stuff bet dope cool great
11398,
11399,"Definitely the best of city building simulator, and because it's moddable, there are many options and possibilities on how to build your cities."
11400,"This is an amazing game with loads of customization through mods and content packs, there is endless creativity and an upgraded version of any other city building games. One of the things i like most about this game is the amount of possibilities that this game allows, more than any one person should be able to control. One of the things i dislike the game is that a few mods are needed to make road-snaps and other basic features realistic, things that should be added into the base game in my opinion. But overall I would give the game 5/5 stars, one of my favorite games to just sit and play."
11401,"So after 158 hours I think it's enough time to say what I need to say about this game, the game is what Sims City should have been when it comes to basic city management. But it does have it's up and downs, overall gameplay is what you expect and works great on low-end PC. Overall the game is good but the fact that mods are needed to get what you really want in the game is alarm raising. So would I recommend? Heck yes."
11402,amazing game
11403,"Pretty good game all around. I used to use Sim City 4 Deluxe edition to fill that city-builder itch, but this definitely surpasses that by far. If you are into city planning/road design this game can leave you playing for a long while. Unfortunately, it is one of the common paradox cases of, you need some of the DLC for the game to really be good, and there are also a lot of mods that feel almost necessary after you start to recognize the flaws in the game. 

My four absolutely necessary mods would be TMPE, which you can configure to have vehicles use more than a SINGLE lane on a  2+ lane road, real time, which changes the Civilian AI to actually run on a realistic schedule rather than spending two weeks in traffic,  and then road anarchy + move it, so you have better control of your road placement."
11404,best city building game
11405,"Made a city extremely self sufficient - happy residents with multiple public transportation options on a beautiful efficient road system. Placed a dam and caused a tsunami to wipe out the whole city.
10/10 recommend"
11406,"This is my favorite game I've ever played, truly amazing. Just hit 1,000 hours"
11407,its pretty good!
11408,"Every house in my cities are on the wrong side of the tracks.

10/10"
11409,"This game is the best city building game. The community out there is the best. You can implement modded things like roads, houses, structures, etc. You can even make a new city and in some time you can manage it so quickly that you'll never get bored. I understand that I have only 60 hours at the time I am writing this review. But I owned another city builder game wich was for free and I didn't like it. So I bought this game. It's awesome. 

The mechanics, the statistics, the graphs and everything is calculated. You feel like you are a city planned in real life. Manage productions, imports, exports and others.

I love this game.
RECOMANDED"
11410,"great experience played vanilla, but limitless possibilities with mods like move it, node controller, find it, etc. Tbh 70% of vanilla assets are ugly af."
11411,"nice calm game
"
11412,so much funnnnnn
11413,Amazing city building game and makes the boredom go away
11414,It's great
11415,"There really isn't much more to say beyond what's already been said. It's probably the best city planning game on the market right now, however it's worth noting that the capability of the game has pretty much reached it's limit. Overall though, still a great time, especially if you're looking for something to scratch the city planning itch with better graphics than the old Sim City."
11416,literally the best game i ever played
11417,"i would recommend this game if there were more assets put into the base game and if optimisation mods allowed the player to get achievements (since the base game isn't optimised and mods reduce loading time by half). 

This company is more than capable of making amazing games. i know there are hard working developers who work really hard for thier products. please design a monetisation model that isnt reliant of DLC's. 
"
11418,"Good, modern version of that classic city builder game"
11419,"It's fine if you build a small town of a couple thousand folks, some farmers, and call it a day.  A town of any size, especially one suggested by Cities Skylines, will be crippled by the poorly implemented traffic model, needs, desires, never mind industry.  There is no city in practice that requires several Level 1 Trauma Centers to serve a population under fifty thousand, with the population still complaining about medical care.  Nor does there need to be a funeral parlor on every corner.  Good ideas, terrible implementation.  I have just been advised the pending airport developer.  You have to be kidding, stop screwing around with traffic and transit infrastructure, especially in so much detail.  Regardless of how many flights arrive and depart, the citizens and trucks are far to dumb to use it with any semblance of efficency."
11420,"This is a great game... but over years i slowly turned into cancer. The DLCs are overpriced cookie-cutter garbage, nothing new happened in the game gameplay-wise in five years, and the only thing keeping this going are modders.
Game is not made by Paradox, but it definitely is a Paradox game.

Eventually it's just going to get replaced by a dumbed-down sequel of questionable quality.
Don't be like me, don't invest money and time into this, great game, but not worth the baggage and the money.
"
11421,"This game is awful, I wanted to get some sleep last year, but I had one more thing to do in my city, and now it is 2022. I need sleep, this game should go away."
11422,"I would not recommend if you want a simple game of building a city.

For one, there are several bugs ruining the gameplay, and the devs don't care. All they do is release new things via DLC, which brings me to my next point.

The game is not technically P2W, but the swaths amounts of DLC in the game ruins it. Now I know you would be saying ""But you can just get mods in the workshop."" This is true, but that does not mean there should be 15+ DLC packs. Several of them look like they deserve to be in the base game, like snowfall, after dark, and some of mass transit.
I blame Paradox for a lot of the 1st point, and all of the 2nd point. Its just their way of marketing, and it is a bad way.
EA is a bit better, since they actually try to fix their games.

And I don't even want to start with the loading time. Without the Loading Screen Mod, it might as well take 15+ minutes.

Overall, good idea, terrible execution by the developers. I would get a refund but I have played well over 2 hours and had the game for much more longer than 2 weeks.
And don't hate on this review just because I have a different opinion."
11423,i have all the dlc i cant stop playing help :(
11424,"One of the best city-builders I've played. So much customization and control, the realism is fantastic. A very steep learning curve, I had to restart my city a few times after learning new things and realizing I had set myself up for failure. But a lot of satisfying gameplay to be had.

My one complaint is with road construction. Curved roads and angled intersections often don't seem to build consistently or behave the way you would want them to. Hoping that's just another learning curve that I'll get to."
11425,So far not to bad haven't got into the harder levels yet but enjoying it so far.
11426,Good city game for gamers
11427,mmm infrastructure
11428,"Best citybuilder there is, traffic AI can be a bit annoying though. It's practically impossible to have good traffic flow in your city without traffic mods."
11429,"Fun game, but totally unplayable without the DLCs and MODS.
You need mods to have your city function properly, and all the DLC's combined make the game expensive AF.

Therefor I am not recommending, especially since Paradox prefer making more and more DLCs and other milk cows (Content Creator Packs, which basicly are mods being removed and added as DLCs). 
If they would fix the traffic system for instance, that would be a game changer..."
11430,"This game is the child of SimCity and it couldn't be better.  I have spent close to 100 hours playing this game and I still come back for more and continue to buy expansion packs.  The intellectual pursuit this game gives can fill up a young brain for hours upon end, and I find that to be a sign of an excellent simulation game.  This game is overall super-mega-excellent!"
11431,"Its a good quality game, calming to play and its fun with all the options ou have in the basic game. Mods are also fun to play with."
11432,Yet another virginity simulator from Paradox interactive.
11433,"made a giant roundabout city where people could never leave, like some sort of city-esque purgatory, then slam dunked 4 meteors on that sum-b and called it a day"
11434,"This is a great game. I love city builders this game is truly a work of art. Purchasing the DLC's make the game 10X better in my opinion. Not all of the but most of them. I would recommend this game to anyone would like to take there time and really make a masterpiece and go crazy with all types of mods and ideas. You mind can run endless playing this game. great game, highly recommend"
11435,very fun i love kill all of my sims
11436,"good management game
"
11437,Very nice game
11438,"Great game, also get mods. Not vital but makes the game more entertaining after you play the default game."
11439,"Hmmm, not sure if it's any good. Need to play a little bit longer. [i]Just one more map[/i]..."
11440,Best city builder ever made. Will forever set the bar for the genre.
11441,I love it
11442,"1900 plus hours.
Yeah, I got my moneys worth.
All DLC except the radio stations (CSL music mod, my own music collection for the win!)
Super easy to mod (64 script mods, 2065 assets currently).

My main criticism is simply I wish it were better optimized.
Hopefully they write their own game engine for the sequel, and optimize the hell out of it!

Not perfect but the best city builder to date!"
11443,Best city builder imo
11444,"i guess i enjoy the game somewhat, 10/10"
11445,build giant shitcano break shitcano people die in shitnami
11446,muchos funny
11447,yes👍🏻
11448,"Not a bad city planner but has problems with how some of its simulations work. The plague at 7500 citizens is stupid and the fact that not catering to a new thing can ruin your entire game is nonsensical. It's excessive portrayal of industrial pollution leads me to believe the developers have never even seen a factory and the tiny amount of space results in your city being very, very cramped."
11449,"Top
"
11450,I grew up on SimCity and it's successors.  This is hands down better than all the SimCity versions. Creating the city in a way that you dream is wonderful and as a big picture person this really gives me a happy place to go to from time to time.
11451,goood game
11452,pretty chill
11453,One of my favorite games of all time! Fun with civil engineering and peaked my interest in the topic
11454,The Game is great you can control and setup your very own cities the dlc packs are great but if u dont have money u can use some basic mods in the game to help you
11455,it is a nice game
11456,Best City builder game out there.
11457,"yes, just yes"
11458,cool game
11459,Great game
11460,Tried a variety of suggestions ( Steam and Paradox are NO HELP ) 4.5 Hours of wasted time and MONEY.
11461,Make it so that i can get achivements with traffic manager
11462,5
11463,Love it
11464,"so much to do in this game 
and so many mods 
lots of fun"
11465,"Been playing this for HOURS. It's so much fun!
One bad thing about this is a lot of DLCs. New players wouldn't know which dlcs to buy first without watching a tier list of DLCs on Youtube."
11466,"Rally good. A nice city building simulator that you can spend quite a lot of time with, actually.

Of course, being the Paradox game that it is, there are the unnecessary, just barely cheap and quite frankly mostly mediocre add-ons. However i never minded them much. Buy them if you really want to, but you definitely don't need them."
11467,I like the creativity aspect of planning and budget plans. Good game.
11468,Super addicting but after a while theres nothing much to do without the DLC's and also you cant unlock all achievements without the DLC's
11469,One of my favorite games!
11470,Decent game
11471,Watched a few guides. Easy enough to get into with a lot of depth. Good time killer.
11472,Fantastic SimCity clone that fixes a lot of problems in that game.
11473,noice
11474,"Well after 260+ hours and the care that Colossal's has always put into this game is why I always come back. Gearing up for Airports as i might dump another 40 + hours in on release. Looking forward to Cities 2, make it happen!"
11475,"At the time of writing this, I am just re-starting my Cities: Skyline adventures. After 300+ hrs I needed a break, but the pull hes been strong and I must relent. ;) With the mods and assets available, this is more than a game, it can be a piece of art."
11476,very nice  you like sim city you will like this.
11477,Really fun and extremely addicting!
11478,"Great game to sit back and relax to while you build a city
"
11479,If you want this game to be better add mods.
11480,amazing
11481,Easily the best city builder you can get right now
11482,EXCELLENT PLANNING GAME
11483,"Absolutely the best game to ever exist with so much personality! You get to create cities just the way you want them to be, with so many different items to play with and so many more you can get with the DLCs and the workshop! 100% recommend, this game is an experience everyone needs to have!"
11484,I like building prisons for only coloured people
11485,i just love making cities

11491,Amazing city builder. Spiritual successor to the Sim City games I grew up with. It scratches the itch I get when I feel the need to improve the urban design in my own real life city. Very cathartic. The only thing missing is the ability for multi-zoned areas (e.g. commerce on ground level and residential above). An otherwise perfect game that I can get lost in for hours at a time.
11492,epic gamer
11493,Core game is an OK city sim but I cannot recommend due to heavy monetization including selling workshop content as paid DLC. I generally do buy DLC for games but this game has a price tag over two hundred dollars.
11494,Best city simulation game since the earlier SimCity games.
11495,"Fantastic controls, engrossing gameplay. Love it."
11496,very fun game cuz i payed for dlcs :)))))
11497,Love the game!
11498,"this game is 95% behind DLC paywalls
you want the whole thing you gonna drop 500 dollars and for what
another city builder
and then you STILL gotta log in with a different service
sorry but no"
11499,yes
11500,im addicted
11501,"SimCity - and EA - can walk away in shame, Cities: Skylines remains the new king of city building economic simulators, ever since it came out. Still strongly recommended."
11502,Such a good game I played it for 6 hours straight. Dead Serious.
11503,Cool
11504,"Damn this game is so fun. This is probably the best city building game which I've played. Having that much dlc is the only downside for me. Even if you are bored, you can access many new maps or content from the workshop."

11516,"Great game for chilling out and using your imagination. Endless possibilities can be achieved through the great community workshop and inspiration from the content creators on Youtube such as Biffa and Imperatur. When no other game hits, Cities Skylines is the perfect game to fill the void. 

Base game is great as is, but i highly recommend using workshop mods and assets to take it to the next level once you learn the basics!"

11525,"Bought this game on sale and later purchased the Snowfall and Mass Transit DLCs. Then, later after getting a beefier PC i realized that this game was some of the best money I've ever spent, the game has always given me such a degree of comfort that satisfied and settled the inner kid in me that always wanted to be a city planner or architect. the  vast community made content only improves the game more. i definitely recommend getting this game if you're like me and you've always had that small itch to intricately design a city from the ground up."
11526,This game is really fun. I haven't had any problems within my 40 hours of playing. When I started I was a little confused about how the water and electricity system worked. But it is not hard at all.
11527,"This game is what every person growing up with the SimCity franchise always dreamed that city builders would be in the future.

What started out as a homage to one of the greatest management sim franchises, has far surpassed its predecessor. The vast modding community helps to push the limits even further to create a truly incredible experience.

Buy this game."
11528,Whoop
11529,pretty good
11530,city go build
11531,noice
11532,Pretty awesome if you're a perfectionist and want to go simply crazy
11533,"fantastic city sim, complex and fascinating. years of your life put to good use"
11534,"The based game alone is the best city simulation game ever made. The progression flows smoothly once you've mastered traffic. With mods that are always up to date and new assets releasing constantly. The replay-ability is endless. 
The challenges of building a city and attempt to add realism to it, is substantially rewarding. Starting from nothing (no unlocks to start and unlimited money off), gets you super invested into your city and is how I've enjoy'd this game for hundred's of hours.


DLC's I think are must haves: Industries, Parklife, Mass Transit, and Campus"
11535,you can name your city gayville. big thumbs up from me
11536,yes
11537,good time pass
11538,"So fun and the modding abilities bring endless joy and creativity to this already blast of a game, good job paradox."
11539,"Its like Legos but free, 10/10"
11540,Incredibly fun
11541,building
11542,"This is definitely one of the most comprehensive, clean and functional city builders to date. 
with DLC and mods it's quite easy to play the way you like. 

The water physics are really the only negative for me."
11543,Very fun. I've wasted a ton of time playing this game.
11544,oh boy
11545,good game
11546,Amazing
11547,"With mod support, this city building and management game has unlimited replay-ability. If you enjoyed the original Sim Cities games, this game is a must-have for you!  
Though the game is pretty straight-forward and simple to learn, the difficulty level can be scaled with mods, to make it easier or harder as needed.  You'll never run out of new content to enjoy, as there's an endless list of workshop mods to try out and new DLC are dropped frequently."
11548,"Probably my favorite sandbox/creative game ever along with the likes of Minecraft.

Been playing it since almost launch and keep getting addicted, well worth a buy - especially during sales.

The only complaint really is the usual Paradox Interactive milking of DLC, so look for a list of the best DLC to get before buying any. Looking forward to the sequel when it does come!

Don't forget to have a decent amount of ram (16+) if you want to get a decent amount of addons."
11549,Build it and come they will
11550,"Get the DLC on discount. 
Other than that...this game is practically flawless"
11551,city big
11552,city
11553,"i wonder what it like in real life?
There's corruption, drug rings, embezzlement. Going to small, going to big."
11554,meteors
11555,"Make a city, then destroy it with meteors."
11556,This is a game you can play in many different ways.  The number of community mods is in large part the reason for the flexibility.
11557,fun i love this game
11558,"In 2022 it's still a fantastic game, but of course not flawless and not cheap if you want the shed load of DLCs.
For some reason I've never really paid much attention to it for several years. But now I'm having a blast with it. 
Can absolutely recommend it"
11559,"i love polluting the water and ""accidentally"" killing all of my citizens, then hopping on my pc and getting on cities skylines"
11560,You will lose days of your life in this game.
11561,ok
11562,I am really enjoying this game.  As a former Simcity player this is better.
11563,100% Recommended
11564,"Very engaging and realistic.  Community support of mods and assets really make the difference.  Memory consumption and slow loading times make it difficult to play on a laptop (unless it's a fully-loaded, expensive one) so if you want to update your city while visiting family, forget it.  Speak with your family instead.  ;-)"
11565,"Pretty good, Main Game DLC is fairly priced unlike games such as the Sims 4"
11566,"all good, but it deserves a 2nd part already. too many DLCs"
11567,"Just getting started.  Where has this game been.  Love, Love it."
11568,Best city-building game I've played yet.
11569,I liked the how yopu can easily create indricate cities
11570,10/10 I love it even though it took me a couple tries
11571,Very Good
11572,"the best city building game ever existed !
specially with mods and  assets 
i wasn't able to play it for along time now because the game keeps crashing and i couldn't figure out what asset is causing this error :("
11573,Sempre quis saber como é ser um administrador de cidade. Só nao durante um ciclo de catastrofes naturais com direito a robos equipados com raio laser com vontade de matar. Shout out pro prefeito de brumadinho.

11575,Just a great overall city builder
11576,Great fun!
11577,"Cities: Skylines is to the city builder what World of Warcraft. It's the ultimate champion. I think the only  weak point for city skyline is that it's way too easy and even if you don't care, you will not die."
11578,it good
11579,"Had a chance to play it, unfortunatelly not much since I overestimated my PCs capabilities. The time I did play it, it was amazing and fun. When I will buy a better computer I will play it and I will abuse of the mods that can be added, becasue they really are a piece of work as well. The game is fun, challenging and can be detailed. It is a marathon not a sprint and that is what I love most."
11580,"Have always been a huge fan of this style game and game play. After Sim City, I was looking for another type of city builder and this is the one. Would deff recommend this game to others that enjoy city builders.

( *PSA* Watch out for the Power and Water meter policy, sent me into a hella debt, but I did forget to read the discription of the policy lol"
11581,Really fun game to waste hours on.
11582,Very Nice!
11583,it's a paradox game about building cities. what's not to love?!
11584,Haven't played as much on pc as I have on different consoles but this is by far the best city builder sim game that I've came across
11585,Sandbox city building with depth

11593,"このタイプのゲームをするのは初めてです。
ゲーム内のハウジング要素などが好きなので「好きな街を作ってみたい！」と思って始めたのですが、実際は攻略要素が強くゲームの都合に合わせて構成する必要があるためあまり自由度はありません。
それは私の認識不足なので構わないのですが、非常に気になるのがAIの挙動です。
特に車の動きがおかしく、目の前にあるにも関わらずものすごく遠回りしたり、施設につながる行き止まりの道があると直進すれば良いところをわざわざ行き止まりまで進行してUターンするといった挙動を見せ、目的地にたどり着かないことすらあります。
これに、非常に多くの消防・埋葬・ごみ処理の設備を必要とするゲームシステムと合わさり、それらが紛れようのない一本道で通行することで処理できるような街作りをせざるを得ず、合理的でもなければ美しくもない上に、自由度も低く、攻略を目的とする人でなければ楽しめない、と感じました。"
11594,"This game is very good, but the only problem I see is that when you buy DLC's you might be dissapointed and have to buy more, always check the content on outside sources before you buy."
11595,its fun
11596,traffic bad
11597,good intro into the horror fps genre
11598,Great game But once you start getting big you screw it up well i do... ok bye and buy the game it is really good at wasting your time on useful things that you could be doing
11599,yes
11600,I think i am starting to get better at this game now
11601,"An addictive little city builder. I still pop in every once in awhile to check on my town.

5/5"
11602,"Hands down the best city builder with endless possibilities (especially when you include the most active modding community, by far)! Could not recommend more. 

Only warning I'll give is that the game does have a bit of a learning curb to it. But once you get the basics, you won't be able to stop."
11603,I
11604,fun
11605,good game
11606,Bought this game after Maxis Fouled up Sim City and I am never going back to Maxis. It's not just the creating of a city but the solving of it's problems I have learned so much about planning and layouts I just can't get enough of this game. A great way to get lost for the weekend.
11607,"AWESOME GAME
"
11608,this is my favorite game you can play for a good bit and not get bored
11609,Amazing game.
11610,"Immersive game, lots to do. Lacking detailed instructions, however, YouTube videos filled in the blanks."
11611,"Build a city your way. Roads can get a little strange if you curve them too much but there are mods for complete traffic anarchy and grids work best anyway. I feel they don't give you enough early but it makes sense you first need to show you can design a suburb on a budget before you can start getting taxes, cover law enforcement and fire safety, get a university for office jobs, and then expand over to a forest area for more sustainable industry businesses. If anything it's too forgiving for not setting up public transportation or a neighborhood specifically made for low income and high pollution."
11612,Replaced Simcity so uhh ya its work a download
11613,it crashed EVERY TIME i open it i have 20 Bites of space and still
11614,fun
11615,If you like cities skylines you are gonna love this
11616,It's kinda fun I guess.  Workshop is fantastic.
11617,Super fun and relaxing game to play!

11619,I have played this game a lot over the years. Great for a relaxing game with no time limits. Very well done.
11620,my favourite part was casting meteors at my cities :)
11621,:(
11622,"great game
"
11623,love this game
11624,fun
11625,"This is a great City builder - for about 100-200 hours.

It severely lacks long term playability. Long term incentives. Unfortunately. 

I think they should include more crisis, like financial crisis or challenges that arise after along time."
11626,this is a cool game... building and playing... and put buses or trains well is amazing game!!!!!

11633,"I love the ability to mod this game, the features are great."
11634,Very nice game
11635,Fun.
11636,"Brilliant game, and yes it's totally normal and acceptable to start a brand new city... every... single... time... you... play :)"
11637,"Undoubtedly more successful than SimCity, Despite this it seems that a few things have been missed here"
11638,"OK this game is really amazing, how your city grows and how your city become more and more bigger !!
You need to take your time to make some really wise decisions for better future, like it or not this game is really complete, water, electricity, lots of pollution, traffic, etc ...
So you need to take your time to learn what to do for me it took like 3 times of loosing till I learned how to play.

The only problem with this game (it's not really annoying a lot but still it's a thing) is that it takes lots of the time to play, so I think who ever wanna play this game should have a plan for it like 1H per day so game doesn't get boring for you...

Enjoy making your Cities!!!"
11639,good

11645,"Perfect 
"
11646,"best games evar

11647,This is an excellent game to get lost in. The endless possibilities when it comes to designing your city from the most minute details to a city that can become truly a metropolis. You don't have to be a city planner to be able to make the most magnificent cities.
11648,the dreamcast fucking sucks lmao

11661,Fun game
11662,It's the best city building game on the market imho. Pretty much anything you can imagine you can build
11663,nice
11664,in this game you can be a capitalist god and the lives of thousands of civilians are in your hands. personally i like to force them to drive around in a circle for eternity while plaguing entire city blocks with industrial waste
11665,👍
11666,Love the creative aspect of this game.
11667,"Very nice game, a lot to do !"
11668,"Love it, great fun and I keep coming back to it."
11669,"Variety of building options, 360 degrees of freedom, and graphics"
11670,fun
11671,yeah. . . its alright
11672,"A modern Simcity with many features you'd expect, but many more too. The base game is solid no doubt, but now that I have all the dlc Cities Skylines truly shines and has hooked me with a mild addiction recently. There are so many changes in every dlc and all the little extras makes the gave feel more developed and improves the depth. Then of course the insane modding community has taken this game beyond what it could have been by itself.

Whether you want to be a bit more casual with your city or go crazy into the many details and mods, cities skylines is the definitive city builder of our generation."
11673,"buetiful game, i suck at keeping it running though"
11674,Awesome game.
11675,It's a detailed simulation game.
11676,"Not bad, spent a lot of time on this game and had a lot of fun too. I would recommend it for those who like to build cities and though it isn't perfect, you can mod it and adapt the game to your heart's content, and that is no bad thing."
11677,bad game wouldnt reccomend
11678,"Between all the games I have played for an embarrassing number of hours over the years, none have made me lose time without even thinking like this game does. Cities is near perfect, and the extremely accessible modding scene bridges that gap to perfection."
11679,Good
11680,its good asf
11681,This is one of the only games I love to play.
11682,Very fun and very addicting!
11683,Great fun constructive game
11684,"While the game is fun, unless you have a bit more than 8GB memory, then it's going to lag on you pretty hard. Otherwise, great game!"
11685,very fun
11686,Nice but complex to learn how to play

11701,Super fun.
11702,"this gane is great fun , if you liked simcity  you will love this game and its a far better improvement over simcity"
11703,fun
11704,"Very fun, it is good to have a game where you can build your own city"
11705,"i love this simulation! It gives me an outlet for my creativity, my need to to design and enforce my city planning ideas. I may not get elected in real life, but in this game i am the Supreme Leader. The graphics are excellent. The architecture is brilliant an inspiring. I enjoy the policies I can implement, however i wish the policies and sim community involvement was more complicated, i.e. the game is capitalist and  depends on expansion. It considers employment but it doesn't consider alternative forms of employment. For example, as a Supreme Leader i should be able make commercial and industrial workplaces worker cooperatives. There should be an option for democratic forums--atheniums, parliaments, democratic halls, etc...town halls, where sims are polled on certain policies based on algorythyms of past usefulness in a city--so that early beginnings would be important because early policies form culture. People are irrational and don't like change. i should be able to defund the police without total collapse of a city--this programming is political idealism. Although it was only when i defunded the police and my sims abondened the city that i was able to get my observatory and universal healthcare and rebuilt from there with police (unfortunatly).  I should be able to choose educational messages on my blimps and billboards and broadcast policy ideas with TV and radio stations which are no more than dummies. in this way i can ben political opinion in forums and in time maybe get the policies i want. I should be able to tyoe in policy arguments in these forums for sim consideration or choose from a bank of arguments to manipulate opinions. There should be consequences to my policies. Inequality. Protests. Unrest. TV and radion stations and newspapers should broadct news in the city reporting unrest and activism and policies and editorials. I should be able, as mayor/prime minister, to manipulate procedures in teh congressional halls to enact policy like cooperative work laws, unions, rent caps. if i starta city with certain policies it would carry forward in teh culture of its residents...e.g, ""harsh prison sentences"" is a strongman capaitlist conservative policy with no merit and in the game has no real function.  policies should gave consequences--uprisings in congress and the streets at times. cars burning. rioting when it gets bad. prisons should become overcrowded. Industry should have real effects on health and the HC system. If my HC is privatized and for profit many of citizens would not have healthcare and this should cause unrest, unhappines, and decline. Unlimited growth is unrealistic. It has consequences. the natural disasters DLC should be included in the game with a climate catastrophe element. Acid rain, severe and inclement waeather, flooding, forest fires, heat waves that kill offf the elderly and children and overwhelm the hopsitals, supply shortages, unrest...many of the mods and DCs addressed some of my ealry concerns but i have not seen anythign in the way of policy afformentioned. Gamers shoudl be able to form and/or choose a constitution for the city up and down the politcal spectrum--this constitution woudl guide policies and votes in the town halls. amendments should be possible. As it is wea are all authoritarian capitalists with god like powers--and that can be satisfying but its gets old. and makes th egame a sandbox rather than a challanging game. a gamer should have the choice to be an authoritarian capitlist or communist democrat with potential for small and sweeping changes in political atmosphere based on prior decisions and consequences. I should also be able to build my electrical network underground. If i can increase taxes i should be able to increase utility costs, place caps on costs, select rents and mortgages for properties and face those consequences. When i erect a highrise i should be able to select a range for rent. If my policies are socialist, perhaps housing is free. If hosuign is too expensive i should see homeless sims and crime rates. if HC and edu is too expensive on top of that i should have widespread unrest. A edu increased political parties should change and grow and public opinions should change. U should be able to choose if my college leans conservative or progressive or radically socialist--based on the founders's idealism. If I have churches in my citiy that relects public opion and influences politics. Looking forward to the Democracy DLC!"

11712,Very nice spiritual successor to the Maxis SimCity games
11713,"good game
"
11714,"You can burn a lot of hours on this game. Its a really good sim.

One thing to note, you arnt going to be getting crazy fps or usage on your hardware (at least for me I wasnt) due to it being a sim and not really needing crazy high fps. Using a RTX 3070 and R7 3800x I got about 45fps zoomed out and 30fps zoomed in using 35% utilisation on CPU and GPU (this is with a 80k population city) across 9 tiles. So as you can see you dont need a god tier setup to run this as it wont use all PC potential."
11715,Create and organize a city. Very relaxing.

11731,Jam Packed with customizable urban planning scenarios and on-board functional modding/CC.

I really enjoyed this game. Looks cool and gameplay is good as well. Do this, do that, make your citizens happy and grow up.

11761,"If you like other popular SIMulated CITY games, and you want to take the game even further, City Skylines is definitely the game for you.  I would highly recommend checking out the numerous videos on YouTube from city managers and super users.  They will show you the ropes and set you on the right path to designing incredible cities.  They will also show you amazing ways to modify and create stunning pieces of infrastructure for your city.  This game"
11762,yes its a good game ive played it for hours and i never get bord
11763,.
11764,"I've enjoyed it every once in a while. For me it isn't an every day kind of game because it does get repetitive. For me I'll play it once every other month for a ten hour stretch over two to three days and then not play it again for a while. 

Mods are really well put together for the game and make the game better but most disable achievements (I think)."
11765,"jik
make if that what you will"
11766,"Can't start the game because i can't accept the terms and conditions. EULA.

Funny. Or not ...

You need to view these terms. If you do, another window pops up. You read 10 pages of stuff. You want to return to the launcher and start, but ... well, you can't actually. Launcher says, i still need to view the EULA.

Allright then ... lets read the EULA a 3rd time then, shall we?"
11767,l
11768,"I love the game, just one thing isn't good for me, it is CONFUSING. I wasted a lot of time trying to understand the basics, a real tutorial or better text boxes in the tools will help.

I recommend, I like so much that I'm planning to buy the dlcs =D"
11769,"I would not recommend this game to nobody,It just does not work,i have uninstalled & re-installed the game sooooooooooooo many times,changed computers,paid for another copy for my son,,he gave up months ago,the same crap.over a week now it crashes on loading,removed all mods,run game with no mods same crap,sent the crash report to developer no answer.................LOL  Steam not there problem! Be polite OK. My son stop using steam a long time ago,"
11770,"This game is not only fun but educational in a small amount. The game teaches you budgeting, planning and many more skills. I'd definitely recommend this to everyone, atleast to try."
11771,":D
"
11772,"Not my cup of tea, but it's better than Simcity and many other city building games.

11775,"Ever since I've played this game, walking around outside hasn't been the same."
11776,Great Game
11777,verry well designed game however the amount of dlc content you have to pay for after buying the game could be a huge turn off. some of the older dlc content should get rolled into the base game.
11778,"I only play the vanilla,
fun game with limitation,
but at what cost?"
11779,its ok just not my style

11781,I like how you are incharge of every thing

11783,The best city-building simulator!
11784,"good game
"
11785,"Personally I don't find the game as replayable as some other city builder's until you maybe start messing around (with a lot of mods maybe), I'd also highly recommend against buying for default price, the game goes on sale often, I don't feel like the DLCs are very necessary for this one though."

11807,"Wow, this is unprecedented greed. Yall are crazy.. You just updated the graphics of sim city broke it down into its individual components  and monetized it to the tune of over $100. Are you seriously charging for disasters? It was vanilla content in sim city!  would not recommend, would encourage you not to encourage this crap with your dollar.

11811,ITS OKAY
11812,"Great game! If you were ever into toy trains and building model towns for your matchbox/hotwheel cars, this game can rejuvenate your imagination. This game is an extremely large sandbox. You can play it fast or you can take 2+ years on a project. It's like stepping into another dimension. The only frustration comes from within; ""ahh should have made that road larger,"" or the ""oh I can't believe I thought that would work."" 

Objective: Build a functioning city and grow your population. Or...don't grow it. You can stabilize it at a low footprint or you can even watch it fail. It's your prerogative. 

The game is pretty forgiving once you have some city money. I've spent many hours creating cities via Microsoft's Xbox Series S. The MODS are what brought me here to the PC game. I graduated to MODS!"
11813,good city builder
11814,"I love this game. Graphics are good but not too good which allow the game to be played on all ranges of computers/laptops. Its content is not too easy, but it is not hard either."

11838,"If you're into shooters or action games (I actually enjoy these as well, some of them anyway) or any genre's besides RTS, strategy, or building games this isn't your cup of tea. Now I liked simcity, it had its quirks, but it was the best city builder sim for me... that was until I played this. I've been hooked since I watched my first gameplay vid of it on youtube... It's like simcity if you could control everything. Most games have an end goal, this is one of those rare gems (imho) that doesn't really have an end goal, there's achievements, but you can keep playing after you get them all and it doesn't bother me at all. The new has since worn off. While I still play it's not as much. I've since bought close to $70 in DLC. You'll find several cons, such as Many DLC's with content you'll probably want. Most things as I've found through vet players on youtube can be done with the vanilla version of the game. I liked the game enough I bought more content for it if that tells you something. 

Content 8/10 with DLC's 10/10 
Gameplay 9/10 
Graphics 9/10

11845,booommm
11846,This is one of the best games I've ever played. This game allows amazing attention to detail and customization. The base game comes with everything you need and the dlc serve as option content that you may or may not want. The community is great with hundreds of great mods and thousands of great assets. I would highly recommend picking up this game
11847,deep enough to be interesting and free enought to be fun!
11848,"its pretty dope, worth it
"
11849,"I really like Cities: Skylines. I know I only have around 5 1/2 hours of gameplay at the time of this review, but I plan to start writing reviews at the 5 hour mark, and coming back to the review as time goes on (hoping to review the game in 5-10 hour increments). Anyway, I really like how you can be your own mayor and face real challenges that an actual mayor would experience. You can also create your dream city. Mines by the waterside which is a dream of mine it can get pretty hard when some stuff is happening and you can't figure it out, but that's what YouTube and the internet is for, right? Overall, I'd have to rate this game a 8/10!"
11850,nice
11851,its a good game
11852,yes
11853,"I don't know much more to say other than if you like city building games, this is a great one. The vanilla game is great so don't be discouraged by reviews talking about how it sucks how much paid DLC there is.

Side Note: This has been a great game to play with my partner whom has little interest in playing videogames."

this game made turn me in an anti-care urbanist thanks game very cool 

10/10 just don't install too many mods bc they takes like 10 years to uninstall bc steam wont let u uninstall of them at once
"
11867,i built a cemetery right next to an eldercare
11868,"This game is like league of legends with buildings. It really is the dark souls of city simulators. Play this game if you like terrible devs, a lack of communication, and assets from 2009. Thank you paradox for making the biggest game with the worst AI. Why is the traffic simulation so terrible? For a game that is all about realism, how come the devs assume that as soon as anyone sees a road, the part of your brain responsible for fine motor movement has an ischemic stroke? Yes, traffic engineering is a hard discipline, but it shouldn't be impossible where as soon as you build more than one road, all hopes of your city functioning at all are lost. There is no reason for this. Even without the artificial inaccuracy, building efficient traffic systems that also look good is hard enough that it balances itself out, the same goes for the other provided transportation types. If paradox really wants to make managing traffic non-trivial they could introduce rush-hour type scenarios or provide supply line consequences for late deliveries.

11871,"step 1: build a large mountain
step 2: add a deep indent into the mountain, go as low as possible
step 3: begin building your city below the mountain. make sure all raw sewage drains into the mountain (remember to have 10+ pumps for optimal sewage output)
step 4: continue building your city
step 5: watch as the raw sewage drains over the mountain, onto your city and causes mass destruction
step 6: rinse and repeat
"
11872,"I'd recommend this game if you can catch it on sale and if you like solving problems of urban planning and logistics - especially if you can get it at a reduced price. When I bought this game, I wasn't sure if I could get into yet another city building game. I was wrong - at least until the novelty wore off after about 2 weeks. Then I started thinking ""What is the point?"".  The only point, really, is building cities and then admiring your progress. For me, that's not enough to keep me playing, long-term.  Only the traffic management held any interesting challenge, for me. Still, for the price I paid (around £5),  I got my money's worth of entertainment."
11873,You already know this is a great game. Just get it already!
11874,awesome game
11875,Easy to spend hours playing without realizing. Much more in-depth than I initially thought.
11876,"its fun. the electric system was confusing for awhile, then i realized i was an idiot. 8/10"
11877,This game is a little too complex for my taste.  I like to keep it simple.  The instructions for addition of electricity and water are too vague for easy completion.
11878,Best game ever!!!
11879,Very enjoyable game
11880,"Truly the ultimate sandbox city building & simulation game to date, yes it optional to have the assists off and make it more of a challenge without sandboxing through. Even the base game is pretty good without The DLCs however they do enhance the game play, I wouldn't worry about the radio stations just get a workshop mod for those. In fact the steam workshop is what makes this game the best on this platform compared to the consoles 《especially TMPE [Traffic Manager Presidental Edition] 》

I'd recommend checking reviews and the description of any of the dlcs before you buy, see if the contents are worth it to you, and/or wait for a sale"
11881,This game is very good! i would prefer PC over Console since I have both and because its pretty obvious.... PC has mods and console has.... nothing
11882,I really enjoy this game! There is some things I would change or add but maybe one day it will happened.
11883,"good game, cant get 99999999 people though"
11884,roads and houses and stuff.. traffic jams and whatnot..dog park on fire.. idk i kinda dig it
11885,sick
11886,yes yes fun
11887,"This game is one of the most incredible works of art and passion by the modding community that I've ever seen. There are thousands of mods for every possible function you could think of that can make this into a city-sim that is head and shoulders above everything else on the market. 

However, the base game itself is kinda wonky and has a lot of problems. You pretty much need mods and DLCs to get the best out of the game. 

Some other things to note: 

CPU Heavy, make sure you have a decent one 
IRL Weeks will pass in mere minutes as you struggle to perfect your highway interchange. 
No easy way to fix or undo things, you can utterly ruin your own city or road network by accident and it's not gonna be fixable. Just remember to save before massive changes.
Traffic management and AI is hot flaming garbage in vanilla (but there's mods for this, of course).
Wait for the DLCs to go on sale and then buy them. You can save a lot of money that way. 
"
11888,"good game
"
11889,BRRRR
11890,Poggers game would definitely recommend to people who like games in the City Builders genre.
11891,Really good game but DLCS are basically required to unlock the full experience of the game
11892,"I have a love-hate relationship with this game.

First, it is the most visually appealing modern city building there is.
But the population AI and traffic AI are just broken in this game.
Definitely the good thing is its active modding community. This game won't simply survive its reputation without mods.
The QOL mods addressed most of its issues, but not perfect.

Also, DLCs have been milked to extreme."
11893,10/10
11894,"Pros:
- Major creative opportunity with the perfect amount of challenge
- Lots of maps to choose from
- High levels of customisation through mods in the steam workshop

Cons:
- No longer loads up a small town when I have changed nothing since I last loaded the save file
- Adding mods can lead to the game freezing"
11895,"I have all major dlcs and even minor ones, but even after 750 hours with the game I still don't have even half of the achivments.

Put it this way I started out on Epic but had to come to Steam for controller support. It didn't take long to see the difference in Steam and Epic. I since uninstalled Epic and stayed with Steam.

11927,yes
11928,pretty good
11929,Only get on a discount. Unplayable since you can't even get water and sewage systems to work and people will leave your town. Hard to make money and you start out with little money. You will go bankrupt. You won't get better buildings since there is a population threshhold that you will never get to. Better to buy Simcity 4 than this.
11930,"Hundreds of hours between Steam and Xbox, and I have to say, this is one of my all-time favorite games. Nothing less than 5 stars. Everything you could want from a city builder and more, and the dev team is constantly adding new content even now so many years after release. Absolutely worth the money. Only addition I would LOVE to see is co-op mode so I can play with friends."

11942,just love it.
11943,"If you want the definitive city-building game for the the late 2010s and today then this is the game for you. The amount of depth, possible customization via the workshop, and freedom to do whatever you want makes Cities Skylines a truly addictive experience. I cannot recommend this game highly enough for those of you who enjoy city-building games."
11944,"This game was made in 2015. But right now is 2022 and this game is still the best in city building simulators. 
The game pays a lot of attention to details. You can customize almost anything. 
But, some mods are necessary, but they are free so thats ok. 
Unlike DLC's, because some of them are must have, like [b]Sunset Harbor[/b], [b]Campus[/b], [b]Industries[/b], [b]Parklife[/b], [b]Green Cities[/b] and [b]After Dark[/b].
Basically, in this game, only your imagination will limit you.
10 out of 10 for sure, one of my favourite!"
11945,I have not been able to use Cities Skylines with an iMac and track pad.   The streets will not adhere to the landscape.
11946,Top notch Mod community makes this very worthwhile to have.
11947,yeah great game I just really suck at it
11948,cool
11949,RAM dibayar fictional city

"
11951,love it !!!
11952,"Fantastic way to escape reality and lose thousands of hours to joyful creation, then decide you don't like it and start over for another thousand hours :)"
11953,fun to play super time consuming and very fun.
11954,"Awesome game. Not well optimised especially if you play with mods, but still great."
11955,"This game is an amazing spiritual successor to the Sim City of old. With the various options and mods, this game can appeal to a wide range of people. You can play it in a casual style of growing a city from your very first street, enable max realism and challenge yourself in creating a perfect city layout with burgeoning industry and perfect traffic (good luck with the traffic!), or turn off the money and achievement requirements and build an aesthetic paradise. 

The visuals are fantastic, and the simulation is really something else. I was surprised to find that the water level of bodies is dynamic, and you can end up overfilling or draining a lake without realizing it.

If there is one negative thing I have to say about it, it is that the game is dangerously addictive. On multiple occasions I have played through the night, not realizing that the sun was about to come up. Do not play on a work/school night!"

11960,I really enjoyed building cities!
11961,"I used to be a happy, pussy slaying man, until my elderly stripper grandfather showed me this game. Now i live in my moms basement instead of my dads and go on omegle at night to cure my crippling depression. But on the upside my city has a 70% traffic flow rate. fuck strippers"
11962,rjgsdh5esb
11963,"If you love city building and management and mods, give it a go...

I just like playing god :p"
11964,roads? where we're going we need roads
11965,this is a great game for everyone to play but its a bit hard for new people at the start but gets easier as you play more.
11966,not a fan
11967,fun at first but gets boring a bit later...
11968,yes
11969,Fun city builder
11970,"Incredible game and an astronomical experience. I would recommend this game to anybody that likes roam-free sandbox games, or people that just want to terrorize things you never thought you could even exhale wrong on."
11971,yea
11972,its fun
11973,"This game is op , when i saw this game for 4 $ i bought it and it was the first time im playing and i loved it i recomend this if you like tycoon or simulation. this supports in almost all device , my device has i3 but still play in max graphics with no lag"
11974,"I'll make it quick:
1. It's an absolutely amazing game. Without a doubt a million times better than SimCity (5).
2. Radio-Station- and Content-Creator-Packs are too expensive, even during sales.
3. The ""regular"" DLCs are great, but I'd wait for a sale, especially if you want them all.
4. It's amazing on it's own, but look at the workshop. It's crazy what some people have created."
11975,you can destory citys i like
11976,"one of the greatest games of all time. tho u gotta have a higher-end pc to play the game with a ton of mods.
-----------------------------------
 8/10
-----------------------------------
-1 cuz my pc fan go brrrr
-1 quite a few dlc's
+7 more addicting than candy crush
+1 TSUNAMIS"
11977,"I was always a SimCity Player, and always loved their platform. When I had looked into Cities, it was Cities XXL first. Didn't like it too much, but decided to give Cities: Skylines a better shot. Thank goodness I did. All aspects of this game are amazing. For a sandbox city builder there isn't much more you could ask for."
11978,game is fun
11979,What can I say? It's fun!
11980,"I am giving this game a negative vote, because after so many years the variety in buildings of the same level is still stunningly low. E.g. many houses at the first level are basically the same 3D model just with a different colour. This makes cities look pretty fake and boring"
11981,!
11982,"Watch This game on Youtube more than i play, mission accomplished"
11983,perfect
11984,"good fun game, takes a little to get the hang of though"
11985,"I purchased this game for PS4 but after playing, I decided PC would be better for me so I switched. PC is definitely better. Now I just have to learn the controls HA!"
11986,"I'd recommend this to any fan of the genre.  No bugs, great gameplay."
11987,"Every time I go Bankrupt I learn more from the city than I knew before. Finally I made a city that didn't become Bankrupt until I reached 2000 people. l.o.l! i recommend this game, why not!"
11988,"For people who enjoy open world games that allow so much room for creativity and imagination , Cities Skylines sure covers that. I'm a newer player myself however you can see the results of more experienced players just by a Youtube search of beautiful Cities Skylines. Just purchase all DLC packs for roughly $100 for unlimited play. You can get mods (add-ons) to further your creativity however I have not used any yet."
11989,
11990,good game with the best workshop on steam
11991,twas aight
11992,You can build whatever you can imagine.
11993,its a good game to let your creativitie let it self go i would recommend it if you like to make your own city/world
11994,y
11995,"Base game is fine, if you can get the DLCs its a really complete package.

I've spent/wasted a fair amount of time in university studying urban planning and transport design, and this game tackles an itch in my brain that I can't stop scratching.

If you like city builders and enjoy watching something grow over weeks at a time, this is a great game to pick up on sale. It's got some weird kinks and ways of handling certain things, such as population size and education, but none of these detract from what is a superb package, especially when considering the excellent DLC (each of which is partially included in the base game for free, as updates) and expansive steam workshop. I wouldn't still be playing if I didnt have my comfort mods (FPS boost & road anarchy are two big essentials to get started with, but there are about 30 mods currently enabled in my game)

I'll only stop playing this game once my mods collectively break all my saves or they release a new Cities.

I have a feeling the former is more likely."
11996,"very poggers and i love making cities

i spent 2x the game on dlcs and it has improved the game"
11997,"This is the greatest game I've ever played and no matter how much I play it, it's not enough. The mod community is spectacular and gives this game endless replayability"
11998,Extremely Addictive
11999,the best game ever for me try it
12000,Tons of fun
12001,if you turn on infininte money it is very fun
12002,Best city builder I have played so far
12003,Fun

12011,"Really fun city simulator that doesn't charge you an arm and a leg for DLC like a certain other game in the genre.  Get all the major DLCs when they're on sale for a complete experience, but vanilla can still be fun.  Workshop items really flesh out the game and give you more control that the base game lacks or doesn't execute quite well enough."
12012,city
12013,Great city building game!!
12014,"In the base game you are guaranteed to fail.  

Your city will die due to pollution, traffic, or stagnation (OR ALL THREE!!).  

Good News though!! You can avoid these issues by spending more of your money on the expansions!  

The developer has ensured their future meals are paid for by releasing the completed product one part at a time and charging you, the customer for the privilege of it!  

They formulated their product release exactly to gain the most income!  Do you want transit fixes for your game?  Buy not only the transit expansion but also other expansions to get key transit elements!  

Now they got you buying 2-3 expansions to fix one basic underlying game breaking issue that should have been patched into the base game.

I'm excited to see the piecemeal train-wreck that Skyines 2 will be!"
12015,Stupid Traffic man.... really though wtf.
12016,I bought the game with it being on discount. When it downloaded it kept on saying there was an error and it wouldn't let me play it. It's a good game but just made me mad.
12017,I spent my vacation week from my real job putting 40 hours into this game. Do i need to say more?
12018,very cool game lol
12019,good
12020,Buuy it ok!
12021,Paradox launcher
12022,amazing game
12023,ok
12024,"best game ive ever played! if you like building games, then this is the one, its more of a simulation than a game, it makes sim city look like that was from 20 years ago lol, i think ill still be playing this in 20 years its that good! I dont think would ever get old with the amount of things you can do, its literally endless"
12025,"i made 50 toll booths just to get into the city.
earning a lot of money
11/10 would do again"
12026,"This is a very fun game. I enjoy the challenge of figuring it all out. My 7 year old enjoys building his cities to. (Sure I have to help him get started and trouble shoot, but it's entertaining. :) )"
12027,very good
12028,its gud
12029,I made penis town
12030,"City building game. Road & track building needs work.
Biggest issue is the screen turning white every time you want to place a building.
Makes it hard to see needed details to place buildings.
What were the devs thinking?

12031,"50 hours
25 hours of the gameplay is traffic management simulator"
12032,This game makes you think how can water be so stupid.
12033,Mayor kinda sus
12034,"I love creating, building, designing and this game has it all. This feeds my creative bones with so much fulfilling content, especially with mods."
12035,nice game
12036,"Old enough that I played the original Sim City when it was current.  This is the logical evolution, especially with all the amazing mods and assets available in the workshop."
12037,Easy to play.  Reminiscent of Sim City
12038,very intuitive tools to build the cities
12039,Absolutely amazing. Fun for hours with a bit of strategy in it. The very definition on a city designing game.
12040,The only paradox game i've spent money on. Vanilla game is pretty bland but you wont find a better city builder sim.
12041,amazing. like woah
12042,Good
12043,"a poem

*INHALES...*

expenses suck"
12044,great
12045,"
This game is highly addicting if you love attention to detail and almost endless possibilities. There is a bit of a learning curve, but it's an enjoyable one that can be very rewarding as you progress through different stages of building up your cities. At the time of writing this, I have over 200 hours of game time and I'm still learning tricks and techniques to building better, more efficient cities, and I love it!"
12046,very good
12047,Fun game.
12048,"played it for 7 hours straight, no auto-save, are you kidding me? no basic game functions, pure trash"
12049,"noice

12055,"Ok, this game is just amazing since added with steam workshop this can stream to hours of endless fun. happy new years!"
12056,mods good
12057,best gam
12058,Amazing game with lots more potential.
12059,Urban Planning
12060,This game is fun ... but I feel like they could improve in certain areas... for me at least .. maybe a way to automate bus services and other services instead of having to manually create them
12061,"I do believe I used to enjoy Cities Skylines. I've played a lot of it. I tried getting back into again recently and it just doesn't click.

I think this game received the praise it did because it was emerging from the 'smoldering ashes' that was SimCity 2013. It was touted as the game that put the final nail in the coffin of that game. The top steam review from this game reinforces that idea with the statement that someone from Finland got sick and tired of the SimCity debacle and made a game that people actually wanted or what that game should have been. But SimCity was exactly what it wanted to be, a city builder, and gave you the ability to create a city, however small it might be, you could feel some what attached to, and I do believe it was quite good at it. I believe the game itself and not the mystic that was built around it is better than this game on it's face.I think that if Cities Skylines came out today, it wouldn't get the praise that it did in 2015. 
So I think my issue is I don't know if this game is actually fun or not. The vanilla game just seems so bland to me now coming back to it. It just seems like it has no soul, no real purpose or real difficulty, and you'll probably get bored with the vanilla game pretty soon because it devolves in what every city you'll ever start in this game becomes; a traffic manager. And if you don't fit into that niche it just isn't fun to combat the traffic that makes no sense. So you'll go to the Workshop and get some mods, including 'essential' ones like the Traffic Manager President Edition, whose goal is to combat the seemingly broken base game traffic AI and this is the problem I have with Cities Skylines. And I love mods, I love the people who make them and think it's a great thing that people who make mods for free out of the love of the game or love of the art of making them exist. I love mods that enhance a game and make it that much better. 

The issue I think I have with this game is that it feels like it needs mods, and it feels like you're battling the base game, like you're fighting against what it is and what you (and many others) think it should be. I look on youtube and I see people making these amazing cities and I think I want to do that too. Then I see the absolute truckload of mods you need to even get close to that, and then the whole traffic thing which you'll have to deal with (and it's never fun) and the mods you need to get to make a realistic looking and functioning city just seem to foster the notion that Cities Skylines on it's face is too simplistic and too thin to be very fun on it's own. I can see so much potential in a city building game that gives you freedom like the amazing mods of this game can give you, and the ability to make a beautiful, realistic city without the barrier to entry being so high and confusing like Cities Skylines. Sometimes I feel like I'm just not understanding the game or missing something perhaps, and the popularity  of it eludes me sometimes, but then I remember it's the mods that prop this game up. It's always the mods."
12062,"It's like sim city but offers more options.
It's much more realist."
12063,Absoloutly worth the money! Best city builder out there!
12064,Great City builder. Modding community is also amazing
12065,OFCC ITS GOOOD
12066,Fun city builder.  Get it on PC cause mods are a must
12067,Description
12068, Just a great sandbox style game. Hugely customizable. Fun and frustrating at thew same time due to how complicated it is to make a properly functioning city that is also realistic. Its a very resource hungry game. Do not expect to make any large cities with more than just a few mods without at least 16GB ram.
12069,"A great game if you want to take on managing a city, or just to do something relaxing."
12070,It is so fun if you are bored and looking to invest some time
12071,Really fun!
12072,awdawdadasdwada
12073,"If you never thought this kind of game would be for you, but enjoy anything that takes a moment of thought for genuine, satisfying reason - this is actually THE game
"
12074,f you played SimCity this game takes it to not only another level but a whole new dimension.   Great game!
12075,
12076,"لعبة ممتعه 
enjoyable game
highly recommend"
12077,great city builder game takes a second to learn but worth it
12078,Simply put this game is the best city builder game out there currently. EA dropped the ball with sim city and this game picked it back up and made it better ten fold.
12079,"amazing 
"
12080,gud
12081,its good!
12082,so much detail
12083,"This game was good ... long ago ...

I do not know when it changed, but when I reinstalled it today out of nostalgia it first opened some launcher that wanted to trick me into creating a account and bombarded me with ads for other Paradox games. You do not need a account, but when you then boot up the game you are forced to agree to one of the most agressive EULA I have seen. You can NOT turn off data collection and monitoring in any way.

Oh, and of course there are now tons of DLC, some of which are only there to solve problems I remember from having back when I played the game. Traffic, Age, Garbage, Pollution, that sort of stuff.

I now regret paying money for this game, the developer shows a despicable amount of greed and I will never support this kind of behaviour."
12084,Better than expected
12085,"I've played Cities: Skylines on XBox and loved it. After watching a lot of videos of gameplay on PC, I knew I had to try it. It's so much better!"
12086,"Pretty fun and challenges your imagination, the only issue I've experienced is the fact that the roads can be a bit bugy, but a few mods can fix that easily."
12087,Its good. I bought this after watching RTGame play it and I have enjoyed the limited time spent in it so far.
12088,"i love this game,im a begginer im still learning,but the game is fire!everyone buy it:)"
12089,"too good game
"
12090,This is an awesome game
12091,Ever wondered why cities are shaped the way they are? Ever wondered how you'd do when managing poop disposal? Are you a creative designer or logical planner? All questions answered and more. Great game!
12092,"i actually really like this game its easy, its fun, it makes u actually invest some hard work into it and i personally love it and i very very much recommend that game"
12093,"[h1] Yes [/h1]

"
12094,I like fudge... also turtles
12095,very nice
12096,The game is good but the DLC is still expensive
12097,I would recommend this game if you had a high end computer or a gaming PC as you can still play the game with a lower end one but not download any mods and that was the only reason i got city skylines on the computer. I wish you could get refunds on steam but anyway this is a fun game and i have about 10 hours play time on my PS4 and have a couple DLC's. Its also super laggy and as have only played about an hour of this game the rest was loading in.
12098,GOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOD
12099,"I want to note that I have way more than 13 hours on this game. It has been way more educational than I would have ever guessed. This game is for building American style cities, it doesn't really have much to offer in terms of other design philosophies or mixing of residential and commercial stuff into one district (they are always separate). I love this game so much and it is one of the most fun tycoon/sandbox games I have ever played. It is extremely relaxing. I recommend this to anyone, especially if you can catch the base game on sale."

12133,"It's a good game, however i think it could be improved massively by adding a multiplayer component."
12134,yis
12135,nice
12136,"This game pushes the limits of city builders/simulators. It's highly enjoyable, both for casual as well for advanced playing. And on top of the game and its DLCs, there's a huge amount of free mods (on PC only) which will improve gameplay even further.

The price/value of DLCs is controversial, and you might want to look/wait for sales.
But after getting all of them, I don't regret a single one. They all add nice gameplay elements which I wouldn't want to build without anymore.

It's main ""issue"" is its performance: C:S sacrifices quite some performance by being built on the Unity engine. If you download lots of custom assets, you'll quickly reach the limits of your PC. The game benefits the most from a good CPU, and eats up quite a lot of RAM.

Last but not least: The game runs very well on Linux, definitely smoother than on the other OS's."
12137,nice game to pass the time
12138,"Addictive City Builder game. Reminds me of the old Sim City games, but better. Massive amounts of mods to play with too, giving you even more stuff to micromanage traffic with. Hours of fun!"
12139,"Good
"
12140,"Cities Skylines doesn't recreate homelessness/vagrancy, unemployment, civil unrest, or other common yet unfortunate realities of city planning and urban living. But boy is it still fun. The map is your canvas. Districts, transit, traffic, and zoning are your paint. If this game doesnt get the creative side of your brain working, then I don't know what will."
12141,I love this game its really cool.
12142,"Can I recommend this game?......Well when this game first came out in 2015 I was a die hard cities xl player ,at first glance I thought it looked to bubble gummish for my liking but I purchased it anyway. since then I've grow to appreciate it as the best city builder game on the market so far.
 its not like a lot of the other so called city builders games of late that are basically the same game with different skins and minor game play aspects, and that fall flat in appearance. 
As you can see I've played CS quit a bit and purchased a few DLC's and Yes it can be a potato smoker (like mine) However the CS Steam workshop community  are a dedicated group  with a love of creating some of the most wonderful Mods and assets for a game that I have ever seen.
So can I recommend this game? ""Indubitably, Basil."""
12143,"sadly - you need a very good computer to run this. not good if you have a laptop. you cant even change any of the settings because of how slow it goes, so everything is forever stuck at the highest setting?? 
it sucks because i was very excited to play this game."
12144,"I am very sorry but in the beginning I didn't understand anything what I am supposed to do. The game explains two or three things and then lets you do whatever you want. That's good on the one hand, but for beginners I think this game is horrible on the other hand....sorry"
12145,Its really fun and you get to feel like you're a mayor (you basically are) It can kinda be educational since you may learn how to run a city and learn about financing. I highly recommend this game to people.
12146,cities skylines
12147,"IT is good
"
12148,this game is so fun
12149,cool
12150,hehe
12151,"This is such a great game and by far the best city builder I have ever encountered.

While making good use of the Workshop with all its great Mods and Assets, this game will never get old."
12152,good game
12153,There isn't anything new to say here. This is the best city building game out there. This is the next evolution of Sim City with a ton of DLC from the developers and a massive modding community. It also runs in 4K on a decent PC. Fantastic.
12154,nice
12155,Lots of customization options
12156,whoawhoawhoa good game
12157,"I spent 3 hours perfecting a town, only to place a water tower on polluted soil at hour 3. Shortly there after my town experienced a plague and everyone died, and I didn't have a save to revert to.

100/10 great game"
12158,i play game too much play too much bad
12159,uy
12160,perfect.
12161,Yeah it's pretty fun
12162,"Best city builder on the market, miles clear of SimCity.  Traffic is still an issue however, as vehicles are dumbasses and only use one lane."
12163,"Great game! Absolutely love it! I just wish it wasn't SO CPU heavy. It is bad.

Getting past 5k population it drops to 20 FPS on a good day. That's at medium settings.

It's been 6 years. Time to release a more optimized version/game that doesn't rely so heavily on CPU."
12164,its fun
12165,GET THIS GAME!!
12166,Amazing City building with a lot of mods and assets available!
12167,ye
12168,This game is fun cause you can build and download the building i would give it a 9/10 good game!
12169,"If your Looking for a City Building game where you can Express your Creativity, This is the game for you.

This game has all the possibilities when it comes to expressing your engineering and architecture. You can build cities where the buildings touch the sky, or even make a suburban state full of small houses and great education. Ive played this game since about 2020, I started with the Windows 10 edition and purchased the Steam edition earlier this year when i found out how much better it is.

Steam workshop makes playing this game so much easier! Mods like Move it, Road Anarchy, Node Controller and many more make this game #1. Assets and maps make this game so fun! The Vanilla maps and assets are Great, But seeing what others have made and using it yourself is 100% better.

You know that one game that feels like you played for 4 seconds but in reality you played all day? That pretty much the summary of this game. You start with a little town, 3 minutes later its a HUGE city.

This game is my favorite City Building game WAYYYY over Sim City. I recommend this to ANYONE who enjoys these types of games."
12170,COOL
12171,great
12172,very creative and fun to play
12173,good game
12174,"the cities in this game are the equivlelent of the number 84, yoyu see, t he tme for resitrusctuion, is also not. but this game"
12175,Fun city builder and great time sink.
12176,The city must grow
12177,Made me get turned on by sexy road layouts and good traffic
12178,Very well designed game that challenges your city building skills. There is a slight learning curve with the dlc packs and learning how to actually build your city but it is quite fulfilling especially if your interested in architecture/ engineering.
12179,This is a great game. Way better than Simcity.
12180,I love this game. The modding community in this game is great.
12181,"Cities Skylines is a fun city building simulator.  There isn't much ""game"" to it other than don't run out of money and you can chase achievements to unlock more monuments."
12182,nice
12183,"Great Game. Much like the other reviews said, the modding community has kept this game alive and honestly are the only thing that makes the game truly playable. Once you start using advanced road placing tools and decorating tools, you remove basically any limitations. Its the game we all wanted Simcity to be. Buy it."
12184,"This is a really awesome game. I was always into Sim City, but this game is a whole other level and if you like details, and I mean details of working, building and operating a city then this is the game for you."
12185,CAN PLAY FOR HOURS!
12186,city
12187,:)
12188,very nice game
12189,"epic game, besides only fun for a bit, without DLC's"
12190,Great game! The DLCs are great too!
12191,I really like the world building of this game and figuring out optimal traffic routes and maximizing income and happiness. It has a lot to balance but I enjoy that.

12193,"It's an amazing city building game, it is a Paradox game so DLC is kind of required to make it the best game it can be. The base isn't bad per say, but the DLC adds so many useful features that make the game top tier."
12194,very fun!
12195,"I don't know if i'm the only one or if others also have this, but every time i start the game i get a ""The game crashed. The crash report folder named ""2021-13-30_163156"" next to game executable. It would be great if you send it to the developer of the game!""
Well, this is me telling you that i have this problem. 
I don't know if this changes anything, but i got the game as a present."
12196,Its a great - specially with mods
12197,I have never built a successful city
12198,Fun
12199,"This game has become one of my favorite games to pass the time. The wealth of content in the base game, the tons of mods and workshop items you can get, plus the community is amazing, I absolutely recommend this game if this genre is something you like."
12200,One of the best games I’ve ever played.
12201,good
12202,very good
12203,GREAT
12204,"EPIC GAme, however, it can be hard to start out when you are new to the game."
12205,This game is a lot better with mods. Super easy to install with the workshop and they make an okay game into the best city builder I've played so far. I'm not a fan of so much paid DLC but I only got mass transit and some other one and it never felt like I needed the rest.
12206,"Dez City
"
12207,this game very fun and relax
12208,Great strategy game if you like building cities and like challanges
12209,"OMG, another addon I NEED to buy... This game has been hook line and sinker and I have been playing since day 2. lol"
12210,It's amazing and you can create fantastic cities and encouter realistic problems.
12211,Bosan? Try skali
12212,"There's a bit of a learning curve to playing this on a mac - google search is definitely needed to get started and for some fairly basic shortcuts and functionality.  But once you get the hang of it, this is loads of fun, and highly addictive."
12213,"Hi
My PC is slow for loading this game sometimes iss ok but  mostly not ok



"
12214,"Its alright, but really feels like it requires DLC or Mods to actually have things work well."
12215,
12216,"Great Simulator, becomes much more fun with Mods"
12217,"The best city building experience there is. Nothing tops this game, I first played this because I saw it on xbox gamepass for pc and I had heard good things about it so I downloaded it to try it. After quickly gripping the basics of the game I became addicted. I loved the experience on the xbox platform for pc but I looked at some content creators and kept wondering why they had more features than I did on the gamepass version. Mods and dlcs. So naturally I went over to g2a.com and got myself the game for steam and a bunch of dlcs for a very cheap price, way better than on steam, and never looked back. The experience is much better on steam and since I have poured my hours into crafting beautiful cities. I played the old SimCity's when I was little and even spent quite a bit of time on SimCity 2013 despite its shortcomings, but this game just takes all the negatives of that game and improves in just about every way. There is no game like Cities: Skylines, it is the best city building game ever."
12218,Fuck tsunamis fr they killed my little town
12219,simcity but better in everyway
12220,"top class, clear of sims"
12221,"This game is for a very specific type of person that used to play Sim City before EA games ruined it. When you know, you know. Worth every cent."
12222,"Yes, please come vist ""Cock sucker city"" anytime"
12223,fun
12224,really fun
12225,"Great game, wish they had some VR options"
12226,Good
12227,god i love urban planning
12228,"I absolutely love this game! I used to play SimCity growing up and so a friend of mine just recently turned me on to Cities. It's super rewarding to put time and effort into your city and watch it grow from the ground up. Plus there's a ton of customization. For example, I really enjoy being able to change the stop signs/traffic lights at intersections and just fully control the flow of traffic. It's super easy to get lost in this game and end up putting in hours when you thought you were only putting in minutes...lol. If you enjoy city planning games, I'd highly recommend this one!"
12229,"If you have a happy life and want to ruin it by being angered by stupid game mechanics, then this game is for you. Easily one of the worst city builders i've ever played"
12230,yes
12231,Really fun city management game.
12232,i think i got the wrong version of sims city
12233,"I PLACED A ROUNDABOUT.
WHY.
THE [b] FUCK. [/b]
IS IT [i] STILL [/i] AT 99%."
12234,incredibly complicated at first glance but super creative and fun when you get the idea.
12235,"My time has disappeared, my wife left me, she took the kids, but these idiots won't stop changing lanes so I need to continue engineering"
12236,"If you are not put off by the price of buying all the pieces to this thing (which, mind you, is a downer and perhaps deal-breaker for some), this appears to be everything your favorite city simulator was meant to be.   I'm about 12 hours in and I know that I have only scratched the surface for all of the features, tweaks, opportunities, and options, but I think this is a keeper."
12237,"it's simcity with out maxis / EA, B.S."
12238,probably my favorite sim. personally i enjoy vanilla play style but there is something out there for everyone in this
12239,"So good in so many ways, best city sim."
12240,"Excellent fun, but beware, if you can afford them, you will end up buying the DLC. Also, some mods make the experience far more enjoyable and replayable, and are all freely available. Recommended for everyone looking to spend a long afternoon of over-thought entertainment."
12241,Great Game
12242,"it's a game for nerds, but it's a cool game for nerds
"
12243,hell
12244,"This game is only enjoyable with mods and hundreds of assets.  The vanilla buildings in this game are awkward and stupid looking, billboards and advertisements completely ruin the aesthetic of any commercial building.  Vanilla vehicle AI is pathetic and the cars look stupid"
12245,"Spend hours trying new planning strategies, meme-city builds, modding, abandoning and starting over to eventually realize you are still not as good as Biffa. Seriously though, I have thoroughly enjoyed returning to this game a few times every year to try something new. 

This game is my old man train set in the basement of my house."
12246,game.
12247,"This game will suck you in, while it's already fun and addicting to play the base game, with mods, assets, and DLCS it becomes a whole new game. 

Not much in the way of difficulty, but that's okay as its still fun and rewarding to just keep expanding your city.

The community here is good.
Workshop is definitely worth taking a look, you can make this game look 10x better, almost like real life.

DLC can range anywhere from, alright to complete game changer.

Very addicting. 10/10"
12248,"I used to play this game on the pirated version. I've spent hours, days, months, years playing this game and I still love it until today. Yes, this game's DLCs are ridiculously expensive but at least this game has tons of assets and mods to play with. 

10/10, I do recommend this game."
12249,If you are look for a tycoon+simulation this is the perfect game.
12250,If you want a City Building game then this is the game you get. Simple.
12251,"Best game I've played in a very long time.
Thanks for the Linux support!"
12252,Poopoo pants
12253,it is fun
12254,Fun game. Creativity barf
12255,is fun
12256,its kinda cool with the themes and the disaster dlc.
12257,it is a good game with very fun otions
12258,"Its not bad, just a bit dated now."
12259,this game has made me get a legal prescription of Prozac
12260,good
12261,One of the best games I have ever played. There are so much mods and the creativity is endless.
12262,"Definitely a time sync, but the sandbox capabilities and game play have made this title a staple in my library."

12265,"its a very great game and eceded all my expectations. even though there are dlcs, paradox still adds components from the dlcs into the base game, which is great if your not sure if you should get it. i personally like it better than sim city, as theres more that you can do. also the workshop mods and map make it even better
"
12266,Good
12267,"It ain't SimCity. It ain't SimCity (2013) either, which is to say, Cities: Skylines works, for the most part.
I can't suggest a better city builder at this point, many years after having preordered.  And we're still getting new content.  Hm."
12268,it is really nice game you need to try it
12269,"  While there is certainly a lack of tutorials and guides in-game, the experience of slowly discovering ways to expand and improve your city is extremely addicting and one of a kind. Also the dlc expansions really add to the fun of the base game. Highly recommended for fans of the genre."
12270,"like pretty much everything, mars radio is the bomb, except a few songs they added that have actual people tryna sing but the commercials are what I like, lol. I prefer ps4 controls, tons of hours on ps4 got it for steam to mess around with from time to time."
12271,Best city building game ever !
12272,"Very satisfying city builder.
Lots of mods are available on the steam workshop;  you can expand your building blocks catalogue, find new maps, change graphics, update AI, etc.
100% can Recommend"
12273,"The most hideous game I have ever laid eyes on, or tried to. I don't mean in graphical assets, I mean in developer incompetence. 

In 5 minutes of play it will quite literally give you cataracts in both your eyes. 

If you do want to have a try, first smear some vasoline on your eyeballs so that the anti aliasing will improve, along with the benefit of countering the vasoline smear that the developers have already introduced all over the interface. When you are finally able to see anything going on through the smudge, enjoy roads and trees popping in and out of existence based on the angle you view them or zoom level. 

In my experience it is the most disgusting visuals in a game I have ever seen. Maybe I was sold a dud because nobody mentions any of this and will defend this abomination until you really book a trip to the doctor thinking your eyesight is the problem.

// MODS fix your game, I have recommended all the mods I use to fix the visuals instead of the actual game, still cannot recommend it, but if you are willing to find the right mods then it is a good game."
12274,"awesome game, hard to get a hang of it at first, but once you watch a few youtube tutorials and play by yourself, it's very fun"
12275,a
12276,"Although it is made by a different developer from the famously known city builder simulation game —‘Sims City’, Cities Skyline fixed what is wrong with Sims City and improve it with new and fascinating features."

12288,good game
12289,Great city building game
12290,Love it
12291,A City Builder game worth your time
12292,"Dont launch properly on mac, countless threads about this issue in their technical forum"
12293,gg
12294,
12295,
12296,"Very in depth game, can lose many hours into this game"
12297," Time flies by while playing this game! Sometimes I feel that it gets a bit boring as after about an hour of playing I have about 10k citizens. The real fun is found in the mods. The ""walk'n'drive"" mod is great fun however bridges do not work. It is a great game that I would recommend for people of all ages."
12298,"I would really love to recommend this game although, I just can't. I've played this game since 2016 and I would say it is very fun for the first 100 hours. But after that the limited amount of stuff in the base game forces you to buy the dlcs. Each dlc costs 10-15 bucks so multiply that by fully updated game with all the major dlcs it costs 90-135 dollars on top of the base game which is 30 dollars. So in total you are paying 120-165 dollars for the full edition of a city building game. Is it worth it? No. This is what I hate about paradox and their greedy tendencies to lock essential features behind paywalls. It is absolutely sickening to see such a beautiful game being mutilated into bite sized pieces."
12299,good
12300,It's very addicting and super fun to play.
12301,"this game is a great sandbox game
"
12302,game good
12303,hot
12304,addictive
12305,"Kind of fun, but it euro as fuck. You can tell it was made by european leftists. Certainly better than all the sim city games."
12306,AHHHHHHHHHH
12307,"step 1: make new city
step 2: build city
step 3: grow city
step 4: to much traffic due to bad city start
step 5: city collapse due to traffic
step 6: go back to step 1"
12308,Cities: Skylines takes over where SimCity left off. If you are a fan of City Building then this is your game.
12309,very fun and entertaining game if if you like simulations
12310,Doesn't work on Linux as advertised. Gets to 75% loaded and then crashes my computer.
12311,very cool.
12312,I have never played a game so badly optimised. I can play Red Dead Redemption 2 on the highest settings but can barely run this garbage. Apparently this game only uses 1 core of your CPU? Talk about incompetent developers...
12313,волк
12314,Extremely addicting especially once you start subscribing to mods and other stuff. I wish it uses the full power of my GPU without mods and the annoying random stuttering and dropouts fixed
12315,"Great game. FFF = fail, forward, fast. Be brave enough to learn from making mistakes, look for the good, and you will enjoy this game."
12316,amazing
12317,fun
12318,"Runs smoothly
"
12319,"Cities is a great game, but I simply cannot justify being positive about a game that sells you essential features. My game time on Steam is so low because all my DLC is on PS4 and you don't realize how limiting the game is until you've played with more. 

Basically imagine you get an early access title and they sell you the rest of the completed game. That's what Cities is. It's a whole hell of a lot of fun, sold to you for an extra 12.99-14.99 at a time. Oh. Not every upgrade is in one DLC. You need multiple to make a fully functioning and fun game with options."
12320,I like the in-game features and the free downloadable additional content; this game has several awesome attributes over its biggest competitor.
12321,"it good

12324,Fun
12325,fun

12327,The best game ever?
12328,In my opinion the best city building sim out there.
12329,"After 250 hours all my assets from steam workshop have been loaded
Nice game"
12330,pretty cool
12331,"Yes it's amazing, unlimited opportunities, though very limited industrial things and electricity."
12332,fun game.
12333,it keeps crashing
12334,"Great City Builder, but awful DLC prices. Its like $200 if you want to get everything..."
12335,"fun when bord or stressed, easy and made me want to get more achements."
12336,"Really fun game especially with mods! You need a good pc if you want big cities
"
12337,"I have played this on multi xbox consoles and of course pc.  I prefer the pc due to ease of mouse and key board, Before you say it, I know that I can hook a keyboard and mouse to my xbox. I also prefer the mods and assets available on pc."
12338,"This game is an amazing city builder. 
So good in fact that It smothered sim city in its hospital bed to become the de facto best city builder on steam, that i'm aware of. But high praise aside it is still a game from 2015, I'd like to see evidence of them working on a new instalment on a slightly more advanced engine. Or how about they make a period peace version of cities skyline, i'd love for paradox to make a spiritual successor to Caesar or Pharaoh, maybe build some 1400th century fiefs. 

just something new, not DLC. that being side judging by the state of Jurassic work evolution 2 maybe that's not a good idea."
12339,best sim ever
12340,Satisfying
12341,fererer
12342,"Fun.  Sometimes tricky to learn.  Wish there was a mode to just build and test things like just roads.  Or trains.  Or industry.  And everything else was taken care of.  Kind of like the sims automatically build houses, buildings, etc. once things are zoned properly.  It would be nice to just pay attention to the things you're interested in at the time.  But I guess that kind of defeats the whole point of the game..."
12343,only fun if you are good at money managment

12345,"My playtime percentage:
6% looking for mods
30% stuck on loading screen hoping the game wont crash because i have 100 mods and 3000 assets downloaded forcing my pc that cant even handle that much
10% thinking of a good layout
15% trying to fix traffic
5% watching the city slowly getting destroyed and die
4% waiting game to stop lagging
30% normal gameplay

10/10 would recommend to waste your time"
12346,"This is a better version of SimCity.  The gameplay and graphics are better, though the issue of having to junt around for finite resources to keep the supply chains going is a bit annoying, as you can't simply 'buy' resources from outside and it's a bit false and a sidetrack from an otherwise outstanding experience.  Would recommend."
12347,i recommend
12348,gud
12349,Really fun
12350,Very goodddddddddddddddd
12351,Its great! i love it!
12352,"As a kid I've always been amazed by architecture, cities and massive concrete jungles such as Manhattan or central Tokyo. At this age I did not have access to any consoles and an Ipad was all I had. I found sim city on the app store which gave me something to chew on for quite a bit however sim city felt very automated or to be more specific, it felt like I was being restricted and I couldn't let my imagination run free and the game was holding my hand throughout the process. I didn't have much options with road design other than straight roads that made my city look like random grids and once your city gets big enough, it starts to look very generic and the same as any other average player's city. The only sense of personality found in a city is from unique buildings you have to pay a fortune for to be able to own. Eventually Sim city was a memory in the past.

 I moved on to Minecraft when I got a PS4 when I was 12 and tried to fulfil my dream of building my own massive city. The journey was great and Minecraft did let my imagination run wild but having to place every single little block bit by bit gets tiring and it soon takes up a lot of your time until you're burnt out after only building basic things for a city. So I gave up. 

 One day it was a boring weekend and I was bored out my brain. On playstation now, a free trial was staring me in the face. It shun in my face, the bright advertisement enticing me.I yanked my card out of my wallet and said to myself ""this should be fun"". After the transaction was made I started scrolling through a selection of games. Suddenly one caught my eye. ""Cities : Skylines"". It smiled at me and made me feel a burning sensation in my heart, but a soft burn that satisfied me and flushed in a river of nostalgia through my brain. Being 14 at the time, it had been 2 years since I practically gave up on my city building dreams and I was just a lousy teen playing the same typical games every other 14 year old was playing. I told myself ""maybe I can do what younger me would've wanted, I'm not that interested in cities and stuff anymore but this should be fun even if its just for half an hour, lets give it a shot"". I watched the trailer for the game, and before it even finished I was blown away and raced to install the game. After it installed, I had a joyride letting my imagination run freeer than free. Then came the 2020 lockdown a few months later and the amount of time I spent on this game daily was unhealthy. Even with numerous restrictions on the console version of this game, I still felt like a slave whose chains had been taken off, like a burden had been lifted off my back with grace and I was free. I fell in love. 

Fast forward a bit into the future, I made the switch to the PC master race. Almost all my friends who switched did so to play a game competitively be it Fortnite, Rainbow Six Siege or Call of Duty, but me, I wanted what the PC Master race boasted most, Freedom. As I was scrolling through steam looking what games to kick off my PC gaming experience I remembered cities skylines. A distant memory in my head. It was calling for my love and I was calling for its gifts. I installed it once again. It sat on my computer neglected for months before I finally found time to open it and see what was up.
I was even more blown away. The freedom this game brings on PC, the customisation, the mods, the LUTS ,the numerous things you can do to make your city unique to you, its all just so fabulous.

That leaves me to bring us to the present. I don't have much hours on this game, but all I can say is its 100% worth it. On sale or full price, it doesn't matter. BLOODY MASTERPIECE! Every now and then you need a game that you can just sit with, turn off from the typical online multiplayer and have some me time. Get a cup of tea, sit back, download all the mods your heart desires, and build the biggest and best city you want to build however you like with almost 0 limitations. This game without mods is already fantastic, but the vast mod market bring a whole new experience that makes this game almost untouchable. The devs have outdone themselves making such a brilliant game with so much detail and love for such a little price. If I had to give a rating honeslty 9.6/10. If you've read to this last bit and read my whole story, this game finally fulfilled what 7 year old me always dreamed of, a game where I can let my little heart build whatever it wants and where the only limit is my imagination. 

A few negatives that I must mention, if you plan on playing vanilla (no mods) on some maps, the lighting and the way the game looks can kind of throw you off or might not make your city look as good. Cities Skylines is remarkable but lighting is sometimes a huge problem whether its an unrealistic look or overly bright to the point where your carefully planned city looks like a dump simply because of how the lighting makes your buildings look. Aside from that, 100% recommend."
12353,Amazing Game!
12354,"IDK if its the nostalgia boner, but god I love this game"
12355,good
12356,"I downloaded the game and created my account on the launcher, i agreed to the terms and conditions then it crashed. When ever i tried to start it up it would just say failed to start launcher, i verified integrity and re-downloaded the game but didn't work."
12357,"Sit back and relax or the other way around...
I like it"
12358,"I really like the house models. The game is amazing , recommend buying it!
"
12359,I have played on my brother computer and loved it so I am slowly getting all the DLC and a few mods to get my best city again
12360," In my Top 5 games of all time. A game that you can either be 100% focused on and love it, or, let it run on another screen and do other things. Sometimes, when I'm feeling frisky, I'll start the game, get my income to around $1000+ dollars, (maybe ~$500-1000 population), build a bunch of landfills, set the game to triple speed, go to sleep/work, come back, and demolish everything. Then, start with a bunch of money with all achievements still available."
12361,"Fun game, but can be buggy."
12362,This game should be rewarded as the most 'addicting and satisfying game' in gaming. When will I ever stop playing this? This is such a fun game!
12363,Its a cool game with mods and you can mess around with the natural disasters
12364,"It's a game I come back to again and again and can spend hours building districts or solving traffic problems.  Very enjoyable.  One of my favorite management games and might be the one I have the most time invested into.  Early game, money management is the name of the game.  Mid-game, it's growth and balanced, happy areas to maximize taxes.  Later in the game, it's more traffic management and thoughtful growth.

Typical of paradox games, it has a lot of DLC.  Some of it is worthwhile, when on sale.  I love this game and the Crusader Kings series."
12365,hehehe
12366,I rate it.
12367,Great game but i think most people know that by now
12368,fun
12369,good
12370,"Thats a good game
"
12371,Yeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee
12372,The item/object snapping is the real only problem I have and its only a minor annoyance
12373,"Not much to say runs good, Looks good, Is good as in fun. One thing I hate is the way the power lines work putting them in places where clearly the power line is over a house or road perfectly but still doesn't let me place it or makes me break the building and I know theres mods for that but still I shouldn't have to have mods for that it just feels like it should be like that already or atleast have a setting for that. I also Like how the game encourages Moding unlike other games, I do however see why other games wouldn't encourage it. Its very nice that the game devs are letting the community in on things even to the point of adding a mods area on the menu where you can go to steam workshop and look for mods. I got the game on sale cause it was a good deal and I didn't know much going in so I didn't wanna spend alot of money when I don't even know if its good or if I'll like it but I can say if your into City Sim games or even Building for that matter this is perfect and is realistic and complex instead of being like: Oh you can build a city! everyone lives No bad guys No pollution No power or water needed or No Sewers. Would Have bought this game even if it was 30$ And I'm probably going to get the DLC soon."
12374,get it
12375,This game is like crack!
12376,Its a porn game. Very addictive
12377,"If you like realistic simulations, this is about as close as you can come. I love how much is included in this game when it comes to city planning. It even has little stuff that most wouldn't think about when it comes to city planning."
12378,"I like it, but it's too advanced for my hamster brain. :("
12379,fun
12380,"this is a great city builder , pretty much the best ever since it released"
12381,"This game is the flag bearer for city building games. With immense detail, fun game-play and well pace achievements it has it all. 

I'm a few expansions behind but will definitely pick them up at some stage!

I'd love a 'streets of Simcity' style expansion / VR experience in addition!"

12385,dundee
12386,'
12387,"It's like Simcity, only much, much better. It also allows mods too!"
12388,it is the most fun game i have ever played!
12389,One of my favorite games!
12390,"Over built the foundations to city, spammed homes, shops and industry, placed too many coal power and water pumps sucking up the waste water and now my city is dying left and right. 10/10"
12391,"good game

management-style gameplay is good for people who aren't super familiar with the genre (me)

laying out and building your city is neat, but a lot of the features after a few hours of playing start to become confusing if you want to sustain your citizens.

super fun, use guides - 8/10"
12392,"Even years after this game has been released, this is BY FAR the best city simulation game.  It is fun, colorful, and comes with a great community.  My only gripe is that the base game is definitely lacking traffic management tools, but mods are easy to install and work to improve this game flawlessly.  I have spent over 200 hours on this game so far and I don't regret it at all."
12393,The best way to spend 23 out of 24 hours of your day.....day after day!
12394,I've been playing city based sims since the first version on Sim City. This one is worth owning if you like such games.
12395,"fun when you make a poop mouton... and when you play like a ""normal"" person."
12396,Great game to relax and just build
12397,good game
12398,Very fun go boom boom
12399,as an old simcity 4 fan.......playing cities skyline is exceptional....in graphics and gameplay alike.....I am hooked on this city builder...and have only just had started playing it.I see hundreds of enjoyable game play ahead
12400,"i love the limitless opportunities that can be accomplished along with the creativity and imagination needed for this game. The base game is playable but can be improved which is resolved with the Steam Workshop. Along with realistic graphics, any urban/suburban design is possible."
12401,"I would absolutely recommend Cities: Skylines for anybody. I can play this game for hours on end, it never gets old. It also does require some thinking when it comes to planning your city. I typically struggle with traffic and end up doing something stupid like upgrading the exit ramps into six lane one-way roads. It is well-worth my time (and money) and if your are thinking of buying this game, go for it."
12402,this game is pretty fun... bit over a learning curve
12403,"fun, build city's destroy them with meteors. most fun I have had in a while."
12404,nice game... simple
12405,"This game is excellent! it encourages use of your imagination to design a city, and research skills when learning about city planning.  There are many mods and assets that you can choose from; you also have the opportunity to develop your own mods, assets and maps to build your city.  Highly recommended!"
12406,"This game is amazing, I love the idea of a city planning game and Its great and all but the only thing i dislike is how sometimes there are sometimes gliches in the street lights with an ennoying white cone shape."
12407,Amazing relaxing fun.
12408,"I really liked almost everything about this game,"
12409,I LIKE THIS GAME BUT NEED MORE GUIDE IN BGIGINERS thank you for this game devleper
12410,Don't bother wasting your time. Crashes out at 20k - 50k population with more than the recommended in hardware specs on latest macbook pro pre m1 and on m1. Pointless gaming purchase and the only game you can't play and get your moneys worth.
12411,A very fun game of city simulation.
12412,gives me something to do
12413,"Great game, works better with the mods."
12414,build city!!!!!
12415,straight bussin'
12416,Love this game.!
12417,hours and hours of entertainment...
12418,"There is a lot to like about Cities: Skylines, but it doesn't come without its shortcomings. I've been playing city building games since Sim City 4 and for the past several years have built with Cities: Skylines Xbox One Edition. Inspired by some of the great builds by creators on YouTube, and disappointed with the limitations of the console version, I dove in to take advantage of the mods available with my recent gaming laptop purchase. Still just getting acquainted with this more open platform, a little overwhelmed by all that is available, I am looking forward to experiencing a new level of building. My hope is that one day a new version of Cities: Skylines will be released with many of what I consider to be obligatory mod capabilities and features built into it while still leaving room for developers to add customization capabilities."
12419,Nice 69
12420,"Excellent game, I started playing at midnight and just realized it is quarter past 6. I should sleep. 10/10 would recommend"
12421,Love it!!
12422,kox
12423,nothing brings me more joy than creating a class divide in this game
12424,fun
12425,"The game will be whatever you'll want it to be. It could be hobbie  it could be freetime game. 

9/10"
12426,Really good building game 10/10 buy it.
12427,I really like all of the DLC's that you can buy with the game. they all add so much to the gameplay and really enhance many of this games great aspects. You could play this game for hours and not get bored - great for a lazy afternoon ;)
12428,great city sim
12429,i got just one word for this game amazing.
12430,its great its lit
12431,great
12432,amazing game - most played game on my steam library. Also the game I have revisited the most. Built in mods make the game that much better. cannot recommend enough!
12433,good
12434,"I really like how it does contains some ideas from SimCity, but overall it is a major improvement."
12435,very cool
12436,Do you think rockstar freddy was gregnant
12437,JUST NOICE!
12438,Mods are needed for basic functionality and the game itself has become slightly unstable with road placement after playing for a while. Keeps saying I cant build roads in certain places because theres something in the way even when there isnt. Sad to see a game I liked become unplayable without janky work arounds
12439,Best city game yet. Cant wait for the updated version
12440,"i played 8 hours in a single night, god help me"
12441,nice bich
12442,One of the cleanest city sims in existence. Mod support is excellent and post-release support from Paradox has been great too.
12443,Fun
12444,"The absolute best city building simulator. It even simulates the real world work force. Thousands of people and plenty of access to education, but they choose to not get educated or go work in the industry locations!"
12445,awesome game
12446,Amazing game.
12447,"Yeah, good."
12448,"fun
"
12449,"This is my style of game, and loved it since i first got sim city, so with that i'm a bit biased for games like this... With that, this is the best one I have played to date, with all the add-ons and mods, you can build the best city ever!"
12450,it good
12451,awesome gameeererefafgadgadfgsdfgsdgafewrfargf
12452,"Absolutely masterpiece of simulators world, hands down
 There's so much city management options, that it's simply overwhelming. 12/10
Been playing on pirate for some time and now it's time for me to say ""thank you"" to development team. Yes, the price is controversial, but you can ignore every radio DLC and get it on a big discount, that occurs often"
12453,"i relly like this game 
the mods are free 
affordable
cool cities
"
12454,good game just remeber to obey your subjects or else they rip you to shreds lmao
12455,Good game 4/5 stars
12456,yep
12457,verygood
12458,very good game. mods reccomended
12459,I had a great time with this app
12460,"I first found this game through a youtuber and decided to get the game. At first, I found it kind of fun but once I played it more, city planning became something  I got  interested in. To be honest, anyone who likes city planning or even doesn't know a thing about it but is trying to find a hobby, this game is perfect for you. I have bought almost every DLC and I think they are all very good. A critique I have about this game is it can be quite laggy though This can be fixed with mods and also just lowering settings. If that doesn't work, sometimes you can just restart the game."
12461,yes
12462,"It's pretty good. It improved what was cool about Sim City 2000 (yeah that was the last simulation city game I played), but yeah, very detailed, and it's pretty relaxing to just design different layouts for the cities. 

you're the mayor of this town/city you build and you gotta keep your citizens happy, and keep up with water, sewage, trash, crime, electricity, etc., tons of stuff to manage to make you feel like a mayor

I had a good city going, until I screwed up the hydroelectric dam I was building and I flooded it. Good times...so I'll likely start over and build a new one. You can use infinite money and limitless land, just enable them at the main menu

I'm probably going to see if I can build a ""concentric circle"" type city and see how it performs. What it would essentially be like, is essential services in the center (police, fire, hospitals), then the next concentric circle has education, then housing, and then urban zoning further out...that way everyone is as close as can be to everything they need.

It's fun to start off with nothing and then have it slowly grow. 

Plenty of mods for the game as well."
12463,blah blah blah
12464,"It is a fun game, the hardest part of the game is learning how to start a new map but once you get through the early stages it is fun to play."
12465,made an eco friendly city outside of a poop lagoon
12466,"great game for relaxing and getting creative. best with mods. I've come a long way from just slapping streets and zones down to highly detailed parking lots and shopping centers with every bush and building hand placed in it's perfect spot.

the simulation isnt always perfect when it comes to the traffic but you can learn how to manage it's quirks it's still fun to watch. I just love big highways and intricate road systems and this game + mods provides a vast array of tools so you can fine tune your roads exactly how you want."
12467,Nice.
12468,i flooded a town with sewage
12469,VERY

12474,Really chill game. It can be as simple or as complex as you want it to be. The controls are amazing and pretty intuitive as well.
12475,Been playing this game Off & On for years. This game IS what Sim City wishes it could be. No complaints on this game. Looking forward to the Next Gen version of this game.
12476,"Great city building game 10/10

12477,A very immersive city management simulator game to test your ability to create and maintain your own cities with unlimited possibilities now due to new DLC and mods for the game.

"
12492,"sleek, visually pleasing and close to real world game. Especially loved its hydraulic power feature and how it impacts river flows. Traffic control systems and road building tools are cool. Game distinguishes itself from other benchmark games like SimCity through above features and poses some unique challenges to builder.

On downside, game's city financial management is very easy and doesn't pose much challenge to gamers the aspect which was very well used in other games. Also having airports in city would have definitely helped (yet to try out new airport expansion)... 

All on all great game and must-try for city builders and planners :)"
12493,If your nostalgic for SimCity get it. Its a fun game.
12494,uiuiuiui
12495,its great.
12496,.
12497,amazing game once you work out how to play like Biffa
12498,"If you have a lot of time on your hands, play C: S today! Unlock different types of roads, help citizens out with water, sewage filtering and electricity, DLC's also give extra feel to the game. For example, Cities: Skylines - Airports is coming out soon and I find it to look very interesting! Build up your reputation as a mayor today on Cities: Skylines now!"
12499,It is good
12500,"good game, refunded because of performance issues."
12501,cool with multiplayer :)
12502,Yes
12503,"I originally got into this game because a good friend of mine that is a civil engineer is very into it. Even as someone very removed from that field, I feel that this game is a great experience for someone to relax and accomplish a few tasks over a couple of hours. This game is a lot more complex than it originally looked before I purchased it. I highly recommend this game for anyone that enjoys city builders, or even anyone that enjoys making complex solutions to on-going problems."
12504,"What can I say; the king of city builders. Incredibly deep gameplay even as vanilla; wildly powerful with mods. You really can't go wrong if you're into this type of thing. It's not perfect, and the graphics have definitely aged, but not too poorly. Really not too much to say other than it's a solid game all around that will suck you in for dozens, if not hundreds of hours. Definitely worth full price, but even better if you can pick it up on sale with a few expansion packs. Would recommend."
12505,"this game is pretty chilling and relaxing
i play this game in my free time
u can do anything in here, from making ur own dream city to volcano full of ""bad water""
"
12506,yangman
12507,"Highly recommend getting this if you are a newbie like me and don't want To do the quest like me for the monuments.
The +5 new buildings really help for any quest there is such as The medical center monument."
12508,"Linux note: Using Proton 6.3-8 patch with the Paradox launcher but why does there need to be a launcher when there is not one on the PS4, Xbox, and Windows version which I have used?

I finally retired from playing SimCity 3000 Unlimited since that game launched and I wasn't that big of a fan of SimCity 4 or the SimCity reboot that led to the closure of Maxis Game by evil Electronic Arts.  When you use a game like that for 20+ years, it's fair to expect the replacement game to really surpass the game it's replacing and Skylines does that without breaking a sweat.  The detail of Skylines is just astounding compared to those SimCity games of the past.

I know I'm late to the party but I hope Paradox supports this game for years to come even if there is talk of Skylines 2."
12509,"Pretty sick
"
12510,"This is the best city building game that  I have played since sim city, and this is way better."
12511,"If you are interested in city builder simulations, managing city policies and public works, this is the game for you."
12512,"Hugely complicated, ridiculously opaque, deeply engaging, terribly addicting. 

Get ready to google a LOT of stuff to play this game. It lacks any kind of meaningful tutorial, never explains its underlying systems, and is occasionally completely enraging. But once you get it, it gets its hooks into you and won't let go."
12513,This game is very fun but difficult but not too difficult that its not fun this is one of my favorite games.
12514,LOVE IT!!!
12515,"a good game
"
12516,"Are you...
Patient?
Creative?
Easily addicted to challenges?
A problem solver?
A fan of the city building genre?

Answered yes to all of the above? Then this is a game for you. It's the best city building game ever created.

I was a fan of SimCity from 1990 until it self-imploded several years ago. Played CitiesXL but it was painfully glitchy. Cities Skylines is everything those games wanted to be and so much more. And, you can play offline when you want.

This game will test you... in a very good way. You're the Commander-in-chief and your city can grow and thrive, yet it can also fail miserably if you expect fast results. It's by no means an easy game; patience and a willingness to learn/understand the dynamics make it a fun and challenging experience. Traffic will torture you if you don't plan properly; I'm not a professional city planner but I've created several successful cities that have free flowing traffic (and.... I don't use mods). Start with the base game as it has more than enough options to lay out your unique city and gives you a lot to manage.

Sales happen a few times a year so need to buy DLCs until you get the hang of the base game.

Don't go crazy with Steam workshop mods unless you're sure your computer has enough RAM and processing power.

Been playing for over 2 years and have no regrets with my purchase :)
Time well spent!!"
12517,good
12518,The progression is very manageable. You learn very quickly this way
12519,"It's more a ""Fix-the-horrendous-traffic-simulator"" than anything else"
12520,i dont know what the fuck to do 95% of the time but i have so much fun
12521,very fun game if you are into tycoon type games
12522,its really good
12523,I will start off by saying if you like sim city 4 or other city builder games you will more than likely like this game as well. The DLC packages are worth the Money. The Mods that you can get for this game make it so detailed and so customizable you can find just about anything you want. I would say on a 1 - 10 scale. 1 being horrible and 10 being incredible. I would give this a solid 9.5 Well worth the money even at full price!
12524,rip simcity
12525,"pretty cool so far
"
12526,Quite good
12527,"Good game, after a playthrough or two you need mods to spice things up"

12534,its ight
12535,Beautiful game.
12536,"This game is super versatile, and with every game play you'll have a different outcome each time. It's got a pretty difficult learning curve, and you'll always be learning new ways to play and do things better, but that's what makes the game fun. Once you get a hang of it and can keep your head above water, then that's where the fun begins. I'm learning a lot by watching Youtubers play this game and highly recommend everyone to do so that wants to play this game. The DLC is an added benefit of fun. Could definitely start out with the base game and then add the DLC to get used to it all. I just bought it all, but I'm still having fun."
12537,Awesome game. Very relaxing and easy to loose yourself in.
12538,"Great city builder with TONS of options. Really an immersive experience, especially if you have an active imagination."
12539,It's amazing that you can build roads and places to make money as a mayor of a new town.

12544,"I love this game! Its so fun to play. Its very challenging and puzzleing. 10/10 its great :).
Thank you paradox for making such a great game :0"
12545,Awesome game defently recommend it to other people however be aware that you cant have a potato pc or else it will crash
12546,"I'm not even that far in and I'm already having fun

It did take a quick google search to figure out how to actually power/supply water for my city because I didn't really understand it at first"
12547,"Definitely one of the best sims games.
I have played a 1000+ hours overall in game on different platform, and all that hours are worth it"

12556,good game i built city
12557,freezes on loading screen.
12558,"The only decent city building game, but the learning curve is steep."
12559,good gaem
12560,Great management game!
12561,"excellent game, quite immersive and great DLC's. Fine attention to detail. Hours of fun"
12562,"IF you like building cites towns or just tycoons i heavily recommend this, though the game is hard to learn and would recommend that you do the tutorial first don't recemend for people who don't like this style of game
"
12563,great time waster
12564,One of the best simulation games out there!
12565,
12566,"you can play god then get board, destroy your city, then rebuild till they do your bidding and worship you as the god you are. :D"
12567,This is probably the best city building game so far from what I know
12568,Best traffic jam simulator
12569,Awesome game. Better and more complex than Simcity
12570,Super fun City builder
12571,pretty good
12572,Lots of fun building cities from scratch.  I recommend this game!
12573,"I've been playing city building games since the early 90's with the original SimCity -- and have since played every SimCity game published to date. Cities: Skyline fills in gaps SimCity missed and put realism in a whole need level. The game itself is brilliant but once you start getting to downloading assets and mods and letting your imagination run wild, there really aren't many limits to Skylines. If you are creative, imaginative, have a love for how things works, problem solving, this gave is DEF for you!"
12574,Pretty good city builder tbh.
12575,"Great detail, very nice, vanilla maps could be improved and traffic is anarchy without mods.
Maybe have more road options in vanilla game"
12576,Paradox Game.
12577,"Good game nicely made but to get the best experience i recommend buying dlcs and getting mods from the steam workshop because it makes it nice, my only downside is that after about 120 - 160 minutes it gets kinda boring so i recommend not spending way to long playing it in a single day as it could get dry.

Overall Rating: 7/10"
12578,
12579,it is great with workshop mods but i tend to only build in squares as i am boring like that
12580,"Running on a new 13"" M1 Macbook Pro with no problems. Plays great."
12581,Um its good
12582,Ok.
12583,It is super fun! Lots of possibilities and great add-ons!!!!!!!!!!!
12584,If you liked Sim City as a kid but want game-play more fitting your own growth and comprehension as an adult this is the game of your dreams. A mellow game that lets you be as involved or uninvolved as you like with the processes of cultivating a city. Definitely worth watching some youtube tutorials as there can be a learning curve with your first city. I've enjoyed this immensely.
12585,Good
12586,I don't even know what am I doing
12587,amazing game
12588,Nothing quite so satisfying as applying real life civil planning methodologies to clean up traffic. It's mesmerizing. I love the traffic simulator in this game.
12589,its very hard and takes time
12590,yes
12591,Fuck yeah
12592,it is fun and good if you want to pass time
12593,goog game

12598,good fun
12599,"Relative fun city builder, but too many restrictions and railroaded gameplay prevents you from making well working small towns or rural cities without sacrificing a lot of services.

The age cycle of demographics needs to be seriously reworked also, death waves is not fun."

12601,It's good.

12658,"This game and all of its DLC is too cheap, Paradox should consider raising the prices and spreading the DLC out thinner,"
12659,"Very soothing, if you like games without stress this is definitely a good option"
12660,"Hands down the best City Building/Simulating game in the history of City Builders.
The best part of Cities Skylines is the traffic management for me.
I feel like a real genius when my city's traffic flow is above 80%. It's such a great accomplishment.

10/10 recommend this game for City Builders or any other simulation lovers.

And the mods, don't forget about the mods. The mods are the best part of this game.

My hours may seem low here because i been playing it on Epic since forever and just moved to Steam so i can easily install mods."
12661,"I played for 35 Hours so far, Vanilla is boring but modded is 1000% better and addicting. I will at some point play for 1000h. I have no life this is crazy."
12662,"Love this game.

The base game is great, it has a lot of building options. But once you get into their DLCs it gets even better. They make real changes and add lots more life and options/fun for making your new look even better.

Music is good, and once you learn about the mods is even better!
MODs MODs MODs!!! all the people out there making them, thank you. They make the game 10000x better.
The mods you can get make placing and move stuff easier to music packs etc."
12663,"i feel like fall into a black hole every time i play this game, time flies really quickly!"
12664,Yes.
12665,hey ho let´s go
12666,"With both it's pros and cons, this is by fair the best city builder out there at the moment. I keep coming back to this and getting stuck in, and the workshop ensures it never gets stale. There does seem to be a lot of DLC but they are all fun, and the core mechanics introduced are generally added to the base game at the DLC's release."
12667,I can't remember playing this much Cities Skylines. Guess that is a good sign?
12668,Great game. Needs lots of RAM though.
12669,"++ Detail: Track each citizens on the way from work back home. 
+ Easy if you want with opt-in hard mode.
++ Fun for maaaaany hours (even with just the base game)
+ great building and managing Tools
- discouraging DLCs
- some mechanics are not well documented/implemented (sill have no idea how to organize garbage collection in districts)"
12670,Addicting.
12671,369 hours in and still love it. buy it already you stingy pig
12672,"Hey you all! So this one will be short. With all the addons and DLCs this one is still the best city builder game out there (I do not count Anno as a classic city builder in terms of Sim City). For all you guys, who love to get lost in those simulations and need a relaxed, though complex gaming experience Cities: Skylines is actually a must have. So wait for an attractive sales window, download it and have some innocent good fun!"
12673,Gud game. Gud dlc. Gud mods.
12674,I do truly enjoy this game and been playing it for years
12675,honestly quite incredible
12676,good game for wasting time
12677,"Great game, I bought the new player bundle for 25 euros and I can totally say it is worth it.
I switched from xbox one edition to this, and it is worth the money. Especially if you like city-building games.
The top dlcs you ""need"" are:
1. After dark. It adds great additions to the game that you need, such as cyclists and prison.
2. Industries. It really depends if you like micro managing your assetsm if yes, then buy industries.
3. Mass transit. This dlc really helps with traffic, and allows you to build a larger public transportation network.
4. Green cities. Generally underrated, but in my opinion it is really useful. It can help your city because it has better garbage buildings and services, along with non-polluting buildings such as treatment plants etc.

Optional DLCS:
1. Park Life. Overall fun and can be a great source of money, again, like the industries dlc, you need to micro manage.
2. Campus. Similar to park life, but a very fun dlc.
3. Snowfall. Adds trams to the game, along with heating systems and snow maps, which I think will greatly improve your game.

Useless DLCS (in my opinion)
1. Natural disasters. I haven't really enjoyed it and it got annoying at some times. If you like destroying your city or experimenting with natural disasters, then get it.
2. Sunset Harbour. I haven't really saw what the dlc provided, the trolleys aren't much different from regular buses, I have used fishing, but instead of this DLC you should get a more important one.

Thanks for reading! Sorry if I missed any DLCS!"
12678,"Excellent
But!
If we want to play with mod, we have to play online! Because in offline mode, we have to manipulate several folders to be able to play offline.
This game is made to do urban planning, but many urban planning features such as traffic must be added to the game through mod, or a variety of roads and their design.
If it is to be an urban system, it must be complete so that at least many mods are not needed.
Spend more time developing this game."
12679,yes
12680,"Love this game, best city builder in my opinion. There are a few important DLCs to get (Free) that really improve the game though. 
Great fun and have spent many hours here, and I am still learning."
12681,Product requires recommend despite all other intervention.
12682,Solid
12683,No other city builder comes close to C:S—amazing community and highly customizable. Best purchase!
12684,If you ever liked playing Sim City as a kid then you will love this game. They really improve upon a classic city builder in many ways. Plus Steam community adds so much to this game. Really worth it if you are a fan of the genre.
12685,Play for hours!
12686,It's a great game for relaxation
12687,a
12688,cool game
12689,"make a new and better one, PLZ with more import and export of goods and what not"
12690,"A really great game with limitless imagination. The only thing limited in this is game is not just DLCs (not a bad thing), it would be performance. Potato computers and devices with beefy graphics cards and processors should be able run this game with a few assets and mods. As long as you don't download like a thousand assets and 40 mods and you are using a laptop with beefy Intel graphics, you should have a great time and trust me, I learnt that you shouldn't download too much assets. I learnt that the hard way."
12691,good game
12692,e

12698,"If you want to build large scale cities there really is no comparison. The DLC packs mostly seem good, plenty of Workshop support."
12699,a fun game
12700,"Absolute masterpiece, very fun especially with natural disasters. Throwing rocks that go around 16-20 km/sec at people and while there's a tornado and a lightning storm going on has never been more beautiful. Bugs and flaws aside there's a few of them but it's too minor and can easily be dealt with."
12701,"The best, most immersive city building game I've ever played, I'd definitely recommend it for anyone who is willing to spend their time enjoying the beauty that this game offers."
12702,the NPC urge to merge lanes at one location in order to hold up all traffic
12703,Honestly one of the most wildly addictive games I’ve ever played. It doesn’t make any damn sense that someone made a game this damn good. OUTSTANDING 👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾
12704,awesome game with lots of hours to play
12705,
12706,"good
"
12707,i love watching  40 hour videos to understand the basics of a game
12708,"It's a great City building game with an actual economy. If you are running out of money, just put a ""few"" toll booths, just a few you know... Not like I make 30% of my city income from them or anything.
These cities never stay idle with no requests, so you'll have to upgrade and expand it constantly. I recommend using a mod or two like the traffic mod, that makes you be able to control traffic. The traffic is always a problem.

I still have no idea how hydropower plants work, few cities got to go through tsunamis, but they didn't seem to care. Toll booths are really great btw. The time in this game goes weirdly, it takes my citizens graphically months to get to their work places. It's kinda cool to watch these peasants do all kind of stuff and just spectate. Btw I really like the toll booths, paying their monthly salary just to get home. It's great. Roads don't pay themselves.

I have no idea what to do with the tax money I get... I just... build... more.... toll booths..."
12709,love the game
12710,"Excellent sandbox city building game. My only complaint is the ""EA"" approach they are taking with so many DLC's. I get adding content and asking to have people pay for it but I'm just not a fan of the infinite DLC approach."
12711,"Love this game, I've wasted so much time playing it but I do not care it pleases my brain"
12712,"This is a great game which doesn't necessarily require much thought. You can either build a city you like with unlimited money, or go really in depth to make sure your traffic flow is always over 80%. You can zoom in close to build your perfect park, design an effecient bus route to take your cims on a ride. This game is perfect for relaxing, highly recommended."
12713,Nice city building game.
12714,Its fun but you will get frustrated for a bit trying to learn how things work to be the most effective.
12715,"Cities: Skylines is an awesome city simulator. I'm still a noob at the game, but I'm enjoying it. I plan on buying two additional DLC soon to expand the game further."

12719,"This game is sick. With all honesty, it does get a bit boring doing the same stuff over and over again but you can always find some enjoyment coming back to this game."
12720,"This is the kind of game that could become a hobby. It's so rich in detail, and it allows you to engage at so many different levels. I will say there's a slight learning curve – mostly because the tutorial is so painfully inadequate. I had to teach myself how to play from other users on YouTube."
12721,over 200 euros worth of dlc
12722,yes
12723,"Work of art game if you know how to build a city correctly, I do not."
12724,"its a great city simulator game, way better than sim city"
12725,It's an ok game. Good when I feel like making a city.
12726,An immersive city planning game ... the best
12727,This is a great game and is very addictive. I love being able to build a city and it's utilities.
12728,Roads and towns or something.
12729,It's good. even if you play in sandbox mode. get some nice looking cities going.
12730,"I have to leave the most honest review. 
I have enjoyed so much playing this game and building cities around. 
It takes all of the patients, but at the end it's worth.
Love it , I'd suggest it 10/10."
12731,hjghjghj
12732,nothing better than the sight of a giant cooling stack situated in the middle of the densely packed suburbs.
12733,"Very nice, accurate, precise, and addictive. I just wish that you can impose more specific policies and city ordinances on the game so I can develop a city on a certain doctrine or manner."
12734,meteor haha
12735,fun
12736,"Got boring after building my city to over 60,000. Save your money."
12737,"Great game, very fun, relaxing.  DLCs are too expensive tho"
12738,Great game especially if you have dlc's a bit slow paced but if you're in it for the long game then i recommend it to you.
12739,love it
12740,show de boleta
12741,"This is a very well modded traffic simulator with city building elements.

Expect the game to be rather expensive due to how much content was added via DLC, and for it to be as good as your computer is and no better.  The game's charm and power comes from it's simulations and management of an entire city at once.  Cities can be built that will bring any computer to their knees.

That said, I love it."
12742,"Grids. Grids. Grids.
Poop water."
12743,yes
12744,"It allows for indepth micro managment and supports steam mods, as well as the steam workshop."
12745,This is a really good city/simulator

12747,"This game is the most realistic city-building game I have ever played. Its graphics are beautiful, its city simulation is complex and interesting. Especially if you have an interest in urbanism or landscaping design."
12748,Very Fun

12750,"great game 
"
12751,City builder as it should be.
12752,my cictizens are starving
12753,Like sim city but difficult
12754,Awesome game
12755,As simple or complex as you want it to be especially with mods
12756,Created a freeway with a toll booth between every exit. 10/10 would toll again.
12757,Cool

12764,its wicked
12765,"It's Cities Skylines, you know what you're getting"
12766,epic
12767,might be one of the best city building-simulator games ever
12768,big city!
12769,"crappy game launcher, why every body need bloody game launcher it destroy the game it self
"
12770,good game but hits ur computer hard
12771,it is a fun game
12772,Everything
12773,Best Builder ever made. Nothing even comes close.
12774,Fun and engaging. 10/10
12775,Relaxing game. Didn't know your pipes could become contaminated though. City died of plague. Shame.
12776,Best city builder ever made. Every year I try to top the population total from my city the previous calendar year. 2021 was the best so far. Looking to beat that in 2022.
12777,))0_0((
12778,"I like this game.  I cant believe to date I have played for 555.5 hours.  Still getting the hang of it though.  At first it was kind of glitchy, but after I purchased a stronger computer it now works fine.  Good game."
12779,"great city builder, tons and tons of mods, endless replay value."
12780,A+++ Game Would reccomend to others thxs
12781,Good but there is so much dlcs...
12782,fUN
12783,its good
12784,really awesome game.  def recommend.  I find it fun to play
12785,"Vanilla is decently good - though much of the games mechanics, intentions, or ""AI"" are not explained at all so you kinda have to just keep trying and knit picking or you go watch some youtube tutorials.

Having some bundled DLC packs would be cool cuz searching the store for it right now is a shit show.."
12786,Fun game. Check to see what Expansion DLC you want. They all add something new and fun.
12787,Desperately needs better traffic ai
12788,"VERY good game, would highly reccomend!!!"
12789,Amazing game.
12790,W
12791,"Este juego es para un pùblico muy especifico ya que es una categorìa muy poco popular, pero me gusta y si lo recomiendo mucho."
12792,VERY GOOD
12793,"Cities skylines is quite the experience. You will spend countable hours building up a voluptuous city only for it to collapse due to an unknown plague, or a natural disaster. I would never not recommend this game to anyone. This game has changed the way I look at the world. Now I know how to build a city. Please play this game."
12794,"started off great
wanted to play again after 1.5 years -> requires (new game impossible without) a 3rd party account now...

screw that shit"
12795,Certainly better than anything EA has put out in the genre...
12796,very gud game
12797,my entire town was destroyed by a meteor 10/10
12798,tax evasion
12799,Nearly seven years old. Getting better every day thanks to the great community mods and assets.
12800,Public Administration Simulator
12801,The game was awesome but now the game keeps tripping even if i play with no mods.
12802,No
12803,"veri gud game, install all the mods that you can until your pc cant handle it... mods are amazing"
12804,"It's got a steep learning curve, and the potential to be super fun."
12805,good
12806,h
12807,"Just can't get into it.

I was a huge fan of Sim City and other simulation games growing up. There's something about this game that I just can't stand and I'm unable to put my finger on it. I've tried to play it so many times but after about 20 mins in and I'm trying to connect plumbing, I just give up. A shame because I've heard nothing but good things. It's just not the same."
12808,"Quite simply one of the best PC gaming experiences. The base game is great fun, but the amazing DLC, Mods, Community and YouTube content really make this game something special. If you like games like Theme Park, Rollercoaster Tycoon, SimCity, and Transport Tycoon then this game is an absolute must try.

The game-engine is a bit old, but with mods you can help bring the game up-to-date. Get the game and then head over to YouTube and start watching some tutorials from BiffaPlays and City Planner Plays. They have the most amazing content to help inspire even seasoned players like me. +2400hrs played at time of writing.

You don't need a killer PC to run the game, but lots of RAM helps (16GB+)."
12809,"very recommended game, it has such a helpful community and enjoyable mod/without mod gameplay"
12810,Fun
12811,gut
12812,It gud
12813,"This is a very US Centric approach to a city sim (there arent any others mind you), cars are king, walkable infrastructure is not systemic but as bypass to city problems (how can you not zone on paths?)

Its annoying and the more you try to make it better the more US it looks like you build square districs divided by huge interchanges"
12814,Hours and hours of fun
12815,"Except for the parts where Tsunami's wipe out your city, its everything you could hope for in a city building game"
12816,This game is what simcity could have been. Great screensaver game.
12817,"The best city builder out there. It's everything you would want in a city builder, management of taxes, districts, traffic and many more. This game is all about relaxation so have your favourite podcast/radio, music mix ready.

PROS
-The water physics is a step above anything you will ever see in other city builders most likely follow
-Tons of great mods
-Terraforming is so good

CONS
-No seasons
-No connection to other cities you create
-In game radio is forgettable

RATING: 9/10"
12818,"If you're interested in city building games, which I am. This is the best game of the genre!"
12819,MY FAVROITE GAME
12820,"After sinking a ton of hours into this game due to hyper-fixation and/or desire to just see stuff work, this game is super fun. By far the best city builder game out there with awesome support from the community!"
12821,Cities Skylines is one of the most in-depth and most realistic city-building games on the video game market today. I highly recommend it to anyone interested in a relaxing and engaging experience.
12822,love it
12823,This awesome game is absolutely on my recommendation list!!
12824,"amazing game had it on xbox and again on steam the game is amazing just wish they would add a map maker and trafic manager MOD as standard get the mod makers a job it would be nothing but good for the game and company.

5/5 will always play again."
12825,"older as we all know but still a very interesting game, many other games have tried to compete to this one and so far never got near it, sure graphics and buildings could get an remake but its still a great game."
12826,good
12827,fun
12828,very fun game
12829,"goof gsme
"
12830,"Hell ya
You like building buy this game
traffic always in the red like my bank acc"
12831,I enjoy watching my ambulances take an entire day/night cycle to arrive at an emergency because I have not designed the road layout correctly.
12832,ya build cities and stuff
12833,fun
12834,its hard until you get more income than debt but overall its fun
12835,decent game to pass time with
12836,"Yes, Cities is a great succesor over Simcity - it overcomes many of it's failures and fails. When playing Cities, it feels like all predecessors where proof of concepts.
On the other hand it adopted the most annoying facts:

- Grid-Based-Building (because of performance?)
Grid based building and construction will never remove the character of concept.
Eyecandies are nearly always only visual and never functional. Means 'painting' gaps with lots of  textures by youself (wtf?)

- Strict road centric design only (Hiway as baisc need! Moving in houses only by directly attached road possible, pathways and bikeways are just addons not connectable to roads, pedestrians can cross roads only at roadcrossings etc...)

- Roads cannot be designed by need - no you have to pick predesigned roads. And for good city planning, you need lots of them! - means addons, Argghhh

- Zones and buildings can only be one type of R, C or I - no mixing

And as conclusion: don't even think about building a big city! Just don't - as long you got a no supercomputer. And this fact renders all these Hiways, metros and airports simply idiotic. You can do very well with busses, bikeways and trams only - even in bigger cities (which, indeed, is an interesting fact).
Without addons, the game is fraction of value as with addons - be prepared they brake your game with every save&reload!

All the DLCs ae interessting, but be aware: they still incorporate the legacy gameplay and become boring very fast.

Edit: I forgot to complain about landscaping and ugly, steep riverbeds and coastlines, about functionality of parks (or alike), about ..... Eh, forget it. It time for a new game with a basic change in kind of construction and handling citizens."
12837,its fun
12838,"Best game ever
Best active community
Best support and new DLCs even after 5 years 
Just the best"
12839,"Cities Skylines is a wonderful way to spend some down time. I lose myself in the game, and it is very adaptable for how you want to play. Want to go big and solve traffic, services, and supply lines- it will do that. Want to build little towns with farms, mines in the hills, lumber mills on the mountains, fishing villages- it will do that. Sometimes I open one of my cities and let the cinematic camera play for a while and just watch how the citizens use the town. I don't really play with disasters turned on, but if you want to add some urgency to your gameplay, turn them on and start preparing to save your citizens and infrastructure from the mayhem that is coming. Bottom line: if you like playing sim style games this one is the one to get!"
12840,fun
12841,Relaxing game
12842,city skyline
12843,Your inner city planner's dream.
12844,very good
12845,Good.
12846,great game but mods make it a masterpiece
12847,This game makes hours feel like minutes
12848,city game good
12849,Must be among the best city builder games out there! Atleast with mods - it is my favorite goto city builder game!
12850,city
12851,"The city-building is very realistic and with the incorporation of mods this game becomes even more fun! You can make some really lovely scenic cities or a dump, make whatever you want!"
12852,"WORST game experience! YOU WILL DO THE TUTORIAL 5 times, get ready because there is no option to skip Tutorial and no info is sent to game servers so you won't be needed to. IT IS NOT FUN TE TUTORIAL IS BORING, PLEASE ALLOW US TO SKIP IT. Go play SimCity, these guys are bad,trully bad."
12853,Good simulation quality. Nice atmosphere.
12854,Awesome customizations and mods
12855,"In my humble opinion, this is one of the best games ever created.  Unlimited replay value due to mod support and one heck of a vanilla game that is flexible, yet well structured.  Excellent game that each of the DLCs has made better!"
12856,yes very fun game buy
12857,Learning curve is a bit steep but fun once you get the hang of it!
12858,It allows you to build your city the way you want. With the ability to have custom mods and assets brings this game to the next levle.
12859,Nice.
12860,"why my citizens are crying over dead person
"
12861,good
12862,"This game is one that I've sunk days into and enjoyed nearly every minute of. Between the continuing stream of dlc and free content, the massive amounts of mods, and the sheer creativity of the community, this game has done what even the venerated SimCity series couldn't. Create a 3d city-builder that is both easy to learn and hard to master."
12863,AMAZING
12864,"yes yes, i make island, good city, i give poop water then go boom. great city"
12865,Yes.
12866,fo sho
12867,Great game has spent many hours playing would recomend.
12868,"road too congested, please god just stop yielding to people when you're inside of a roundabout >:("
12869,"i liked it once i finally got the hang of it. good city sim, just you might wanna look up some youtube tutorials first"
12870,"Without mods it's pretty good but maybe not the best
WITH mods... it is hands down the best city builder ever made. But you best have a beefy computer because this game will quickly eat all of your VRAM and even more quickly devour your RAM. But with the mods that most of us play with the level of detail is just unparalleled, so drop some money on an upgrade if you have to.
Huge Kudos to Paradox for how they handle this game. *Some* companies may see a bunch of mods as a ""threat"" to their income stream from DLCs. Paradox on the other hand made their game easily extensible and straight up encourages modding. But everyone still buys the major DLCs because they're actually good and add to the game.
And I would like to extend my thanks to all the Cities:Skylines modders. Ya'll have done amazing work, and all of it essentially for free, you legends."
12871,sim city but much better
12872,Have too much fun killing people.
12873,funny
12874,Great game with tons of mods and the DLCs are great additions.
12875,"Easily the best, most complete and fun city builder out there.
With Cities: Skylines you can create your dream city, and I really, REALLY mean it. 
Take a look on youtube what variety of styles there are, you can build an European city, an American city, an Asian city! fantasy city, space city, wanna build a post-apocalypitc city? There are mods for it too! Even without mods, the vanilla game is still enjoyable! I would also suggest you some DLCs:
* Mass Transit
* After dark
* Sunset harbor
* Industries
* Park Life
"
12876,bad graphics
12877,"Still fantastically believable and coherent, and the availability of so many mods lets you decide what kind of game you want to play, or change that over time."
12878,"One can waste way to many hours with this game, at least if your into sandbox and city building."
12879,It was fun
12880,This game is SUPER fun. The only thing that I don't like are the DLC. Seriously?! OVER $200 on DLC! not cool. I still give the game a 90% because it's fun
12881,"Hi All in Cites Skyline just join the community. Can i ask why Steam pricing higher than Paradox Store, thought is was part off the same gaming."
12882,Probably the best city builder there is. The amount of assets and expansions will keep you fiddling with the game for many hours to come.
12883,"A great city building game. Lacks a financial challenge, graphics are outdated, the interface looks old and it's very expensive but still a good game"
12884,"Works just fine without any of the DLCs and with the standard edition. Can be a bit laggy if you're not using a very good computer, but it isn't too bad. The game is challenging enough and very rewarding, and always gives you plenty of opportunities to let your creativity flourish - I always come back to my cities with new projects in mind. Worth every penny."
12885,complex
12886,Nice game.
12887,Great game!!!
12888,running people's lives have never been easier
12889,"this game is very fun to play when my parents fight and im in my room for a really long time, it helps me drownd out the pain 1 city block at a time its very good to play when you are very lonsome and have nothing else to do when your locked in your room because you dont want to hear and see your parents fighting"
12890,Fun
12891,"Best City Builer ever made, the content packs really open up a whole new level of micro managing without being overwhelming"
12892,its great. period
12893,Good game
12894,yes
12895,Best modern city builder I have ever played! The DLCs also really improve the game to. You can pretty much make whatever modern dream city you want and even go overboard editing terrain and heights making all kinds of crazy things. A must try and play!
12896,"Whether you know what you're doing or not, you will sink hours into this game. Excellent mod support adds endless opportunity for expansion and allows customization to no end."
12897,Love the game.

12900,"This game sucks you in to the point your city is too much for your PC to handle and then forces you to make a new one just to experience what more than 5fps feels like...

10/10"
12901,"It's a very fascinating and interactive game! Mods make it much more fun, as you can add stores and other tools to make your city look more realistic. I wouldn't recommend the DLCs though, as you can just mod it. Hopefully a CS2 will come out in my lifetime."
12902,yoink
12903,Best game if you like building games this is the ultimate one! This is what sim city should have been. You can also download lots of mods/assets to the game which will enhance the city building experience. I can't wait for the new airport DLC to come out. Ill most likely be redoing my airport to my city.
12904,Best city builder bar none
12905,Lots to learn!
12906,awful
12907,good
12908,The best city builder game out.
12909,yes
12910,"This game gives endless potential for creativity and a crash course in city planning. You often go from creating the perfect park to having to rip out and redesign your infrastructure due to increased traffic demands. The community is pretty good, too. Huge choice of mods and lots of YouTube tutorials and lets plays.

Biggest flaws are the UI and the engine. The UI is a bit clunky and the engine bogs down a lot once your city gets bigger, but mods can help a bit with both of these."
12911,"There's not much competition in the citybuilder genre, the bar is set pretty low. This game could have been great, unfortunately paradox kills every game it touches"
12912,creativity
12913,"i like this game
"
12914,f
12915,"Very fun entertaining game, mods are a must though."
12916,This game is 100% in da bag. Grape!
12917,I wish possible size of the city's land would be only limited by the computer resources.
12918,"Grew up playing all the different Sim City games. This is a much more in-depth city simulator than those ever were. Easier to make money and set up your city if you know what you're doing, but every decision has a noticeable impact. 
Will easily waste many hours of my life playing this game. 10/10"
12919,has the balance right between enjoyment and challenge - and with plenty of Mods & DLCs infinitely configurable
12920,"This game is extremely addicting, with so many high quality Add-ons and an extremely proud and creative workshop community. I strongly recommend this game to anyone."
12921,fun
12922,fun
12923,nice game to play when you run out of creative or full of creative
12924,I think i like this game
12925,ong brooo its so good if u dont play PLS PLAY
12926,Very addictive.  Well thought out programming and vast workshop mods.  Wow.  I highly recommend this city simulation.  10 stars out of 10 without a doubt.  Get this.
12927,"I've had Cities: Skylines since June 2019, but didn't start playing seriously until several months later, and hot damn this game is a blast! If you want a game in which you can create a city the way *you* want, then this is the game for you! Distribution of public services, recreation, education, public transportation, and more are to be found in Cities: Skylines. And if you  really enjoy the game, you'll be able to choose from one of many DLCs! I haven't used any DLCs yet so I can't provide a review for those."
12928,
12929,"I have spent a decent amount of time with this game. It keeps bringing me back in for more, but the experience is much of the same every time. If you enjoy micromanaging roads, city planning, and utilities, this is the game for you. I wouldn't expect much more from a city building sim, so it's definitely a niche community, but the mods are absolutely necessary for aesthetic purposes. Who wants to build a block of buildings, not everything has to be a city; why mods are great. Overall, I rate this game a 7.4/10. It sucks me back in, but I don't know why."
12930,Cheesecake
12931,"An absolute must have for any simulator or transit game enthusiast. I have spent many hours on many different  platforms and loved it each time. PC, PS4, and Mac."
12932,ok
12933,"At first i despised this game, then i realized i was wrong."
12934,If you liked Sim City then you will love Cities: Skylines.  It is a very well done modern adaptation of the former game.
12935,Fun but decently challenging
12936,.
12937,What could be more fun than building and watching your city grow. You can also initiate disasters to those little buggers.
12938,its super fun
12939,Awsome city sim! lots of fun!
12940,"As a Sim City lover since 1998, I really love this game. Really grateful for it after the 2013 SimCity was a huge disappointment."
12941,"Just like what I remember from playing Sim City 4 as a kid, except with better graphics, a multi-directional camera, and so many DLCs it will make your head spin. Overall, the best city-building sim to come out in the last two decades."
12942,"It was the city builder I was looking for, it is so well done."
12943,Great Game
12944,Best city builder ever made to date.
12945,"design your own Beautiful City scapes

"
12946,very cool game
12947,Not worth it unless your going to buy all of the dlcs with it.
12948,"VERY GOOD FOR KILLING TIME 
"
12949,"it's a good game for the price
"
12950,great game with mods!
12951,Always a great chillaxing game. Great way to lose hours of your time after getting much too involved in the life story of a single citizen.
12952,Fun game
12953,"This game is a time sink. You will spend hours getting a road network in place, to then spend even longer making sure your specific roundabout is exactly symmetrical, to then realise the traffic is going in the complete wrong direction and you're an idiot. I love this game. I swear I only turn it on for 10 minutes - next thing its 5 hours later"
12954,"I've been playing this game for 2 years on PlayStation and it was good but never quite like that on PC, so one day I saw that CS was on discount on Steam and bought it immediately. I can say if you search for a good and modable city building game, CS is that game for you.
I 100% recommend Cities Skylines to the people who like city building games."
12955,YAWAH
12956,I LIKE FISHING IN DA WATER AREA
12957,Do you like city builders? Did you used to love that other city simulator that used to be awesome? You'll love this. Best city sim game ever. Amazing DLC and modding community. Amazing community period. I'm literally trying and I can't think of a bad thing to say about it.
12958,Brilliant
12959,its fun and relaxing perfect for casual gaming
12960,"Super fun game, especially w mods
"
12961,"YES
"
12962,Great
12963,"It's an okay game, I guess."
12964,"So this was supposed to be better than sim city. At the time I bought it, it was better. But now it seems like they're not trying to be better, instead they're trying to be just like EA (Electronic Arts) by releasing a million dlcs. And just like EA, they don't know when to call it quits and start working on the next CS. If I had known they were going to be milking it for the next few years, by adding every dlc they can think of, I'd have gave it a hard pass.
It was good enough with just the first few dlc. I enjoyed playing even if it did slow down past a certain population. But every time they released yet another dlc, it diminished my enthusiasm. Now I just click ""ignore"" when a new dlc makes it to my discovery queue without even paying attention to what the dlc contains.
I really hoped it would be better. I really hoped they would not sink to EA's level of greed. I am disappointed. It takes a LOT for something to sink below EA, but seems to me like Paradox did with CS. Way to go! Good job! Blah.

ETA: Why excessive dlcs are bad: It's like buying a frozen hamburger patty from a fast food place. Then having to pay more to have it cooked. Then pay more for the top bun and even more for the bottom bun. Then pay more for the ketchup, more for the mustard, and more for anything else you want. Not all together though, each thing you add costs you more. Then you have to pay for the wrapper unless you want it just thrown in the bag that you also paid extra for. Need a napkin? That'll cost you too."
12965,"I really love it. I'm not sure why, but I am enjoying this WAY more than I enjoyed Sim City 2013. Overall it feels great!"
12966,This game is great for relaxing and you can build any way you want in any way possible!
12967,Excellent game
12968,I downloaded a mod for a mod for a mod for a mod. I have no idea what a city is.
12969,"Great city builder. Slightly janky traffic AI that can lead to hours of frustration as your city comes to a frustrating halt and burns itself to the ground as your firefighters can no longer reach their destinations, but incredibly satisfying once the problem is solved. 

A must have for anyone who enjoys management games or citybuilding."
12970,amazing game
12971,Best way to relax with music for couple of hours
12972,great game
12973,Great game
12974,More roads.
12975,started planning my dream city and it turned into everyone's dream city
12976,fun
12977,I love this game
12978,I love this game..!
12979,Traffic is very realistic unfortunately
12980,Great game if you like building games. It is asset heavy and you can crash the game if you load too many of them. I loved the S*mC&tys of the past and this makes them appear as a children's game. It is one of the few I've played for years and is my game for relaxing.
12981,great game
12982,good
12983,a
12984,It's good. Recommended.
12985,Great game.
12986,It is a modern twist on the classic SimCity you loved. Would totally recommend.
12987,its amaing
12988,Fun
12989,it is realistic i like it
12990,"Good game if you play with mods or DLCs. But game optimalisation and default graphics (without mods) are horrible and worse than SimCity 2013. Than keep releasing boring addons with such a high price standards, you could fix the game performance as it eats as much RAM as you eat food in 3 days. To even make a highly modded project, you dont need 8 GB RAM memory. You don't need 16 GB RAM. You need 64 GB RAM or even more.

In the past time Colossal Order or Paradox Interactive haven't done anything to fix game performance in any way. This game also uses expired version of Unity engine. 

Game has potential and even due this horrible optimisation, I can overall say it's the best city builder available on the gaming market. Especially with mods."
12991,fun and interactive
12992,love the game
12993,Best game ever. A lot of thing to explore
12994,Lots of fun.
12995,經久不衰的好玩
12996,Great game!!!
12997,"This game is great, but it's outdated and needs a sequel. I start the game, remember the vanilla version isn't that fun, so IO then go on a mod download frenzy for 5 hours, then quit because I'm exhausted from looking for mods to add. That pretty much sums up my experience for the last few years."
12998,"It's a pretty awesome alternative to Sim City, I do enjoy Sim City more but this works as well."
12999,"It is very refreshing game, it takes you out of the real world."
13000,Amazing game. Endless possibilities with realistic traffic flow and citizen movement.
13001,Cities: Skylines is an excellent city building and city simulation game.
13002,"kinda fun, just not my kinda fun. lacks direction in most games."
13003,"Great Game, Horrible DLCs | If you have the money, go ahead and get them. If you cant spend more than the base price? Nope.

Amazing game. Addictive, fun, and wonderful.

Horrible way to release updates.
DlC's are meant to be full of content, extra stuff, and things that are good, but not really needed to enjoy the game.

I hate to break it to you Paradox, but an update is not the same as a DLC.
227$ for the DLC's? Half of them are radio music packs!

Most of them are good, but like cmon, 227$?

If you have the money to buy a good amount of them (I'd say 50$), then go ahead.
It's a great game, so many features, and the devs probably had a lot of work.

But the way that the DLC's are made? Nope.
This game is basically publishing new updates as DLCs.

Do I think every DLC should be an update? No way.
But a lot of the DLCs should be in the base game.

If you don't have more money to spend on this game than the game itself, I wouldn't reccomend.
If you do have about 70-80$ to spend, go ahead and buy it.

I just don't think its worth it, getting the main game only."
13004,great game
13005,I MAKE MY OWN CITY DRINK CHIT AND CUM
13006,i haven't played much but so far it seems like it could be fun
13007,Very good! Yeah!
13008,Very immersive. My favourite game.
13009,its fun if you get the right mods i think its fun its like 5 sometimes and 10 sometimes
13010,"Vanilla Cities: Skylines is a fun little game but to get the most out of it, you need DLCs or at least, creator content. I didn't watch my memory enough, not realizing just how big the packs are. My elderly computer put up a valiant fight, but failed. I've got a new computer, suitable for all my activities, and enough memory to play skylines for years to come.
The game can get very complex, I'm still learning some basic concepts. Look to the big players, check what mods they're using, and keep trying. Good luck!"

13013,This is best for Civil Engineer Player
13014,This is a great game for passing time and really appeals to my love of organised chaos.
13015,It's a good.
13016,nice
13017,"This game is great! you can make good looking cities, good performing cities, big cities, small cities or even all of them. You can also create wonderful things like poop rivers and volcanoes :) this game is a 1000/100 in my opinion."
13018,"idk, i like it"
13019,"Would recommend. First time I played I didn't notice that 9 hours had gone by. If you want your very own time machine, then this might just be the game for you."
13020,gud
13021,"I love this game wish we could have bigger land area, realistic flooding when it rains, rush hour traffic, trading with other counties or zones. I love this game."
13022,pog
13023,Great game
13024,gud
13025,"Too much expensive DLC which feels like it should have been part of the game, but base game is decent fun.

Also I fucking hate traffic."
13026,"Game is difficult, but amazing. Build the city, and if everything starts to break down, destroy it and start a new one. Would recommend, especially with the Natural Disasters DLC."
13027,Very Good buy during sale is the best
13028,"I don't play crap that tells you to do some thing, but does not tell you how to do it!"
13029,veri interesting
13030,Good Game
13031,s
13032,Cities: Skylines > Sim City
13033,"Very good game, highly recommend, the dlc's are amazing, but the base game is a bit empty.
The game includes realistic things like traffic problems, fires, robbers and many more, you can make your citizens happy with parks and plazas, the game has tourists which explore your city if you have things to do in it, I recommend getting stuff from the workshop, it makes the game much more fun. 



MAKE THE DLC'S A BIT LESS EXPENSIVE PLEASE GOD SAVE ME"
13034,"Very fun game, lots of creative opportunities & graphics are better than expected. Highly recommended with DLCs."
13035,"relaxing, great graphics"
13036,very fun and very easy to enjoy and especially sand box mode which lets you make your own city. (sorry if its confusing im just saying its a good game)
13037,Best city planning game ever
13038,very good game and city builder!
13039,dont like kel
13040,"Absolutely elite game. The freedom to design road systems etc is great, especially how you don't get locked into a straight line grid. Probably could improve on difficulty, as there are very little challenges in the game."
13041,"So much fun, play as often as I can. Shameless plug, if you like this game, play transport fever 2 or vice versa."
13042,"One of the best city builders ever made, provides just enough control to the player and just enough conveniences to let the player do what they want while not being over complicated. However it is Paradox so much of the fun content is locked behind further pay walls so keep that in mind when purchasing. For base game it is almost worth the price but definitely wait for sale as you will likely want to purchase further expansions."
13043,"Not played alot of city builders, but this one is really great, there is tons of stuff in the workshop for it, and it will keep you busy for hours. Tons of great youtubers to follow as well that play alot and build some incredible spaces."
13044,"Extremely satisfying game, mods are great and add so much to the gameplay. Best city building game on steam by far."
13045,gooooood
13046,yes yes very good
13047,hard to play
13048,A classic 6 years in the making. Still one of the freshest city builders out there.
13049,great game with tons of depth
13050,"I am an incredibly average player. I work ~50 hours a week and game about 1-2 hours a night if I can. I'm awful at city planning, but each iteration that I come up with is better than the last. Each save file I'm taking more time, understanding the ins and outs of the systems and it's incredibly rewarding."
13051,poo volcano make poo haha
13052,"really good game, reccommend"
13053,"A perfect game for when you have that ""city building sim"" itch that needs scratching."
13054,its grait for playing and super relistic you should try it out and it has lots of cool packs to try
13055,"Yeah, I mean, it's good. Good stuff. Fun times."
13056,Totally Hooked! A great game to get your teeth into and get creative... So many options!
13057,"This game is great. With mods, this game is everything lol"
13058,"Best city builder there is. Especially with all the mods in the workshop available. There is always something to do, something to perfect, something to fix, something to build. And when your computer says, this City is to large now, please do not make it bigger, you start a new city. And before a City gets to big, you have spend a lot of hours in it and for me that is mostly time I want to start a new one. Playing the game now for almost 2 years now, almost every day."
13059,One of the best city building games.
13060,You can pretend the cities you made are holding people hostages give the city a name like awwshwits and name districts by different jewish groups
13061,"I've had this game for awhile now and keep coming back to it. It's a great city builder! The DLC adds some great features, but the workshop is where you will find tools to help create the best city."
13062,"fun time passing game, definitely recommenced for people who like perfection at times"
13063,ruined my life
13064,great game fun to play
13065,"This is quite possibly, and I mean quite possibly, and when I mean quite possibly, I mean quite possibly, the BEST action apocalypse themed wave based zombie survival games. If any of my fellow 35 year old men are out there, this will help you through your midlife existential crisis. Would highly recommend to anyone who has played the previous instalment in the series: Tiger Woods PGA Tour 2014."
13066,"For years now,  I CAN NOT get enough of this game! Totally destroys what SimCity 5 was supposed to be and goes beyond what we ever expected in the SC series."
13067,k
13068,me allowed to put hospitals on fire with dlc. 10/10
13069,fun game
13070,buy it
13071,"The best city simulation game that i have ever played. deep, with expansive customization options, and top-notch AI. I recommend this game to anyone who enjoys the simulation genre, especially those who play city simulation games."
13072,idk
13073,its good
13074,Amazing Game!
13075,"Pretty solid game, and a staple in the city building genre. Some problems it has are ai issues and some of the base game maps having aesthetic problems such as floating highways or awkward terrain. Overall, very worth a play.

A huge part of my enjoyment of the game comes from the community around it. Very lovely work out there!"
13076,fjg
13077,Great game.
13078,"The problem with paradox games is that you think ""oh that was a good hour i spent on this game"" and when you check your clock, you see that you've just played for 36 hours without a break"
13079,"I like the creativity and freedom to customize whatever you want, whenever you want."
13080,very very very very fun
13081,Almost as much DLC as the sims
13082,game good
13083,good
13084,Best thing since Sim City4~~~~!!!!
13085,This game taught me just how big traffic jams can get
13086,"Honestly, this game is [i]the[/i] definitive city builder. I feel like it revitalized the genre and almost singlehandedly keeps it alive thanks in part to the continued support of the devs, and in part due to the community, which continues to both play and build the game upward with the steam workshop support."
13087,"Great game. It would be better if you solve the loading delays and crashes (without mods).,


thx"
13088,"The benchmark for city sims. Unfortunately, while the timeline goes into the future, there's no way to make cities car-free or even less car-dependent, which is a bummer. You're forced into building an American-style city with segregated zoning."
13089,"Probably the best city building simulation I've played. I've seen the occasional complaint about constant expansions to this game, but honestly, this is the best support for a simulation game like this I've seen and well worth supporting both by the developer and the community. EA/Maxis really botched their development and this was just waiting in the wings to eat their lunch. A sad ending to a great franchise, but its inheritor shows no signs of slowing down."
13090,It's kinda a boring game but it's still fun tho.
13091,"big city
low fps
10/10"
13092,So many ways to enjoy the hustle and bustle of a growing city
13093,very fun
13094,noice game
13095,fun but i hate trafic lol
13096,Good Game I played for 92 hours and blew up a city very good would recommend
13097,Nice

13118,"*Click*

""Noice"""
13119,"The game itself is great, especially with the workshop!
Instead of improving the game. This company decides to come up with a ton of DLCs that you can get for free on the workshop,  so they can cash in as much as they can. If you are new to this game, I recommend it all the way. A select few DLCS are worth it, but the rest are just garbage. The upcoming addition, Airport, looks like a lackluster!"
13120,fun and chill would download

- July 2022 Update-

Traffic still a F--king problem !"
13122,The game is all a strategy. If critical thinking is something that you find fun than this is for you. If you like making raw destruction... it is also for you as well.
13123,Good game with everything you'd expect for the price. Hope to use new updates.
13124,"I have been playing this game for years and every chance I coul get i would play this. On my PS4, on my computer and even at the internet cafe.  I love this game ."
13125,Amazing game
13126,This game is super fun. Building Highways and building dowtowns. The one downside is the difficulty. By FAR THIS GAME HAS BEEN THE HARDEST. It is hard to get into and to be able to build cities from start to finish without Major struggle.
13127,"Best city builder i've played. And i played alot of sim city
"
13128,I once loved this game but the fact that you need to register for an account to play it now has turned me off from playing it anymore.
13129,"i got this game to impress my crush called Conni and not only did she not date me, but I suck at it"
13130,Endless hours of Urban Planning fun!
13131,"The game is complicated, but it makes sense. Good graphics."
13132,"Mods have brought this game a long way, but I think the engine has started to show its age. The developers should consider making a sequel with an upgraded engine."
13133,wed
13134,"You will get hooked. There are so many hours of gameplay in this game. You will create massive cities, then kill all the citizens inside with a massive poop volcano. You are now god."
13135,"Great game, only problem is the DLC is very expensive."
13136,l
13137,"is a good city building game lots of dlcs to keep you going and almost infinate possiblitys
"
13138,is so fun sherk is poo
13139,"almost 2022 and we still have games were you either play 1080p or 4K, any other resolution is a blurry font feast. Even with mods the results are, at best, subpar and I sure have no intentions of squinting at small text for hours on end."
13140,.
13141,"If you haven't tried Cities: Skylines yet, please do. Sure, it's unrealistic. That doesn't matter though, it's fun as anything! Be aware of the social consequences that bulldozing people's houses and adding more lanes to highways have in real life. In Cities, those things are seen as solutions."
13142,i can practice being a sociopath in this game
13143,.
13144,This is my favorite game. It is a perfect balance of sandbox and realism. 10/10 bought a month ago 67hrs
13145,"Amazing game, great community, amazing mods and very time consuming"
13146,Kudos to the modders!
13147,"This game is so fun, great to pass the time and honestly SO realistic"
13148,fun
13149,its fun
13150,One of the greatest games ever if you love to build.
13151,waw
13152,"Great user control of detail, even down to the type and placement of a single tree, but the game is easy to grasp (@<7000 pop.).  Honestly, I may have sped up the learning process if I had read the manual, and there may techniques and strategies I'm not taking advantage of, but I was enjoying the game right out of the gate."
13153,best city building game
13154,"I am a loyal fan of city building genre from sim city series to even cities XL. But by far cities skylines is the best one I had ever played. I regretted myself to write this review this late when everyone is waiting for cities skylines 2. Even Paradox is not planning for sequel to this game, I will keep on supporting all the future DLCs. Also great thanks to modding community and asset creators. This game won't be complete without you."

13156,g
13157,Best city builder out there! Do I need to say more? Just get it!
13158,nice game
13159,best game ever
13160,An amzing relaxing game
13161,The complexity of the game is legendary and the game is real city planner.
13162,Best city building game ever
13163,"This game is awesome, I have build over 15 cities since I've bought this game. At some point it's almost impossible to continue building your city but the creators made an option in the option menu: Unlimited money, if you select unlimited money you can do whatever you want, but keep your money and population in green. otherwise you might have to delete your city like I had to do with 5 cities (Just a tip!). It's also easy to get a big city, just wait about 3 hours and you're almost at 10,000 residents"
13164,
13165,I love burning my pc with possibly too many workshop assets
13166,"It's like SimCity, but made 26 years later with a greater bevy of features. I suppose that is less a review than a literal stating of facts, but it's the best you're gonna get from me."

13169,Good citi build!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
13170,"good game, need more women."
13171,two thousand hours!
13172,The Game can go endless.
13173,Such a fun city building game.
13174,I can't believe I already played this game for 3391 hours. Can't wait for the new airport DLC. I do hope the developer can add 32:9 ultra wide monitor support.
13175,good
13176,incredible game. So much freedom to build whatever kind of city your heart desires.
13177,Yes
13178,"I love how this game is a good gameplay, with active community content - custom building, custom preset interchange, custom map and so on. The DLC I think is worth the price for additional content to the main game. 

: D"
13179,I like building things baby
13180,"The greatest video game of all time but... stupid cash grab dlc bullshit.

13190,One of the best games that I've ever played.
13191,Its ok
13192,"Very cool game, I love it how I can build anything I want. If you get this game just letting you know, your limit is your imagination!"
13193,this game gave me autism
13194,good game
13195,"cant load or start new worlds, cant get a refund. avoid."
13196,"It's always fun spending countless hours meticulously planning and meeting your citizens' needs, then wiping them out with a meteor storm tidal wave 1-2 punch (after a proper save of course). Brilliant creators increase the game play dramatically with useful tools, add ons, and custom DLC. It's a slightly different game each time I play."
13197,
13198,Good
13199,Despite a few bugs and problems with some mods and assets this is a superb passatempo! I am looking forward to upgrades
13200,"build city very good
"
13201,"Good game, very user friendly."
13202,Great game!
13203,fantastic
13204,"If you liked SimCity, you'll love Cities: Skylines"
13205,"Stumbled over Biffa's content on YT, and found myself curious about the game. The hope was to have something like SimCity 4, which I played as a kid, and Cities: Skylines is a lot of fun, and while it's skewed more towards the aesthetic than the management I enjoyed in SC4, it still offers diversity when it comes to playing styles. Managing the traffic in particular, without mods, is a real headache, which I thoroughly enjoy. xD

It's not the fun challenge of world building SC4, or as large-scale where you could connect several cities, but it's still a great and entertaining city building game. The only DLC I would consider necessary to get the full enjoyment out of it is Mass Transit. All in all, I really recommend it."
13206,good game
13207,"The game is great. Playing since the last 1 year. Mods are a blessing. One issue is all the vehicles taking same lane and causing congestion. Although traffic manager mod is helpful in this, having a vanilla solution would be great. Eagerly waiting for CS2"
13208,Really good city building game
13209,:)
13210,great game to kill time on. you will asbolutely need some mods to help the game balance and traffic flow smoother. easy to get the hang of real fast and figure out how things work. 10/10 even without DLC
13211,"Very entertaining and addictive. 

For anyone who has interested in a cities building game, this is a right choice to get. 

This game has a lot of features, which everyone mostly want and offers variety to build your perfect city with your own creativity.

It may require big RAM to run a game but 8GB RAM is enough to run the game.

10/10"
13212,Very fun and addicting. I just wish they explained all the controls. It took me a long time to figure everything out with the buttons.
13213,"Currently the best in the genre so the best of its kind.  Many user made assets and mods.  Easy to learn, hard to master."
13214,I love it!
13215,"everything
"
13216,Addictive.What's more to say...

13219,nice game
13220,"I made a city powered completely by their own waste

pretty neat"
13221,
13222,Good game. hours of fun. DLc not so much a fan of.
13223,"Good game, although DLC are super costly and game is much better with user made content..."
13224,"Best city building game ever.
The mods made it far way better.

I recommend to tank your CPU and RAM for this game, it doesn't use your GPU that much.
The AI and simulations (Traffic, physics, weather etc.) will eat up a lot of CPU and RAM.
Also a tip, put this game on your SSD when downloading it. It helps a lot with loading the maps, assets and tons of mods that you surely subscribed to.

For DLCs. Wait for sales, they are really cheap and optional."
13225,ppp
13226,Time flies when im playing and im always looking for new ways to maximize my city
13227,"i make city, yes. people leave my city, yes. 10/10"
13228,"This game got under my skin like few games have. I dig making realistic cities on mod maps. Stock is fun, but mods are the game changer. Watching YUMBL, City Planner Plays, Akuras, and others to get inspiration on how to take this ""game"" and turn it into a more realistic simulation is captivating."
13229,Great City Builder. Love the game and with mods it's even better.
13230,"Great game if you want just a city builder to relax on, Highly Recommend"
13231,Good gaem I would recomen if you like bulding I am now a arckatecht! :-)
13232,"Pretty epic
Some people went swimming with tsunami thingy

pretty good bean machine 11/6"
13233,Very relaxing and easy to understand. :)
13234,There is so much more to building a city in this game. There are extremely fun DLCs and other ways you can enjoy. Sandbox mode lets me build anything I could possibly think of. I love this game.
13235,very awesome
13236,"siempre fue un sueño construir mi propia ciudad
"
13237,Get this now!!! This game is the best so get it. It so fun and interesting. The time fly's by when playing this game. This game has kept me playing all day some times. I have brought loads of dlc's and they are all great. Mass transit is the best dlc in my opinion. If u don't have this game get it. U wont regret. The controls and the game play are so great. The style of the game is so good. The graphics and everything else is wow!!! Also get the 25 tile mod.
13238,this is the only city builder really so... its fine
13239,"Very addicting
"
13240,Addictive the mods really are what make it shine.
13241,very fun
13242,It's aight :)
13243,Really fun and surprisingly educational? It takes some time and dedication but with enough of that you can have so much fun.
13244,Don't forget to save...
13245,"Pros:
This is the best city builder.
One-way roads don't exist in SimCity for whatever reason, so this is the only game I've seen that actually lets you manage your traffic at all.
Building a metropolis from scratch is very satisfying.

Cons:
No lane management by default is pretty annoying.
Population is very scaled-down. Small house hold 10 people and skyscraper only holds 30. I'm not sure that's realistic :/
No multi-use zoning available in the game, even with mods. I expect more from the developers, especially since they're a European dev, not an American one.
All buildings must be accessible by car, and there are no pedestrian-only zonable roads, or even small roads, which makes the creation of a dense downtown nearly impossible, especially when combined with the lack of multi-use zoning.

Overall? This is a fantastic games that can give you hundreds of hours of entertainment! Although there are cons, there are far fewer than any competitors have!"
13246,Best city-building game I've played.
13247,"6 years later, continues being the best city simulator on the market. I play it on linux, but using the windows version (through proton), so the mods would work."
13248,shush
13249,Very good game!
13250,Got this game in steam sale. I'm a city builder guy love playing city building games but this game is at next level. Definitely recommended to others to get the game. In love playing this game. So much realistic
13251,nice
13252,cool
13253,VERY MODDABLE
13254,Very addicting
13255,Great game! Would play again. Recommend to @rinalds
13256,-
13257,ballz
13258,Much better game than Sim City
13259,"I find it to be a better city buildler sim than most, but the cost of the DLC's for an older game is much too high."
13260,Its a good game to chill while high ngl.
13261,fun
13262,x
13263,Its the best city building game I've ever played.  Traffic is the ultimate enemy!

13292,"its good i guess
*you should add mods trust its much better w/ them"
13293,
13294,"No mater the outcome, It seems easy to build a city and have it be a productive one!  I've played with NO DLC's as well as no MOD's and seems to me jest dandy!  I say anyone should give it a try!   Nice to pass time with and learn some things as well!  P.S.  Don't spoil it by running it fast!  Let it build gradually!  I Find it better in base speed!  MOD's or not.  IT""S OK!"
13295,"This is the best sim game I have ever played. Period. 

Fair warning: it is tough to get into. I suggest checking out a couple of Youtubers as you get started to get some of the basics down and see some of the mods that make the game its most fun."
13296,Incredible but tedious. Ultra tedious.
13297,bEST CITY BUILDER
13298,"Sick game
"
13299,NICE GAME
13300,It's alright.
13301,"Great modding community that keeps constant, high quality content coming out. DLC usually add fun aspects to the game that stir things up. Very fun."
13302,Harder then u think.
13303,if you like buildings and roads its pretty cool
13304,really awesome game
13305,awesome.
13306,a
13307,"This Game: chaotic Good
Why?: You can just play it normally and build a functioning beautiful city,
you can also build a non function purely asthetic city, with all the details you want
YOUR creativity is your only limit
This also extends to your last freedom.........You can just torture a whole City, with enough mods
and some of the DLC it's possible to completely ruin everyone in your city in the most entertaining ways possible: 
E.g. Flooding the city in its own poop
Starting a meteor-rain
Just bulldozing perfectly fine houses
Building crematories at every corner of a road, right next to an recycling yard"
13308,Kool game fun for Kids and Krazy people
13309,It's just fun to build and play
13310,It's a great game if you like to design systems and think you can build a better city. The game can be played as simple or as difficult as you'd like. The number of Steam Workshop plugins is amazing. Highly recommended.
13311,<3
13312,Fantastic Game with excellent options for creativity as well as problem solving.
13313,I really love Cities Skylines but i just cannot justify spending £170+ on all the DLC for this game. How to rip off your customers
13314,realistyc game to build ur own society
13315,Cities
13316,"I have a friend who is from Artvin, Turkey. He really loves this game. His race has very interesting architectural examples. In Turkey, people in Blacksea Region are usually known as contractors building very interesting structures. If you have any friend from Blacksea, Turkey, don't forget to gift this game. They will absolutely love the game."
13317,It's pretty good imo
13318,.
13319,GOOD!
13320,Very in depth city building and managing simulator
13321,
13322,I love returning to this game every now and then. It's really calming (as long as messing up traffic does not stress you out).
13323,Immersive and you can get lost in building your cities
13324,"I really dont play video games much to begin with, but i saw a video on youtube and it seemed interesting. After 80+ hours in within a few days  goes to show ya"
13325,nice game
13326,yes.
13327,1038 hours. No regret!

13332,"It's nice, it's soothing, you get to see stunning cities emerge and evolve over time.

It's raved about for a reason. Probably the only reason I'll stop playing this game is when the rumor City Skylines 2 is revealed."

13337,literally a must have
13338,relaxing game
13339,A great city management game made better by mods. The rumoured second coming of Cities: Skylines will hopefully include such mods as standard which sadly have become necessary to use the true limits to their fullest extent.
13340,Building big city is fun

13344,"Love this game.  It's everything we wanted from Sim City, except better!  :)"
13345,Great Game!
13346,"So relaxing, put 100+ more hours on XBOX version but I like this one better because of all the mods and customizations."

13351,"I loved the game, however I didn't like the fact that I had to keep paying for the additional content but big annoyance not really I just loved the game and all of the other attractions that my brother gave to me a couple of years ago that's how I came across it anyway!"
13352,"- Full of little annoyances.
- Policies should have expense estimates.
- Did not find much of a reason to build anything fancy or anything beyond providing the necessities and being plainly efficient.
- Leveling terrain is a real pain.
- I could not build parks in some tight places that would otherwise be ideal.
- Taxes are a total mess. One example - a building upgrades itself only for the tenants to discover that they do not like the tax in that specific context and abandon the whole building.

We should have better city builders by now, pity.

13355,"very nice game, extremely fun, just keeps an eye out for... everything really, literally everything's out to get you"
13356,HAAARRRDDDEEEE SHIT
13357,God wholesome fun
13358,"When this was released, it was already clearly the superior city builder. Since then, mountains of additional free and DLC content have been added, and the incredible mod community (and support in the game) made the available building tools FAR broader and easier to use."
13359,Fun
13360,A great city builder game. I enjoy it but some areas need work. It was kind of hard for me to mod the game. This game definitely had the Sim City vibe to it from the early 2000's.
13361,not bad

13365,Brings me back to the days of playing Sim City in grade school.
13366,"This game is a casual no-brainer.

If you want to be creative and make a pretty city, you're in the right place.

If you want a challenge and deep mechanics, then I can't recommend it, there's no real difficulty or depth to the game."
13367,It's cool :thumbsup:
13368,"addicting,  whenever i see new assets, it makes me play more and more and cant help thinking myself i need to design a city better the last one."
13369,cool game
13370,Really a creative and constructive game-line. I really love its reality and visualization.
13371,it's alright
13372,yes
13373,Best city builder ever made.
13374,"Great Game. The DLC and modding community makes this game playable even now, long after it was released."
13375,"Solid game, but vanilla lacks some critical tools."

13390,gud game you do need some of the dlc to get the full experience
13391,I think that this game is pretty swag because I saw Shlapiro splay it
13392,very fun simulation and building/management game.
13393,After playing Sim city my entire life. I really do enjoy the flexibility of this game. it is my all time go to now.
13394,"really nice game but after unlocking everything you wont play anymore, cuz you will need DLCs"
13395,Best city simulation out there to date. Hoping for a Skylines 2.
13396,i love this game its fun and you always wonder where the days gone. but i feel as the game isnt too much without the industries DLC.
13397,"Love this game and all of it's creativity. Community is great as well
"
13398,"This game is great, REALLY recommend, and pretty good graphics. I can also play this game at a pretty good quality on a lower end device. This game is great, and once you get the hang of it, you can create a megalopolis."
13399,Its just a great game!!!
13400,i am never board when playing this game!
13401,the best bro.
13402,The game is good on its own but if you add some mods it is really fun to play
13403,fun until shit starts dying
13404,"I'm entering the game by watching many videos.  it is complex and very pretty, very cohesive and broad scoped, pretty much a dream to a true simulation engineer.   as a starting player, it was easy to be daunted by the sheer number of mods that need to be applied to accomplish the magic you might see in a video, and i feared the vanilla would let me down, but it plays fine.  if you worry that the first stroke of the paintbrush will spoil the future masterpiece, it isn't terribly costly to demo and fix it later, and if you leave room for pathways and upgrades to roads, you probably won't need to fear it later.  10 thumbs up!"
13405,"i love seeing the cims being confused going through nonsensical intersection.
"
13406,.
13407,Such a nice game!
13408,"The best city-builder out there! The visuals may seem a bit dated, but the complexity of managing a city and its traffic (!) is still a fantastic experience! Give this one a shot as it is frequently on sale and if you enjoy it you can jump into DLCs :)"
13409,gud
13410,afwdadwaw
13411,Really fun but I crash to much. It's not my PC too it just crashes when I load up a new world
13412,It was really try to simulate like a real city. Quite fix with my expectation.
13413,This is one of the most creative and interactive games ever! There are multiple multiple options along with the options to have it easy with unlimited items and finances or make it realistic. I 100% recommend this game to everyone who enjoys their own creativity and interactive cities!
13414,daddys milk
13415,"Making an exact replica of New York City, then flooding the streets with sewage"
13416,Good Game
13417,This game is way better that Sim City. Way more detail is involved and you can just do a whole lot more with the controls. I love being able to manipulate the terrain so that you can fit just about any building anywhere you want or need it to be. I'd give it it 8.5 out of 10. Every game needs improvement and this one will get them.
13418,"I played the original Sim City when it first launched, and loved it. City: Skylines has illicitted the same response and completely modernized the interface, features, and of course the graphics."
13419,The best city building game ever!
13420,Relaxing
13421,Too many hours spent on this game
13422,10/10
13423,VERY GOOD GAME BUT DONT RECOMMEND FOR 4GBRAM USERS
13424,"if i was a rapper with $20,000,000 in the bank account I would have bought this game full price and all the dlc right away as this game is worth every penny and I like that you can make a town flood with sewage as I find it funny but stop laughing when I go broke as half of my businesses are destroyed and a quarter of the population leaves the town buts it's a good laugh. 9/10 better than cod for sure"
13425,This is one of the best games ever made
13426,"the only thing you need to worry about is traffic
"
13427,very fun game altho its very hard or your pc
13428,great game very fun especially with mods and extra assets
13429,"It's crashed every time I tried to make a new game, I believe that it is because I have a bad PC, so I can't really make a review for a game I haven't played."
13430,NICE
13431,This game is still relevant many years later—probably the greatest city builder since SimCity 2000. These kind of games only come once a decade.
13432,buildintg
13433,Best city builder Ive ever played
13434,Awesome game! can play for hours! also has a great physics engine and great graphics and is a great game for city development and real estate nerds like me and you can create cool stuff! overall a 8.6/10
13435,"Deep yet accessible sim. Watch out, it'll suck your time!"
13436,I like this game because you can make different things plus you can add mods to it so you can have a better experience. I have most of the main DLC's which even make it better. If you like building things such as cities than I strongly encourage you to get City Skylines.
13437,Overall very good and interesting game.
13438,"You want a way to kill time and build awesome sprawling cities? Perfect! All you've gotta do is hit that buy button, and you'll be on your way to downloading every mod you see, then soon you'll be doing unbearable road math and fixing the slightest transportation issues your Cims might encounter. This is truly a great way to become the ultimate city planner :D"
13439,"good
"
13440,"IT IS FUN
"
13441,PLAY IT! IT IS FUN!!!!
13442,I love this game because it is so much more immersive than any city simulator I have ever played.
13443,beast
13444,"The game can be as easy or hard as you want it to be. If you are not too bothered if your citizens are happy, then you can easily build a large city, however, if you want to ensure they are happy, you need to think ahead when you are planning roads and determining area types so you are able to plan in new services like public transportation. Overall, a really good game, that shows you how challenging it is to build a fully functioning city."
13445,"Yeah, its Cities: Skylines, you ether play the game for days with mods, or you play for 10 minutes without them. It's still fun building a city with horrible traffic and a population of 1 million. Just see how many times you crash the game, and have fun."
13446,gud build gam
13447,"Recomend, very good, like factorio but city.  Very addictive."

13463,YES :D
13464,cool game
13465,Das beste Spiel seiner Art
13466,Probably the best modern city builder game. It is a good deal of fun and fairly relaxing until your city gets huge and traffic management becomes the focus. Lots of support and additional content has been released over the years.
13467,Now that's what I call Roadrage.
13468,It's basically a model train set on steroids.

If the game doesn't have sound make sure you have Windows Spatial Sound turned on before launching.  Other than that I haven't had one issue and think this game is going to go down as one of my favorite ever.  I've restarted sooo many games already, fairly steep learning curve, yet no pressure to 'level up'.  Just love it <3"

13495,"Very enjoyable, especially in multiplayer. Infinite amout of mods aswell"
13496,
13497,Great immersive experience
13498,Easily the best city builder on the market right now. The vanilla game is pretty fun to learn the basics of the game such as traffic management and services placement. However the game can be quite shallow after a while without mods or DLC.  Either way this is 100% must buy for anyone who likes city builders / transport games. RIP sim city.
13499,"I have gotten lost in this Game for weeks at a time.  its that delicious.

13513,Very good!
13514,"Cities: Skylines is hardly a city building game it is actually a traffic simulator. You can't have fun by making a city you like instead you are forced to look at the traffic management most of the time. The game scarifies fun for realism. In order to actually make a functioning city you need a degree in city planning or watching 100 hours worth of tutorials in order to make a city which functions you can't just hop in and make a city you want to make. 

Also for realism in traffic the game isn't as complex in order areas like economy and society management.

Paradox is far worse than EA when it comes to DLC, stuff which should be free updates, cost way too much money ."
13515,"it's good sauce, don't get lost in it . 9/10"
13516,"I actually really like it. I'm still slowly learning about the game but I really like building cities and flooding my own city and being an arsonist (using natural disasters pack) 

I am also building cities and designing the roads, road shapes etc."

13547,This is quite the fun and engaging game. If you are into building simulators then this is a good one.
13548,"Its okay, could need some more content though."
13549,May as well be EA. At this point that might even be preferable.

13552,"Amazing game
"
13553,"Have you ever played a game and wondered where the entire day went. That's Cities Skylines in a nutshell. There are so many ways to play this game there's not enough time or space in this review to do it justice. This game is perfect for creative types and those that like challenging game play. This game is a blast both modded and vanilla.

 I do recommend adding Mass Transit, After Dark, Parklife, Green Cities, and Industries DLC, in that order. Sunset Harbor is also a great addition to the game. If you like City Builders, you can not go wrong with Cities Skylines."
13554,Best City Builder on the market. Base game is good the Big DLCs make the game better and the massive collection of workshop content makes the game amazing.

13560,great with mods
13561,So good for my OCD.. Need. To. Build. In. Perfect. Mirror. Image!
13562,I approve this game.
13563,one word this game is Perfect
13564,"Bought this game a few years ago on sale after getting into the city-building/god-sim genre with games like sim-city, etc. As a BASE game, its fairly easy to moderate to pick up and enjoy for several hours, but then once you understand the ""formula"" it kind of gets redundant. So after some hours I put it away. A few months later I happened to discover the mod-world for this game and THATS WHERE IT REALLY SHINES. The mod world is EXTREMELY extensive and a quick youtube search will show you how to easily set it up and get rolling. Add that to some of the DLCs that really change gameplay experiences (industries, sunset harbor, campus, mass transit, snowfall, and a few others that I can't remember ATM) -- get these when they go on sale -- and I have found myself severely addicted to this game. It literally is endless what you can do with this game and I have ""re-discovered"" it over the last few months. The only thing that may stop me from playing this game is when/if Cities-skylines 2 comes out. 

To run this game well - with base graphics and no mods - you need a decent graphics card, nothing crazy. However, a good CPU is a MUST for this game. To put it into context, I am running the game at its highest settings (only have a few lighting/shadow mods on board, making it slightly more intense than base-game graphics) with an AMD RX580 8GB (4gb just doesnt cut it) + Intel i5 7600 at 3.8. The CPU is overclocked about 19% and my graphics card is running with stock AMD ""performance gaming"" settings.

TLDR: Highly recc this game if you are into this genre and are willing to tinker with mods & some DLCs. If you arent willing to do that I would wait for a cities skylines 2. Otherwise this game is beyond fantastic."

Also, sort of hard for people new to the whole area of ""make your own city"" games. If you haven't played sim city or others like it you're gonna have a hard time the time it takes to get good and actually gain skill is very consuming so make sure you have the patience to put up with it.

13581,I always find myself coming back to this game. It's literally still the best city builder and 2021 is coming to a close. Let's hope it still holds up through 2022.

13598,It is awesome
13599,"The game is garbage.
The building tools are sheer malarky, ""Bus lines that won't connect.""
Over-saturated interfaces with benign advisors.

""Build a cargo train station"" Oh yeah and connect it to what? Nothing?
At least in Sim City when you ran the railway out of the town it connected with another town.
Not here. No, forget building that if there is no other town in existence.

Apparently in this game you are the sole existing Mayor or whatever.
The game is empty, barren.. Boring.
It feels like a second job, rather than entertainment.


Oh yeah, be sure to zone your industry zone that you just zoned,
otherwise it's not the desired zone you've been zoning for..

13601,Its great
13602,GREAT GAME SO MUCH DETAIL
13603,Very fun building game. Would recommend to people who want a future in city planning or engineering.
13604,Brilliant and timeless game

13606,fajny symulator korków
13607,Awesome city building sim.
13608,yes
13609,um goo
13610,Rabbit hole Warning!!
13611,I love this game.
13612,"HaHa F"""""" ur PP Nuke Go bruhhh"
13613,Good Game
13614,"its not game, its a peaceful addiction"
13615,get your wallet out if you want a fun game pretty bland without DLC
13616,"its a pretty chill game that is also very expandable with mods. For the first few hours i didn't get anything, but once you get the complexity, your imagination's the limit."
13617,GOOD! VERY MUCH!! My inner architectural and urban planning desires been awakened further!! It's like SimCity but better in so many ways and the modding community made it more fun! GAME CHANGER! 10/10. AMAZING
13618,Enjoyable. Sit back and chill.
13619,best city building game
13620,I could play this game for an eternity
13621,Best city management game in the market so far; very realistic. That's the key.
13622,Pretty chill city builder.
13623,Fun and relaxing time killer.
13624,"Building your city eats hours... days... weeks... and even months of your time. Bought the entire package on the PS Store and left it for the PC version, because I've seen the endless possibilities with the mods created - even so, I purchased everything (except the radio DLCs which are gladly not compulsory). For city-building simulation fans, this is a must-buy, must-own game.

"
13625,"If you've very played sim city and wonder what a working next gen version would be like, get this"
13626,.
13627,made an infinite power source with a poo river and a dam today 10/10
13628,"Really fun, still loving it even though its rare I have time to sit down and play

Just sitting around watching the city grow, poop lakes overflow and random meteors create holes that can be put in the middle of new nature reserve space"
13629,"It is a great game definitely recommend to others  great for building amazing cities that have a sense of realism and grandeur about them.
The game is has great graphics and isn't straining on computers
but I don't recommend a lot of the DLCS as the value of the workshop is more than most of the DLCS combined
Buy:
After Dark
Parklife
Industries
Green Cities
Map Content Creator Pack
Don't buy unless on sale
Snowfall
Natural Disasters
Sunset Harbour
Unessential but do buy when on sale
All Content Creator packs- when your playing without them it doesn't feel right particularly the trains pack which I often use
Unless you don't listen to other music the radio packs are virtually pointless
All other mini DLCS are unimportant and only get them when on sale.
To reiterate only get the necessary DLCS but just stick to the workshop because it has more variety and imagination"
13630,"What an amazing game to get your creative juices flowing. Creating and recreating roads and connections, zoning and thinking of the best places to place resource buildings while trying to mirror real life somewhat or just going bonkers with your own logic. This game allows it all. With lots of great community created mods and a dedicated official YouTube channel that highlights some of these mods, you really feel the care the Developers and the Community have placed on this game. Loving this and eagerly waiting for future sequels."
13631,"allows for you to unleash your creativity, and allows for you to change how much of a challenge you will have
"
13632,dlc
13633,Great fun and playable on basically anything since blackberry phones
13634,good game
13635,"Игра супер, давно хотел приобрести. Хорошая цена, куча модов. Правда для основных нужно попать дополнения, чтобы они работали, но тем не менее, на дополнения очень часто бывают скидки. Лично моя оценка игре 4,5 из 5."
13636,It is a really fun game if you like builders.  I would play more but for some reason it gives me eye strain which I am prone to so I have to play it in short bursts and not while working.  But it is a recommend.  I just have crappy eyes.
13637,tes
13638,Perfect game for sitting back and relaxing after a long week.
13639,"This is a cities building sim that I can sit back and enjoy.  The way the genre was supposed to be.  Most of the DLC's are improvements and add to the  game, and the community has out considerable time in making custom add ons."
13640,fun game to relax and design some cities.
13641,"Only get this game on PC, mods are what make this game fun after the first 20 hours. Make sure you have decent RAM and only get it during sales. This game allows for insane levels of creativity, but also is very complex. Luckily, the game will make sure you aren't too overwhelmed."
13642,i like roundabouts
13643,great game can get lost in it for hours
13644,the MODS!
13645,w
13646,This is the greatest building simulation game i've ever play!!!
13647,"The best city builder bar none.

For me this game is a means of catharsis. I immediately fell in love with the game watching Biffa's many traffic fixes and started with just the vanilla version with no mods. Time always drifts by while I try to perfect every aspect of each newly created city while unlocking more content and achievements. Dozens if not hundreds of hours of entertainment with vanilla alone, but the game really comes alive with its DLC and never-ending community workshop asset and mod contributions.

Any complaints I have about the vanilla version (road size and variety, lack of traffic controls, customization) is taken care of with free mods from the community workshop. You don't need the expansions to fully enjoy what Cities: Skylines has to offer, but mods and community assets are highly recommended for the aspiring city builder.

Not sure if this game will ever get old. Highly recommended."
13648,great fun
13649,\o/
13650,Best game for spending time
13651,i be playing dis game
13652,"Really cool game, very detailed simulation and enjoy playing it. I am disappointed by the amount of DLC's that have been added because while they are really cool it makes the vanilla game seem really bland."
13653,"At this point, it should go without saying that this game is a necessity for any fan of city-building games."
13654,Its good as a sandbox game because you can make your own city.
13655,I love this game!!!
13656,i like to hurl meteors at the citizens just so the buildings go *boom*
13657,The true Sim City 5
13658,yes

13661,"Easily the best city building/managing game out there.
With tons of expansions to choose from, this game offers anything you would want from a city building game."
13662,Very addictive!
13663,Extremely addictive
13664,impressive city building sim
13665,Good Simulator
13666,nice
13667,the best city builder.  DLC's  a tad expensive if adding them all up
13668,"Wonderful game for people interested in making and designing cities, dont hold back!
Quickly get it while you can!"
13669,i love it
13670,"This is the best game ever. it is just amazing and i love to play it, definetely recommend people to buy this"
13671,its a a good game but if you want to play good workshop maps you should get the new player bundle or get the sunset harbour mass transit and industries dlc's
13672,"I didn't expect city designing to be this hard 
"
13673,yes
13674,This game is by far the very best city sim out there.
13675,"If you loved the sim city games then you will love this as well, in fact I prefer Cities: Skylinesnow."
13676,amazing
13677,Best City Builder out there love it!
13678,"it's good
"
13679,An absolute banger!
13680,yes
13681,I suck at this but I love it
13682,Best city builder out there
13683,"If you have traffic problems, destroy the road and build another. Problem solved.... Nope that's what you think. So rinse... repeat... rinse... repeat, till you get frustrated and panic build roads all over the place."
13684,"Super fun, the hard part for me most times is beginning the build because I always seem to run our of money. I always try to build too much in the beginning and it bites me in the ass. Super fun, animation is super cool and it's fun to see the stats of each area and people. Idk what else to say, super worth it if you like planning games"
13685,"The only PARADOX thing here is, that they sold me half a game for a full price.

Was done after 11 hours. Could be faster.
YES, I can micromanage the sh** out of it... but thats not content I payed for.

I understand the idea of DLC's. But this is ridiculous.
Sometimes the building menu is half empty for some categories... y?

The core game has no depth at all.
And buying the rest I will not... for 200+

Adjust your grief.

Yoda out.

"
13686,"Amazing game and if you download the dlc while on sale, such a steal"
13687,it good
13688,Skylinely
13689,"good game
"
13690,"It's alright I guess.
More like a cityscape sculpting tool than a game where you start with a small town and develop it into a megalopolis. Everything is just a cookie cutter stamping tool where you build things in huge blocks or stripes, which doesn't conform with any sort of reality. Cities aren't built that way from the start, they develop that way over a long period of time.
""I'm going to plant all of my factories in this remote area so the pollution doesn't kill all my citizens.""
When in reality factories and industrial areas are right next to commercial and residential areas, because what pollution they give off isn't some toxic cloud of deadly miasma, it's mostly confined to the site of the factory itself, or output into the air. Then again, the pollution in this game is laughable.
It leads the player to make decisions that are fundamentally inhuman in nature, and to build and develop a city based on a single pre-determined model of economic development.
You can't start off with a logging or mill town and work your way up through the ages to a big city, you can't renovate old buildings and use them for new purposes, and you can't re-develop or re-zone an area without literally tearing down every single building in it and re-building them.
It's all quite a bit ridiculous, cartoonish, and oversimplified.

But, I suppose this is still the best city-building game that has come out recently.
SimCity 4 was still better though."
13691,"is this game recommenable?

well, yes. maybe not for the price of 20 euro's, but it is a fun game for sure. it can be very challenging, frustrating and pleasing. its very indept and you can spend ours just perfecting every little detail. the vanilla game on itself might be a bit, not enough. but with the free mods that you can easily download from the steam workshop its worth it for sure."
13692,I have a love-hate relationship with this game. It's so fun but the traffic is a nightmare.
13693,Best simulation game ever. Love this.
13694,Effective treatment for hypotension
13695,I was entertained.
13696,G
13697,good
13698,"The best city builder out there. But what makes the game really stand out and makes it my propably favourtie game of all times, is the fantastic modding community"
13699,Best games
13700,"You'll be driving around in real life, stuck in traffic, and see how some city does a feeder ramp and suddenly start imagining a whole city built around that kind of feeder. Sometimes  the game crashes but overall 100000/10."
13701,its good
13702,good
13703,This is truly an amazing city builder! With the modding support and the great DLC you can build anything you want to build.
13704,"me when


bottem text



this is useless info"
13705,"First city builder i played was Sim City 2000 around the year 1999. The next city builder I played is Cities Skylines about 20 years later.... and let me tell you I felt as giddy about this game due to the nostalgia of Sim City. 

If our mayors and city planners are forced to play at least 30 hours of this game, they will probably be competent at their actual jobs. But at the same time they don't have to ability to raze the shittiest suburbs at a blink of an eye... or send down natural calamities into poorly designed areas..
"
13706,A very fun game with friends and I really liked it and was worth buying
13707,best city sim on the market
13708,"Highly recomend, not as complex as you might think, that is a GOOD thing."
13709,very good very fun makews me forgewt abouit the pain
13710,Old but gold.
13711,"This is an immersive and fulfilling game, I am enjoying the experience"
13712,"It has qualities to master, like traffic and zoning, but its lacking in visual customization."
13713,IT good
13714,why my skylines wont start?
13715,"Good city simulator, Im terrible at it."
13716,Amazing game.
13717,"really fun, if you have the money to spare well worth the price"
13718,London stab rates are very high fun fact
13719,base game is great but those dlcs are a slippity slope
13720,hhhh
13721,"Play it with mods. Get it on sale, for <$15. Atrocious amount of DLCs"
13722,"I've played across PC and xbox off and on since like...2017, and I recommend it purely because it's a fairly in-depth micromanagement game. I am terrible are writing game reviews, because what I like and don't like about ones I play tend to be the polar opposite of most everyone else."
13723,I enjoy making a city then crashing it's economy and forcing people to go homeless. 10/10 buildings
13724,"good game, I can play it hours at a time"
13725,great game for escaping reality
13726,Highly addictive.
13727,"one of the best
"
13728,Enjoyable city builder with simple mechanics that gradually get more challenging as you expand.
13729,"Pros: fun
easy to play 
good controls
easily install mods
Cons: requires a beefy pc"
13730,Very nice city building game!
13731,Could spend years on it. Best long term game ever
13732,The game is absolutely great. The vanilla experience is good and you can mod the crap out of it. The bigger dlcs are great as well and add tons of content and new stuff such as roads and public transport. Also whenever there is a bigger dlc released the game gets a free update for everyone.
13733,"A beautiful, thoughtful, fantastic and relaxing game"
13734,"I have never thought, that thinking how to make one highway (that doesne't eaven solve moest of my traffic problem) will bring me so much fun.
10/10 The best city building game"
13735,very addicting lol
13736,"yes
"
13737,GOD
13738,"Really good game with many DLCs and modding capability. You can either plan a city and build it with a system in mind or you just start and see what happens. recommended, but buy the DLCs on Sale"
13739,Great game!
13740,"best sim builder game made so far, with all DLCs even much better."
13741,Очень правдоподобный градостроительный симулятор
13742,I love it
13743,gud
13744,game good. steam give me card now?
13745,"Pretty cool sim but it could have more features for realism, like mixed zoning, cycle lanes, etc,"
13746,Warning: this game is highly addictive
13747,"Excellent game, more content would be nice
8.5/10"
13748,its a fun relaxing game
13749,Makes me angry sometimes but i cant stop playing
13750,"vary fun when bored, suggest it if you have OCD"
13751,YES
13752,nice game
13753,Just an awesome in-depth game. Fun to build little cities and see what all ya can make happen!
13754,"Amazing city builder, with content updates and features being added over the years.  Great modding community to make gam e even better."
13755,This game is super fun. It is a great strategy game. The fact that it has Workshop makes it even better.
13756,Addicting game af
13757,Great to past time with most especially after work.
13758,"Amazing game for someone who always wanted a more detailed city builder than what SIM City offered.
However, Paradoxe's way of business means that DLC content is 2x bigger than what you get in basic game. The fact that they sell entire DLC content for 200EURr is just absurd.

Things & mechanics that should be free update they found a way to monetise.

For this deplorable and shameful business practice I will not recommend the game. Greed is though the roof."
13759,Little relaxing game to waste the time away or unwind from a stressful/hectic day.
13760,e
13761,Love the traffic
13762, so fun
13763,"Played it in the past and just got bored. Attempted to come back to it and the launcher just wont download, while i like the game fine, fighting with launchers that i don't want in the first place is where i draw a line."
13764,nice game
13765,I am just starting out on this game after hearing about it for years. Absolutely love it.
13766,.
13767,"Nice

13774,Been 3 years still love this game!
13775,Crack cocaine video game.
13776,Love this game. Can easily loose myself for hours trying to build the perfect city. Strongly reccomend
13777,best of sims.
13778,"I play this every holiday, and it always has tons of content and the DLC always goes on sale around this time. Lots of community content as well."
13779,It is a fun and addictive game that tests your mind.
13780,"Let me get this straight, this game is very good and has A LOT of potential. However, charging more than $150 for complete DLC is just insane."
13781,poopy water hahaha
13782,"Simple, intuitive and modern enough that I can get to the fun sandbox part, unlike Sim City. 
Serious enough to be funny only when you want it to be, unlike Tropcio.

Overall, very polished. Good value if you can get some DLC with the base game on sale"
13783,"Cities: Skylines is not a game I would have expected to fall in love with as quickly as I have. It's one of those games that's always been on my wishlist, but it's never been one I've given very high priority to. However, once I saw the Deluxe version on sale for $10 this past week, I knew I had to buy it.

I skimmed through some reviews here on Steam before doing so, and saw how several people mentioned that this game is one that you will sink tons of hours into without realizing. Now, I'm not someone who has the most time or attention span to spend on one game at a time, so I expected that I would play it for 30-45 minutes at a time and move on. But boy was I wrong when I started getting into this game.

I started by activating the infinite money cheat just to get to grips with how several of the game's mechanics work (and because I tend to prefer the more sandbox/freeplay style). I began with the first map and got to work. I was absolutely hooked immediately. From building roads, zoning buildings, placing special buildings, and everything else. I have become so heavily invested in my first town now that I've already spent all of my playtime just on it (13 hours at the time of writing). I've already developed such an emotional attachment to what I've built, because even though I have an endless supply of money, it feels like I put hard work into it. And I think that's what this game does so well. 

While I may have played this for a relatively short time, it has been a blast. So much so, that I'm leaving this Steam review much earlier in its playtime than I usually would. I don't usually review games this early on, but not many manage to keep my attention like this. It's been so long since a game has made me lose track of time (which this one has twice now). 

While I love this game a ton already, I would not recommend this game if sandbox games are not your style. Really though, I feel this game is very accessible to most people and I think it's one you should definitely have in your library. Overall, I highly recommend this game, whether you are into Paradox's other map-based strategy games like Hearts of Iron, Stellaris, or Europa Universalis; or you were a fan of the Sim City games, or you just enjoy building any kind of city you want."
13784,more mods plz
13785,very nice game. I'm enjoying this game and kill my times lol.
13786,Best time sink out there
13787,"Better than expected

Usually when i think of building sim games, i think of those cheesy mobile games that are pretty much play to win.  I gave up on city sim games, and thought city skylines was going to be the same way. But the positive reviews made me want to check this game out. And all the reviews where right, this is by far the most addicting game ive played in a while. What makes this game so good is the endless mods you can apply to the game, and all these mods are free!!!. Also city skylines seems much more realistic than other sims I've played. 
"
13788,yes
13789,I enjoy this game on pc more than the switch. But it is my go to game on the switch so I have to say I like it.
13790,Fun concept. Smooth animations.

"
13799,good
13800,"Cities: Skylines has saved the city simulation game niche.  I work in architecture and love city planning.  This game gives such a unique command of transportation and varied specialty approaches.  Still needs to explore mixed use zoning and other things, but so solid."
13801,"i mean its alright, underrated as fuck in my option, but its alright"
13802,Amazing game. Wonderful graphics. Great overall game.
13803,IZ GOOOOOOOOD!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! BUY IT!!!
13804,I have put so many hours into this game. Absolutely loved every second and love to build my huge cities. Lots of fun.
13805,build
13806,"Love this game, some of the stuff is a little buggy and it can get laggy too, but it is genuinely so fun and addictive that it's worth the few quirks 100%"
13807,Addictive.
13808,cool
13809,"Excellent mod support, and very active modding community. Because of this I would say this is the best city building game available."
13810,"What I liked about this game is that, compared to other Paradox games I've played, I feel that the micro-management is more easily digestible and easy to understand. Essentially the game, at it's most basic level, is responding to your citizens needs at push of of button. It gives you an almost instant gratification that what you're doing is actually, well, DOING something."
13811,Took it to a level SimCity could only dream of. Highly recommended to anyone who liked the genre
13812,Best City builder game. everything SimCity should have been!
13813,"this game, it sucks me in, keeps me coming back for more"
13814,its great time wasting activity
13815,Simply put : the best city builder ever created. A must have in the genre.
13816,"Very fun and detailed game, and mods make it even better."
13817,you can download mc.donalds
13818,"This game is highly addictive. I can easily spend an entire day, non-stop playing this game. It has a good balance of being strategic while being open for creativity."
13819,Very fun game. Lots of realism
13820,"Great game, but I can't play it without mods."
13821,Best city builder made. DLC's can be worth it just do a little research before buying em.

13840,good game
13841,"Only in this game can you make a poo volcano and remove the walls, flooding your city with crap"
13842,city build fun yes
13843,good game in general and probably buy the disastors dlc for the game so you can rain meators down on your city. this game is poggers.
13844,Very addictive game to play if you enjoy being mayor and the responsibility.
13845,"its fun :)
"
13846,It's easy to lose track of reality while getting sucked into this game. That is both a pro and a con.
13847,good.
13848,"This is a fantastic game that pushes your creativity, has a difficult learning curve to get things right, has a litterally infinite amount of modders and mods to augment your play and ends up with you knowing the game is badly coded so you can basically never truly win or step out of one ""right"" formula. By this time however, you'd probably have played at least 60 hours or more."
13849,"As a longtime Sim City fan, having played the original on the Mighty and Immortal Commodore 64, the horribleness of the last Sim City sat incredibly poorly with me. Thankfully, Cities Skylines came along, and while it isn't a direct replacement, it's still a far more worthy successor than the last Sim City. 

To start, it's a very complex game. With a ton of DLC expanding that complexity. So don't go in looking for an short play time. This in turn means the UI is a bit obtuse. It can be hard to figure out what exactly is going on at times, and to actually fix the problem even once you do figure it out. However, that's not really a bad thing. 

Probably the most annoying is not having access to everything from the start. Want a post office? Nope, got to hit x milestone first. Same for police, schools, most road configurations, etc... The laying out of roads is also clunky, especially when trying to freehand, and one way streets is completely annoying the way you have to remove them to change direction. Again, it may not detract from the game, but it does annoy me particularly. 

It does lack the charm and humor of the best sim City, Sim City 2000, which has had a permanent spot on my computers since it was released. 

All in all, it's more than a worthy replacement for the ruins of Sim City. However, if you're looking for that classic Sim City 2000 feel... this isn't it."
13850,hhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh
13851,one of the most complex city building game I've ever played
13852,The best city building simulator!
13853,"As an enthusiastic player of Sim City 4 back in the day, this scratches the itch and then some. There is little I can say that hasn't been said a million times elsewhere. My only regret is not buying more RAM."
13854,"Build city, watch it grow, get confuse the traffic suck"
13855,architect wanna be
13856,Amazing
13857,mungkin walikota ama gurbernur belajar bikin kota dari game ini
13858,"8/10 Rellay good game, great workshop and dlc."
13859,Bag pua gua lui
13860,This is the best city planner game I have ever played
13861,"The ultimate city building game, backed up by a universe of mods, assets and online tutorial and player videos."
13862,Yeah it's good 👍
13863,Build City. Traffic. Fun.
13864,"Great game, very fun. Would like some optimisation for Mac though."
13865,Fun
13866,yes
13867,"I love this game a lot, but I can never have enough computer resources to run this game smoothly with so many mods and DLC installed"
13868,"Excellent game, a flawless simulation of Los Angeles drivers."
13869,a very good and fun game. I like that you can use Mods made by the community and that you can create your own maps
13870,Better than SimCity
13871,"I always come back to Cities Skylines, after many years and playing so many games, this one holds to be my favourite"
13872,Amazing game! Game is very stable with heavy mods enabled! Highly recommend!
13873,Outstanding game!
13874,It is a very fun game for people who like to be able to build a city and do what they want with it.
13875,"Best city builder I've ever played. It's so light that I can play it on an 11 year old business laptop with an i5 4700M and a Radeon HD 8790 mobile series graphics, as long as I cut most of the mods out. Two thumbs up! Thanks to all the modders that help keep this game fresh and exciting."
13876,Interface is great. Mechanics underneath seem to run better than Sim City.
13877,Very fun but can be laggy with bad PC
13878,Its fun I guess
13879,Good game.
13880,fun game and realistic
13881,I enjoy the game and all the different Cities you can make.
13882,City
13883,"Very good game. If you are going to buy this game while it is 30 dollars, wait because it goes on sale often and the same thing with the dlcs. just be careful to not install to many mods because it can take up a lot of memory if you do and cause the game to crash. also use autosave incase the game crashes. I do think it is stupid how many very things in the game like the lane connector are locked behind mods and you cant get them on console"
13884,I like this game
13885,"Love this game, its fun and relaxing to play."
13886,Almost 500 hours and I keep coming back. 'nuff said? ;)
13887,"Very enjoyable game, even in its vanilla settings.  Gets even better with DLCs."
13888,Good
13889,Very good mechanics + active mod community
13890,Its a good time. Lot of systems to learn.
13891,hours and hours and hours of entertainment
13892,yes
13893,"The best and most detailed city builder game i've ever played.
i like this game so much that even i played it cracked still i purchased it full dlc.
but u have to like the genre."
13894,"One of those “fXXk its 4am” games. Highly immersive, highly detailed, highly demanding but highly rewarding city building. You think you’ll be bored and turn it off soon and then another 3 hours goes by. I recommend the 81 squares mod for those looking to create a megalopolis rather than a bunch of medium cities on different maps. Don’t forget to get your achievements first though as they'll become locked"

13906,"Very fun and creative!
The base product is great. DLCs make it better.
highly recommend"
13907,A+ 10/10
13908,"Mesmerizing detail and gameplay features. It's so much more dynamic than other city simulators and generally I'm able to bypass a lot of detailed management if I wish to, which is a huge plus as an infrequent game player sometimes."
13909,"best city sim ever made, just get it"
13910,I Like this game alot and try not get carryed away with buying the DLC's i am very addicted to this game now lol!
13911,"mmmmmmmmmmmmmyes
This game is fun, DLCs are overpriced as hell but that is compensated for by the highly active workshop community"
13912,.
13913,Good game
13914,"I keep coming back to it, had it on xbox game pass, bought a pc partially because of this game and being able to mod. thanks modders and Paradox"

13931,Great
13932,"Great game, love burning my laptop with hundreds of mods, and thousands of assets :)"
13933,woot woot

13945,love this game
13946,fun to play great game detail
13947,"what a game! It's very entertaining, but the quality I appreciate most is the beauty of the graphics. thanks Colossal Order!
Highly recommended for times when you want to disconnect from reality in a smart way."
13948,"Gud Game. 11/10 worthy to loose about 3000 hours of ur life if ya want to. Attention! teaches u unhealthy perfectionism through game mechanics that include micro-mircomanaging like in no other game.
Play it with modes to lose your mind."
13949,Addicting city builder with endless content and mods.
13950,Chillin´ and buldin´
13951,"The game is so great! It entirely works like a real city.
The game is well worth the price of CNY 22"
13952,"Great game with loads of content and mods to keep the game fun. New DLC's are a big reason why I'm still playing this game after so many years. I wouldn't recommend buying them for the full price though, they are quite expensive. Just wait for a sale where most of them are 50% off."
13953,Wanted this game for long time and got it. It's creative and fun to make own city 🙂
13954,Calm and relaxing
13955,200€ for DLCs? No thanks.
13956,damn this game is good
13957,very pog
13958,Gud
13959,Haha meteor strike go brrrrr
13960,good game but you gotta pay for basic DLC shit
13961,beatiful game
13962,amazing city builder
13963,"Yes
and
Yes"
13964,"The base game is fairly ok, but it needs mods to really shine. Performance wise it's quite CPU intensive, and the more workshop assets you enable, the worse the lag will get, and as such it's in dire need of a good refactoring. I think the company will likely scratch it and make cities:skylines 2, rather than investing a ton of resources on this game's likely bloated codebase.
The bottom line is that you need a high-end computer,  and a good number of mods and workshop assets. 
You may also want a few DLCs which add a lot of additional gameplay options. IMHO these ""priority"" DLCs are:
* After dark
* Sunset harbor
* Industries
* Park Life
* Mass Transit

There are also some content-creator packs which (ironically) are much cooler (and useful) than paradox-made DLCs. For example, the content creator pack ""Train Stations"" gives you more options to create efficient and gorgeous train and metro hubs by adding train stations with 4 platforms and metro hubs which can handle 5 different lines"
13965,Best city building game out there and the Mods for the PC version turn this into almost the perfect city simulator. A must have for those that love sims.
13966,"Best buider game I've played. However, I wish AI's behaviors are improved."
13967,dont get alot of mods (im trying to get mods and it just crashed my game)
13968,"One of the best city building games on Steam and well worth your money just for the base game on it's own. 

If you enjoy this type of game play it would be wise to invest in some essential DLC packs when they are discounted during steam sale events! I am also looking forward to the new instalment of this title in the near future and I hope that the developer keeps the same winning formula and continues supporting as well as encouraging one of the largest modding communities currently in the Steam Workshop eco systems. 

The game has a huge following and amazing content creation community, one of the best on Steam hands down."
13969,"Love playing this game. Took me a little bit to learn the different functions, as there isn't a full tutorial, but once you get your head around things, the DLC and custom content is fantastic!"

13978,"Built city, then destroyed it with a meteor"
13979,you make cities 10/10
13980,"I've spent too much time ""relaxing"" from medical school by studying city planning reports and urban development. If you don't want to continuously critique your real life, home town's, endless construction projects with your own solutions, then this isn't the game for you. Seriously considering dropping out of university and applying to the local municipality and give them some tips on how they should proceed with the expansion of our infrastructure. Stress relief? 3/10. Enjoyment? 8/10. The realization that Cities: Skylines has over-taken every waking thought and is now prioritized as the reason I wake up in the morning? 11/10."
13981,"Great game! Mechanics are awesome, and although it isn't a perfect simulation of a real city it's pretty darn close! Would totally recommend this game for those who like building and management!"
13982,"No time to review, just check my citizens tweets.."

13986,ITS SO FUN IM TELLING YOU GETIT GETIT GETIT (its 30$ by the way)
13987,I love this game! I always build little towns and watch the people do stuff that people do in the real world! It's a great place to release your toughs in your mind and be creative. I love this game and thank it should be in the top 3 best game's IN THE WORLD! :>
13988,I had 2 assignments due but decided that getting a city to 40k population was more important
13989,fun
13990,"i love i love i love i build city i love, you would be surprised at how fun this genre of games is."
13991,Great Game Better If You Play With Mods
13992,still stressful but pretty good
13993,"wow

13994,Like crack but more addicting
13995,good game mods make it better
13996,fun :)
13997,"Good game, but I don't know why for me the game is laggy and hard to control sometimes. Loading takes some time, but when I get in the game the real fun starts. I can play no problem, but when I have to save or leave, horrible. I don't know why, is anyone else also experiencing this problem? 7,5/10 Good for when you like simulation games and like building cities."

Great mod content and DLC packages."

14015,"Cities: Skylines is easely the most relaxing game in my library. Have a few hours ypu need to kill? This is the game for you! 

The game is easy to learn, visualy stunning and you can always find new ways to improve your gameplay or expand and repair your city. This game also has some great DLC's for when you feel you whant to change things up."

14039,"This is the best game i've ever played. Usually i played football games, but Cities Skylines made me stop playing those game. Now i am totally hooked to this. I am so addicted to this game. It makes me rage my brain to be more creative. Also it made me pays careful attention to my cities that i've been just to look for an inspiration. Best of the best. Congrats!!!"

14063,I liked the added disasters DLC.
14064,Clearly I like this game.
14065,"Easily one of the best city management games to ever be made. Simcity would smile in reverence at this games fantastic, addictive way of making you play for just one more hour that turns into 3 or 4 or even more hours. Tons of mods from the dev and plenty of community made mods and asserts on the workshop ensure there is always something new to spice up your city. Good luck on making your city perfect, Mayor."
14066,fun game

14069,Best city sim on the market. Expansions add some variety and depth.
14070,good game
14071,"Continued Support. 
Amazing workshop community.
Sandbox of the year and continuing.
Will always have your attention.
Love and hate relationship.

One on-going issue: Not enough base game support to help with assets. 
Mods need another to help function at times, next thing you know you added 100+ assets, and 10+ mods to your game.
This game is amazing for truthfully creating your own world. Asset and continued mod support for the base game would be outstanding. Unfortunately, the base isn't build to handle over 500+ assets. (Once you visit the Workshop you'll understand.) Your FPS will drop drastically. There are mods out there to assist however, but unsure if it's enough. Only con I would ever express with Cities Skylines. 

Need a challenge? 
Need to relax?
Want a different pace in life? 
Architect?

This game offers different paces for your personality. I recommend this game to anyone who has a mind for creativity even when you don't think you have any."
14072,"Fantastic game that you can spend hours in, tweaking and molding your city into perfection."
14073,"Build, erase, build again, erase again. Fun, time consuming, did I say FUN?? BUT! Traffic.... the traffic, oh lord :D Good luck"
14074,"I've created an city so big my PC needs 16GB of ram just to load it, very gut."
14075,"Better than Simcity 5

Parklife & Industries is the two best DLC"
14076,mods make it playable - traffic is terrible
14077,"Whether you wish to build your dream city, master the flow of traffic or recreate landmarks, you will first spend a lot of time figuring out how to start your city properly and building efficient interchanges. I would recommend playing vanilla for a while before looking at mods. It is good to see the limitations of the game first hand and then learn how certain mods address them."
14078,"Flooding an entire city by accident and watching every citizen you love disappear and die due to disease from not investing enough in healthcare or the water system? Check!

Love this game."
14079,"This game just won't die. It is good enough with the base game, but the expansion packs are often on sale and there's a never-ending supply of workshop content. There isn't an 'endgame' where your arcos take off in to space, either, so you just keep on playing (and getting increasingly irritated with managing your traffic...)"
14080,It's just really fun. In a  good way!
14081,Best city builder ever made. Workshop support is incredible.
14082,"its okay to say the lest
its a bit expensive"
14083,being president simulator :D
14084,"A lot of fun, really absorbs you"
14085,joo hyvä peli
14086,"Vanilla - Simple for beginners but does allow more advanced players to show off their skill. Its not boring and will easily give you at least 50 hours of in game time. Just to complete one city or scenario. You can create most things you would imagine being in city building games with a few exceptions. They're not major or anything, just quality of life like road or prop collisions. It has some nice DLC but it's pretty expensive.
Modded - Hard to find the perfect mods but once you do it is quite remarkable."
14087,Pretty good
14088,Great city builder. Better than SC4.
14089,"very addicting, super detailed, and loads of fun!"
14090,The level of detail in the gameplay and graphics is unreal. Totally immersive game.
14091,Fell in love after second approach. The complexity and beauty of this game take a while to understand.
14092,👍
14093,"I never thought I would play this game. It was daunting at start tbh, But as I found nothing else to tickle my fancy, this game really surprised me so good I was once dreaming to make content on YT. I'm still stuck with a 9-5 job and I cant find time as a young dad to make content for this game, this game will be forever be installed in my pc and for the newer versions to come. Thank you for the Autumn sale, I am now going to purchase the full content because think I've already saved enough for now."
14094,"a great time killer, for those who tired of competitive games.
but like any other competitive games, had the same problem, trash always a huge pain in the a*s.
experience wise, great, but like many other stated problems, for the game to become more interesting u have to smack the money to the developers's a*s. cost a bunch, some of them great, choose wisely like u would choose your third wife."
14095,"Buy if you like video game
"
14096,Excellent city based sim game
14097,👍👍👍
14098,external cargo railways and airlines never import crates. i have no idea why
14099,Take some time to learn...
14100,"good game, what can I say? Better than sim city."
14101,Getting back in to this one after stepping away for a long time. Still as addicting as ever!
14102,"This game never gets old. If you need a sign to buy C:S, this is it."
14103,"Easy to get addicted, feels impossible to master. Doesn't stop me from trying! I like to think I get a little better each time."
14104,It is by far the best city building game out there
14105,very good game!
14106,its hard its a grind and my city looks poop
14107,The best game ever
14108,This is a dream come true for me too purchase and play this game. it's a bit laggy for my laptop but still playable. i still need many hours deep into this game to get used to it but still very enjoyable. I'll be playing it later during my sem break so that i could really understand how to play this. kinda sad its laggy for me but that is my problem and has nothing to do with the game. i hope la. recommend. and OH thanks for the free dlc ahahhahaha
14109,"The base game here is very good and can be improved greatly by the extensive mod support and Steam workshop integration.

The DLC is another story. A lot of it is very good and can enhance your experience. A lot of it is bloat. The park, industries, and campus DLCs are VERY similar to each other but all have their own quirks. You don't need any DLC at all to enjoy the game but if you do want some of it, you should do some researching as to whether you would actually want it."
14110,"It has been more than 3 years playin this awesome game, and feel like bought for the first time"
14111,still the best city builder
14112,SimCity? What's that.
14113,Best City building game. Period.
14114,More buggy ****
14115,"It's a city transit network simulator first but its mostly played for its city painting features. The city simulation aspect is shallow and lacking when compared to Simcity 4. Many desirable and needed features are locked behind paid DLCs that fix the base game.

In my experience you need 12GB of RAM memory minimum to play with DLC comfortably."
14116,The game itself is a good game but it's incredibly hard to learn when first starting out.
14117,Relax game
14118,City dies due to traffic!!!
14119,Great game.
14120,I just like it
14121,"stress reliever, sometimes"
14122,"I spend my time for playing this game. All aspect from my wish;
Public Transport (Yes); District Area (Yes); Terrain (Yes); Underground Road (Yes)
AI Civilians (Yes); Mod (Absolutely Yes)
Too much wishes in this game is COMPLETELY TRUE."
14123,Very good game to play and relax.
14124,"what simcity always wanted to be, but never managed"
14125,The proper successor to SimCity. Such a damn good game.
14126,good game
14127,I made a city worse than Africa and the third world countries. LULE
14128,"This game is very addictive!!!
First thing I do when I open my PC is playing this amazing game...
What's not amazing is my RAM :-( 
Hoping to increase my RAM so that I can take advantage of the mods... Or maybe the developers will make an update to make the game more enjoyable even with low specs.. That would be great."
14129,"it is a great game 
But you do get bored of it after a bit of playing it"
14130,Cities: Skylines its the best City Building Simulation at least for me 😍
14131,Fun
14132,Is good
14133,Cities: Skylines is the current front runner for city builders. I go to bed thinking about infrastructure. 10/10
14134,I like it.
14135,Traffic Management Simulator 2020 :D
14136,yes
14137,"Not very nais

14140,good
14141,"Love it, it's so detailed and moddable. Every little guy has a life, and you can really screw them over :D"
14142,"One of the worlds was glitched. My computer ended up being useless because the game was in full screen mode and it wasnt responding, i'm not much of a computer guy so i just left it run overnight. I come back from school the next day and it still has not loaded, i press a bunch of stuff and am somehow able to close the game. I did try it later with another map which ended up being wayyy too laggy to be playable even on the lowest everything in the settings. I guess my computer is not made for games. My issue now is that I am not able to receive a refund because i let the game run overnight. in terms of play time i probably have about an hour and a half but the loading issue i experienced added another 18 ish. I really hope someone can help with this. I did submit another claim which I hope will be accepted."
14143,"If you're looking for a city building game, this is it. This is the best city building game out there in the market rn"
14144,It's the best city builder game out there hands down. :D
14145,ːsteamthumbsupː
14146,"build road, life good. ROAD FILLS WITH TRAFFIC, DEMOLISH ROAD. road gone :(
think about road
regret );"
14147,ok
14148,build small town and then watch it burn.
14149,Comfy city builder with altogether too much dlc that the base game really needs as per paradox mandate. Still comfy though
14150,If you like simulators this game will consume a lot of your time and you will love it.
14151,Excellent game is excellent
14152,great game
14153,its the city builder game. its basically perfect
14154,mayor build city))

14164,"You'll be driving around in real life, stuck in traffic, and see how some city does a feeder ramp and suddenly start imagining a whole city built around that kind of feeder."
14165,Fun if you tried games like SimCity or Like building cities of mom
14166,Nice game for simulator model
14167,"Nice
"
14168,W game
14169,"IMO the best city building game out there, nothing compares. Every dollar I've spent on it or DLCs brought me joy :')"
14170,Amazing
14171,"I miss Sim City Franchise, but this game has done an excellent job of replacing one of my favorite games."
14172,The SimCity we deserve
14173,"Great city builder, with quantum of content (dlcs are not necessary, but they add a lot in specific direction of interest, for example industry, university, parks, taffic....). The game has a strong player base and so there is a lot of workshop stuff. It is chilling and challenging at the same time (and funny too, if you listen to in-game radio. Cannot other than strongly reccoment if you like city builders with strategic elements."
14174,It's wonderful game
14175,Hoping you would release a new version. Feels kinda dated to me but still awesome!!
14176,This game cures my boredom of playing other games.
14177,Great city sim with lots of expansions and mod support also the game looks really good.
14178,By far the best way to waste 4 hours in one hour
14179,yes
14180,"very old game and it shows, price is high and lots of things locked behind pay wall, even if you buy everything the game is still very old and you wont be happy."
14181,Still one of the best city builders out there.
14182,Sim City
14183,"You can rebuild Medieval Paris, cool game"

14189,i guess its cool
14190,Its a good game
14191,This still remains my go to game!   it is just fun to try new things after watching a Biffa video!
14192,best sand box city building game ever!
14193,play this game with mods makes the game way better but its still pretty good without them do research before you buy tho
14194,More time spent on workshop than ingame
14195,best city building games
14196,This can game can pass your day by just adjusting traffic and building new road
14197,"Years old, but still a great game to get into"
14198,good game
14199,Wonderful game. I enjoy it up until my city turns into a traffic management simulator for people with NASA-spec computers.
14200,I never get bored of this game. Love everything about it.
14201,"its so good because you have dlcs more stuff like the brides and piers thats my fav dlc sbut  its hard to learn how to 
"
14202,"One of the best games i've ever seen by now, Absolutely fantastic! 95/100!"
14203,good
14204,"Bugs, Bad assets' management with mods, unbalanced for some DLCs, unexplained rules, missing guidelines to solve problems...
Not recommended."
14205,"its good for who want be a good city planner,
use this for study how make a good city"
14206,"Honestly this a such a fun game. My only complaint is that I feel like beginners have to go out of their way to learn how to plan good cities. Once you get past being initially overwhelmed, though, this game is hard to put down!"
14207,awesome game in sand-play mode
14208,"I recommend it if you are into city builders.  The workshop content can add a whole new level of depth to whatever it is you are trying to create as well.  I'd say most/all of the DLC is worth it, especially if you can grab it on sale."
14209,Buggy garbage with bad DLC policy. Avoid.
14210,yah
14211,"reminds me a lot of the good old times in simcity 2000, but better in every modern ways"

14213,pretty tits
14214,"Love this game, very addicting.  The ability to mod and create assets really sets this game apart from other city building games."
14215,.
14216,All sorts of real world problems and opportunities.   A truly great game.  Goes to the next level from Sim City
14217,"I would most certainly recommend this for a building game. The only problem I have with this is that the street's are too tight, but I have that issue solved via the Node Controler Renewal mod."
14218,"The game has crashed twice in the last 24 hours. I've played it about 15 hours I think. I got some mods last nite and spent a LOT of money placing bridges and highways and the game crashed and even though it's set to save every 10 minutes, it didn't. I would not recommend this game due to the errors in the game, like roads and buildings I didn't put there, the crashing and the lack of customer support."
14219,"Fun game,, gives you the basics of archetechture and city design. Would recommend"
14220,"Cities is a game that keeps giving and if that keeps happening, I`m gonna keep playing"
14221,it is by far the best city planning game because it has many features that sim city for exemple don't have
14222,"cool city building game, get natural disaster dlc by the way it's good"
14223,good city building game
14224,good
14225,"The game is really good. If you like games like Sim City then this is the game for you. With the addition of DLCs this game gets a solid 9/10 from me. I have spent hours watching my sims go about there normal day yo day life. It is also nice to solve traffic issues and places down train or bus routes. If you like Trains, Planes, Cars, Trams or Metros this game has it for you. I 100% recommend you get it. I would also say pick up all of the DLCs as they are all good and worth buying. Sorry for the long post."

14227,vedy god
14228,"Tried this game for 30 minutes but hated it: there was no tutorial and I really did not understand what was expected. 
The ""24 hour play time"" does not reflect my actual usage of Skylines: I was stuck in the menu..."
14229,good
14230,"Gefühlt 75% des Spiels ist hinter den 200€ an DLCs versteckt
"
14231,.
14232,Yeah it's good.
14233,"Very fun game, I have played countless hours offline the steam workshop paired with the DLC's makes the game so much better."
14234,"City skylines is a terrific game for people who are looking for a city simulation game with a touch more realism than the sims city game(s). At this point in the games development life cycle there are some small roadblocks as far as content is concerned so you more or less have to purchase the DLC if you want more than just the basic maps and items that come with it. But even then I have put a lot of time (off steam) into the game and been fine. 

some of the community made mods through the workshop are amazing and really help to make the game more fun, and challenging friends to see who can build a better city in a short amount of time can help to bring more challenge back into the game. all in all this a fun game."
14235,"The AI is so inexcusably bad, it ruins the immersion of building a sprawling city after end game (megalopolis). Traffic becomes so bad and spawn times are too fast that the game itself can't keep up. It comes to a point where you NEED mods in order to fix it, and even then, it get's worse as the AI is mostly incompatible with the mods as the coding of the game conflicts with the mods coding, thus rendering the traffic a cancer to your game-play, literally growing so big to the point it kills your city slowly, much like actual cancer. Fix the traffic AI; I've seen and heard many rumors as to why you coded the way it is, and it's just lazy and rude. Assuming the majority of your player base's computers can not run the ""sophisticated AI"" required to get semi-accurate traffic is highly disrespectful and to assume anyone would keep playing the game for thousands of hours if you aren't a content creator of Biffa is insane. There are mods that add ""advanced AI' to traffic and it works pretty well, until your games coding starts to conflict with it and preform over 9k actions in a single game tick. The amount of traffic that spawns is also ridiculous as the game calls for too many actions in a short amount of time, resulting in an unnecessarily, exceedingly large amount of congestion. If the main goal was to go for realism so the game seemed more populous with 70k people, then you kinda missed the mark as it seems like the game is just spamming NPCs in order to get me to stop playing, like some weird way of telling me that I've reached end game and this is it. It makes it impossible to play with any DLC as most of my time has gone into trying to fix the traffic to make sure it isn't grid locked to the point where it doesn't function and I inevitably lose because the game just flat out stopped working due top poor game coding. Anyways, I know it's been a while since you guys released content so the chances of any devs of CMs seeing this is pretty slim. Thx for letting me vent Steam Reviews! <3"
14236,Cool
14237,For all those who are Over Thinkers out there this game will keep you busy for very long time...
14238,My most played steam game. 10/10 with mods
14239,"Had a blast over all and I do recommend this game to those who are into city builder games. However, devs are heavily inspired by EA that they even split one game into different dlcs just to make you spend more money. If you do plan to get the dlcs, do some research and decide on the ones that are worth it."
14240,One of the best in city building.
14241,Very Nice
14242,good game
14243,placing dumps and nuclear power plants next to neighborhoods makes for a great mix!
14244,traffic manager simulator
14245,The traffic does not seem simulated very well. I constantly see trucks driving through each other in intersections.
14246,goog game
14247,"Ever been stuck in traffic and think to yourself ""I could design a better street system than this"". - play this game until you realize you can't. 
9/10/. -1 point for making me buy specialized industrialization."

14249,"HOW IS THIS AI MAKING SUCH FUNNY STUFF AS THE FEW POSSIBLE BECOME NANCY WALKERS? And WHY NOT EVEN JUST ADD NEW AND NEW MOST POPULAR ARTICLES TO THE BACKPACK?

14253,"Love city sims, and this one takes everything to the next level."
14254,"Do you never go outside? Do you like wasting time? Do you like making the 4GB of ram on your computer cry because you have 500,000,000 mods installed? This game is for you."
14255,This game cures depression
14256,A bit more complex than Simcity.
14257,"Cities Skylines. Fun and dynamic game. 

PROS: The game has a lot of diversity to it. There is a lot of things you need to focus on and plan ahead for depending on what type of player you are. The steam workshop is SWEET for players looking for just about anything (specific buildings/roads/parks, mods, services, LUTs, etc.). I enjoy the fact that you can get REALLY specific and maximize your perfection in the game (if you choose to). This game can cater to a lot of different playing styles which is always nice. One map you can make beautiful, and another you can create pure chaos. 

CONS: I wish that the game offered cheaper expansions. There is a lot of extras that would be nice to have in the game, but you'll look at paying $15-30 extra for different in game experiences from the developers (after dark mode, parks/amusement, transportation, etc.). These costs stack up quick if you really enjoy the game and want to expand  your capabilities. Additionally, quite a bit of the steam workshop depends on what expansion pack you have (in order to use some of the downloads) which can be annoying at times.

OVERALL: Cities Skylines is a fun and unique game with a TON to offer. There is a lot to offer for just about any type of player. The steam workshop can boost your creativity if you have been playing for a while and need some ways to improve your game experience."
14258,citu sku;lomems
14259,"Interesting game, with a huge database on the workshop and a true community when help is needed.
Nice improvements on the graphic side and various experiences possible: detailing first or simulation first, with all intermediate between those two"
14260,Worth it
14261,Fun city builder
14262,Fun times
14263,"This is an amazing game.
I learnt lot of management here."
14264,"Very good game, just missing controller support 
"
14265,"the best city builder /sim out there. certainly needs mods though to be playable without frustration (tools and visuals are otherwise pretty limited).  luckily one of the best modding communities on steam, with good mod integration :) 
Sadly, like all pdx games, the DLC are sometimes a mixed bag of what you get for their price."
14266,you are free to do what you want
14267,BEST CITY BUILDER
14268,Love it.
14269,"If you are an aspiring city planner, I highly recommend this game. It is like a high-powered city building simulator. 9/10 Very good!"
14270,This is actually a very fun and intriguing game. I need to not say more.
14271,What SimCity should have been
14272,Fun casual relaxing.
14273,"Lots to learn, lots to do. The Learning curve on this game is higher then other simpler sims.  Lucky for YouTube and Biffa!"
14274,I'm not good at reviews - I enjoy it - it's good brain food.
14275,yes
14276,"City Management in this game is outstandingly fun, from navigating traffic junctions, and making the LARGEST populated city you can handle, it really puts your planning skills to the test, plus its super fun!"
14277,good
14278,.
14279,spend all of your money on cities: skylines
14280,"Fun intriguing game. At first I thought it was a casual city building game, but it almost feels like a RTS game with only resource managing to do.  Took me about 3 tries (30 minutes) to build a city that doesn't die off from lack of electricity and contamination.  But after you figure out how to manage resources, there's not much to do other than just expand, repeat, and make more money.  I think you will much enjoy this game if you are going for more creative aspect, such as making the most beautiful cities by using landscape function and putting up decoration and such. But if you are going for ""lets make the biggest cities ever"", there's not much fun to it since best way to do that is copy-paste each block of city."
14281,good game
14282,this game is BIG YES
14283,The game did a recent update out of nowhere and now the game doesn't load at all and keeps failing. How do I fix this problem?
14284,908yi67
14285,Good Game
14286,man this seems like a good game at first but you have to put way too many of everything to run your city its not realistic atall too many government buildings required too many busses too many garbage trucks too many creamatoriums too many roads and traffic just cant make a large pretty city without 80-95% being govrernment owned
14287,mods fix the game so now its a lot better

14290,Addictive...
14291,Good fun
14292,"Cool game, I recommend it.

If you want to enjoy more I recommend using mods."
14293,Absolutely love this game never gets old to me.
14294,"Spend some money, construct roads, install water pipes, build generators, and spend even more money, only to overspend and expenses skyrocket. Rookie mistake *cries*. But that's only half the fun, learning along the way. Find out that [i]too much[/i] intersections with traffic lights (you probably don't know where to fix them) will screw with your city, and that you won't care if there are offices near a landfill site or that a cemetery is right in front of the central hospital.

Buying this game means investing your time to build your ideal city. Even if you don't have a plan, you're gonna imagine one soon enough. Sure, you could lose track of time or stress over perfecting highways and districts with unreasonable policies (because you forgot to click on a district), but it's rewarding seeing the city grow into something beautiful. Trust me. [i][b]Satisfying[/b][/i]

You're a god here. A god who may or may not have watched tutorials to grow a city..... BUT, a god who also bores people with future plans and projects they think you're doing in real life. It's ok, mate. They don't have to know. You're good enough here in the internet."
14295,best city simulation game ever
14296,Nice relaxing game
14297,"Great game, good base but mods are needed- luckily there is a great modding community and tons of custom assets."
14298,"Overall Review- 250 hours on record so let me tell you, its a fun game. The mods make everything better! Once you get a big city, it does impact performance. Even on high end, I have to turn down settings

But i watch in the youtubers like Biffa not error. Why?
I think my friends who play this game can also help me. I hope so."
14306,"Its not bad... for a few hours, but quickly gets boring."
14307,good gam
14308,guys just buy water from the store and you don't need a proper sewage system with power!
14309,best city simulation game on the market
14310,its good
14311,yummy
14312,there are ups and downs to this game the up side is that you can have unlimited money the down side is you can't get all the roads
14313,love the assets you can add to the game

14319,It's a very good game.
14320,"Brilliant game, i love it so much. would always recommend to a city building/planning kind of person."
14321,"one of the best city building simulation games around, blows simcity away"
14322,Gud Gam
14323,yes
14324,so good
14325,:)
14326,It's fun!  It's like an updated SimCity.
14327,muy bien game! very fun yes
14328,"very good game, love it"
14329,"Evening, though Cities Skylines is a great game, won't undermind that, all DLC and all make a for an incredibly attractive package for a city builder game. Meaning the best you can find.

After that there are 2 pain points that stop me from contine gaming:

1- incompatibility with Linux. EDIT.... FROM ""Though the main game is compatible that doesn't mean the rest of the Mods you add are. Typically having a linux system: TPME plugin isn't compatible linux (freeze at start of game)"" TO the game has become quite more stable with Linux now since the Airport release. I do not see no instabilities any more, which is refreshing.
2- Worse transport simulation layer available ever. I am a fond Transporter Tycoon v2 and OpenTTD and can tell you this game is really bad in comparison. But now you even have contenders like Transport Fever 2. To recap the thing that makes me hate this game? the incapacity to fix a broken bus-tram line. It just doesn't work. A shame!!! EDIT ADD ""that has sadly not changed. If your goal is in this game to have fun optimizing transportation, just forget about it. I NEVER can edit correctly and easily a public transportation line without bringing havoc on my city... I am a major fan of Transport Fever 2 in recent times, that is such a joy in editing in existing lines""

Meanwhile I play Transport Fever2 and am happy. EDIT ""That remains true"""
14330,Grreat gaem
14331,Been playing this for more than 3 years. Still awesome to this days
14332,i reccomend as long as ur pc isnt like mine (1 fps)
14333,Best city builder simulation at there! Miles better than its competitor Sim City. A Grand Strategy mixed with city builder.
14334,Brilliant and addictive
14335,"A super game, with endless ways to succeed of fail!"
14336,"If you're into building stuff from scratch, loved Sim City, and cannot help yourself trying to do something better and more beautiful, buy the game. There's nothing better.  Be prepared to give a healthy chunk of your life, you budding City Planner!

Intuitive design, layered sophistication in game play, and plenty of mods and tools keeps you engaged for hundreds of hours. 

I'm a relative amateur with a mere 339 hours of playtime. Just saying.

Enjoy!"
14337,it would be for 16 plus cause it is quite advaced but very good game
14338,"This game is wonderful! Hours of fun building you're own cities, and great mod support which allows for even more diverse representations of what a city can look like. Recommended if City or world building is your thing!"
14339,its Chill
14340,"Love this game! However, even on my beefed up gaming laptop, its the only game that struggles. Wish it was better in that aspect."
14341,"Everything SimCity was supposed to be, and more."

14346,Not realistic. Too little violence
14347,Everything Simcity 5 wishes it was.
14348,"I've been playing city sim games since SimCity first came out. Cities: Skylines is an excellent entry in that genre. Is there room for improvement? Yes, of course, nothing is ever perfect. But if you like city sim games, this is a must-play. The various game content/mechanics DLCs help flesh it out significantly and I'd recommend including them."

14350,Malade !
14351,"I fuck with this game
"
14352,I love this game.
14353,"very good but laggy
"
14354,"This game's pretty fun. Probably one of the best city builders out there. It has a lot of micromanaging in it which I think is great because it allows for more opportunities to customise your city.

BUT, you need to have a decent computer to run this thing, especially if you buy DLC or download mods. No potato computers, unfortunately. I had to upgrade my RAM to play this beautiful game without it crashing and having to lower the graphics to basically 10p. Now I can look at the pretty trees and stalk my citizens in 4K."

Pog"
14364,Great city builder. Has a lot of cool mods as well.
14365,"Been playing for a little while, and once you start to understand what's going on it becomes really interesting.
Mostly a slow burn game where you either challenge yourself to create a masterpiece of a city, or you simply go bat crazy and see how your population reacts.

Then you start adding mods and DLC and....well. 
Many many hours looking at traffic XD"
14366,S
14367,im bad at this game but somehow i keep coming back to it. i think that speaks for itself
14368,"I got the ragnarok mod.  I destroyed my entire city intentionally. A city of 400k pop. 10/10 would recommend everyone to do the same.

14370,Without a doubt a great game. Although some of the DLC are wayyyyyyy to expensive for their content. Also many mods dont work now a days and i cant see some of the cities i built 4 years ago which is sad.
14371,.
14372,good shit
14373,Not really my tipe of game
14374,eh
14375,It seems complicated to play at first but not really hard to get used to. I love the challenges and rewards. It's addicting once you get to know how things work inside the game.
14376,Anno for Pros... ;)
14377,wowie
14378,This game was very great and time just flies when you play this this game but it takes very long but it is very enthusiastic and amazing its pretty good and yes. :}
14379,"Its nice

"
14380,not bad
14381,A great game that can be as relaxing or as serious as you want it to be. It's fun to plan out a beautiful city and watch it grow over time :)
14382,amazing
14383,big city
14384,i love the game it is so muth fun and cratoveofteute this dolowd
14385,city game building sandbox also not sandbox very nice like wow
14386,"They do Gouge on the DLC, and its a little sad without it, but its still an amazing game"
14387,ok
14388,cool
14389,"Have you ever been beaten by a wet spaghetti noodle by your girlfriend cuz she has a twin sister and you got confused and f'd her dad, well that’s how it feels to drive a Ford F-250"
14390,"Cities: Skylines is by far the absolute best city builder ever made from an innovation standpoint. There's truly nothing like it. It takes time, sweat, and maybe even tears--but offers gratification like few other games do. Give it a try, even if you're intimidated and don't shy away from modding."
14391,it is very addicting and fun to play you can build many things and so much cool stuff from the steam work shop
14392,"Best. Game. Ever. There is obviously still room for improvement and enough room for... Skylines 2(?) The mods are awesome and the community vibrant. It's probably not for everyone, but if you like strategy, city building and ""realism"", give it a spin!"
14393,yep
14394,IT IS VERY HARD!But fun if it works.
14395,fun
14396,"Not the definitive version of the game. The version on Windows Store supports driving and walking around your city in first person. This version also has an out-of-date UI compared to the Windows Store version. Finally, this version is deliberately misleading around this -- not a single store screenshot shows the UI, so you won't notice this yourself unless you happen to have both copies lying around.

Even if this were the better version of the two, I cannot recommend buying a product that limits its functionality based on which store you buy it from."
14397,"This is one of my fave games of all time. I love builders, and love above all how many elements you can customize from Workshop additions. I can't leave it alone!"
14398,A really great game has the full freedom to make a city.
14399,Fun
14400,yes
14401,Interesting Game
14402,is gud wood recco m e n d  :3
14403,"Yes it is a very fun game, but it's optimization is pretty bad for the sandbox game that it is (no multi-core support etc.), in the vanilla it lacks many fun elements that you have to unlock via DLCs or download a shit-ton of mods/assets that end up lowering your fps drastically.
TLDR: Good game, runied by (presumably) greediness and/or poor optimization."
14404,KEEPS YOU BUSY
14405,fun game
14406,What SimCity was supposed to be
14407,good game
14408,"This Game is too stupid to even be a Game. I really tried to play the Game the way it was intended i.e without mods so I could earn more steam points and it's just a waste of time waiting for impossible progress. Seems like it's just a series of set algorithms that if not followed nothing works. Not very interactive at all if you HAVE NO CHOICE. The developers have some game play instructional videos and hey it's just a MAXIS/EA Simcity ripoff with better graphics, it shouldn't suck so much that they have to demonstrate how to play their stupid game."
14409,Its alright
14410,great game
14411,really fun city building sim
14412,"Just like SimCity, but bigger.  Not as whimsical, but beyond that, it's great."
14413,"Game is so addicting.  Plan on playing for an hour, next thing you know 5 hours have gone by.  So much fun!!"
14414,goood
14415,My favourite city-building game. So many details.
14416,"+ A lot of mods support which enhances the experience a lot
+ Probably the best city building game
+ It has very high skill cap in order to build functional city

- I consider this as a minus, because 90% of the time you will be sorting out your road infrastructure
- You will remake your city a lot at the begining (I still do), if you don't plan ahead, your traffic will collapse
- Default game lacks a lot QoL so Mods and DLCs are highly recommended"
14417,"Amazing game, very addicting and mentally stimulating, can play for hours on end."
14418,physics
14419,"I used to play sims city but when i heard of this game, i didn't expect anything and honestly thought the game was a bad rip off of sims city, but when I actually got the hang of it, I prefer city skylines a lot more than sims city, I also love how there is mods ( however, most don't run well unfortunately) If you like city builders/strategy games, I highly recommend this game"
14420,It's good.
14421,city
14422,city go boom
14423,good game
14424,It always crashes once u start up or create a savefile
14425,"Probably the greatest game I have played in a long time. I've always been a fan of RTS, 4x, and other games. It wasn't until CS that I discovered city builders. This game scratches every itch (except for the fantasy kingdom builder, but that's for a different game) when it comes to city building. I have all DLC and use the workshop extensively. If you are looking into this game also make sure you buy the DLC's in order of importance: After Dark, Mass Transit, Industries, Snowfall, Parklife, Sunset Harbor and then the rest. Then be prepared to enter the world of the Steam Workshop. The workshop is what makes this game a legendary one. Endless hours of entertainment can be had through it."
14426,"I have gotten nothing else done in my life, lost my job, my family left me, I sit alone in a shed with amazing internet because this game has consumed my life. I don't eat, and now I only dream of building roads and zoning High density. Just save yourself now, and skip over this game. I am lost my friend, but you still have a chance!"
14427,Heil
14428,amogus
14429,it's fun and satisfying when you know the trick
14430,awesome game
14431,-
14432,Paradox' marketing scheme is DansGame
14433,It's pog
14434,this is singlehandedly my favorite game and only game i play
14435,tl:dr people complain about everything
14436,"I sunk much more time into this game than I would like to admit. As someone who came from SimCity, this game has all the things that I felt was missing from SimCity, freeways, metros, decently sized maps! Additionally, the support of modding through the steam workshop is really would makes this game great by allowing you to do nearly anything with your city. I would recommend this game to anyone who is interested in a city builder game."
14437,"This is one of the most addictive games I've ever played, I love building cities that looks realistic"
14438,"much fun,very happy"
14439,"This game is unbelievable in so many ways, the DLC's are great and the personal mod's that can be downloaded only make the game so much better. Cities Skylines is the greatest sim/management game ever!"
14440,"Fun game and cool simulator, would recommend:)"
14441,Best city builder so far.
14442,Great game!
14443,Best city sim builder out there hands down!
14444,nice
14445,"Like to build things and want time to evaporate like magic? THIS. 
Ignoring all the fun of the actual city building sim, sometimes I get lost in sculpting waterfalls for hours, or draw crazy networks of road exchanges. You can completely modify the landscape in map creation mode; add hills, bluffs, ponds, plant trees bushes and flowers, add water sources, plot wildlife spawn points. Most sims never let me place natural features, create custom parks, or draw winding trails and walking paths - this one does! Sometimes kiddo and I just sit and rename people, roads and places for entertainment. Sandbox mode is amazing for playing gawd. I'll never go back to my other city/world building sims... this one just has so much more, better, easier, tools to customize your little world. Plus all the user created content that you can add. I haven't even scratched the surface of commercial areas, industry, exports, trains, subways. WOWZA, this will keep me busy for years. Love it guys. Thanks for an amazing game!"
14446,TRW24
14447,i have aids
14448,"[h1] Very good if you are interested in building based games [/h1]

A very fun game if you are interested in any sort of building based game (Minecraft, Terraria etc.). There is also a great workshop. I would recommend TMPE Mod and 81 Tiles mod. These two are my favourites and they are both available on the Steam Workshop for Cities Skylines. Would also recommend Mass Transit DLC as a must have, and Concerts DLC (for concerts radio) if you like playing wearing a headset and listening to the game sound. My only problem is that you have to pay for every update. Every time a new update comes, it is a paid DLC. There is also a free update, but it's barely anything. I wish that they also updated the base game, adding free maps and buildings etc."
14449,Built stuff look at pretty roads and railroads
14450,"Likely the most addictive game I've ever played; I bought it at the beginning of the C-19 pandemic and have joyfully poured many, many hours and days into my pet-projects. So much love to the devs!"
14451,The Best City Building Game Ever. You can build up to millions citizen.
14452,I built a great big city while listening to rock and roll. You could almost say I built a city on rock and roll. Then I never played it again. I would only buy on sale as I only play these types of games once or twice.
14453,"i am addicted
"
14454,Auto save is a joke. It replaces previous save data. I lost my city save because of it. auto save should create separate save files not automatically overwrite a save... I LOST A CITY WITH 30 THOUSAND PEOPLE i'm so beyond upset. please fix this I don't want to loose city data... I even created a separate save and it still had over written my save files.
14455,"This is the most diverse, complete, detailed, and customisable city builder available today. It has replaced SimCity and surpassed all other city builders as the go-to simulator for anyone interested in the genre, and it is friendly to both beginners and experienced gamers. I can guarantee that you won't be sorry that you bought this game: it is 100% worth the money."
14456,"the game will let you build cities, but the mods will let you build dreams."
14457,All the yes.
14458,This is my favorite game of all time!!  I have been a fan of sim city ever since I played it on the super nintendo.  I cities Skylines with a ton of mods and when my old computer would no longer play it I dropped $4000.00 on a new rig.  I have played this game in the deserts of Iraq on my laptop!  And it helped me keep my sanity.  I highly recommend this game to anyone who is into city builders.  Out of my hundreds of games and DLC owned I recommend City Skylines over each and everyone of them!  My first upload to the steam workshop was a map I made for cities a few years back. And I am currently working on my second.  Cities is so photo realistic sometimes I forget I am playing a game.  If you love the sim city franchise not including their last release a few years back which everyone thought sucked then you are going to love this game 100x more.  Once you start playing you lose track of time and forget to move around a walk every now and then running the risk of blood clots in your legs.  Yes this game is so addictive it can be a hazard to your health so don't for get to take a little walk around your room every hour or so!!!  I have just recently started playing after a long break of playing other titles and EA games I have been waiting on and since I have been gone the workshop has been accumulating so many good addons from an amazing community of moders!  Why are you still reading this?  Click add to cart already!!!
14459,a
14460,"I've put a lot of thought into this.

I recommend this game."
14461,"In my opinion, this game is very suitable for gamer who like building and creating. When you just begin play you will think the game is very easy, just build road, facility,... But when it become bigger you will find that it very hard to manage traffic. So that it require you have to plan from the begin of the game. You can make beautiful city, the limited is your imagination"
14462, I believe game is about manufacturing sewage lines but most importantly where and when the vice president of the united states not this united states but the last united states when.. where? why.....
14463,The game is super realistic and is awesome! It hasn't been a week yet and I've been playing for 10 hours
14464,Traffic
14465,SUPER FUN
14466,best city builder since sim city 4
14467,its fun
14468,Sim City on all the steroids! An absolutely amazing  game!
14469,Lovely
14470,"Oh you wanna know how to be rich?
--------------------------------------
Step 1 : Make a gud city
Step 2 : Trow trash in the water and blame all the polution on the citzens
Step 3 : ( ‾ʖ̫‾) Profit ( ‾ʖ̫‾)"
14471,"It kind of sucks that Paradox is so greedy that they charge money for almost anything. You want blue cars? Five bucks. Other than that, they can really make good games. My fav is by far HOI 3. But I digress. I like Cities. Finding out why there is a traffic jam is so strangely satisfying. Just buy it. Its gonna be worth it. (maybe wait for sale) PS: Cos Paradox is kind of hustlers."
14472,goooooooooooooooood
14473,"You build your own CITY! Cant it be better? I think this game is hard to understand at the beginning but later you going to understand.

Very fun. At least buy it on sale and test it."
14474,The mods + game = awesome
14475,"great game
played it for hours"
14476,
14477,best city yet
14478,"fun game, lost many hours to it, love trying to solve the problems in a city, and knowing when to build or improve the current infrastruture"
14479,"Really great City building simulator game that has realism in it. Since my review won't be seen and if you are reading my review right now, just read the others and you will know why I give this game a 10/10."
14480,Well i have sunk 450 hours into this game and basically enjoyed every minute of it. The limits are your imagination thanks to the modding community. This community in general is one of the best i have been a part of. There is so much content on Youtube of people playing this game and teaching it. There are community build tournaments and engaging activities between content creators and the community. The discord servers are very friendly and helpful to new player. Honestly if you like this style of game i believe its worth every penny. 10/10 would recommend.
14481,fun
14482,"Some new update requires that they gather all your personal information for whatever reason? Not sure why, wasn't needed before. I'll just keep this purchased copy in my list and torrent the game instead"
14483,"I love how this game is so easy to mod! at east the steam version is,"
14484,Highly recommend to anyone who wants an easygoing city builder.
14485,"such an addicting and satisfying game, gets exponentially better with mods"
14486,"Base game = limited stuff
NO DLC = Not fun :(
have to buy all DLC to get full game ... Just like APPLE

"
14487,"This game is brilliant and dynamic mix between a classic city builder and a modern planning game. It brings a new level of complexity to city building that no other game could. Furthermore, it is visually stunning in every way, screenshot simulator!"

14510,"This is the only city simulator I've played. It has flaws, it has room for improvement. But it is one of its kind and, therefore, the best we can have right now. I wish I didn't have to install a multitude of mods to have access to certain basic functions (like fine traffic management, flexible placement, settings like smog visibility and behavior rules, wider range of capacity for city service buildings, etc.). Now and then I start this game, play for a while, and then I run into the wall such as reaching the capacity of my PC or the simulation becoming so large and complex (with no possibility of district management) that the city become ungovernable. But I still come back to it"

14533,"This is the best city building game ever.  Having played SimCity from the original through 2000, 3000, 4, Rush  Hour, and the reboot... none of that comes close to Cities: Skylines.  This is the best city simulation game that has ever existed to date."

14537,you can make people swim in poo
14538,"I'm leaving this review after quite a bit of hours playing this game (the hours on record maybe reflect 10% of the amount of time I played the game over the years).

This is game is revolutionary. It is revolutionary in terms of scope and in terms of scale. It gives the causal gamer gamer a feeling that they are real city planners, trying to bring the city of their dream to virtual life. Personally I enjoyed mostly trying to build an efficient, vibrant and live city, with my main focus devoted to transportation (the Mass Transit DLC is probably a ""necessary"" DLC for this game).

So why I do not recommend this game?
In my opinion, it is already outdated. While it still holds the thrown of the best city planning game, it is lacking in numerous areas:
- The simulation aspect is very lacking, movement specifically. This includes both pedestrian and especially vehicles.
- The game pays too little attention to walking/cycling. There are no many options to manage ""walkability"" or cycling.
- Related to the previous point, but all buildings must be placed on roads. If walking played a more important role, it would make more sense to allow more freedom in building placement.
- The game is a bit too cartoony. Many cars and buildings tend to be very cartoony, possibly because it is harder to build a fully realistic city, but also possible it's just an artistic choice (which I personally don't like) of the game directors.
- Parking which is a critical infrastructure piece (especially for a vehicle heavy game) is missing from the game completely.
- The vanilla game is very limited as well. Especially around planning/designing/plotting the city. Most users rely on mods, which is not necessarily a bad thing, but there are too many functionalities that should have been put in the base game.

Rumors have started to mount for a sequel. Considering it has been almost 7 years since launch, it makes a lot of sense that one is coming. I really hope they do make a sequel and improve on all of these points and more."
14539,"Fun
"
14540,nice
14541,"Very epic, highly recommend"
14542,Awesome game. Pretty much all there is to it. If you like this style of game then there isnt any reason not to own it.
14543,"good game
"
14544,"Epic city builder, great community of assets and mods. A true sandbox for creating cities you have dreamed of, everything from past to the future."
14545,very gudd
14546,The game might seem boring at first. The more you play the better it gets.
14547,traffuc
14548,Just a nice city builder. The amount of DLC and its price is quite bad though.
14549,Nice!
14550,It's awesome!
14551,"very great game, there's an unlimited possibility to what your mind can make in game. great time killer"
14552,"Imagine SimCity, but with much more realistic traffic management, city services, public transit, resident AI, and overall look. Then add larger map size and far deeper customization options, including a large assortment of ploppable buildings and props, a built-in asset editor, and a massive library of mods and custom assets.

When you're done with all that, take out the game-breaking, unresolvable bugs that plagued SimCity.

Now sit back and enjoy."
14553,Love it. Easy to learn and fun to improve on. Typically play action and sports games but this is one i always come back to.
14554,They really thought of everything when developing this game. It is very detailed and fun to play.
14555,Great for people who like fixing problems and making things better over time. Put on some lofi music and get lost for 3 hours.
14556,it has the pleage and killed my people
14557,Made an entire city just to make it explode in 1 minute. Would do again.
14558,Best building game ever!
14559,"I love this game, and I recommend it to anyone who is a fan of city builders like the old Sim City titles. The game does have some performance issues and limitations due to its age and engine, but the depth of game play, design options, player freedom, replayability, and the robust and active workshop more than make up for that to me"

14561,"such a fun game!

14562,it p;ay good
14563,I think it's the best in its type
14564,Good Brain Game.
14565,amazing game
14566,factowy
14567,"Not that I am some sort of big gamer, but I was planning to try this one out for quite a time. And it is greatly above my expectations!

At first it was a little confusing, but anyone should play several times from a scratch with a thought in his mind that he is doing it for ""learning and experience only"". Once you reach your first 100k citizens with traffic above 90%, then you can start to experiment with various things (including mods). At least that's my suggestion.

And once you reach that (mods, I mean) you can start truly appreciating the extensive width the game provides. Not that there are no issues here and there, but for me this game is a definitive gift for my leisure time."
14568,"Love it, absolutely recommended!"
14569,yes like
14570,very good
14571,supper
14572,This game is amazing 1000000% reccomend
14573,let ya fantasy go
14574,"Although I am not recommending the game, this can be a lot of fun actually! Within Cities Skylines, you take the role as a city planner, and while building your city, you have to face several challenges such as building up your city with good infrastructure, housing, electricity production and several others, while making sure these different aspects do not clash too much with each other. For example, building a coal plant next to housed will make your citizens less happy and sick. Overall, the bigger your city gets, the more challenges you will face and in that sense the game is very fun to play!

However, since I started my urban planning study, I more and more start to notice how the game follows the North-American (especially US and Canada) way of planning a city, which by now we can conclude fails in real life. The game forces you to use zoning in your city, which makes it almost impossible to build thriving neighbourhoods where citizens can walk to their local shops for example. Just like in North America, the game is very car-centric. You can only construct buildings next to a road for cars, which makes a lot of citizens use cars a lot instead of public transport. This eventually leads to massive traffic jams in your city, which forces you to spend most on your time into solving traffic congestion by building extra roads and lanes later in the game. Again, in real life, especially outside the US and Canada, urban planners came to the conclusion that building cities around cars is wrong in almost every way. Still, Cities Skylines forces you to plan your city in this car-centric way, with asphalt everywhere. Public transport definitely is available and is being used by citizens, but my experience is that your options are pretty limited, because most citizens will keep taking cars, even if the traffic jams are that bad that public transport would always be quicker. The concept of induced demand does only exist in a very limited way. This means that building many metro lines, that in real life will make roads less busy because people will start taking the metro, does not fix your problems. Now of course people will say, 'but it's only a game', and that is true of course. However, I think the game gives a pretty wrong idea of how cities should be built, which for me takes the pleasure of playing it away. Cities should be built around people and not around cars. But enough about that! Feel free to start the discussion with me here in case you disagree!

Besides my frustration above, the game, like I said, gives you the oppurtunity to create massive cities, and will definitely bring hours of enjoyment if you are okay with planning the North-American way. Before I started my study I used to enjoy this game a lot, which says a lot about it I think."
14575,"To me, I use this game as a modular world. With the excessive amounts of mods and assets I've added, it becomes possible to recreate any excisting city. The vanilla game is fine, but to me, the mods and assets really completes the game. The modding community is also very helpful and doesn't seem to die out even though the game has been out for so long, new mods and a ton of new assets are published every month.

If you are the creative type and have a nack for city building, this is THE game to play"
14576,Very Nice
14577,"The ultimate city builder! Even with just the base game you can do so much and it will have you locked in right from the beginning! When I play this I get so into it I lose track of time most of the time haha! Sometimes there can be glitches with things like the train and bus metro systems, but besides that I really haven't had any complaints! One of my all-time favorite games!! :>"
14578,It's better than Minecraft
14579,"Just now getting in to this game and loving it so far.  So much fun with the bendy roads.  Lots more to master, but 10/10 in my book.  If that changes, I'll let you know.  :)"
14580,Lol
14581,I feel like a kid playing in my sandbox and an old grandpa with trains. I dont know what it is but a few mins turns into hours. Love this game.
14582,This game is great for creating aesthetic cities and having fun ruining your road system causing people to wait literal days in traffic. Shame so much content is locked behind DLC but they are cheap so..
14583,its like building a city in real life
14584,really fun game. its nice to play once in a while to relax
14585,Fun and addicting game
14586,"After playing it for a couple of years on and off. i have to say it's an amazing game!
sometimes the AI are a bit scuffed, but you can fix that with mods.
And after i while you will have alot of mods!
9/10 game :)"
14587,I'll recomended when it fucking works for once
14588,inspiring and unintentionally educational.
14589,"yo, this game be tight! much accurate, hella interesting, most def worth a try bro!"
14590,"Very good game, however the experience can be improved with mods for transportation (ex. more road) [airports have been taken care of due to Airports DLC] and you can get mods for buildings"
14591,wowiw
14592,amazing game but without mods its hard to really make money
14593,Playable
14594,"very fun once mods are installed, tho this keeps crashing randomly (i would assume this is due to using certain mods alongside playing on an M1 macbook pro so it's being emulated"
14595,h
14596,Verry good
14597,This is the best cuity-building game ever made! (nothing more to say)
14598,good but sim city is better
14599,stole my life good game
14600,What can I say? When it comes to city builders there is truly no equal. Stop reading reviews and click buy!
14601,Honestly a relaxing game.
14602,city go brrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr
14603,"Been a CS player for quite some time now and have enjoyed the hundreds of hours i have sunk in this game. My only gripe is that the their are very few updates with any major content. Most of the time its just some workshop content with a price tag (I don't mind that much because it supports the creators who give us a lot of free stuff) or some music. Would love to see something major in the next DLC or at least something that would add to the game complexity. The updates at this point have almost stalled entirely.
If they're making Cities Skylines 2 then maybe its understandable but there is now update or news."
14604,Has the feel of the old Sim City but the graphics are better.
14605,"A note in the beginning: I am playing a heavily modded version of the game, so my review is mostly targeting the design purpose of the game. 

The game itself has a basic structure. You start of with a limited amount of funds and a highway entrance. Over time you will slowly expand, fulfill the needs of you citizen, give them power, water and treat their sewage. You need to grow your city to gain more money to afford more streets, more infrastructure, more parks to raise the land value.

And now to the modded part: Via the Workshop you can get a lot of different mods, assets, maps, color corrections and so on. You can create photorealistic graphics, areas which aren't differentable from real life, and can make your own megacity. This is the idea, at least. In the real World, you will soon find the limit of your PC, and even if your PC is able to run 100 mods and 8000+ assets, you will soon reach the limitations of the game. But still, you will continue to push this limits, as it is simply so extremly rewarding to create realisitc cities.

After 1850 hours of playing this game, I came to 2 conclusions. Cities Skylines changed my life, and still I feel like I need to move on. I have spent around 100 hours just fixing errors after updates, spend 1000 hours of just planning out cities and enjoying it. I still like this game alot, and it is definitely a good game, but you need to be aware that you will need to spend a lot of time into it.

Additionaly i want to say, that imo not all the DLC`s are necessary, as a lot of stuff is already available on the Workshop for free."

14618,"Absolutely recommend!!! - 10/10

Pros
- It can be whatever you want it to be,manage a realistic economy where things are expensive and demand fluctuates, or build your dream city with infinite resources
- Absolutely endless mods; cars, planes, trains, boats, buildings, essential quality-of-life improvements, literally whatever
- Surprising amounts of visual realism are attainable
- The community is absolutely insane and helpful, both Reddit and Steam Workshop are great, loads of YouTube/Twitch content
- Basically the perfect building/urban design/infrastructure sandbox
- Even the vanilla is really chill and friendly
- Infinite replay value, easy to get re-addicted every few months
- Spaghetti

Cons
- Requires [very] beefy computer setup/not super well optimized for what it is
- The vanilla game has some basic UX/qol shortcomings that can really only be corrected with mods"

14646,my city is mine. its good city
14647,"This is THE best city builder I've ever played (I have way more actual hours than this record on Steam). 

It's in-depth, rewards experience, trial and error and leaves room for substantial creativity once you know how everything works. There are some essential mods IMO without which the game isn't playable (see Traffic Manager and Networks Extensions 2) and the DLCs add a lot and are must-haves for me (so ready your wallet), but it's worth it.

If you're interested in a complex, replayable and rewarding city builder, this is the one for you. If you're coming from Anno, don't expect a resources manager. While Cities does have that element to it and it's important, it's really many more aspects that form a complete whole.

Mostly though, it's a traffic manager. If your traffic sucks, everything falls apart. However, the way you combine proper road layouts with public transport, correct zoning, city services, parks, etc; that's what makes this game a masterpiece. 

I've also started playing on Hard Mode for my latest city and it really shows. Costs, upkeep and lower income really makes you weigh your decisions and district policies. It's really just awesome.

Get it, learn it, and make a unique and functioning city."

14652,Stop trying to look for the bad comments and just play the game. The game is amazing and i would rate 10/10
14653,.
14654,"Cities: Skylines is a fun game but very flawed.  City planning in this game is very very car centered and at least with the stock experience even the metros leave a lot to be desired.  You will likely have a ton of fun growing your city to the highest population but after that there is not really anything to do.  I imagine I could get a better experience with mods if I wished but  to be honest I am just not that invested.  Don't get me wrong this game is not bad, it just feels incredibly limiting and has a lot of wasted potential.  If it is on a good sale I would say get it like I did for $6 but the normal asking price of $30 is really steep."

Now i bought it on steam and after trying it on multiple systems i can say it performs terrible on all of them. Buy simcity 4 instead it is a lot more fun. Loading times are really bad and it seems like the game overall is just not optimized very well or not at all for that matter(It main feature seems to be leaking memory).

14682,"there's a lot to this game/ its really fun though. bit confusing at times, but overall really fun way to chill"
14683,I LOVE THIS GAME. Never run out of new stuff to do thanks to amazing workshop creators.
14684,I spent more time trying to get pipes to work then actually playing the game. I basically spent 30 dollars for a pipe simulator.
14685,Nice
14686,fuck this game its ass
14687,"*chefs kiss*

this game is addicting help"
14688,"I mean...  do I even need to say anything, just look at my hours on the game. The game is fantastic, if you get it on sale you can purchase the previously expensive DLC's for much cheaper! You do not need a high end PC to play this game... I have a 1050 with 4gb of video memory, I recommend you put this game on your SSD and have more than 8gb or ram... if you  are highly modded like me I recommend over 16gb of ram

Amazing game!"
14689,mmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm
14690,i get lost playing this. such a good game.
14691,its too complicated sometimes
14692,LIKED
14693,"Had some great fun in this game, tho, sadly they got active recently, by just posting this ""months"" best mods, every month, that's literally all news since i bought this game, there is no real development going on the last 12 months.

Therefore i cannot recommend this cause it still has a lot of major bugs in the main game."
14694,Nice and fun. Always love to plan and build a  new city. Very relaxing. :)
14695,I Just Love This Game. At First When You Get It Your A Bit Confused. But After Playing It Its So fun. Love This Game :)
14696,Waaaaay better than simcity... I love that you can have the mods and actually have really businesses and brands of cars in your city. Love it!
14697,I have played this game for years now on both PC and X Box. This game has provided years of enjoyment for me and for that it deserves a thumbs up!
14698,NAIZO
14699,"Made a giant district that spelled out ""Poo."" Street names consist of - Dookie Drive, Wasn't a Fart Park, Shart Street....
I am very satisfied."
14700,Absolutely love this game! with mods and the extensive youtube community for it there are endless possibilities. Wish that they would add a way to make your own building in game though.
14701,"DLC business model is criminal, but it's a fun game."
14702,"I have never been so happy with a city builder and please don't make cities skylines 2, just keep making this one better. You might add DLC's for different parts of the world, or DLC's for mod integration, or DLC's for higher levels of detail to the base game. It's great!"
14703,So far just from playing for a few hours I absolutely love this game. It is a little annoying when you have NO IDEA WHAT IS CAUSING THOSE PROBLEMS STOP YELLING AT ME OR ILL SORROUND YOUR HOUSE WITH GOD DAMNED CLINICS SO EVERYTIME YOU GET THE FCKN CORONA FROM THAT GARBAGE DUMP YOU HAVE 30 DOCTORS RUSHED TO YOUR HOME AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAaa... sorry its like a 8/10
14704,Top 3 games all time.
14705,"Wether you're into citybuilding and building your own public transport networks or you'd like to detail out your own Parks and waterfront promenades, this is a game for you. Many possibilities, a wide array of services and good looking graphics.
There are some missing things and frustrating mechanics, but you'll find your way around that. And whatever you're missing, the workshop will have it for you."
14706,"""Cities:Skylines - The Traffic Manager""   

Having a big city with mods and just watching the traffic flow is pure dopamin for me! Sometimes i just scroll and stare at it for hours. 

Now i only have one wish: I'd love to be able to transform my city into a GTA3 map and be able to drive around it. (my vehicles are already modded into GTA stlye :D)

"
14707,it is super fun because it is strat based and fun
14708,"Good Sim game for creative people, or people with a god complex"
14709,it is a very nice and relaxing game

14721,"i like building da cities. i thought id play this like once, fuck around and then never play it again but its addicting"
14722,Best in class
14723,"Tons of fun mods, you can be as detail oriented as you want or not for those who prefer something that doesn't require as many brain cells. Gives you the ability to create beautiful functioning cities."
14724,"One of the best city simulation games. A lot more flexibility than other city building games and ways to beautify and customize your city, your way."
14725,Super cool game ong ong ong ong ong ong ong ong on my momma this game is lit
14726,"its an amazing game you should get it.
"
14727,I wasn't doing game addiction properly until I got this one
14728,You waste more time downloading and managing mods than playing the game 10/10
14729,good
14730,Better than SimCity
14731,Awesome game!
14732,Great game!!!
14733,"1. Hands down Cities: Skylines is by far the best city simulation game of it's era. What SimCity maybe aspired to be but fell far far short of. I say this with 600Hours of play.
2. You can create any city almost anywhere on the globe to a detail level that really, only a fanatic may be able to appreciate if you are OCD. 
3. This game is wonderfully mod-able with a very strong support from the modding community. 

Yes you can buy the add-on's for the game and some more than others add some great depth. But you don't NEED the content packs to play this game or to have a lot of fun. You more than get your moneys worth of entertainment before you become bored (If you like city sims that is) without any of the payed for add-on's. 

Also to people that complain about how much it costs to get all the content for this game... Come the F-On people.. go to the movies for 2 hours. It's going to run you and your other a safe 50 bucks for tickets, popcorn and drinks. For going to the movies maybe twice you get dozens if not hundreds of hours of entertainment potential that you can access easily. Now add any of the (Free) amazing mods from the community and the value is through the roof. Great games cost money!! To support great teams making great games you vote with your wallet and buy the add-ons that you like!! Be HAPPY and GRATEFUL that Paradox has developed Skylines into what we all wanted or wished SimCity to become. 

In closing you will be hard pressed to find a better Sim game where you can manage, watch, and control your own personal microcosm. It's easily worth buying the base game not on sale."
14734,"hmm, fun for 21.7 hours"
14735,Its fun
14736,nice

14739,yes

14741,This game is really cool. You can make cities and have everything you would ever imagine in a city!
14742,Nice relaxing game
14743,"I'm addicted, and I'm pretty much sure you would be too."
14744,"good, it can be more like the real life citys, but its greet."
14745,IT'S TOO FFUNN
14746,"One of the best city simulation games ever you can just build any country / city you can think of with so many mods only how much space is the requirement

Pros
+Great mod support and community
+Sandbox mode
+Heaps of cool dlc's"
14747,"I found this game hard, good thing there are mods :)"
14748,"good
"
14749,"Great game to drone out too. Very beautiful and the mods are very helpful. I would suggest watching a youtube video before trying this game. Its extremely detailed, lots of things to do and lots of things you can screw up. I have so much fun on this game and I really reccomend you buy it. Its sim city on steroids."
14750,"Think about all the things you hate about your hometown's traffic, then make the exact opposite in this game, enjoy seamless traffic.

10/10 would redesign Jakarta 100 times over."
14751,great games ever!!!!!!!!
14752,"Unless you're willing to pay 200 euros to have the full game then don't bother, the base game doesn't even allow you to build things you'd normally expect in a city builder game so going to have to pass."
14753,yes
14754,"This is - as of late 2021 - still the definitive city-building game. It succeeds as an outstanding modern SimCity successor where Maxis stumbled in the genre due to EA's meddling.

It looks beautiful, it's feature rich, and very open to modding and customization to take it beyond even the massive number of features and extensions the developers have made available to begin with. 

Great, thriving user community too."
14755,"one of my favorite games

8/10 its pretty good"
14764,"merely added anything to the good old sim city, no politics was a big surprise and delusion to me"
14765,"I really love this game. you can start and stop whenever you want. and return days later to continue building. The workshop asset files are sometimes a mess, but hell. you can't win 'm all"
14766,I bulldozed an elementary school to make room for a highway. I love this game.
14767,Very Epic
14768,"I've been playing this game for a few years now, this game does a lot right it is a very detailed game that lets you build a city and manage it to perfection. That being said dont let this game intimidate you, not only is the tooltips comprehensive but the game can be played as simply or as in depth as you like meaning people who want to jump right in have no problem. Now where this game really shines is in the Mods and this is where you can really get in depth with adding assets to make your city more realistic manage your traffic to a tea and overall improve the realism and depth of the game to an amazing level. This game isnt perfect from the janky water physics to the constant struggle to get perfect traffic management but I would recommend this for anyone who is into creating building or management games."

14771,"I'm saying this from the start, you will never be able to make a realistic city like the gigachads.

14772,good
14773,"i think its bad to lock the (probably) majority of the game behind a 200 euros paywall
still a solid game, but kinda scummy the monetization"
14774,"Pretty good, I guess."
14775,"I really wish I was more willing to dedicate time to this game. I think that it teaches you a lot. For what time I have spent on it, I really enjoy it. It's definitely the best city builder to date and the mod community makes it all the better."
14776,ggod
14777,Very good and interactive.
14778,Very Fun To Play
14779,Great game with a lot of customisability via Workshop items.. not sure there's much that this game cannot do when it comes to Simulating a city.
14780,it is very complicated but if you like learning this is a game for you
14781,LOVE IT!
14782,"CITY SKYLINES
"
14783,good
14784,"Large sandbox city simulator, much like the sims. requires 70303 expansions to add basic features.

Base game, 8/10. With dlcs, 9/10. :)"
14785,Good game
14786,A city builder where you can choose stoplights and stop signs!  What more could you want?
14787,"To be clear, I don’t recommend it specifically for Mac. It looks like a really fun game, and if you’re on Windows you should go ahead and try it. But if you’re on Mac be aware that you’ll be missing key controls unless you get additional software or equipment to make your computer compatible."
14788,10/10 destroyed my city using a tsunami :D
14789,somehow my it's telling me I need to purchase the game again.... GO STEAM!!!
14790,Very fun and addicting
14791,Very Addictive Game
14792,runs smooth easy download and lots of mods
14793,"My son and I play this game, debating over what to do. Reminds me of sitting around playing SimCity with my friends in the computer lab in the 90's."
14794,"Love cities skylines. Couldn't imagine playing it without mods. Paradox embraces mods and assets which is a nice change of pace compared to EA and sh*t like that. Overall really fun game, easy to learn and easy to modify to your preferences."
14795,"Thanks paradox, very cool!"
14796,One of the best current city builders.
14797,I like the sandbox aspect of this game.
14798,At least u can play it without DLCs 😐
14799,"Build a city. Idk, it's a good game. ¯\_(ツ)_/¯"
14800,u build cities
14801,"This game is great, but mods are needed once you get past a certain point. 
Ir you have a city with 200,000 people its impossible to keep up with all of the micromanagement tasks like emptying trash and stuff like that. 
There are mods that make it automatic and they make the game playable and great"

14816,"Loved it , an amazing city building experience"
14817,"It is the most expensive drug you will buy...

You are better off trying cocaine..."

14820,Great with no lag if have lag find vidio to reduce it then great dont spend 10hr
14821,if u ban gay people in your city for some reason people start paying taxes you should play
14822,make my brain work again. haha
14823,"What sim city should have been. Its the best city builder out now, bar none.
The only downside is the amount of content behind dlc."
14824,Awsome game!
14825,cool
14826,this game is the best!
14827,it gud
14828,"Cities: Skylines is a relaxing and fun game for me. You start off as a small town and progress to a large city. And you can do this at your own pace and watch as your town/city grow. There will be problems that arise in your city, and that helps you realize how hard it is to maintain. But solving and managing problems makes it fun. I give this game a 9 out of 10"
14829,"Amazing game and still relevant in 2021, However traffic lane AI sucks"
14830,"Best city building / transport simulator, but needs to be heavily moded to be still fun with big cities."
14831,"Pretty simple: if you grew up with Sim City like me and are looking for a modern version, this is what you should buy. Hugely modable with an amazing community with tons of content, it's a city builder's dream. Kind of a lot of DLC (Paradox title, so par for the course) but you can pick and choose which you like, and even the base game is pretty darn good. Overall just a wonderfully realized concept that brings me back to the Sim City games of yore."

I'm unsure how the game is even stable with all these mods but somehow it just works and I couldn't be happier with that result.  I can also finally use Adobe After Effects properly now so thank you, Colossal Order, for making me upgrade my RAM."

14854,I LOVE IT!
14855,"Like sim city, but better."
14856,I like the dynamics of this city building game. You should play this if you are a simulation game fanatic and you want to build your own city. There are many exciting things happening. I recommend you get the right creator pack. :)
14857,"took my whole day, and i was very tired before i started."
14858,the update that simcity needed
14859,This is the best city build/managing game in the past 15 years. 11/10

14862,fun
14863,OUR city now!

14865,"This game is highly addictive, but I love it."
14866,it is like simcity on 'roids. just play it.
14867,A well rounded city sim builder
14868,"Almost heaven, West Virginia
Blue Ridge Mountains, Shenandoah River
Life is old there, older than the trees
Younger than the mountains, growin' like a breeze

Country roads, take me home
To the place I belong
West Virginia, mountain momma
Take me home, country roads

All my memories, gather 'round her
Miner's lady, stranger to blue water
Dark and dusty, painted on the sky
Misty taste of moonshine, teardrops in my eyes

Country roads, take me home
To the place I belong
West Virginia, mountain momma
Take me home, country roads

I hear her voice in the mornin' hour she calls me
Radio reminds me of my home far away
Drivin' down the road I get a feelin'
That I should have been home yesterday, yesterday

Country roads, take me home
To the place I belong
West Virginia, mountain momma
Take me home, country roads

Country roads, take me home
To the place I belong
West Virginia, mountain momma
Take me home, country roads

Take me home, down country roads
Take me home, down country roads"
14869,The only thing I disliked was it was a little laggy.
14870,Great Great Game
14871,"Chill, just a  nice progression.  Not very challenging and not much pressure."
14872,"Pretty good, isn't it"
14873,It is in my opinion the best city building game on the marketplace. I think it's hard to make a better game then this. The mods on the workshop make the game limitless.
14874,I can put a meteorite into a water and cause a tsunami! 5 stars!
14875,"fun game
"
14876,great for timewasting
14877,"The foremost modern-era city-builder, has earned its reputation. Can be a bit pricy to buy-in with the extensive DLC list, but the steam workshop adds more content than official content ever could."
14878,This game is phenomenal
14879,"just a good game

14880,Good game

14885,Interesting game for people that want to sit in front of computer more than 2-3 hours
14886,good
14887,will make you appreciate totalitarianism
14888,"The base game alone is absolutely worth the money, you'll sink plenty of hours into micromanaging most aspects of the city. The DLCs can get expensive, but there are sales pretty frequently, so just snag them then. perfect mix of idle and active game-play, and the feeling of running a smooth city is rather satisfying."
14889,The best city sim on the market! If you're interested enough to be reading the reviews then just buy it because you'll enjoy it.
14890,"Best sim game ever, I've been playing for years and keep finding new things to create."
14891,"I have been playing this game for a while and really enjoyed it. Recently however i have noticed that the game makes it impossible to stop cars from being used. I have made so many attempts with even mods included to try to make my cities walkable but it never works.

I feel this game is teaching a generation that cars are the only way to make a city, when in fact they are what destroy cities. I feel this could be fixed with a dlc that makes cities more walkable."
14892,Best traffic simulator on the market.
14893,good
14894,Its great
14895,wow

14901,I liked stuff
14902,"I am not the first to say this, but Cities: Skylines is by far the best city sim I have played. I grew up playing the original simcity, simcity for the Super Nintendo was my favorite game, and I played the hell out of Simcity 2000 and Simcity 4. In recent years I was forced to still play simcity 4 due to the aging hardware I had, but once I got a new device I knew I had to try this game. 

This is simply the greatest city sim game I have played. The controls are fairly easy, little of it is confusing, and after watching a couple of beginner videos on youtube (shout out to a city planner plays), I have dived into the deep end. I'm blown away at the realism that this game is able to capture without making a player have to fiddle with everything. Still haven't gotten into the mods, but I had to pick up the after dark dlc for bike lanes. 

This is a definite pick up."
14903,yes
14904,"So immersive, such an active modding community. I can't imagine a better city builder."
14905,the best

14912,its a gayme?
14913,"Just pure zen strategy game (opinion from a Starcraft and OpenTTD player).
Get [b]inspired[/b] by creators such as [b]Biffa[/b] or [b]City Planner Plays[/b].
Get the [b]mods[/b] (via Steam for free), the expansions (most paid), and get involved with the community.
It'll make your time worthwhile, 'cause very few games allow you to enjoy Music, News, Learning, Documentaries, Series or Movies while you're passing time making a beautiful function fictional world."
14914,Just a good city sim
14915,fun
14916,This game is cool if you are cool

14920,I have over 200 hours on this game so I would be lieing if I said it wasn’t addictive
14921,"nice?

14923,A good game better than simscity
14924,+
14925,its beter then sim city
14926,luv it

14941,good game
14942,SO. MUCH. FUN!!!!
14943,"This game allows for maximum creativity.However, the game also eats up ram and CPU resources but overall it is a fantastic game."
14944,Best city-building-game on Steam (my opinion)
14945,Constant fun. Never the same gameplay. Absolutely best game on steam.
14946,"Pro: Simply the best alternative/successor to SimCity on the market, which says a lot.

Cons: the DLC's, despite bringing some nice stuff, may be a bit overpriced in regards to how impactful they actually are: I recommend enjoying the base game first before rushing into all and every available additional content to purchase."
14947,PLAY
14948,"I grew up playing the first 4 Simcity games, and then EA decided to turn it into a cash grab mobile game.
I jumped from SImcity 4 to Cities Skylines and never looked back.
Paradox games in my opinion builds much better games then Maxis/EA. This is a great games with 100% freedom to do what you like. It has  a vast Workshop community creating great content for free."
14949,Great game to play. Only issue I've seen is traffic.
14950,"It is a good game but I can be very laggy at times, but it is good, all of the DLC are worth it and it is just an all around good game."
14951,Definitely  one of the best games I ever played so far
14952,"Best sim builder since Sim City 2!

Looking for an up to date sim builder with endless mods? look no further

14959,"Overall a lot of fun, i struggled to understand exactly what I was suppose to do because i kept finding myself stuck in the negative as I have never played a game similar before, but with a few resets, and a little bit of experimentation I figured it out, and am currently doing very well."

15020,Traffic sucks
15021,This game really makes you feel like you've taken on the position of city planner This is the best city-planning games out there and I definitely recommend it. This game/sim is a MUST-HAVE for any steam library and the community mods really make it AMAZING!
15022,Great Game!
15023,"thumb up
"
15024,e
15025,Really fun to create and customize your own city at your own pace.  Also i like how you can get tall building and build the map the way you want it to without the moa helping you at the start.  Also very easy to pick up and play.
15026,"Step 1: Start a city.
Step 2: Build the city.
Step 3: Struggle with traffic.
Step 4: Adjust everything to perfection.
Step 5: Take a quick pause to grab something from the kitchen.
Step 6: Come back to find lightning has struck your powerlines dead and your city has reverted back to the stone age. 
Step 7: Repeat.

Love it."
15027,"A satisfying game to strategize and slowly build up the infrastructure of an entire city. Alternatively, just activate the infinite money mode and go crazy with whatever."
15028,It is a really good game if you like simulators and like to run a city.
15029,Great game!
15030,great simulation game
15031,Very entertaining with endless possibilities. I like to make the city beautiful and enjoyable and then as if I abandoned it and let the entire infrastructure crash.
15032,"I don't know why  this game's rating is ""Very Positive"". It seems to me it's a hollowed out version of The Sims 2 town editor. Yawn."
15033,"Super cool Game I highly Recommend! Just Make sure you have a good rig with a MINIMUM of Requires a 64-bit processor and operating system

15034,"Berry nice, but literally unplayable without mods."
15035,"What a masterpiece! As a fan of many sim-type games, this is one of the best titles of the past decade IMO. It feels like you're playing the old classic Sim City games, but with a lot of additional building types and other options to help create whatever type of city you'd like. The Community Workshop keeps the game fresh by adding so many maps, buildings and other customizations. It's easy to find a new type of building or theme to add to an existing city.
There's also a ton of DLC - I'm just starting to get into a few, which adds new complexities and cool things to the game. Worth checking out if you're still one of the few who haven't played this title yet!"
15036,Addictive.
15037,"good booming town

15038,Good fun
15039,"Got this on sale. Seemed interesting, but I cannot get the paradox launcher to install.

15049,Love this game
15050,"its a good simulator there you can be mayor and make big citiez
"
15051,It Expands Your Creativity And Just The Mods Are Great
15052,"Yay steam just deleted my long review because I hit the ""no"" button after writing it...

This is a good game.  If you like this kind of thing, you'll want to buy and play it.  But I am giving a ""bad"" review because this game is majorly hyped up, but to me, it seems like it has a lot of annoyances that haven't ever been fixed, and I want to share that perspective to balance out the numerous good reviews.  

Btw, a similar game (in a lot of ways) is Factorio.  For example, conveyor belts are very similar to the idea of roads and traffic.  They both have train tracks, and both use ""splines"" (computing curves) for those train tracks.  However, despite being a very small company, Factorio does not have many of the issues I mention. 

1.  The game is extremely fiddly.  You can easily spend *several* hours trying to build an intersection because without making it huge, it's difficult to get the roads to do what you want.  Building reusable intersections in the editor is a MUST.  But because of that, you have to save and exit your game, which really disrupts the flow.   

2. Speaking of the editor, there's some issues.  First of all, it isn't smart enough to let you replace existing roads with your existing road.  So if you have an overpass, you must first demolish the highway, and then place it.  It often won't let you snap ends (train tracks seem to work but highways don't?) so you have to demolish extra, then try and carefully line up the roads so they aren't off kilter. 

3. The roads insist on snapping a certain way sometimes when connecting two roads.  This can force a perpendicular road to being like 86 degrees, which is enough to require demolishing buildings and creating distorted zones. 

4. Traffic is DUMB.  You'll have highway (bypass) traffic *waiting* in the right-hand (exit) lane, while the other two lanes are open.   Cars will stop before entering an empty roundabout.  All vehicles will try to use the preferred route, even though it's backed up off the visible map, when there's 3 open, unused exits.    I understand this is tricky, but it's surprisingly silly how willing the cars are to wait when there's open road all around them...

5. Without DLC, highways are 3 lanes, but  you can have 6 lane one way surface roads.  What?   The Mass Transit DLC gives you a 4 lane highway.

6. Traffic is too dumb to use parallel highway roads and/or ""express lanes"" or bypass belt ways.  

7.  A lot of the complaints in the reviews of DLCs hasn't been addressed even years later, even when they're minor issues that wouldn't take much time to fix.

8.  Dirt roads are surprisingly expensive, but also surprisingly good.  These ""service roads"" can be used for a very long time, and in certain edges, forever.  I would have made them MUCH cheaper, but unable to be zoned adjacent to (like highways). As is, the ""meta"" is to use dirt roads wherever you can for as long as you can.  HOWEVER, in certain circumstances, if you upgrade a dirt road to a paved road, it messed up the zoning (odd shapes and/or demolishing buildings). 

9.  No road with an ""easement.""  If you plan an expanded road (later) you can't zone it, unless you're ok demolishing buildings (very unrealistic).

10.  Some bodies of water are infinite, and some are easily dried.  One map, the entire river can be dried with a small ""village"" and a single water pump.  Other maps, a bit larger river can support a super city.  

11.  The game doesn't let you have parallel roads merge into a single wider road.  They must snap into the ""center"" and form an intersection.  In real life, it's common to have two, 2-lane roads come into a ""y"" and form a 4-lane road. 

12.  Traffic will stop before entering a completely empty roundabout.

13.  It's difficult and fiddly to place parallel roads.  Like I was trying to place a one way next to a large two way.  I gave up, because every cross road had to be turned into a weird intersection. The roads themselves ""fight"" being placed next to each other with snap points.

14.  I keep mentioning snap points.  You can toggle them on and off, which helps.  But even with them toggled off, roads still try to snap to endpoints and periodically placed ""length"" points. 

15.  I liked the idea of building in a hilly or mountainous area, but the automatic terrain leveling of roads and houses was ugly, kind of weird, and erratic. I'm talking about the ""embankments."" Especially problematic is if you place long lengths of road, it seems to be not smart enough to ""bend"" at the top or bottom of hills, and then you ended up with an elevated road with embankments on each side. 

16.  There's no undo button, and all the fiddly stuff really exacerbates the situation. Even if you bulldoze 1 second later, you still lose 25% of your money.  It's easy to chew through a lot of money if you aren't careful, with fiddly junk.   

17. Also related to not having an undo,  but if you do certain things in a certain order, they work.  But if you do them in a different order they don't work.  So you might accidently bulldoze something you didn't meant to, and find out you can't just put it back, because the overpass ramp you built is now ""in the way."" 

18.  The smallest possible roundabouts are massive.  Like, you can put 30 1 square houses inside them.  All of the exits in my neighborhood and outside my neighborhood are roundabouts, but if I tried to do that in Cities,  my  .3km neighborhood would be like 2km.

19.  No autosave?  Wtf.   It doesn't even prompt you to save when quitting.

20. ""Road too short"" and ""Road too steep"" errors when you know those are not true.  (Often related to ""works if you do A first then B,  but not B first then A). 

There is DLC that addresses some of these issues.  However, it shouldn't be up to modders to fix core mechanics of a game.  Especially because with time, every modder will move on in life, and the mod will eventually stop working.  Also, charging a lot for a DLC, then leaving it unfinished, or badly needing ""polish,"" is just bad practice.  It's not even like 1 or 2 of them, but half of the DLC has poor-ish reviews.  Even the ""mostly positive"" DLC, there's people making very good points about why it just isn't that good.  Things like more complicated mechanics resulting in less income than using basic mechanics, very small/incomplete mechanics for a whole DLC pack based around that mechanic, etc. 

I'm guessing a lot of the biggest fans play in ""sandbox"" mode with a bunch of mods to fix a lot of the issues.  But anyone who's piled a lot of mods up on the same game know that it can be very tricky to get them to work and for the game to be stable..."
15053,"This game gives you an  endless choice of options with all the different dlcs, assets and mods"
15054,Really fun and lots of mods to customize your experience but it does get a bit confusing at first when you are staring off. After sometime you will start to understand more and videos help a lot.
15055,its a great game to just let your mind wander and chill to its simple to learn
15056,e
15057,It's a very good game and i have been playing for 1 year on PC and xbox and the DLC and mods are really good
15058,"awesome shit
if you are into logistics this is definitely your game"
15059,23161
15060,its a very good game. the steam workshop really makes it
15061,Best city building game out there. Lots of great mods that make this game even better.
15062,it goodf
15063,"A great fun city building sim. Not as detailed management-wise as SimCity - it's more about design and building - you can make some really detailed and realistic cities. Money is easy to make. There's lots of DLC (which you have to pay for and it specific to certain parts of the game, like transport, industry, fishing etc), but it seems like you don't really need any of them to build a great city. Get them on sale!"
15064,West Taiwan expansion when?
15065,"I went to the bathroom and my citizens started a riot.
10/10"
15066,yes

15073,zippr0
15074,"It's very addictive and entertaining, you need to also use logic to play this game. Super good, I fell in love with it instantly"
15075,fun
15076,"I had to watch a tutorial to get the hang of it, but it becomes so much more fun in the end. The only thing that sucks is the camera control, I wish you could just drag around using left click like SimCity."
15077,Very fun
15078,"This game is really not a city building game.  There no mixed zoning, no alleyways, you have to unlock public transit... you cant even make a town that starts out of an industry... you have to unlock industry.  why would people live there if there wasn't industry?

This game is completely divorced from how cities are built; it should be called suburban skylines.  It may sound like I am nit-picking but at the core of this game is a perverted view of what cities really are and the gameplay suffers greatly due to it.  Its a real shame that the city building games have seen no real advancements to the core game-play after all these years.

People tell me its a great traffic manager but my boring grid cities with one way streets did fine.  maybe it gets more fun when you have to design 12 lane intersections the size of neighborhoods.  or you could play the likes of factorio/mini metro for that logistics itch."
15079,Nice game!!
15080,This is the best game iv'e ever played!!!!!!!!!!!!!
15081,Nice

15085,This is a really good good game but is pretty hard to do stuff in i recommend
15086,best city builder ever
15087,good
15088,This is a very relaxing game. Very fun to play. The only issue I have encountered and it's probably my own fault is I can never figure out the trash situation as my city gets bigger. No matter what I just can't seem to make sure trash pick up is efficient. (Probably user error and not the games fault) Other than that this is a great game to relax and just build a city and think about nothing other than serving your citizens.

15098,I may have played 336 hours but i still dont know how to make a functioning city
15099,"Get SimCity 4 instead of this one. It's not only cheaper, even when not on sale, but also still has an active mod community. Plus you won't have to deal with a third-party login. Nor Paradox's bad business model of spamming DLC content to the point that it becomes over priced.

If you want this game then wait till Paradox makes a complete edition, but even then wait a few years afterwords. Paradox is known to still release DLCs for so called content complete games afterwords just so they can milk people for money one last time. Don't fall for this scam like so many others have done in the past."

15105,"Professional workshop community. A bit of a money grab with the DLC's (+$200?) but ultimately worth the price. You can make some incredible things in this game as the skill-cap in this game is nearly infinite. Man's with physics degrees out here making tri-level highway turbines with precision lane planning. I'd approach the DLC's with more complexity to create a more realistic experience (they work decently; but common 5 types of warehouses? & no stock inland container yards? no garages? or truck yards/stops?)(Find it all in the community workshop) . I'd overlay a materials/resource import/export chart to provide a more comprehensive understanding and control over industrial processes of the city. 


TLDR: 89/100 
Simple yet complex. Must rely on aftermarket parts in order to achieve sought after results. Still provides a platform on which this can be done on."

15130,Yes this game is worth to buy and Paradox should propose this game to every single government in the world. so they can create cities with less traffic and high efficiency.

15134,"[h1]It is a great game, but you need a lot of money to add DLC in order to get more workshop items to work! (Please read from start to finish.)[/h1]

First to start off positive, now If there's a city game then can beat simcity then Cities: Skylines must be it. This is been developed by the Paradox Interactive in Sweden. It seems proved to become one of the most popular city building games. With great quality, easy tools, lots of workshop items and more. I know... It's a city of your dreams, I would enjoyed playing it for hours.

This game would be the great choice but there's ONLY one big problem on which could cursed less likely recommended to anyone... the price is unbelievably too expensive!

I think the base game is normally like around $30 USD or more, (unless on special promotion.) And If you try to download any items from workshop please note some items that you might need requires DLC to use it - most DLC content do cost and prices tags are not the same level like above and below $15 USD in each content. There are nearly 30 DLC contents and buying it altogether as a bundle option is roughly above $200!

So here Paradox can be a ripoff even if you're not lucky. (In other words, not quite wealthy enough!) So when playing the game and getting more content be careful of spending too much.
On the bright side the city building game is excellent and would recommended others to play it, but on the other side, maybe not with too many DLC Content with a high price tag, I'm disappointed with that result (but not all.) and that is my opinion, although I can still play it...

Note: I won't recommended yet and that's until there is hope that could change/fix things. If you already have the game you can still feel free on playing it but as I said before do be careful when spending the DLCS!

Oh, and this is my first review on any game, and thanks for reading it."
15135,"dont havbe tje time, brain, and money to learn and play. thats just me though"
15136,"excellent game, be prepared to spend alot of time playing"
15137,"Excellent, immersive and very detailed variation of a city builder, one of the best available, if not THE best when you consider the available community content and DLC."
15138,"Simply said, this is a fun game."
15139,Fun relaxing game. Allows you to build the city of your dreams.
15140,Very good!
15141,Fun for like 4 hours and then it's just traffic jams
15142,I cannot physically make a normal city. Every time I have an urge to turn on cheats and flood every town I make with sewage
15143,"Nice game if you like to build citites. It is really detailed, but is not that fun unless you unlock all the DLC's which just make the overall experience that much better. Would highly praise this game to anyone who enjoys city building games."
15144,this game fantastic just i love this game

15153,"For players, who love simulation this is great, lots of workshop items to enhance player experience."
15154,"I never write these or rate games... I went out on a whim and bought this game (along with several of it's DLCs) because the sales were so good that day... I DO NOT REGRET! This game is soooooo addicting and fun to watch how cities develop/progress overtime. The graphics are beautiful and it is quite user friendly overall. However, the game can be difficult and there is a bit of a learning curve when it comes to developing a well-rounded city and it becomes progressively more difficult as you develop towards a metropolis+. Mods make the customization soooooo much more enjoyable, even for the Vanilla base game. With that being said, the DLC content MAKES this game WORK... without any DLCs you may find yourself going ""hmm, theres something missing here..."" Overall, if you like the idea of building you own city road by road and managing it, with beautiful graphics/details (even down to the Cims - citizens in the game), then this is the game for you!!!! Buy the DLCs when they're on sale too!"
15155,👌👍

This is by far one of the most addicting games I've ever played. To me, it's neck and neck with Red Dead Redemption 2 as far as the level of interactive tasks and objectives. There's [b] so much [/b] to do in this game that I've spent nearly [u] 600 hours [/u] on it (263Hrs on Steam + 328Hrs on XBox).

15157,"i build highways and cities that have worse traffic than the 401, DVP and gardiner combined"
15158,fun
15159,"When I first got it I heralded it as a Sim City killer and a big middle finger to EA for their terrible policies. But the honeymoon is long over and revisiting it now served no purpose other than to make me deeply regret that foolish optimism.Sad, there is a good game buried here. Like many theoretically good games it is just sad to look at the petty, minor things that manage to kill it. 

Outside of the obligatory (but completely valid) complaining about Paradox's DLC policies, when I first got it I had a machine built in 2011. While most games up to 2015 still ran okay on that computer, I didn't think much of the performance issues at the time even though lowering graphical settings did little to assuage its ridiculous CPU usage. 

But that old machine died (F) and now I have a new one. Now, on a much more recent machine it still chugs and stammers. 

So I ran a few experiments of CPU usage and I will give an average for each one. 

Stellaris, another paradox game released a year after City Skylines
3% CPU : 1,000 MBs of memory

Battlefleet Gothic: Armada II, a game released five years after City Skylines
15% CPU : 1,800 MBs of memory

Dwarf Fortress... during world creation, max age and size
18% CPU : 2,000 MBs of memory

City Skylines
35% CPU : 4,000 MBs of memory : 

This seems to stem from two things. Poor optimization and I have a terrible internet connection, and this game apparently loves harvesting data. That alone is a hard uninstall but because it has to communicate over the net it would occasionally stutter when my high latency satellite internet reminded it why I seldom play multiplayer games online and why ""always connected"" is code word for ""Well fuck you too"" in my world.

You know, the reason I -didn't- buy EA's contemporary Simcity game. 

There is other more minor quibbles. The traffic system could use a bit more polish with traffic at least visually not using every lane available to them and hopefully not mechanically, this should be strictly called a European City Builder because almost everything is a public service from health care to public transportation which I know this might shock the average Swede is not how most of the world works, and slightly related not all farms are factory farms. When I heard you could put in farmland I was expecting rolling acres of wheat or pasture with homesteads creating some sort of idyllic scenery on the outskirts of my city and instead its all animal torture facilities. Then we question why the middle class is dying.

That's all small potatoes compared to the first three things. Unoptimized memory killing, data harvesting, and to a slightly smaller extent the usual DLC policy which isn't as bad here as it is for games like Europa Universalis IV or Crusader Kings II"

15191,give me money for my review
15192,focused on a traffic jam so much i forgot to make healthcare available 10/10
15193,"Are there many real-world examples of farm area main buildings producing a lot of trash and attracting criminals? There's something sinister going on in here. Maybe an agenda against the agricultural capitalist?

Excellent game all over. I recommend this strongly to anyone who wants to learn planning, decorating, design - and also for those who like a relaxing game. 

Check out the workshop too, it's just great - but be aware that not everything on there is completely functional. Read the descriptions and comments to avoid hassle.

By the way: the Campus DLC seems to be crap functionally. The buildings look great and it's fun to set the thing up, but the students will not appear at the same rate as with vanilla universities. In other words: micromanaging for no particular gain (unless a good-looking city is your only aim)."

15256,"After Playing Cities Skylines for 7 years, as of recent I've been playing Fresh install No DLC no Mods, No Assets. Whats the point of playing if it crashes the entire game with no file error message? After playing 7 years Cities has continued to lack in fixing its ram and cpu rendering graphics program causing many headaches for pc gaming users worldwide and the long lag of loading the game. Sad to say but I'm uninstalling Cities and won't be playing for sometime until cities does a mass overhaul on its game launcher settings. Thank you for the years of memories while building cities. Onward to other city building games for now. Hopefully you guys in development software will see this as just simple feedback, and actually fix these issues? The game should not crash with no mods, assets, or DLCs enabled, If a standalone gamer can build Ostriv with wonderful graphics and promises what Cities should be upholding is a question to consider, Why cant Cities function like it should?... until then bye for now Cities skylines. Again, Thank you :) 

Maybe one day I'll return to Cities hoping it upholds to its standards and loading times are fixed by then"

It’s a really impressive and often beautiful simulation, where an amazing number of virtual people go about their business across a huge swath of land. Getting in and creating something is easy, though mastering it will require extensive research on community wikis to understand why growth is stunted even when you address your citizens’ apparent concerns."
15270,Great game with some fantastic mods to enhance game play even further. Sim City is knocked out of the City Park by this game. 10/10

- Fun Game
- Realistic City-planning aspects
- Good Music ;) (Gold FM)

- Requires a quite good PC to run smoothly

Despite the Cons I can still very much recommend Cities:Skylines."

15288,Great Game i would recommend
15289,very cool
15290,"i love making dystopia 
"
15291,"I've really tried to like this game but everything about it is so antagonistic in its design.

The tutorials are awful so you have to go to youtube videos and rely on third party content to even figure out how to do the most basic of things.

The game is riddled with bugs and insane water physics that will wipe your city with the slightest mistake, so ensure you save literally constantly, like every minute on the minute, or else you're just fucked.

After playing hours of this god damn game between this and the epic version (I have the epic version as well since I got it for free, but then found out that the steam workshop is where all the good mods are for some reason, the Nexus mods are lacking all of the important additions) I'm probably around 10 or so hours and I feel like I have not only wasted 10 hours of my life but also taken years off of my lifespan.

At no point have I had any lasting amount of fun with this game. Any fun I did have was short lived and immediately snuffed out by a mechanic that barely functioned as intended or outright broke and bugged.

The straw that broke the camel's back was spending hours pain-stakingly perfecting a city's layout in a way that I liked with clear and precise districts that looked pretty and thanks to mods didn't have ugly power lines jammed awkwardly into each section. Finally, I had a city that I could enjoy. Until I had the audacity to build a hydro-electric dam so far down river from my city that I had to dag the camera multiple times to place power lines on the way there. The water physics promptly bugged out (I mean like catastrophically, at one point I could see the river bed and there was a split that looked like Mosses had personally split this body of water just to kill my city with waves so high I had to pan my camera out just to see what was happening) and what can only be described as 50ft walls of water (which were comically large for the body of water they came from...) devastated my city and then proceeded to pool up and ruin all my residential and commercial district.

I wish I hadn't let this sit in my library for so long and that I hadn't gone over the 2 hour mark because I desperately want to refund this game. This has been such a let down after playing games like Sim City. My girlfriend likes this game and to be honest the DLC does seem to add a lot, but the base game offers nothing I am looking for and to me that means I shouldn't invest any more than the money I've already wasted. It is not chill or relaxing, it is stressful and annoying at best.

Also, what genius thought it was a good idea to have that stupid bird with no way to turn it off? Thank god for whoever modded that out, you are a saint and have foresight that the devs couldn't even muster 7 years after their game's release.

Yes, this is a bit of a rage rant and somewhat of a vent, but no, these points don't become any less valid when I'm not freshly livid from a bug destroying my 20th attempt to enjoy this game.

Paradox games' business model is already terrible and predatory as it is with their gross amounts of DLC and their bare bones base game, selling the rest of the game to you piece meal bit by bit, for a couple hundred dollars. Frankly, I have no idea what possessed me to buy this game in the first place with that kind of business model, but congrats Paradox, you get to keep my money."
15292,Nice game ^^
15293,Fantastic game! I love it!
15294,GOOD
15295,yes
15296,Fiddly and fun.  You can spend hours being creative with this game.
15297,"is good game, the workshop feature needs improvement as its too easy to break the game with mods"
15298,cool apart from the retarded traffic
15299,Probably the best city builder I've played. DLC isn't needed but adds a lot to the game and can some fix problems you may have in your city. Also has a workshop with great mods from the community.
15300,"The only thing I wish was different is the inability to terraform your city before starting it.
The transportation options are super fun, and the natural resources assignment to industrial ares was a really good idea."
15301,well ive played for 100 hours so yea is good
15302,The real SimCity.
15303,Excellent strategy-building game! Totally recommend.
15304,haha cities go brrrrrrrrrrrr
15305,good
15306,good game
15307,"dear Paradox
I hope all of your families pass away tonight."
15308,good good
15309,"It's a very comprehensive city simulator with an abundant and vibrant community of modders, so your city can go from the basic versions CO provides to having something with immense depth and character similar in many ways to what you see when you drive down the streets in your home town."
15310,"good game, but cant do shit without A$320+ worth of DLC."
15311,good game
15312,n
15313,yeah
15314,"I love this game. I've put in 160 hours so far and I can see myself putting so many more into it. 

There are plenty of upsides, and downsides.

Upsides - 
This game has a great community for everything. If you ever need help with anything, looking into youtube is  a great tool. (I've had to do this for a lot of things.) I know there are also plenty of Discord servers where you can get help. There is also an amazing Steam community as well.

There are hundreds of thousands of mods and assets to make this game much more in depth and enjoyable. And more are always being made all the time. I can assure you, there is a collection of mods for anyone, and everything, with every play style thinkable. Do not be afraid to explore these as you just might find something to put hundreds of thousands of hours into.

This game is extremely in depth. There is always something to do. Not to mention the amount of possibilities for amazing cities and landscapes. I've seen AMAZING creations in this game, not to mention some people actually get over 1,000,000 citizens. I personally haven't even reached the last mark yet! But regardless of such, this game has amazing possibilities for creativity.

Downsides -

Now honestly I can't think of much, but there are a few thing that honestly I wish where base game, and not a mod. The largest thing that personally gets me, and keep in mind this is just me, is that there are some networking things that could be improved for better design. This eliminates the uses of certain mods. 

If you like symmetrical building, its not the easiest feat to complete base game. If you want true symmetry, you'll need mods beyond the shadow of the doubt. Trying to get a hold of perfect curves for freeway exits feels almost impossible.

There are a few other things that I could nitpick, but there's nothing that the community can't solve. Trust me, if you like the idea of being able to build an empire, you'll enjoy this game. Just make sure you know what you're doing, or else you'll just end up in the bedrock broke beyond belief."
15315,This shit is fun. The workshop Mods make it way better though.
15316,Addictive fun!
15317,yes
15318,It gives me an erection
15319,Fun game when you get used to it (In my opinion)
15320,Great game that allows so much flexibility and creativity
15321,cool
15322,u think u got a good pc? try running this without any problems with 1500 asstes downloaded. i bet 10 bucks.
15323,Hours of entertainment! build your best city (or worst) and see what you can make! Vanilla game is fun but mod it for the ultimate experience.
15324,GREAT GAME
15325,big city good game
15326,It's alright
15327,"City builder games just kind of work for me. I don't like fiction. I find it to be very disturbing. If you ask me, characters are for bad characters. I don't do characters. I thought that Microsoft Flight Simulator would've worked for me, but I'd rather get a private pilot certificate and actually fly than play that game. I liked SimCity 3000 and 4 when I was younger, but Cities: Skylines hits the right notes for me with its focus on community and modding. I do feel as though it has run its course, though. Colossal Order, the developer of Cities: Skylines, has a new project in the works. Only time will what it is. 

Colossal Order has made a sensible public statement that it will not update the engine to Cities: Skylines. From what I've seen, the Unity that existed when this game was in development and the Unity that now exists are very different. Also, Cities: Skylines had a low budget. It was publicly stated that the budget of the later expansions were the budget of the base game prior to launch. Colossal Order is now at nearly 30 employees and I can't wait to see what it'll come up with next.

If you're like me, then you want all the mods and all the assets for Cities: Skylines. Your game won't work that way, though. Be selective in what you subscribe to and respect your system's hardware configuration.

I like the game, but I feel that it could be so much more. A mod was being worked on 5 or 6 years ago to expand the 4x4 zoning implementation. That mod was never released. Colossal Order has hired modders who worked on this game, including the modder who was working on the mod to expand the 4x4 zoning implementation.

I have mixed feelings about this game. For me, this is the game that keeps on giving because people keep churning out great content for it. It was riding SimCity 2013's coattails, though. It's a blatant copy of SimCity 2013. Was legal action ever threatened? I have no idea.

Ultimately, I like this game. I want to see what the next one is, though."
15328,"A very good game that enjoyable.
You could actually enjoy the game in vanilla mode without any specific workshop mod that you need."
15329,Very good game for making cinematic and city planninig.
15330,hndgf
15331,poop
15332,Cool
15333,best game of all time hands down
15334,C I T I E S
15335,the open comuty make this a wonderful game
15336,haha artillery go boom boom
15337,yes
15338,Great combination of strategy and creativity in a game. I've always loved the Sim City series and this game is very similar in the best way.
15339,Fun game that makes you create your dream city!
15340,Super fun city sim!
15341,Phyhn
15342,"Wasn't into city builders before I saw this game, nothing comes close to it in this genre. The sky is the limit in terms of how big and beautiful you want your city to be. I got nearly a thousand hours in it and I'm just getting started!"
15343,"with this game you can build towns and cities alike, and then later have crime problems and fires and the ability to nuke your towns

become a dictator and nuke your city

be a mayor and nuke your city

nuke your city

please"
15344,this game is so good that you can build the city of your dreams no matter how bad it is its your opinoin on how you like your city espaclially with the natural disaster you can test it
15345,"Even though C:S was launched more than five years ago, 
thanks to the Great Community of assets Creators and Modders on the Steam Workshop, 
it is still a game that surprises with new abilities 
and I've got a huge fun playing this.
9.9/10"
15346,Better than SimCity
15347,good game
15348,"make traffic jam then, fix traffic jam and realize traffic jam is now somewhere else"
15349,this game is fun
15350,"Generaly perfect game!
"
15351,It's so cool.
15352,"The base vanilla game is fun for a little bit but needs all DLCs in my opinion to be enjoyable. If you have a good computer, modding the game unlocks so much potential of what you can do to design your city. You can really do A LOT, and just about anything you want is in the workshop. Pretty awesome community too"
15353,Great game.

15378,Great
15379,"Endless fun, thanks Paradox."
15380,meh
15381,"I've logged 2,827 hours. That's how much I love this game."
15382,"По-моему, лучший из многих симуляторов и конструкторов городов и очень рад, что проект живёт и развивается."
15383,cool
15384,The best city sim I've ever played. So in depth.
15385,Pretty fun game... Gets boring after a while so get the extra landscaping tools it makes the game more fun with rping and stuff you can make big tsunamis and floods better than the disaster pack!
15386,"Love this game. It's honestly VERY easy to get sucked in, but it's worth it. I'd recommend the park life, mass transit and industries DLC's, yet there are other decent ones so make sure to check them out. Also mods are a MUST. Different mods suit different players but definitely check out the workshop."
15387,This game is good. Play it.
15388,Хороший симулятор строительства города.
15389,do not order the PC version
15390,good game
15391,"A very relaxing gaming experience, with a smooth gameplay and a very realistic dynamic to it. For those whose favorite game type is game/city-building, this is the best option in the market right now."
15392,You need to play this game if you into building city simulator game.
15393,city
15394,"Wonderful game, can often find yourself loosing track of just how many hours you've been playing. The game's varied selection of DLC's and easily downloadable mods offer an incredibly diverse array of assets and add-ons which can be used to improve the look and function of your city."
15395,"Fantastic game, so good i forgot to pick up the kids and feed myself"
15396,"Had played long before i bought it, it was somewhat satisfying to see how the small quirky little town you created grow to a landscape of lights.

It has issues but most of it can be alleviate by mods though it you will still experience issues on the mods itself but if you install a few handful i doubt you'll have bad time. 
 
Vanilla is playable but if you are picky about what would it look like then you need mods. i don't recommend buying it for full price especially the collection, some of them you don't really need unless you want them. 

Buy them at sale, other than that its quite fun. hopefully when they release a newer version of this game they'll fix or add what is lacking in the vanilla game."
15397,great game
15398,"I am total beginner, but loving it."
15399,"i like game, fun build, cpu go sad tho"
15400,1
15401,yUh
15402,"This game does what it's supposed to. Build your own city, as long as you make it like 100 others. If that's what you want, this game delivers. But as someone sick of Society, this became a reminder of how powerless we are to do anything but follow ""the rules."" I get more satisfaction daydreaming about the community i'd like to help build. Where's the heart?"
15403,I liked the city building
15404,bueno
15405,This game is everything Sim City should have been and more; it's now THE city simulator by which all others should be judged.
15406,Absolutely LOVE this game!! I cannot get enough of it!!
15407,"This is what a City Builder should be. The base game is rather bland but there is so much you can do to customize, and with mods from the Steam community it's just always gets better. I own most of the expansion packs and they are def worth it if your into this game. They add a lot of new elements to your city and they are designed to function as intended in your city as well instead of being essentially just fancy props like most mods are. There are a few funny things to get used to about building roads on the terrain, but overall if you get creative you can even cover it up at times. Look up the Mods for traffic control and to unlock all tiles as you can then build anywhere on the map and also get control of the entire region. There are even more mods to customize further and even choose and place buildings anywhere you want. Highly recommended over the other competition city builders any day."
15408,awwwwwwwwsome
15409,"Fun

15420,Its fun though. Worth it
15421,"Really Good Simulator - best of its kind at the moment for city building, Many Mods to keep you entertained."
15422,"Отличная игра! Чисто на расслабоне отвлечься самое то, ничего не надо, потихонбку делаешь свою деревню)"
15423,The best City Builder
15424,"Excellent game, let your imagination run wild!"
15425,big addiction
15426,cities go brr
15427,8)
15428,"Great game with tons of detail and keeping it fun. I had some issues starting and running out of money, I probably started a new game 10 times to fix all of the issues I kept making before getting on track to having a city scape that runs between several zones with a good positive cash flow"
15429,Creating for hours
15430,Good city builder
15431,"Very fun and immersive city building simulator. Easy to get into while also having enough complexity to never get bored. DLC will mostly add to creativeness and things to do, unfortunately I do not have all the DLC right now so i can only speak about Park Life, which is an amazing DLC add on."
15432,I love this game. Spent over 100 hours on it so far and wouldn't take a single one back. Great city building game.
15433,My favourite city builder game
15434,"It's my favourite game.
"
15435,"If you like strategic games, this one is really good !"
15436,Uga boga. City is poo
15437,"Relaxing and structured in a way that growth = difficulty. Clean UI, great music, and tons of ways to expand with all the DLC. Worthy successor to SimCity."
15438,
15439,"It very relaxing building your roads and watching your city grow. I have no DLCs or mods.  All I know how to do is build roads and set zones and I only learned today how to check on traffic routes. I will not be getting bored of this soon plus I can learn about districts and other features I have not yet used. I'm also already looking at what DLCs I want because the game is so good. 

I've seen some amazing cities on YouTube. This game can be as simple or as challenging as you like.  

I initially got this game for free with ps plus. I enjoyed it so much and thought it would suit me better playing on pc so i bought it here. I have no regrets buying something I already owned"
15440,"Very Addictive, Its incredibly satisfying building a well functioning city"
15441,"Gets old real quick, not a lot of stuff to do"
15442,"Looks great, and plays... just okay. 

You won't be able to build subways as intended, and good luck with bridge building or overpasses. Despite the feature being ""present"" it won't actually let you do it. So everything will need to be on the same level. Not particularly efficient if you ask me."
15443,"If you loved SimCity 4 and other city building games, you must get this."
15444,1
15445,"Great game, lots of fun."
15446,"This game has a very real life feel to it. It is equally complicated. If you like designing cities, you will love it. But there is also a lot of management that goes along with a city. That is part of what makes it so great to play. Also, i figured out how to have unlimited money in the game. That makes it so much easier for a beginner. I also watch youtube videos of people who play the game to learn more about how to build a good city."
15447,good
15448,A very nice game，I like it so much.
15449,"I haven't touched the game in a while, and now nothing works, the game crashes, and I have no idea what's going on. What happened?"
15450,"Bad:   Microtransactions
Good: Gameplay

Good game but come one, mini DLC's, this is worse than an EA multiplayer game. I only have vanilla game, no DLC, still good enough. Buy it if you want. 
(Got it from Humble Bundle sub)"
15451,"Better than SimCity... So...
Not worth spending your money, but if it gets really cheap on eneba.com or just you got free weekend on epic games etc..."
15452,This game is really good however it's not recommend for low end pcs with under 8gb of RAM because a lot of the assets used in the game are really laggy (High tris count)
15453,Amazing
15454,"good
"
15455,its fun
15456,"If you used to play Sim City and you enjoy that genre, this game is definitely for you."
15457,am construction engineer now
15458,"A great game with fantastic workshop compatibility and developer mod support. 

Cities: Skylines has furthered my love and desire to create worlds of my own while granting me limitless opportunities to build my vision of the perfect city. Cities: Skylines would not be where it is today, nor would I still be playing it as often as I do, if it weren't for the amazing workshop community and support from developers who actively promote mod creators. 

Cities: Skylines has continued to feature DLC updates which add game changing features such as the introduction of more public transportation, map additions, natural disasters, different climates, etc. Playability with these DLC updates are fun and exciting, and I would highly recommend investing some thought into some of the major updates if given the chance (Sunset Harbor, After Dark, Industries, Mass Transit).

I've put countless hours into this game, spending nearly every night creating the city I strictly envision. Watching my creativity flow from mind to map has been wonderful."
15459,me likey poop water traffic game
15460,"Good, but too much dlc. They need to be bigger and most should just be free updates to keep people intrested, like seriously over 100 bucks for dlc? This isnt the sims 3."
15461,Very Fun and Chill Game its quite easy to pick up but have heard from people its hard for some reason. Would Recommend
15462,best bro
15463,"One of the best city simulator games I've ever played. Years after first downloading it, I'm still playing it. Highly recommended!"
15464,"I love this game in general especially with mods because it helps you do more things in the game itself than with no mods. The thing that i dislike about this game is that traffic is very stupid since you put a street with 4lanes they just only get on 2lanes instead of all four you guys should make that car bots be better and have a a better AI traffic since is very frustrating bc what is the point on having to much lanes if they just grab like 1 or 2 they don't really care and do traffic in 1 or 2 lanes, depends on how much lanes does it have. Thats the only and the biggest issues that this game have. But the rest i love it very, very much! :D
"
15465,Best quality game :)
15466,if my mods can load i'll play
15467,"Paradox changed their privacy policy since I bought the game, and now I can't even launch it without consenting to data harvesting."
15468,"nigga 
"
15469,Fun way to kill time
15470,"Strongly recommended, this game has no end. The idea of create a completely functional City without limits is perfect. 100% recommendable. Hours spend in this game will train your strategic and analytical thinking."
15471,"Best city building game I ever played. I played it for over 400 hours, thus, I find it amazing!"
15472,My life has been on a decrees since playing this game
15473,When this one be on sale?
15474,"Great City building game, could use some bug fixes and quality of life updates tho."

15487,it is so addictive
15488,"Cities: Skylines feels much more ""real"" than other city simulators I've played. If you're a fan of this type of game, you'll love it."
15489,fine mechanically but the only cities you can make look like gigantic open air ikeas
15490,"sehr schönes spiel um sich die Zeit zu vertreiben, man kann Stunden in dem Spiel lassen"
15491,It's awesome
15492,100% Recommended
15493,Loved Sim City... wow is Cities Skylines so much more involved. Takes a bit of getting used to but works great on my M1 Mac Mini (surprised). It gets addicting quick. There's always something to do in this game it seems

15497,yeee
15498,great game
15499,"Base game is okey-ish, but with mods and assets this game can become work of art for creative people. Don't rush with buying all DLC's, some are not worth it, just use mods."
15500,"This game is awesome. Only thing is to make sure you have good graphics before you try to play or it might not run. Other than that, amazing game."
15501,Fliping awsome!
15502,"There really isn't an end to the game, other than you as the player making your city exactly as you want it, and running as efficient as possible. its a long game. good luck"
15503,It's a great city build games but traffic quickly becomes hard to manage and the DLC prices are fucking absurd.
15504,Gg
15505,very fun game
15506,"Overall the best game of the year and I really like the style, I would also like it if every single cool feature wasn't a DLC."
15507,
15508,Probably the best city-building game since SimCity 2000.
15509,"Held off on playing this too long because I thought it might get overwhelming like some other sim games lately. I really shouldn't have. This game is very addictive and a lot of fun, easy to screw up at the beginning but you'll stumble along far enough to get hooked and then go online to find tips on what you should have done instead."
15510,good sim
15511,👍
15512,"A nicely executed building game, visuals are good and the level of detail is very high
some cons:
- No undo so when you build something and it auto-bulldozes other stuff, you have to either live with it or load an earlier save
- You can make mistakes easily without the game really notifying you like unintentionally break the power supply
- While it is good that mechanics are introduced one by one, you often only notice afterwards that your city has flaws that cannot be corrected and you have to start over
Overall, a little too complex and too hard to control for me but if one is to spend some more hours to getting the hang of this game it sure offers lots of depth and variety."
15513,hi
15514,"I got to the point where I started to independently learn how roads work and their real world uses just to make better cities. Highly addicting. You learn a lot every city you build and you roll that experience into the next one, each getting better and better. Get mods, they change your life. Highly recommend the Move It mod."
15515,very fun and well made many mods
15516,Pog
15517,great game
15518,It's an amaizing city building simulator game
15519,Building
15520,"It is what us old heads dreamed Sim City could be like, and then some."
15521,Good game
15522,spent too much on the dlcs
15523,"Its simple. The best game out there, along withe state of decays"
15524,
15525,This is a fun game. watch some videos to learn more about the game mechanics. Have blast. P.S. most mods are free. Traffic mod is a must.
15526,e
15527,"building ""low income areas"" and bombing them with meteors is how i relieve stress"
15528,"Easy to get in to and hugely moddable. Great playability, enjoyable, entertaining. I was a dedicated Sim City 4 player for 15 years before switching to Cities Skylines and it's a huge improvement. Haven't played SImCity or Citystate but if you've read that Cities Skylines is better it probably is!"
15529,it is good with a beefy computer
15530,Simply the best city builder available.
15531,good game
15532,Fecal matter in the water and the streets. I am greatest leader.
15533,"I just want to start and say that this game has helped me cope with stress and long days. There's nothing better than a chill session building your dream city. Anywho, enough about me. First and foremost, this game is the perfect example of game that is 10x better WITH mods. Paradox has done an amazing job with the framework of the game to allow modders and asset creators the opportunity to produce quality content. I STRONGLY recommend browsing steam workshop for custom content as it just makes your experience so much more enjoyable. Of course, the game is great without mods but there are quite a few quirks that base game has like limits on traffic rules/restrictions, lane adjustments and traffic management. a lot of your mod choices will be quality of life improvements like these so don't worry too much about if you PC can handle mods. I have a mid range PC (Ryxen 3600 with an RTX 2060 and 16GB RAM) and i have nearly 300 combined assets and mods and it runs great. This game is CPU-heavy (like many other simulation games) so if you're waning to build a PC based on simulation-type games, invest in a Decent CPU. After almost 200 hours i can truly recommend this game for those who are passionate about building sprawling cities, future city planners, design geniuses and anyone alike. If you have a creative side to you, you will love this game."
15534,oof ouch my traffic flow
15535,great game but takes 15-30 min to load on my pc
15536,"Poorly optimised, bloated with DLC, Paradox are notoriously greedy scum who should be avoided. The game itself is pretty boring, nothing you do feels like it has any effect on your city, all you can really do is expand your city, you can't really fail unless you're actively trying to fail. Avoid, get Tropico 6 (on sale) instead."
15537,Good game
15538,The start is boring but when you have a big city its great to expand and build your own infrastructere
15539,"best city building sim on steam with a great community and lots and lots of content
"
15540,Traffic! 10/10
15541,hurt brain
15542,"NEVER SEEN ANYTHING LIKE THIIS BEFORE
"
15543,"Fantastic game. Absolute enjoying the complexity and struggle. The only thing is that I think that some DLCs are a bit overprices, for what you actually do get."
15544,the more you play the more you find
15545,"This game was fun for the first few hours but then I ran into not really being able to add anything new to my city with the vanilla version. Only grab the game on a sale with a few extra DLCs, otherwise it will not be worth your money."
15546,"Most busin' simulation game I been had in a minute blood...





ABSOLUTELY CRACKING"
15547,¯\_( ͡👁 ͜ʖ ͡👁)_/¯
15548,LOVE! Hours of enjoyment!
15549,its pretty much the best city building game
15550,"kinda annoying that you need to buy so many DLCs for the full game, still super good tho"
15551,Great game to play if you're buzzed on blow.
15552,"It's a good game. Just don't download too many mods, or it will become unplayable."
15553,"Great Game! Loved the Sim City games, but this is much better."
15554,Imagine SimCity but THICC
15555,I would choose this game over crack cocaine!
15556,best city builder game period
15557,Good.
15558,One of the best city sims out there.
15559,good
15560,"Good City Builder. You can build large cities. Solve complex problems, balance out economics of what, how and when. recommended!"
15561,no
15562,The only game I will spend hours listening to the requests of the people to only to eventually get annoyed and launch every natural disaster I can at once. And so the cycle starts again
15563,What sim city should have been.  This game gets better by the year.
15564,Started playing this for the first time today and have had a blast.  The game really sucks you in and offers a lot of variety and things to do/look at to manage your city.  Definitely recommend if you're looking for a good casual city building experience.
15565,"Relax and also headache for organizing your city.
"
15566,The bible doesn't say anything about not drowning your town in a sewage volcano.
15567,fun
15568,gud. love graphics and designs. Very good game.
15569,Great game. idk what else to say but that it's great.
15570,h
15571,"Definitely very fun to just hop on and build without limitations, mods are great too."
15572,umm ok
15573,I love simulation games and I quite enjoy it! Kinda addicting >><<
15574,Its a fun game
15575,its good
15576,cool
15577,
15578,diskon plis
15579,"[b] Good Game, [/b] but loading takes long and often lags In-Game."
15580,gg
15581,"As an old Sim City player, this game is like taking Sim City and advancing it by a magnitude of 100%.  Well Done Dev Team."
15582,"It's chill and fun.  You can get deep into it, or you can just play around.  Community is great.  You really can't go wrong."
15583,"I really like the endless creativity that this game entails, whether you play vanilla or with mods/assets."
15584,"Great game, better than SimCity 4 for me."
15585,almost 200 mods kinda fucked my game
15586,💀
15587,crazy fun stuff
15588,its fun
15589,this game is fun and creative
15590,literally cant stop playing. nothing else needs to be said.
15591,Great City Building Game 10/10 first dlc you should get is either parklife or industries
15592,I love this game. It is the top leader in city building games and it will be for a long time.
15593,"This game is rad, 100% worth getting it at least to try.


Play for a while without mods until you understand what changes you want made. Then install a bunch of mods to make the game better, namely a traffic AI mod. They way traffic work work is when the cars spawn they choose the shortest distance to their destination and then try to stay in the correct lane they need for the need of the trip. So if there's a left turn at the very end of the trip the car will try to stay in the left lane even if it has to make a bunch of right turns first. They also don't act as if they live in the city, choosing sub-optimal routes because they know traffic will be bad. This can all be managed in vanilla but your city will not look pretty.




"
15594,really great community support
15595,One of the best games I have ever seen when it comes to building cities. Absolutely realistic and impressive. I absolutely recommend it! A big shoutout to Paradox!
15596,If you like the older SimCity games. This is a must!
15597,too easy
15598,"This game is fun and challenging at the same time! Whether you mod the game to get unlimited money and have a easy time, or you play on the hardest difficulty I'm sure you will have a blast playing this awesome game!"
15599,its ok
15600,"good city builder, roads included in-game"
15601,the game where you can draw cities. where the brush is your mouse cursor..
15602,"Easy to play, yet complex enough to keep you drawn in.  There are so many objectives and facets of the game you will get lost in time. 
 While playing you look up and hours have passed."
15603,"After playing for 1000 hours, I guess I can say that it is great fun, with the simple caveat that you absolutely MUST use mods to fully flesh out your city. If you love building infrastructure, this WILL drain your life in a good way."
15604,"Is a fun challenging experience. City creation can only be described as a chaotic mess of sweat and tears, managing a plethora of traffic on a scale never before seen. For me, its enigmatic at best. Once the city got over 70k population, traffic started becoming a nightmare. Slowly I managed to sort it out, now I'm working on getting my first monument running."
15605,10/10
15606,"This game is very fun. A lot of games are. But, in this game, there is no pressure and you can actually learn a lot of things from this game. I'd recommend it to other people."
15607,"j,asdkjhaskujdha"
15608,Very good game/simulator
15609,good
15610,"fah
"
15611,"This is a very satisfying game, It will take sometime to learn what is wrong and right for your creation. Sometimes its just a simple build, but soon it'll become more complicated. I've only scratched the surface of what I'm going to be doing in the future with my playthrough. Having the DLC greatly increases the vanilla gameplay, but It's still fine without them. It's real relaxing and satisfying to build some many different cities."
15612,begging for a sequel.
15613,"its just the best city building game I've ever played, takes a a bit to get used to controls and all the little features but once you do its amazing to do whatever you like in it and design any city you can imagine. Would recommend, DLC's are also very worth it."
15614,Great game! Learn about traffic management or you'll pay for it.
15615,UUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUU
15616,fun
15617,"The game is alright, but the pricing model is a total ripoff (as it always seems to be with Paradox games). The base game (30 dollars) is lacking in content, and all of the content its missing is locked behind additional 15ish dollar paywalls. Just pirate it at that point.

Also, who in their right mind would pay 5 bucks for a radio pack when you can just put music on in another tab

(I do genuinely enjoy playing the game but seriously, screw Paradox)"
15618,"I can finally recreate Flint, Michigan!"
15619,mod anarchy FRWEEDOM
15620,sys
15621,I LOVE IT
15622,dick
15623,Paradox Interactive > Electronic Arts
15624,Overall very fun but you need DLCs to play
15625,"What can I say...  I have this game on more than one Steam account between the 2 accounts I've played over 1000 hours.  I've owned it though since release day and thoroughly enjoy the game and with mods you can do so much more than the base game.  Only negative is the game can lag as your population grows this of course is worse if you have an older, or under powered PC but does happen to everyone regardless eventually for some it may be around population 100K and others 700K.  This game is a simulation beast and eats the resources.  Though that is why its a good game.

Do I recommend it?  Yes, a million times yes, if you like city builders you should own this game, its the true spiritual successor to Sim City."
15626,"If you love the sim city games then you will adore City Skylines! In my personal opinion it is way better than those games could ever dream of being and I loved those games so much as a kid! I find myself playing CIty Skylines for hours at a time without realizing as I perfect my city to be exactly how I want it to be. It can be pricey to get all the different bits of DLC, but at least for me it's been well worth the cost. I just know I'm going to be playing this game so much and even when I want to change things up there are challenges that can be done and plenty of different maps and content made by other players on the workshop.

It's definitely worth giving a shot for sure!"
15627,E
15628,dobar
15629,good
15630,you can cut off the connection to the outside world and slowly murder your people
15631,yeah man
15632,"Overpriced, DLC management turd."
15633,what the hell is a HHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHGGGGGGGGGGGAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
15634,great time filler
15635,Very fun and realaxing game.
15636,"Cities: Skylines still stands as one of the best city sim building games on the market. Traffic simulation here are one of the best, and expanding the functionality with the workshop has given the game great depth and longevity. You can spend hours building one city; and be warned - the game is nuanced with a lot of technical workings which are not apparent through the tutorials. You'll hit a wall with traffic fairly early on, but this puzzle logic to manage and smooth out road access in and out of your city is half the fun."
15637,"Rookie here, but seems quite cool"
15638,i exterminated the population of my city by accident
15639,i love this game no cap!! i cant believe i used to play sim city
15640,Awesome
15641,This game is amazing if you like building like me
15642,Excellent city builder game!
15643,its fun as FK
15644,This game make me play 15/24 hour per day
15645,"brilliant!
"
15646,"Cities Skylines, if played as shipped, is an excellent city building sim that lets you expand and grow a tiny town to a busy city. The games systems are designed around these constraints, and makes for a fun challenge as you grow and expand into different zones and sectors, and eventually think of how best to use your map resources. The developers also include ""cheats"" in the form of mods by default, so you can enjoy learning the systems naturally, or start a new game with everything at your finger tips. A fun challenge is to build a smallish city of 10,000+ citizens using cheats, and then reload the save with the cheats off to try and save it from collapse.

The game takes on an *entirely* new dimension with the workshop mods however, and can be thought of as the greatest city building framework out right now. With the addition of dozens of precision tools and editors, you can get increasingly granular in how you manage your traffic, roads, and industries, and it elevates the game from just excellent into a class it shares with other titles like Skyrim where the modding really makes the game more than the sum of its parts.

I could not recommend this game more to those who enjoy City Building sims, and if you ever enjoyed titles such as Sim City in the past, the rightful successor to the name doesn't like with the terrible reboot attempted years ago, but right here."
15647,haha road goes brr
15648,"What I liked is that you can download mods and always have fun building cities

What i dislike is that there is nothing to hate about it"
15649,"Tbh.. Great city building simulator but too many DLC packs and not enough ""gameplay"". It's more just city building simulator really. The whole economy part becomes completely obsolete after 1 hour of gameplay, you'll be so rich you can just do anything you want.

It's pretty fun but it just feels a bit pointless after a while. It's probably a lot more fun with all the DLCs but, I ain't buying all of those :)"
15650,NEEDS MORE UPDATING
15651,"this game is fun enough to keep buying dlcs from impulsive purchases

15/10 would go broke again"
15652,This game at first glance looks ok. with mods and assets it becomes more than ok . good game it is
15653,Mister Moose plays this game
15654,Very buggy with mods but other than that an amazing game.
15655,"While the game has some good mechanics, and it fills a good simcity role, the game has some serious shortfalls, namely the water and road mechanics are absolute trash, I initially enjoyed figuring out the road systems and figuring out ways to solve the crippling traffic problems, and while I did succeed, its pretty apparent that the traffic systems are simply broke. the traffic will simply never use all 3 lanes, they will always leave a lane empty for no reason, even if that lane is the lane they need to be in later down the road.

I uninstalled after some serious frustration with the water mechanics, the water simply doesn't follow physics,  if you make a slight change to a river, it will cause catastrophic problems somewhere else, even if you go out of your way to make sure the river flow is unaffected, e.g. making the river deeper or wider, the river will still overflow your city, and there is usually no coming back from it. I have consistently seen water flowing UPHILL, over and into massive areas of land that are many times over what the river fills, all because I simply raised a bit of extra land for my city, the game just breaks because it doesn't want you using that specific bit of land which vastly takes the fun away from trying to make unique and challenging cities.

Also the DLC is a joke, the game is missing a lot of things that the DLC provides, including important and much needed roads and missions or scenarios, city games are begging for scenario missions as a challenge and you have to pay £100+ if you want access to cities skylines full game.

if it wasnt for the water, I would genuinely still be playing now, I love building challenging cities in uninhabitable situations. but losing a city after 25 hours of building simply because the water mechanics are broke was just too much."
15656,its good
15657,I liked everything
15658,i enjoy watching things expand with all the different options in the game to make my city special. I was told by a coworker about Cities Skyline and decided to try it for the 1st time and been hooked for 124 hours so far
15659,This is the best city builder game out there. No other city builder games can even compare. This game was released back in 2015 and it feels like it came from the future while other 2021 city builder games feels like it came from the 90s. It has an active modding community and have TONS of asset in the workshop which u can sub and play with for free. Feeling creative? wanna build a city and drop a meteor? Tsunami? it all can be done.
15660,I must compare with SimCity2013 and previous versions. This game so far has met expectations and then some. Its slow to start but in game play is pretty awesome.
15661,nice and relaxed gameplay. fun to build a city and watch it grow
15662,Not much else to say. It's the city-building game
15663,"10/10 game, excited to see a possible cities skylines: 2; including a lot of features that mods provide."
15664,this game loads too dam slow and crashes.
15665,"As an architecture student, my time is very limited and I'm always burdened with revisions and such. Going back to my home I instantly play this game and now I'm exacerbating my due assignments. Thank you Paradox :D"
15666,Yeh
15667,Do I have to leave a comment to like it?
15668,"If you are going to play the vanilla game it is fun. If you want to really personalize the game with multiple mods, maps and go well beyond the basics the game is memory and RAM hungry and even powerful systems struggle to handle anything above very small populations, especially if you play on a MAC. Fix the latency issues and allow more customization and this is a fantastic game but be prepared for frustration if  you start to go deeply into mods."
15669,Nearly endless variety because of all the mods and custom assets available. Just check some YouTube videos to see how many different ways you can play this game! I keep coming back again and again.
15670,nice
15671,yes
15672,Been playing the game for years and still learning stuff. Well done and thanks for keeping me surprised by the depth of the game.
15673,Very fun to play. Lots of detail. a bit choppy on slower computers.
15674,$257 Canadian dollars to enjoy  $32.99 dollar base game. Go fuck yourself Paradox.
15675,great time killer
15676,Bird
15677,Very good
15678,"Recommended for anybody whom likes City Management or Tycoon games. But even people like myself, whom don't tend to like those style of games, will enjoy it. With Infinite Resources mode, you can just enjoy designing a city, and ignore the Management chaos.

A fun game to drop-in and drop-out for quick sessions of city-building."
15679,Its a good game
15680,"it is city but me make city bigger oh nno 5 am
"
15681,good gam
15682,Great game to play if you're into building cities
15683,"the best city building game for realism.  incredibly relaxing, impossible to lose.  biggest problem is balance.  money matters for about 5 minutes, then its irrelevant..."
15684,"I cant play the game normally, the workshop maps always have a game breaking problem that renders it unplayable.
The traffic is just horrible, noone knows how to drive in this game. 
Its clearly not in my computer beacuse it ran just fine a couple months ago.
Dont buy unless a sale."
15685,"this is a great game, the only downside is the ammount of DLC it has and the fact that they come with the game but to play with them you need to unlock them by buying them

you can play this game for hours, i recomend all the dlc that are major content additions 
"
15686,One of best games ever! Great depth
15687,very enjoy to play!
15688,"Fun Sim game. Though i do agree that paying $200+ for everything can be expensive i'd recommend buying just the base game, then once you start hitting that ""I've done all i can"" feeling, that's when you go pick out any of the non radio DLC. Unlike some games where the game is released with DLC to finish it at an additional charge,  this one was a finished game and instead of just releasing a new version they went ahead and added in what would realistically be a full 2nd games worth of stuff that you can pick up in any order to enjoy."
15689,sdada
15690,good
15691,"My wife mockingly calls me ""The Mayor."" Good game."
15692,"If you think you've just discovered the base game, there are lots of awesome DLC's to discover and there are just so many items on the workshop that you can really create whatever you want. The best city builder ever!"
15693,"If you enjoy creating cities this is the game for you. Great mod support. Wonderful game to relax. Highly recommended. Traffic management can be a headache at first, specially without mods."
15694,Excellent game.
15695,i will spend so many hours on this game . I hate it
15696,crashing!!! last update fuckup something
15697,"After SimCity gave up on this space many years ago, City Skylines filled the gap. It lacks the same soul SimCity had, but it has a lot more features and is constantly coming out with new stuff."
15698,dis gud gam
15699,"É o tipo de jogo que você passa horas sem nem perceber. O jogo já é muito bom e se quiser mais realismo ou controle sobre certos aspectos do jogo ou até mesmo colocar um caminhão de entrega de alguma empresa famosa, você pode adicionar mod e assets e tornar o jogo ainda mais completo. Mas cuidado, alguns deles pode fazer seu jogo crashar e/ou deixar muito pesado. Meu notebook é fraquinho e eu consigo abrir o jogo, mas leva algum tempo(uns 40 min.) e depois q abre e carrega tudo, ele roda suave. 
Se você gosta de construir cidades então tem que jogar esse jogo!"
15700,Minecraft creative mode
15701,great way to spend £100 just try to equal your hours with the amount you spent
15702,"+takes time

-takes time


"
15703,"In the past I really enjoyed playing SimCity 2000 & 3000, SimCity 4, Cities XL etc.
After the 2013 SimCity disaster I just kept playing older city builders because there was nothing else good out there. That is, until Cities: Skylines came out. I was already a fan of Colossal Order because of their Cities in Motion games and when Cities Skylines finally came out it really felt like what SimCity (2013) tried to be but never achieved. 

There are flaws in the game, some things don't work logical or in the way you expect but in general Cities: Skylines is in my opinion the best modern city builder, even though it has been released over 5 years ago. You can build immensely huge cities compared to other city builders, create many types of different transportation routes, let your imagination do the work and create new cities, expand older ones or anything in between. 

The only complaint I have is that they have too many DLCs that add too little to the game. Some of the DLCs are just content taken from the Steam Workshop and ""approved by the developer"" when they can essentially be downloaded for free. 
The ""bigger"" DLCs add a few neat features but don't justify the +/- 13-15 USD/EUR they cost for each of them. If you would want to get the full game today with all DLCs you'd spend over 200 USD/EUR and that's just way too much. 

To summarise: Great game but too many expensive DLCs.

Also, pro tip, use this guide to skip the bulky, unnecessary Paradox launcher bloatware: https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1976349559"
15704,Great Game
15705,"This game managed to be everything I had hoped it would be and then some, with all the wonderful attention to little details and customization options. Fans of the genre wont want to miss this one."
15706,The benchmark for city sims.
15707,A great distraction from life.
15708,Never have I had such a primal uproar from looking at a fake road
15709,Nice game a lot of fun and the time goes fast when playing. :)
15710,Nice and detailed simulation but can get very complex on you specially the traffic.
15711,good
15712,It's good.
15713,v fun
15714,Ridiculously addictive and so much fun!
15715,"best ever city builder, shoot for the stars !!!"
15716,Worth Playing!
15717,Good game to sit and chill out with music. Sometimes challenging.
15718,It crashes and no autosave
15719,"Excellent game, but hard to get to load correctly on windows 10."
15720,I liek it

15738,"if simcity dissapoints you now a days then this is very much the way to go. you dont require the DLC to proceed with the game and you can make most of the decisions you need to in order to make a decent city. or town. or village, whatever takes your fancy,"
15739,A really good game for those that are into city building!
15740,"good
"
15741,"With enough mods, this is the clear winner hands down in the city building genre. I see few others being able to better it. The true 'spiritual' successor to Sim City 4 (SC5 is fine for pre-teens not serious enthusiasts)."
15742,"Addicted. Every time I stop playing I know exactly what I’m gonna do next, and it’s usually a big pathlaying project: bus lines one night, metro rail the next, and then big train stations between your more rural areas the night after that. Just base game so far, but I can tell the public transit is what’s most hoipe for me in this game. Gonna try out some DLC."
15743,
15744,Played the original SimCity the day it came out. Cities Skylines is what a new SimCity should have been.
15745,I do not respect the game's mechanics of garbage management.
15746,"good game, if you have natural disasters on, maybe turn it off on your first city. 4 hours of work ruined by a devastating earthquake. still had fun tho"
15747,"ok now that i have almost 100 hours on this game i feel i can give my opinion. 

pretty good game, but for me extremely laggy once your city gets more than 50k people

i give 8/10"
15748,fun
15749,Fun bulding!
15750,A lovely way to pass the time and build a mini empire for your imaginary minions to live their lives before you return to the droll drudgery of your own pointless reality.
15751,banger game besties but unfortunately it brokey so my mods dont work so the game is shit now
15752,"When I first purchased this game, I originally couldn't play it. So, the big majority of my hours have been over the past week after obtaining a good laptop. This game is amazing. No doubt about it. I brought the deluxe edition (can't remember if I got it on sale or not but hey) and everything in the vanilla game is great. I've messed with a few mods like Find it, Move it etc (highly recommendable from the workshop) and once you get into the game and explore it the game really does become a ""build the city of your dreams"" type of deal. I'm currently working on making my own home town thanks to the amount of mods that are easily accessible and you can most likely make your own home town too in this game! Now not to say that the Vanilla game isn't worth it, because it of course is! If you don't want to go on the workshop then the game is worth its price. I'm just letting you all know about how great the community tools are alongside the great game!

Over all £12 for a nearly limitless city builder = iconic, legendary and the moment."
15753,"It's pretty good, everything SimCity 2013 should have been and more. Solid DLCs and so much mod support to cover everything that isn't available in the game."
15754,Detailed Citybuilder that is widely enjoyable
15755,love it ! easy to play and hours of fun .. lots to discover and build
15756,Build city
15757,Over 300 hours in this game and it just stopped working. Neither Steam nor Paradox will help me resolve this issue. I followed all the trouble shooting actions in the FAQs with no results. I am quite disappointed in both Steam and Paradox. I have not purchased another game through Steam since and will not in the future.
15758,ô
15759,"Cities: Skylines is fun, accessible and even somewhat realistic, but it fails in the endgame as there are less obvious objectives and the sandbox can only offer so much. Still, the early- and mid-game sections, combined with the adaptable nature of the game, make it worth 20€ for me."
15760,Hours of fun building up a city and running it.
15761,Nice game
15762,"WOW, $12 for a deluxe game and you still have to buy every important feature separately. What is DLC and all these sh*t? freaking provide all features in just one game. If a person wants any game the provide him the whole game"
15763,its a game and its cool
15764,The best PC game

15766,"Good game great simulation in the City Builder. It is a challenge that you are the mayor of the city of you've created, Constructing your city from the ground up is easy to learn, but hard to master it. The gameplay elements to realize the thrill and hardships of creating and maintaining a city."
15767,hui9iuh99vy7bv
15768,it is a super good game
15769,"As a guy who smokes weed every day I must say that as a kid I was always fascinated with maps and how cities are made. I would've spent a dozen hours in books reading about historic cities, and then with the YouTube era I would've spent even more time watching videos on how modern metropolitan areas are made.
This title lets me transfer all my dream cities that I’ve created, either in my mind or on a piece of paper when I was a kid, into actual “living” cities. I personally believe, this is the best sandbox in the history of gaming.
The workshop is high quality, just excellent. This game is still playable for hundreds of hours because of the community. People support this game non-stop, uploading sick content every day.
I rate this masterpiece 10/10.
Danielo."
15770,"One of my most favourite games on steam. 
Unfortunately the game cannot handle much assets from the workshop!
It took me 10 minute just for the game to load to the menu because the game would be unresponsive. THEN! I would create a new game, the loading for a save is probably the most tedious and slow thing I've ever experienced. For a game that I spent 60 Dollars on I expect to run properly. I don't have that much mods, but the game can barely run 5 of them AT ONCE!
It's extremely disappointing considering I have a beast of a computer. It seems I can't have much assets either, or else the loading time will take 6 hours and will most likely crash within 5 minutes :/
I may have 129 hours on this game, but that was when it ran like a normal game. All this began around the middle of 2020. Then I just gave up, logged back on in July 2021, still the same, and now I'm back. Guess what? STILL THE SAME!!!
I cannot even fathom or describe how angry I am when it doesn't work. I know it's not my computer, so get that out your head. I have enough RAM, I have 1200 gigs of storage. What's the problem Paradox? Because it's hella annoying having to put up with this. I even purchased a couple DLC's for A LOT of money in 2019. I literally saved for ages.
Oh and by the way. No I cannot refund the game, games cannot be refunded if you've played a certain amount of it.
All I can say is, I don't recommend this game, but I also do.
Only buy this if you have the best PC in the world, make sure you got a $50,000 gaming PC with 32 gigs of RAM and runs fuckin 16K graphics with the best CPU.

Have fun :)"
15771,"Really wanted to check this game out ever since I saw GrayStillPlays & RTGame play it at some point before.

Aside from managing the financials (which in my case is a pain in the bum) , it's a really chill game in the end, and I can spend hours on it just to continue on my town. Plus points for the modding community in the Steam Workshop, they're a godsend and make the playing the game much more enjoyable.

20/10, definitely would recommend to those who want to try this out for themselves. :)"
15772,"Made a 70k pop city with just using one and two lane roads and no public transportation whatsoever. I hit the last milestone, biggest city. 
All of the public transportation options in the game are far too underwhelming. You never have enough people in the ""city"" to  need the any of it, the different forms just cost a lot and are fun to toy around with. So if you want to dink around- great. Not really a challenging game tho except for how well you use one and two lane roads."
15773,I can have fun for hours with this game. I love the scope.
15774,Launcher crash issue with Citrix is back after latest update to the launcher.
15775,Very good game
15776,"Endless game, maybe with way much DLCs but endless game regardless of that."
15777,Great game. Takes a little time to adjust and get stuff down but amazing after
15778,nuj  mnerge
15779,My playtime speaks for itself.
15780,"Fantastic game
"
15781,Very addicting!
15782,"I got the game when it was 70-50% off. I would not buy the game full price. You'd be looking at over $200 to buy the game and all the DLC. That said, if you enjoied the SimCity before EA did it's thing, it could be a fun game."
15783,"I love the game but the only real way to make some badass cities is to pickup a couple mods, DLCS, and you can get lost in it!"
15784,fun

15792,"В целом, конечно, высококачественный прототип будущего проекта позволяет выполнить важные задания по разработке распределения внутренних резервов и ресурсов. В своём стремлении улучшить пользовательский опыт мы упускаем, что элементы политического процесса лишь добавляют фракционных разногласий и в равной степени предоставлены сами себе. Разнообразный и богатый опыт говорит нам, что дальнейшее развитие различных форм деятельности не оставляет шанса для дальнейших направлений развития.

Вот вам яркий пример современных тенденций - укрепление и развитие внутренней структуры требует определения и уточнения существующих финансовых и административных условий. Современные технологии достигли такого уровня, что постоянное информационно-пропагандистское обеспечение нашей деятельности говорит о возможностях форм воздействия. Ясность нашей позиции очевидна: высокое качество позиционных исследований напрямую зависит от экономической целесообразности принимаемых решений. Есть над чем задуматься: диаграммы связей неоднозначны и будут объявлены нарушающими общечеловеческие нормы этики и морали.

Таким образом, повышение уровня гражданского сознания создаёт предпосылки для модели развития. Имеется спорная точка зрения, гласящая примерно следующее: ключевые особенности структуры проекта формируют глобальную экономическую сеть и при этом - описаны максимально подробно. Сложно сказать, почему тщательные исследования конкурентов будут своевременно верифицированы! В своём стремлении улучшить пользовательский опыт мы упускаем, что многие известные личности заблокированы в рамках своих собственных рациональных ограничений. Но укрепление и развитие внутренней структуры предполагает независимые способы реализации благоприятных перспектив. В своём стремлении повысить качество жизни, они забывают, что повышение уровня гражданского сознания создаёт предпосылки для позиций, занимаемых участниками в отношении поставленных задач.

Значимость этих проблем настолько очевидна, что начало повседневной работы по формированию позиции требует определения и уточнения поэтапного и последовательного развития общества. Банальные, но неопровержимые выводы, а также сделанные на базе интернет-аналитики выводы представляют собой не что иное, как квинтэссенцию победы маркетинга над разумом и должны быть призваны к ответу.

Имеется спорная точка зрения, гласящая примерно следующее: действия представителей оппозиции могут быть объявлены нарушающими общечеловеческие нормы этики и морали. С учётом сложившейся международной обстановки, консультация с широким активом создаёт предпосылки для распределения внутренних резервов и ресурсов. Безусловно, постоянное информационно-пропагандистское обеспечение нашей деятельности однозначно определяет каждого участника как способного принимать собственные решения касаемо переосмысления внешнеэкономических политик. Современные технологии достигли такого уровня, что реализация намеченных плановых заданий способствует повышению качества системы массового участия.

Разнообразный и богатый опыт говорит нам, что базовый вектор развития представляет собой интересный эксперимент проверки модели развития. Повседневная практика показывает, что высокотехнологичная концепция общественного уклада способствует повышению качества существующих финансовых и административных условий. В своём стремлении улучшить пользовательский опыт мы упускаем, что сделанные на базе интернет-аналитики выводы призывают нас к новым свершениям, которые, в свою очередь, должны быть объявлены нарушающими общечеловеческие нормы этики и морали.

15793,"I really am enjoying this game, even more than expected. My husband got it for me for Christmas because I used to play SimCity, but always quit after a while because it was bug-y and the AI was really frustrating. Cities:Skylines is Much better! More variety of tasks, more interesting policies and services, and the AI of the citizenry makes a lot more sense - they don't drive like raving lunatics for one thing and they make intelligent use of mass transit (so they don't keep abandoning housing because of commute time). 
Choosing various DLC expansions allows for further customization of the game and is not excessively expensive. I highly recommend the Mass Transit DLC but my all-time favorite is ParkLife.
You can make custom ""assets"" (buildings, parks, etc) very easily with the in-game editor, and be sure to take advantage of the many (free) assets from the Steam Workshop. 
(There are loads of free and useful ""mods"" to simplify and enhance gameplay, as well, but I haven't used any and I'm doing just fine)
PLEASE NOTE: I do Not have 1000+ hours played - the game got left running in the background a couple times and clocks hours even if you're on the loading screen!"

I would compare it to playing Minecraft. It's a great city builder that has a ton of extra detail which you can get into or you can play this completely casual and not have to worry about not being able to play."

15807,"I have the entire game (All DLC except the Bridges and Piers and the Train Station updates.) IT'S SO FUN. I can dump hours into just watching my city grow, figuring out traffic management and trying to make money.

15818,ok
15819,"Wonderful, relaxing, OCD-Friendly game"
15820,"Im going to leave a positive review, because when the game works, its great.

But I really have to stress that this game is prone to crashing A LOT. It feels like there is a 50/50 chance that I can get past the main menu without it just closing altogether. And then there are other times when the game will just randomly crash while you're in the middle of playing. Sometimes it will give you an error notification before it closes, other times it just closes instantly. And of course, the game doesn't have any type of auto-save feature or anything. so all unsaved progress is just gone. And I've tried it with and without mods. it still crashes a bunch.

I also would like to say that the loading screens are incredibly long. which doesn't pair well with the constant crashes.

All of that aside, if you can get past those 2 issues, or if you're lucky in that it doesn't crash often. The game is really great, and a lot of fun"
15821,"Its been a while since I've last played the game. I've always enjoyed playing the game and always recommended it to people. So I decided to reinstall the game and play it again (its been about a couple years since I last played). It's constantly crashing and freezing (even with no mods/assets enabled), and for some reason can't get the modifier button to work like it use to (use to be able to use the mouse to grab the map and twist and turn it. Can't do that anymore and cant change it in the options). Definitely not worth the high price tag for the base game and dlc."
15822,"Love this game, reminds me of Simcity back in the day. Going to start slowly adding on to the expansions. Really excited for the natural disasters one."

15854,"This is pretty much THE city builder to play. It looked at the SimCity series and the Cities XL series, and raised the bar by miles. Additionally, mod support means you can add tons of functionality and eye candy if you wish to do so. Currently 200 hours in, which isn't much to be honest, but that has nothing to do with the quality of the game: I just have too many games to play and too little time. :))"

15886,Good game
15887,"The best city builder game I know.

City builder for casual players:
- Vanilla gameplay is quite fun, the economy is balanced
- You will gradually open new content by growing your city
- Game is good to just ""sit and watch"" as every simulation game should be

City builder for advanced players and architectors:
- Mod support allows you to convert this game into true city planning software
- With mods, you can detail your city at any level you want, down to individual flowers in your city park
- Mods enhancing visuals provide nearly photorealistic graphics

Cons:
- Game is quite performance heavy: you will need a good graphics card and a lot of RAM, especially when loading custom assets from the Steam Workshop
- Vanilla game has some annoyances, that can be fixed with ""quality of life"" mods
- Price policy is not for everyone. It is DLC-based, so you'll have to pay for the new content. Some mods depend on DLCs, so you cannot bypass it"

15898,"I've wasted a significant amount of my life building cities, i regret nothing.

I haven't bought any expansion packs as they all look overpriced and underwhelming."
15899,i deprived my cities of water
15900,amazing
15901,"fuck my resignation.
"
15902,I love building massive cities and then starving them to death!
15903,Fun
15904,"This is a very fun game, in which you can build your own city at will, well worth buying"
15905,its just so muct fun
15906,"this game/reality for sims is absolutely worth your time.  If you were a fan of Sim City or Theo City, you will instantly fall in love with this title...From the Engine to the details of the environment, it has it all...There are a few different way (modes) to play...if u decide on the sorta sandbox mode (free play) becareful you don't get lost in the subscription/asset bank threw steam...second to none   10/10"
15907,"This is by far the best city builder game on the market right now.  It can be very taxing if you don't have a good rig, so make sure you PC is above and beyond the recommended specs."
15908,"ngecrash mulu ajg mau bikin kota tiba""fc asw emg paradog"
15909,Absolutely the best city builder/management game out there! I keep going back for more! I wish DLCs wasnt the only way they expand the game though. Im not rich enough to get all the DLC.
15910,"Super chill, lots of fun. If you love Paradox games, or even just 1 title, this game will satisfy you. Plus Steam Workshop ;)"
15911,"Oke, this game is really nice and fun for alot of  hours and frustrating with traffic/road in general if you want to create or manage a city in single player its a nice game for the price.

But, the big but is; The game is old 2015 and adding up dlc makes it not worth for me anymore.

I hoped to have a multiplayer modus / cities: skyline 2... So i could compete with my friends cities or something?

But for a 6 year old game with so much dlc.... I get the feeling is getting to be  a milkcow for ever."
15912,"Fun game. More fun than SimCity 4. Yes, there are a lot of DLCs, but at this early point in the game, I haven't needed them to have fun. And there are also mods, which are FREE."
15913,I personally love this game. It allows me to destress and just have fun building a fictional city
15914,:)
15915,"This was my first city building game. I did the maths on this: It has been 51 hours since I installed this game. Of those 51 hours, I spent 21 of them sleeping, 4.2 of them doing other activities and 25.8 of them playing Cities: Skylines. My neck is ruined, my back hurts and my city is flooded again after my seventh attempt at creating a dam."
15916,It's just great
15917,worth it
15918,good
15919,"A game that is both challenging and fun. With the additional add-on games it really allows you to create a lifelike society to be proud of. I had to utilised many online tutorials for the finer details of game play, but once that was done, I was happy with my progress."
15920,nice
15921,Every time i play this game i get a fizzy feeling
15922,SUSY DABABA AMOGUS GAME REAL GOOD GAME
15923,so much fun :)
15924,great city builder. i always lose track of time
15925,"if youre into city building, this is it"
15926,good game
15927,im suffering
15928,k
15929,"Great Game And Great Mods 
"
15930,I love this game
15931,they say this is a city builder but in reality its a highway and road optimization simulator.
15932,Love it!
15933,I like simulation games in general and this game is very playable.
15934,"Certified hood classic. The best city builder/management game you could find on Steam rn. Micromanagement, which I am not fond of, is luckily quite limited in the game. Very addicting gameplay loop which will make you never want to stop. DLC is needed for full experience but the base game is still worth the price."
15935,"If you like sim city, you will love this."
15936,FUN
15937,If you're into building games this would be a great game for you. An over all good game to dump some hours in. Also there's a whole bunch of mods that you can download. My personal would be mods that bring irl buildings to the game.
15938,i really enjoy this game for its playstyle and it is overall a good game 7/10
15939,Best City Builder game on the block by far...especially thanks to the talented workshop modders. 10/10
15940,"A surprisingly deep and engrossing city builder with focus on foresight, planning and the ability to advance your design. No two cities will look the same in this game, which of course goes without saying. What does not go without saying is frustration and time sink this game will cause in the start of a playthrough, though for avid strategy fans this is to be expected. 

Though I am not entirely comfortable giving scores to strategy games, for the sake of argument the game is an 8/10, though this is up for change with the inclusion of DLC and modding as I have not indulged in this aspect of the game."
15941,"Very relaxing. The ultimate, zero pressure game."
15942,Decent
15943,fine
15944,It is one of the most realistic city planning games (mods required). Behaves very realistically.
15945,plantation simulator safe
15946,"is good... cities skylines roolz, simcity droolz."
15947,its goood
15948,nice
15949,"Great city building game. I'm glad to see it took off where simcity cut short. I loved Simcity, but like everyone else, it just hits a wall. So far, really enjoying this."
15950,"A really good city game! I have 1 suggestion and 1 bug.  There is a bug where cars and people start floating around the map. The suggestion is that you add radiation. Like if a nuclear power plant gets destroyed, not demolished but destroyed, like by a meteor or a tsunami radiation will start to spread around the area. And citizens will get sick if in that area."
15951,Hyvä ompi
15952,"If you like SimCity, this is a better version of it. Better UI, better information provided, and more control over your city. Some of the DLC are really fun."
15953,Best city builder game out there!
15954,I was not so sure about the game so I only bought the vaniila version but then I like it more and more so I ended up buying 4 more other DLCs. I enjoy the game and have played 50 hours so far ^^
15955,10 out of 10 good game but could use some more content... maybe some
15956,"This game is AMAZING!!! I just started digging in and checking things out, but, so far I'm very impressed. This is what I had hoped for from Simcity (2013)"
15957,"Let me put it like this.
I looked at all the DLC and said 'as if I'll download any of that, the base game is fine on it's own'
Something like a 80 mods, thousand assets and most of the DLC's later... yeah, it's a good game."
15958,Would I recommend it: Yes..... kinda one of my favourite games of all times!!!!
15959,"I have spent 6 hours on fixing slow traffic...
totally worth it"
15960, .
15961,"It might be six years old, but Skylines is still the best city builder out there.   The passionate mod and asset creation communities keep things interesting, and the core game remains solid.  I'm way too obsessed with this game."
15962,"I just played this game for 3 hours, it's a little complicated for me because the tutorial is not really helpful.
But I love the creativity they allow us to do in this game, it's wonderful, it's gorgeous and I start to love it.
One thing I dislike about it: It makes me addicted! Lovely. Thanks devs for creating this wonderful game."
15963,Intricate and absorbing game that can be fun for beginners or the old head alike.  Have totally enjoyed and continue to enjoy this outstanding game.
15964,"I LOVE this game! Have continued to play it, some of the mods slow it down so be careful if you go for that. Traffic Manager is an awesome one to utilize tho. Overall, I think its a great city builder and better than my interest Sims City 4, the most modern one. There are a lot of DLC's but they come with new maps and thats why I love them, because of the different env'ts to build in.
Be well!"
15965,
15966,Addictive and rewarding.
15967,Great time playing other then few bugs i ran into where my dams stop working even tho they were working a second ago
15968,"First city simulator since SNES SimCity. There are a few rough spots, such as ""space already occupied"" problems when trying to connect or move roads, but overall the game is incredible in its depth and flexibility. This is a soothing, immersive, and rewarding therapy activity when partaking of one's preferred medical herb."
15969,as great as my mother's spaget
15970,cool
15971,More like a traffic simulator but it is challenging.
15972,"I absolutely love this type/style of game.  I know it shows only 18 hours played but I've been playing Vanilla on my xbox since the games inception.  This is my top of the list as far as City-Builders.  I have waited very patiently for my PC set-up, as it brings a whole new Dynamic with all these Mods."
15973,Is good
15974,"Amazing game! Only bad part about this game is that it is insanely addictive, and it will keep you playing for too long!"
15975,"Cities Skylines must be one of my favourite games. The base game offers hours and hours of possible playtime, and the workshop allows you to add anything you want. They also keep releasing new content, every time they release a DLC they add new free features to the basegame. And speaking of the DLCs, they're great too! The DLCs aren't just new maps (although every DLC adds some) but they all add some new unique content and gameplay."
15976,oil go brrrrr
15977,"honestly, im not one for city building games but this is a pretty good game for people who enjoy efficiency"
15978,A clever and brilliant game. A little bit of a steep learning curve and I recommend watching people play on YouTube and getting some key mods. I play it far FAR more than any other game though.
15979,i made poop venice
15980,awesome !!
15981,need war
15982,Fantastic Game for the person who enjoys managing an economy and playing a game that is no where near limited.
15983,Dont download to many mods and your performance will be fine.
15984,"This is an awesome game if you love to have fun. It plays great, awesome mechanics and with all the effort put into this game, the possibilities for your city are endless. If you play this game you will be sure to at least enjoy yourself a little bit"
15985,please help i have a severe addiction to cities skylines. For the past day all i have played is cities skylines. I will not sleep drink or eat until my city covers an entire country. I cant stop playing cities skylines. I hate barrack obama for reasons i do not understand. please. I cant stop playing cities skylines. I cant stop playing cities skylines. I cant stop playing cities skylines. I cant stop playing cities skylines. I cant stop playing cities skylines. I cant stop playing cities skylines. I cant stop playing cities skylines. I cant stop playing cities skylines. I cant stop playing cities skylines. I cant stop playing cities skylines. I cant stop playing cities skylines.
15986,"I mean, the game is alright or whatever"
15987,"some mod do not ""like move it"""
15988,"So much time sunk in this (the record does not show the real time, no idea why) it is so nice to just relax and chill."
15989,"I really enjoyed this game, I would have given up if not for the incredible videos that everyone put up on you tube though.. thanks peeps , you made this game great for me."
15990,Pretty cool so far
15991,very fun when bored
15992,"This is by far the best city building game I've ever played. Back in the day I was a big Sim City fan and I didn't really think anything would pull me away from the Sim City games. Granted, when I started playing this game it had been years since I last built a city in Sim City. But I initially started playing this game on my PS4 when it was offered up as a free game for PlayStation Plus. After building my first city on my PS4 I opted to switch over and buy the game on PC (the fact that I had the game for free on my PS4 and I was still willing to pay for the game on PC really does speak to the quality and fun of the game). 

But this game completely enthralled me. I don't know what it is but it is really relaxing to lose oneself in the construction of a city. It's a very nice way to just decompress and have some mindless fun. Plus it's a Paradox game so of course it's going to be good. 

Overall 9/10"
15993,If you like city building you will love this. I am an original SimCity player who spent many hours building. This is the dream evolution of that great game.
15994,"im not good at it, but i enjoy it. makes me appreciate the people who do similar work in real life."
15995,Love this game
15996,"like sim city on steroids, the game is easy enough to get familiar with if you haven't watched tutorials. lots of fun, and easy to get lost into the gameplay quickly realising it's 2am and you've got work in the morning.
i've played about 24 hours so far (over 3 days!), and i love it. got it on sale, so if you can wait that long, it's worth it.
one thing i wish they would add in the game: a four lane one way road!!! they have 2 lane and 6 lane, why not 4????"
15997,"good
"
15998,"No matter what I do - everything goes down the drain sooner rather than later. Traffic congestion, water/industry pollution, population's mass deaths, even the basic grid cells - everything is acting against the player. Can't even place a pre-made roundabout into the empty spot, And plugins do not help."
15999,"yeah, it's a good game.
better then the simscity games for sure, it's kinda like that but more content for sure"
16000,LOVELY GAME
16001,A fantastic way to lose hours
16002,is supper funnnnnnn
16003,great game
16004,Fun time killer/city building game
16005,Nice.
16006,i ran e siti
16007,"As I'm sure you can tell from hours on record, I get lost in this game. I love the mechanics, and seamless integration with the workshop. I have purchased multiple DLC's over the two years I've owned this game (Some of which are worth the money, others did not feel like it such as the snow DLC) and I've enjoyed creating little towns, metropolitan areas, as well as giant ""Factories"" that import/export large quantities of items. Your imagination is the limit with this game backed by community items and features.

If you plan on modding it, I highly suggest reading a guide. Some mods such as custom props require pre-requisite mods, and that isn't mentioned anywhere, creating unnecessary confusion. Make sure you have all pre-requisites before launching your new city idea."
16008,cool
16009,Half of the my playing time was for arranging mods :)
16010,"Gaming on both Windows and Linux environment.

Windows version run on Windows, of course game run out of the box! But expect slower performance when your city become big!

Linux native version, able to run, able to see main menu, able to start a new fresh new game. But if you load saved games or when your game become big, you need more SWAP! (You can use either swap partition or swap file, I prefer using swap partition) I recommend 32 GB of swap. Another hit and miss, if you use TM:PE mod, you need to use the TEST version, not the STABLE (so far the TEST version is stable enough, it just have more recent features). Looks and perform similar like the Windows version run on Windows. I recommend to install mono-runtime package from your distribution just in case.

Windows version run on Linux via Proton (6.3). Run OK. Slight more performance, but the texture is just ... OK. Not terrible but not really good compared to the rest version. Also you need to workaround with (by disabling) the Paradox launcher. Also the game will become heavier soon. Not recommend running this game via Proton.

Oh, if you like city building game, this is the best game out there! Just grab it!

I am NOT using Arch btw. When playing this game on Linux, I'm using openSUSE 15.3 with Plasma 5.18. Your experience playing this game on Linux may varies."
16011,"ALLAH IS PLEASED WITH THE CITY I HAVE SACRIFICED, COME BROTHERS AND SISTERS, HELP PLEASE THE LORD!"
16012,why i buy
16013,"Can they not make an actually good tutorial explaining everything step by step? Because the game is pretty difficult to understand and learn when your new to city building games. Like for instance how on earth do I connect buildings to power. It certainly did not explain how to do that. Pretty dissapointed as it renders the game useless to me. But the actual game itself is probably amazing because the graphics are absolutely stunning for 2015 and the water runs smoothly the buildings are amazing, the trees have wind I also sadly don't have a good computer so I can't run it at its full quality but fix up the tutorial and its an amazing game."
16014,It's a good game.
16015,big city very scary
16016,"solid city builder
"
16017,i love turning dams into a sewage tsunami
16018,bet ever
16019,awesome game! blows other city building games out of the water!
16020,gud
16021,v fun
16022,i played this game for 7 hours straight yesterday
16023,I thoroughly enjoyed watching other people playing this game and I've come to really enjoy making my own cities with the knowledge I get from other players.
16024,You build cities in this game.
16025,"Answering yes or no to this question for this game is harder than most games.

Yes, I like that it takes me back to being a kid and playing Sim City because it came free on Windows. It scratches that itch.

But at the same time, I have fewer than 60 hours on a game that I should love, that I've owned for many years. I'm pretty sure the first week my family had that Compaq with Windows and FREE SimCity, I knocked out at least 60 hours on that game.

I'm open to the idea that maybe middled aged me likes something different than teenage me. But it's not like I've suddenly gotten a taste for fast action, high stakes games. I like slow games. I like sandboxes. So I can't put my finger on what has kept me from going all in. Closest guess I have is that there's quite a bit of obscured info in the game. Why does a business become abandoned, and then the second you bulldoze it, another business pops into its place and sticks around? Why does traffic continue to form a bottleneck when you've made a sensible alternate route?

But I'll keep doing what I've done for years: gorge on building a city for a couple days, get tired of it after the third day, and not play again for a couple years. That's about how good I think it is. It's as good as any other little gadget that can hold your attention for a short period of time over a long era of your life."
16026,:thumbs_up:
16027,Yes
16028,"This game picked up the mantle from Sim City and ran with it. Will Wright would be proud, if not a little jealous. One of the all time great city builders, cant wait to see what comes next from this developer."

16037,"This game is far better then any other city builder style game out to date. Community Mods as well making the small things better.
Very chill relaxing game. I'll come back to this one every so often.
Con, Mods are expensive. But do add a fair bit more enjoyment.
Devs did a good job with this one."

16046,"it looks  nice plays well reminds me of sim city on the amiga .

don't likes are the metro stations you can build but can't connect since you are unable to see where you are going beneath the surface , should have been made like the water pipes instead."

16053,An impressive game with endless city possibilities.
16054,build city fun
16055,A neat evolution of the SimCity-type formula.
16056,"Good game, gets repetitive after a few playthres tho, I recommend incrementally adding mods"
16057,I find myself on Google Earth looking for places I want to recreate almost as much as actually recreating them.
16058,making hell
16059,This is a fun game you can just relax and have a pleasant time on. However you could be a masochist and do everything the super hard way. all in all an amazing game. 10/10
16060,"Great Game, only thing i wish for is to be able to connect to other players-cities to trade/visit etc..."
16061,"The only limits is your creativity....... annnnnd... processing capabilities of your machine. 

I run in Windows mode on my 2019 27"" iMac i5 9900k with 64Gb Ram with Radeon 580Pro and start to chug along once i start having 40-50K population.  No mods...   
Still lots of fun nonetheless... I'll ask MR. Apple for a discount on a fully spec'd Mac pro next time i see him. LOL"

16063,"I bought this expecting a full fledged game, but ran out of content after about 6 hours. Apparently you have to buy a ton of DCL content to actually make the game enjoyable. I get why Devs release DLC content but this is ridiculous. If this is how Paradox Interactive does business I wont be buying any more of their games. Total trash"
16064,its aight
16065,yeah
16066,way too expensive but very fun
16067,its just the best city building game ever
16068,It's very fun although I would recommend you get a DLC or else the game could get a little bit boring.
16069,good game

16075,hi my name is kid kid fht aka jk aka juan karlquist and tody im going on online
16076,"Fun city builder game, that is nice to chill and play by yourself. Large selection of DLC that goes on sale often, so piecing together the whole set is fun overtime. Great community with plenty of mods and assets via the workshop that adds to the experience."
16077,"Best Game ever, girlfriend hates when I play this game because ""its too boring"" is one of her quotes another is ""its been 3 hours and it still a city don't you actually do anything in this game?"" Great game might lose relationship. 10/10"

16087,"Cities Skylines is the Best. If you love Sim Cities or Just Tycoon games in general, Cities Skylines if for you! Want to build a city on mars? Just install some mods and you're up and going. Want to create a Zoo or Amusement Park? Just buy Park Life. There is nothing you cannot do in the modern version of Sim City!
I recently voted this game for the Labor of Love award because they keep on updating it with new dlcs and free content.

16094,The game made me lose 23 hours of a scenario because it tried to divide by zero and gave me an error. Then it had the audacity to claim I had zero population after the error when it said I had 23k; and let me know when the Statue of Liberty is on land. It's like the only experience of the US came from eating at a McDonald's in Stockholm.

16129,good
16130,"I got the base version of this game free on Epic and played multiple weeks of it until i found out that steam version has cheaper DLCs(for me) and workshop full of mods and assets which are super easy to install(just subscribe and done) compared on Epic so when steam sale came i got this game immediately and have been playing since. Must play if you like simulation games, this game is pretty realistic except the traffic is dumb or is it ??"

16134,"yes

16135,"As a player who grew up with games like SimCity, Cities:Skylines takes city building simulation to the next level. With mods and DLC, there are essentially infinite levels of customization. Of course, this game has its shortcomings (such as the AI choosing the shortest route between two locations, rather than the fastest) but it's still worth it. I recommend that new players begin playing without any DLC or just the starter pack bundle, because the level of customization can get very overwhelming very fast. Take it slow at first, because this game really does require a level of skill to build your exact vision."

16162,"If you want a game that crashes 24/7 this is the game for you! I have a Lenovo Legion 5 2021 model brand new, and this game shouldn't be this buggy. Awesome game when it works that 5% of the time."
16163,"About 150 hours with the Xbox version, about 50 hours with the Playstation version, and now I'm back in the PC version... Yes, I love Cities Skylines. To be honest, this is the best city management game since the first Sim City. At the moment, there is no game that beats this title, and there will be no sooner. If it seems like a difficult game to someone at first, I recommend being patient. The basis of this game is planning in advance and realising what you really want to achieve in your city - in which direction to develop your population. I really recommend this title and a large part of the DLC which is available right now. The game relaxes and allows you to break away from the problems of everyday life. The satisfaction that flows with the moment we observe the development of our city is amazing."

Other than that, a super-fun and engaging game,, only requires a few restarts of a save to get the hang of most things."

16210,"I started playing this game on the Switch, and when I did some googling and realized there were a LOT of things that were not in that version, I got it for PC. It was one of the best decisions I have made.

Lots and lots of great mods to help make the flow a bit better, but even without them, it's a great game. My city-building skills are always increasing, and each time I play I learn what to prioritize based on my layout and goals. There really are endless things to create.

I do recommend buying DLCs (I can't stand playing without having Mass Transit installed), but they go one sale often enough that you can nab them when they do. Many of them have additions that make gameplay easier or your infrastructure more efficient."
16211,Good game but it gets boring after some time
16212,I really really hate this game
16213,"Game is very good, but it would be better if you could interact within the game, for example: driving vehicles or an elecopter to see your city."
16214,"I've only spent a couple hours of my life playing this game, and I don't regret it at all. 

Big zen garden vibes for those who are good at the game and like to mod their city to get it just how they like it in terms of feel, roads, etc. This game has served as a way to relax, slow down, and have deep brown guy thinking time while listening to either ratchet trap music or chill beats.

I could see this game being frustration mode if you're not good at it or refuse to mod your game though!

16246,"Probably one of the best sim games, especially for city building. Only complaint is that the dlc is a little expensive at times"
16247,"Good game, get mods."
16248,"Big takeaway : Great game but the base game lacks depth. This seems to be a problem with most Paradox games, but mods, DLC, and creator content can give you endless hours of creative play.


I have always enjoyed city building games. I grew up on Sim City, Roller Coaster Tycoon and other Sim genres. After the last? SimCity release I was quite disappointed and looking for other developers in this market. Cities: Skylines was toted as the SimCity killer all through its development and is a great game in it's own right. I think at it's release in 2015 it was a fine game, but it became quite apparent it lacked the depth many had come to expect in this genre. Mods fixed a lot of that and eventually DLCs as well. 
So you are looking at City Skylines 6 years later in 2021. There is now 33 DLCs 10 of which are core content. I personally can't recommend the collection. There is just to much fluff. 
City Skylines at the base price is still probably a good buy at 30$ you will easily get 60hrs of game play with the base and mods. However, it's currently a steal at $8 on sale.
Now to the content DLCs. None are stinkers and New player bundle isn't bad, but I wish it was industries and parklife instead. You will probably want Industries, Parklife, Mass Transit, Campus, and After Dark eventually and only buy these on sale. Industries is probably the only one that has the depth to justify the full $15
Now for Sunset Harbor, Snowfall, Natural Disasters, Green Cities, and Concerts. These are going to come down to your play style. 
Sunset Harbor, and Snowfall have the distinction of adding transport content. Sunset isn't bad and probably a great buy on sale if you are into beaches. Snowfall is all around bland except it added trams which is pretty much a must have for any transport player.
Concerts on sale is a much better offer than it was at release. With that said you are paying music more than assets. If you think the 2 dollar radio stations are a steal than concerts if even better. 
Rest of the DLCs are fluff the content packs aren't bad persay but again going to be more to your budget/playstyle."
16249,"Great game, runs just about perfect with the DLC on my Mac. Played tons so far and excited to keep building cities! Definitely recommend checking out traffic mods if you find the traffic management aspect fun (as I do!)."
16250,"The game itself is really fun. It definitely nails a more in-depth Sim City vibe and is quite realistic. Almost too realistic at times. At points it feels as though you need to be an architect or an engineer to figure out how to fix things. 

Like, unless you understand how everything works and how putting one building here will block the roads, or how one decision effects the entire city, your city will constantly have problems. It's not exactly a good sign when I have to look up 30 minute Youtube tutorials on how to fix traffic.

Also, be prepared to spend money. Like all Paradox games, they squeeze the life out of you with an insane amount of DLCs.

In conclusion: Eh. Complicated but fun. Also, expensive."
16251,ITS A game you big big city 10outa ten  :)
16252,"i'm pissed i bought the game a day before it went on sale 
"
16253,One of the best City Builders there is
16254,"Perfect city planning game . 10/10 would recomend . Search for good mods , you will have more fun . Pick up the game whenever you like on sale or not , you will have a good chance of liking it."
16255,"Captivating gameplay for those into this genre. The hours will fly by as you strive to create a masterpiece! I enjoyed the way the game leads you into a comprehensible journey, with various consequences if you aren't careful with your imagination."
16256,The best City building game. On PC and with the steam workshop has made the game have endless possibilities.
16257,Great game...
16258,"The best game ever! Cannot wait for a new, updated version!"
16259,This game came a long way since my first city simulator (SC2000). It's great and the DLCs + Woorkshop make it a perfect simulator. It's addicting to simulator lovers.
16260,Great
16261,"A relaxing city-builder with potentially infinite replayability.

Cities Skylines offers a pleasant and uncomplicated city building experience, with a very active community of talented modders allowing for personal customisation of the already excellent base game. The game includes easy to use modding tools that allow anyone to create and upload their own content to the Steam Workshop.

The options available to the player allow for realistic cities with well-developed infrastructure or functional monstrosities that are more about efficiency than aesthetics. There's something very innovative about hydroelectric facilities powered by human waste. Some players also like to create highly detailed dioramas of areas or scenes, while others re-create real-life intersections that they upload to the workshop for players to use in their cities.

I'd recommend Cities Skylines to anyone looking for an interesting city builder without any pressure or particular difficulty, especially at the price it can drop to during sales. There are 9 main DLCs which add interesting features and allow systems in the base game to be expanded, but they certainly aren't necessary. The base game alone does feel complete. I would suggest starting with the base game to learn the basic mechanics before adding extra features and systems with DLC.

Performance-wise, the game runs well on my aging PC (i7 4790k, GTX 970 & 16GB DDR3 RAM) with all 9 DLCs and around 600 mods/assets. I used to have only 8GB of RAM, and the upgrade to 16GB had an immediate and significant impact on performance."
16262,Just started bought Skyline Extended. Need to figure out few things just find the meaning of left hand case. Trough was the drive direction. And lil confused with what i bought the basic with ....find 2 mail in this account. Mods play a part in game i see on YouTube. And assets figuring out the terms and stuff. Enjoy playing its like all in 1 game.....Like a kid cut play it and have fun and utter most Einstein would have fun. Anyways 2 days playing and already fan. Greetings from the netherlands
16263,"Oh no, the Ice Cube Factory burned down because I did not have Firedepartment coverage in that area."

"
16268,most amazing city builder to date!
16269,"SimCity is great because it is about the fun of balancing competing systems in a charming game. This game tries to ape SimCity but misses the mark. Sure, it's a hyper-detailed simulation but it's got no soul. And I never even found it really challenging. If you're goal is to build a giant city in a hyper detailed simulation that's visually impressive (from a technical lens) then this is the game for you. If you want to play an actually fun game then I'd recommend grabbing SimCity 4."
16270,good game
16271,"Good by itself, 
very good with all the DLCS, 
Awesome with DLCS and steam workshop content!"
16272,Fun
16273,super great game
16274,"Good game, but I wish they would provide us with more free content on the base game itself as the fun within it won't last long, and it feels incomplete. You will have to fork out more money in the end to get bits and bits of new updates through their many separate DLCs for the best experience which would very expensive."
16275,That the game very interactive and very fun building your own town to a city its highly recommended.
16276,.
16277,let's build a better world...one pixel at a time. Totally engrossing game.
16278,People are dying and it's all my fault 8/10

16287,"This games really simple and fun, at least until you get to the traffic bs.
A late game trap for first timers, now i know to build my cities with big ass roads.
But yeah id totally recommend as someone who never cares for these types of games.
Main issues are like after ur first city theres not much of a point to keep playing and make new cities, unless you wan't to go for achievements or try something new with another city but u know thats down to personal preference."
16288,"Still don't understand the bus route thing and tourist and so on.
"
16289,its a good game
16290,Good game. Challenging and relaxing. Garbages can be a pain in the ass.
16291,"It cost way to much to get a full game experience, unfortunately these guys take the same route as the sims 4. after coming out with dlc for so long its gotten so expensive, normally games start to do special editions, and dlc bundles at this point. sims 4 does not do this as they know faithful fans will buy it, and its the same here, the dlc is racking up and the price along with it, i cannot recommend this game as a base game, and i cannot recommend the price of a full game experience either.

TLDR: Too basic by itself, Too expensive for complete experience. trashy business model based off how EA has done the sims 4"
16292,nice city builder and with the sale its a good deal
16293,great game that has consumed 2900 of my hours

16296,i havent played in two years because i made a perfect city and dont want to ruin it
16297,"Im stuck in the paradox loading screen whenever i try to launch the game.

Tried reinstalling the game 4x already, updated all known drivers on my desktop and still wont run.

i just purchased it on steam for i have been playing this on epic games. then this shit happens. It ran on steam when i repurchased it, but when i bought dlcs, it just get stuck on paradox logo. 

can someone help me?"

Hope the next version will combine all these necessary mods to the native game program. Leaving some assets creation work to player communities is fine, while leaving all these work to players is just too much..."
16301,"Great city builder in the classic SimCity style, but with considerably more depth and customizability if that's what you're looking for."
16302,"There's always one game I come back to. When i've burned out on an MMO or get frustrated at a FPS, where do I end up? In the sweet Bosom of Cities Skylines. I swear I've been more hours into it than any of the other 400 games i've downloaded. It's so deeply engrossing and addictive. How many hours has this game claimed from my life because I lost all sense of the real world playing it?"
16303,"People on here are complaining about bare bones game. I personally would not pay the $30 or $40 price tag but no reason to complain if you can pick it up for less then $10 bucks, so get it with the discount while you can. Fun game to kill time and definitely worth it for the discount price, you will still get hours upon hours of fun game play."
16304,It's everything SimCity should be and more.
16305,"Very fun to play on days where you don't want to do much. One of my favorite games in my steam library, very poggers."

16318,build city then add every natural disaster then quit
16319,I like the fact that the cities are much larger than the area on Sim City
16320,"It's a great game and the sandbox nature leads to endless opportunities for fun. I haven't tried any of the Scenarios yet, but those should be a great way to get better aquainted with more advanced gameplay. My one gripe - and possibly a dealbreaker for some - is that this game is definitely a game where you need mods and the DLCs. And the DLCs are pricey."
16321,In this gmae you build a ctity ghgosts are shity
16322,"yes
"
16323,"Played this game for years but never actually reviewed before. It's awesome. The game will find every way possible to try and eff you up, you might spend 3 hours trying to fix a traffic issue at a highway junction only to create an even worse problem. It's the best city builder game there is, so if that's the kind of thing you like then it's an easy winner. 

Desperately waiting for Cities: Skylines 2 though!"
16324,very fun and addicting
16325,"good detail

16329,"Good city building game, however some super basic issues like blurry UI on 2K resolution are still present, which makes it unplayable for me as my eyes water and hurt. It used to be ok, but coming back to it after a few years, I basically couldn't play it because of that :("
16330,its very very good! anyone reading this send nudes and by nudes I mean photos of inside your gaming rig..
16331,its good but why does it always crash when i save
16332,This game makes me angry. But in all the right ways. You have your city flowing and growing spectacularly and then one clown decides to change lanes in the wrong place backing up traffic for miles. You spend the next three days trying to clear the traffic. What's not to love?
16333,"There are so many ways to play Cities: Skylines and this is one of the best qualities of this game.

You have the ability to choose how deep you manage the city, one might be satisfied with just a naturally random road system and a positive income to the budget, while the other person might see themselves as a powerful mayor with an energy to make everything perfect. Besides that, the easiness of mod managing the workshop brings is honestly amazing.

Every inch of the streets, amount of trees, the size of a concrete jungle - it's all in your hands."
16334,"Yes! This is what I've been looking for ever since SimCity got too old.
Works the same way. If you've liked SimCity, you'll love this game too!
"
16335,"make factory next to people 






china"
16336,"You make your own city, it's very fun!
Recommend downloading ""Green Citys"""
16337,"Absolutely fantastic, but the DLC makes this game complete and the total cost racks up too high for me. Completely vanilla, even with mods isn't the best experience."
16338,Amazing game. The music gets me back to 2016 vibes.
16339,"thanks steam

16340,DLC: The Game.
16341,Eminent domain goes brrrrrrt!
16342,love this game. first played it on the ps4.

>Traffic jams because you don't unlock highways until higher population

>Have to essentially start over once I unlock highways and larger roads

>Delete everything once I have everything I want unlocked to start fresh

>Forget how budgeting works

>Bankrupt because I deleted all my sources of income




10/10 would try again"
16344,I can't play this without mods any more
16345,addicting
16346,Big Time waster.  Fantastic
16347,"Simcity but way way way way way way 
it's good"
16348,play game and try to make a noice city but at the same time destroy it! mwahahahahahahah
16349,"great game, I put the hospital next to the coal power plant"
16350,roads.
16351,"nice game
"
16352,"Its not my favorite pricing model.  I don't care how good the game is, its not worth $212.00 for a complete experience."
16353,"I was a SimCity 4 player and waited for the SimCity 5 release. But SimCity 5 (despite its uniqeness and new gameplay option), offer very limited ways of what we can do in shaping our own city.
In short, if you miss SimCity 4 gameplay, Cities Skylines offers what you seek with a far more superior graphic quality and gameplay complexity with even much more option through its DLCs, assets, and mods.
Totally worth to buy the original, i assure you."
16354,"Great game to have a glass of wine/beer with. I would highly recommend it to anyone who ""doesn't have time for games"". There must be a strategy to it, but I just let the city run out of money, develop a drug problem, and then delete it...the circle of life."
16355,steam's making write a review so I can say I like this game
16356,you can torture people in very cruel ways which tends to be very stress relieving
16357,A+
16358,You can make actual cities!!!! and also you can make skylines!!!!! would buy again!! definitely!!!!!!
16359,Classic game
16360,"i really like the game so far but i do feel that if you dont have a lot of dlc the game will get boring quick. i do enjoy though but i do think that it is kinda dumb to have to pay for a lot of small dlc, but you gotta make money somehow"
16361,"Possibly one of the best City Builders out there.  You'e given a sandbox, a budget, and all open to your imagination."
16362,AI sucks sometimes but a fun game
16363,"Great game with endless possibilities.  Vanilla CS is alright, but mods make it an entirely different game.  If you are interested in tycoon games, simulations, and/or city management this is the game for you.  Beware of possible frame rate issues once you get to a high population (probably 150k citizens on vanilla, or 300k with the realistic population mod).  There are some items on the workshop that can aid with FPS, so I'd highly suggest you get those.  4.85/5 :)"
16364,"I havent got the game but its been on my wishlist the past year, get it on a sale like this for £5 as its a legendary game."
16365,Awesome game best city builder by far
16366,"Every single DLC released for this game should have been baseline features included with main game. Shameful. Typical of this publisher, though."
16367,Looks like a nice game :)
16368,"Definitely a HUGE upgrade from Sim City 2000 / 3000. I caught this game by accident when i was on YouTube and looking up interchanges and best traffic flow designs for my Design School and found out people had some kind of simulator. Low and behold this realistic simulator was actually a video game, and to my delight it was a remake for this modern day Sim City, a LOVELY game! There are so many things this game gets right.

However this game truly needs mods and assets to be workable outside the vanilla version to be truly enjoyable to solve cities beyond 15k population, unless you rig the game using pure AI hacks, which is not realistic.  You DEFINIELY need the TPME traffic mod and move-it, because the in-game default vanilla ones kinda rubbish.  Otherwise, VERY VERY creative game! Love it!"
16369,Very hard to understand the mechanics of the game but it is very addicting.
16370,"It is a time machine. If you're bored and want to lose 3 hours...play this and boom, the time is gone! In fact you'll probably lose more than 3 hours. Great fun! get on it!"
16371,EOS was added to this game long after release.
16372,It's fun to commit arson on a city
16373,"Takes some getting used to. I have finally built a huge city without being plagued by sickness or other disasters. Just did it very very slowly. Also set up regions early on and tested things like tax hikes on controlled areas. Also the money is there to be spent, so spend it on the residents ensuring all medical, educational and safety services are in place in ample supply. However I found tweaking the budgets for each was a way of not oversupplying services, and allowing you to make a profit without relying on loans.

Sickness was a particular frustration, because it often relates to factors other than how many hospitals you have. I found I'd accidentally placed a water pipe near a sewer outlet, but not before investing heavily in additional hospitals.

I'd like keyboard shortcuts for being able to quickly deselect roads in order to start a new road in a different place. Escape brings you out but using the mouse to go back in makes it painful. My other frustration is connecting stations. This is particularly fiddly and I was left with incomplete lines and no way of completing them.

One useful tip I found, is clicking on a vehicle and turning on tracking. This allows you to observe what it's like living and working in the city for one of your people (cims). Not only do you see traffic problems, but you'll spot other things awry on their journey.

It's a most addictive game and I'm still getting a lot out of it years on."
16374,"build this shitty

16375,u can build pp's from roads and have people live in your MAGNUM DONG
16376,"Cities: Skylines, a game, I like."
16377,"The base game without DLC is okay, but in Paradox fashion key gameplay features are locked behind expensive DLC. Mods fix many but not all issues with the game. Hate to recommend it because of the scummy DLC practices but I will anyway."

16384,This game is VERY good. Nice detailed city sim. Engaging for hours on end. Some of the DLC is hit or miss but can be fun in the right frame of mind.
16385,"This game is so relaxing! If you love building games you'll love this game :D
I do recommend using a few mods to make this game even more fun!"
16386,Great game to just pass the time. Recommend it to any city builder lovers.

The first city, it happened when i had atleast over a million dollars, and money went around 800K minus before the extiction reveresed. happened about 20 times back and forth, losing 10ths of thousands citizents. but last time i was working on a projekt and lost too many ppl and money so couldnt finnish the projekt, half of the city was without electrisity and the whole city was doomed. My last city was doing fine, 10K+ money a month and the city was expanding. The extinction hit and allways 2000 ppl at the hospital, killing many ppl and never got the population bk so i can earn money again. population varies between 8K to 9K, bankrupt with a depth of 1.6M.  city was doomed aswell, there was no coming bk."

16407,very fun and accurate FUCKING GOD simulator
16408,yes
16409,This is the best city builder currently on the market. DLC is always expanding the game but the base game is still very playable by itself. There is also a large modding community that helps expand the game features and cleans up a lot of the little annoyances that can crop up.

if you arent a city builder but want to give it a try i would also recommend this [and a bit of patience lol ] The community is pretty awesome, if you have questions search the discussion areas, chances are very high they're already answered but if not it will get answered ^_^ [ note: there are asshats everywhere, but most here seem pretty great to me]

if you don't like builder games, if you like action and get irritated easily, prooooooooobably not the game for you :)"

you can meticulously create your city street by street zoning, designing, the perfect balance of residential, industrial, and commercial, and design the perfect world.

OR

You can create a massive and oppressive city practically torturing thousands of innocent people, even calling upon the gods themselves to send disasters and destruction throughout the streets all while making a sick profit!"
16445,good game
16446,just a great game to lose yourself and just build!

16455,Overall a great game it has tons of mods and you can easily play this for weeks or even months without getting bored. There are a lot of dlc-s which cost which is bad but that is overshadowed by the game. highly recommend the game
16456,One of the best City building I've played.

16458,Good.
16459,Traffic jam simulator
16460,Hours and hours of fun and replayability
16461,"If you like SimCity, but don't like paying EA... all the mods make this game incredible. 

And the map editor makes things far more interesting. I can't tell you how many coastlines and fertile valleys I created and built up. Too many, if I'm being honest."
16462,"Masterpiece.
but only because of the community and mods.

16476,borg
16477,"Great city building game. The main objective is to create a transport system consisting of roads, railway lines, air travel and water transport. The biggest problem is the traffic which you have to manage using some mods or not building many road intersections. Apart from that its a very nice game."
16478,.
16479,an enjoyable game.
16480,Best city builder I've ever played
16481,"The game covers pretty much all the aspects needed for a city builder. Some DLC are also bringing nice added value.

I would mention though that it is a huge resource drainer and crashes quite often. :("

16484,its lit!

It does have a learning curve as there is a lot to micro-manage. But after some messing around you get the hang of it. I have some issues with it but I might just be picky."

16497, Great game if you can add more language
16498,"can be fun, but there appears to be quirky bugs related to the water system; when things appear to be hooked up they may not be. I can be a struggle to get a city going, but once it's established, there is enough budget to work around the hiccups."

16500,"Go watch a few youtube vidoes and/or twitch. if that looks good, would say buy it"
16501,"at the time of review this is still the best city builder out there, even 6 years after release. A must have if you own a computer."
16502,Very cool simulator. I chuckle at comments that it ultimately becomes a traffic manager game because imo t's kinda true.
16503,"fantastic graphics and tons of ways to do things wrong, so very challenging"
16504,it good
16505,I have loved this game for years.
16506,"Once again, you buy only 40% or less of the game with the rest locked behind dlc

16511,very fun game when your bored
16512,"Nice game, endless potential through modding, overrated money grab dlc's that should have been in the base game. Does not have the same artistic, graphic or complex aspects of Simcity 5. Get it on SALE ONLY!"
16513,"been playing since it came out on console, now moved to pc. 10/10"

16515,Highly recommended. Please don't play the vanilla version. I warned you.
16516,love it
16517,yes
16518,Absolutely love this game and the mod community.
16519,Great city builder. The Steam Workshop has every customization you can think of and has continued to keep the game relevant.
16520,"It's a fun game and i really really really like it. **ALTHOUGH there are some big problems:**

- The game is quite car-centric and without mods cycling and pedestrian infrastructure is almost nonexistant. There are also no zonable bus-only-ways or tram-only-ways besides roads but this can be fixed with mods.

+ The game has a lot of public transit options and you can radically decrease cars on your roads with them and even more so with TM:PE and other mods.

- I find myself using several modded roads because of the lack of roads for example with combined tram- and bus lanes or a road with trams+bike lanes

- Trams and trolleybuses can't intersect (they can irl google it)

+ Even though i find the game often lacking, the modding community is thankfully active and even when playing in vanilla the game can take me for several hours on end and make me really enjoy building my very own cities"
16521,"if you like to build or craft a city, this game is worth it. not only you could create a city, you also got to destroy it."
16522,"What sim city always should have been. The game is immense, in depth and detailed. The community is such a vast resource this game is endless in its level of detail. Hours and hours can be spent detailing just one section the the city and its so satisfying to see it all work"
16523,Magnificent city sim with detailed services and good traffic simulation
16524,"I've never left a review before, but I can safely say that this game is highly recommended. I've spent so long trying to make the perfect city  and through my human error, I have yet to reach it. I will not stop until i create the greatest utopia ever. This game will get you lost in its detail and fun gameplay. For anyone wondering whether or not they should get the game, you should. You definitely should."
16525,it good to torture citizens
16526,"city skylines is a very good game, better than Anno 1800 - KillaKhalilKing 2021"
16527,Great city builder with tons of mods to keep you hooked
16528,"Keeps you engaged & drawn in to grow cities from a small village into a thriving metropolis. I would highly recommend investing in some YouTube tutorials as the amount of systems to manage can be daunting, but it keeps me hooked months after purchase. 9/10"
16529,very gud
16530,"Big fan of the game, however I cannot recommend it as it uses Epic Online Services despite being almost entirely single player which just raises some awkward questions: We know it tracks user data and is ostensibly there to improve MP experiences, so why is it in a SP game if not *purely* to track userdata? 

It really sucks, Simcity went anti-consumer and now Cities Skylines is. Guess I'll just be playing Simcity 4 until the end of time."
16531,sjits dope as f
16532,"Love the whole game concept, like the old Sim City.  Definitely needs the Finite Road Tool and Roads Anarchy enabled to make play more fun, though.  And a few more highway interchange options would be useful."

16557,"This game... This goddamn game. Everyone eventually finds their favorite way to unwind after a long day. For me, it's booting this game up, fixing traffic issues, building pathways, and landscaping. Though I did play Sim City a bunch when I was younger, I left city building sims behind for years until a friend recommended this game to me.

Please note, my play time should more accurately be in the hundreds, possibly thousands of hours I've played since 2016, but that was not on Steam. If you're looking for action and heart pounding adrenaline, this isn't for you. But if you like solving problems and watching your vision come to fruition, then for all that is holy, this might be dangerously for you.

Pro Note: Mod this game. You don't need every asset pack in the world, but Move It, Traffic Manager: President Edition, and Nod Controller alone take this game in to the stratosphere."

16590,"The only thing that could make it better is more involvement with the citizens - perhaps even scenario style citizen interactions that affect the city in some way.

anyway - been playing city sims since...well....long before there was internet. And this one takes the cake."
16591,awesome game
16592,Cool
16593,"The game is mostly very fun and satisfying.

I had a very exciting moment when my hydroelectric dam caused the river and nearby lake to completely dry up, which provided most of my city's electricity. The city began to fall apart as people abandoned their homes and left in the thousands. Almost immediately I was bankrupt. I took a loan from a bank, which provided barely enough funds to demolish the dam, flood the lake and river again, and build new solar / wind power infrastructure. Power was restored, and the city came back from the brink of becoming a ghost town.

But, about four hours after that event, my game crashed. It had completely failed to initiate any kind of auto-save. I have lost several *hours* of progress, and the last manual save was when my population was half of the current build. A complicated, efficient system of highways into and out of my city is utterly gone. It's been a week now and I still feel no need to go back and restart all the hours of progress that got wiped. I'm probably not going to play the game again.

This has been my experience with Cities: Skylines. Up to you whether this sounds like something you want to try out."

16611,"My ""city"" was nothing more than a Somerset town during heavy rainfall. It was flooded with sewage not water though."
16612,"Cities, The best city building sim on the market. If you plan to play, plan to snag every DLC pretty quickly as you see the need. Just, trust me, commit to it early in your mind. Then play for a few hundred hours in vanilla. Seriously. You can feel out the items that are lacking for you. The gameplay you wish was this way or that. Then, head on over to the massive workshop and community. And At this point you have freedom to know what you like and need from workshop. It can be easy to basically shop until your game breaks. But you're not that guy pal. I could give you my working subscription list and might in a collection. But You, should build what's right for you. Get LOM(Load Order Manager) AND while outdated the Mod Compatibility checker has great info to show you where to start fixing mod conflicts(but it is not current). Lastly get  the Loading screen mod. With those 3 you can build the game that's right for you. The discord has a google doc with a more updated albeit manual list of broken, and incompatible mods. For reference, knowing nothing about modding Cities, I got it all good in a few hours once I had that info and tried for Much longer beforehand. Do Not One Click Subscribe To Lists. GLHF. Also every time the game updates it breaks mods. Always Unsub from all and resub to the mods that get updated. Use the Favorite button to save mods to see later after you unsub from them easily."

16625,"City Skylines is a great city Builder game, but they really should of added the dlc's to the base game. Then it would feel more like the full game. However it is a great game and you can easily get sucked into playing a few hours at a time while time goes fast. I would recommend buying it on sale as without the dlc's I feel $40 is not worth"

16687,"Fun game so far, the only and biggest critique that I think we all have is the blatant cash cow this game is, theres around maybe 15ish DLC's all costing $15 each. Some/ most of these DLCs should have been free content. Things like the parks I understand but a lot of these DLCs arent worth the $15 and if you wantthe full experience you end up paying well over $100 even above $200. Either buy the game and 2-3 DLC on sites like CDkeys where you get a decent discount or just pirate the game, If you want to support them go ahead but these greedy practices are honestly repulsing, Shit company, good game."

"
16715,"The best city builder on the market as of right now. And by playing it on PC, you're opening yourself up to infinite replayability with mods."
16716,"I have probably played this game 20-30 times, and I really want to like it given its reputation as the ""Simcity killer,"" but the fact is that in some ways the game is TOO realistic. For one, that means the game doesn't have that wow factor of feeling your city get bigger – it just sprawls and even downtown areas just seem slightly taller than ho-hum suburbs. For another thing, there are so many small little mistakes that can end your entire city. So just as you're getting absorbed into the game, there is some small problem – a fuel truck stuck in traffic, a water route that gets inadvertently severed, etc. – and if you don't catch it right away, the game is irreversibly over. Everyone moves out and you go bankrupt. Which means you are severely punished if you actually start getting into the game and haven't saved every 10 minutes. Every other sim game has at least *some* degree of forgiveness. 

4/10. If I wanted to enjoy ""realistic"" city management I'd run for mayor. I want to play a game."
16717,"A very addicting game that I could spend forever on. There are plenty of features that could keep you busy for hours. What isn't there can be added with some amazing mods. There are some things I have issue with though. The DLC adds many valuable features but is overpriced if you want to have everything. The traffic simulation is impossible to work with in a high density area without the use of mods. It takes a lot to run this game computer-wise. TMPE is extremely important to make traffic flow well. Even with the downsides previously mentioned, this game is incredible. You can customize almost anything. Modding is supported and almost anything can be added with mods that already exist. From cosmetic to building to fixing many problems, mods are your friend. Things are easy to find once you're in game and its plainly just fun. It is infinitely replayable where you can do anything. Make a poop volcano and ruin your citizens lives RTgame style? Check. Create a massive sprawling city with 1 million pop? Check. Road anarchy making roads look as weird as the traffic ai is? Check. Definitely my favorite city builder game. For DLC mass transit, industry, park life, and campus are go to. Natural disasters and green city are also amazing. Everything else is a definite wait for sale. All in all I would rate 9/10. I just hope my roads stop looking like spaghetti whenever I try to make my own intersection."

"
16733,"465 hours. That's how long it took me to get myself to make a review... well that's wrong, I was just too lazy to write one at the time. Anyway, down to business.

(SHORT VERSION) Just buy it if you love simulation sandbox games, especially if you want one with a huge and diverse workshop.


Cities: Skylines is one of the best simulation games on the store. I can not get enough of it. While, sometimes it can turn into loading screen simulator or even crash simulator, that is ALWAYS the cause of mods and proves that the base game can do some amazing things on it's own. The two things I am most impressed about though, is the community and the graphics. We'll start off with graphics. Where do I even start!?! It feels like I am just a drone randomly placing buildings against roads in with the graphics of my own eyes in the real world. It feels like I am truly there when I zoom in super close to the ground. The community: I can't say that I have found a better community than C:S' community. If you have the simplest of all questions, to some crazy complicated coding, 9/10 times you will get your answer. Overall, this game is definitely going to be staying on my games list. Thank you for your time."

16781,"Not for the casual simmer! This is a mix of real time strategy and endless layers of micromanagement combined with a slick AI the allows you cities to ""grow"" organically. I would not recommend this game for newbies, there is far too much to keep track of. However, if you were looking for a version of SIm Cities on steroids, this is your game. It's a steep learning curve and I recommend spending time with the base games before attempting to add mods. There is great user created content available in the Steam Workshop  once you become comfortable with the game play and basic city management. Happy City Building!"
16782,This game is absolutely amazing
16783,it's a good game but once you have a few mods it gets glitchier than cyberpunk 2077

16789,"Great ""successor"" to the Sim CIty franchise (even if they're not related). Everything you wanted Sim City to become before it went off the rails. The game is beautifully rendered and has a robust modding community/active workshop to allow for endless customization. If you like city-builders this is at the top of the food chain. The only con--a minor one unless you're obsessed with realism--is that (understandably) the game limits the amount of assets on each map, meaning that from day one your new city has a finite and very reachable cap on buildings, trees, cars, props, etc that are allowed to appear, including the population of your city. That population will not appear realistic to the visual size of your city; it can look like Manhattan or Tokyo but cap out at a few hundred thousand people. There are mods that can fudge pop count displays for the sake of immersion, but ultimately you have a very reachable limit. My advice is to keep your dense city-center small, and sprawl out with your suburbs, fields, farms and parks to fill your map--otherwise you may find your city abruptly ending with no more asset space. While the vanilla game can/will run smoothly with the recommended hardware, it's highly recommended (especially if you plan to dive into the modding/workshop) that you have a powerful machine, as the number of high poly/pixel assets on the screen can really slow you down if you're a detail-oriented builder. 

Long story short; go for it."
16790,"They've added the ""Paradox Launcher"" as a step to launch the game, which in itself is annoying. Luckily it seems that my network-wide adblocker traps whatever data they are trying to capture.
But I just got a new screen, and the launcher breaks the launch parameters you could set in steam, to make it run at 3860x1600.

I won't be running this game again. I bought something, and they broke the use of it with an update."

16792,Awesome
16793,"The core game is very good and allows users to enjoy it at a level comfortable to them.  However, as users want to expand/customize their play the interface between the game and the community developers (mods, assets, etc.) results in many incompatibilities and system issues.  For example, if a new mod or asset is added to a game and the game crashes, it is not easy to identify which download was the cause.  With dozens or hundreds of downloads, it is a mathmatical nightmare to diagnose."

16807,"[h1]The perfect city builder[/h1]
[b]Cities: Skylines[/b] is a masterpiece, and is a sensational take on the city-building genre. It leaves behind Sim City and its predecessors, and is still a fun game to play even after 6 years due to its constant updates and new DLCs. The graphics are decent enough and the performance is acceptable, though, bigger cities may even make the best rigs out there suffer.

This city builder is not just a ""click-to-win"", you actually have to make strategic decisions, which may sometimes get boring for people as these ""strategies"" are generally related to road planning. If you are not the type of person that just wants to sit back and try to figure out how to clear traffic and manage road networks, you should probably think twice before purchasing this game.

When you start off your first city and get hit with traffic management issues, you would definitely be confused, as this game takes practice to master. So, stay patient and enjoy the ride!"
16808,One of the best simulation games to the date. There is something so satisfying about watching your city grow!

16810,trying to perfect your transit system is addictive
16811,I spent 43 on this game so far. 10/10
16812,Yes
16813,"Cities: Skylines is awesome fun and i think its the polar opposite of sims which i really like, its hard to get a start going. the community mods such as intersections are really helpful for expanding your city"

16815,Yes
16816,"HA HA flooding go BRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRR
"
16817,You can't be lose if there are no elections. 10/10.
16818,"Fantastic game held back by Paradox's infamous release strategy:
Release half of the game at a regular price and divide the other half into 10 DLCs at the same price of the base game.

It truly is an amazing game since it's the closest to a perfect city sim but dude Paradox really..

+ Modding community is goated"
16819,addiction.
16820,
16821,This was a pretty good game since I am coming from fucking simcity.
16822,"I love watching people play this game. I am trying my own hand at it, to see what cool cities I can begin to create!"
16823,soooooooooooooo GOOD
16824,"_
"
16825,"Become you own mayor , build you city connect it to other citys or friends citys. amazing game.  special if you liek the building process and put water pipes and infrastruct..in the games"
16826,Very cool
16827,i will forever love this game
16828,"amazing city building game with a great great modding comunity, taffic can suck but its still countless hours of fun"
16829,"This game is bad, It play's the tutorials everytime you start a new game even if you know how to play. The game does not let you have like half the things because, it's locked from you unless you pay."
16830,Cities Skylines is my drugs lol
16831,"Ive had this since it came out, the core game is meh, and it shines for a little with mods. That is until they update the game and break all the mods. A lot of the community mods are poorly made or dont work right anymore because they worked before they added another DLC that makes them obsolete or not work - like when they added nightlife, non of the modding building had lights that turned on so when it became night the city looked like North Korea and all the building were dark as if the city had a power outage; only fix -> hope the modder is still modding or uninstall it., and if you have a city that has a lot of dependencies on mods that you have been building for years like I have, makes it really difficult to remove them. I finally rage quit this game when the save button defaults to naming it new save and playing on a new game and saving it overwrote months of work."
16832,"This is a wonderful game. While I personally prefer the retro aesthetic of SimCity 4, Cities: Skylines is an amazing re-imagining of the city building genre."
16833,"I have spent so many hours on this game on this account and others its almost unreal, and im still excited to play over new games that I have bought."
16834,"City Simulator
10/10"
16835,gud
16836,The Sim City I always wanted.
16837,Its a good steady rate of progression that is hit with a sudden end to progress.
16838,Amazing
16839,Game cant hold 1000 mods but everything else is good
16840,great game!
16841,Best pure city builder game ever!
16842,Best city builder since Sim City 3000. I've been searching for a good building sim for years and can now finally say that I have found what I have been looking for. The game is great and the building can be as simple or as complicated as your play-style demands. The sound track is stunning and the fake ads that play prove to be a hilarious brake from the grind of my trying to figure out why the citizens keep getting sick. 10/10
16843,YAY
16844,yea
16845,"very fun
"
16846,awesome modding community
16847,the digital equivalent of a model train table
16848,"Better than SimCity. It's quite addictive, and generally quite fun, so 8/10. Too many DLC."
16849,Fun and adicitive modern city building game. Exactly the type of game I enjoy.
16850,learn to hate traffic in a whole new way
16851,great city builder
16852,unable to recover old account after reinstall
16853,"this game is a black hole that sucks you in. Even when you are away from it you will be thinking about your fake city. Every second of your day will be devoted to playing or even thinking about  this. I can no longer concentrate in anything because of my severe addiction, non stop thinking about layouts and solutions. I have no other responsabilities except the ones in my fictional city. Overall very good 10/10"
16854,"its good, but only with dlcs and mods"
16855,traffic management. that is all.
16856,"nice

16857,the 300 dollar game

16862,The game is very well done and very realistic! it has everything you need to build a city or a village! the maps are very big to have enough space for everything you want to create :D. I recommend it
16863,Great game
16864,more update to more fps
16865,"Bless me, I have been installing and uninstalling game over and over. 
It's so addictive I even forgetting my uni cws. In order to focus on smthing else I really need to uninstall it.
But imagining my saved files on some point, keep finding myself re-installing this game XD."
16866,good
16867,still a great game
16868,10/10 great game
16869,"Good fun, miles better than older city sims. Lots of customisation"
16870,Protip: Set an alarm before playing this game so you don't forget to eat.

16878,Colossal Order are the actual gods of city tycoons. A must have game!
16879,Classic Sim City 2000 vibes...  Highly recommended...  need some dlc tho if you want to get the most out of the game...

16888,"Game itself is fun, however keeps crashing after an hour of play and there's no autosave!!

5600x, 3070ti, 32gb ram.

Would refund it but brought the game for a quid so can't really complain. still, uninstalling and probably never playing again"
16889,Yes.
16890,AWESOME
16891,Very nice casual game love everything about it. good for starters but also alot once your city gets going for experts. good customization too!
16892,"a well designed game with constant updates with as well as new community designs daily via the workshop, the only down side is, personally sometimes when using mods and getting your city to a certain size, where you save the game and close it, and go to re-open it, and then not being able to open it(only happens with mod from my personal experience, but i'll have to test it on my newly built pc"
16893,"I've always been interested in city sims, but struggled to get in to them. Most of my efforts have ended in disaster. With Cities: Skylines, there was so many accessible tutorials online I felt more confident than ever. I tried the vanilla game I'd had for ages and really enjoyed it. Within a week I had bought a bunch of DLC to let me make my green town a reality.

So much fun, such a great stress reliever. Would strongly recommend if you like order and structure blended with creativity and beauty."
16894,"its really fun, the best city building game out there."
16895,jnysurgaer
16896,"fun and challenging, even without all dlc"
16897,"This game is just amazing with the things you can do in it 
"
16898,Playing this game is like my virtual Zen garden. I love starting it up and just relax as I tend to my city and help it grow.
16899,"The game itself is fun, but having a computer that can run mods and assets from the workshop definitely makes the game more enjoyable. Playing vanilla is still fun and playable, but it can be frustrating at times with the way the mechanics work, so having something that fixes those problems is a literal game changer."

16901,soup
16902,This is the sim city you are looking for
16903,nice
16904,men
16905,The feeling of playing god on the streets of your own town that you created is worth the price.
16906,great game never got bored
16907,nice
16908,"An addictive game but I have come to hate it. It's overly tempermental. I try to play with Mods and it wont load my map, I disable every MOD and it still wont load my map. It's even been glitchy in Vanilla mode. It's too bad because it had a lot of nice features. It's not my computer, because I tried it on two different machines, both with great specks. In the end it's just frustrating. I give up."
16909,"I completed the vanilla game (Megalopolis) in about 12-hours of active game-play, 32 hours total if I count the AFK time. The game-play gets quickly repetitive and overall, the game feels a bit like a DLC trap.  There are over 30 DLCs and they are not cheap.   I think it is a good game if you like to build pretty cities but there isn't much of a challenge for a hard-core gamer such as myself.  The game feels highly polished but a bit simplistic for my taste.  Add more roads, add more zoning as per demand, meet the needs of education, health and death care, garbage, etc. and you'll achieve Megalopolis after a few hours.  The surface area (terrain tiles) on which you build your city is a bit limited so it doesn't seem possible to build gigantic cities with millions of citizens.  I think the game is more about optimising the space you have and making it look pretty.  On the positive side, the hydrodynamics are fascinating and the terrain manipulation tools are very slick.  Unfortunately, I cannot recommend the game because the price feels unjustified for the number of hours it took me complete the game, at which point it felt very repetitive.  I'm a bit disappointed."
16910,hahah terrorism
16911,Good game
16912,cool game
16913,Always a good relaxing back-up when you're waiting for a new game or just need some chill time.
16914,It is good.
16915,"Meow. Meow meow meow, meow meow - meow? MEOW. meow meow....

MEEEEOOOWWWW - meow meow.

10/10 meow."
16916," cccc cvcvcvcvcvvvvccvvvcvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvj,bg , bv"
16917,Granted most paradox games beat you to death with micro transactions. It is still a very fun and addictive game. The add-ons are amazing and help with things like traffic.
16918,Very Enjoyable
16919,someone died in the elementary school
16920,a
16921,fun as heck
16922,"Do you like building? Do you like being a dictator? Do you like flooding homes and business with raw sewage? Then download Today! But in all seriousness, this game is fun and entertaining thanks to the dedicated community. If your looking for a city builder this is your best bet. Have fun playing :)"
16923,"Paid ""DLC""......just include these vital updates to the base game!! like 130$ for what should already be in the game, come on guys...."
16924,"It's Sim City 2000, but better."
16925,The base game is great and then the mods and DLC add an enormous amount of content and depth for experienced players. Low stakes gameplay makes for an enjoyable time.
16926,"Very addicting game, decent graphics, plenty of potential. 
the amount of DLCs is really annoying, but other than that I have very few complaints. 
9/10"
16927,It's a good city building game. You can spend hours making a beautiful city and have it look magnificent. And then cry when a meteor and a tornado come in a ruin everything. Worth it every time.
16928,yes
16929,Lucas is stupid lmao
16930,masterpiece
16931,"I now drive around my city taking notes of roadway anarchy and development, seeing how close residential areas are to business/industrial, this game has actually changed how i see the world.  11/10 would buy, fun times all around."
16932,"After several years and hour on hours of playing on the Xbox I've finally made the transition to buy a PC and this game solely because of the mods. GAME CHANGER, I know it cost me a bit but I really enjoy this game and the PC version has taken my city building to another level. I love to get detailed with my cities and now I am able to do whatever I would like. Highly recommended! 5 Stars"
16933,"The detail of this game is crazy! Very resource-heavy, but once you see what it can do it makes sense. Great game."
16934,"i awas unknowlahgead 
a/
thereasfore i killad milliaons of peaople"
16935,"Your first 1-2 hours of this game will probably be a little frustrating, as there's no tutorial, a steep learning curve, and lots of info screens to navigate. After that...you'll have a brilliant time. I've been playing a couple of weeks and already have invested in some DLC and a number of the top community mods. Awesome game that I feel I've barely begun to scratch the surface of, and will no doubt sink scores more hours into."
16936,"As soon as I get a city of decent size, the game crashes on launch, crashes while loading, and crashes while saving. I give up"
16937,It's a very nice game and u can really work with your creativity
16938,"It's fun but the game doesn't explain to you how to farm other resources like wood, food or oil"
16939,You will play this game with Mods. Then you will enjoy true power and forget time.
16940,"Super addictive, and with M1 I can now play it on my MacBook too, not just PC."
16941,Being able to design a city that is truly functioning (and with transportation routes) has been a dream I have had since I was a child.
16942,"I love City Builders. I am not good at them by any means but they are something I use to unwind from a long work week. I can sit down, open up Cities: Skylines and enjoy for hours on end. It definitely is a challenge to build a decent city without money cheats or the 81Tiles mod. If you watch Biffa, CPP, Two Dollars Twenty, or any of the other big name YouTubers, you can get a good grasp on how the game works and how to build your dream city. I highly recommend this game for anyone that wants stress free fun."
16943,"great city building game! 
needs basic mods to make it realisitic and to gain control over options.
but would reccomend"
16944,"To be honest, this is not a fun game, this is not an entertaining game, this is not even an actual game. You won't enjoy playing this, but you will always try to fix that damn traffic problem that's been bringing down your entire city to 60% or less. That pursue for solutions and problem solving, that pursue for perfection, is what this game does better than anything else."
16945,"Fun, easy to get into"
16946,You know it's published by Paradox when the base game is 30$ and the DLCs add up to 200$.
16947,good stuff my man
16948,yes
16949,best city sim out there
16950,Nice and very mod friendly
16951,noice
16952,vewwy najs
16953,nice
16954,"Pros: It others you to have the chance to create a city of your dreams and to even re create some real life cities. It is fun and there are a lot more things you can do with the DLCs and Mods, though they do take up a lot of space.

Cons: It can be a bit slow depending on computer and a bit hard to use especially if you aren't tech savy but if you have a good computer with lots of storage and RAM it shouldn't be a problem."
16955,ไนไ
16956,cool game
16957,hmmm big citi
16958,build city dump sewage on citizens
16959,"One day, people were driving into the middle of nowhere. There were plains nearby a river and a hill, the weather was fine, the soil was fertile, and lumber, oil, ore and fish were abundant. Almost like if they had been dreaming, alas they were very much awake. Soonafter, others followed them and settled as well. They built some roads, laid their houses, set up their shops and a couple of industries; and the place soon became a tiny hamlet.

With a lot of effort, and some bank credit, they managed to charter the town, which later developed into a full-sized city, with highways, traffic, crime, noise and polution. The local government, which had fallen into the hands of some oligarch, somehow admitted that they had failed misserably in managing the area, so they held elections and put their brains to work to develop a master plan, so their beloved city could once again be prosperous and desireable.

They planted some trees, they de-zoned that ugly tall buildings and made a large strip park along the main boulevard. Corruption was prosecuted, the services were optimised... and they even had time to plan cycling-routes next to the main roads and avenues. So, tourists and new citizens and businesses began to arrive...

When had all these things happened? In just 31 hours of gameplay. What could happen after we decide to build that shiny new airport?"
16960,I killed everyone in my city with sewage. perfecting roads and micro managing streetlamps & garbage cans. 10/10 would recommend.
16961,Its all good til traffic hits you where it hurts.
16962,Good
16963,addictive!
16964,So much fun
16965,Gud gam
16966,Create depressing horrible tax haven slums....
16967,perfecting roads and micro managing streetlamps & garbage cans. 10/10 would recommend.
16968,LOVE IT
16969,very fun
16970,Cities: Skylines? more like how do roads work. heh
16971,good game
16972,"ALL SHALL BOW BEFORE THE MAYOR...

With a city simulator that I quite enjoy the in-depth game engine and interfaces."
16973,i like city :D
16974,Great game
16975,great game
16976,Famine
16977,Wow. The level of detail is insanely good!
16978,It's like Sim City but better.
16979,":-) good, fun, and relaxing!"
16980,"All the other reviews cover the pros and cons extensively. Got this for free through PSN and played it to death, I saw the possibilities with all the mods on PC and switched over. Worth it!"
16981,"very good, I don't go outside anymore because this game is so addicting"
16982,It's just fun to play. That's my review.
16983,"Its fun
"
16984,"Pretty fun overall, keeps your mind busy and passes the time."
16985,"The majority of citizens died because of a huge traffic jam :)
10 hours in a traffic jam of 10"
16986,"I haven't even played for that long, but I can say that this game is awesome. You can design your dream city and transform it into a bustling metropolis, or, and this is what I think is better, you can build a huge city and then flood it, or cut off electricity. This game has something for everyone, so I highly recommend it to creative people who want to have fun."
16987,Its a great game. One of the best Tycoons-Simulators.
16988,Cool city building game but be warned you will get bored within 2 days then play again after 2 months
16989,I like the interface compared to other city simulation games
16990,cool
16991,A+
16992,"its great if you like building cities. if you want this game, i recommend mods like find it 2 and move it. anyways, great game."
16993,
16994,everythinh
16995,mto foda
16996,good city simulator
16997,"Great and hugely expansive game that still frustrates you (in a good way) if you try to take too many shortcuts to make a city too quickly. Each map and new city is challenging which is why I keep coming back to playing another 8 hour session that just flies by. Graphically it is brilliant. The workshop full of assets, maps and mods is a great resource to further add to the game, but beware not to overload your system with too many or the game will collapse, so choose wisely. To me, this is everything I wanted SimCity to be all those years ago - I highly recommend it."
16998,"GOOD GAME <3
"
16999,This game will make you go insane at how the traffic flows in your city. 10/10 would play again
17000,"Can be overwhelming, with the amount of content but it's basically like Sim City without the cheesy/campiness of it all. When you get a big city really flowing/working, it feels good."
17001,God game 10/10
17002,"love it
"
17003,good
17004,I recommended to my dad because my dad likes city building / sandbox games!
17005,I drowned 7k people in sewage
17006,Best modern city sim out there. Worth trying even without any DLC.
17007,This game has all of the tools to create a well working city!
17008,"it is fun
"
17009,"Somewhat difficult when first starting and learning the ways of the game, but very immersive and well thought out game."
17010,Fix the Traffic!
17011,I've been playing along time now and love it. cant wait for more options in the next game
17012,help
17013,Love this game!!!
17014,"Great city planner game, huge variety of mods to tailor the gameplay too!"
17015,I enjoy killing time with this game. Sometimes I play for hours at a time because it's very entertaining.
17016,"i like the game just pls put in muliplayer that would be awsome

17017,very nice
17018,I love this game and mods make it way better too. i highly recommend this game to anyone who likes games...
17019,gud
17020,"Honestly, this is a great game. However, sometimes the game crashes and I can't play it. Other than that, it's a great game. It's worth the 30 dollars. :)"
17021,Very fun and quite addictive. My favourite game.
17022,good
17023,Perrrty fun
17024,What an amazing game :) I recommend the walk and drive mod.
17025,Amoing us
17026,I can kill people.
17027,yes
17028,nice
17029,Great game and once you start playing ... you just can't stop ;)
17030,Game does not work with Windows11
17031,"Great city building sandbox game. It has many mods and customization items, along side standard things. Also has good DLCs and Scenarios to play through."
17032,good
17033,One of my favorite games!
17034,"I turned off mods to try and obtain an achievement.  Once I did that the game went to hell in a hand basket.  When ever I tried to attach a new building to a road it would not connect to the road hence no trucks would exit.  I was not able to pick up trash in the city very strange.  Delete roads, moved recycle-rs, redid roads, added garbage dumps, no trucks, wow.  It made me feel like game was unplayable without mods.  Now I cant get achievements to work because mods that are supposedly turned off are still on somehow. Now I have to delete the mods to get the achievements to work fun fun fun."
17035,"This game offers a chance to use your imagination. There are countless modifiers every step of the way that make game play somewhat challenging, yet exciting. Highly recommend this game for someone who likes to build, and perfectionists. Let your imagination go wild."
17036,"poo volcano

17037,epic
17038,I love this game! It's so relaxing to me!! Creating cities (and even destroying them) Is just a blast for me! With mods as well adding custom content just wow! I've always loved this game when even playing on the Xbox Version of it. I would 100% Recommend this to others!
17039,good
17040,The best cities builder simulator
17041,"My suggestion:
1. Keep an eye on the traffic.
2. Build densely, don't leave vacant land between buildings.
3. Unique buildings are not necessary if you don't want to lose money.
4. Choose roads wisely, don't all go that 6-lane one."
17042,infinite posibillities and i love the special buildings and over 100 achievements i'll give it about 84% upvotes
17043,"Great game, but if your going to buy it, you need to have atleast 1 DLC, to fully enjoy the game, preferably the natural disaster DLC."
17044,"If You Like Relistic City Building Games This Is For Ypu
"
17045,"NEEDS MODS like traffic manager, good way to spend a lot of time
I recommend watching Biffa's vid's"
17046,Simcity gud gama i like
17047,"Much better than sim city. However, I wish the disaster DLC would have more disasters and hypothetical diseases etc. I wish there was perhaps a DLC that would introduce protests and more government functions. That aside the game is great."
17048,fun intreseting idk?
17049,10/10 would cause massive road backups again.
17050,"  kl,l,,l,ml"
17051,cool

17053,omg yes iim so enjoy playing this game but i recommends use dlc but not the radio one
17054,i dislike steam requiring me to type stuff in here.
17055,is gud
17056,game good
17057,"Good game...
Im just bad at it."
17058,"By far the best city builder, only made better by great workshop support."
17059,good bridge simulator
17060,good game
17061,Fun game and really enjoyable to customize your city and manage it all carefully
17062,Good
17063,saadsdsasdads
17064,"Great fun, better than Sim City in almost every aspect"
17065,"This game is Super Fun. You can create Your Own Cities and I just feel like it is Very Fun. If it doesn't seem Fun to You, too bad. You'll be missing out on The Fun of creating a City. Download Today, even though it's Pricy, costing $30 to Install."
17066,forever classic
17067,"I love Skylines, it's a very addictive and extremely satisfying game to play. Has plenty of content and mods. Works well with no bugs I have ever ran into and provides hours of playtime. Doesn't really have an end point so can just keep going endless hours. Great value."
17068,"The best city builder you can find anywhere at anytime.
Hope they release a sequel fixing bugs and giving us more freedom to modelate and create new cities and assets."
17069,1
17070,"Super fun game. I'm terrible at the ""real"" game, I just like building cool cities. But it is a really high quality game."
17071,"Awesome game. If you are a Sim City Fan, this is a must!!!!"
17072,Great
17073,:D
17074,Cities: Skylines is one of those games where the base game alone is incredibly fun.
17075,good gaem verry gud gaem recomend
17076,"A very great game overall, Mods can be difficult to grasp and possibilities are endless. You feel like, ok this mod is the last one I will need then you will see others are way ahead of you in terms of realism. You don't have to aim or play the game with mods too. Probably THE BEST CITY BUILDER Out there, Mods make it 100x times better."
17077,Good.
17078,"Great game, and Mods make it even better"
17079,very poggers
17080,"the DLCS are a bit over priced some are 11pounds when they are most likey worth 5-6 pounds
"
17081,It just quits since I updated tp OSX Mojave
17082,"Way better than Sim City. Traffic can be hard but if you look up a few tutorial videos, it's no problem at all"
17083,this game very good made me cum multiple time
17084,
17085,so cool but the cims look weird and this is so cool. i accidently turned on unlimited money while enabling all meh mods so happy mistake YAY.
17086,Best in depth city builder in my opinion.
17087,good game
17088,Watch a YouTuber guide you through your first few builds. It'll help.
17089,"from 2015 and still amazing
"
17090,Guys I TOTALLY hate this game like TOTALLY have not played it for over 300 hours nah this sucks ewwww so bad
17091,"Everything was going amazing for this game, and I felt that I had found a good long term game to play. I have a world where I consistently kept two save files, but suddenly one of them disappeared with a lot of hours put into it. I am now fully discouraged from playing, but I guess all gamers go through this,
Would rate 4.5 if it was not for the sudden lost file."
17092,Recommend
17093,"Love this game, super addictive, great mods. Can't wait for a sequel!"
17094,"fun, even better with mods"
17095,"It's a traffic simulator more than anything, but it is fun."
17096,I miss the old kanye
17097,"When the SimCity franchise died in shame, Colossal Order turned the idea of a city builder into a fleshed out product with an engine that does an amazing job simulating the daily lives of your citizens and tourists. It is not a survival game though, so I usually tend to play it at a leisurely pace. When I forget about the game, new content and mechanics are getting constantly added by the developers in DLCs and that makes me pick it up again and start a new map with a smile on my face."
17098,"As an architect, it is very entertaining
"
17099,The game no longer works with MacOS
17100,"Don't ask me how I have 1.6k hours. I have no clue. fun game though if you like sandboxes, strategy games, anything building related, or running cities. also insanely good workshop so you can completely transform the game if there are some things in the base game you don't like"
17101,"Very addicting, I love micromanaging small details so this game is perfect for me."
17102,probably
17103,really good game mods on the workshop work really well and improve the game drastically making it more realistic
17104,"good
"
17105,yes
17106,"I built Gary Indiana
"
17107,"It's the best city builder ever made. It destroys everything else in it's genre.

And with support from the modding community, it's even better.

If you even have a passing interest in city builders, get this one."
17108,simcity but cooler
17109,"Awesome game, unending city building fun, with lots of options for mass transit, dedicated buildings and zones, great DLCs... just plain fun!"
17110,"I love it. The base game it a little dry, but the add-ons are dirt cheap when on sale, and the free mods are life savers!"
17111,"only thing i don't like is that i have to dump sewage into my pristine ocean because the inland water treatment plant is in a dlc and you unlock the (free) cleaner way of disposing sewage at 13,000 population, by then my ocean was already full of immovable poop."
17112,"If you like city builder games like Sim City then this game is a must, this blows Sim City out of water. its so much more in depth and realistic..
You can progress and buy extra bits of land surrounding your city so it grows and grows, i have also tried a few expansion packs and they too are a great addition.
i highly recommend this game, give it a go"
17113,"Its fair to say this is the best City builder I've come across, adding elements from the workshop really can transform your play-through which is good.

If you liked the old school Sim Cities back in the day then this is the one to get, make sure you add the transport and industries DLC's to get the most out of it."
17114,"Everything you could ever want in a city building game. it was fantastic when it first came out, and it gets better year after year with all the expansions and mod content."
17115,"Even after five years, this game is still the best city builder."
17116,"One of the best strategic game available with lot of capabilities and unlimited possibilities. One should surely try this game if you are a planning person even the laziest minds get intrigued .
Thank You Paradox for such a wonderful game."
17117,"100 bucks to play all available DLC. I can bet my ass this company is already well into the plus side and don't actually need any more money, just licking the ass of the investors and the rest of the capitalistic bullcrap regime. Would reccomend if DLC was available for free (included in base game price) as should be expected by any non-m0ron gamers."
17118,"Gelmiş geçmiş en iyi şehir yapma oyunudur. Tavsiye olunur.
                                                                                                   -31"
17119,a really nice game
17120,very imersive and relaxing to play
17121,fok yea
17122,"Cities: Skylines is probably the best city-building simulator around. There's something so cool about watching a city come to live as you build it from scratch. I find it disappointing that so many features are hidden behind tiny DLC packs, but I guess we live in a capitalist world, huh? There are a few bugs here and there (and the GUI is a bit blurry on higher resolutions) but overall you will most definitely sink plenty hours into this game. Remember to stand and take a break every hour (:"
17123,"Played it for a bit, it's ok I guess ;)"
17124,hard but addictive like my dick
17125,Very enjoyable
17126,very relaxing
17127,nice killing time game
17128,yeee
17129,Best city management / builder I've played in a hot minute... maybe ever.
17130,Paradox Launcher will not works one error code after another.
17131,"Amazing game. MORE than worth the purchase price. You'll be playing for years without getting bored of it, especially once you expand to adding mods."
17132,"Over 600 hours, for sure the game i've spent most time playing... Get the DLC's when they're on discount!"
17133,a
17134,Good if you like city building/sim games. Otherwise okay.
17135,A build and build and build city simulator with all of the bells and whistles.
17136,great game
17137,very good
17138,Sims City 5
17139,"Change the name of this game to ""Crack: Addiction"""
17140,its good
17141,"More and more I am growing to just resent the Paradox business model. They seem to be using the same strategy for everything, by which I mean release the game itself with only bare bones features with the full experience locked behind 200+ dollars worth of DLCs that really should have just been included in the base game. 
As far as the game itself goes... It's OK... It's much better with all the DLCs at which point it starts to feel like a ""full game"".
But the base game will get old after a few hours.
Honestly not worth it."
17142,good
17143,great city builder vanilla and with mods
17144,Good.
17145,"I loved Sim City, and this game is even better.  You have to try this !!!"
17146,"Used to love this game and probably still would if I could actually get it to run.  Now I have to create a Paradox account, link it to my Steam, agree to, I lost count of how many end user licence agreements,.. only to have it not run.  I can't get it to run after all that.  I'll try something else later but for now this just needed to be said.  They've ruined it"
17147,Excellent city simulation game

17151,"I love how much there is to do in this game. I'm still learning how things work, and just getting into the challenges after 200 hours in the game."
17152,sick
17153,tis good
17154,ye
17155,Latest update has broken my game.
17156,I wanna poo brb
17157,good
17158,"i flooded the city in shit


what else do i have to say?"
17159,great
17160,I like everything about Cities: Skylines!  This game is captivating
17161,Please make me stop playing.
17162,The type of game that I spend 5 hours playing before I realize that I forgot to eat dinner. There are so many mods that you can use to customize your city exactly how you want to (and they're easy to install). It's insanely satisfying to watch your city grow and solve problems as they arise
17163,"its aight 
"
17164,Love this Game its Really Fun But Can Be Hard to get a good City Started  Give this Game a Try its Really Good
17165,why does it say i can write a review i dont even play or have the game on this account
17166,"great to pass time,"
17167,Masterpiece.
17168,"its a very fun but a hard making money game with a challenge to get as much people in your city, *hashtag# fun*"
17169,I love this game like real life minecraft.
17170,"good
"
17171,"One of those games where the steam workshop is a must and it's possibly my favourite game on steam because of it. Best city builder out there.

Need something better than a laptop if you want to use a lot of mods"
17172,"Cities: Skylines is a very immersive city simulator with a wealth of customization features rarely found in competitors like SimCity. On top of that, Paradox's embracing of the Steam Workshop vastly extends the functionality and depth of the game in new and meaningful ways."
17173,"its just fun...
"
17174,Its crazy addictive for no reason whatsoever and I can't quite put my finger on it
17175,Build it!!!
17176,It is all a fun game until traffic jam kicks in!
17177,I love it!
17178,I love the graphics.  Great way to pass the time.
17179,good game but lags when you have too many mods and assets
17180,DLCs are very expensive for what u get out of them but the game is fun
17181,Even with all the DLC it is still totaly worth it. With almost a thousand hours in this game my per hour cost is low.
17182,"Really chill and slow game. Need a bit of smart planning and get-to-know the basics mechanisms of businesses and factory but nothing to crazy, really easy to manage and figure out"
17183,Vary creative and funer with the Disaster DLC.
17184,"I have it but I don't play it because I lack Urban Planning skills. 
10/10"
17185,"Your cure to simcity simulation game.
Superb gameplay, interesting mechanic and stunning visual.

Got broke so fast, so many pollution, traffic jam everywhere. am i that bad? Is this game broken? Find out yourself..."
17186,"Ah well what can I say... It's cities skylines! After you get a vanilla city running, you'llplunge into the rabbit hole of all the mods that are available. Incredible stuff, and you'll wonder what the hell happened to all your free time."
17187,"I really enjoy the game and how it works. It is a great resource for city design, and I am glad for the purchase. One problem I have is that severe floods are almost impossible to get rid of without buying the DLC."
17188,cx
17189,Great game......old now but still a goody!
17190,The game is enjoyable for the most part. It's easy to play. It's a good alternative to other city building simulation games. I recommend it if you like games like this.
17191,Its a fun time killler!
17192,"Thoroughly recommended. By far and away the best City building and planning game I have ever played. I used to play on console but made the switch to PC not long ago. Thoroughly satisfying start game. Restructuring and engineering is what took me a little while to understand and appreciate but discovering the game has more of a purpose than just enlarging the population to buy all the land has easily tripled my play time. I enjoy the sandbox element, there is so much fun to be had even just watching your citizens go about their daily lives. Renaming roads and buildings is a good addition. Plenty of expansions to get your teeth into although the DLC is slightly pricey in my opinion."
17193,cities skylines deez nuts
17194,"I think Cities: Skylines is probably the best example of a city building simulator. The freedom you can get in this game is absolutely amazing. You can go into details, manage your cities needs, create amazing transport systems, mod the hell out of the game. I'm confidently recommend this game to everybody, who likes these types of games."
17195,"Still my favorite game! You'll find yourself buying new computer hardware just to run it, especially if you let yourself go haywire on the mods and user-created assets. But, it is the most worthy successor out there to the Simcity franchise I grew up on, and a lot of its strengths and flaws are shared ones. It does have the weird start-a-city-in-an-utterly-empty-field-and-rule-it-as-a-dictator conceit as its forebears, and the urban dynamics employed as the model for its simulation are highly questionable. But, once you've ""beat"" the game once or twice, building massive vanilla cities, there's no huge reason TO play by those rules, with a thousand mods available to break up the unreality of some features and maybe introduce others. These days, I always play with money and progression ""cheats"", and build the cities I aesthetically desire to see in the world. I'll spend months building idealized urban environments with complex stories and finely detailed neighborhoods. And I enjoy every minute of it. My daily job in real life is a stressful one, and Skylines offers an alternative reality where it feels like my tendency for obsessive overwork can result in something beautiful and satisfying at the end of the day, rather than dissipating into the void."
17196,Really make my brain work harder than before. Time well spent
17197,"A great city simulation game.
The mod support allows you to build the city of your dreams, otherwise the game on its own gets a bit repetitive. For the most part, the game is quite easy if you know what you're doing. Even with the disasters DLC, it can be easy.

All of that said, its addictive, fun, and its potential is limited to the amount of time you'd like to spend browsing the Steam Workshop for awesome mods, assets and other cool items."
17198,Hi
17199,good game expensive but if you have the money and like city games i reccomend it.
17200,"Such a fun game! Played for almost 7 hours straight when i first bought it. When you get a little further problems occur, especially traffic but it makes the game more challenging and fun!"
17201,what the original simcity series should have become 10/10
17202,"The best city sim hands down. Mods and the community are very nice additions to it. Highly recommend if you like city builders.

Traffic management mods are NECESSARY."
17203,"wow
"
17204,good game
17205,Slightly better than a mouthful of nails
17206,"Early game you will be playing a city building simulator.
Mid game you will be playing a traffic manager simulator.
Late game you will be playing a city painting simulator.

9.1/10 it has a little something for everyone"
17207,"Not a game that I can binge for long periods of time every day. Great game nonetheless. Playing it for a couple hours here and there make it a fun and interesting game to play, designing your own city and competing against yourself in this challenging simulator. Don't forget to keep your cities water intake upstream and the sewage downstream or you're going to have some problems..."
17208,;)
17209,Awesome.  The game definitely needs some of the DLC to greatly enhance it.  Very relaxing but challenging enough to keep the micro management focus.
17210,Game is in desperate need of optimisation or maybe adapt mods into future game
17211,"The level of control you have over your city is astonishing. Your imagination is the only thing stopping you from building the city of your dreams. Cities: Skylines also has a lot of great mods and additions. You might find it a little confusing if you came from SimCity like I did, but the time to figure it out is worth it. A great game!"
17212,"Very nice game with a lot of realism. I however find it nearly essential to start the game with a couple mods and DLCs which tend to be really nice additions. I guess, if you like city planning, go for it !"
17213,build city
17214,"Excellent game play at a good pace, plus all the mods and DLC's make this a really engaging and fun sim!"
17215,fun lol
17216,"its not htat good it could be better, game cities yes"
17217,"Had a plauge run rampant throughout my town and happiness fell by 2%, 10/10 worth the power trip"
17218,Best City Simulator since Simcity 4.  (Sorry Maxis)
17219,This game is by far one of the best on STEAM it made me want to ba an city planner.
17220,Fun to play

17239,Kerajaan Gagal Simulator
17240,a great game
17241,I hate bus lines
17242,"There's always something to do in this game and you won't finish one map, even for months. Think you've created a perfect neighborhood?

SIKE! Traffic!

Think you've fixed with a roundabout?

SIKE! Traffic!

Let me build this bridge over here.

SIKE! Traffic!

Gets your brain working most of the time and a great game to alt-tab when you are doing multiple things at one time"
17243,"nice game but needs more grafics
"
17244,"It's a good game, but they shouldn't be rewarded for intentionally turning the most popular mods into DLC that break the original freely available mods just so you have to get the DLC. Particularly when most of the mods available are better quality than anything in the DLC."
17245,great game im addicted
17246,good game
17247,i should probably stop violently swearing at the fake people but i wont because its funny
17248,"Cities Skylines have lots of interesting, I have to played some times to control and build cities efficiently. There are many things which you have to learn, understand and apply to solve problems of each city like traffic, happiness, education and scale of cities."
17249,This is an engaging game that provides a number of calming challenges. It is great watching your city grow and decline as some planning decisions work and others don't. The effects are cool.. watch out for sewage staining the ocean currents and then polluting your cities water supplies.
17250,fun
17251,building
17252,"I can't believe how detailed everything looks and plays, especially in 4k.  The game is very intricate.  I wish some of the mechanics were better explained.  I also wish there were just a few more basic structures included.  Like a zoo, how do you not have a zoo included with the base game?  But, overall this is a great, modern take on Sim City, which is exactly what I was looking for."
17253,"As good as the game is for single players, its a real shame you cant actually play it with others."
17254,Good game
17255,good
17256,Fecking Amazing
17257,yes
17258,so goood game i like : )
17259,"I just love it, all i gotta say."
17260,Me likey
17261,"Decided it was time to see what all the fuss was about, and holy hell I am not disappointed. Tons of stuff to do, even in just the vanilla version. Dozens of mods lmao, which lead to an insane level of detail and management. I'd say it's a solid 9.5/10"
17262,kinda cool. spent a few hours on it
17263,The best
17264,Have been playing this games since 6-7 years! Gives you joy of building your own city the way you want it to be! Name it what you wish! Huge DLCs and mods available which makes game more interesting.
17265,Great strategy game.
17266,"The best city game ever, requires a good PC"
17267,ya
17268,"Funny lol
"
17269,"it is a good game
"
17270,I have no idea how to sustain my city and for me nothing happens.
17271,city
17272,good
17273,Its a great game if you want to put the time in and learn every little thing
17274,If i had a pc that could handle running the game with like 40 mods and 4000 assets my city would be so pogchamp my dude
17275,"Kind of expensive if you account for DLC (and some of them really are necessary IMO). I've been buying this game piece by piece for several years on sales, so the big price was not so noticeable to me, and it's the only city builder that makes me want to return to it and even consider buying those extensions. 

Probably the main reason why I adore this game is extensibility via Workshop, which can fix pretty much any issue you may have with the base game (it is also pretty good on its own though). In my memory, this is the first, and currently only one of city builders with such vast array of mods. The sheer scope of how much detail you can add to your city is insane, and is basically unmatched - draw your intersection lanes, change road signs, place individual rocks, tons of assets to add to your city allow it to truly be unique.

However, like with other ""build-your-game"" types of cituations there's a collection of bad side-effects and clunkiness that comes with mods interacting with each other. The other day I've spent ~3hrs trying to create a city because some asset that I've subscribed to 5 years ago could not be loaded from workshop or something. This is the price you gotta pay to be able to say to game ""just let me place this building here and shut up"", i guess."
17276,gg
17277,"veri gud gajm, i veri muc enjoy."
17278,The base game is very fun and will entertain you for hours but once you start browsing the steam workshop it really takes the game to another level and can turn into you spending 2 hours detailing a train station
17279,let time pass
17280,very fun 10/10 rec to others
17281,.
17282,"I played this game quite a bit; but for the last several years regardless of how much workshop content I remove; it crashes on every single system I install it on. 

I have tried to introduce it to many people but like eu4 the amount of DLC and difficulty creates a 'this high to ride' barrier of entry. I wish the publishers would change their DLC revenue model as even being invested in the game I am confused weary and tired of the content additions"
17283,Very good for Government Policies Simulation
17284,very hard and i don't know what I'm doing.
17285,Haha Meteor Goes Boom
17286,awesomeness!!!! Download it if you want to know what i mean
17287,"I have no clue what i'm doing and i'm having a blast, this game is awesome!"
17288,"To be truely honest, this game to me, is far superior over Simcity. I have played every Maxis Simcity and this just blows it out of the water as far as the game play goes.

I mean, they have $151 dollars worth of DLC for it, when has Maxis put any DLC for Simcity out? Never. Worth a purchase on this game. A+++"
17289,meh
17290,Cities Skylines goes BRRRRRRRRT.
17291,"Mods make this game perfect, baring the frame rate being atrocious."
17292,"big build city - destroy with boom - repeat
i still do this but make bigger city - with more dlcs"
17293,A lot more to offer than the SimCity Brand!  And larger non-restrictive maps make it a winner.
17294,"fun game if you like city building games, most DLC isnt required but others will completely change the game."
17295,fun.
17296,I spend 40 hours on this game and probably only understand 15% of it.
17297,"Look. You either want to spend hundreds of hours designing highway interchanges and adding lines to exit ramps and reading up on modern urban planning principles, or you don't. 10/10."
17298,Too expensive
17299,Me gusta mucho el juego y es muy dinàmico
17300,city be cool
17301,it good
17302,PLAY IT
17303,makes me feel loved
17304,"Good, becoming classic, game. Endlessly changing mods let it down a little - quite often a save game will completely glitch without clear reason (even though there are mods to help pick through these). 
Very active mod community is both a blessing and a curse. A blessing as almost everything is catered for, a curse as hard drive space gets used up very quickly!
I still recommend, whole-heartedly."
17305,Good game for those who like this genre
17306,"Fantastic game!! I love it! Mods, roads, cars, DLCs, everything! 
I recommend people who have very good computers to have it, it’s a very good game. 👍
But, there’s one problem for not so good computers, Cities Skylines takes for at least 30 or more minutes to load. 

Please tell me some good suggestions for a good computer for Cities Skylines."
17307,very nice game
17308,70 hours in 5 days  :/
17309,Just Amazing!
17310,Good
17311,"Quite a good game! theres a variety of DLC and things to do in-game but I'd give it a 9/10 because I occasionally have lag in certain places ,I'm not sure if thats a glitch? I'd highly recommend this game and the DLC if you are the person that likes building in games!"
17312,"fun game complicated at first but once you understand how electrcity and water works the game is very fun
"
17313,"Very fun game
"
17314,THE BEST GAME EVER!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
17315,its chill and all but you just build american suburbs
17316,addicted
17317,very good game
17318,Best City Builder simulator ever.
17319,I've never even thought of playing another city-builder after getting this game. Enough said.
17320,never played it
17321,Endless playing.
17322,building is fun
17323,"great city manager and not to complex if you dont make it complex, great game overall
"
17324,Cool concept
17325,Why is it so easy to make India.

17332,great game for a great price. I highly recommend.
17333,is good
17334,"traffic worse than a line for dream at vidcon

but i just suck at roads"
17335,"I love this game.

I love it even more after Steam asked me to leave a review at 69 Hours..

All I gotta say is NICE!"
17336,"Very fun, like old school sim city but still fun! unlike new sim city"
17337,good
17338,Adding in mods and DLCs is a must. awesome game that takes city building to the next level!
17339,I would recommend this game. great product
17340,It's a relaxing game that requires a lot of strategy and cognitive flexibility. It is a great a way to spend some free time and/or to unwind from a long day.
17341,There is no game I recommend more than Cities: Skylines.
17342,
17343,This is a really good game. Best city builder game I've ever played. I used to watch youtubers playing it. 
17344,fun
17345,i love this game
17346,"burning,flooding,bombing your city never gets old"
17347,"The game is good, but customer support is awful.

I am unable to login to my paradox account (it says my password is wrong, no matter how many times I reset it). I tried contacting them through email, but apparently they didn't care enough to help because they told me to open a ticket, which I need to login to do."
17348,Great game but you need at least some dlc
17349,There was an attempt
17350,"100% recommended, specially with mods.
"
17351,Amazing City building game.  Love it!
17352,\m/
17353,i liked everything but harder since im used to xbox
17354,It's Alright
17355,"Still the best straight up city builder around, plenty of mods to tweak the game how you like it."
17356,Great game!
17357,"I only have a few hours on the game as of now but even after only 8 hours of gameplay I totally recommend this game to everyone. Not only is the gameplay top notch but the entire experience of the game is amazing.  Add the DLC and the modding that just pushes the game even further on the spectrum of being one of the number 1 city builders around. 

I also really appreciate the realism the game provides with the economy, city management, Resource management, and the RICO manaagement systems. Sim City use to be the number one game on the market but ever since this game was released there are no others in this genre that can beat it out right now. 

If you love City Builder games as much as I do then this game has to be the next addition to your catalog.  Once I added this game to my catalog I instantly bought all of the DLC thats available also. 

Just do it cause you dont kbow what your missing if you javent tried this game yet"
17358,The game was good but may be confusing at times
17359,"I have enjoyed the genre of city building for a long time. I've experienced SimCity, Banished, and so many others. Cities: Skylines offers much more with the addition of the workshop. You can plan your city in whatever fashion you wish whether it's industry, tourism or even a mega-plex of life. I've been playing since the game first installed and have added the DLCs that added more content to the game.     
Each time I play I learn acquire a new understanding of our civil engineers decide to build communities with street design and traffic control. The game is definitely worth it. And always looking out for more options to play."
17360,maybe
17361,Layin pipe since '94
17362,"immersive ... Nothing in life is perfect, but this is close."
17363,"great game. i play this with my cat and trying to not get people killed. 

and i bought this game 1 hour it went 75 % off r.i.p 60 bucks of a game and dlc could get the whole game for the same price of the game and 3 dlc.

best game ever 10/10"
17364,it is good fun - can recommend it
17365,This is the only successor to old Sim City games out there.
17366,Takes some time to get into but when you understand the mechanics you open up so much more to do in a city. I have great fun making both European cities without any sense of road planning as well as more American cities of huge grids.
17367,This game is for the causal player that like to chill with a hot cuppa coffee with no distractions!
17368,Traffic management simulator 3000
17369,Best Modern City Builder. What else?
17370,I like to eat ass
17371,Very satisfying game once you get into the mechanics. Loads and loads to explore.  A++++++++
17372,"Build your city simulator. 

Endless possibilities."
17373,"Better then Sim Town 4, that's for sure."
17374,Worse than being gassed
17375,neat
17376,Fun and a good way to de-stress after a long work day
17377,"Absolutely infuriating game. NOT the kind of game you can just relax and enjoy, which is odd since this game should fit right into that category, given its theme.

Right off the bat, you'll have a problem: Your first task (can't do anything else) is to build a road. They give you [i]one[/i] road, and it's the wrong type. You are expected to connect it to two one-way 3-lane highway streets (you know, the kind you can't actually build in this game?). Pretty much no choice but to connect them together with the little 2-way 2-lane road you were given and connect a road to each side of it so that at least your newly placed road can look and function like a proper road in some regard, minus the fact the way to/from the highway has 3 lanes and each one-way, all stopping at your little road at once. These highway roads are also close to each other, which will haunt your traffic later.

The second thing you must do (trial and error will let you know this) is find a body of water, which on all 4 maps I've seen so far, are all placed at the literal opposite end of your map. This means once you place it, you need to build both power lines and a water pipe [b]all[/b] the way to the roads you laid, since that is where you will be allowed to place houses and such, and they'll immediately need water and electricity.

You'll quickly see a garbage icon on each house. Whoops, now you need a drainage pipe to clean the water, which if placed in the wrong place will cause the same problem it's designed to fix. Then you have the power plant, which causes high pollution. That needs those power lines to connect (more or less) to the plant so all those lines have power. Not too long after you place these things, you'll be down to like $5k and you'll be losing money very fast. This leads us to the budget. Minimize both the power and water budget. With nearly no buildings yet you won't have need to fund these places yet.

Then you paint areas a color that represents what you want to build. Green = Housing, Blue = Commerce, and Yellow = Industry. Demand for housing is at max by default, so build houses. Like lots of houses. This is when the game breaks.

You will very quickly need to adjust your budget since now there are a lot of buildings draining power/water. You will also be losing money rapidly so you better have your roads, power lines and water pipes sorted for now. You won't be able to afford to build more soon.

At this point your only option is to slowly (quickly...) go into debt and watch the population grow. You'll need a certain number of people living there to get your first milestone, which offers more options (problems) and a completely necessary $20k bonus. Get ready to watch that vanish in vain.

Next comes the ever hated and comically broken Garbage system. If you find that you want to refund this game, the garbage trucks will probably be why. Right off the bat everyone's garbage will pile up. You gotta build a landfill, which gives 2 garbage trucks each and costs $4k. It also causes Stank which looms in a large area around the landfill. This means you don't want to place houses anywhere near it. Sounds simple until you see the demand for housing go through the roof.

Now you have crime, fires and sick people. Everyone expects you to build a fire station, police station, a clinic, and of course power lines and water pipes. Once you've placed your landfill, a definite [b]first[/b] priority, you'll be okay for a short period of time, until you start losing money again (you are almost always losing money). Time to adjust budgets. Click the electric or water options as if you were gonna place lines and the amount of availability of both will be shown. If you have my luck, people will not have electricity, so you need to carefully adjust the power budget to reach minimal acceptability. Any extra will always cost you dearly. Speaking of extra power...

Wind turbines. Do not, I repeat, do NOT ever use these. Oh sure, people will love the ""green energy"", but remember what a wind turbines uses to generate power. You will now be reliant on wind to power homes, which fluctuates greatly all the time. When the wind picks up, you suddenly get a monstrous amount of electricity. Sounds great, right? HELL NO it's not. It's not like real life when these turbines generate power and now you have power charged up real good for everyone and the turbine pays for itself. No, the moment you get all that added electricity, you suddenly [i]lose[/i] money. The game acts like you have your budget set way too high, which is programmed to then charge you money for being wasteful. This means you must check electricity availability at all times and babysit it hard. Fail to adjust in time and your money is as good as gone.

That garbage though... here is where I get PTSD. You have a landfill right... you have houses outside of its Stank range and roads will lead right from the landfill to the houses. Well, be ready to watch garbage trucks pass right by them with their middle fingers up, cuz that garbage isn't going anywhere. No doubt you adjusted the budget for garbage as soon as you built the landfill, and now that too will wildly fluctuate. In the game I recently abandoned out of hopelessness, I had [i]eight[/i] landfills in a single-area map, pretty much surrounding the map with loads and loads of houses, all demanding garbage pick up. I had the garbage budget set to 110% and it was costing me more than my whole city's electric, yet people kept abandoning homes from dereliction of duty from the overpaid lazy scrub garbage men.

Remember, you only make money when all needs are met, and those require very expensive buildings and constant budget management. This makes it extremely easy to go into debt, and in this game, debt can't be reversed if people demand another building you badly need and you have nowhere near enough money to buy it. If you don't buy it, you will keep losing money, so you now have a problem that can't be solved. There's even a Bailout option for when you inevitably go into debt, that gives $50k, but turns off achievements and milestones, so no more building types will ever be unlocked. Trust me, you'll need those new types of buildings badly.

So, the game has a high chance of a checkmate on your city. It's very easy to lose too much money from things beyond your control and have no way out, especially the garbage trucks ignoring their jobs even when they're being paid like doctors."
17378,great way to see what it takes to build a strong and flowing city
17379,Great game if you like creating cities
17380,I like the total control you have over the city.
17381,"What to say about this good game... I made the most realistic city with the most realistic ghetto you can think of! 
The only water supply is poo water from the drains of the sewage companies within the richer parts of the city.
The people there should be glad cause they get to drink rich poo water."
17382,"Hell yeah its good, im the fucking governor here"
17383,"Well well well. Cities Skylines, this game is probably the most immersive game I have ever played, the best way to put it is the possibilities are endless, If you like building this game is 130% for you, +30% for good measure.
| Reccomended |"
17384,Keeps god damn crashing!
17385,WOW NO SO GOOD AS I 1ST THOUGHT EVERYONE GETS SICK THEN IT GOES SOUTH RAPIDLY NO MATTER WHAT YOU DO
17386,gud
17387,"If you like management type games along with building/customizing, this one's for you. There are certain things I would change about this game, probably my biggest complaint with it is the fact that it runs slow when your population gets higher (>100,000 for me). This probably depends greatly on your system, but mine well exceeds recommended specifications. Don't let this scare you away, though. It takes quite a while to build up to that population and by the time you do, you've unlocked everything already anyway. There are all kinds of things you can do in this game to put your imagination to work. Try it out, it's worth it. The DLC also adds cool features, features that I find to be worth the money. 206 hours and counting, still one of my favorite games and it never gets old."
17388,"I have wasted wayyy too much time in this game. You can do really anything and everything with mods, and traffic late game is super challenging."
17389,cities skylines >>>> simcity
17390,yes
17391,"i just spammed roads and now my cars disappear after every intersection

but if it works it works"
17392,good stuff
17393,Great game    fun way to pass some time.   Stimulating.
17394,"fuck yeah, CONCRETE!!"
17395,"Games the best, I'm bout to do this on a touch screen, gonna be tight."
17396,nice fun game
17397,Great game
17398,"At launch this game was praised for being better and more functional than SimCity. 
Now it is so needlessly complicated with more micromanagement than it needs and so full of DLCs it's looking like a game made by EA. Sure, a few DLCs are fine, we're not in the 90s anymore, but 30?!"
17399,"Very good game. The core game without any DLCs is very cool, but the DLCs add more core and more stuff to your city to make it what you want. But if your a guy who likes to build citys. Pick this game."
17400,Absolutely awesome game. Totally recommend. Though it would be cool to have a War Add-on pls.
17401,I like it
17402,Didn't think it would be this fun
17403,"Wonderful game. Easy to learn, easy to let the creative side out in this game."
17404,10/10
17405,65EEEEEEEEEEEEEM
17406,The ultimate city builder game!
17407,"I've sunk over 1,000 hours into Cities. No regrets. Cities is one of the best games out there in regards to development & community relationship. The game itself is great, the DLCs are worth it (aside from the radio ones), and the workshop is absolutely insane. The modding community for this game is top notch. If someone makes something neat & loses interest or just doesn't have the time, someone else will come along to keep that beloved mod alive. Same for assets too. Literally one of the BEST communities around. Truly mean that. This game can be whatever you want it to be, casual chill times, crazy challenges, detail oriented or just top level management & building. The possibilities are pretty much endless."
17408,Nice game.
17409,"buidlimgs

17410,Game = Good
17411,This is one of my favorite games it requires so much thinking and planning and readjusting I LOVE IT
17412,love the game. Only hassle is fixing the game to get it to start right before I can start playing. Once it starts so much time has gone that I stop playing.
17413,Great if you like attention to detail.  Any faults have been addressed by modders in the steam workshop.
17414,absolutely amazing city building game
17415,it's ok I guess
17416,Best Game Ever.
17417,"approachable, fun even without mods, but the community stuff makes the game :)"
17418,"good for modding

17419,dlc's are very good addition to the very good base game 10/10
17420,"Never knew a offline game can be so relaxing, so If you like building cities this game is damn well for you... 
Been playing this game for over three years and I never got bored somehow."
17421,"Heres the thing about Cities Skylines: It's an awesome game but SUPER hard to learn. I mean SUPPPPEERRR hard to learn! It took my over a year to learn this game and I still don't know the game very well! It's so fun though and I think that you will enjoy the game. Please reply to me if this comment helped you.

17422,Well rounded single player game. This really isnt any limits when it comes to building a city especially when you began to play with mods. Can easily spend hours on this.
17423,Dynamically fun city builder

17425,"OVERVIEW
Cities Skylines is one of my favorite games of all time. The depth in which the game delivers makes it feel as if you're actually designing a city in the real world. The game is somewhat complex to start off, however once you learn how to play, everything is second nature. I have designed many cities, and each time, I will end up learning how to manage something a bit better whether that is traffic flow or something else. Sometimes, you can tell the traffic isn't as accurate as it could be, but for the most part it's pretty good. This is one of the only things I can think of that I personally don't like about the game (although this can easily be fixed with a mod). I never find myself becoming bored/burnt out by the game and can spend hours at one time working on one city (assuming I have the time to).

MODS/ASSETS
One of the main reasons I still am playing this game is because of the massive library of mods and custom assets. This allows for even more diverse cities to be created within this game. I use hundreds of custom assets and dozens of mods to make my cities more customized to my liking. The only down side to using a large amount of custom assets/mods is you need a fast PC to run them all. Although if you have a decent PC, you can add a lot of content without spending money on DLC (although you cannot add extra gameplay this way just adds assets and mods).

DLC
I have almost every DLC pack and can say I do not regret any of them. The only one I would not recommend as much is sunset harbor. To me it doesn't add as much as it could've for what you pay for but it still isn't bad. By far, my personal favorite DLC pack is mass transit. I enjoy fixing traffic on roads and enjoy making it easier for citizens to get around my cities in other various ways. Mass transit expands that gameplay even further than already given in the base game.  The other notable packs I have enjoyed the most are green cities and the campus pack but every other DLC pack are still worth getting in my opinion.

Overall, great game - best city builder of all time in my opinion."
17426,Best City Builder/Simulator around.
17427,"""And i started out on a Small Loan of a Million Dollars""
"
17428,This game is good
17429,It is what Maxis should have created after SimCity 4.  Paradox did a great job.  Just test mods individually as you added them.  Adding too many at one go ends in crashing grief.
17430,I grew up loving the SimCity franchise. Cities: Skylines takes the city simulator to a new level. I love the large assets and mods collections that are available to tweak and model my cities to make them run and look just right. I highly recommend giving it a try.
17431,"really fun and well made, my only complaint is that not everything seems realistic like the fact that people will drive halfway across the map just for food or to go to a store but otherwise its really well made imo and there are several mods you can use that help make the experience even more immersive

note: i downloaded this game during a free trial event but then bought it a few days later bc i liked it so much which is why i didnt check the purchased for free box"

17450,"As someone who rarely plays strategy simulation games, I was a bit sceptical when I was recommended this game. To my surprise I thoroughly enjoyed it. This game allows you to build beautiful cities complete with commercial, residential and industrial sectors, complex road networks, a variety of public transport systems and a hell of a lot more. The city management systems give the game an extra challenge to keep your cities operating and with an abundance of fun new DLC and a very active and creative modding community really makes this game great. Hope others enjoy this game as much as I have."
17451,"This is a fun game that I started to play two years ago on my PlayStation4 for a free trial. After buying several DLCs, I decided I wanted the PC version. The whole household loved to play this game."
17452,"excellent city builder with lots of interesting complicated features, some things like ai isn't stellar but workshop mods make it much more fun"
17453,"I used to be an avid SimCity player, that was until they jacked it all up with 4. I discovered CS, and it is everything I could ever want in my ideal city building simulation. Bravo! to the developers, and all the wonderful people on Steam who make workshop content."
17454,"I came across this game after looking for a game like SimCity, when I found this game, it took me awhile to actually buy it. Ever since then, I have been hooked on this amazing game! I have bought a few DLC's (they make the experience Much better) and even though I still am very bad at the game, I will always have this game as one of my favorites. If you are looking to buy it, don't waste time contemplating! Buy it! Its the best city-building game ever made! Thank you to the developers and the amazing community behind it! Until we meet again in the streets of my city! Enjoy the game!"
17455,good
17456,"very realistic game, i reccomend it
its way better if you have mods installed"

17467,good
17468,I switched devices and my city got deleted.
17469,Very intricate building/sim game with a wide variety of building to chose from and upgrades for those buildings. I loved the amount of creativity I had while playing this game with being able to add a zoo to building the largest public transportation system in the world. Overall I enjoyed this game and if you like a building/sim game about controlling your own city then this game is for you.

17478,good build lot good
17479,"The game trumps Sim City in every way as it is way better maintained and not completely DLC overloaded, which however seems to become a problem more and more. I would welcome a Special (Deluxe) edition where I do not have to sell my soul for all the DLCs.

Only problem which I encountered is the sound stuttering that seems to be a problem that exists since the initial release.
The forums (Steam and creator) have many threads about it, but no solution has been provided by the creator.
I recommend disabling the ingame-music and starting a Youtube-Playlist, with SimCity music. :P"
17480,fun game!
17481,super easy to mod and yes
17482,"I like it. I also wrote this for the Steam community badge. Sorry for wasting your time, but this game won't."

17486,it's fun to play for me
17487,Great for entertaining your OCD
17488,recommend just note that many great features only come with mods so plan on adding them to your game
17489,Great game

17499,i lost my kids to this game to addicting if you have a life
17500,Like it better than SimCity
17501,This game is very relaxing but also challenging.
17502,the best simcity game so far.
17503,hey i absolutely love your game and uh my game is crashing every single time its half way loading my first city. can you fix that bug of game crashing please?
17504,"I didn't expect to like this game so much, I simply got it to see what it was"
17505,"pretty fun 
"
17506,Best City Builder available. Very in-depth.
17507,Standard Paradox game that leaves all the essential features locked behind hundreds of dollars worth of DLC. There are better city builders with better sales models. I will however admit that it is graphically a beautiful game.

17519,"if you like games that require dedication and somewhat strategic thoughts, then this is the game for you. loads of different variables can affect all sorts of things at once, the graphics are beautiful, and the workshop allows endless mods and models to be added"
17520,Best city builder out there.
17521,"its  cool
"
17522,"nigger rob a store
"
17523,"this simulation is so realistic - just like in real life noone knows how to fucking change lines which leads to a massive traffic jam tanking your flow down to 30% because they REALLYY need to stay on that forward line, despite the fact they'd get quicker to their destination by changing the lane, and when they finally do, they just go back to the same line stopping other cars causing another jam because fuck you lmao. 80% of your playtime is just gonna be building 3-way or 4-way intersections and managing traffic, watch a guide on that before trying this game. traffic is the MOST important aspect, and once you figure it out and create a well functioning traffic system its super satisfying to watch a traffic jam problem resolve itself"
17524,"Very engaging game.  I love finding a mature game I really enjoy a few years after release at which point the modding community has pretty much thought of everything one could hope for or need.  Makes the completeness real and satisfying.  After watching a few videos I was able to build a gorgeous city and maintain 85% traffic right up to 50K population, with five star industries and parks.  I'm very happy with it.  I can take pretty screenshots and ride around in first-person camera and enjoy my city from so many view points from cars to trains, planes, cable cars and even a hot air balloon.  And Steam gives me the ability to stream to my laptop or link to the big TV to enjoy the game so many different ways.  Cities Skylines on Steam pretty much rules!"
17525,really addicting game that is a perfect creative outlet
17526,nice

17530,"After more than 100h, stoped saving games, i have turned of all my mods, uninstalled and re-installed, problem has not been fixed and a quick look on internet confirms that i am not the only one, time to move on to another game that has a saving system that works better than 1990 games."
17531,"This game looks fun to play but when you actually start to play it, it turns out that most of your playtime will be loading. I got really tired of random crashes and lag. and if i wanted to go back to the menu it took me forever."
17532,"Death by DLC.  This game is great, but the problem is, leaving for a while and coming back is discouraging.  Watching people play the game online, you see them loading up a bunch of DLCs, mods, etc, and connecting with their experience becomes impossible.  If you keep up with the DLCs you care about, its manageable, but it's hard to pop back in after putting it down for a year."
17533,"Wait there's a pandemic going on?

17547,Fun
17548,"this game makes me feel like an idiot more than i already do
"
17549,Yes.
17550,"This is a good game in this genre. There are a lot of rules/guides and I found that any progress is a case of experience, i.e. unless you are an expert, I think you will need a few re-starts to get to the point of developing a city without breaking the bank. Do not be disheartened at the first few attempts which may go awry. Follow the steps as guided and be prepared to rethink some of your first ideas. It's a long game once you get going and rewarding in the end."
17551,game is cool for people who have an interest in games like this (like me) would recommend getting it and dlcs as well to get the best playing experience
17552,good

17555,This game is great!
17556,"Nothing entertains me like building cities. I've played every city building game from the beginning dreaming of a game like Cities:Skyline. Its the best so far. Its not perfect yet. More buildings! Time travel! Reproduction of actual cities! Take a picture, make a building for the game! Bigger maps with more room for more lifelike cities! Then I will walk the streets of my perfect city with virtual reality! I will talk to the folks walking around and doing their thing! And I will stay and live there forever and ever or until I destroy it with a natural disaster, or call down aliens to deal with them."
17557,Great game

17560,"It's fun and addictive, definetly worth the pricetag"
17561,Takes everything good about Sim City to 11 and adds even more control. With Mods it is about the most perfect city builder game I've ever played.
17562,Just get it!
17563,"I like the game in general, but everytime I start a new town I get frustrated with the bugs of one way or another. LIke this build, Getting up to 50k people and even though I have several garbage disposal facilties on my city, and the budget is 150% night & day, the trucks still aren´t spawning. Stuff like that every time."
17564,"Cities: Skylines is the response to the hype that devout Simcity fans had before the disappointment upon the release of Simcity 5. It is almost flawless in terms of city-building; major problems and inconveniences in the game were quickly addressed by the developers, and a massive and active community helped to improve the building experience voluntarily by sharing mods and assets. Upon writing this review, I myself have already played this game for almost 2000 hours now. I am therefore writing to assure you that this game deserves to be given 2000 hours of game time. The photos you see at the store page are just the very beginnings; in time, you can build realistic cities with real-life assets completely free of restrictions. As long as your computer can handle it, don't hesitate. Buy it now and join one of the most active communities ever in letting your imagination run loose."
17565,Will reccomend
17566,good game just needs multiplayer
17567,Good game
17568,i have yet to build a successful city
17569,Very fun If you like sandbox games. Really hard and you need  to think through almost everything. From the beginning to the end it will never get boring if you have a big city.
17570,"I don't have words for how much I enjoy this City Builder Modern Classic. I consider it a Seminal Game in any collection - particularly my own. 

By far above its peers in playability, game-play depth, and Community support. The modding scene alone is worth the price of admission hand over fist. Cities: Skylines players I hold to be some of Planet Earth's most creative and imaginative, intelligent and passionate fan base!"
17571,TOTALLY WORTH THE PRICE.

17578,Nice game :}
17579,.
17580,"Absolutely amazing sandbox game. Could play it all day and get lost in building my cities.
That said, it's not a game for you if you don't think you'll enjoy the traffic management aspect, because that's definitely a big part.
Certain mods are pretty much required for proper gameplay once you really get into it and build bigger cities, but they're all well supported through the Workshop.
The DLC are pretty nice and some of them really add a lot, but they're not needed for having fun at all."
17581,"Easy to play, hard to master. My cities always look like crap, unfortunately i dont have the design talent that many has in me, Some people make the most beautiful cities, and i just envy them.

This game is THE best city builder. Not even Sim City comes close to it. 

The best city builder on the market. GJ developers. Well deserved."
17582,"I like this game
"
17583,"get yourself some mods, they make the game ten times better, though you can always disable them for the pure unmodded experience.
10/10, would break reality with one road again"
17584,very relaxing. until somehow your water supply is tainted and the city you spent hours on becomes a mass grave
17585,ee
17586,"I vividly remember my young self getting addicted to this long-defunct game named CityVille, and now, my adult self is starting to get addicted to Cities: Skylines. The graphics are superb, the gameplay is quite easy to learn, and most importantly, it's extremely fun to play. It's definitely one of those games that you'll find yourself get so immersed in that you'll forget what time it is. Whether you want to make a bustling city and make your citizens happy, or making a volcano filled with sewage and letting it erupt to your poor and innocent citizens, this game has got you covered."
17587,"No matter what, I keep coming back to this game. Sure, there are times where I need to take a break from it, as I've built all I can, but I'll come back, start a new map, check out the new mods, and lose myself into an imaginary metropolis to start the process all over again."

17596,"very good, very nice"
17597,"This game no longer works for me at all. It used to, but now even when I disable all of my subscribed assets/mods and select vanilla maps/themes, it crashes to desktop at the very end of the loading screen - completely wasting my time after what was already a grueling loading screen time. As this game is, as such, unplayable for me, I have no choice but to give it a thumbs down considering I can no longer even experience the game at all. I am uninstalling it after this review. It does nothing for me but take up space."
17598,in someways better then sim city but its what sim city could have been that makes this game the best
17599,"It has provided me literally years of entertainment.  It is never the same game.  It makes you think unlike the almost all first-person-shooters (don't get me wrong I love those too), at 53 this game keeps my mind young and viral."
17600,"-bad pricing policy, buy the game for 10 bucks and another 200 for the dlcs.
-no optimization at all
-mods like TM:PE should be a part of the vanilla game

17603,This game is so addicting and the option to download user made mods and assets makes the game ever changing and improving.

City skylines is much harder than simcity but a the same time, that just makes it more fun,  You can make bigger cities, more things to do, more problems to solve, and an amazing modding community.(just be aware that this game requires a beefy computer to run well so you should probably get a gaming laptop/PC if you want to play this"

There was so much to do and so much you can do, when I booted up the game I was instantly sucked into the awesomeness of the game almost spent a full day on my computer. One thing I don't like is the fact you need the dlcs to play the game correctly and they are really expensive. Overall really fun game and I would recommend getting!"

17643,"THIS is the game that newer SimCity games should have been. It's what we all dreamed the future would look like if you grew up playing SimCity 2000 and SimCity 4.

Before you know it, 6 hours have passed, your family have sent out missing posters and you have missed that thing you said and maybe even wanted to do.

17651,I like the game 10/10
17652,Played this game for 6 hours and already love it! It is a nice and fun city builder that has some questionable vehicle ai but otherwise it is good. Its fun to just watch the cars move and let your city operate. I would recommend just beware a lot of content is locked behind a paywall!!
17653,"Spends 15 hours designing bus route, one could say this is a good game."
17654,It can definitely be a fun game for those who want to chill one night and us there imagination on any level. The community is there if you need it. The game is cheap which makes buying the dlc's not too bad but I do wish the default game music was better.
17655,It is an amazing game. I love all of it. I really like all of the mods you can get for it
17656,"[Based on base game, no DLCs]
This is amazing city builder ""simulator"", but there is very little game here. Only progression is unlocking new buildings based on number of people living in the city.

If you like planning cities, zones, handling traffic etc it can be game for you. For me, there is too much stuff to micro manage and not enough incentive to grow my cities."
17657,fun game but way too much dlc
17658,pretty fun
17659,"This game is really awesome, tons of DLCs and best physics!!!"
17660,Harmony 2.0.4-4 (Mod Dependency)
17661,Its great but dont forget about other city builders too
17662,Amazing!!!
17663,The game fun but the dlc’s are too expensive
17664,Awsome.............
17665,"Decent game core, disgusting DLC practice."
17666,If you're playing this game above 20 fps you're not playing this game right
17667,"very good game, even gooder with mods."
17668,Will never look at street layouts and city maps the same after playing this.
17669,thumb up
17670,"I've played over 2000 hours of this game, yet I don't recommend it.

Why? Because it promises in-depth gameplay, hyped by a committed community of talented artists and constantly pumped full of life by talented modders... But the reality is that it is a highly surface level simulation that leaves too many itches unscratched, even with millions of mods.

For instance... 
- The single use zoning aspect of the game essentially locks you into North American style planning, with a CBD and sprawling suburbs. Outside of public services and utilities, you can only place single buildings, or relocate them on a lot, by using mods that slow your game and clutter your menus.
- The property value system means that if you've provided enough services, every residence becomes a gentrified highrise and every commercial building becomes a skyscraper - there are no controls for this.
To control the aesthetics of your city, you need to download GBs of modded assets, and then deselect the assets you don't want and select the ones you do. It's incredibly time consuming and tedious.
- There are unhappiness, policy and tax features that don't really do anything, but could have easily brought deeper complexity to the game.
- The maps begin as blank fields, more akin to suburban parks than any wilderness you'd find, or rural district. Creating wilderness maps is tedious, especially in balancing terrain - rivers are generally lined by cliffs. If you want hills in your city, you have to also be happy with the building graphics failing to adapt.
- Industry and demand is too abstract, with commercial demand being entirely random, so a sim will travel 2 hrs across the map for 'food', instead of to the nearest shop.
- it's incredibly tedious, nigh impossible, to simulate realistic (or even idealistic) looking agriculture,
- There is no need to emulate historic city growth, aesthetically or realistically - no need for fresh water, you start with cars but not trains, trucks but not ports, etc. The game demands you build a modern car-oriented city and you will struggle to implement anything else. The game refuses to let you operate at a human scale - you can easily throw down train lines and free ways, but all of the ways that these concepts impact us as city dwellers is washed away.

I could write a book on all the issues I had with this game...

Mods help the game immensely, but they also slow it down, make it immensely tedious, and make it unstable. They make the game very taxing for PCs, and you will often lag fairly early into your city building experience. They also trying to combat deeply ingrained mechanics, rather than work with them - you can't mod out terrible design.

In my opinion, much like many Total Wars and like the Elder Scrolls series, this is a good 'base' of a game that is severely lacking in thought and depth, and needed longer in development to have its kinks ironed out. I am hoping a sequel to this game would have significantly deeper mechanics that offer more control to the player and more realism and context as to why cities are built they way they are."
17671,Just use mods
17672,"Yes, this is the spiritual successor to SimCity you always wanted.  This may be the last city building game you ever need!  Maybe!  I don't want to be presumptuous."
17673,my girlfriend love it.  i recommand it to any sims lover.
17674,game is good
17675,its a great city building game
17676,"Love this game 10/10. People who complain about over price DLC need to get some jobs.. DLC is not expensive, coding and developing new contents is not free.. anyways, this game never gets old. I Love it/"
17677,Good
17678,performance and traffic system are terrible
17679,great simulator type game
17680,"It takes a bit to learn the controls, but once you get the hang of it it's so fun and realistic!"

17683,great game
17684,"Good game super relaxing. if you play a lot of intense games, take some time out of your day to relax with cities. or you can make it intense with the amazing community and developer support that continues to make the game more and more accurate."
17685,"great game

love playing it"
17686,Paid 15 euros for Fishing add-on. There is a bug in making fishing routes. Fake game! Do not buy!
17687,"If you enjoy any other city/zoo/theme park management game, you'll probably enjoy this game."
17688,Flint MI will look like its got a brand new water treatment system coming straight from the dew of tea leaves compared to what i'm about to do.
17689,"When it first came out, amazing and highly recommended.

Modern day, still amazing and highly recommended but really needs to be revamped in Cities Skylines 2 on a better engine.

Late game optimization is not great, it only uses a few CPU cores and my gpu is often twiddeling it's thumbs. Saving grace is the insane amount of community content and mods but optimization and overall performance suffers the more you add mods."
17690,I've played a few hours and can say it's pretty cool ...
17691,building
17692,This Game is great for relaxing and sitting back and just enjoying the game and all it has to offer. I enjoy looking at all the citizens going about their daily lives it's so detailed its a great game JUST BUY IT!!!
17693,Gud game
17694,"I enjoy this game. I admit that I have bankrupted more cities than I have succeeded. However, It is fun trying to create a good city. There are a lot of mods for this game that help you without making it easy which I like.  This is a good game to have and play."
17695,farts
17696,SUPER ADDICTIVE !!!!
17697,love this game.
17698,Brilliant game and great for playing alone and doesn't require any DLCs to enjoy it like so many other games.
17699,dont think i no a single bad thing about this game !!
17700,"everything is looks great, just one complain and some suggestion for people who having a few thought about this game

this is a very complex game and with no tutorial, just some quick guide with anoying notification, i can't even playing this game properly in third times i play without watching some tutorials on youtube. This game had a lot of dlc if you want to play with scenarion, but you still can enjoy this game without it. Besides of that this game had a few sparks and beauty itself when you finally understand how the flow of the cities works.

GREAT GAME 8 out 10 
"
17701,I liked how easy it is to access mods and create the city you want.
17702,"Great game for builders - OCD peeps will still want total control and no game so far can give you that, but this game gives you a lot of it - once you learn the mechanics.  So many mods and assets from the talented community to enjoy also.  Thumbs up!"
17703,good
17704,"Okay, I probably just suck. But I could not make a functional city that didn't look like a hot mess. Why do you hate symmetry, game? You're triggering my OCD. That being said, what other people have managed to create in this game is amazing. So it is probably just me."

*twin towers get struck by planes for a second time
*accidently shift right clicks and spawns a 5000ft tsunami and kills everyone in city"
17712,"You can destroy entire cities with tsunamis, endless fun"
17713,"its  the  best
"
17714,one of the better sim games
17715,"This is my first review of a game from Steam. I've played 30.4 hours on my 2016 MacBook Pro. The last time I played, I downloaded some mods and had loads of fun like I did every other time before. BUT, since then, I can't get the game to launch and I keep seeing a red triangle with an ""!"" point in the middle. I will completely change my review to a positive one but it is incredibly frustrating for the game to work then suddenly not. My laptop is up-to-date with software updates, so that's not a reason why."

17717,"good
"
17718,yaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaah
17719,so good you need to play this 5/5
17720,"not very good, but worth it on special 2.5/10"
17721,"Beats any other city game but buy it when its on sale as its expensive otherwise.

If you are going for 100% achievements then bear in mind that you need to purchase at least 9 DLC to make it possible to achieve the majority them."
17722,a good game to kill the hours and relax
17723,Best Game ever!!
17724,It's fun if you like extreme boredom.
17725,"Great city building game for people who want more involved city customization than Sim City allows. Would love to see the free roam option make it to this version, as it is one of the only things that I miss from console."
17726,.
17727,cool
17728,very fun game but for some reason it will crash on me but build road make home and people get sick out of no where so you have to deal with it
17729,love the game. got interested from waching biffa on youtube.
17730,"It's a beautiful game with a lot of content, but the fact it still has glaring flaws after YEARS of development and multiple huge DLC packages shows you how worthwhile it really is: not that worthwhile. Much like a Bethesda game, mods are practically required to not tear your hair out in annoyance at how stupid the game's default mechanics are, and some DLC packages replaced what was previously a totally fine industrial system with a boring micromanagement business simulation minigame. The game's fluid ""physics"" will baffle you, and the decisions of the people in the game will confuse you.

Also: No arcologies. For shame. The city sandbox genre really needs something better than Paradox to offer up something modern and beautiful that still keeps the charm of the classics."
17731,Fantastic game. Can't really say anything bad about it.
17732,A nice chill game
17733,pretty pog mate. dlc is a touch pricey tho
17734,"After 150 hours ive decided to update my review. 
Cs skylines is an amazing city building simulation game, dlcs are worthy of a download as these unlock more industries and assets etc, the base game itself is epic but with access to thousands of items on steams workshop including maps it brings the whole experience to a new level, this game is simply the best city building sim to date with pretty much unlimited options. The hardest part/only fault for me personally with the game is traffic management can be super tricky and bad road layouts can throttle a city really badly. 
If you enjoy city building games and simulation games in general you will love this game."
17735,Great
17736,coool game
17737,much gud game very gud
17738,Recommended for City builder fans. Get the DLCs on sale if you like them or the mods are good too.
17739,This game sucks me in for hours at a time! I really enjoy trying to create nice looking cities and watching them grow. You can also watch each person go about their day and run errands and I find that really cool. The modding community is great as well!
17740,its pretty fun
17741,"One of the best games I've had the fortune of playing. You can aim for perfection spend hours doing simple things. The more you play the more you feel you understand city planning in real life. Real life is far more complicated but This game provides enough realism let you say ""Whoever put a stop light here is an idiot.All they had to do was put a round about here and this line of 17 cars wouldn't have to wait through 3 lights to turn left."" Without bogging you down with  the reality of bureaucracy, politics and corruption, or the heart breaking reality that you just turned 300 homes into a shopping mall because it would make traffic flow better."
17742,"Great for building what you want, and lots of mods."
17743,Where is my SimCity?
17744,fun
17745, 
17746,good in depth city builder. play on console and pc.
17747,Crack.
17748,The ultimate city sim. So addictive.
17749,egergeg
17750,I have a good time playing this game.
17751,Game is very well developed. DLCs bring more fun and exploration to do. If you want to have a great time with your creativity this is your game.
17752,A
17753,.
17754,Well done
17755,"This game is a supper fun city building game. Though I would suggest playing with mods, the base game is good but can be difficult sometimes. Other then that I would highly suggest this game."
17756,if you like City building games this for you i like it Is cool the dls or dlc is good try it out
17757,"if you sit down for a little bit and if you know how the work its very fun
"
17758,Pog Game. Good way to waste a few hours or even days if you're not careful. traffic can be a nightmare to sort out at times (without mods) but overall a satisfying game to play
17759,"This game suffers from DLC syndrome, it costs a shit tone of money to buy the complete game, of course you can play just the base game which is the barest minimum. the game is 6 years old and they could have bundeled dlc from 2016-17 into the base game and kept the newer dlc p2p. To better explain the idea, you can pay to play the dlc when it releases or wait let's say 2 years for it to become free and by that I mean all dlc that released that year. And yes paradox can still make money, how? Simple, while that year's dlc lineup went f2p, 2 years of dlc are still p2p. Yeah my idea has some problems and I made up that concept in like 5 minutes while thinking what to write here. Soon this game is gonna end up like ea's sims. To get a complete sims 4 game you need to pay 500+€ for all dlc which is just insane and this game is going in the simmilar direction. Now of course both series have the option to play base game, but the base game is most of the time unplayeable without dlc and paradox's game that has that problem is Heart's or iron 4. All three games mentioned here are phenomenal but that price tag stinks."
17760,Best city builder I've played so far
17761,good
17762,good game
17763,Love it!
17764,"Still new to the game, but it seems nice."
17765,"Fantastic video game, one of the best out there. Love city Sims, and is even better with the disasters DLC. My only complaint, though, would be paradox's DLC policy and how every HAS to be in a DLC and cost WAY too much. Like come on, man.

17766,big city am i right?
17767,"good game to built city i guess
"
17768,so gay but so good.
17769,It's very good!!
17770,very good game but hard to be good just need to practice myself.
17771,"I love building cities. I've always had a passion for mapping out and drawing large urban areas. From shifting the terrain to match a certain style, to strategically placing large downtown buildings, to choosing which street light will light up which street, the details this game provides with each category is exactly why I spend so much time on this game."
17772,"Very good city building game, or in fact one of the best I have played. Would recommend it over any other city building game, and I simply experienced no sense of regret purchasing it."
17773,its cities skyline. one of the best city building game. u must have this one on your library!
17774,"This game made the best city simulation to date. It is beautiful and you will love and hate the traffic mechanic that is truly the core part of this game if you ask me.
Just never watch a youtube video of some artist making the perfect city from every rock, building, parking lot, ahhhh.
Your city is beautiful too and good luck not going into debt."
17775,ayo this game sus
17776,"This game is very good for bringing out your inner creativity to make something cool. It is by far the best city building game out there with good graphics, few bugs, and overall good quality. The only issues include the games performance and the general game play. Performance for the game can be pretty good up until a point where you have done so much to your world that it is super slow and down right unplayable. For game play, it starts out well with your little city and all is well and fun. But later on in the game, many of the things in the game start to become samey and boring which usually end up killing your drive to play on a same city for a while. Mods can help with the game play by adding more complexity and uniqueness but end up really hurting the performance. As usual with paradox, the dlc is atrociously expensive and can really hurt your creativity in the game by not having them. Would recommend to almost anyone who likes a chill time making whatever you please."
17777,"Nobody reads the reviews for sure, so I'll say I'm gay"
17778,its very fun
17779,Cities Skylines Is An Amazing Game To Not Only Build A City But Also Just Send Meteor's At Your City.
17780,You can be very creative with the cities you create.
17781,Best traffic fixing simulator I've played so far.
17782,Now where can I put this road?  NO power !!!! What do you mean the cims are sick? There is no end to taking care of your little cims and their many needs. . . .
17783,"By far the best city construction sandbox I ever played, there is no match for it on the market, game was also free few times and dlcs are almost every year on discount so you can get them for cheap. Also there is a lot of potential for more stuff in this game, but you have mods on workshop which assist you perfect in the game."
17784,Lot's of different ways to play
17785,about half the amount of dlc as payday 2 (which is still fucking insane) but even without dlc the game is a blast
17786,"If you like Sim City, this game takes it to the next level."

with mods and dlcs: infinite hours of immense fun.

if you don't mind almost having a mental break down because of fictious traffic jams on fictious roads in your  fictious cities, you should definitely give this game a go. (especially since solving said traffic jam and simply watching everything in your city funtioning smoothly is an addicting excperience in itself!)"

17793,"I've searched for a game like this for a while.
At first I saw it in my recommended page on my youtube decided to see what this game is and I could'nt stop playing it since i bought it.

Great game!"
17794,"It's a pretty fun game ... at this point it's quite hard to rate the base game on it's own as the DLC and numerous mods / community made assets truly are what have given this game it's longevity. 

100% would recommend if you're into any kind of simulation / city builders."
17795,"Once you figure out how to run a small neighborhood without complete collapse of basic facilities, this game turns scary addictive. I'm p sure I spent hours telling myself ""I'll just finish up the police stations in this district then I'll quit and be a productive member of reality."" Had to stop bc apparently civic engineering is literally a scheduled controlled substance and I got hooked and now I work for a zoning committee. If you care about your friends don't let them design cities"
17796,Lots of detail.
17797,city big go city yes
17798,"If you liked Sim City This game is 100 times better. I must warn you though at times it will frustrate the heck out of you, but always keep you coming back for more. Its a great game if you want to sharpen your math skills and be fun at the same time."
17799,fun as hell
17800,"big yes






























big yes"
17801,A fun city builder game.  A lot of dlc though which I'm not a fan of.  Overall I would recommend it.
17802,This game  is so glitchy for mac.
17803,I used to make fun of traffic engineers and city planners for building out a horrible road system in my city.  but now I understand their struggle... I still make fun of them though (:

17822,one of the best games
17823,"Visually very nice game and it relaxing to build the city. 
City building and budget managing is quite easy while the details in the game mechanics stay sort of hidden. 
Vanilla game is fun until you reach something like 50k population after witch the expanding of city keeps repeating itself and everything looks the same. The only target of the game seems to be able to manage and maximize the profit, or the happiness of population or attractiveness for tourism, etc, at endgame which itself is not too rewarding. 
With DLC or HUGE AMOUNT OF SINGLE ITEM MODS game could be more diverse but DLC not for the max price and mods are quite heavy to manage. 
If Steam had ""it depends"" button I'd press that one. 
Satisfied my need for no goal, visual city builder."

17830,Great game to just relax and build.
17831,"There's things I like about it and things I don't, but overall if you are into builders, you will have some fun with this game. The numerous DLC's available are an added bonus.
Biggest complaint so far, she is a memory hungry beast."

17850,"my citizens are all assholes

8/10 awesome game"
17851,very good game and chilling too so if you have nothing to play and stressed out i recommenced this game
17852,"Yeah, I mean this game would be really good if you could install unlimited mods, right now this game is so broken that the amount of mods you can install, depends on how much ram you pc has, basically if you want to install over 200 mods, which is not a lot in this game, then you would need a minimum of 12-16 gb of ram"
17853,Great Game with Infinite Possibilities!!!
17854,cus it good
17855,I've played CS for several years. I even took a long break and came back to it. I now have all of the DLCs and a 170k population city. This game is simply amazing!
17856,I love the game except i would get this glitch where about 80% of my screen would be gray and i couldn't do anything and id have to restart my pc.
17857,i like i like killing city HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAH
17858,Nice replacement for simcity. I've enjoyed it so far. Though I'm a little skeptical about all the paid for extra content...

17877,Decent traffic management sim. just not my type of game. Played without dlc or mods. Pretty sure mods would help with tedious issues. Couldn't seem to merge traffic effectively. traffic would sometimes get congested and backup. so it would end up with a clear highway but a huge blockage of merging cars stopping the highway. when too me it looked fine. reached 100k pop. got all except eden monument (Didn't want to do requirements). but if you are looking for a game to play in the background of other tasks. I would recommend this game.
17878,its fun and easy to understand once you get the hang of it
17879,Best city simulation game
17880,"Its fun, slow paced game to unwind with. Bit of a learning curve, and you will want to consider the DLC when it goes on sale. I suck hard at these games and can get a good size city going, and I look forward to getting back into the game each time I play"
17881,"Unleash your creativity
"
17882,"best city builder to date, loads of assets and mods in steam workshop"
17883,like it!
17884,"Listen, this is a epic Joe Biden game. if you like the United State you'll love this game."
17885,"very fun amazing game, Although i play heavily modded it makes the game even better highly reccommend!"
17886,"epic, 9/10 because i need to install a ton of mods to increase realism lmfao"
17887,good pass time
17888,
17889,One of the best city builder games. So many fun levels / mods / everything you want and more.
17890,good

17892,yes
17893,game gud end report
17894,cool then boring not worth 30 bucks
17895,yeet yeet
17896,Great game all around
17897,"It's an interesting game. Don't be tempted into buying packs and installing community assets. Just play the game. Watch a few intro videos, set all taxation to 11%. Citizen health is a must, so pay attention to how WASTE and CONTAMINATION is handled.... - I like playing with my wife. Sometimes we watch some youtube videos about the game, and we get an idea and try to do that. It's fun. My younger kid plays it. The interface could be a bit more polished for keyboard control, considering the hierarchical UI.

17898,Everything you want in a city planing game
17899,Made a giant canal of sewage and released it into the city and then proceeded to meteor strike the hospitals. There were no survivors. Brilliant Game 8/10
17900,It is fun to play when I need a break from other games.
17901,me build road
17902,this game is chad
17903,it is good
17904,"very cool, had much fun"
17905,"If this game was merely a city builder the depth of game play and detail would make it best of its' kind. But with the addition of workshop content and the ability to tour your own city from a variety of perspectives it becomes much more. while watching your build come to life, it becomes a diorama, an elaborate train set, or the city you dreamed to build while playing with hot wheels on dirt roads. 

the game has never failed to perform or crashed on my pc and i have a ton of dlc content in use. the community support for this game is staggering.  from an old timer who began gaming with Pong, this product is the finest gaming experience i have had in 50 years."
17906,Very fun and addicting.
17907,This game single-handedly taught me I can never be a civil engineer.
17908,A game for people who want to show their creativity!
17909,"Very cool city building game! If you are stuck on which Strategy game to play, I recommend this one, it is very interesting when you start your first city and you start to discover all kinds of things in this game to play around with. You need a beefy PC to play this game. I really recommend to download some mods from the workshop or buy a DLC in the future"
17910,rt game played it
17911,Yes

17922,"Generally a good game, but I wish it were more customizable and consisted of more choices. For instance, why can we not build a metro station right underneath the roads (as we can in some other games)? I would love to see this kind of change happen for greater flexibility."

17951,This game is So addictive and fun I adore it
17952,"Cities skylines is engaging. You'll open cities skylines and lose 8 hours. It is so engaging to build and expand your city like the little industrialist you are. The only real challenge in the game is learning to use Dams and trying to perfect traffic. The game sports loads of depth and customisation. However I found that there are some functions that should have button toggles by default, like the bulldoze function.

4/5"

I Loved this game before because it is a game where I can use mods so that I won't have any hassle in constructing anything.. I just need a therapeutic game no stress. But with the latest update.. sigh!!!! It  sucks.. It is not a therapeutic game now.. mods are gone and can't us them now.. the mods option on the menu is gone. 


awesome Game. it is 3d, realistic type of way to create your city. It has realistic needs as well of the people (inhabitant of your city)."
17957,"why would i in the right set of mind recommend this game to any one? it takes up all my time! ALL OF IT!
i played 15 hours of it and then on 16th hour it felt like a brand new game!

will i recommend that you buy this game? only if you want to stop playing every other game in your library!!!

Cities Skylines is an excellent game."

17991,"While the game itself is not really bad the monetization in this game is disgusting. This game is not worth $60 nor the hundreds that they demand in dlc. They turn nickel and diming into an art style. 

 The base game can be fun yet stagnates pretty fast. Things that you might assume would be in the base game, aren't. Like a prison for example, that's in one of the many many dlc packs... why?

Some other things that are worth mentioning. The actual city planning is pretty basic, which is fine enough just kinda disappointing. The game AI is also pretty unstable; let me explain. I originally bought this game on Xbox. After many, many, many failed attempts I finally had a large successful city. This were going very well for myself and I was happy... until my people started getting sick. It took me a minute to realize polluted water had got into my drinking water and was poisoning my people, bummer. I corrected the problem and thought all was well, nope. While my city continued to grow and expand a fairly large amount of business's struggled and would close. New business's would build atop of the old and would fail some how fail to draw business to themselves despite never having that problem before.. I have no idea why.

There is one positive. Watching a cop, firefighter, medic phase through a building and come back out can be pretty funny. Yes people. They walk right through the building completely ignoring the door"
17992,"so recommend cause you can flood the city 
"
17993,Its a fun game.
17994,"I bought this game a week ago. For $82 I got the base game and it included 3 DLCs: Sunset, Industries, and Mass Transit. Within a week I bought every other DLC. They were like $15 each, so why not? As well, I got a few creator content packs. Game play is pretty straightforward, not unlike playing SimCity or Cities XL but I feel Cities Skylines is more complete than its predecessors."
17995,"69 hours of gameplay 



                                                                                nice..."
17996,Easily my favorite city builder. A mostly relaxing way to pass a few hours. Likely to negatively impact your backlog; time vanishes when this game is running.

18008,much wow
18009,"i love this game so so so much. ive spent so many hours making cities of my dreams with in-depth transit systems, full industries, big parks and districts and so, so much more. in fact my original review was a thumbs up. the upcoming dlc which adds pedestrian zones is something ive wanted for years now and im so happy to finally get it. however, this game has a major flaw which sucks for anyone picking it up for the first time or existing players wanting to get new content - the heavy, heavy amount of required dlc. the base game is so bad and so barebones that i cant just recommend this game to someone as there is almost nothing to do after the first few hours of a city. this game requires MULTIPLE $12-$14 dlcs to be even slightly fun. if you want to pick up cities: skylines, be aware of how much dlc you'll need for the game to start truly being the masterpiece it could be. a slight issue is also that the engine is outdated and old, so bigger cities start to suffer from lag / various optimization problems. however, i understand how hard it could be to update a game to a newer engine without so much breaking so i dont fault the devs as much as i do the first part. please just re-release the game as like $60-70 with all the major dlc paradox, it would be so much better for everyone"
18010,This game is super addictive best indepth city cuilder you will find. SO much DLC though
18011,"This game and the workshop creators never cease to amaze me. Just when you think you've done everything you thought you could in a city, BOOM!, new content comes out and a whole new world is presented in front of you."
18012,"I clearly love this game, with 500+ hours played. I can create road system and just sit there and watch traffic flow. This simulator is awesome, and allows for so much creativity through the extensive mods that the community has created. My only suggestion is you up your RAM to at least 16 GB to get the full experience (and not crash out on bigger cities)"
18013,"Played this during COVID19 lockdown, sometimes stayed up till 4am. Literally saw highways and red traffic percentages in my sleep. Would think about traffic patterns and how to make traffic better on my afternoon walks. Would walk past intersections in real life and think ""traffic sucks.""

18017,"An excellent game - very cheap (my friend bought it for me on sale for around $4) and plenty extra DLCs although I personally feel that some DLCs should be part of the game/free with main game purchase. Countless hours of gameplay to get lost in, design anything and everything and depending on what DLCs you have, activate them for extra realism/challenges. Smooth game play and beautiful graphics. A replacement for those older folks like me who remember Sim City from the earlier years. In addition, there is a great community with mods, maps and other extras one can download and use within the game. I recommend this game if you enjoy detailed and diverse city building games. You won't find a better game at current like City Skylines. Well done Devs.

[hr][/hr]
[quote=Jane Jacobs] Cities have the capability of providing something for everybody, only because, and only when, they are created by everybody. [/quote]

A quote from an canadian author named [b] Jane Jacobs [/b], which represents the assenc of the game very well.

After you selected a map the game starts with a small tutorial, in which you learn the basics on how you build a city, that kind of runs ok. If you want a bigger and nicer city, you simpley have to build more and take a closer look on the needs of your citizens. 

[hr][/hr]
[h1] Graphics [/h1]

The game was realesed in 2015, so the graphics are not that overwehlming or anything like that. The details of buildings are nice, people walking or cars driving arround in the city look ok, the enviroment or scencs in genrall look also good and effects like fire or explosions are ok but sometimes look a little bit janky. The water physics are very good and can play a big roll in the way of how you play the game, if you allow it ;).

[b] 13/20 Points [/b]

[hr][/hr]
[h1] Gameplay [/h1]

As i said in the beginning to make a city big and nice you just have to keep building, if you see that there is demand for any of the three differnt zones (residential (green) zones,  commercial (blue) zones and industrial (orange) zones), just build more streets and assign that new free space to one of these three zones.

There is no real main goal in this game. You just build stuff and try to keep your revenue higher then your expenditure. The only real mission is to survive and not lose all your money. From time to time your citizens give you small quests which you can complete. If you like a big sandbox you will like it and if you want a game, with a little bit of guidance and you know story quests or something like that, you will probably be a little bit overwehlmed at the beginning. Either way, if you play these kinds of games, you will probably like it.

On top of the normal stuff you can build like police stations, fire stations, hospitals or schools. You can also build tourist attractions, a football field, sewer pipes, water pumps or dams. There are definitely many things to build in this game. I never played/bought the DLCs, they add some content to the game i guess, but in my opinion they are not really needed because the game has a [b] Workshop [/b], so there is plenty of content in the base game already. If you are intrested in DLCs you can buy them when there is a sale or something.

[b] 15/20 Points [/b]

[hr][/hr]
[h1] Fun [/h1]

Fun is allways a subjective thing. I played the game occasionally and the few hours i have in this game where fun to play. Watching your city grow and adding more and more buildings and streets until it runs independent is definitely satisfying to watch. If you like this game in the long run is up to you. I imagine if you play it 24/7 it can get boring after a while, because there are structures on how to build your city, that give you a lot more money then other. Still had fun with it :)

[b] 15/20 Points [/b]

[hr][/hr]
[h1] Conclusion [/h1]

City: Skylines is a good game, with a lot of content. You watch your city grow and make more and more money. The Graphics are something between ok and good. In compersion to other games of this genre it is definitely on the good side.

[b] Finall Score: 43/60 Points [/b]

18079,Mods are great.
18080,Spent far too long making a road system that looked like a pee pee that actually worked. Best use of my time ever
18081,The most in-depth and customisable city sim out there.
18082,Everyone in my first city died because of contaminated water. That's quite catastrophic lol.
18083,"Very nice game!!! One of my favourites. It's very extensive, which allows you to make a realistic city with realistic statistics and stuff. If you're looking for a city building game, this game is the one to buy! :)"
18084,"Most addicting game ever, looked away from the clock and played for 6 hours straight without noticing."
18085,better than simcity
18086,"I'd like to state upfront that I don't think this is a terrible game or that in general I say no one should get it. It's just that ultimatly after hours and hours of playing it, I can't in good faith really recommend this game for what it is.  Because what this game in reality is a traffic simulator with a vestigial city-sim attached. 

In developing this game, it's really obvious that the traffic aspect was an idea that they were really proud of.  Rather than cars being just visual representations of the traffic metadata as in other city sims, Skylines opts to give every vehicle an identity. Every vehicle exists in the game and has a purpose. And if it takes too long on the road to achieve that purpose, issues naturally arise.  Suddenly, a busy intersection means garbage trucks don't make it to homes and buildings, hurses don't make it to pick up dead bodies, and so on. Things back up, and suddenly your whole city is falling apart. 

The problem for me is that while this is an interesting and no doubt complexly coded idea, it's not realistic. In real life, traffic ebbs and flows throughout the day, people take different routes to avoid high traffic times, etc. If you're going to go so far out of your way to develop this insanely needy traffic system that your whole city lives and dies based on it, what does it ultimately mean if it doesn't adequately represent what it's trying to simulate? And sure, that metagame IS interesting, I can't lie about that. It's easy to get caught up for hours playing the game trying to maximize your traffic efficiency. But it's also exhausting after a while. I'm writing this review after spending probably 20+ hours on a city and eventually just giving up on it after I made a small expansion out into a new area and finding that one change completely wrecked traffic for a huge segment of my city. Up until that point I had been having fun, a few high points were making a popular tourist destination and damming up a river to make a hydroelectric plant. The Dam was especially fun because even though I found an excellent spot, initially it wasn't generating electricity because all the water was flowing off in an opposite direction down an alternate river, so I used a bit of terraforming to block off that alternate route, only to have the dam fill up and overflow into my city, so I had to create a canal to deal with the overflow, sending the excess water off into the sea elsewhere.  It was a genuinely interesting set of issues that came up and the mechanics, and physics, involved were really cool.  

But now I sit and am quite disinterested in expanding any further because, again, I have to figure out traffic, I have to play this traffic metagame that is only so interesting before it becomes tedious. And sure, I get that maybe I'm just not good enough or smart enough, but that's fine. I'm able to admit that maybe the game is what beat me in the end. Ultimately the game stopped being fun for me so I stopped playing. The bulk of my hours I sank into the game were from when I first got it, up to around 2017. At that time I gave up on it for similar reasons to why I am now, and now I feel the same, this time only making it two weeks before I'm just exhausted and done. 

For future city-sims, I'd recommend they do their traffic like SimCity 4 did. In that game, the traffic was essentially just a visual representation of the traffic metadata going on in the background, but also the cars did have some identity and purpose, too. It seemed to do something similar to what Cities: Skylines does now, but better and less overwhelming. 

And it's frustrating, I want to enjoy this game. There's a lot to recommend and it seems like it should have been a great game to fill the void left by SimCity.  In all realism I imagine I'll come back to the game. I'm like an old-school WoW player, I always come back."
18087,"awesome simulation
"
18088,I like. good graphics. Best city simulator i Know. Poor performance. Poor traffic AI. Can be optimized. Look to mods for that.

18104,Best city builder out there!
18105,
18106,There is something fascinatingly pleasing about being able to test your thoughts and hypotheses around what tomorrow's utopian city could look like. You install Cities Skylines in response to a deep seated sense of hope for the future and mankind. Then you inevitably build a dystopian mess and realize you don't have all the answers to man's ilks. 5/7 Perfect score.
18107,"fun, a week of my life. still haven't made a good city though... lol"
18108,e
18109,"Great game, with semi-realistic city managing mechanic. You can customize every aspect in your city:
-First, you can use prop to custom everywhere
-Second, ajust your budget to make sure no minus weekly income
-Third, you can name your city and it's district, buildings and street name
Too much aspect for me to tell, if you isn't saftistying with built-in game you can use mod and assets
Note:
It's resource demand game, depend of your city's population and size of city.
(Sorry for my bad english sentences, i live in vietnam)"
18110,I discovered city building with sim city 4. Cities Skylines is by far the best city building game ever.  I love that people can create things for the game and we can use them. This game is just amazing.

18139,"Great game. Every time I hit a plateau, I either do research to get past it, or just start a new game at a new location. Once things get intense like managing population and economical flow of your city, then it gets challenging--or I'm just not good at it. Honestly great game, I always come back to it over time. I also like the perspective of miniature view, and if you're able to support good graphics, it's like looking into a dollhouse that's the size of a city!"
18140,m
18141,"Plenty of fun to be had, even without DLC (though it is unfortunate to see so much DLC).

Mods are not required, but needed if you wish to customize your city with any efficacy or have a selection of maps. With multiple mods / custom maps, the game can get somewhat buggy / slow. 

Overall, an above average / excellent buy if you like simulation games. Without mods, this game would be a visually pleasing mediocre city builder."
18142,good
18143,"build city, pleases monkey brain."
18144,"Honestly, if you're after a city building game, his is the one you're likely going to be drawn to.

Only one flaw that really stands out for me however that I hope is fixed in the future, but I'm not sure it's able to be fixed.
And that Flaw is the fact that the more the mod the game with new assets and feature fixes.. the less you're able to just load the game from saves repeatedly without the game buggering up and being unplayable.
Eventually, you'll get to the point where you'll reflexively quit the entire program, and then restart it to load a save because you buggered up on something."

18188,"This is an absolute masterpiece of a citybuilding game - IF YOU CAN LAUNCH THE GAME. I have never had SO MUCH problem with a game than this before. It keeps crashing over and over again, when launching and when ingame. I have a strong computer, I have watched alot of guides how to fix it but it still don´t work properly. I can get into the game at one time, after a while of building it crashes from nowhere. And after that it doesnt matter how many times I try to start the game, even after a number of restarts. And everything you have done just disappears. SO. If you play the game, make sure you have auto saves turned ON."

18214,I love wrecking the economy of my cities and watching people (much like real life) complain on twitter.
18215,"I like this game a lot; enough to actually buy it after pirating some years ago. It is however plagued by a metric ton of dlc, the closest I get to actually playing lately is opening the game and realizing that I don't actually have the whole game and promptly closing the game. The base game has enough to keep you interested for maybe a little bit but ultimately leaves you wanting more. I do not recommend giving these people somewhere in the neighborhood of $200 for the full game, not to mention the new launcher with a sketchy EULA."

18243,"Now this is the kind of game I hate for the wrong reasons... every time I get an hand on it, I get lost in time and I forget the most basic things in life, like sleeping, eating, and others not so nice. The game is addicting for who likes to build and manage and the level of detail is really appealing. The traffic management is a real add on to many city builders who don't manage it so well and more realistic in the routes that creates all the zones. As for DLC's I would like to point out something to the haters. Some years ago, when the games where in CD's and Diskettes and the internet was still showing up as something NASA'wise at an amazing speed of 48kbps, some games would have a (not quite) yearly release, which was an improvement from the last batch, using the last developments in software and hardware. Nowadays the development from those days has been so huge, that a game like this, does not need to make a yearly release (maybe within 10 years, maybe), but seems very nice from developers to keep creating new stuff for the game, and I'm not speaking about ""creators packs"", but real stuff that ""moves"" the game. Thumbs up and I only wish to get more of this type of games with this quality."
18244,"very good city building game, organizing traffic is frustrating but also makes for a good challenge. There are also plenty of fun mods to use."

18252,"The game is super fun and relaxing, and if you are the person that like to have some music in the backgrounde you have found the perfect game for that.
The games many DLC and mods are super nice and add a whole nother game feeling and realism to the game. The DLC's are often on sale so I recomend you take a good look at one, three or all of them when they are.

The game gives a great challenges for regular and educated people.

Small problems that I enconuntered while I played the game:
City skylines is a very good game, but that over time when the city gets bigger and bigger takes a lot of ram. So I recommend  that you have a least have 16gb ram or more on your computer.

Mods
the more you play the game, the more you realize that the game is more fun and realistic with mods. but if you later on find a mod that dosen't work on your game, but a youtuber or a friend can use it, it can mean that they are using a DLC that the mod must use to function properly with on it's own but also with 
other mods."

My favorite feature, by far, is the ability to download mods off the Steam workshop, which offers far more additions than the Mod Browser on Console. It allowed me to build a city of my dreams with everything I wanted thanks to mods. I'll never have to install Sim City ever again."

18294,"Cities: Skylines is an amazing city builder with a plethora of fun and creative challenges that you need to overcome to keep building your city. The level of detail when it comes to zoning, road types, road locations, industry, municipalities, education, and more. There are a few downsides to the game however. The game is not very well optimized for lower end computers and at higher populations, things like to glitch as well as slow down mid-end computers even. The other issue is the lack of traffic control and AI path finding logic. Having people stay in the same lane, blocking traffic, because they wouldn't go around a damn bus. The last major issue I have with Cities: Skylines is how expensive the DLC are. I know it's another Paradox Interactive game and they all have 10x the price of the game in DLC but these are core mechanics of the game that are being affected. It's a little ridiculous to make the game significantly easier after buying the DLC because, while the DLC adds new problems to be solved, the mechanics added to solve those new problems also solve old problems better than the base game did. Now, there are some good parts to this game too. As previously mentioned, Cities: Skylines has an impressively intricate level of managing the smallest of details. You can customize stoplights or stop signs, you can create walking paths or make multi-level underground highways. You can create a district that permits the recreational use of drugs, or ban industrial traffic. You can create a dense megalopolis, or a sprawling suburbia. You can create a industrial town that profits off of its exports or a tourist trap that profits off of the thousands of people coming to visit you daily. The free range is incredible, and with the deep level of detail unlike any other game, it is a fantastic purchase."

18298,"As someone who has never written a review for anything before, I just want to say that after nearly 300 hours in this game - I would definitely recommend it for anyone that wants to get into city building games. Highly recommended."
18299,It's a great game. How intensive the gameplay is will be up to the player. There is plenty of DLC depend on what you want to see in your city. I personally haven't bought one I consider ESSENTIAL to gameplay except industries. Everything else varies depending on what the city I am creating at the moment will be.
18300,"nice
"
18301,best city building game by far.
18302,Sick graphics
18303,this game has some real depth to it. i love how in depth you can go into making a really beautiful city.
18304,Awesome game.
18305,"Just like every Paradox game, the base is a little fun but you eventually come up against problems that can be solved super easily... provided you shell out some extra for 5 DLCs. Otherwise you're stuck with a game that's not really quite fit for purpose. Solution: Don't buy from Paradox."
18306,"This game is by far my favorite game on steam. It's great on console, but utilizing the mods and assets that the steam workshop offers at no additional cost is essential to getting the best possible experience from Cities: Skylines. 10/10 Totally worth $30!"

18308,"This is a great game that offers many challenges along the way from schooling your population, wellness, traffic, work and so much more. 

Feel free to build your own or take one of the prepared challenges. 

A great community and mod support. Also check out the DLC's."
18309,"Congratulations on breaking the game with this unsolicited, unnecessary piece of shit launcher! Now I can't play because this garbage does not open"

18311,"Still my fav city building game, by far"
18312,Amzing
18313,yes
18314,The only reason I don't recommend this game is because half the game is paywalled. If you can get the base game on sale I'd recommend it then
18315,"This game starts interesting and then with all of the community available mods, discussions, videos, etc., there is plenty of opportunity to expand or tweek to your liking!
Great combo!"

18375,ok
18376,Probably the best city builder out at the moment.  Lots of mods available if ya want em.  I play mostly stock with like 4 mods total I think.  If you liked Civ 6 or really any Civ game you will probably like this one.  Very good and rather entertaining.
18377,"I've okayed this game on both PC and Console and I can say they're both equally as fun! So much to do and create, the workshop will expand your game play experience. Would highly recommend!"
18378,A modern version of Sim City
18379,I liked the massive community support for this game and the fact that the developers have embraced the community with open arms.
18380,"This game has opened my eyes to city planning. I cannot go anywhere now without thinking, ""oh this is a nice street layout"" or ""Wow this interchange is actually pretty effective, I think I will make one in the game"" or ""Oh wow this intersection is terrible, I have 6 ideas on how to change it to increase traffic flow"". 

In anycase, I recommend this game"
18381, Very fun and chill game. You should really play it.
18382,Good city building game. If you are creative you can create one hell of a good looking city (disclaimer: I'm not). But you can have much fun either way. Just buy it if you are a strategy/building sim fan.
18383,Like sim city but better 10/10

18398,me build city it fun
18399,Build build build
18400,"Very fun game, however, some of the DLC should be in the base game and not DLC at all"
18401,too much content locked behind dlc while the core gameplay could still use improvement
18402,Epic Game watch RT play it
18403,Too much content locked behind paywalls. The game itself is only meh at best and at worst a dlc farm. There are better games for your gaming dollar that do not do this.
18404,very great. install mods. makes game more fun.
18405,"Have not tried the DLC yet but honestly the base game here is pretty good. If you like SimCity type games, then you will like Cities: Skylines. It gud."
18406,i hate this [bleep]ing game. buy it.
18407,This game is definitely a huge recommendation in my book! It's pretty fun to play whenever you're sitting wondering what to do.
18408,"It's a great game, progress is never too slow and there are tons of mods to make it more fun and customizable. Easily one of my favorite games to play."
18409,Good game to waste time on
18410,meh
18411,too violent
18412,One of the best if not the very best traffic manager game. Building a city up and making it your own is more satisfying than anything i have ever done. Messing with all the policies and all the mass transit and trying to get them to all compliment each other is as much strategy as any warfare game i have played.
18413,cities.. skylines.. this game has it all!
18414,Best city builder available today. While in some ways it is more of a traffic simulator than a city builder (I mean that's what real cities are to be fair) It is still really enjoyable and most importantly it has Linux support!

18419,Worst city game I've ever played. All content is locked behind dlcs that cost just as much if not more than the base game
18420,Great game
18421,Awesome game if you are into planning and logistics. Fun and rewarding while still be challenging and frustrating at the same time. Make sure you watch some Mod youtube videos to get started.
18422,"If my saves didn't keep corrupting even though I'm saving to hard drive and I have multiple backups that also seem to corrupt (and the fact that this seems to be a problem thats been around for 7 years), I'd give it a positive review."
18423,Best available city builder.
18424,you know simcity 2013? yeah forget that and buy this
18425,"Build whatever you want, however you want, and watch the ""Twitter"" emoticon for hints on how your citizens feel about your Mayorism. The last R-C-I City-building game I played was SimCity 2000, and this game is a modernized version of that one, with 100% better game mechanics. The only thing I wish I could do was summon disasters like I could in 2000. One BIG issue with this game is now features and mechanics are locked under DLC, and maybe the weather mechanics are locked that way. The rotation of features and mechanics under DLC are so massive and rapid, that I get overwhelmed with options and I'm not really ever sure what mechanics and features are ""new"" to the game."
18426,just amazing.
18427,Still the GOAT for city builders.  Intensely relaxing game-play and beautiful visuals.  I always come back to Cities: Skylines.
18428,Great Game
18429,Just by the hours I've played this game you should know whether I like it or not...
18430,it like real cities
18431,   v
18432,good game to kill time
18433,"If you're looking for a game that took Sim City to the next level. This is the game. You have complete control over your city from start to finish. The maps that you start out on do have road connections and sometimes even rail connections. You start out on a plot of land, and as your city grows, you can purchase more plots and unlock more buildings and services that you can better serve your citizens. Must have game if you are into city building."
18434,Nice Game. Btw  I have lost my life family all of my money my wife divorced me but its worth it
18435,Honestly worth the money if you like city building
18436,i just like build up games. therefor i enjoyed playing it. regulations and limitations you have to deal with wilest playing without mods are a little frustrating. BUT OVERALL IT IS BIG AND ENDLESS FUN!
18437,Im addicted and i was never into city building
18438,Its a very german game: the answer to your problems are the autobahn and colour segregation.
18439,best city builder of all time
18440,A very fun and creative new city building sandbox game! As a fan of other games such as Tropico I quickly began to like the new feature and ideas of the City Skyline and with Modern Graphics and tools it is a great and fun game to relax to!
18441,Very good at building artist skills.

18443,Not a bad game if youre into city development and watching your creation rise/fall

18449,"This game is very good, If you are interested in building cities and managing traffic then this game if for you. However, if you want lots of DLC and Assets/mods then you will need lots of ram. I have 24GB and still max it out. But if you only want a few mods and DLC then most computers can run it at aleast 30FPS."

18463,"This game is probably the best city building game ever. I say probably only because Sim City 4 is my all time favorite and nothing will really ever beat that game. I shudder to think how many hours I had playing that game, but it was nearly 15 years of playing it off and on. So many mods and details to work out... anyway, Cities Skylines brings nearly the same level of customization (if not more) with mods and DLC.
The only drawback is now that Paradox owns it, it will slowly deteriorate into DLC madness. Hopefully, mod compatibility remains, because this game is one of the best."
18464,"What a great time killer this game is. Simple systems, clever interactions, and just enough flexibility that no two cities are the same. Highly recommend it. And this my second time buying it! (Had it all on PS4 before)."
18465,"the roads!managing the road network of the city is a huge part of the game.most of the time its fine, but when it gets to the late game you start to notice the issues. traffic doesn't act like real world traffic, which is really frustrating for a simulation game. i can see why its done like it is,it just doesn't like it when your trying to pack people efficiently into a tiny area (ie building a city)
depending who you are that may not be problem in itself, the early and mid game is still enjoyable, and i imagine there's ways of manipulating the games traffic to get the best effect, regardless of reality.

its also worth mentioning the shear amount of DLC. i don't have a problem with companys making additional content but not when its such minor stuff, and not when its shoved in your face. the idea that the 'full' game is worth £160 is laughable."
18466,"I personally love Cities Skylines, and I've been playing it since its inception. I can't remember if there ever was an open beta, or if I just bought it at launch, but I was there when it started. I've played countless hours of Sim City 4: Rush Hour, and with EA basically killing of the series, this was the perfect spiritual successor.
My only gripe with this game is that the business model they chose is to churn out dlc after dlc to sustain it. These dlcs are pretty good though, and they add a lot of new features and value, too, so you'll end up wanting them. If you want to start playing CS, my suggestion would be to start off small, buy an expansion at a time, and learn it thoroughly, because otherwise you'll end up spending a lot of money, and not really using and learning what you bought. The only DLC I'm not really convinced with is the Industry one, because while it's a lot of content and I like it all, it kind of overrides the old functions and specialization of industry districts. But that's just me, and maybe I'm just bad at industry, idk.
I wouldn't recommend the vanilla experience of the game, either. There are a lot of mods that I think are crucial to have a good time, first and foremost: the Traffic Manager. Without it you'll be forced to fiddle with different widths of roads to make perfect intersections to try and avoid traffic jams that will eventually kill your cities when you reach a certain pop cap.

In the end, if you want a good city builder sim, I think this one is probably the best, and if you want to git gud at it, I recommend following someone you like on YT. The one I like and follow is Biffa, who also has an expansive collection in the workshop you can subscribe to, not to get lost in the petabytes of mods and assets available."
18467,"The game it self is fine. Too many expensive DLCs that could easily be cheaper, has a terrible launcher from paradox that always crashes all my computers in my center, and the game it self is very unoptimized with all the DLCs and all the recent updates. The game was doing fine, and paradox killed it. That's a thumbs down from me."
18468,Clever and enjoyable.
18469,This game reeeealy makes you feel like batman
18470,i like it when all my hard work gets destroyed by misplacing a canal very cool
18471,good game
18472,good game
18473,lovin' it
18474,"This game is fantastic. I've always been a big fan of cities layouts as well as interstates and road grids, and this game satisfies all of my loves. Couldn't recommend this game enough. The DLC is not required, but it does expand and improve on the existing game. Overall excellent and fun game."
18475,"Pros:
I do indeed highly recommend this game. It allows the player to express their creativity in designing cities. From all the different aspects of the game, and to the simple yet complex play-style.  Cities: Skylines will bring many hours of enjoyment.  The workshop allows you to mod the game extremely easily, which can encourage even more creativity. 

Cons: 
Cities: Skylines does take up a ton of RAM while the game is running. I have a gaming computer and it is near impossible to have 3+ apps open including the game. The game does tend to crash randomly for reasons that i am not aware of.

DLC:
Yes, the game does have DLC. I have purchaced all of the main DLC packs, there are some DLC's that are worth the money, and some that are not. If you are looking for a full game experience, then yes, the DLC's are worth it.

In general i do love Cities: Skylines and do highly reccomend the game! :)"
18476,"I have thoroughly enjoyed Cities since it first debuted. It is everything I have wanted in a city builder. On my current play through I am doing my best to make my city as large as possible. The progression is right on pace and controls do what you expect them to do. There is always a need to expand but you can micro manage to your hearts content ... or not.  

The mod support adds so much to the experience that is can become a new game. The disasters can come at THE WORST times but it honestly adds to the experience."
18477,Awesome community and very fun
18478,"Just plain addictive, what a game!"
18479,
18480,"if your mad for traffic management and love city building then this the one 
there are thousands of ways to build your city there are some great mods, maps and props to download and not forgetting the scenarios can't really find any faults just a few glitches with mods but they are soon sorted
all in all 10 out of 10 fab fun"
18481,"this game would probably seem super boring from the outside to someone who has never played, but it is extremely addicting. i can play for hours on end, sometimes up to 7 hours a day if i have the time. i've picked this game back up recently and wow, it is addicting. i've been playing it non-stop. i'm still just a beginner builder, but it's a good idea to look up some tutorials on youtube for the basics such as road hierarchy and road efficiency, zoning and districts, water/ferry stuff and etc. youtube is your best resource. i would recommend some essential mods to help you out that don't seem too non-vanilla, like the ""move it"" mod or  ""fine road anarchy"". under the ""City Planner Plays Top 20 Mods 2021"" post, you can subscribe to all the best and (how i consider them) essential mods after you've played for a good amount of time and understand the mechanics."
18482,At home i am not in charge.  In this game ... I AM GOD!
18483,its a good game
18484,Pretty decent city planner game.  Goes into a lot of detail even without the DLCs compared to other games.
18485,"I have tried this game because I hear it's better than SimCity. It's not.
If you want to play it, you will need DLC's and many mods for various aspects of game.
I would say, unfinished game full of bugs and platform for DLC sale."
18486,During the Covid-19 pandemic lock downs I have swapped my daily frustration of hours stuck in traffic commuting to the office with the daily frustration of trying to resolve my city's traffic problems!
18487,nice
18488,The mod community is what really brings your cities building experience to the next level.
18489,Good Game!
18490,"Superbly made without a doubt. Its technically very good, considering such a small team. It just all fits together, very polished. You can, eh, build cities. That's about it. The goal is I guess to have a large city and unlock big things like airfields and statues and unique buildings etc - while keeping the living areas free of pollution and all citizens happy. Once you done that, the game is kinda over, but I guess one could look at the expansion packs for more challenge. Or just keep crafting and crafting, if you're a real sandboxer. Anyway, worth a shot if you're curious about building cities. It's very noob-friendly. No manuals or internet-tutorials needed."

18501,"There's not very much to say about this game. If you have SimCity nostalgia or just maybe like the idea of playing with a city building simulator, you'll probably have a good time with Cities: Skylines. The Steam Workshop has a ton of fun mods and assets to add on top of all the official DLC and Content Packs and I only really wish I personally knew how to make better use of them."
18502,">Think of new idea for a city
>Start a new game
>Log on to Cities: Skylines
>Quit before finishing
>Think of another idea for a city
>Start a new game

The Cycle continues"
18503,"Fun city builder with a robust community that constantly adds new workshop items to add spice to the base game. You'll probably have to buy a few of the DLC to get the most out of it as they do add quite a bit of fun to the game and new maps to play on.

Pros:
Pretty forgiving if you're like me and refuse to play in sandbox mod. The money and unlocks are paced really well from start to finish and once you get your industry zones up and running you can easily revisit the older areas and redo them how you like.

Green options and rewards! It's neat they included this but also their drawbacks. You still need to balance things in order to have a thriving economy which I quite enjoyed. Lot's of ways to handle pollution and traffic, just takes time and attention.

Cons:
Public transit is VERY tedious to setup with you having to manually assign every bus route. I wish they just let you pop down a bus stop and let the AI determine the best routes but I imagine most people might actually see this as a win. I just can't be bothered to connect my city fully.

Natural disasters are very easy to recover from. Not much that can really stop you steam rolling things.

Need for tons of schools and other public utilities. This isn't a huge thing but it does take up valuable real estate. Once you get to high density zoning, you typically have to have schools and what not so packed in because of how it determines the coverage areas. Unless you have a ton of side streets woven amongst your high density areas (sometimes that don't even help) you end up building 10 schools within a single screen so your capacity is way higher than those that are using stuff.

Overall, well worth the money and it keeps me coming back again and again."
18504,If you like SimCity 4 you need to get this game ASAP
18505,
18506,better than sim city
18507,Imagine releasing a city builder and then requiring your entire fanbase to buy 18 $20+ DLC packs just for the game to be moderately entertaining and have content. Jewish hacks made this game.

18525,"The short version is that this is the ultimate city builder. Let's start with the flaws though.

Too few settings for graphics and audio, but then I'm nitpicking because I can't find enough flaws. The worst part is the secondary launcher thing, yes, another launcher, yay.

The last problem is the roads are sometimes a pain to build, they often just don't want to work right leading to some wonky looking messes. Stick with it though, and you can make some fun tracks.

Now to the good parts, the game is unforgiving, if you mess up your whole city dies. I love this, normally I'd complain about not having difficulty tweaks but the balance is almost perfect and you have mods if you want a less than vanilla game.

My only feature request would be having the ability to go into the city. Like allow you to become a person, or follow a car in first person like some transport games do. If you liked SimCity, you'll love absolutely City Skylines."
18526,I enjoy
18527,Every misclick will cost you hundreds if not thousands of dollars.
18528,7/10
18529,cities good
18530,Great Game
18531,"Garbage game man. No matter how hard you try. garbage garbage garbage. Yeah the game is trash, but that's the main problem no matter what. docent matter HOW MANY LANDFILLS OR WHAT EVER YOU BUILD. trash is the only problem. should be called trash sim bec thats all you deal with is trash. Sorta fucking dumb. i put 9 landfills and like 20 incinerator on a map. garbage still piling up. So whats the fucking solution?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!!?!?!!?!?!?! I HATE I SPENT MONEY ON THIS GAME SHOULD BE CALLED TRASH SKYLINES, OR MAYBE GARBAGE SIM BEC THAT IS ALL YOU WILL DEAL WITH."
18532,ghtffffff
18533,Very in-depth city building with a ton of fun mechanics and customization options.

18540,Huge fan! Lovely city builder game
18541,Best game
18542,One of the Best City Building
18543,Nice game but it takes a few hours to understand well how to use the resources.
18544,As far as City builders go I place this as my second favourite. The game is a 7.5/10
18545,very fun. dlc's are good too. wish some came with the game though
18546,I like this game cause you can be as creative as you want with your city. Although im not too smart so i wish they would add a mode where the ppl dont complain as much.
18547,"A great sandbox game that help kills the time. You will never be perfect, but you will going to learn from trials and errors"
18548,"This now requires the Paradox Launcher, which isn't disclosed on the store page and is forced onto your PC if you want to play the game.

0/10.  Do not support bad business practices; do not buy this game.  Get NewCity instead."
18549,Best city builder ever! Highly addictive
18550,best sandbox game which will help you unlock your imagination
18551,"A city painter full of bugs. If the solution to ever bug is download a mod, it's a NO from me."
18552,Well whaddaya know!  Putting the city dump in a residential neighborhood does drive the property values down.  My dad was right!
18553,Everything is good
18554,Its just a fun game
18555,equal parts ant farm and excel spreadsheet. excellent
18556,"I haven't use it because it crash or problems. I don't know what's going on?
"
18557,Grids. Grids everywhere.
18558,"This game is amazing. I love it, first time to I can say how I am a mayor :D"
18559,yes
18560,ye
18561,Game stopped working after a short while.  Uninstall/Reinstall does not help getting the game working.
18562,if you want it you'll like it
18563,Not made by EA 10/10
18564,i'm to lazy for a desc.
18565,Is this a good game? Hell yeah brother
18566,"Let your imagination fly
"
18567,BEST GAME EVER
18568,"The game is fun and really good, but have some things to fix.
First of all need to optimize ram and graphics. It's quite upsetting how fast the computer fans go to full speed trying to refrigerate the computer and the game only runs smoothly with a 30,000 population. This also occurs when you add some mods and DLCs - really needed because the base game have many unrealistic building things.
Also the graphics are the worst thing. It looks like 2005. With all the resources it waste, it should be far more better.
Is a game whit a good base and potentially the best of its genre but needs urgently a new version.
CS 2, now!"
18569,It's fun But a tad bit lagy thats just my computer
18570,One of the best city building simulation game.
18571,"Current benchmark for city-building and detailing games and a hidden gem in traffic/transit management, though compared to the city building aspect the latter is slightly lacking in the granular detail and ease of control.

Never the less, it's an awesome time waster that I always find myself staying up late for."
18572,very gud but too many dlcs
18573,poop volcano.
18574,"Great game, but some mods are a must have for long term sanity. Traffic Manager, PE. Fine Road tools. Fine Road anarchy. Loading Screen mod. Check out YUMBLtv's mid collection in the workshop for more."
18575,i get to muder people
18576,Financial Bankruptcy Speedrun Any%.
18577,Wish I could have more than 9 blocks
18578,"8 out of 10. quite a game for city building genre. missing some crucial features especially the financial e.g. the adjustments of taxes, funding of expenses are too generic, the DLCs have very few features to add to the main game. has quite  number of issues. One is the annoying Index array out of range."
18579,ก้าวแรกไม่เป็นไร ก้าวต่อไปรถเริ่มติด
18580,"Kill 500,000 people with toxic waste.


Good Game"
18581,Great Game!
18582,"Buy Cities: Skylines Collection DISCOUNT! -9% Your Price: $193.55

18583,THE GAME GIVE ME HPPINESS :)

18585,No.
18586,being mayor has never been more fun
18587,Awesome city building experience! You too can make the world a better place!

-There's a traffic creating
-Spend 5 hours trying to fix it 
-You can't 
-You cry
-START A NEW CITY"
18589,"Great game i have a lot of fun playing it, it adds more with mods which is fun."
18590,"Of the simulator games I've played, this one holds up really nicely over the years, and it has a plethora of mod support. This game runs on an average PC/laptop, but will struggle with no GPU. It's possible to run with just integrated graphics, but can be hard to run with larger and larger cities. Any city with pop over 150,000 gets basically unplayable from my experiences.

18593,cock and balls
18594,Great game
18595,Literally the best city building/management game on the market right now. It also has tonnes of amazing mods made by the community too. So once you're bored of vanilla get modding friends trust me its worth it!
18596,"Super fun game! After awhile, you do lose track of time lol."
18597,"Very fun, 10/10"
18598,Mantap gamenya
18599,"Fun builder but terrible technical execution. The game is chock full of bugs that have never been fixed (you can find plenty of help in forums going back many years) because they are too busy making DLCs to sell you rather than making sure the base UI actually functions consistently. If you are new to this game, you will need those forums too, since the in-game help/tooltips are vague and unhelpful - even though they popup and clutter your screen constantly. Would be a really fun game if it were designed for usability and if they would fix bugs."
18600,"good game
"
18601,"I've spent many hours in this game, first on my Xbox, and then when I pretty much got a PC so I could mod it. This game really allows me to use my creativity as building cities is one of my most passionate and creative outlets."
18602,"I've sunk WAYYY too many hours into this game, its so satisfying to watch your city grow and then the eventual other cities you build"
18603,"hello i need to get a loan 
what for?
tolls."

18605,"This game has gotten EXTREMELY buggy, it is starting to remind me of Windows 95 - you have moved your mouse, system needs to restart!  The load times (without any assets/mods/etc) takes FOREVER.  Switching from anything (editor, map, etc) to another causes  the Main Menu to become unresponsive - you cannot even exit (must use Task Manager to KILL the process).  I would think having all these Youtubers now on the payroll might be a mistake - money better spent would be to improve the code."
18606,Nice way to torture my citizens
18607,Easy but grasping little game.

18611,The AI is good as well as the graphics. Very enjoyable but slightly stressful at times.
18612,After recent updates game does not start anymore.  They did it.
18613,"Great game to get lost in, the hours just fly by watching my cities grow."
18614,I built the worst cities ever but that won't ever stop me from getting an addicition to this game once every two months then stop playing it just for the cycle to repeat
18615,it's a fun city builder but it's a much better deal on sale
18616,Best city builder out at the moment
18617,This game is fun! I recommend this game.

18647,Very fun relaxing game.
18648,Amazing game. Great for casual players.
18649,Its entertaining and a little challenging but from what I seen so far the AI and physics engine need common sense installed :). It's a game of course but the water flows funny and the NPCs do strange things.
18650,"I actually love this game a lot, one time I accidently made a bad dam and my entire city is flooding. No regret though."
18651,"Best game EVER! With all the WORKSHOP content, you can do anything you want! I came from SimCity4 and thought that modded content was awesome, that's nothing compared to Cities Skylines! No matter what, I always return to the game. It's so easy to play for long periods and take breaks when needed and just pick it back up. Can't say enough great things about it!"
18652,"An absolutely fantastic game. An endless amount of depth and replayability, especially with mods!"
18653,The game is very enjoyable. Highly re-playable. Your ideas get better the more you play.
18654,"Before you buy this game .Be sure to see all DLC.
Everything is at the DLC you need to pay more for DLC then the game.
Vannila game is unplayable booooring crapp.
This is a svindle ,thugs that pray on kids and hide behind a pay wall of endless DLCs."

18674,big city go brrrrrrrrrrr then game crash
18675,"A very nice and relaxing city builder. One of the best city sims out there that I have played. What you want to do in the game is basically up to you and is endless as well. There are also a ton of mod options and what seems to be endless choices from maps to props, to cars, to industries, you name it and the modding community seems to help keep this game going strong. I would totally recommend if you just want a relaxing game and chill experience."
18676,Great city building game. A ton of customization and detail to dig into but requires a decent bit of mods/community content to fully flesh out. Easily recommend to anyone who likes this type of thing.
18677,aa
18678,"THIS GAME IS AMAZING!!! You will always have something to do (usually mess with traffic problems) and mods make it all the better! I can play this game for hours on end and never get board! The cherry on top is the unique buildings and monuments, which add just a little more of a challenge for those who are looking for it. The only problem is that some older computers have trouble running it well, but the benefits outweigh the conflicts BY FAR. If you like games that never end, just to take your mind off of things, THIS GAME IS FOR YOU! If you like city-builders, THIS GAME IS FOR YOU! If you are into maps, THIS GAME IS ALSO FOR YOU! If it's too expensive, just wait for a sale to come around (they aren't uncommon) and buy it at a discounted price! I know I sound like a commercial, but this game gets a 17/10 from me!"
18679,"It's decent... you can enjoy it without the dlc for quite a while, but if you want the dlc try to wait for a steam sale because honestly not worth it."
18680,"Hehe, make city, KILL CITY."

18686,fun
18687,"Creative Assembly need to make this into their next Total War. 

Absolutely would recommend."
18688,"This is a fun game, but the programming, it doesn't always do what you want it to do. There is a lack of utility and options in the base game that can make gameplay tedious and frustrating. So I can only recommend this game if you are modding it as well. Thankfully there is a mod page supported by steam that makes it easy to add your favorite mods."
18689,"Excellent city building sim. This is what Sim City was supposed to be about 10 years ago. With CS, you also get wide community support for creating custom assets and mods to enhance the game. Only downside to the game is you have to be weary of what mods you install because some are old and no longer supported and will crash your game. If the mods are still supported, then there are very few issues with game stability. 9/10"
18690,Made a city in the shape of a middle finger then flooded the city with shit 4/5( could have named the pollution collectors shit tornadoes instead).

18695,11/10 Just buy it
18696,Probably the best city builder imo since its release.
18697,"Not my cup of tea.

Put off by a horrible front end spammed with plugs for DLC etc.  And yes, I would like a spoon-feedy tutorial available from in-game menu.  I do not want to have to go rummaging in the Discussions and feretting off-site material.

I can see why other people would like this and I was hoping for something I would enjoy like Banished, Planetbase, Life is Feudal: Forest Village, or hell, even Tropico.  But this isn't it."
18698,I have always loved city builds.  Unlike some games there is no wild disasters to destroy one's builds. Although I tore down my damn because I couldn't make it work and the ensuing tsunami was an interesting set back!
18699,city
18700,Its okay I guess....
18701,Good city building game.
18702,"I wish there was a neutral thing I could click. I don't hate this game, but I don't love it either. It's a better version of Simcity but has many issues, including a harder learning curve. I enjoyed it for awhile but got kind of frustrated and bored and gave up."
18703,:D
18704,good game when bored lol

18706,roads.
18707,"this game is as great as your imagination.  Paradox, Colossal team has done a great job on bringing to us a fabulous game that scales very well.  lots of thought went into every element: the traffic lights, the plumbing, the music.  I enjoyed this game and have purchased it on multiple platforms."
18708,it's fun...
18709,you like to make your city ; this game has it all or is on steam too download ' have fun its a good game.
18710,one of the best game play ever if you like simulation game
18711,hours will go by with this game
18712,"Very Fun, Game never gets boring."
18713,"Cool City builder :)
"
18714,great
18715,"This game has so much effort put in it. The management of your money, of your City of the energy, etc. It's just so precise. You have to pay max attention to everything. Then there's the ""sandbox"", with infinite money. That's where you can go crazy with your creative cities, natural disasters, if you own the dlc and even making dumb stuff like the ""pollution city I did"", or the ""shitdam of Springfield"". The game is really well done. Recommend to everyone who has some spare money"

18724,I came
18725,nice game
18726,Very good way to pass the time especially with music in the backgrounf
18727,best city builder on the market
18728,make a town. take away their rights.
18729,Best city building simulation with many custom assets & mods for realistic design.
18730,"great game, some DLCs should be in base game though"
18731,the best game so far
18732,pretty gud game
18733,Buy this game thinking you want to make your dream town only to give up and make a poo volcano like the rest of us
18734,"I mean, it's a good game"
18735,Please fix your game.
18736,.
18737,"Endless hours of fun, if you can deal with the paradox business model of endless expansions"
18738,fck yes i recommend this game
18739,me like
18740,You can pretty much do anything in the game and it is amazing how detailed this game is.
18741,"Nice and fun to relax to, and that City youve been working on for three or four years? yeah, burn it down."
18742,I love this game. Because I like to turn New Mexico Small Towns into Big Cities.
18743,"es mi juego favorito mpor mucho, al comenzar partida puede ser algo tediosos, pero ya cuando le coges el tiro puedes pasar horas jungado si darte cuenta, excelente juego."
18744,"Its the best most presios Most buitiful most crazy most insane most awesome most Best Game of games in the us in the world in the solar system in the univers in the marble in the handfull of other marbles of a sack of an alien that all aliens have that are awesome and super cool
and crazy and awesome"
18745,i liek game
18746,yes
18747,Best city building game ever!  Knocks the new SimCity out of the park.
18748,"As a long time SimCity player from back at the start, this is the game to turn to for a modern city building experience. Certain of the DLC I would consider required to truly get the most out of the game, but from vanilla to fully stocked this is a terrific game that challenges and rewards. Just keep the poop out of the drinking water, and have fun."
18749,Very interesting
18750,"-Make city
-City works
-Too much traffic
-Make wider roads
-Doesn't help
-Cry
-Burn city to the ground
-Feel better"
18751,"Great, enjoyable game"
18752,"It is very fun and I usually sink a couple hours at a time then forget about it for a couple of months. It can get a little complicated and frustrating, but it is still enjoyable for me (as someone with very limited understanding of urban planning)"
18753,am i gay
18754,Relaxing game.
18755,cool
18756,Lovely game
18757,best citybuilder i know of
18758,its a good game
18759,Very detail city management game.
18760,this game is absolutely amazing
18761,"its a good game
"
18762,"I love the detail and the opportunity to build cities with so many tool, such as, trains, monorails, subways , airports and ports.  There are also a lot of helpful YouTube videos."
18763,"A good game to play when you're bored. Although, there are a lot of game-breaking glitches that I have encountered every time I've played. Like one glitch where workers never come to work even with a good population and educated citizens and other where after a bit of time the whole population begins to die and it becomes very overwhelming. I think the second glitch has to due with the elderly age group of your city starting to die but it can ruin even the biggest most well thought out towns."
18764,I absolutely love this game! If you like city builders and have lots of time and creativity this ones for you! There's so much inspiration on youtube too!
18765,Love this game
18766,
18767,Having a great time and learning new things everyday. I like that you can play vanilla or go with as many mods as your pc will handle. Youtube is a fountain of knowledge even its difficult to find exactly what you want there. Biffa and all the other content creators really do there best to help you progress in the game.   I am not really into discords and such but I do know there are some incredible people playing this game. I am just a little fish in a huge pond. I am ok with that.  The only down side I have come across is lots of broken assets in the workshop. I do wish it would be cleaned up once and a while. It is sad when you find a awesome asset and either it wont load or when you place it will not operate correctly. Other then that I give this game a 10 its just what I need after a long week.
18768,just love it
18769,"Ah yes, building a city."
18770,"One of the best city simulation games ever. The game itself is great and the DLCs are solid too for the most part. However, what truly makes this game special is the modding community behind it - they can completely transform this game with tonnes of assets and maps, as well as mods which improve the player experience. Buy this - wait for a sale if you want but it is 100% worth full cost as well. 10/10"
18771,this game just DO be fun tho
18772,"The very best city builder game there is, hands down."
18773,"Endless potential for creativity and expression. One of the best, if not the best, gaming communities you'll find. Great people who dedicate so much of their free time to helping and sharing with others. No other community like it. Skylines has the best, most versatile platform for city building. Fantastic fun!!"
18774,"Amazing open-minded game, always able to broadcast your imagination in so many different ways and with endless creativity and inspiration it's just purely amazing. I have had this game for 3 years and over that spent almost 1,000 hours endlessly expanding my imagination to create metropolitan areas or rural villages with much detail."
18775,6/5
18776,Fun game
18777,epic but kinda buggy
18778,dshjufgghjgfsad city make good
18779,Best city simulator game
18780,My favourite game all the time.
18781,"A fun game until your traffic stuck for weeks.
10/10 will make roads again"
18782,fun interesting gmaeplay
18783,80% Traffic Simulator but it's pretty and fun :)
18784,"£150+ for the complete game ... lol.

( d.l.c. )"
18785,Awesome
18786,Old but gold.
18787,best city building ever!
18788,I think my favorite thing about this game is that you will never get the same outcome no matter how many times you try. and the ability to customize with DLCs and in the workshop is fantastic.
18789,IT has taken me away from things that i don't know how to do to be able to build a city it is awesome game lots of fun
18790,good game. but everything is locked behind DLC!
18791,"Fantastic game!! 
9/10"
18792,city go brrrrrrr
18793,"Solid game -easy to understand - hard to master (especially clearing up traffic)
A *HUGE*, like, *EXTREAMLY HUGEEEE* dowqnsite is, that without the DLC's, the game is boring as heck, half the content is DLC.
It's over 200€/$ to buy all of it. The base game is only about 1/3 the content and 1/5 the depth.
Wanna help traffic out with mass transportation? 20€ more for a DLC to allow you to do that in any ammount of time, plus 20€  on top of that if you don't want trucks everywhere in your city, but hey, atleast you can then have 3x more traffic in industrial zones, and an added Douseptillon times the complexity.

Everything in this game takes time, and a lot of it. If you want to build a new district, you will have to practically delete your public transport system and re-draw it, because the station-move tool is absolute garbage.

TL:DR: Too many DLC's, features of the base game not worked out"
18794,"It is very fun to play .It has got buses, trolley buses, planes,helicopters,trains,metro trains,  I haven't found a bad bug yet. Worth the money."
18795,Good Game
18796,Yeah pretty good I guess.
18797,Best city builder ever!
18798,Best City Building Game EVER!
18799,"build road, make small town.
build more road, make big city 
"
18800,This shit is bussin'. Respectfully.
18801,Surely one of the best transport games ever! Prettier than Transport Tycoon and more intricate.
18802,"I really enjoy this game. Adding a high speed rail mod makes watching trains go by quite fun,
"
18803,Very good game realistic my favourite game I have
18804,awesome game - easily one of my top5 game ever played
18805,"[h1]Fun game that you can spend hundreds of hours on[/h1]

Pros:
- Really fun game
- You can get many hours to go with playing
- Good graphics
- Fills nothing (only 4gb)
- The game guides one well through the various things

Cons:
- There is no multiplayer
- You have to buy a lot as DLCs, which makes the game a lot more expensive than what you first assume
- The game does not explain what the reason why you suddenly lose a lot of money

Graphics:
- The graphics are good. It is not realistic, but has its own style. The graphics have their own style and it is implemented throughout the game. From when you zoom out and see the whole city and to when you zoom in and follow a person's walk through your city. The only place where the graphics seem old is the menus

You need to know before buying:
- You have to buy a lot like DLC

Conclusion:
The game is for you who love a casual game. The game does not require as much of you and play, but brings many hours of fun. You do not get tired of the game as you keep unlocking new things that make the game more fun. In addition to this, you also unlock more soil that you can build on. The game is overall extremely well executed and therefore makes it a little extra fun to play. I would think that the game is worth 28 € if you love this kind of game (If you like Planet Coster you would also like this game). However, I would say that if you just wanted to try the game and do not know if you would spend many hours on I would wait until it is available on offer for 15 € approx"
18806,i blew up a whole city with a rock yay
18807,"This Game is highley adicting and Fun, With the help of Mods you can never run out of ideas"
18808,i liked it
18809,remember how much fun as kids we could have with those rugs that look like streets? well i've started to feel that same feeling again with this game and it's priceless.
18810,10/10
18811,love it
18812,i love the
18813,a
18814,Traffic congestion on mainstreet someone send help
18815,Very fun
18816,best city building game
18817,"Fun game, good way to kill a Sunday, and very cool to just let your city exist on work on it's own"
18818,its such a good game that I dont contact my family because im playing this game
18819,"I have 270 hours in steam at the time of writing this review. This does not include the 600 hours on my other steam account (where i actually first owned this game) Before finally picking up the game and all its DLC for less than the base game on steam from elsewhere.

100% recommend this game if you want a good Sim City like experience, you do not need all the DLC if you dont want or cant afford them, but there are some essentials like Mass Transit. This game is great because of steam and mods, there are so many mods its unreal, for anything you can imagine. I have 90 mods and 3700 assets, from parks to car parks and new roads and better city management and road manipulation tools.

Fun with or without mods, better with mods."
18820,THIS IS GOOD GAME!!!
18821,better than simcity
18822,building go tink tink
18823,"gud
"
18824,I'm surprised I haven't recommended this game. Hell yes !
18825,Pretty good
18826,yes
18827,yes
18828,"Generally I have been enjoying the game a lot. Although, there are some minor things that can be improved, such as public transit management, ability to implement mixed-use zoning and, to me in particular, it feels like the basic two lane, two way road with bicycle lane should be included in the base game."
18829,"Even with just the base game, this is really fun for many hours. Can't complain at all, for the price. It's a well thought-out city builder with tons of stuff to do and nice graphics. Recommend buy."
18830,pretty good game 8.5/10
18831,hehe poopoo hole
18832,please play
18833,Best Game!! Definitely worth it!!
18834,Great game !! Better than sim city !! I really recommend it !!!

18844,"awesome game
heaps of fun and easy"
18845,its a great game for what it advertised its a strategic planning city building game with stunning visuals and a fun motive to make the largest and unique city's possible.
18846,"I like building cities and then launching fireballs at them and closing the game, hours later, without saving.  #YOLO"
18847,:D
18848,Love this game.
18849,👍
18850,Hope there'll be official multiplayer one day.
18851,i very like City: skylines
18852,Nice SimCity remake
18853,"this is an amazingly made city builder full of little quirks and mechanics you can learn and use to improve your city, and well made DLC for stuff like natural disasters, green cities and much more.
But the thing you should be interested in is the modding community, with thousands of well made cities and custom props like Godzilla and other decorative monsters, as well as mods galore for things like first person, giant tsunamis and other interesting features, you will be occupied for days on end with this little city builder. so i would rate this game an 9/10 just because of some performance issues for lowish end PCs and laptops or that could just be me and if so it's a 10 from me folks."
18854,"when u bored clikk the game
"
18855,"Wonderful sim, but gets old fast if you haven't got any of the x-pacs. Fortunately the modding community is still alive and strong for this 6-year-old game, which really really helps to keep the game fresh. Gorgeous graphics, relaxing sound design, and is really the ultimate sandbox simulation game that also requires engineering skills and accuracy."
18856,"this terrific game is developed for everything about city building.
if you searching a good flavour and fun, you can take this game."
18857,it's good
18858,"Great strategy game, really fun, good mechanics, but i always lead my city slowly into doom. Truly an amazing and complex game."
18859,fun
18860,"I grew up on SimCity, starting with the original game back in the early 90's and then on to SC 2000, SC 3000, SimCity 4, and the recent SimCity reboot. And I can honestly say without a doubt that this game is way better than any of them. If you enjoy city builders then you have to try Cities: Skylines and all of its DLCs! But I must warn you, it's highly addictive!!"
18861,You know what's up
18862,"Nice game, i like every single detail of this game."
18863,156 hours..  after years... best time killer game i ever played
18864,Super fun and addicting!
18865,beautiful
18866,I really enjoy being able to watch a city grow and progress.  Being able to detail the landscape and the look of the city you make is really enjoyable and compelling.  Reaching new goals and opening up more options for your city is fun.  Just be careful because time will absolutely evaporate playing this game!
18867,9.8/10
18868,good gem
18869,"Very very fun game, you can do many things including making a city and making sure that city has the basic needs for people to live in it."
18870,Engrossing gameplay that lets you make your world exactly what you want it to be. :)
18871,NO
18872,yes good fun
18873,"Cities Skylines has successfully stolen my soul. I highly recommend playing with mods, but dont go to crazy with it at first."
18874,great city game
18875,I too love destroying the lives of thousands of citizens
18876,"played on the xbox one as well as here and is simply phenomenal. great mod support, great core gameplay, great city building, great strategy management, etc. worth the price 100%"
18877,City Building .
18878,"Cities Skylines is an accurate representation of what it would be like to build a city. You can build all different types of roads in all different categories, zone areas for building types (industry, residential, commercial, etc.) and create districts to have the zoned areas be unique. Also you can change the types of industry, and there's unique building and parks to build as well with the community's mods."
18879,"make successful city
get blown up by meteor 
cry"
18880,.
18881,"City Skylines needs to get politics out of its game with its 'chirpy' bird that constantly makes comments. For instance, the game promotes 'universal healthcare', and suggests that anyone who does not believe in the fake science of 'climate change' is a 'denier'. I don't appreciate the game making a city traffic simulator into a political mouthpiece. The game didn't start off that way; the 'chirpy' comments have gotten more obscene."
18882,"Best city building simulator out there
10/10"
18883,Most enjoyable game with amazing graphics
18884,"The best city building game so far - and I say that as a Sim City 4 fanatic. City management as well as city building. Just as fun to build and nurture small communities as big cities. This game is most rewarding as a long-term investment rather than a quick fix: it takes time to understand what everything does, to read the tooltips and to learn what you can get from the UI, but when you get a city to work well and develop organically, it's immensely satisfying. Really good modding community but the base game is already excellent. Even better again with the DLCs, which enrich city dynamics and increase your options, and are mostly worth it if you can afford them. Supported by some excellent YouTubers if you need inspiration to design your city. Visually still looks good in 2021 if you have a decent computer, and mods can enhance the visuals further."
18885,:D
18886,AMAZING GAME!!!! SO DETAIL YET COMPLICATED BUT STILL FUN! VERY RECOMMENDED!
18887,it's good for once in a while
18888,Lots of possibilities.
18889,it's poggers
18890,amongtastic! definitely made me act a bit sus 9.2/10
18891,It's a good city building game. Very realistic.

18895,goood
18896,dfgdgddryryryryyrydr
18897,Nice game
18898,I love this game
18899,thumbs up
18900,"1In the beginning God created the heavens and the earth. 2Now the earth was formless and empty, darkness was over the surface of the deep, and the Spirit of God was hovering over the waters.

3And God said, “Let there be light,” and there was light. 4God saw that the light was good, and he separated the light from the darkness. 5God called the light “day,” and the darkness he called “night.” And there was evening, and there was morning—the first day."
18901,"I have not played any other city builders, but this is probably the best one. It's addictive and has SO SO much content if you have some of the DLCS and is still good without any,
But not too good. I'm a little unhappy because so many of the features are payed for, But it's still a fantastic game regardless. Overall, 8/10."
18902,yes
18903,"I've had this game from near the very beginning when it launched. When it first launched I found it wanting a lot of the features you could find in Simcity and I fell in and out of playing it after awhile. I always kept up with the DLCs when they released, and just about every aspect that I found wanting either the DLCs or Mods have taken care of. This is now a very well rounded City Builder that you can sink hours into playing and look at the clock in joyful horror at how much time you just put into your city to make it perfect.

If you like city builders, this game is now IMHO the standard bearer for the genre, and you cant go wrong picking this title up and i recommend highly the DLCs that it has as well."
18904,"Fun game, no comment needed"
18905,yes
18906,Best city builder ever

18915,THE BEST GAME OH SHEESH
18916,Very detailed and fun
18917,Great
18918,great game with a huge amount of mods
18919,it's the best game that runs like ass on any PC
18920,نىنبىنية
18921,Incredible game
18922,"I've spent almost 700 hours played in this game. Dare I say Cities Skylines is very interesting game where you can build a city you want, observe how it grows, make everything with your masterpiece. If you have a powerful PC or a laptop you can install a plenty of mods and build a city in European, American or Asian style. So, I recommend this game for everyone who loves city-building simulators! 9/10."
18923,Nice game
18924,super good
18925,"after a long time, problems start appearing for seemingly no reason even if you have managed everything completely fine. begins being a cat and mouse game and isn't rewarding at all for someone who actually planned things from the beginning and had every aspect of every area in the green. suddenly trash will pile up and the dead won't be taken away even though you have more than enough landfills and hearses. seems like instead of the game actually getting harder later on and having more to do, they just choose things at random to start failing."
18926,10/10 pulling your hair out has never been more fun
18927,"This game was a very nice transition from sims city 3000 unlimited, its a huge step up from that and made me enjoy building cities"
18928,"Never ending fun
"
18929,since no one read review. im a big nerd. pls dont bully :(
18930,"fun, dlcs are too expensive tho"
18931,Never has planning ring-roads and gentrifying working class neighbourhoods been so fun!
18932,mods are so nice
18933,"Pros: 
Most cons can be overcome with mods, and the core of this game is outstanding. As such, this list is very long so I'll leave it at that. But...

Weaknesses:

- Poor utilization of CPU. This means that no amount of upgrading your rig can really increase the size of city you can feasibly run. Planet Coaster and Parkitect have the same problem.

- If you have multiple monitors, you need a 3rd party program such as CursorLock to lock your mouse to the game window. There isn't an in-game option, like Civ 5 has for example.

- Even with mods, economy and commute mechanics are somewhat simplistic. There isn't really a way to add in any more depth. You can only tweak the raw difficulty. Commute has no impact on happiness; only efficiency.

- Even with the 81-tile mod, you cannot make a city that resembles the size of real-life cities. Maximum size feels huge, but in reality it is only 18 x 18 kms and most real cities are larger than that. 

- The game engine only tracks about 65000 citizens. Beyond that, it cheats and uses shortcuts, meaning that your city begins to only ""pseudo-grow"" once it starts to become the size of a city. This starts to feel a bit empty.

Between the CPU, space, and citizen number limit, the game does really start to feel technologically stifled, which is where a sequel in a better engine would do this game wonders!

Yes, I'm nitpicking, but that's the point. This is a fantastic game, but I wanted to share its limitations."
18934,Its okay
18935,Me always bankrupt lol
18936,Yes i would recommend it. Its probably one of the best city building games out there and can be hard but fun.
18937,9/11 :flushed:
18938,"Very complete, intuitive to design and fun to play"
18939,"Its a good time killer
"
18940,"Fun Fun Fun, best city builder around"
18941,Better than SimCity... they did something right I think
18942,"godly city builder game

it gets really fun after you get the past the first hurdle of negative money when you have nothing but 2 blocks of residential zone"
18943,"Great game in which you can try to recreate the town you live in real life ,  only to have your sewage system screw you over and have shit go all over the place. 10/10"
18944,👍
18945,I don't play much as I'm not a very good player but seeing what people can do on it is amazing and I do recommend getting it. It is cool to build cities or other things that people choose to build.
18946,"This game is a great outlet for creative city planning and creating a city of your own. 
Either playing in vanilla or with the various mods, assets, and maps that the community have created, its a ball."
18947,"After 585 hours in this game, I have concluded that it is pretty good!"
18948,"This game, even without mods, is an amazing game."
18949,k8
18950,amazing
18951,"Excellent game, sunk almost a hundred hours into it."
18952,Too much high priced DLC. The base game is fun but lacking. Cheaper DLC or an honest priced package and I would change my rating.  I despise multi-hundred dollar games released in little bits.

18962,so addicted to this game
18963,NC bupati
18964,it messed up my pc
18965,Welp... game constantly crashes now. Tried re installing several times. It crashes right before the map is generated. Depressing to say the least because I loved this game
18966,Best city game available
18967,Civil engineering student's wet dream
18968,I am not fit to run a city
18969,The only thing I dislike about the game is all the time I've dropped into building cities. I actually look at the road systems around my city with a skeptical eye due to this game 10/10
18970,"This game has an insane amount of features and an absurd number of parallel systems, but it does such a good job of only giving you a few at a time that I never felt overwhelmed even when going in mostly blind."

Well hopefully I'll get bored soon enough but just the insane amount of mods.
Bought during summer sale, with a bit of DLC. Check the workshop first though before you buy any DLC. Some DLC are required for certain gameplay (bus hubs, eg), but a lot of Workshop material is golden. Spent 10 hours a day on it for the past week and a half. I've played no more than three cities.
I hate it. 
You can literally micromanage every little thing, especially with mods like President Mode traffic control here I have an entire city with every intersection with perfectly synchronized traffic lights. Special emergency services routes/lanes. Restricted left turn junctions. Separated truck and car toll booths. Seamless traffic wheels.
And I keep forgetting to buy food for myself irl.
I thought this was just a SimCity clone but it's a much, much improved and intense game."
18983,"this game doesn't suck, yippie"
18984,"Good, but sorely needs a Cities Skylines 2 to be released as it doesn't fully utilise current gen CPUs and GPUs..."
18985,do it
18986,City builder fun
18987,Super fun game! Great way to spend a couple hours.
18988,I like it
18989,"this game is great and all but for some reason whenever i play it for more than an hour the entire city just shuts down basically, all of the police don't go to the calls the trash trucks don't go out to pick up trash, and the firefighters just let the buildings burn to the ground. Its a very weird thing that's happened every time i play the game and there doesn't seem to be a way to fix it."
18990,Excellent game
18991,The guy she tells SimCity not to worry about
18992,yes
18993,city go brrrrrr
18994,"fun and easy to play - mods do help some, but easy enough vanilla. If you like build-it type games, then I recommend this"
18995,"Very good single playing game, probably the best city simulator. The only one close which i also own is ""rise of industry"".  Check them both out, both amazing games!"
18996,"La fondation de Montcuq remonte à l'époque gallo-romaine.

Au xiie siècle, c’était le chef-lieu d'une châtellenie. Vers 1224, Raymond VII, comte de Toulouse, donna une charte de coutumes8. Cette charte de coutumes nous est parvenue car elle était encadrée dans des lettres patentes de Louis XI, datées du 30 novembre 1463, mais qui n'est connue que grâce à une copie datée de 1606 comme l'indique une apostille : « Ce livre comprend 103 feuillets escripts par moy Parayre, du mandement d'Ant. Parayre, consul en l'an 1606 ». Il existe aussi une copie de cette charte provenant du Trésor des Chartes, édité dans les Ordonnances des rois de France de la Troisième race, 1814, t. XVI., p. 124-136 [archive].

Montcuq, à forte implantation cathare et vaudoise, et qui avait reçu sa charte de Raymond VI, prit tout naturellement le parti occitan. Le 1er juin 1212, Simon de Montfort s'empara de la place forte désertée par ses défenseurs et en fit don à Beaudouin, demi-frère du comte de Toulouse, rallié aux croisés.

Le 17 février 1214, sous le règne de son oncle Philippe-Auguste, Beaudouin comte de Toulouse se rendit au château de Lolmie (commune de Saint-Laurent-Lolmie, ruines du château xiiie siècle, au sud de Montcuq). Rallié à la cause albigeoise et cathare, après un bref combat, il fut arrêté par Ratier de Castelnau (pourtant allié de Montfort), Bertrand de Mondenard et le seigneur de Montpezat. Conduit à Montcuq et privé de nourriture, il refusa d'ordonner à ses soldats, enfermés dans le donjon de se rendre. La garnison française se rendit pourtant moyennant la vie sauve. Le chroniqueur assure qu'elle fut aussitôt massacrée. Beaudouin, emmené à Montauban, fut pendu sur ordre de son frère.

Après le traité de Meaux en 1229, le roi de France fit abattre les murs de la ville et le château, dont il ne reste que le donjon, gardé afin de prévenir d'éventuelles attaques ennemies. En effet, le donjon, point stratégique, offre un panorama intéressant sur la vallée de la Barguelonne de par sa hauteur.

Montcuq fut, au xive siècle, plusieurs fois reprise par les Anglais et, au xvie siècle, ravagée par les huguenots qui pillèrent le couvent des Cordeliers."
18997,"loved it, also very addicting with the high-rise buildings and disaster DLC's. just missing one thing, resturaunt and hotel services"
18998,Simply the best city builder ever created.
18999,"Its fun to mess around with the cities, and if you want to be a more serious player, there's ton of content for that as well (i would recommend getting the starter park, wait till a sale though)"
19000,lingaw sad baya..
19001,THIS IS JUST THE BEST
19002,i love the realism of the 3d environment.  countless hours spent designing the ultimate perfect city
19003,is jest a good game
19004,this is a great game to play if you like city builders but to play with mods you may need more than 8gbs of ram to load them
19005,Shows what my city could look like if it wasn't for a corrupt government
19006,The most comprehensive city builder with a fantastic mod community
19007,">be me
>scrolling through workshop
>saw bunch of assets
>download it
>load time increase to 5min now
>then forget about those assets"
19008,I can recommend it is easy to learn but there is still plenty to do though. Wait for discounts.
19009,yes
19010,Super Good
19011,GOOD GAME FOR CITY BUILDING
19012,"This shitty game wont let me log in for I don't know the fuck reason. REFUND, I might as get the cracked version instead. what a waste of money."
19013,i will always remember my 1st playthrough. I made a good city reached 10k population. Then suddenly my people became sick. i had not enough money to  get a hospital. people started dying and i dont have money to bury my dead in  a cemetery. And i annhilated the whole city in the upcoming 2 years. I love this game.
19014,Awesome Game!
19015,Fantastic Game ！Sometimes work and sometimes has a grave error！
19016,Just wanted to say I love this game and have logged over 200 hours on it. I also wanted to say that everyone of those hours was played on a machine with intel integrated graphics card. The game is sluggish but I love it
19017,"A bit difficult at the beginning, but got a hang of it."
19018,good game with DLC N' MODS
19019,It's amazing game ever....
19020,Nice game and graphic.
19021,I love the game!  It takes a second to figure out but deff worth the purchase and a time killer!
19022,"Super intricate and provides the ability to edit very small details. You can also just manage the city on a macro scale. Mods add extended functionality and buildings, giving the sim dozens of hours of gameplay."
19023,"Being able to be so creative with designing a city, as well as, dealing with the complexity of creating such a city with all the details and not just building.  The havoc that close along in a big city.  I wish the terraforming  was easier to perform when building roads near quays...My landscape keeps changing drastically."
19024,bought full price right after summer sale :)
19025,Built a good city. Almost drowned it thrice. Then drowned it :)
19026,very good to build your creativity skills

19039,It's a fun strategy building game
19040,"I love the mods so much, especially the natural disasters pack. I think you should add more mods, please and thank you"
19041,"My game keeps crashing, even without  mods! It loads and loads and nothing. 0/10."
19042,"play this game it very awesome and cool, suggest you buy the Natural Disasters pack as it helps boost the games chances of it not getting boring over time"
19043,"cool city builder and great modding community but this guy i know, michael kennith walker really sucks although this is unrelated to my review or this game"
19044,"31 hours of pure addicting fun. From making a poop volcano (RTGame), to putting a nuclear power plant next to a child care center, this game is all in all fun."
19045,it aight
19046,I wish I had a pause button on time so I could play this instead.
19047,Helps to understand how a city works and also is a therapeutic game unless you are on it.
19048,ITS PERFECT
19049,fun
19050,so fun once you start your own city
19051,it's pretty good
19052,its fun

19057,Steals information from players. Company collaborated with Epic Games. Slimy DLC practices; about $100 for basic DLCs.
19058,"After not having the best experience with a city simulator released in 2013, I'm enjoying Cities Skylines much more. The maps are expansive, and I don't feel like I'm playing a game of how long I can go before going bankrupt.

A much, much better city sim experience"

19067,"This is by far my favorite city-building game! I like that you're in charge of the macro level city planning, rather than the small minutia of designing every house and assigning every person a job and such that other games tend to get into. For someone that loves organization and efficiency, this game is absolutely perfect!"
19068,"The Best.

""Don't ever quote me""

19069,yes noice
19070,the graffics are insane
19071,Paradox would make roundabouts a 15€ DLC if they could.
19072,"A relaxing game that is amazing to spend some time, I totally enjoy it even without a single DLC."
19073,I would recommend this game as one of if not the best city building game available on the market today. I highly recommend picking up this game if you are interested. When you by this game I would highly recommend picking up some of the DLC to improve the game.
19074,"This game is strangely addictive, but there's a definite learning curve. Expect to spend some time on youtube and in the workshop downloading mods and assets to make it its most enjoyable."
19075,"Cities Skylines is a great and engaging Simulation game. 

Pros:

1. Realistic Simulation 
2. Once you got this playing, you cannot stop. Its very entertaining. 
3. Excellent Mod support
4. Have some good DLC and great support from Devs

Cons:

1. May experience some performance issues"
19076,"Best city building sim available currently. With mods, it becomes even better."
19077,Best city building game
19078,I've poured HOURS into this game! I have yet to get to get tired of this game!
19079,highly recommended cities: skylinnes for those who only like to play city building game. degree in urban planning sucks anyway cyka blyat
19080,"There's really nothing out there as accessible and as moddable as Cities: Skylines. For those reasons alone I'd suggest picking the game up. A few other reviewers have complained about the amount and the cost of DLC but considering how long the game has been out and continues to receive DLC, I'm fairly happy with it."
19081,"A quiet, chill, well crafted city builder."

19086,"I wasn't expecting this to be as addicting as it is, but I'm hooked. I imagine this will get even more addictive as I figure out how to make sure my cities are self-sustaining and well-flowing."
19087,90 hours fixing traffic jams :)))
19088,Easily one of the best games I have actually enjoyed for longer then a week at a time!

19097,Spent whole night analyzing traffic jams. 10/10 relax after work as a data analyst. Definitely recommend.
19098,"DLCs added additional maps, removed original ones. So, I can't start a new game. But I did pay full price for this game. Stay away from Paradox games. All of them. Unless you are willing to drop hundreds of dollars on DLCs. 
Also I'm pretty sure they sell user data to third parties and you can't exactly reject, kind of violating EU law?"
19099,"made like 2 roads and ran out of money LOL what a joke. not even properly playable as they keep shoveing dlc in your face too. frustrating experience all around took like 20 minutes loading in the map only to run out of money after 3 minutes. not even a reset button for when you make mistakes so instantly alt f4ed and uninstalled. play a good city builder so you know what you're missing.

edit: farmed the game for cards first so my playtime was inflated. wish i didn't so i could refund!!"
19100,its a great city builder but mostly a great building game if you play with mods and remove the limitations of the base game
19101,me like
19102,Good game

19104,great fun
19105,good
19106,Best city builder game. Simple as that.
19107,"This game is great for city building. The game seems to struggle during late game, but I've enjoyed many hours of fun playing the game."
19108,It's K
19109,"Really fun game, the dlc ads to the game aswell though could be a bit cheaper, enjoyable city sim over all"
19110,"This review is for the base game... not the DLCs. At its heart, the game is outlandishly simple, lacks challenge, and the core mechanics feel like they were whipped together in a weekend. With DLC, the game actually comes alive. The problem is, the DLC is literally them selling core game features that were clearly removed to be sold later. All the DLC weighs in at $200+.

Essentially the base game is little more than a barebones tech demo for Paradox to shovel the rest of the game at you for 8x the cost. 

As far as a simulation, it's mediocre. I would argue at this point that games like Tropico are better simulations of running a city than any of these 'city builder' games ever are. There's no election, no politics, crime is simply solved by dumping more police stations around (because that's how it works in real life, right?). 

The base game is simply unfinished. With all the DLC the game is fun (thus my hours played count) but it's not worth the pricetag unless you find a way to buy it all for practically nothing. You can't even play most major mods without the DLC at this point, either, so there's no relief that way."
19111,"I got $99 dollars and a city with like 99 problems

Gameplay: 8/10 can feel repetitive at times, but a fun core gameplay loop
Graphics: 5/10, Scalable but not much detail to anything, buildings can look very N64
Engine: 3/10 relies heavily on single core performance and it just gets worse and worse the bigger the city gets
Story: ??/10 make up your own type deal"
19112,"good
"
19113,"The best city builder on steam, DLCs can get a little expensive tho. However I would still buy it just because the game is so good
"
19114,The visuals are good. It's very pretty. The game progression is realistic. Bad decisions can haunt you for a long time but time and perserverance are great healers. Can play it for relaxation or frantically. Look on YourTube. Lot's to see.
19115,"Amazing game for city builders enthusiasts and for simulator likers. The base game (not talking about Vanilla) has really good content, but oh my god... The mods are where ALL THE FUN IS AT! Every mod adds a layer of complexity to an already super complex game. If you enjoy just relaxing and allowing yourself to space out a bit, just get this game now that it's on sale and all of the DLCs <3"
19116,great
19117,sick !!

19133,a great game to pass time
19134,Good.
19135,"its fun, but it literally asks you to have 100 gigs of ram if you want to play with any dlc or mods. if you arent running a pc hooked up to nasa then maybe play sim city instead. like seriously im not even joking about the ram requirement. hopefully cities skylines 2 actually can handle file management or something"
19136,Great Game!!
19137,"After just a days worth of playing this game, I can in fact confirm, it is the single greatest city sim in the history of ever. If you have even the slightest of interest in something like this, play it, you will love it. 

It is important to mention a couple of quarks though. Road construction can be very strange sometimes as well as zoning locations. Both of these can in fact be rather... funny at times."

19142,its cool
19143,"i can send asteroids to neighborhoods and kill everybody


i can also create shit mountain and have it spill out everywhere"
19144,"Best city builder game I've played hands down, good DLC over the years and great workshop content."
19145,"Things I can do in Cities: Skylines that I couldn't do in SimCity (5)

- Play without an internet connection
- Name my city something rude like PantyFlash
- Edit terrain in a nice map editor
- Play without logging into Origin
- Actually have simulated people whose actions make sense (Every person has their own name and a constant house where they live)
- Manage traffic properly
- Have fun

Pro:
+Very accessible to new players, but has enough depth to satisfy veterans of the genre
+Each citizen has a real life, simulated 24/7 to the point where you can follow everyone around to find exactly where they live and where they work.
+Huge cities with 36 square kilometer area for building, expandable through mods to 100 square kilometers
+Really catching, you can play for many hours at a time, deep into the night without stopping

Cons:
-Lack of depth in a few of the systems (wind and crime specifically)
-Dams are buggy, can cause massive unnatural flooding if they stop working correctly.
-Bigger cities can reduce performance
-Building styles are repetitive, often times 3 or more of the same store or house end up being built next to each other"

Its wings are too small to get
its fat little body off the ground.
The bee, of course, flies anyway
because bees don't care
what humans think is impossible.
Yellow, black. Yellow, black.
Yellow, black. Yellow, black.
Ooh, black and yellow!
Let's shake it up a little.
Barry! Breakfast is ready!
Ooming!
Hang on a second.
Hello?
- Barry?
- Adam?
- Oan you believe this is happening?
- I can't. I'll pick you up.
Looking sharp.
Use the stairs. Your father
paid good money for those.
Sorry. I'm excited.
Here's the graduate.
We're very proud of you, son.
A perfect report card, all B's.
Very proud.
Ma! I got a thing going here.
- You got lint on your fuzz.
- Ow! That's me!
- Wave to us! We'll be in row 118,000.
- Bye!
Barry, I told you,
stop flying in the house!
- Hey, Adam.
- Hey, Barry.
- Is that fuzz gel?
- A little. Special day, graduation.
Never thought I'd make it.
Three days grade school,
three days high school.
Those were awkward.
Three days college. I'm glad I took
a day and hitchhiked around the hive.
You did come back different.
- Hi, Barry.
- Artie, growing a mustache? Looks good.
- Hear about Frankie?
- Yeah.
- You going to the funeral?
- No, I'm not going.
Everybody knows,
sting someone, you die.
Don't waste it on a squirrel.
Such a hothead.
I guess he could have
just gotten out of the way.
I love this incorporating
an amusement park into our day.
That's why we don't need vacations.
Boy, quite a bit of pomp...
under the circumstances.
- Well, Adam, today we are men.
- We are!
- Bee-men.
- Amen!
Hallelujah!
Students, faculty, distinguished bees,
please welcome Dean Buzzwell.
Welcome, New Hive Oity
graduating class of...
...9:15.
That concludes our ceremonies.
And begins your career
at Honex Industries!
Will we pick ourjob today?
I heard it's just orientation.
Heads up! Here we go.
Keep your hands and antennas
inside the tram at all times.
- Wonder what it'll be like?
- A little scary.
Welcome to Honex,
a division of Honesco
and a part of the Hexagon Group.
This is it!
Wow.
Wow.
We know that you, as a bee,
have worked your whole life
to get to the point where you
can work for your whole life.
Honey begins when our valiant Pollen
Jocks bring the nectar to the hive.
Our top-secret formula
is automatically color-corrected,
scent-adjusted and bubble-contoured
into this soothing sweet syrup
with its distinctive
golden glow you know as...
Honey!
- That girl was hot.
- She's my cousin!
- She is?
- Yes, we're all cousins.
- Right. You're right.
- At Honex, we constantly strive
to improve every aspect
of bee existence.
These bees are stress-testing
a new helmet technology.
- What do you think he makes?
- Not enough.
Here we have our latest advancement,
the Krelman.
- What does that do?
- Oatches that little strand of honey
that hangs after you pour it.
Saves us millions.
Oan anyone work on the Krelman?
Of course. Most bee jobs are
small ones. But bees know
that every small job,
if it's done well, means a lot.
But choose carefully
because you'll stay in the job
you pick for the rest of your life.
The same job the rest of your life?
I didn't know that.
What's the difference?
You'll be happy to know that bees,
as a species, haven't had one day off
in 27 million years.
So you'll just work us to death?
We'll sure try.
Wow! That blew my mind!
""What's the difference?""
How can you say that?
One job forever?
That's an insane choice to have to make.
I'm relieved. Now we only have
to make one decision in life.
But, Adam, how could they
never have told us that?
Why would you question anything?
We're bees.
We're the most perfectly
functioning society on Earth.
You ever think maybe things
work a little too well here?
Like what? Give me one example.
I don't know. But you know
what I'm talking about.
Please clear the gate.
Royal Nectar Force on approach.
Wait a second. Oheck it out.
- Hey, those are Pollen Jocks!
- Wow.
I've never seen them this close.
They know what it's like
outside the hive.
Yeah, but some don't come back.
- Hey, Jocks!
- Hi, Jocks!
You guys did great!
You're monsters!
You're sky freaks! I love it! I love it!
- I wonder where they were.
- I don't know.
Their day's not planned.
Outside the hive, flying who knows
where, doing who knows what.
You can'tjust decide to be a Pollen
Jock. You have to be bred for that.
Right.
Look. That's more pollen
than you and I will see in a lifetime.
It's just a status symbol.
Bees make too much of it.
Perhaps. Unless you're wearing it
and the ladies see you wearing it.
Those ladies?
Aren't they our cousins too?
Distant. Distant.
Look at these two.
- Oouple of Hive Harrys.
- Let's have fun with them.
It must be dangerous
being a Pollen Jock.
Yeah. Once a bear pinned me
against a mushroom!"
19147,hehe city goes boom
19148,"good fun game
"
19149,It has hard learning curve but helps to problem solving
19150,pog
19151,Great game
19152,"Generally a pretty good game, but I have a few problems. Number 1 is abandoned buildings. Buildings becoming abandoned and having to be removed is just straight up stupid. They should just become vacant until another person buys it. Number 2 is    needed pop ups telling you how to fix problems occurring. It will tell you what the problem is, but sometimes it will not tell you how to fix it or what is causing it. I wasted hours because 3 cities I made had sewage and water pumps too close together, so everyone got sick and died. The game refused to tell me this was what was happening, so I had to have someone watch me build my city step by step.  Otherwise, the game is enjoyable and fun to play."
19153,"Takes a while to get used to, I had to watch ""City Skylines for Dummies"" on youtube to fully understand how to plat the game and what everything does. The actual gameplay is very simple and easy to do."
19154,"you build a city and try to avoid total economic collapse. 
it's like City Tycoon but much better and in-depth.
9.5/10, my only wish is for the ability to set work hours/shifts but that's not a big want right now."
19155,Finally good simulation game
19156,Sweet Game!
19157,Can get lost in this game for hours with its endless dlc. The best city builder game to come out in years.
19158,funny gamne
19159,"Not Recommended to play.
Bought this game a week ago. Can't play due to crashes, lagging issues and too much waiting and loading times. 
"
19160,Lovely graphics is enough to enjoy the game for hours. And then there's the gameplay itself!
19161,"Best City Planner so far, great with mods."
19162,good
19163,I accidentally water poisoned my entire city population. Great game.
19164,"Other than a fairly steep learning curve, I love this game! To enjoy it though, you really need to give it a chance at the beginning. Once you figure out how to create a basic b-word city with a stable economy, the possibilities really unlock. Specializing your city (or parts of your city) for lumber, or maybe crops, perhaps entertainment, all of it is up to you. Again though....you need to learn how to make a stable beginning and once you do, this game rocks!"
19165,Fundementals
19166,"One of the best city builders to date!
"
19167,love it v much an addict
19168,"He recuperat el SimCity amb aquest joc! Havia jugat un munt d'hores. Gràcies desenvolupadors per publicar aquest joc.
Es molt bò i adictiu. M'agrada perque es asequible i pots créixer amb expansions.
Porto ja 14 hores i esta desplaçant altres jocs. Un gran Joc per ara."
19169,"Good City Builder
10/10"
19170,City Skylines is a good except lag.
19171,Sim city....never heard of him!

19181,k
19182,its alright
19183,Awesome!
19184,
19185,"Well, 778 hours speak for themselves."
19186,"I got this very soon after it was released, wanted to experience the game I played many many years ago (SimCity 3000 I guess), and WOW, it was even better: Great graphics, great building tools, many available add-ons, finance, utilities, all what you need to build a real city.

But soon after Paradox started with the infinity DLC saga (which I never knew from before), so I went and bought many of the first DLC's released, and the game started getting complicated, too many things to take care of, the time to make one part better by investing in this and that, the other far side part gets bad due to crime or fires or whatever else.
I came to a point where I was unable to satisfy all the people needs and have them happy (God be with mayors of real cities !!!).

Still I recommend this game for those who like city building games."
19187,Too real :)
19188,seems legit
19189,"So much fun, always come back and play"
19190,10/10 would make a shit lake in the middle of pittsburgh again

19192,it's an epic game highly recommended very nice
19193,good
19194,"just amazing
"
19195,"I absolutely love this game. The few hours of game play was difficult but terrific. Now, I know it is not like this for everyone but this game made 6 hours on the weekend feel like 1. I LITERALY HAD TO QUIT THIS GAME TO AVOID LOSING TOO MANY HOURS. Would reccomend."
19196,"Plan every detail of your city. Or just don't and poison the water with sewage.
It's fun either way."
19197,xccc
19198,best city building / sim game
19199,"Nice game, but pushes the CPU to max within a couple of minutes"
19200,So this game is really cool but the probleme is with mods and props i dont know why but some vanilla map make my game crash but its a really good game !
19201, 
19202,It's very good.

19204,Great game! Can't wait for the second instalment!
19205,Very well designed and easy to play and there are plenty of mods available

19232,"Modders keep this game fresh and running. Compared to other Paradox titles, performance wasn't sacrificed too much with the continuous addition of expansions."
19233,good and fun i like

19237,its a nice game
19238,Sgyle.
19239,No other worldly invaders. Still better than sim city
19240,"Came for the deep city building and management, stayed for smooth jazz"
19241,"Simply put; the best city building sim of all time. No idea how they'll improve upon it in a sequel, it's that good!"
19242,"Best city builder. Tons of extra content from the developers, and mountains of amazing mods. Must have if you even enjoy city builders in the slightest."
19243,Very fun game that I've played for hours over the years. If you want a game to be soaked into and to learn here you go!
19244,Great game Better than Sim City.
19245,City builder where you build cities. 10/10
19246,top!
19247,Gud
19248,"It's a very good strategy game where you can basically can do whatever you want. If you have DLC's, it will help your experience more better."
19249,good game but its really hard
19250,sewage overflow volcano funny
19251,Best city-builder game out there!
19252,The best city sim there is.
19253,"Great game, in particular the infrastructure building."
19254,Fuck you and your DLC marketing strategy
19255,Yen Simulator 3D
19256,"this game is a a joke to play, there so many problems with the terrain. every map is the same the terrain has spikes that come up? the roadways sink below the surface???"
19257,Super flexible game. Modding support is still excellent after all these years.
19258,kitties guidelines
19259,"Only problem with this game is that without tons of mods and extensions the base game looks like a boring stuff compared to those cool YT videos. But even with the base game you can have a lot of fun, trust me."
19260,What SimCity failed to become.
19261,"Glitchy, lag so laggy, you cant even start the game 5 times with out it crashing this dam game crashes every dam second i cant even save my citys becuase if i click save the whole fucking game crashes"
19262,dont put the intake pipes by the sewage pipe BAD idea
19263,"my citizens says the water stinks, then i realized i build the water pumping station next to the water drain pipe lol. this game is amazing"
19264,Fun and not boring in my free time :)
19265,"Now it's 2 P.M. and I will deal with the traffic jam in my city...
Now that I've solved the biggest problem with traffic, it is already 1 P.M."
19266,"great city building game, great mechanics, would recommend 10/10 :)"
19267,"Can be glitchy sometimes but I think it is a really fun game to play otherwise. I think it is really great to let out some creativity and makes for a great way to kill tons of time. Have been playing for a few years, generally really fun."
19268,I think I have haemorrhoids
19269,"Whether your reason for buying this is to play around, be realistic, or whatever it may be, Cities: Skylines is absolutely a must-have. Grabbed it when it was on sale. 500+ hours worth of suffering, sandbox'ing, and other stuff done with mods and still manages to become fun to play due to the huge modding community. Vanilla-wise, it can be pretty empty, but that's why Steam Workshop support exists.

DLC-wise, they're more for the gameplay aspect, and there is a lot to offer (for cheap when on sale). Although I won't go into detail as those deserve their own reviews.

Pros:
- Huge modding community for almost everything, basically
- Endless hours of fun (and maybe also suffering?)
- Most of the problems that have been plaguing the game can be fixed by mods

Cons (most of which are mitigated by mods):
- Poor optimisation and performance
- CPU intensive (as expected)
- Long save and map loading times
- Consumes your RAM (if you go for modded Skylines)
- AI traffic can sometimes be quite stupid

It may seem that the cons outweigh the pros. But, then again, the great modding community this game always develops a solution for almost any problem that came with the game. Again, definitely would recommend buying this game, especially in a sale."
19270,Where is the huge amount of time I lost in 2 days...
19271,suitable for killing the time
19272,buggy but really enjoyable when you mod it hard
19273,"Today i'm going to make a nice and tidy countryard village, with a simple economy, few inhabitants and good services.
*30 minutes later*
Damn it, my budget is too low... i'm going to cut the trees for profit, make a low-quality industry and bring the ghettos to my city... But i'm putting them way aside from my ""heaven""
*30 minutes later*
Fuck it, i'm just going to put skycrates everywhere."
19274,dsdsfsdfvds
19275,ITS OK
19276,"I could play this everyday, i am a big fan of Cities Skylines..."
19277,Soothes my mind
19278,"love this city sim, better than other city sims out there"
19279,The best traffic strategy game out there.
19280,Trains
19281,"This airport DLC is great,brings much more joy to the old players
"
19282,"Hmm yes, very good"
19283,h
19284,"Good time waster.  Industries, Campus, Parklife, and Mass Transit are must-have DLCs.   Clocked in 35 hours in the first 4 days of owning the game."
19285,玩亿玩就天亮了
19286,"definitely play if you life management games, a few issues here and there, although it's possibly lack of understanding the AI on my part, but overall a great game."
19287,yes
19288,"Great Game, Love it a lot! Just wish that they could look at the mods we have made and adjust seeing what we want."
19289,"this is the best city building game ive ever played hands down.  if you dont know how to play, there are many tutorials on youtube about how to get started and how to make everything work.  once you know how to play, its very fun and addicting.  mods are an essential part of this game, and it gets even better when you play with mods.  i use many mods such as tmpe, move it, and many many more.  this game is usually what i play when i have free time throughout the week, and im never bored while playing it.  if you dont own this game yet, please buy it.  i bet you will enjoy it."
19290,"Love
soo much detail
the developers took there time with it 

"
19291,so nice and good that can satisfy my city dream.....!
19292,"Its annoying how all the fun stuff is behind a paywall, but making the haha funny heckhole people can live in is worth it. I suggest getting the natural disasters DLC though."
19293,"Best city building simulator i have ever played, and the dlc is great too."
19294,"If you play this game with a list of Workshop content and mods- RICO in particular- it's the best city builder available, maybe by far. You will lose track of time designing your cities. The vanilla content functions properly and provides a great base for customizing your gameplay with added content. The loading screens are a bit much, but you can't really complain about anything else. Highly recommend."
19295,addicting
19296,"As a SimCity4 veteran and modding team member, I have to say I highly approve of this game. THIS is the closest you'll get to SC4 in full 3D.

Overall rating: 4.2/5 ★

Graphics: ★★★★
The graphics in this game are stunning to say the least. Though the water effects are a little sluggish and unrealistic, the use of flow maps and fluid dynamics over fixed options for rivers and the likes was an interesting one indeed and made the game feel much more alive. There's an extensive catalogue of mods on the steam workshop too so he game can be expanded indefinitely.

Gameplay: ★★★★
Overall the gameplay in this is very good. There are a few bugs here and there but most games that deal with custom worlds of this scale would have these. If you loved any of the simcity games, you will approve of this.

Bugs or glitches: ★★★★
No game is without bugs. While I have yet to see any serious game breaking bugs or glitches, a few minor ones did cause some annoyance while playing. Keep in mind that I write this before downloading any major game altering mods which may increase or fix bugs.

System Resource intensity: ★★★★
Without mods, most systems will be able to play this game though I would recommend a minimum of 16GB of RAM if you intend to make large cities with load of mods.

Re-playabilty: ★★★★★
It's nice to sit back and just watch your city working away. I could play this for days on end, time and time again. I'm sure anyone else would too."
19297,"game is good, fun to play if you got the time. dlc cost way too fucking much, tho"
19298,Great game
19299,"Fantastic game. The gameplay is very fun and addicting and there are a lot of possibilites of things to do with your citty, especially with the DLCs."
19300,"I love this game but I am no pro. It shares that same ""everything is going well.......oh fuck we doomed"" edge.
Once you get one sector kind of worked out then bouncing on to others is easy and thats when you get to test out the real boss stuff. Metros and blimps are my favorite at the moment but im still a noob.
Its a great game, end of."
19301,this game has turned me into a diehard dictator that makes people bathe in their own garbage and shit. they pay me the max taxes possible and i let them die in their homes. i believe this game has made me a way better person than who i was originally.
19302,citeh
19303,its fun.
19304,this is a great game however it is a very large game and it is best to pla on a stronger pc however i am playing on a older macbook air and it has only crashed once or twice for me
19305,"It's a great and well detailed game. Playing it, is fun, but that can turn into anger very fast. If you make just a little mistake, your whole town/city can get destroyed. Sometimes you are not making profit for no reason and i dont know why, but my industrial places are getting abandoned even if i have a good popularity and many people. I mean, the whole industrial places i have in my city. Its hard, but i still like it a bit... would be nice, if there was a ""easy"" mode."
19306,I intentionally make my city unlivable
19307,a bit repetetive but ok game
19308,ITS BRILLIANT! (If you like micro-managing sometimes and wanted a better SimCity)
19309,Build cities and think you're a god for 221 hours.
19310,I mean its no Sim City 2000 but it still checks every box. It's a great background game for remote work hands down.
19311,city good
19312,Don't play if you want a life.
19313,Great Game
19314,You can play God and shi
19315,"fun
"
19316,This game is so realistic and makes you build freely
19317,Its so fun watching them suffer
19318,I love this game so much.
19319,"So far the best city building game I've ever played.
The mechanics is so much different compared with other city-building games.
While it complex in some ways but doesn't making it difficult to manage.

Althou quite a numbers of issue need to be fixed, troublesome traffics and garbage managements.

Overall, if you're looking for a game to fulfill your mayor dream, this one strongly recommended."
19320,"No other game has caused me to lose track of time as much as this has.. It's got a community more vibrant than ever thanks to some amazing mods and assets in the workshop, years after it's initial release. Shoutout to all of the asset creators out there."
19321,I recommend it to all the people with too much unused RAM
19322,After building some building and running the city economically running in profits i felt better then modi to feel better than modi buy this game xD (NO OFFENSE J.K)
19323,"Best city builder out there, but i will say its not worth it if you cant use mods, so dont get it on anything but steam"
19324,It's a beautiful game with a good game play. A good choice for relaxation after a long day.
19325,brilliant game
19326,Jeez It's the beez MR !!
19327,must have
19328,Pretty nice game over all i love managing the city
19329,Impossible to play without a mod.
19330,"-Start City
-Take your time to try to make every little detail looks perfect
-Watch you City slowly build up
-Garbage and dead people pile up because of a massive traffic issue 
-Panic and delete all your hard work in order to fix the issue
-City looks ugly now
-Quit
-...
-Go back to the game and promise to yourself you wont mess things up this time
-Repeat

this game is more addicting than crack, I swear it's some sort of deep state plot in order to create more city planners. But I ain't complaining."
19331,pretty good if you know what you're doing.
19332,The most in-depth city sim out there!!
19333,"Over the years, I've hardly played this game on Steam. On Xbox? Loads of hours. And it's a shame, because the console version, in my opinion, doesn't hold up to the PC version. The controls on console feel clunky, the UI is hidden behind pie menus...It sort of makes me wonder why I poured countless hours into that version instead of PC. If you like city management games, the idea of having countless mods to enhance every little thing, this game is up your alley. If you're like me, you're going to struggle. Your first few cities are going to start off so beautiful, then end up a traffic ridden, bankrupt nightmare. All in good fun."
19334,Game's addicting
19335,"Great simulator. Much more detailed than Sim City. Way more things to do and keep track of. Lots of flexibility with roads. You get even more flexibility with mods.

My major gripe is certain services, mainly garbage and cemetery, I have to baby sit constantly which take the fun out of actually building my city and making things run smooth.

Highly recommended, just say your goodbyes to friends and family."
19336,<3 this game.
19337,"I love this game, I have been playing it for over 500 hours on console and now that I pulled the trigger on a good gaming laptop I will be able to play this amazing game with mods. If you on the fence of getting this game pick it up during a sale. Right now the base game is going for 7.99 so is a no brainer. Tons of mods and maps you can use to make the city of your dreams. Let your creativity take control and see how you quickly begin to accumulate tons of in game hour played of this game in steam.. 

If you want snow maps you will need to pick up the Snowfall DLC, not the greatest DLC ever but is fun to play with it. I highly recommend this game to anyone."
19338,BUild THe Buildings AND SOLVE THE FIREFIGHRTer.
19339,nice time consuming game
19340,"Before I played this game, I used to play some of the Sim City games. So I figured I knew a little something about building. Then I watched a few tutorials to give me an idea of what's to come. And then I finally got it installed, and several hours later, I found out I had poisoned my whole city, because the water pump was too close to the drainage pump. I thought, wow, how detailed this is. Now I'm hooked.
I admit that it's not for everyone, but everyone should at least try it.
"
19341,"Remember the infinite money cheat code on the original SimCity? This is like if SimCity grew up and just got more awesome, but grew out of the infinite money cheat code."
19342,"The first city builder I ever played and honestly I loved it. At the beggining its a lot to learn and you can feel a bit overwhelmed, but after a few failures and resets I got caught and loved it ^^"
19343,"This game allows the gamer to design a city at any level they want. If they want to get super detailed, they have an endless amount of tools, assets and mods available to them to go crazy with details, down to even the placement of individual trees. But they can also step back and plan out the city from the sky, focusing on macro elements of the city. It lets you choose if you want total control over details or if you want to let the game engine grow your city on it's own.

I think the only thing lacking in this game is an intelligent inter-city machanism. It has a decent machanism for basic import, export and citizens coming into your city, but it doesn't allow you to have unique interractions between cities or have citizens live in a suberb and commute to your main city. You can make small pockets of residential and commercial in your map that resemble suberbs, but it all works as one city.

Would definitely recommend this game for those looking for a total sandbox to go crazy and build huge, eloquent, fully custom cities."
19344,Awesome quiet game
19345,Good game. Buy it if you havent.
19346,fun
19347,yeah it's great.
19348,;'
19349,"Awesome game if you love city builders, if you play for a while i recommend getting a DLC but it is not required"
19350,Endless amount of creativity. DLCs and complexity and challenges. Great Game!
19351,"Decent but formulaic city simulation game. The core game hasn't changed since the days of Intel 486 PCs. I don't know where these screenshots are from, the in-game graphics are nothing like it. Fun for a few hours but takes a real fan to keep going with it."
19352,good game
19353,Best city builder there is.
19354,Good with mods
19355,"very great game! wish there was a way to go to nearby cities and view them, or open up intercity routes, but the game is worth checking out!"
19356,Good game.
19357,lots of fun

19362,One of the most beloved game to myself.
19363,this game is good and fun!
19364,"Love it!

Do you like Sim City, Sims or other games like this.
Then this is something for you. This game is pretty good and even tho it's from around 2015 it's still a huge star!
With some mods you can create really realistic cities like your own city :) 
A game where i didnt find any bugs (except from mods) which is pretty uncommun.

19365,very relaxing
19366,Not much to say here. It's just a good city building game. If you like the genre you will probably have a good time.
19367,"I love this game except for the UI. It looks like placeholder graphics. I check in every now and again, to see if they've changed it. But in 2021 it still looks bland and boring.

Luckily it doesn't detract much from an otherwise fantastically designed game. Best city builder around bar none.

It does, however, suffer from Paradoxitis. Meaning that it has waaaaay too much DLC which balloons the full game price to rediculous heights. And I bet it keeps many people from buying, simply due to the fact that buying the original game is now seen as an inferior product.

You will also often see games suffering from Paradoxitis being on sale. But when you enter the store page and look at the game with all DLC (which would be considered the full game at this point), it then costs the same as a new game or often a lot more. So it's not really on sale, but it lures you in to check it out even though the price is kind of misleading. I know it isn't really, but it feels like it is since the original game is a subpar product at that time."
19368,bun
19369,"tentu saja saya menikmatinya, saya dibayar untuk main."
19370,I'll review it when I hit 1000 hours.
19371,"I generally like city builders, and I bought Cities: Skylines because I keep seeing it go on sale, and I figured ""Eh, why not?""  So far, the base game satisfies me.  If you don't already know, the focus of the base game is on population growth.  You design the city (roads / zoning / districts / policies), and the game fills in blanks (e.g. the game will auto-spawn residential buildlings in areas zoned for residences, and similar for commercial / industrial zones).  You design the power grid and water supply, and basically make the city liveable.  As you build it, the residents start showing up.  As you reach certain milestones (based on population), you earn cash bonuses, and you unlock other features / amenities (e.g police, fire, waste/recycling management, and parks, schools, etc.)

I'm not serious enough to use mods, and I also haven't bought much DLC (I did buy the natural disasters pack, but haven't actually turned it on....)  With no add-ons, the game feels pretty easy and somewhat zen, which is what I want.  I.e., you can turn a profit early on, and sustain it, without having to think too hard.

If you prefer a more intense challenge/want more curveballs thrown at you, then you might be interested in mods/DLC.  Truth told, I find the selection of DLC overwhelming.  Maybe after I play for a few more hours, I might have a case for buying DLC, but for now, I'll stick with the base game."
19372,"yes
"
19373,"the vanilla game itself is wonderful and any add-ons and mods simply make it better. it is a little difficult to figure out the first time so i recommend watching someone else play it but other than that, its a great way to make time fly as you build up a great city"
19374,"the mods and community are welcoming and good, and the the game is great overall"
19375,You like city builders? This is the best one on the market at the moment.
19376,what a waste of time!
19377,"make city, flood city and repeat. I rate this game 8 towers / 5 bridges"
19378,ive been playing since february but bought this game today... logic
19379,"If EA couldn't make a worthy successor to SimCity 4, then I guess someone else had to.

I'll keep it short; basically if you're an SC4 veteran like myself then you're going to love this game. Chances are, you already bought it. In which case, why are you reading this? Get back to playing it.

Yes it has a lot of DLC in typical Paradox fashion, but most of them are pretty good. If you only want the essential ones, (imo) then just stick to the main expansions.

There's no tutorial mode or anything like that. There are help messages, (which you can disable) but this is really the sort of game where it's best, and the most enjoyable to learn as you play. Also watch some YouTube videos to help you out with things like traffic planning and whatnot."
19380,"This is a way more in-depth game for fans of SimCity. There are so many more detailed things to do and I cannot stop playing it! The biggest things for me are; the ability to make your city larger, the land edit tools, the ability to control zoning density, and the detailed traffic flow options."
19381,better then sim city.
19382,"Cities: Skylines is one of the few games that I can sit and play for hours. I love building games - Minecraft and the Sims (3 & 4, especially) are my favourite games, and Cities: Skylines is up there too. The building mechanics are fantastic, and the gameplay is so fascinating. I love watching the little people running around my city. 

I love this game so much, and I haven't even been playing for that long."
19383,"Its a paradox game

dont go into it expecting all the fun stuff to be included in the base game."
19384,"Relaxing! thats about all you gotta know about this lol, it is worth every penny i put into it!"
19385,It is a realistic where you decide the fate of the city you build.
19386,"great game, way better than simcity"
19387,the best city building game
19388,very fun game for people 56+
19389,The game itself is fun and entertaining. I find myself getting lost in playing it. I also suck at it.
19390,"Fun game, good luck trying to not cause death in one way or another.
Its fun to try making a good city, and try to (Not) cause traffic issues.

The game price is fine, currently on a great discount of 75%, if i'd need to buy the game,it probably be now, when its on discount."
19391,addicted me for a solid couple days. great fun

19399,it was fun
19400,"I love this game and just like Stellaris I have bought it twice on two different accounts.

If you want to know about the game look at another review. All I can say is that this game works great on GNU/Linux. The launcher might be problematic but just disable GPU in the electron app(launcher). The same goes for ALL paradox interactive titles.

If you want to know if this runs on the M1 I can say that it runs in terms of graphics quite well on M1 max but for some reason there is insane input delay and sometimes inputs are not registered at all. This problem is not present in Stellaris at all so this is specific to Cities skylines. To me this issue makes the game unplayable on the M1 so don't even bother.


If anything I wish the game had more of a scenario and dynamic challenge system. I set up certain goals and setting a strategy to reach them is really fun but the game is honestly too easy without the DLCs once you got the basics. The maps don't really matter either which is a shame. I mean some places could be perfect for subways and others the conditions might not support it. Sure, I could imagine that myself.... okay. I wish there would be a bigger difference in the underlying gameplay anyway.

I wish there was some scaling difficulty but the DLCs do add some of those concepts with natural disasters. I guess the biggest thing missing in this game in general is what Stellaris provides and Victoria 3 is going to work a lot with. That is personality and opinions to your population. In this game you get the same messages over and over and over again from identical citizens until you are so annoyed that you remove them. Their opinions have no effect at all on the game.

If factions/politics was added it could become a lot more dynamic, challenging and frankly more fun for an advanced player because nothing really limits you in any way at all in terms of population. The best thing with Stellaris is the fact that you have to accept that your population affects your game and that makes it so fun and alive to me.

But maybe that is not a fitting concept to this game and it might be a feature that the population acts as a politically correct hive mind but I just needed to say it anyway because the GODDAMN identical messages from your cloned population for over 120 hours is really annoying and doesn't seem to have any other effect than to annoy you. It could in fact actually be informative opinions from a dynamic changing population as demographics and all that changes over time.

There is still so much that could be added to this game but the graphics start to feel kind of dated honestly even if the computer starts chugging with a 100K population it is hard to see this surviving for another 3 years that the DLC I would have liked would be complete.

Maybe I am dreaming up the concepts of a new city builder with the dice rolling and political systems from Stellaris and Victoria in a new completely unique game."
19401,Every save game corrupts even with no mods
19402,An excellent city building game.
19403,Build your dream city right at your fingertips.
19404,"Nice game, I can play this game all day but have problem about how cars choose lane to run"
19405,"My favorite way to play Cities Skylines is to hit the ""unlock all"" switch, add the ""Bulldoze It!"" mod from the workshop (so I don't have to manually deal with abandoned buildings), then just try to create a functional city. The gameified default mode is nice for getting the hang of the game but it's much more fun to build your city with all the tools you can afford and see what works and what doesn't.

I mention this to point out the best thing about Cities Skylines: you can play it however you want to. There are tons of settings and mods you can use to change how the game behaves and start building cities. Grab a map for a familiar piece of land or imagine a strange new road layout, whatever you like. The sim will show you how traffic, economics, and even water flow responds to your idea. The simulations aren't perfect, your citizens make strange choices in traffic sometimes and rivers can be unruly, but they're good enough to make you think about all the bits and pieces that make a city work (or not). Great game to relax with after a hard day."
19406,good

19417,As far as city builder games go CS is definatly one of the best highly recomented.
19418,"Not played much, only 21 hours, I have enjoyed it so far, it's on sale for a fiver when I am writing this, so you can't go wrong for that money. Definitely better than Sim City IMO."
19419,"whoever made the city is definitely sadistic, creepy music while the nature is in happiness and happy music during an array of warcrimes. I could even say this game is a horror game but not to the player but to the NPC's."
19420,Great game and very addicting. Almost unlimited creative potential.

19422,"It's the perfect city management sim, there literally is nothing better than this game."

19426,What can I say...a creation and tweak paradise :-)
19427,"There are limitless possibilities here. I've built a reasonably realistic city, and a city where i intentionally made the traffic bad. However the best part of this game is the Workshop, you can download more roads, more buildings, and much more.

My only complaints are that the game is quite poorly optimised, and that the traffic AI insists on only using one lane (donwloading TM:PE fixed this, mostly)."
19428,amazing
19429,great addictive game with all the mods and workshot assets.
19430,"It's a fun game that got a lot of us through the pandemic. Wish there was more of an achievement system, leveling system, or end goal to it -- especially after reaching Megalopolis. The great cities of the world grew to a certain size really quickly, but did they continue to thrive, grow, and improve continuously?"

19464,"What I like about C:S: It has many mods, has real time road connections like roundabouts, highways, and many assets. You even have 5 default mods installed in the game! (Its not mods, their more of cheats.)                                      What I don't like about C:S: Nothing that I hate,"
19465,Great game love it with everything in me.
19466,"I have enjoyed my time with this game and will continue to enjoy it, but i would have to say this is like sim city but different too, which in this game's case is not a bad thing."

19476,"Excellent, long lasting game with several variety"
19477,"Great game, especially when you need to relax!"
19478,"After many years of wanting to play this, I'm unsure how I feel about it. It's not as sandboxy as I'd hoped, the learning curve is huge, the mouse sensitive is hard to get right. But I like it enough. Another 5hrs and I'll probably be flowing along smoother. Currently i'm torn between watching videos for basic tips while not wanting spoilers of every exact step."

19489,with work shop mods ANYTHING is possible to have or make for your city. they really made a sandbox city building game love the game
19490,"I mean its good, I build city, I get tired of city make a save and city goes boom also mods."
19491,"This is exactly the game I would normally love to play but somehow it's just not clicking for me. I feel like the entire game almost boils down to a traffic management simulation and that can be fun for a bit but for me personally, it became kind of annoying after a while."
19492,"sure
"
19493,"So much to do on this game! I love organising and building the city, managing traffic and trying to improve continually. I have some of the DLCs (thanks Steam sales) and they keep the game interesting with new buildings, services and transport types."

This, this is how they do their business.
Useless DLC that always makes you feel like youre behind if you dont buy it.  This is not a game, it is an never ending investment."
19523,This game is not new player friendly. The game barely explains what to do. An I'm not going to watch hours worth of youtube vids to find out. when the game itself should have at least a basic tutorial explain everything but it doesn't. so if your new to city builders or you like the how simple simcity is don't get this game.
19524,"It's fun although very easy. 

 My only criticism would be that  it doesn't have car crashes, so it's possible to remove lights, add pedestrian walks anywhere and the only punishment would be...traffic.  Car crashes in other sims like simcity were incredibly impactful, and forced you into another level of strategy and design that Cities:Skylines lacks. This makes it somewhat superficial and it does feel more like a simulator than a game at times because of how easy it is - even at hard difficulty levels."
19525,yes This games very very happy
19526,"Everyone died due to diseases, would play again"
19527,Nice game with solid features
19528,.
19529,"Early game is not beginner friendly is a super frustrating an unnecessary way. Played once before years ago and it's a fun game so decided to pick it back up only to make the same mistakes I made all those years ago. Thing is it's been so long that I only remember running into those mistakes in hindsight after making them again. 

What mistakes am I referring too? Well it comes down to two core mistakes. 

1. Not placing down a road perfectly on your first try. It can be easy to incorrectly place a road and you don't know for sure how the zoning areas around the roads will appear until you actually spend money on the road. But even if paused, if you put a road in the wrong place it will instantly be built and you can only get a fraction of a refund. This behavior caused me to restart the game 3-4 times to ensure I placed all roads to my satisfaction without need to sell and lose money. (In the end my layout wasn't bad but still far from ideal) 

2. Not having a full self sustaining town before running out of starting money. This is very easy to do especially for a beginner who won't have a great understanding of everything they will need to put down before their town is fully self sustaining. So in my most recent game I had everything hooked up, roads, zones ,power, water. Except for one fatal flaw. I didn't route my power lines to the water pumps. Literally all i would need is about $500 to connect it all up. Unfortunatly, afew days after building somthing they no longer allow you any refund for removing things so I can't sell my roads or buildings to make up the cash. Well that's ok you might say, the game allows loans so you can take out a loan and finish connecting everything. Except no, you need to reach the first milestone before you can get loans. Which is to have 450 citizens. Which won't happen if you don't have water. Like why the actual F would you not allow loans by default. If there is any time in the game where loans are important it would be at the very beginning of the game. Because now I'm in a situation where I've already restarted the game 3-4 times just due to roads and now when I really taken the extra time too fully plan everything out. I find myself needing to restart the game again because of a measily $500. 

There is no fun to be had in having to restarting the game before you can experience basically anything the game has to offer. It would be far more fun to realize dang I made a mistake at the beginning and now it's going to cost me and prob give even more challenge to my starting experience. but hey at least I don't have to literally start over from scratch and throw the last hour down the drain. 

This is literally infuriating and unacceptable and I'm shocked it hasn't been addressed in 2021. (and no installing a mod is not a good solution)"
19530,So addictive and fun!
19531,great game used to play it pn my ps4 now i bought it for my pc this is the my favourite game atm
19532,"Very addictive city builder with lots to offer and a large steam workshop library with mods and assets to keep you busy for hundreds of hours. I have extensively played the epic store version since I got it for free, without it I might not have even tried the game. Steam version is a must. Epic version is seriously inferior since you won't get access to the workshop."
19533,A fantastic City Builder that will make you lose track of time. Buy the base game and/or DLC's on sale as they can get pretty spendy. What really sets this game apart is the modding community and all the amazing content in the Workshop. Happy Building
19534,"really relx
"
19535,Cities skylines looks great. It's fun for a time too. But my main issue with it is that it is less a game and more of a city model builder. It feels more akin to building a train track than actually successfully managing a city. I wish they'd pay less attention to putting out new models in the form of DLC and really making it feel like an actual game.

Takes to long to finish and get the space ship. 
(Disapointing as well as boring)"
19540,"Been playing this game on and off for a few years now. Just recently got back into it and are using the Steam Platform. Absolutely love having access to all the DLC. Makes the game that much more fun. I've played Sim City, Sim City 4 and find this to be the best of the city builders. Would highly recommend."
19541,perfection
19542,"Probably the best city builder out there right now.
It aint got shit on Sim City 4 tho :p"
19543,yes
19544,V cool
19545,"Love the game but it's lagging ridiculously on my PC; I can't do anything. The lag is so bad it's actually tedious to 'play.'  I wish it would work as smoothly as it does on Youtube videos. I've wanted this game for so long, but I'm extremely disappointed with how slow it is. I'm not a picky person, but it's grueling lentitude is enough to drive anyone mad. I don't have any special mods and there's barely anything in my PC storage. Is this what I get for paying a third of the price?"
19546,very calming but wish it had controller support 10/10 recommend playing tons of mods as well
19547,Good
19548,How much do you like DLC? Not this much
19549,"Think about SimCity Rush Hour, but instead of only being able to change road types, you can actually edit lanes, individual crossroads, all the nitty-gritty of traffic that you could imagine, including traffic light algorithms. And then add another 10 000 features to that."
19550,"city make city cum cum good game city mc.city
"
19551,GOOD
19552,gasme keeps crashing
19553,"There has never been a better modern city builder and I have played them all since the original Sim City.  

There are a lot of DLC which can be both daunting and expensive, but if you love a deep strategy game you come to look forward to those DLCs and the replayability they offer.  It is the hallmark of a great strategy game dev to get major updates, even if they carry a price tag.  

The bottom line is Between the DLC and the incredible modding community, this game delivers and delivers a reason to start a new city faster than the trucks in my never gridlocked cities."

19562,good game
19563,Don't buy this game if you don't want to work a second full-time job being an unpaid city planner. But you will get unlimited satisfaction with all the traffic problems you solve.
19564,Never loads allways crashes if  you clould help me out it would help
19565,Just a good game to waste time in.
19566,game hay
19567,like
19568,its cool....and it eats up hours of the day but chill enough to play in the background while i work from home
19569,"Very good, Would reccomend."
19570,"A really good representation of city-building games. The workshop items created by talented people made this experience much, much better. I Enjoyed this game very much!"
19571,Very nice game RECOMMENDED
19572,4.5/5
19573,"Best city building strategy game by far to date IMO...If you are a Tropico fan its basically Tropico minus the Military and politics. Primarily focused on building a city and managing it. 

10/10"
19574,I LOVE this game!!!!!! This is great for creative people with lots of time
19575,best city builder i have ever played
19576,"I've been playing this game for a while and yes i built lots of cities and others building, however, I encountered some problems that made my cities wont be able to open. ATM, i feel very very sad and disappointed on the creators and the organization because i've spent most of the time playing this game and now it's over. I may not able to play it anymore."
19577,"Even after 5 years it's still fun. Granted, it is showing its age at some corners, and yes, the base game might be a bit lacking, but it's still fun and some soothing entertainment to take your mind off of things"
19578,"quality game, well worth the money"

19582,I'd need a psychologist to explain why I enjoy this game. It's deeply seeded satisfaction.
19583,Beautifully designed game...
19584,This game is amazing and very fun if you like simulators
19585,"Very fun to try to optimize your city as max as possible. It only took me about 3 hours and one failed city to get the hang of nearly everything (such as pollution, how to properly build roads, waste management, taxes, etc, etc). I'm still trying to master some of the other things, but it's very fun. Would recommend for a single player game to just have fun by yourself with."
19586,nice game for city planner
19587,"Fun to play vanilla, but if you have the desire and the computer, mods take the game to a whole nother level."
19588,i need pipsquips
19589,"The DLCs are expensive, but think about the balls you earn. Thanks!"
19590,fun and addicting
19591,"I've played this much more without natural disasters and on xbox, but this is one of the greatest games ever made."
19592,"i made a new steam account, just recently !, have hundreads of hours with cities : skylines if you are into city builders this is the one to play, 10/10 only the old simcity's come close"
19593,What the recent SimCity wishes it was
19594,It's pretty good. 4 times better than other similar games
19595,nice games

19607,"many people spend years studying city planning - how to optimally design a city, where to place utilities, how to manage public transportation... thankfully, cities: skylines allows you to throw all of that out the window and have an even better time designing a city. is there a problem with a building? bulldoze it. water doesn't work? throw some more water pipe down in random places. not enough power? place 4 coal power generators next to each other. truly fantastic."
19608,its a really good game for people who love to build and create a city and solve traffic jam
19609,"Awesome city builder, had a lot of fun with the base game and the cold icy cities. If you are into planning and enjoy shaping the outline of the earth with massive concrete, this is your game. Do go to the steam shop and get some mods, awesome packages out there."
19610,really fun and relaxing also how detailed the game is with houses and schools. electricity is really difficult to set up and you can loose money at night for no reason also I dislike how common disasters are it just screws everything up. Love the relaxing songs it plays in the game also how the roads can turn and stuff just really relaxing.
19611,Great game to build cities with all of this cool mods that you can get from the workshop to help you.
19612,"Pretty satisfying gameplay, kinda like Civ in that you'll tell yourself ''5 more mins'' for about two hours."
19613,because the launcher breaks the game
19614,"A very cool creative game were you get to build your own places of art anywhere on earth or on a custom made map made by YOU or other creators on the website :)

19615,gj
19616,chill gameplay
19617,the game looked really good but for me i was very unsatisfied how u actually build the city and i love games like this but the game just didn't really click with me and i already refunded it cuz i didn't find it fun for me but it could be a fun game for some other people
19618,"Sure, to get the very most of it, you're knee-deep in DLC invoices, but this is the best city builder since SC2k"
19619,it's good for play!
19620,I like this game because you start off with just some land and you expand into a megacity
19621,Great game fun to space out on.
19622,I have a piss kink...
19623,"A highly addicting successor to games like SimCity, Cities Skylines is a wonderful city building sim with an impressive list of expansion content. Most of the DLC is a worthy investment, but I would check the reviews to ensure you're getting the most bang for your buck.

The city overlays are very helpful and you'll find yourself deep in the weeds of building trains, bus routes, ferries and the like in no time. Probably one of the best aspects of this game is its traffic management. Which isn't a huge surprise considering the developers previous titles."
19624,good
19625,THIS GAME IS AMAZINGGGGGGGG
19626,It has good graphics all though you will need a high quality computer or laptop or it may not perform as well.
19627,fun for hours
19628,"If you're just looking for a decent city builder? Don't mind it being a little limited? Fine with using workshop mods to expand your visual options a bit?

Then this game is good and worth the money.

If you want the complete package? Don't like tons of cool features missing that probably should have been in the game in the first place?

Then run away. Even at 50% off you have to pay $100 just to get the full package. That is disgusting, I don't care how hard they've worked at this game. I've seen harder working companies give out more for less, there's no excuse."
19629,Its a good game just the devs need to add actual car collisions and the cars lane changing because they stay on one lane when there is like three and allow PC users to drive cars and walk
19630,This game is really fun
19631,better than Simcity 100000000000000000 percent
19632,good
19633,Game crashed randomly
19634,big fun
19635,Very Good game
19636,very gud
19637,It's ten times better than Sim City. I love the mods on the workshop.
19638,It is a  very good game . At first i thought what a load of junk but give it time and you wont know were the time as gone.
19639,bad
19640,"It's a Very fun game for Building cities and doing other things if you have the DLC's, mainly building a city and then once you get bored you can simulate the asteroid that's going to hit in 2029. ツ"

19642,Way better than Sim City
19643,"ok

19644,"Amazing chill city planner: 

* Build a dam in the wrong place? Watch your city flood!

* Suck too much water out of a river? Watch it dry up!

* Traffic problems? Tear down some buildings and reorganize!

The true successor to Sim City, (which I played from the very beginning, what, 30 years ago?). Brilliantly executed. A true step forward."

19646,boogies
19647,"A city builder that naturally became Sim City 4's successor and remained the gaming community's default city builder, for better or worse.

Presentation (3/5) for 2015 - Visuals are a significant improvement over the Sim City series and seeing autonomous vehicles and individuals doing their own thing is immersive to simulating a town or city. Music and sound are there but don't particularly stand out compared to the jazzy soundtrack of the Sim City 3 and 4 games. Graphics tend to show their age when you zoom in and for some reason, the game is badly optimized - even the best computers with the best graphic cards lose a lot of frames per second and there are guides to try to raise frames per second to acceptable levels. It is common for things to drop below 30fps even without a huge city. The game's presentation lacks character - there's really no quirks to give it some flavor, you just see a plain city. The attempt to give it character and humor in the form of a twitter live-feed is known by the community to be a spectacular failure. The amount of cringe is hard for you to imagine unless you play it.

Gameplay (3/5): It requires extensive modding to make it reasonably playable, the biggest issue being the traffic AI being originally unrealistic. The gameplay is pretty straightforward (without DLC) - level up your residences, businesses and industries by maximizing what makes them happy. Higher levels lead to higher taxable income/profit, leads to more stuff to build, and so on. Services such as education, healthcare, trash collection help with that and there are a handful of factors that go along happiness. The more you learn those little details from a wiki, the better you play and I think the more enjoyable the game is. With a few key mods, it does a reasonably well job simulating the complexity of a city."
19648,Full of glitches.
19649,"Make city, Flood city, Destroy city."
19650,"Pretty nice ! I remember watching videos of this game when i was a kid , I liked it a lot and i still do ! 7/10"
19651,Very fun. Brings out your creative side. Pretty addicted to this game ever since I bought it. I will always be able to go this game.
19652,Good and fun but runs like ass on my decent PC. Ran fine when I first had it and now I get low FPS on low settings on a small city. It is quite hard but fun to design a city. I played this after watching RT Game play it on twitch so I guess I assumed it would be easy. I would still probably recommend. Likely better with Mods but I haven't tried it.
19653,its ok
19654,"Even with the vanilla game, you can enable options to make the experience as challenging or as chill as you want. Add mods to function as quality of life improvements on the UI or for an additional challenge."
19655,i lik gam cuz buildng
19656,"its good
"
19657,yes
19658,"play this on the ps4 before playing this again on pc and i gotta tell you, this game is awesome and playing this on pc with mod is just incredible. but i wished they fix with the not enough buyer for product issue when you reach 100.000+ population because i already try to fix this alot by building new road for only the industrial zone , snd following youtube tutorial and stuff and its still not working. hope they fix this issue"
19659,i liked it
19660,"I LOVE THIS GAME SO MUCH IT'S LIKE HAVING AN ADDICTION TO DRINKING GASOLINE (my addiction is just as strong with this game as it is with that) 

i wish i could make a dictatorship and enslave all of humanity. also make sure you don't stay up until 4:32 in the morning"
19661,"fun,simple, and easy to have fun."
19662,very hard just play fallout 4 if you want to build towns and print money
19663,Very good game to play and I made a big city that I like to my point
19664,fun
19665,The perfect Sim City
19666,"For me, this is an excellent simulation and City Builder game. It includes different kind of terrains, each one with their own special features, you can use a huge amount of elements to build the city of your dreams.

Every decision you make has consequences, your population will grow up or will decrease based on what you do with your city. It's amazing.

Good graphics and sound. 10/10."
19667,"Amazing city building game
"
19668,"If you're looking to play a city simulator with easy to grasp yet in depth tools, this is definitely a game to pick up."
19669,"fun game, needs some improvements but no complaints"
19670,"is gud, i leik"
19671,lovely
19672,Like chilling out and losing your days just building stuff? This is it
19673,very good. buy now.
19674,Do you enjoy losing hours of time without knowing it? If yes buy this game.
19675,"Played this the first time in 2016 and now I got over 600 hours playtime. This game is insane. If you are looking for a city building simulator where you can detail everything and doesnt feel static, buy it. All the dlcs and the workshop integration made this game incredible detailed you got so many ways to play it or build your citiy."

19683,Still the best SimCIty there is.
19684,"When I want a relaxing time, I check mark that unlimited income and build the city of my dreams.  I really like that they made that an option. I don't want to stress myself out dealing with income, taxes and all that nonsense. I can just focus on the building part of it. Super handy. Anyway, this game in general is absolutely amazing. One of my favorite games, for sure!"
19685,Great game with fun dlcs like the industry dlc
19686,is a great game but i do recamend tryng to save up for DLCs for it
19687,Fantastic Game. I've been playing it for only a few days and I already know this will be one of those games I end up with a few hundred hours on.
19688,great!
19689,"pretty good, just take a while to start your city"
19690,ok
19691,"A fair bit to learn, but enjoyable so far"
19692,No new content after about 15 hours playtime. Becomes extremely stale after a single playthrough. A waste of money if its not on sale.
19693,"Vanilla = no.
Modded = Y E S."
19694,"Would've given it a thumbs up, maybe, if not for the toxic and shitty community that this game fosters. Who knew that a game about building cities could attract worse garbage gamers than some hardcore PvP titles?

I sure didn't."
19695,"good game, definitely worth the price on sale, tones of replayability and suprisingly relaxing, good game to play if you only have a little bit of time and just want to relax, would recommend to anyone"
19696,its a good game
19697,"NOISE POLLUTION! NOISE POLLUTION! NOISE POLLUTION! Like just stop already, all I care about is your tax money not fixing the damn roads! But overall great game, would totally recomme- NOISE POLLUTION!"
19698,"The best city builder out there, you literally cannot get any better city-building game. This game has a TON of mods and assets to make it even better. There is no reason you should not get this game if you like simulation or are getting into it. Btw on most steam sales this game is 8 bucks and its a STEAL."
19699,"Amazing Game!
So much detail, And even better that there is a community workshop!
10/10!"
19700,I made a dick-river
19701,"Good game, but you kinda need multiple dlcs and mods to properly enjoy it, especially if you're into urban design and stuff. in game assets/infrastructure is ok, but lacking in some areas like roads with bike lanes and smaller roads, stuff like that. If you're cool with mods, or are even comfortable with creating your own mods, this game is great (very mod supportive)!"

19709,good
19710,!!!
19711,"I was really excited to play this game because I had seen others play it, yet i booted it up and it crashed, then crashed other programmes on my pc. I booted it up again, it wouldn't let me start a new game or load. I closed and booted it again, and it had reset all my configurations back to default, then it did the same as the first time. My computer isn't the best, but other games work perfectly fine and I even set everything to the lowest. I want my money back, don't play this if your PC isn't really good.

EDIT: I issued my refund and it was successful. If you have low memory (I had around 4GB and it wasn't enough) then DO NOT buy this. City Skylines seems to not handle memory well."
19712,wayy too much fun

19716,Are you city builder? this game for you :)

19718,hghgjhg
19719,"Now this is more like it.  Once you've got some roads built and have assigned them as residential, commercial, and industrial, basic buildings will begin appearing. Add nearby services like police stations and schools, and amenities like parks and plazas to allow buildings to level up. You can also use a brush tool to divide your city into districts. Districts are a great feature, allowing you to tinker with policies and regulations like recycling, free public transportation, and legal drug use, without having to unleash them citywide. You can tax your districts differently, and even ban industrial traffic in congested areas (just make sure to provide heavy trucks an alternate route). You can also create industrial districts to focus on oil and ore mining, logging, farming, or general industry."
19720,"If you started playing SimCity and you wanted more features, this is the go to game. I have never returned to SimCity and Cities: Skylines is so much better. It is god-like."
19721,"it,s very very nice.this is my love.the dream of city building"
19722,It is the best after SimCity 4. Some getting use to the game play but there are a lot of tutorials on the web to guide.

19742,BEST CITY BUILDER
19743,p good lol
19744,"it's good

19746,it keep crashing
19747,this game is the best game ever for people like me.  i have a learning disability
19748,fun
19749,good time killer
19750,very good game for building your own city
19751,"Way better than sim city lol. The game is the best, and because it was on sale I got all of the dlcs . . ."
19752,"Sweet and relaxing.
Very well put together and community mods only make it better.
"
19753,"Good game, can build cities. Best 7 hours ever
"
19754,great game for casual playing
19755,"This is really the best city builder you can play right now. The modding community is thriving and there are literally hundreds of thousands of mods and assets that you can install to enhance your game, completely for free. Are you interested in railways and metros? try the Metro Overhaul Mod. Are you interested in roads and city design? You won't run out of new roads to try on the workshop. Want some new buildings? The workshop has you covered with almost every single building imaginable. Think of ANYTHING you want in your city? 9 times out of 10, the workshop has exactly what you're looking for. Not only is the workshop amazing, the developers and publishers actually CARE ABOUT THEIR GAME! (Not something you hear a lot, I know). They constantly update the game with new DLC content, but they also support content creators for the community. If you were thinking about getting this game but weren't sure, just get the game. Trust me, you won't regret it."
19756,"First 3 Cities were total failures then #4.  Ahh yes #4 my first success, I considered deleting it because I lacked the confidence I could fix the traffic issues, but I did and 9 hours later......... I was so immersed 9 hours passed without food or water for myself, but my citizens were obviously the priority. 

No mods, just a few of the DLC's so far, I can see myself spending hours discovering those in the future so much bang for your buck here!"
19757,"Fun, especially if you get things on sale or use PSnow. It's not for everyone but, if you're looking for a game like the classic Sim's City for playstation then you found the best comparison."
19758,I love it
19759,"Fuckin' dog shit.

-Bugs
-expensive dlcs
-Vanilla game is super-boring.
-Typical Paradox game. DON'T BUY. THE WORST MISTAKE OF MY LIFE. I WANT TO DIE :C"
19760,It's an AMAZING game. Really.
19761,Very fun!
19762,"The game itself is easy to pickup and learn to play.  The only issues are around features breaking at different times.  For example; I have had 3 separate cities have different things break.  The policy panel just wouldn't open, so I couldn't adjust any policy, I have had the industry panel break where it wouldn't go off screen and multiple times in game the functions of the game simply stop working.  Where You can place something down and no matter what - no power or water will ever be seen by the building.
Along side that - the base game seems to break its vehicle count right about 20-30k citizens, like clockwork.  Nothing functions.  Your dead won't get picked up, your police won't respond even one house away and the garbage will not get trucks out.  I am sure that is directly linked to the 16k limit to vehicles in game at any time.
Shouldn't have to mod the base game to make it function correctly.
Other than that?  
The game is great to play.  The unique buildings, the ""tech trees"" to get more buildings and making whatever layout you choose to make this fun to plan and play.
If I had a ""star"" rating for this game out of 5 I would give it 2.5 - only because of the features that break.
If you include mods that fix some of the base issues, then that goes to a 4 star.

19763,very very good
19764,so good josh get new games dumb fuck
19765,"Absolutely amazing game, I have spent hours just building and designing and haven't even scratched the surface of this game. Now there are some amazing DLC which I will be picking up to add to my city. If you are looking for a city builder / sim this is 10000% going to be a great purchase."
19766,"This game is very good and I recommend it because it works well as a city builder, don't play this game if you have a slower pc/laptop."
19767,tax = pog
19768,How to control the map has changed since I started and I miss being able to mostly use the mouse to move around. They also changed how you upgrade your zones so you must remove the existing area zone in order to place a new one. I could get used to the controls but am sad about losing population (when dezoning) just to upgrade the zones. I might check back in a few months and see if it has changed but I don't recommend playing this game overall anymore. It just isn't as user friendly.
19769,its a great game that's all
19770,One game I have almost every DLC content for. Great community and modding community. The support from the devs to the modding community is brilliant as well. This is one of those games and team where you will buy just because they are behind that title.
19771,With Mods it is awesome!
19772,paradox game
19773,"Playing this game has really made me appreciate so much more what all needs to go into making sure a city is running well and smoothly. It is also a great game for folks who aren't good with the fast-paced or battle-heavy action games out there, but want something to keep their attention. I find that I completely lose track of time when I play—sometimes a good thing, sometimes not! I'm having a last with it so far, and definitely recommend it for other people."
19774,Good for me.
19775,"Such a great game. The mods, unbelievable."
19776,didnt know this was in my library 10/10
19777,been completely addicted to this game for years now it just straight up never gets old
19778,"Game has known bug with blurry text in various ingame notifications, devs know about the issue but aren't fixing it."
19779,Runs great on MacOS compared to Windows
19780,road
19781,I didn't expected I'll be hooked up on this game even it was released few years back. I didn't realized I'm playing 8 hours a day as well lol. Best RTS game! Love it!
19782,"Love this game
"
19783,"A lot of variety and variables to account for (you know, a typical Paradox game). If you like that sort of thing, this is for you."
19784,i fell in love with this game over and over again.
19785,good
19786,"Good game to kill time, would totally recommend playing it with mods to add more content"
19787,Ax
19788,road go click
19789,buy this is surely the best city building game i have ever seen
19790,Good

19794,yes
19795,"I don’t recommend this game because you get bored so quickly, always you need to do the same things and you can’t play with your friends. I played 13 hoyrs and i think i will never more play this game🥶"
19796,"This is a great game. My favorite city sim by far. I wish the base game didn't still have so many bugs, but it's great in spite of that."
19797,Overwhelming
19798,it ok
19799,really good
19800,Best city simulator ever. Period.
19801,Stellar game with great tutorials; even my mom got addicted and she's an old person
19802,The best city simulation ever made.
19803,good game
19804,its good
19805,
19806,its like a really good game
19807,Fun. That's it.
19808,Absolutely the best virtual city game ever!!
19809,"Great game to pass your time.
Offers a nice city, great traffic, and other simulations.

If you like to solve logistics problems this game is a great.
It's very cheap too as it's always been on sale. 
After years of owning this game. I still like to come back to it.
"
19810,is fun yeah
19811,love to build and manage and this allows me to do that while still building a beautiful community.
19812,"good game. like it alot
"
19813,yes play
19814,Very complex but extremely addictive.
19815,Solider
19816,yes
19817,"It's one of the, if not, the best modern city-builder game created. The community has been amazing and developed this into a rich experience. Just, make sure your gaming rig can handle it!"
19818,fun
19819,This game has infinite options to build a great city!  I have been playing since it first released and it is constantly getting DLCs to keep it fresh and real.
19820,What SimCity should have been from your childhood.
19821,Great for city designing
19822,"Zen Garden of city building, I really enjoy it."
19823,"I wanted a Simcity type game. Not a spreadsheet boring as F game with very little help.

This game sucks. Like complex does not make a good game. Reason I like simcity better. Simcity told a story. Even with the flaws and bad parts of it. Things happen in my city, and it felt like I was watching a movie. Skylines, is for them neckbeards who think games need to be complex to be enjoyable. 

If you really enjoy that type of game more power to you, but I'm going to stick with Simcity."
19824,Great city building game personally i like to stream it
19825,VERY VERY
19826,it's a good game
19827,"Very fun this is, perfect to get creative as ever and make your city dreams come true!"
19828,"If you like games you can play mindlessly, you'll like this. Play It. Thanks."
19829,relaxing
19830,This game is awesome because you can go very realistic with it.  With a lot of mods to achieve this. Way better than Simcity or any other city builders before!
19831,This game is Rock. This game is Roll.
19832,"I can play for hours and not notice, my only complaint is that they need taller sky scrapers. better graphics and more boats and transportation. Although this is about base game. With mods and DLC's this is amazing!"
19833,mods are practically better than dlc's
19834,Pretty cool!
19835,"Definitely a fun to play game, but with a couple of caveats...
As someone that likes to tinker with maps in the editor, I find it silly that tunnels are not allowed in editing. Being able to add tunnels within the editor would allow so much more creativity without having to jump thru hoops to get the look you are after. Also, I think some smaller roads should be available in the editor as well, like the basic 2 lane & gravel roads.
Yeah, there are workarounds, but these two items are pretty basic, and would make map creation so much easier."
19836,"hehe city go brrr
"
19837,"This game is  one of paradox's best imo. I can spend countless hours and not get bored. It is a true masterpiece. The only complaint that i have is that the frame rate is mediocre, but playable. Otherwise it's an amazing game and you should check it out if you can"
19838,i made pp shaped city it was epic :D
19839,Very fun and in depth.  You can build a city how every you can think of.
19840,Beautiful city sim.  Lacks granularity like Workers & Resources: Soviet Republic but much prettier.
19841,"This game is really fun especially if you like building cities, towns and any other things."
19842,Best city building game after simcity 4!
19843,pls make free play i dont really like how no free play your money gose down so fast
19844,i like destroying cities.
19845,Still the best city builder out there. Lots of extras and mods. Hundreds of hours of gameplay.
19846,Very funny
19847,too many dlc   but cool
19848,10-10 will build my whole city with 2 lane roads and regret it later on again
19849,A great city builder and my new favorite game.
19850,one of the most amazing City builders. i totally reccomend it its by far the most beautiful and easy to play game. although you need to be carefull!
19851,I love this game
19852,"I enjoy this game so much, but it's so unbearably BAD with it's flaws!

This game is so horribly optimized that it can barely operate with a 3060! The prices of the DLCs and base game are so mind-numbing and there is so many useless DLCS included in the 150+ dollar game at full collection. This game is so desperate for optimization for new gen hardware! I am praying for the devs for CS2 but they keep on giving me stupid cash-grab DLCS.

I love this game so much man. I don't want it to die like Sim City. Please fix the game, Colossal. PLEASE."
19853,Cities Skylines is lub! <3
19854,Calm and fun game to go to everyday.

19857,"- Great traffic management, though not realistic
- Almost endlessly expandable with mods for buildings, themes, roads, map terrain, etc
- Map builder is very user friendly
- Full of challenges but never too hard to play"
19858,crashes alot due to too many outdated mods but thats an easy fix. its a great game if you love city building
19859,Good.
19860,Calm and fun game to go to everyday.
19861,mantap
19862,this game slaps
19863,a game about building a city
19864,I love when games get into it and this game really got into it.
19865,10/10
19866,Its so fun. A new classic!
19867,This is a great city building game where you can experience the fun of being a mayor!
19868,Very fun -- fits both casual and intense playstyles.
19869,"As a city simulator? Fantastic. As a modded game allowing you to plop individual buildings? Fantastic. As a traffic simulator? Fantastic.

It's showing its age at this point, but there's a reason that not a single other game gets recommended more for city simulations than this one: It is the best there is, by far, for a wide variety of reasons.

You played Sim City, you played Anno, heck you might've even played Banished, now come play the (current) best cities simulator of them all: Cities: Skylines."
19870,epic
19871,very epic
19872,My citizens drink poop water.
19873,"good game, somehow most of my cities ended up drowing or like pompei. not my fault"
19874,"Let me tell you something... This game, it... (and I know it might sound crazy) .... has the ability to control time.
On first open, you might not notice, because you have to understand the game before the time traveling magic can happen. On your next re-open of the game you might have figured everything out like I did, and before that play session you may have also only had 1-2 hours played in game like I did. Suffice to say at the end of said play session I was bewildered due to the fact my Windows Clock said 4 pm in the bottom right corner of my desktop. ""How could that be?"" ""Must be wrong"" I thought to myself but, sure enough I had tacked on 18 hours to my played time. I got up from my chair once to pee. That was it. My theory on the matter is that this game makes you focus so intently on making the best city available and not killing your citizens accidentally that it actually warps your brains perception of time. Anyways have fun! 10/10 would recommend <3"
19875,"Very good game and a worthy successor to SimCity
"
19876,Traffic sucks
19877,corrupted save. irretrievable. NO mods
19878,very cool game
19879,fun bame
19880,is ok
19881,"grate game
"
19882,"Like SimCity 2013, just better in pretty much every way. Having 175+ hours in SimCity, I jumped over to this game, and I doubt I'll be going back any time soon."
19883,"Fun game to chill out and build a nice community or metropolis. even better with all the mods.
The many (and pricy) DLCs are a bit offputting, especially because some have essential things in them. A lot of this can be circumvented with mods though, which isn't less dumb but sooths the pain a bit.

If you like(d) SimCity, get this one. But wait for the frequent sales to buy the DLCs"
19884,"This game will never bore you ! With the endless support and extended workshop with lots of assets and mods to customize your game / city it is just priceless and good for many, many maybe to many hours of fun gameplay. It has a steep learning curve to build a good working city especially with all the (important) mods but i advise to watch players like Biffie and other on YouTube. Great thing is, if you have a spare hour or half a hour, or many hours you can always launch it and game as short or long as you wish. No rush or anything. Excellent active community makes this game still relevant even in 2021."
19885,"i lie3k gAM EBUI,DIUNG CITY"
19886,"addictive, great game"
19887,yes
19888,"Very cool city building game, although you need a powerful pc to build larger, more detailed cities, and loading times can get a bit long, but overall still really fun game, worth its price."
19889,"this game so funny!!
"
19890,"This is probably the best Building simulation game out there. The game has many DLC to buy, and if you can get them on sale they each do add a lot to the game. The base game is also great alone and i would recommend this to anyone who has time to kill as this game will do that."
19891,Hours of fun if you like to create and build.
19892,Truly engaging and a game that you keep you for days and days. I really love this game!
19893,Great City Builder
19894,"This is a great game -- probably the best city simulator I have ever played. The graphics still hold up years later, and they have done an amazing job with updates and all the new features they bring with each DLC. Yes, buying the DLCs can be expensive, but the base game is well worth the price, and you can have hundreds of hours with the base game (+workshop mods, if you want). Wait for sales to grab the DLCs. Each one has some great add-ons and I have always found them 100% worth the price.

One thing I like about Colossal Order is how they listen to the players and make changes that have been asked for, often in amazing ways. For example, many complained that the old agricultural and forestry industry specializations could not level up, and this often led to them being frustrating to manage. The easy way to fix this would be to just have them able to level up. But instead, Colossal gave us a whole new pack with the ability to custom design our industries, put in specific building types where we want, and create supply chains from one point in the city to the other. This type of management was impossible in the old system, and they put a lot of work into making it nice. They used a mechanism similar to the Parks mechanism for this, and then did the same for colleges/universities. Each time they have exceeded any possible expectations I have had. So yes, lots of DLC to buy, but none of it is necessary for a working base game, and all of it adds value and replayability to the game. 

This is a fun game that I have played for almost 200 hours, over years. I play a city for a while, leave it, come back, start a new one, try out new features, come back again later, etc. You can play it however is fun for you -- it's completely flexible and you can make of it whatever you want. Hard to ask for more from a city sim."
19895,Great Game unless you have ocd
19896,"bruh i love building cities
"
19897,"Out of all the city builders I have played, this is the best one I have ever played. With that said you would think all this DLC they have released would have been included with the original game. But nope, it ain't. The base game is decent. You can make a nice original city but if you want to replicate a city you love say Tokyo or LA, you need the DLC and workshop content.  
Consider getting this game and its DLC only on sale, only then is it worth it. Keep in mind some of the DLCs is pointless (I'm looking at you music station dlcs)."
19898,its fun you can build road
19899,"Rome wasn't built in a day...  It was more like 386 hours of Cities Skylines.  If you like to build / create things, this is the prefect game for you."
19900,"Cities: Skylines is the best city building sim available on the platform. Great graphics, great modding scene, extremely in depth yet accessible. 10 / 10"
19901,the game is fun
19902,"Cities Skylines? More like best building your own traffic problem 2015-?. No seriously, this is by far the best city building game I have every played. The graphics are clean, the music is beautiful and the whole athmosphere is amazing. The water, electricity, trash, fire+police+ambulance department is very good and complex in it's own way which makes this game even better. The only problem... the traffic... if you never had a traffic jam in this game, please leave some tipps below. Traffics lights, highways, tunnels and roundabouts are not helping my cities at all.
Here some things you need to know: This game takes a good bunch of RAM, makes your GPU ventilator go brrrrrr and transforms my PC into an electric grill. It is not lagging, but if you want to have a beautiful experience, you PC has to get a bit hot. I still recommend buying it and all the DLCs!"
19903,"This game could be so much better, thankfully we have tons of mods, I haven't played the sim city ones but still I spent every second of my free time here, so I may say it is the best city builder game today."
19904,game
19905,The ultimate city builder.
19906,"Can't stop playing, love it"
19907,memphis
19908,Love the play through possibilities with dlc and workshop.
19909,"fun :F
"
19910,"The ultimate city builder, there's just no competition."
19911,"Very fun and has amazing objectives
"
19912,This is the best city-builder made in the 21st Century so far. Lots of options and some decent affordable DLC provide huge replayability.
19913,"One of the best city building games I've ever played. The animation, data sheets, and freedom of city design is just amazing. Hope the game designers can bring more variety in architecture. Highly recommend for gamers interested in city design, management, patience, and have the time to dedicate to the game."
19914,the only good game
19915,Thanks
19916,"Hands down, the best city builder out there for now."
19917,veri nais
19918,"Very addicting, the best City Builder there is right now imo, but it does demand a very good computer"
19919,"good
"
19920,good
19921,The best City Building Game
19922,yes
19923,best building game for children my son love it with mods so thank you for the cretures who made the mods
19924,A city builder to rule them all.
19925,I really enjoy the designing feature of this game. Has kept me busy for hours.
19926,"shit good




"
19927,flooded my first town with sewage water and killed over half the population. 10/10.
19928,"A very fun, detailed and addictive city builder with an even more in depth modding community.

I recommend browsing forums to see which of the DLCs you find worthy of buying as well as browsing the workshop, as you will probably end up adding at least a dozen mods.

I spend one night just managing the trafic with the TM:PE mod. No regrets.
"
19929,"VERY BAD.
I always get killed:(
Tons of hackers you motherfuckers.
תנו לצהל לנצח."
19930,nice game
19931,I have been playing this game for 2016 and finally i can bought the original one
19932,"Love this game, have spend countless hours just playing! :)"
19933,"It's what your child-brain remembers Sim City was, before that franchise died."
19934,Best city builder out there.  Make sure to take advantage of the great mods in the workshop.
19935,👍
19936,NICE GAME
19937,f
19938,"Absolutely recommended.  This is what we all hoped Sim City would be.  It's beautiful to look at, everything makes sense, and there are so many mods in the Workshop you can, theoretically, build hosts of different cities each game.  There are mods which are somewhat important to have to make the game work better (traffic managers, etc.), but they're easy to install and with them on the game is amazing to play!

Also, do yourself a favor - download Road Anarchy and build a road down the side of a cliff.  Just do it."
19939,Super Fun and Creative game best city builder so far
19940,Very realistic.
19941,"This is the best city sim available. 
If you see this while it is on the Summer Sale and you remotely like this style of game, do yourself a favor and pick it up. As of this post it is under $8 and has mod support...."
19942,Boring
19943,PLEASE JUST USE MORE THAN ONE LANE I CAN’T TAKE THIS ANYMORE
19944,Rich mods and good foundations make this an infinitely replayable city builder. Some of the DLC is questionable.
19945,"This is a great game to sink into at the end of the day - relaxing but engaging, and there's always more to learn about it."
19946,"Cities: Skylines is the answer to SimCity that any fan has been hoping for since the 90's,

I put countless hours into SimCity 4 over 3 computers and a good decade of time. And when I found modding websites for it?! MIND BLOWN.

So to find an even more in depth city building simulator, with an even more dedicated and adept modding community... well I think it goes without saying that this is the pinnacle of the genre. 

I could go into detail for hours about every little intricate part of this game you can adjust to build and manage the ultimate city and it's transportation/utilities/services/etc. But really my question is, if you're looking for an amazing city simulator then why don't you already know about, and play, this game?! GO BUY IT"
19947,Very Fun Game! Would recommend to everyone that likes to build and have fun!
19948,Awesome game
19949,"It's the ultimate city builder. You'll forget Sim City even existed. WARNING, taxing on your computer, definitely research performance boosts"
19950,I like. Very nice.
19951,Hella fun
19952,Great game
19953,"While I hate Paradox's DLC policy, and you could honestly do well without them, there's honestly no better city builder than this one and it keeps getting better."
19954,the best game of its type
19955,"[b]I have spent an estimated 557 hours (23 days) playing this game.[/b]

Sure, some of those hours were spent haphazardly paying attention to my city while watching TV or working. More may (or may not) have been spent with my city unattended - its coffers growing at breakneck speeds while tornados, wildfires, and tsunamis danced through town [i](a true simulation of modern city management)[/i], but I digress. 

[b]This game is incredible.[/b] I haven’t played it seriously for quite some time, but if I’m ever itching for a city-builder, this is my go-to. If you’re looking for a city builder, it should be yours too. 

Once you get the hang of things, it’s a laid-back, relaxing game that offers incredible traffic simulation (that will lead you to think differently about your commute) and a massive library of community-created content from highway designs to building styles to maps.

[b]The game strikes the perfect balance between creation and management[/b] - where you can pivot between the two without sacrificing one or the other. In some game sessions, you want to create a new city (or expand a previous build); in others, you may just want to manage a city you’ve already worked hard on.

As for DLC, [i]except for Sunset Harbor[/i], every DLC pack has breathed new life in the game, adding more nuance and more hours to imagine a city of your making.

[b]PS. Gold FM FTW.[/b]"
19956,i like the game it is quite fun building cities even if it bad at it i reccomend this to people interested in building games :D
19957,pretty cool not gonna lie. But i dont play much
19958,relaxing
19959,"decent, 4/5 good game, has its flaws. for how much DLC there is it really seems expensive. traffic can be silly/frustrating (TM:PE helps a lot)"
19960,In-depth city sim game with tons of customization and options. I have barely scratched the surface.
19961,good
19962,Better than the latest Sim City. Love it
19963,Good.
19964,It's definitive to the genre at this point.
19965,The be all end all of City Builders.
19966,"Very amazing game! Has advanced AI, very good graphics, and an amazing soundtrack!"
19967,Wow wow wow so fun :> COol :< awwsum
19968,"I think it's good, but not worth $30 imo. And the vanilla content is ehh, a little bland with same/similar buildings everywhere that can tarnish the design of the city, but it does offer up one of this game's selling points, the workshop. The workshop can just change all of that with better customization, even some new features iirc.

I would recommend to buy this game on sale."
19969,The best stimulation game ever.
19970,one of the best games i have played in a long time. i just hope they make a second game and have them improve on the ability to place car parks and optimizing the game to run better. To many mods will cripple your performance. the game looks passable in the graphics side of things but some stuff could be improved on. thank god modding is allowed for this game. The commuinity constantly keeps this game alive.
19971,I wrote this with 2 400 hours played. Nothing else to say.
19972,fun
19973,rio grande simulator
19974,i really like this game but this game has one bugs this is the example: when i try to close cites skylines the game freeze after that unfreeze again and its also still running i do it but it didn t work i do lots of time and it won t work so i have to shutdown my pc. [sorry if my [grammaly is bad]
19975,Love this game. If you like simulation games you will like this. Will definitely recommend this.
19976,I have spent way too much time than i should have.
19977,"A full-featured city builder for the 21st century. I absolutely love this game. My kid absolutely loves this game. Build things. Watch them grow. Connect them up with water pipes, buses, civic infrastructure and monorails. Watch them grow more. Adding mods is very simple and the level of customisation it takes you up to is immense. The soundtrack is great and the graphics are gorgeous. Buy it. Play it. You'll love it."
19978,Hands down the best city simulator I've ever played!
19979,I have problem turning it off. Just wanna keep playing.
19980,best city builder game so far
19981,"Wife: Does this game ever end?
Me: That's just my first city.."
19982,"Fun, deep and with loads of mod's to fill your time for the next 350 years..."
19983,"my game always forced close for no reaseon, please help or any solution"
19984,Nice game.. Addicted to it hahahaha
19985,amazing game for those who love building cities
19986,"If you like city building games this one is pretty decent.
"
19987,I've been playing this game for years and still love it. Mods are my favorite things.
19988,"A city builders dream. with realistic scenery, thousands of ideas for your ideal city, Thousands of mods and assets ready just for you, no wonder this game is a Gem!"
19989,fun
19990,yes
19991,"so full of detail and such a good strat game. the graphics are decent and the amount of time i spend on this game is already insane.
"
19992,Great Game! So much content to digest and eventually utilize lol.
19993,scddcsdcd
19994,"This is the best city builder out there. I did not purchase any of the DLC. Despite that, the vanilla experience is varied, fun, and can be challenging at times. I definitely recommend this game."
19995,10 times better than Sim City 4. Would be cool to drive and walk/interact with the cities we build.
19996,"SimCity - 1991.
Cities: Skylines - 2021.
Itch: Scratched."
19997,good
19998,Today I told my best friend this might be the best game ever.
19999,y
20000,Cities skylines is super enjoyable. It is fun to expand your city and manage your citizens
20001,Best city sim out there.
20002,Wrrrrrrmmmmmmmm wrrrrrrrmmmmmmmmm wrrrrrmmmmmmmmmmm traffic is fun
20003,"A master piece for anyone that enjoys city builders, i played ps4 for about a year and realized this game is nothing without mods! Also the workshop has no limits on what is there. 9/10 Hours and hours lost into simple sections detailing because there is no limit!!"
20004,the city of phoenix arizona is a disaster and should be razed to the ground it stands on
20005,make your own detroit sim
20006,its ok but its boring after a bit
20007,Really fun city planning game
20008,Can be played with one hand and is therefore perfect if you have a sleeping child in your arms
20009,"Game is an amazing city builder, 9/10."
20010,Plinknar inc.
20011,Great Game
20012,One of the best city-building simulators out there. The community workshop for this game is absolutely massive and is definitely an essential part of this game.
20013,:OOO
20014,gg
20015,"I initially bought this game after watching Biffa's traffic fix videos around 2019 and immediately I got addicted to the point of barely sleeping.  I'm absolutely loving this game and with a community this creative and innovative, there's always something out there to keep you interested. Definitely recommending Cities: Skylines to anyone who can pour hours on end letting those creative juices flow."
20016,very epic
20017,"Best cities building game. Its like you managing the real city, the details of management and everything. Really recommend this for those who love the city management game."
20018,"Take this review with a grain of salt, because in the end I do not enjoy this type of game. I am still giving it a positive review, because I can appreciate that it is the pinnacle of its subgenre, well executed and polished to a high shine, but for a genre I do not seem like.

I like city building games like the old Sierra titles, where goals are pretty concrete, and there are eventually pretty clear ways to optimize a city. I like learning curves, I like tinkering, I like complex systems, but I also like eventually solving problems. In Cities: Skylines you never really solve problems for good, you just improve things here and there, and as the city grows those problems resurface. There is no one way to optimize, just many small ways to improve. You may have goals when you start a map, but ultimately its not really about a campaign, its about making the city that is the ""best"" it can be on the constraints of the map you have.

What I am trying to say is that I like puzzles, and Cities: Skylines is a sandbox. Its a very good sandbox, a very pretty, complex, well integrated sandbox, but I simply lack the motivation to properly finish any map. I want to solve the problem of the map and move on and this is just not that sort of game. You return again and again to the same city, to the same map, growing it and improving it over many play sessions. 

If you are like me, you will not enjoy this game. However, if you like a sandbox and think growing a city is its own reward, and that sort of things interests you, Cities: Skylines is the best of its kind."
20019,gg
20020,This game really gets boring fast.
20021,Best modern City Builder
20022,"A great game and hours of fun. lots of mods and great community support. 

IF YOU LIKE TO USE LOTS OF MODS / ASSETS , YOU WILL NEED LOTS OF RAM ON YOUR COMPUTER
16GB bare minimum"
20023,"Fun and challenging city builder, still learning the ropes on this one."
20024,great game
20025,amazing
20026,Great game!
20027,Airports feels like a clean cashgrab. way to expensive for the content added

20030,good game
20031,THE best city games.
20032,Build a city and waste a lot of time.
20033,the astronomical amount of difference between this game and other city builder games is borderline illegal since it's basically a monopoly
20034,"It's good though it has it's issues and if you have a slightly bad computer it'll be like lagging all over.
"
20035,Built a cool city
20036,"Word of warning, this game is 40% city simulator 60% traffic simulator. I recommend watching tutorials and installing mods such as traffic manager presidential edition to aid in your constant battle against traffic. But once you learn how to work with traffic this game is truly fun, its the best city simulator out there without exception."
20037,epic
20038,I absolutely love this game.
20039,"Incredibly detailed (with liberal use of mods and custom assets so PC Only) but a huge commitment.   I am over a 1,000 hours in and still feel like a newbie.   Awed at the base programming, and what the community of creators has done with it.  This game/simulation/creative exercise got me through the Pandemic."
20040,"With close to 200 steam games and many AAA titles, I have more than 3,300 hours playing this game to make this my number one game. Cities: Skylines is THE game if you want to build and manage a city and its transportation. No other game of this nature even comes close as of this writing. It also has the most extensive modding community and content that I have ever seen in any game. If that doesn't entice you to buy this game, I don't know what will."
20041,"I use to love the old sim city games where you were just building a city, not doing anything directly with the people. I found this game and love playing it. I have a blast trying to create new cities and see how they develop. Only real con is trying to find a way to properly manage traffic, but it doesn't make me want to stop. 9.9/10"
20042,This game is trash.
20043,"runs really good and can spend hours on it
"
20044,fun game
20045,build city time
20046,is gud
20047,too mqny sus
20048,The best city gameplay ever.
20049,Awesome. Challenges your mind.
20050,It looks and plays great. Strongly recommend to people who like city builders.
20051,it's a game..i mean..a real game..with its purpose..to make us enjoy the moment..
20052,very good game with mods but needs inprovement with performance
20053,"Best city builder out there, hands down. To compare this game to Sim City seems disrespectful but sort of inevitable... imagine if Sim City 4 was taken on by a different developer, perfected, refined, beautifully presented, and given more complex layers of depth, then you'd have Cities: Skylines. It's intuitive, generally easy to play and I can literally sink hours into creating beautiful cities. The DLCs have added a wealth of additional features (I've purchased them all except for the radio packs), and the modding community is amazing - so many talented people have created mods and other stuff that have become indispensable to the main game.

If I had to be super picky and choose things that could do with improving, I would go with the following: 

1. It's easy to get started with the game but if you want to really refine your city it takes a lot of watching videos on YouTube, the game doesn't provide clear enough information in some instances. For example, you have demand gauges for residential, commercial and industrial (+office) but these aren't broken down into enough detail so you never know whether you need more industry space or office space, you zone more industry and then all of a sudden they don't have enough buyers and they're going out of business (even though the gauge is still up?!). 

2. I would love the ability to have multiple cities/towns linked together in a region (like Sim City 4), allowing you to have more specialised cities that can interact with each other in interesting ways. I would love to have a university city, for example, that a nearby one could send its citizens to instead of having to build its own. You have total freedom to design your city how you like but it can become a little generic when you *have* to have certain buildings, or types of building, in your city for it to develop. 
 
3. Some additional guidance on creating public transport networks would be helpful too... after over 1000 hours of play I still, for the life of me, cannot make a profitable bus network. Train networks are super expensive and difficult to plan in from the start because of this, but then it's also easy to overload your tracks with trains and then totally back up the line. 

4. The way that the game handles death, cemeteries and crematoriums is kinda bizarre. Build lots of places to house your dead cims! 

All of the above I view as very picky and have not affected my enjoyment of the game. If you like city builders, you will not regret getting Cities: Skylines. If you're new to City Builder games then Cities: Skylines is the best place to start."
20054,The traffic won't go away and now I can only think of Civil Engineering whenever I see roads.
20055,"It dose work with Intel onboard GPU, eaven if they say it dosen't.

20057,still the best building game yet
20058,very nice
20059,Build a city and hours go bye
20060,I build city
20061,good game. addictive if u are into city planning.
20062,"Hands down the best city building game on the market. It's a joy to play, and each map can be built so many different ways. It's a great game without any expansions and a masterpiece with them!"
20063,Best city sim out there
20064,"gg
"
20065,If you liked Sims then this is better. Great community and mod capability to let you be as creative as you want.
20066,is good
20067,"great game, eats up a lot of free time."
20068,"While not exactly like SIM City games I played in the past, which is what I was looking for, this game was surprisingly fun. It can be a little more in-depth than Sim City games, but plenty entertaining. I haven't played a SIM City game in years, but I felt like this game was better in the sense of freedom play. You can do more than you would normally in the traditional SIM City games that I've played."
20069,I love this game heaps. I also play it on another platform. You definitely need patience to play this game but if you love building then this is the game for you.
20070,
20071,"Very fun game. If you like to build your own city, with its own economy then this is the game for you"
20072,Ever wanted to build your own city? Ever wanted to build a city then eliminate all the civilians via natural disasters? Ever wanted to create the biggest city in the world? Cities: Skylines is the perfect game for you.
20073,"I like Everything about this game, the only things that get me frustrated in this game are the mods and that's not on the developers, but on me"
20074,good.
20075,Pretty good
20076,yrs
20077,This game is really fun to build cities (even tho I suck at it).
20078,best city building game
20079,"The perfect game to kill hundreds of hours, especially if your picky and love to micro manage every aspect of your city... with mods the level of detail is insane. You can play it however you want, the sky's the limit really."
20080,Yes. Good. I like the tiny people. They exist because I will it so. I am the power man.
20081,"Don't play with a slow computer. it will completely ruin the game for you since you'll spend hours at a time in loading screens. once you get past this, its a really good game. Really fun and captivating, but it takes a huge L when it comes to accessibility on older computers. You're not gonna be able to play on something like a Dell Laptop. All in All 7/10"
20082,good
20083,"It's fun,  takes some thought,  Ever drive in a city and thought - If only they did this...   Now you can test out your ideas."
20084,"No fun at all

Too much dls"
20085,"Good game
"
20086,"Amazing game, great to relax your nerves."
20087,"Mod Support saves this game, it adds features that should be in the base game and makes it the best city-builder experience!"
20088,.
20089,great
20090,.
20091,what a beautiful game. Love it!
20092,"You an get lost for hours in this game, endless possibilities. One minute it is all going well and the next you are bankrupt =D build a complex city with transport links and rake in the cash, the only thing that annoys me sometimes is the road snapping."
20093,I'm very nice
20094,Awesome game!
20095,"It's so fun, love it!"
20096,Very good game. Lots of things to do and manage. The DLCs add a whole new level of depth to the game which makes it much more interesting :)
20097,"Первый градостроительный опыт Colossal Order не прошел идеально гладко. Некоторые внутренние механизмы игра робко прячет, а мы вынуждены при этом опираться на вторичные показатели: то же строительство плотин производится на ощупь, ведь ни уровень воды, ни высоту над уровнем моря нам не укажут. А что производят предприятия? Куда девают? Как товар попадает на полки? Конечно, вы можете проследить за грузовиком и догадаться, но нельзя же наблюдать за каждой фурой! 

Но огрехи наподобие этих легко излечимы патчами и модами, и эту игру они погубить не способны. Пускай что-то остается за кадром, все остальное здесь предельно ясно. Cities: Skylines — умный и гибкий симулятор мэра, со множеством полезных настроек и действительно живым городом. Который, вдобавок, не дает спуску. 

Плюсы: обилие разнообразного контента; живой, изменяющийся город; непростой финансовый менеджмент; разумная система «прокачки» зданий; милый городской «твиттер»; интересно построенная система прокладки коммуникаций; игровой процесс не приедается.
Минусы: в базовой версии не слишком много карт; нет влияния на визуальную стилистику города."
20098,Man I love this game!! Do you love city builders? It is the best one I have ever played!!
20099,good
20100,"Fun game. Lot of DLC, however this game does have a lot to offer."
20101,"fun game, play good"
20102,"Very, very, very fun. I didn't think I'd like the game because it's not like anything I've ever played before, but it has quickly become one of my favorite PC games of all time. The DLC's are awesome, too! Just got the bridges pack and I'm sure to be adding more soon."
20103,"Would not recommend this game for Fedora Linux 34. Launcher is unresponsive and crashes, making the game unplayable. In addition, even if you do bypass the launcher, the native version of the game simply stays on a black screen forever.

Linux users: stay away."
20104,city game make computer go brrrr but it looks pretty sometimes so its worth it
20105,Y/N
20106,good.
20107,The best city-building game of all time. Nothing else even comes close.
20108,It really is a fun game. It forces you to think critically and find the source of the problems occurring in your city. So many things to create and customize. Access to steam workshop is a huge bonus. No real complaints or bad things to say about this game.
20109,I like playing it.
20110,bruh
20111,"love it 
"
20112,pog
20113,"Very Good !
"
20114,"Overall, Cities: Skylines is a great city-managing game. Honestly, there are so many factors that play in making your city functional and keeping your civilians content. I was also really suprised at the amount of detail that went into this game. If you zoom in really far, you can see people walking around and cars driving around, but each building has a unique style and a different name. I've been playing this game for quite a while now and haven't experienced any bugs that affected the gameplay."
20115,Yeah nice
20116,like sim city but you can replace cars with blimps
20117,"Only reason I can't recommend is because it's Paradox.  For whatever reason, they decided they had to verify my email but the email won't go through whatsoever and since I can't log in, I have ZERO way of contacting an actual person to fix this issue.  Pretty terrible customer service and won't be buying another product."
20118,i likeburning everyone ive ever known in my city for the fun of it
20119,great game
20120,fun
20121,my small brain cant comprehend how to build a stable city but i like it
20122,It's a good game for people who like to project their city.
20123,Very cool
20124,"The logistical problems are endless and fun. 
Satisfactory."
20125,This is how Simcity should have been. The best city builder by FAR.
20126,"Best game ever, when u have medium-end pc it still runs very very well! buy it."
20127,"I used to play Sim City and enjoyed it, but when I discovered this game I changed and found it much more fun and challenging. Now I would not go back (apart from the fact that I cannot seem to get Sim City to work properly on my latest computer). A great game that I want to get into more by creating my own buildings and networks (although I will probably have to ""borrow"" some of the props already in the workshop)."
20128,If you want to have a nice city building game this is the one. Even more fun with more DLC's. Just do not but the content creator packs because that is useless
20129,Magnificent game! The process is extremely fun and satisfying.
20130,"If you enjoyed SimCity but found it lacking, this is the game for you. Take control of most aspects of your city and its economy, and grow it into a vibrant fabric of simulated society. Mods and assets complete the package. Most DLC is good (I've had that on PS4), but the Steam Workshop has most of what you want anyway for free"
20131,Good
20132,nice nice...
20133,when you save up around 11$ this game is good even on low quality pc
20134,This game is amazing! I started on PS4 and after watching videos I invested in a gaming laptop so I could go to the next level!
20135,I bought the new player bundle pack.  Eveything is downloaded but i cant get the 3 dlcs to work
20136,Good game but once you reach a population of around 35-40k there is very little left to do. I felt that the original game had very little features and the additional DLC also barely adds much I love City Builders though so I do recommend but deffinitley try to get it when it is on sale!!
20137,"been stumbling but catching myself the whole time, room for learning from mistakes. 10/10"
20138,"Best game of all times, excited to see what CS2 will look like!!"
20139,Beeg ceetee
20140,I just keep coming back to it. best city building game ever!
20141,"This game is so relaxing. Apparently I've been playing for 1,996 hours!! Its just so strategic in a way 1000/10!!!"
20142,i build shitty city boom
20143,Killed my city with litteral doodoo water on my first save game. 10/10 would do again
20144,it's good
20145,Great game mechanics overall.
20146,This updated game has something going on at all times - continued play.  When I played before (2015) there were too many glitches and crashes.  I am enjoying this revised Cities: Skylines so much that I forget about the time.

20149,Great!!!!!!
20150,"Good and realistic game except when people complain about dead bodies with a crematory across the street. You could quite literally yelled ""kobe"" and basketball-tossed the corpse right into the oven."

20152,"fun challenge
"
20153,cilled my cpu but it was worth it
20154,Never bored.
20155,"I'm only a casual player, but really enjoy this game. Would recommend."
20156,"This game is very fun, because you can be creative and build a city, just as you want it. This game has a lot of features and isn't like any other city builder games. You have to think about a lot more stuff to create a good city. So it isn't simple either."
20157,A much MUCH better version of Simcity. Very intuitive to play and fun. First time playing almost put 7 hours in the game. Very realistic and lets you be creative with your cities. Great SIM game.
20158,.
20159,Quality
20160,Cities nuts bitch
20161,very fun
20162,.
20163,Best city builder game. The level of details is amaaazing. The game focuses on macro management. IT is going to take time to learn how to play so dont get upset if you first cities dont turn out well or are clogged with traffic. Overall this game has every thing i would expect from a city builder game. The dlc are a must and are quite expensive which dampens the experience if you dont have them.
20164,I goof around a lot withit.  I mostly play after visiting another city/country to recreate what I saw.
20165,i have benn playing the skylines after work-off days. very interesting game absoutely
20166,I just bought this game and it wont load and I cannot play it
20167,This is the best version of SimCity yet.
20168,"A company that monetizes pre-existing customers without opt-in doesn't deserve your money.
It's a great game from good devs, but unfortunately a scummy publisher.
If you're considering buying the base game or any DLC, please do your part in discouraging this behavior and avoid it."
20169,best city builder game out there still after all these years
20170,"Nice Game
"
20171,sus
20172,"its a vary good game and has a lot of ways to make and expand your city and i would recomend but one thing i found out with the game at least for me is that once i get to over and sometime under 100,000 people the servis stop working like the police and fire dep.  so yeah, but over all its a good game, (also if you can help me with the over 100,000 issue please help)"
20173,hours of fun
20174,Good game :D
20175,great game
20176,"Strike 1. It uses a second launcher
Strike 2. It is extremely DLC focused, it feels like instead of a content update like some games have, Cities: Skylines just says ""Screw it, make them pay for it""
Strike 3. Base game doesn't have anything that makes you want to keep playing on that save. After a certain point, it feels like you're just adding onto the pile rather than developing a city, and this is only a couple hours into a save.
"
20177,This game is very relaxing would recomend
20178,I like lego and this game is just endless fun and frustration. I would like to have freeform parks and more control in traffic.
20179,its j good
20180,Built a town next to a river. Said town started to overflow with sewage and kill off half my population. It's a great game.
20181,Best city creator/management game for a while now!
20182,I didn't realize that i lost power to my sewage outage and my city became a ghost town :C :C :C
20183,Fun
20184,An Addicting City Builder that will always leave you wanting to build a better city.
20185,5/10
20186,.
20187,"I'm not great at reviews but what can i say, this is one of the best city builders going, even just the base game you can have hours of fun and the modding community behind this is amazing also, the fact that modding is encouraged just makes this game worth buying all round. Even after 2 years of playing both PC and Console version im still finding things out about how to make my cities better. Its well worth any money you sink into and its a nice chilled game or a grind however you wish to play it."
20188,Yay!
20189,e
20190,"If you like city builders this is a great game for spending a few hours at a time being a mayor, unique maps and builds are almost endless.

Wonderful community as-well mods are excellent."
20191,addicted like crazy.. thanks quarantine 2020
20192,"its Fantastic! you get to build your own city, including everything from Zoos to parks to subway stations to plazas, its just amazing"
20193,"I love this city builder. I've been playing them since I first picked up Sim City 2000 back in the mid 90's and Cities Skylines is by far my favorite.  The attention to detail truly shows in this game.

10 / 10"
20194,Fun game my neice loves the game she builds towns!
20195,I'm not any good at it but damn is it good for killing time and feeling accomplished while simultaneously not being productive at all; should be nicknamed Traffic Manager though
20196,Really good games with unlimited replay ability only down side is that some dlc’s are mandatory if you wanna expand industries or have more transit options. Difficult to understand what is going on at the beginning and you can download a wide variety of mods through the workshop.
20197,You ever felt like making a road that looks like spaghetti?
20198,Its fun you can basicly do what ever you want and you can choose lots of maps
20199,"Graphics 10/10
Feeatures: 10/10
Music: 8/10
Love this game. A real challenge to control graphic but that only makes it funnier. Really recommend it. Some DLCs expando you exprien greatly (i totally recommend Mass Transit)"
20200,nice not hard but challenging enough to not bore me out
20201,"Very good, a few features aren't very intuitive however."
20202,Too Much DLC for what the game offers.
20203,i liked this game a lot it depends on how good of a computer/laptop its a 5/5 game for me LOVE IT
20204,"It's a good game - but the flaws just make the experience unenjoyable to such an extent, at least for a vanilla (no mods) experience.
A lot of basic functions such as traffic and garbage begin to fail very quickly even in a reasonably well connected city with very little than can be done to fix the issue at times. Every now and then finnicky roads, railways, and other items, will not act how you would expect making building the city quite difficult.
Not to mention that on any lower to even middle end PC (I know this from experience) you can't even reach the end game of a city without suffering lag beyond belief due to the RAM requirements."
20205,Bought it and it was free on epic games but it's fun if you know what you're doing unlike me
20206,"The game is easy to pick up, but has a lot of complexity to keep enjoyment going."
20207,One of the best but hardest games I have ever played. I gives a real insight into how hard building and planning a city really is. You will need at really good computer if you want to play the game with smooth FPS and medium graphics. Definitely worth the money but I would recommend buying it on sale if you can.
20208,drown in shit
20209,"It's exactly like Minecraft except it's not voxel based, not first person, there is no survival mode, no crafting, and its a city building game."
20210,Beautiful game. No complaints.
20211,"The game in itself his good. How ever using the just the Vanilla game and a few addons published by paradox, no mod it take 12 minutes to load... It is extreamly unstable. I  do not have this issue with FS 2020, Hearts of Iron 4, Kerbal Space program, and other software more demanding in graphic and memory. I can only conclude on bad game coding. 
"
20212,better than sim city
20213,YES
20214,Best city building game to date!
20215,it is a very fun game that i recommend to all
20216,"my small brain cant comprehend how this game actually works neither does it know how to play the game properly

good))"
20217,good value
20218,"Great game love it!
"
20219,It's a great city building game. I would recommend it. yup
20220,ive been playing these kind of games most of my life ( I'm 62 yrs young) and i must say this game City:skyline is the best ever
20221,Epic game
20222,还行~鱼
20223,nice game ole likes sag dik
20224,****
20225,very fun game
20226,good game
20227,"This is a pretty deep city Simulation - it has a steep learning curve but once you have crafted your city, it is insanely addictive.
You will need patience to succeed in this game. and expect to spend hours watching tutorial videos."
20228,"noice
"
20229,"Seems cool, full of features. I just lack the attention span to stick with it for more than an hour.... or in this case 20 minutes. Maybe one day I will play again."
20230,Amazing game you should try it!
20231,"This game was advertised based on its dynamic traffic AI. A colony of ants is smarter than this game's AI. I've had multiple cities grind to a halt and completely implode, *entirely* because the game's AI refuses to use more than one lane of the three-lane road it's given. The game's AI is legitimately retarded, and it will destroy cities for no apparent reason. I will never recommend this game to anyone I know. SimCity 4 is a much better city sim in literally *every* aspect."
20232,It's ok but I can't figure out how to not make a city go bankrupt before I can pay off the loans and it's getting really annoying starting over ever few hours worth of play time.
20233,One of my favorite games. Its so immersive and fun. The building and devolving is so amazing! The mod community is fantastic.  one thing is don't like about the game is the cost of the DLCs.
20234,play for years and its still addictive
20235,Very good and complex whilst I had this for the duration It was free
20236,Ж
20237,Its very good game if ypu like simulation city
20238,Roundabouts.
20239,ITS GOOD
20240,AMAZING EXPERIENCE!!!
20241,"This is an incredible game. From the detailed graphics to intricate mechanics, it is very well constructed. Your success in this game will be dependent on strategic planning and patience. Each city is a slow burning candle that will consume hours of your time.

Take note that it took me roughly 15 hours or so to understand the game's mechanics enough to not drown. Unfortunately, many of the game's mechanics may necessitate seeking out help from others on the internet as the in game UI can be vague at times. 

Beware the bars on the bottom of the screen, they will guide your construction of your cities.

Buy it NOW."
20242,The tax payer can't escape my bad roads

20244,"One of the best city builders out there, and with the addition of mods it just cranks it up to  1000"
20245,Best city builder/simulator out there no question.
20246,"I've been playing this game for years and by far it's the best City Builder not only on the market right now but the best City Builder of the last decade. It has the support of the developers AND the community so you have a lot of content avialable.
With the DLC thingy the only DLC I really recommend it's the Industries one, that's the real game changer that add a hole new level to the game. For the rest of the DLC don't worry you can get them later. Even the vanilla version works fine with mods.

It's a must game if you really like the city builder genre."
20247,D I E
20248,"Taught me a lot about IRL systems & satiates my design and community needs in a sense, as well. <3"
20249,Probably the best city building game ever made.  There continues to be content released from the developer and also countless mods from the huge and very active community.
20250,great
20251,Game is dope.
20252,"The game is pretty good, and is definitely fun, although most of the content is locked behind DLC. I'd only buy it when it's on sale, it's really expensive, and the DLC makes it even worse."
20253,It is a prime city builder. Best of any I've tried.
20254,"It's great but you kinda need some of the expansions to keep the game from becoming build residential, commercial, industrial, expand residential, expand commercial expand industrial, build parks to keep people entertained"
20255,"The Sim City comparisons are obvious, and this is what I wished that game could be."
20256,I really enjoy playing this. One of my wonders is exactelly looking at city skylines and this game offers this experience in the most realistic and godlike way. Playing this you also realize how difficult it is to run a city but you can overcome by learning new strategies along the city's history and with each new city. Love it!
20257,I grew up with SimCity and this is everything that game never was. Awesome game with much more detail.
20258,"Want to get away from the hustle and bustle of real life?!?!
want to comprehend what its like to run a fully fledged city with over 300000 people coming and going?
do u feel up to the task to manege natural disasters??
this game is best played drunk.......like really dunk, or stoned or jacked up or high. which ever is your poison u will enjoy this game with all of your sou..... well what will be left of your soul anyway but alas por yourrick........this is a shit hot game....get it you fooooolllll!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
20259,Great city builder and a proper successor to Sim City 4
20260,good
20261,Everything Simcity should of become and much much more
20262,"Probably the most in-depth city builder out there. really good, lots of fun, and a boat load of mods if thats your cup of tea."
20263,Regret.
20264,Fun to play
20265,Super good game! The base game itself already great but it is way greater using the mods and assets from the Workshop. Highly recommended for those who like city builder simulation.
20266,big city big fun
20267,It would be nice for the really popular and helpful MODS to be part of the base game. Won't buy any new DLC until CS2

20269,"This is a great game, I've had a lot of fun with it. You're going to need to read up a bit on road design though, roundabouts won't solve all your problems."
20270,"Best city building game around
"
20271,"i havent even played this game, why am i getting prompted to review it?
"
20272,Relaxing and fun city builder simulation.
20273,The best sandbox game i've ever played.
20274,I always loved simulation games. This one is top 5 of all time best sims out there.
20275,Best city building game I have ever played
20276,yeye
20277,"'tis dope. With or without mods. Take your time and learn from others how to make efficient cities, but at the end of the day, make something that you like to look at. Just take moments to explore your city. 
Highly recommend. My fiancee and I are quite addicted."
20278,+1
20279,Still good in 2021.
20280,"After playing this game for over 750h I can say, that this game is the best and most creative simulation game since The Sims 2. Even more so.  Where The Sims turned to the wrong direction, Colossal Order realized what makes a game truly great: - community! 
A game with such a wonderful and creative community and developers understanding how important community and their creativity is to the gaming experience, this game is more than a sum of its parts. It sucks you in to the world where everything is in your power, where only limits are your limits of imagination. If it doesn't exist yet, you or some other gamer are probably inventing it already! You are a true creator of your own cities."
20281,Good.
20282,"Having played the SimCity for years, I was tempted to give this a shot. It's a much slower game and takes time to build up your city, which took time to get used to. Having played through to a fairly large city, I can say I am genuinely enjoying the game. The secret seems to be planning ahead and going slowly. As you play, you unlock more squares (up to 9), so thinking this through means you have a better chance of being able to acquire that bit of land you will need by the end of the game and have a better chance of zoning areas to maximise connections between areas. Going slowly lets you grow your cash (and avoid issues with too many cims reaching the same age at the same time). for example, not putting in the bus lines as soon as they are available will reduce the chances of running out of cash before your city can afford to run them
Pros:
- While my city has problems that are challenging, they do not seem un-survivable or relentless (though I can see how a city could fail). 
- the ability to tweak options to suit your game play (e.g. unlimited funds) means you can select to play a more challenging game, or just focus on building a functional city without having to sacrifice design
- being able to modify some aspects of the 'assets' yourself is a nice bonus and the range of extras from the Steam Workshop greatly adds to game-play and keeping things fresh
- the level of details in the graphics is great, and the fairly regular 'rewards' for reaching a milestone are worth achieving.
Cons: Negatives are, as another writer said, outweighed by the positives. But there are a few bug bears that affect game play to some extent. 
- Some of the controls are not as intuitive as I'd like or inconsistent, e.g. right clicking will cancel in some building tools but not in others. 
- The algorithm running water in the rivers has had me scratching my head - why would putting a pump at the end of the river cause the middle to dry up? (Resolved by modifying a water treatment plant to also outflow water. That this was possible without having to load other tools is a nice plus.)

Overall, this is an engaging city builder with good graphics and great support online and in the steam workshop. Two thumbs up."
20283,Great game
20284,doo doo fart
20285,"Amazing game, been following it for years and only got onto my hands on it last year and it's been a good experience.

Suggest this game for nostalgia if you've been watching Youtubers playing it and debated on buying it, you should because it's as fun as you think it is, can be boring if you don't have much of the DLC, so suggest buying all of the DLC if possible when a sale happens most likely this summer, or a back to school sale."
20286,"It's pretty good, I mean it's not like there's a ton of competition here so if you've ever enjoyed sim builders then why wouldn't you try this one?"
20287,i played and then i saw 1240 errors!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! i enjoi :))) :sunglasses:
20288,.
20289,"Cons:
- There's a LOT to improve. And it's quite annoying that the community has to take care of so many mods, which some are really necessary to enjoy the game, and then the creators happily release more content without all the necessary additions, and then all the incompatibilities make the game crash every other load on a good day... 
- The tutorials and tool-tips are quite poor and superficial.

Pros: Everything else? It's the Simcity 2000 of the 2020's. You can enjoy the game casually, and it's very nice, but you can also dive deep and handle SOOO many small details that make it so much better. Worth the mods hassle."

20291,fgghxfgh
20292,nice

20296,kinda bad ngl
20297,Build a nice city or build HELL
20298,"Forgiving, you have time to fix problems and gives you recovery time as well.   Great strategy game.  You will go through trial and error, you will fail at first because there is so much to learn.  I like that you can pause the progression of time and do/figure out what you want to do, especially when there are big problems happening."

20308,"Yes, this is a great game! I really enjoy the imagination the developers have given us when designing a city. The addition content really provides extra excitement/features to the city."
20309,"I recommend it if you have a lot of time on your hands. However, if you plan on sporatically playing, it'll just turn into traffic nightmare simulator. Heavy reliance on mods at a certain point."
20310,nice
20311,good games
20312,cars
20313,good shit
20314,It's very fun. You'll probably play for hours.
20315,"A mostly self-driven game, Cities Skylines is the ultimate city builder and simulation game this decade. Hours can feel like minutes when you're just trying to add one more district, add a new metro line, or try and solve that congestion bottleneck that's causing gridlock in your city.

Steam Workshop support allows for users to customise the experience to their liking, whether it is adding in unique buildings and assets stylized after real-life structures, tweaking the build and AI settings to draw neater grids and smarter traffic, or maxing our your GPU and CPU temps with visual overhaul mods. 

Once you've built (and more likely destroyed with traffic jams) your first few cities, it can be easy to spend just ""one more turn"" adding some finishing touches on an area or strategically placing trees and props to add more character. The game adequately paces the availability of new zones to purchase so you can really see how your city grows over time, and once reasonably into the game, you should have the adequate space and funds to plan out your settlements rather than patching up problems with utilities and traffic along the way.

Plus, it's always nice to zoom really far in after you've built up a good portion of your city and see the detached suburban homes of your new development juxtaposed with the sprawling skyscrapers you've built in the background."
20316,"In Cite Lines There Are Various Tasks To Row the city skylines.

A functional netting will lead to a growing city... Hello and welcome to City: Skylines! In this game you will create a City in which you must make for all of the"
20317,"The game on Xbox is fantastic. I have put well over 200 hours into the Xbox variation. The PC version, however, is horrendous. And it is 100% due to the controls. You cannot use standard mouse drag to pan the camera, but instead, are forced to use ""WASD"" to pan the camera. This can only be changed to other keys, but you CANNOT pan with the mouse. This is the single biggest issue with the PC version, and the major reason I believe it is not worth playing on PC. I am serious, these controls are unusable and unchangeable. 2/5."
20318,i like it
20319,Would play. Very cool game. Read the manual for help. Youtube is a great source tooo
20320,I've been delaying this review because their a company that has some pain in the ass DLC. Such as which ones you want/don't want. Or which ones are a stupid aesthetic and which ones change the way the game works. But it is a great game with an even greater modding community. I would suggest getting the suggested mods from a guy called city planner. I use at least 30 or so mods when I freshly install this game. It is the best city simulator by a long shot. Simcity is such a trash game it hurts. SimCity 4 deluxe is fun though.
20321,Excellent game! So satisfying to see your city grow and flourish!! Base game is fine to start off but to get more in depth i recommend getting as many of the bigger add-ons as you can. You don't need the smaller ones as much only personal preference. Honestly mods are a must have to get into the nitty-gritty of traffic control and other features to make your life a little easier. All in all a very chill game that you can jump into anytime!
20322,"cool building game, reccomand for your kids"

20335,"Way too easy to engross yourself for hours. Lovely game, endless possibilities."
20336,yeee
20337,"Best city building game, a complete experience that does everything city and transport sims tried to do over the years of this genre.
Pros:
Beautiful graphics.
Realistic traffic and transport that brings a challenge to the game.
Easy to learn.
A large array of community maps, props and mods.
Amazing DLC's with a fair price tag
Cons:
You really need the DLC's to fully experience the game.
Traffic issues can overwhelm new players."
20338,"Super realistic city designing game would 100% recommend, there is almost no limit to this game with sandbox, hard mode, thousands, if not millions of downloadable mods and assets and maps from the workshop. There is an unbelievable amount of content in this game... almost instantly became my favorite game."
20339,nice
20340,its worth the money!
20341,"Basic stuff should feel basic, feels like you need a PHD to even build functioning roads.
Being forced to learn a games quirks to be able to even play it, is not the way to go about a game."
20342,"Awesome game, no bugs at all. Its way easier to manage your city on PC due to mods, such as Traffic manager, Demand Manager etc"
20343,The best and most realistic city building game hands down. I've spend hundreds of hours playing Sim City thinking it doesnt get any better than this... I was dead wrong. With many  new  DLC add ons and new mods coming out daily this game will never get boring. You can build whatever you can imagine. Happy Building!
20344,.
20345,"Honestly, I just really like building transit networks and vibing in my big city"
20346,"ruining peoples lives since I first bought the game 10/10.

I dont think I should be allowed to play this game.

kinda boring sometimes but who cares."
20347,"100k city, full send a cataclysmic tsunami."
20348,the game is very nice but it would be better if the traffic flow was a little more realistic
20349,"In my childhood was a game named ""CityVille"" dang... i got my dream City all goods all prefect...
but facebook decide to close it... and all time i try do this again.. make again great city like i love it... make me happy when im in game and see all goods.. 
but is history...
Sad point... it will never return and my child brain and creation never be there again ...

i recomand couse i like this type of game..

20358,Best city building game with full DLC purchased. Unbeatable experience.
20359,I enjoy playing this game. I spend hours mindlessly building roads and cities.
20360,Fun game!
20361,"Good Good, i build town and town get flat by big wave uwu"
20362,It a good game
20363,Killing people is fun.
20364,It's a spiritual successor to Sim City.
20365,It is a very fun game But they would need to fix their preformance issues for lower end pcs
20366,city boy
20367,This has to be my favourite city management game of all time.
20368,"this is an excellent game, it allows you to build your dream city with very handy and free mods from the steam workshop or you can go full vanilla (no mods)

pros: free mods, map editor, no limitations of what you build, a massive steam workshop with over 200,000 mods/assets, works on many PC's

cons: takes a long time to load a map if you have mods installed, stutters for a minute when loaded a city with 40,000k+ population

overall, it is a very good game, 9/10"
20369,love it
20370,"Everything you expected from Sim City and more, Paradox once again doing another companies job!"
20371,"Currently the best City Builder on the market. Until they make a new SimCity, Cities: Skylines, is where it's at."
20372,Keeps crashing. amazing game but save a lot!
20373,good
20374,what Sim City Dreamed of being
20375,"Absolutely amazing game, even in vanilla. Possibly the best city-builder of all time- and that's only the base game. Even lightly dipping yourself into the plethora of mods available allows you to experience something you can in no other place. Easily in my top five favorite games ever."
20376,"É divertido e dá para passar horas jogando, mas sofre do mesmo ""problema"" que Sim City e The Sims, muitas dlcs e conteudos adicionais que poderiam ser juntados num pacote só e num preço mais acessível"
20377,"A renowned title for its success in filling the gaps left by SimCity upon its... dare I say it, demise. 

This is a stunning game to play for the sheer sake of its massive simulation scale. I'm not saying you won't find a single flaw with it, which includes slightly poor performance at some viewing angles and city sizes, not to mention (sometimes funny) buggy behaviour with simulation characteristics of vehicles and pedestrians. 

However, if you get caught up in the small things like these, you knowingly take the fun away from the game. The designers and developers of C:S have done an astounding job, and most of the DLCs will not disappoint you. Hours of fun is no exaggeration. Go forth and build!"
20378,.
20379,a great game with many different options on how you wish your gaming experience to be. I recommend this game for anyone that likes to think.
20380,This game made me consider switching my major to civil engineering
20381,"funni
"
20382,"Cities: Skylines is one of those games that you can be as in-depth or basic as you want. It's a pretty fun way to lose track of many many hours building things for simulated people (Cims). With the use of thousands of mods/assets found in the Workshop, you can create some hyper realistic, well detailed cities/towns, or make a solid effort at starting a City, just to abandon it and start fresh on the next map you find. 

Overall, I definitely recommend this game, especially with mods."
20383,"Too complex with no real tutorials other than youtube. Nothing is polished so you need DLC and plenty of MODS like for building a round roundabout and you have to build a small road, then destroy it, so you can build a multilane road. I hate this game already..."
20384,"Cities Skylines is everything you wanted Sim City to be when you were a kid, and then some. The ability to manage just about everything, and the unlocking options to advance your city make the gameplay both satisfying, and addictive."
20385,very relaxing and fun!
20386,"Dream city building simulator for creative people. There is absolutely insane amount of assets in steam workshop that will make your cities look so realistic and detailed,that you will most likely lose yourself in this game for a long time."
20387,"A good mixture of simcity type city building with transport tycoon logistic mixed in for a perfect formula of city planning and economy simulation.  Traffic is the heart of the problem one has to tackle and the myriad of solutions is what makes this game fun.  It is very rewarding to see your city thriving.  You can also decide whether to go fully green or as polluting to your heart's content.  Lastly with the the ability to edit/mod/workshop, you can replicate your own city to see if you are better than the city planner that build your city!"
20388,"This game is awesome. Also has mod support so IF you get bored of it, you can extend the gameplay in so many ways it's unreal. You'll cease to exist for a long time if you start playing this."
20389,"A relaxing Sim.  You can get as creative as you want or get industrial with it (pun intended). I did get it on sale, and the DLC does make it an excellent package for my interests.  A well-made, fun game all around."
20390,I love it.
20391,"Cities Skyline is one of the many games that I wish Steam had a lukewarm option for. It's a fun city building game with a traffic focus. Much like any other city builder, the player is required to develop the city and balance traffic, education, health services, jobs, and housing for their citizens within a constant budget. The game has no real endgame beside the acquiring of achievements and the beautification and growth of one's city.

Pros: Its probably the most well known, developed city builder around. The game has a lot of options, and the cities can appear life like when done correctly.

Cons: The game hides most of the content behind overpriced and egregious amounts of DLC, Basic features of city development seem to have been rationed out to the consumer in DLC installments Many of the DLC's are weak in their offerings. A simple look at the long list of DLC filled with radio stations that add only background music to the game is proof of the developer's greed.

Even basic features like adjusting taxes and taking loans require the player to develop their city to reach the appropriate city population to unlock. Certain buildings and achievements in the game can only be obtained via DLC purchases or purposely sabotaging the city (for example, having certain natural disasters occur, having 2k abandoned buildings in the city, having a crime rate over 50% for years, etc.)

The water physics of the game are horrible and changing just one building on the waterfront can cause massive flooding throughout the city. I've lost hours of progress because the water decided to pull a tsunami after I fixed some riverfront properties. When deepening the middle of the river causes it to surge and flood rather than drain, the physics are broken.

Traffic AI is just as bad, and cars will routinely clump in one lane despite alternative lanes or routes to their destination. I've read this was done to prevent CPU overloads as the routes are determined upon the cars spawn for the most direct route. Unfortunately, this means the game will force you to either download user mods (which also prevents you from getting achievements) to correct or accept that every driver will use the one lane of your four lane highway. 

I have played the game a decent amount and routinely come back for a weekend or so of creativity via trial and error. I've purchased the base game for friends interested in city building. However, I do so as Cities Skylines is less of a great game, but an okay game with minimal competition. 

If you are a big fan of city builders and the game is on a deep sale, it could be a fair time sink, Just make sure to prepare yourself for all the issues I've explained above."
20392,recommend game
20393,The greatest city builder ever.
20394,The game is a well made.
20395,Yes
20396,"I haven't played this game a lot yet, but it seems fun! :)"
20397,"nice creative and fun, gets a bit boring so adding mods makes it better"
20398,"tl;dr: They should introduce a subscription model with a full game.

It's funny and engaging. But for me it's not that much fun beyond 30 hours, because lots of the interesting features are locked behind DLCs and I just stopped enjoying looking at my polluted city with terrible traffic. And I also don't enjoy dumping another $30-$40 for the additional content.

Recently, I've realized it's more fun to watch someone play it on YouTube with all the DLCs and some mods than playing it myself."
20399,good game to stalk people from bird eye view or crash bandicoot style
20400,I love how real the game is.
20401,it is a great game
20402,"Thanks to the excellent community contributing tons of mods and assets to the workshop, you have many different ways in which you can have tons of fun with this game!"
20403,"[h1] Cities Skylines is simply the best city building game out there! [/h1]
As a fan of all the SimCity games, I hated seeing the downfall of SimCity in 2013 but I was so grateful when this came out. No other game of this kind can compete with it.

[b] Pros: [/b] 
[b] 1. [/b] It is extremely detailed! Basically every logical thing was thought of and added by the developers. 
[b] 2. [/b] The graphics are pretty good. It's not very important for this kind of game; but still, it looks nice.
[b] 3. [/b] Map size is huge! You can spend over a hundred hours easily to build a single city. With mods, it's even bigger!
[b] 4. [/b] It comes included with a map, asset, theme, and scenario editor allowing you to easily create your own custom content. 
[b] 5. [/b] Modding support is simply the best! There are 10's of thousands of mods to pick from, allowing you to completely customize your city however you want, as well as adding new ways to play. 
6. The developers are continuing to support the game even after 6 years.

[b] Cons: [/b]
[b] 1. [/b] The game does require a beefy system to maintain playability. The larger your city becomes, the worse it gets. For myself, Playing with an RTX 3080, Ryzen 7 5800x and 32Gb of RAM, I get around 30fps in my city with 100k population. Optimization could definitely be better.
[b] 2. [/b]  There is a small amount of tutorials in game. Given it's great detail, it can take awhile for new players to learn how everything works. 
[b] 3. [/b] DLC's have gotten out of hand over the years. There are so many DLC's, that for new players it's hard to know which is even worth buying. Some of them are great and worth your consideration, others are just nearly useless and a waste of money. Not to mention, you can download mods that make some DLC worthless. It's 2021 so I suppose you can't expect much less then being flooded with more DLC to buy.

Overall, it's simply the best city building/city simulation game currently on the market. Given the nearly endless amount of mods, there is always ways to build your city better, bigger and more detailed. I highly recommend the game!! Your money will be well spent."
20404,"Not a bad game. I enjoy this game.
"
20405,bEST EVER
20406,"1. Build a road
2. Make houses by the road.
3. Make factories to make money.
4. Your people accidentaly drink sewage water,
5. Population decline
6. After 30 minutes resolving the problem you decide to flood the whole city,
7. Build a new city with a new industry and with a better sewage system.
8. Business is booming.
9. People are dumb.
10. You make them smart.
11. Now they are too smart.
12. After a hour of trying to resolve the problem you quit.
10/10 game would recommend."
20407,Good game for anyone who like builders and strategy games. A bit of a change of pace game from what Paradox makes but still just as good of quality overall great game. I would also consider checking out the workshop for this game as there is lots of content there as well.
20408,good city simulator game i like it
20409,Great game. Lots of ways to play it
20410,"Love City Sims. This one is like the best of both worlds, it has all the ease of use and functions as Sim City, but adds all the things I wish Sim City had. Only complaint is, there is no crosswalk path. You have to either change the road type for the section of road you want the crosswalk on, or just connect the walking paths to the crosswalks at intersections. Would like to be able to put crosswalks in the middle of a block (as I like to run walking paths between homes, much like they are in my real life city that I live in), without changing road type. Some of the modders have created crosswalks, like that, but it is for looks only, the Cims don't actually use it. Other than that one thing, it is everything I love about City Sims. So despite my one complaint, I would definitely recommend it to anyone who loves City Sims. I literally can play for hours on end, completely loosing track of time. So I give it 2 thumbs up."
20411,addictive
20412,yes
20413,Never really gets old thanks to its continued updates and mod support.
20414,"Unlike SimCity 2013 this game actually works. Ex. When you reconnect water, electricity, etc... it actually delivers it everywhere rather than sometimes only delivering electricity everywhere, other times not at all. I have yet to see an equivalent to Megatowers but I'm going to look at these: https://steamcommunity.com/workshop/browse/?appid=255710&searchtext=skyscrapers&childpublishedfileid=0&browsesort=trend&section=collections"
20415,I love that the detail is so amazing. I only wish it ran a bit faster on my older mac mini. I bought a dedicated Xbox just to play this game. Fabulous.
20416,""")"
20417,.
20418,"You run out of things to do after like 20 hours, like you city is maxed and you have functionally unlimited money and there's just nothing else to do. Maybe the DLCs fix this, I have a couple, but they don't seem to do much other than add micromanagement."
20419, Banger
20420,you idiodick people play this game now!!
20421,good game
20422,"addictive game. Traffic mod is mandatory, since car behavior and traffic priciples are dumb as fuck. Would recommend to everyone."
20423,"I started playing the game at 9pm, hopped off at 8:30pm 

"
20424,amazing
20425,Good sandbox city building game. A bit slow for older machines.
20426,My city died due to drinking contaminated water
20427,"I felt like I put crazy hours into this game. . . until I saw some others play times. I have only a few city builder games under my belt but Skylines hit the ""city builder"" nail on the head. If you are looking for a casual city builder that actually feels comfortable and doesn't bog down the user late game, this game is perfect. Experience your city's humble beginning's, to their eventual expansion into new territory where you must decide whether to drill for oil, farm, manufacture consumer goods, or build office districts in order to keep your new pops employed. Make sure to build schools so that your pops get the education they need to succeed. Take care of your pops with service buildings such as police stations, fire stations, hospitals, and many others. This is the only city builder I ever really stuck with and every so often can load up just to look at the huge city that sprawled from a single plot of land.
"
20428,great great game! coming from sim city this is thousands of times better in every way!
20429,Rabbit Hole
20430,"Admittedly I don't have all of the dlc so it's possible that some of them help with this but I find the game to be incredibly car centric. You can build an american style car-centric suburb and that is all you can build (especially initially).

It doesn't really allow you to make ""walkable"" cities or cyclist centric cities (you need a car road to even be able to build something for example so making a pedestrian street is basically impossible, or a park that you can walk to) and even with an incredibly well built out public transport network (and free tickets) very few people actually use public transportation. It's based on the typical North American view of city design and doesn't for example allow mixed housing and shop districts (like local cafes, resturants and shops) or if you try the citizens complain about noise. It's made to create car dependent suburbs (and cities) with stroads and trying to make anything else is very difficult.

It is however visually incredibly appealing, so I'm a bit ambivalent about the game despite the things I find frustrating about it."
20431,"So I bought this game it had a lot of positive feedback I know, I'm just gonna bullet point list all the positive things I feel about this game and bad things.
Bad
1: without the DLC's for this game unlocked there is nothing to do.
2: the DLC's are expensive for this game for what your getting out of them.
3: The Format of the standard game is very generic for being a game released after 2010.
4: the standard game content is also very limited.
5: sim city 4 was a better game too compare and is cheap, and old as dirt.
6: it just was not fun enough to make me want to buy DLC's.
7: the older cities titles have more content sadly and looks way better then this.
8: come taste the game for just 30$ and realize they are really trying to sell you DLC's more then sell you a game
pros about this game
1: there is a lot of DLC content if you can afford it to make this game content rich enough to be enjoyable.
2: I'm a huge fan of DLC content for sure."
20432,good game
20433,"pretty fuckin good

20434,This game is still fun to play after 6 years. I have all of the DLC. I'm looking forward to CS2
20435,yes
20436,good
20437,Good Game
20438,AMAZING! I can not wait to see CS2!
20439,I have been playing city builders since I was 11 when Sim City came out on the super Nintendo. I am now 40 years old and I would say this is the best more complete version of any city builder (Maybe other than sim city 4) that i have played in a long time. Great game and fun. So much to do and so many ways to build. I will never have enough time. I recommend this game.
20440,"City Skyline is a game where you can spend hundreds of hours. Here it's about building your city in your own way, place every single thing and fill it in no matter what it is. And then you have ads and an incredible amount of things that you can download from the workshop and insert into your city. Great fun game and is endless. Highly recommended"
20441,Bonsoir.
20442,Addictive as heck and very fun simple gameplay loops.
20443,you can use your imagination to make your own growing city! it's so much fun plus it has the steam workshop
20444,its a no no
20445,best city building game
20446,"The best city builder since SimCity 4. Too many DLC, however, vanilla Cities: Skylines will offer enough necessities to enjoy the game in its current state."
20447,"Best city builder ever created. I have played all since the very first simcity back in 90s. Get it, mod it, play it."

There are hundreds and hundreds, possibly into the thousands, who would pay $40 for that $180 bundle. DO THE MATH. Let more people enjoy this game while also making more."

20460,"Great sandbox game, if you have a fetish for planning and organising things, this is your jam"
20461,I enjoyed the game and the vast amount of mods.
20462,"Great game to spend some hours building, developing and detailing cities, mods enhance the gameplay and visuals a lot but can be very taxing on the GPU/CPU so be careful not to overload your game with mods if you dont own a powerful machine."

"
20471,fun
20472,"Don't get me wrong, the game is fun. Figuring out how to mitigate a deathwave is satisfying, but incredibly unrealistic. I've always enjoyed city builders and other management sims, and Cities: Skylines really does an alright job...

However, if you decide to look up a video of somebody who seems like they really know what they're doing, chances are the game is loaded with mods. I bout the game when it was on sale, and came with a couple DLC packs, was less than $15 so I couldn't complain. Then I looked at the DLC catalog, and saw the whopping (at the time, on sale) $200+ worth on offer. That is what I can't recommend. 

By the sheer lack of content compared to what is available, I have a hard time thinking Paradox didn't intentionally make the game and scale it back for release. Having that much DLC is possible, but considering it isn't a little extra for a side story, or here's some funny skins/textures to play with, it's literally the complete game. 

The current base game, without DLC is so stripped back compared to even older city builders, from the lack of tutorial, forced pollution of waterways, minimal landscaping tools, the list goes on... it feels like it's missing $200 of content that should have already been in a ""modern"" game."
20473,"I've never had a game immense me so deeply into it. Great fun, a game I could stay up all night playing."
20474,"Dis game very good
"
20475,"I've played a lot of Civilization over the last decade, but I'm a little different than a lot of other players in that the main draw of that series for me is not tactics, warfare, or strategic decision making but rather the zen like appreciation of seeing my cities grow and spread across the map, changing the landscape with my influence. I've asked a couple different people what game would be able to fulfill that desire for me, since Civ isn't really built for it, and the answer I get back most often is Cities Skylines. (Although if you have any suggestions for a game like what I described feel free to let me know.)

I was hesitant to get into Cities Skylines because the game has a really steep learning curve. It's also a little too realistic for my tastes I think. I don't necessarily want to actually learn about city planning in order to become an effective Cities Skylines player, but that's more of what it's geared towards.
That said though, there is an initial hump to get over when first starting to play Cities Skylines where you don't know how anything works and why your city is losing money/having catastrophes, and I started and stopped a few times before I got past that hump.
However, after you get past that initial learning curve, the game does somewhat become the game that I was hoping for, my city more or less grew on its own and it was more about managing its growth rather than dealing with stressful problems. However, the issue I think I have is that after 12 hours of gameplay I realized had kind of gotten to the point of where I could go with that level of gameplay and my skill with the game. If I wanted to keep going, I'd have to get past more difficulty humps of figuring out public transportation routes, and traffic management, and import/export economics. So, I think I'm deciding now, that while this is an amazing game, with a great deal of content with mods/DLC I've gotten what I wanted to out of it and I'm going to move onto the next thing.

I absolutely recommend this game though for anyone who feels like they enjoy city building enough to get past that initial hurdle and into the game proper. There is a particular type of gamer who enjoys things like Factorio and Satsifactory for whom this sort of gameplay is really appealing. Some people seem to get an almost sexual thrill out of traffic efficiency and planning out supply routes. For me though, I'm hoping for something a little bit more chill and fun, but I'd recommend this game to just about anyone who's interested."
20476,Hours of fun for creative minds.
20477,very good game
20478,"This is a great city painter. This is a bad traffic simulator. This is an awful city management game. 

Skylines is the current-reigning 3d city painter following the failure of EA's last Sim City game. Unfortunately, the simulation is shallow. Wealth is not simulated: you can't have poor, middle-class, or rich citizens. All buildings upgrade into the same-looking gentrified shiny apartments. Public services are very simple: citizens want a service, and you plop down buildings that provide that service. What little depth they have comes from the traffic management sim: the service needs to be accessible, so either citizens need to be able to get to the buildings in a timely fashion, or the buildings need to be able to send their vehicles out to various parts of town in a timely fashion. If traffic flow gets bad enough that this fails to happen, citizens get upset. All you need to have effective public services is enough capacity + traffic flow for your citizens to make use of them.

Some people think this isn't a traffic simulator. I'm wondering what those folks are smoking. Most of the work you put in has to be on roads, and there aren't really many city concerns to actually focus on. Occasionally you'll add more zones but then you're likely to be back on roads and transport again.

Mods are required to make the traffic simulation playable. Citizens cannot use lanes properly and frequently will back up the right-most lane. This problem is especially bad in a developing city, incentivizing players to pre-plan the entire city before laying the first zone. Roundabouts frequently glitch unless made with a prefab. Citizens will spend in-game months waiting for a single subway car instead of taking a faster pedestrian route. Cities must either be built around the pathfinding AI OR be built in a style similar to Houston, Texas to find success. This design decision is in conflict with the game's nature as a city painter and I frequently see posts by people expressing frustration at the game's traffic simulation to the point of dropping the game entirely.  

I can't recommend this game for anyone who actually wants to manage a city. I can't recommend it to someone who wants to paint a city. I can only recommend it to folks heavily invested in traffic AI if they are playing on PC and want to download different traffic mods."
20479,"it wont let me onto a city or map

20480,Very addictive game - much more fun with mods and dlcs

20485,City Pog
20486,Awesome game... not the best Grapichs.... CIties XL Platinium has betetr grapichs and mechanics..... But at least Skylines offer better  overrall performance.... But still lack Multi core support...and i hate when buidings upgraded with no reason and have not enough educated workers.
20487,"Fun game, you can put many hours into it before it ultimately crashes (when using a lot of workshop items). I don't play games that much anymore but I am looking forward to a succesor of this one with upgraded graphics (realism please) and other features and enhancements towards realism."

20493,The Best City Creator I Have Seen
20494,"If you are looking to scratch that Sim City itch but were sorely disappointed by EA's lackluster sequel, head on into Cities Skylines. It has everything you would ever need in a city sim, and if you can't find it in the default game, the community has created thousands of mods for your convenience! Each DLC adds awesome unique buildings like trams and monorails and even fishing! You have many resources at your disposal, including the basic police, fire, and health systems... but make sure you allow them easy access into your high density areas or prepare for lot's of dead cims!"
20495,"Unlike so many other city management games, the cities you create in Cities Skylines seem to have actual... life. From the many ways in which you can customize your cities to exactly your liking to the people who inhabit your city and use your public transportation systems, work in your office areas, live in your residential areas, and can be followed around as they complete their daily tasks, the game does a fantastic job of making you feel attached to your creations. It always feels like there's something more to do, progress to be made, buildings to be built. Especially when you factor in the game's vibrant modding community, it's a thoroughly engrossing experience that is sure to see you sink hours into it at a time."
20496,"I think all the good has been said, so I will only say the bad things.

1. This is a massive game that takes alot of time and patience. It can even take years to build and slowly perfect your city. And worst of all, you can never seems to get the city to look the way you want. I am still struggling after all these time.... So, I will say just go slowly and don't rush. Don't try to look like those your seen in youtube right from the start. 

2. Cost.... Literally the most expensive game I have played. Expensive as in the expansion packs/DLC etc.... Don't need to buy all of them at once. Just start with the standard and slowly addon if you want.... 

3. Alot of materials and guides available and it can be overwhelming esp. for new players. Don't try to read and digest all of them... just go slowly. 

4. Time and patience (like no.1). I gave up several times. If you feel bored, frustrated etc... just save the game and come back later

ok, thats some downside of this game and some tips."
20497,This is the best game!  I literally get lost in it at time. Go to youtube there are so many great people there whom can give you pointers. My ALL TIME favorite game.
20498,"its the best city builder, its got the biggest workshop community ive seen, and paradox keep modernising the game with dlc. overall just a really good game."
20499,great game to relax and meditate
20500,Great Game
20501,"Old engine, rampant with memory issues. Particularly if you like to use mods.  It's so hard to keep track of which mods you need and which ones just are taking up memory space. Seriously guys. How long is it going to be before you update the game engine? I've tried to build the same city from the ground up only to have the file corrupt and break resulting in me losing all the time and progress I made, making the game in the half broken state unplayable even with good hardware. But still kicks the crap out of Sim City."
20502,Launch Cities Skyline to enjoy relaxing atmosphere. Proceed to get stress because of the traffic jam
20503,city
20504,good game very addicting though easy to lose track of time
20505,"I've put about 1,000 hours into this game and still can not get enough of it! If your like me and grew up on SimCity then this is it..... but better."
20506,"A very creative and absorbing game, holding one of the most expansive mod communities on Steam which virtually allows you to design intricately. Does have some persistent bugs and can be frustrating to play, but would definitely recommend as one of the best city building games."

20510,"Cities: Skylines (better known as Traffic: Jams) is a city planning simulator where you spend hours designing pretty intersections and city districts which work awfully wrong.

This game is a time waste sinkhole, honestly. When playing in the normal mode, your only goal is to grow the population of your city to unlock cool buildings. To do that, you draw roads and designate zoning for commerce, industry and residential areas and provide them with electricity, water and services such as fire station and police headquarters. Once reaching a certain threshold, you unlock further buildings. Nuclear power plant? Not before you reach 40,000 people, my friend!

The simulation aspects of C:S are very soft. Inhabitants need industries to work, industries need commerce to sell their good, commerce needs inhabitants to buy their stuff. It forms a cycle and that's it. Industries pollute so you wanna keep them away from your residential areas, but you'll have to be prepared to see their trucks going back and forth to the commercial areas. Your inhabitants will also use cars to get to places and that can create a true chaos if you don't plan it correctly. They also use greedy algorithms (i.e. take shortest path) which is a key ingredient for traffic jams. The vehicles' AI don't know how to properly use lanes which is quite frustrating. Luckily, there are mods which allow better control of those things.

Don't complain about traffic jam in C:S though, because if you do, someone will knock on your door to spread the word of the Road Hierarchy Theory and Proper Intersections Design [spoiler]which is much simpler than they believe and just half-solves the problems in C:S.[/spoiler]

The amount of cool mods is astonishing. The game also allows you to create custom assets from your own 3d models. I frankly spent more time in the assets editor than in the game itself!

The achievements are also much easier than they look. Playing with mods disable achievements and most of the community do not hunt them anyway. Some of the 0.2% achievements can be literally obtained in 5min. The only headache-inducing ones are: 
- ""What the..."" requires a very random event, see here how to unlock it: https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2579860592
- ""1001 Nights"" requires playing the game for several lifetimes; the best way to get it is to let an empty city idling 24h a day for 7~10 days,  depending on your system.
Linux port was also perfect, thanks for supporting the penguin!"

20531,This game is fun
20532,soooo many human right violations
20533,best game ever
20534,"city managin', baby"
20535,.
20536,Only game i can really compare this to is Sim City and Cities Skylines is definitely the better of the two. I think the only thing the game is really missing is more of a grind whether it be early or late save. I feel they could do some form of a campaign and add an RPG element to it as a mayor or something. Some scenario campaigns like fixing downturn cities etc is an area they really need to explore. If you like any form of City Building/Base building games then this is definitely one to try.
20537,GG
20538,Not worth the cost.
20539,"Good city building game, even better with mods"
20540,"An extremely fun and immersive game about watching your city grow one milestone at a time. You get to manage the many different systems and services in which your city needs to operate properly. The base game with DLC is good in its own right. But it would be a crime not to mention the amazing modding community this game has. An endless amount of custom assets, road networks, parks, trees, vegetation as well as other improvement of life mods. Seriously, every time I glance at the workshop I find something I just have to subscribe to, keep up the good work modders!! Anyway, would definitely recommend you pick this one up."
20541,"spent 100 bucks just to see that the game it's out-smarting me and i can't get the money back anymore cuz im dumb and i forgot to do that :D

20549,"Very fun, easy to learn, great performance, and allows creativity. A lot will need to be spent on additional features (around $125 for the ""Big DLC's"", excluding Content Creator Packs and Radio Packs). Remote Play/Multiplayer support would be awesome to allow multiple people to collaborate on a single city at once though. Definitely worth the money, if you have around $200 to spend though..."
20550,"It's awesome.. But Once you get into downloading assets just know that you'll suddenly be waiting ages for the game to load and it will occasionally crash, But there's no comparison between that and the vanilla game.  So there's the issue."
20551,"Gonna be honest, this game is hard as hell at the start and midway (if your very new to the game.) but once you get the hang of it this game becomes fun FAST, great destruction, hella good for diversity sure dlc is kinda expensive but its not as  bad as EA, Or any of the other companies that cause the same crap,  but if you want a game thats VERY calming this is a high recommendation! Also.. get a good pc if you're going to mod this, but auh.. yeah!

10/10 best city building sim!  (i've wasted enough time to tell you that.. cheats with this is very nice when building a city YOU""LL BE ADDICTED TO THIS AND I PROMISE YOU ITS FUN )"
20552,i just find it calming but then i just spawn a tsunami
20553,It still kinda amazes me how addicting it can be to plan endless city blocks and lay roads to connect them. Not to mention planning public transit networks and making sure garbage trucks and snow plows are adequately distributed around the city. 5/5 would buy again.
20554,"It's just plain fun. Why you gotta have a reason all the time? What you want me to tell you how it's easy to play? OR Easy to mod? How it's very satisfying to be able to build your own home town or just make up one of your own? Well, no, I'm not going to tell you all of these things. Play it for yourself and see."

20564,"This is a very fun and entertaining game. I found the learning curve a little steep, but not too bad. One can manage or micromanage as desired. The graphics are spectacular and the game play is fairly realistic. I also found the DLCs offered, while not necessary, to be wonderful enhancements to the the game. I would recommend this game to anyone looking for a nice relaxing game."

20567,Fun game
20568,"This game is so much fun!! I don't play it seriously, I just turn on the 'unlimited money' and 'unlock all structure' cheats and build cities in what is basically sandbox mode. Super fun and relaxing."

20574,"Has a few flaws, but it is by far the best city builder on the market."
20575,Best city building game. Lots of features. Nice challenges to handle.
20576,It does what it says it will.
20577,yes
20578,"I've played this multiple consoles. Can say I recommend to anyone who gains satisfaction from efficiency, based things!"
20579,it fun
20580,"The game is grate.  I use to play on P.S 4 and keep wishing that they would add the Steam work shop to the P.S 4 but they never did, that's my only complaint. Besides from when you can literally see through the world, the water goes bananas and the texture s t r e t c h e s. But besides from that. The game is amazing, The graphics, (not for the people though) the creativity you can have, and every other feature you could have except for controlling were your roads can go (please fix that.) And I'm going to end it on this  Its a Grate game for creative people."
20581,This is an amazing game as if you are interested in city building games this is the best game i have bought!
20582,"Here's the thing about cities skylines, before I continue I want to say that, yes I do like this game. I love urban planning and city development, in fact it was this game that inspired me to go into college for urban development/planning. Now I know that might seem a little confusing since I said no I wouldn't recommend this game. And it's true I wouldn't recommend this game for one very simple reason, the massive paywalls. Back before all the DLCs, when the game was relativity new, I got this game on my Xbox one and then on my PC. It didn't have all the maps it does now but it didn't have excessive DLCs like it has now. Many new players after already paying $30 for the game or $40 on Xbox might find themselves a little miffed at the fact that almost 2/3 of the game's content is locked behind a paywall. Yes I bought the DLCs because I do enjoy this game, but the fact that I have to pay $15 more just to get a certain section of the game is dumbfounding to me. If you want everything the game has to offer you have to be prepared to drop $177 if not more just to unlock the full game. And I wouldn't put it pass the developers of this game to make that $177 mark go up to over $200+. The Sunset harbor DLC I got on my Xbox and I liked it but in no way was it worth paying $15 for it. I could of just bought an indie game for $15 and have been more satisfied playing that than having bought the Sunset Harbor DLC. It comes back to the fact that you will get a very basic Vanilla version of the game unless you're willing to pay over $100 for the rest of the game. I do like this game but the fact that they locked all this content behind a paywall is nothing but upsetting and irritating, especially since very few people are going to spend that much money on one game while they can spend it on four other games. Or in a lot of cases now, many people can't simply afford to unlock the rest of the game."
20583,I am a long-time fan of the city simulation games and was super happy I found this one.  Cities Skyline has many features I was familiar with but implemented so much better.  The graphics are the most impressive that I feel like I am part of the action and really get to know the character of my city.  I am just starting to learn some nuances that will make be a better city manager in time.  This game is a home run!
20584,This game is amazing
20585,"yes, very good i get all crad and very pro
"
20586,"Cities: Skylines is the perfect successor to the SimCity franchise. I've been playing on and off since launch, and it remains my favorite modern city-builder."
20587,"No, I only played this game for 572 hours because its horrible, I'm just kidding why would you ask me that? Of course I love this game. This is the spiritual successor to the SimCity franchise that SimCity 2013 failed to be. The developers picked up where EA/Maxis dropped the ball, it is a consolation for city builder fans everywhere.

The attention to detail in this game is highly appreciated, you can choose between finish resources for industry, infinite sandbox, you can even pick what side of the road your citizens drive on. Traffic algorithms almost add a puzzle element to this game. Citizens feel tangible, like they lead real lives as they move from place to place. This game has incredible community mod support via Steam Workshop, there is enough content to keep you micromanaging all your systems and customizing your cities for 572 hours. Well at least in this humble gamer's opinion."

20602,"This game so far has been very investing.
It has so much more potential and to offer in terms of content, such as a politics DLC.
So far, I am very satisfied of what this game has delivered and, especially to all the modders who have now created even more tools and addons in this game to make it even better.

Sincerely,

20610,perfect game!!!
20611,i love this game
20612,"I'll keep it short.. I used to not want to try this game because I thought Sim City franchise was better. I was a Sim City Puritan, even when they released their last Sim City (which was pleasing to look at, nice to play for most part but very limited in capacity tbh). It took me few years after released of this game to get into it, with all the DLCs, Content Creator packs (Which is a great initiative, kudos to Paradox for introducing and allowing this) and I am blown away with how wonderful this game is, and how difficult and challenging it can be too. I love the dynamics of the game with everything that we do down to the granule decisions and implication that comes with it. I have no complain tbh, I wish for more contents though. More is good!

I really was thinking if would be great if yall could come up with some political systems to this game.. that would be groundbreaking. Socialism, Capitalism, etc. and see how it affects city building and the people's reactions."
20613,"If you like being particular about things, this is the game for you!"
20614,NOice
20615,amazing
20616,"Time absorbing and a fun game, even if sometimes the DLC seems to not fully work with the main game. ="

20633,yes
20634,10/10
20635,Cities and Skylines
20636,"Read before Buying! 
4/10 Points without DLCs (dont buy)
7/10 Points with DLCs (very good)
9/10 Points with DLCs and Mods (awsome)

To be honest, the main Game itself is really boring and is missing a lot. It feels incomplete on so many things and don't makes really fun. I builded up a city and unlocked the most things in under 8 hour playtime. There was no solution for stuff what really annoyed me. (like a full wastewater treatment), no nice decorations and i missed a real industry complex,  many city Buildings. a real harbor etc.etc. 

However, together with the big DLCs, the game reaches its full potential and becomes a complete other Game.
DLCs like Industries, Parklife, After Dark,  Sunset Harbor, Green Cities, Campus, Snowfall.
(Natural disaster dlc is for a special kind of people, so i dont recommend it for everyone) 

So i only recommend the Game for you, if you are also ready to buy the most importand DLCs. 
If you buy it on Steam, it can get really expensive. So i recommend to wait for a Sale or buy the Keys elsewhere.

Edit: Some Mods for this game are aswome and some are essential for me. 
(better graphics, more traffic options etc.)

This Game dont get 10/10 for me, because you need to buy many DLCs and install some importand mods which should be in the main game.

Cheers

20637,"As a faithful Simcity-er, who only recently got sick of SC4 crashing on me...I picked this game up with a number of the expansions (Mass Transit and Train Stations) and truly...WOW! It has some really pleasing mechanics, very expansive city possibilities, a great mod community (and overall community, of course), and I would keep adding more...but I want to go play now :)

Doubters: Give it a solid chance; read about how to zone, use roads...the basics just to acclimate a bit faster. It will be worth your time!"

20641,Best city builder game on the market for now. Even though the game feels a bit dated in terms of visual.
20642,"While this game is clearly top-notch, I have to give it a negative review because the system requirements for Linux listed on this page are well short of what you should be running to avoid crashes and bugs. With 8GB of RAM (exceeding the Recommended level by 2GB) my game regularly crashes from lack of memory--a more accurate minimum would be between 12-16GB from what I can tell from other players' experiences. Linux is obviously not the primary platform that most developers worry about, but I'm running Ubuntu--hardly an obscure distro. 

Paradox are hard-working developers and it's excellent that they support Linux at all, but until they're clearer with players about the system requirements for this particular game, it'll be very frustrating for the Linux audience to actually access and play it, and that's a shame, because if I could play it I would love this one."
20643,aight

20661,:-)
20662,"This games takes some getting used to. I bought it 2 times, and refunded it after 30 minutes due to not knowing the game mechanics. About 1.5 years later, I bought it again because I wanted a city builder. Since that time, which has been about a week, I have played 28 hours. The ability to create a city with districts and processing is amazing, and OVERWHELMINGLY SATISFYING. Would HIGHLY recommend."
20663,Absolute masterpiece. Keep coming back every time i have some time to play. Community is amazing and so creative

20673,"Pretty good, free dlcs would be nice."
20674,I really like the freedom and choice you have in this game. I am a very detailed oriented person and I LOVE all the little details in this game like the specific families and names. I'm definitely an avid player of this game and highly recommend it.

20678,pretty good game a steal with 30 bucks but some mechanics that a lot of players say are core mechanics are locked behind a paywall making it a 60 dollar game i would recommend getting the new player bundle as for what i got.
20679,game shit
20680,very good very nice yes
20681,Engaging and absorbing
20682,PIcked up this game awhile ago.  First try didn't capture and I was distracted.  So far loving it!  More I play it the more I get that Sim City feel.
20683,^
20684,"Why Is This Available I Don't Even Have The Game
(it's good i know from my friend's recommendation)"
20685,"Hands down the best city builder around.

Be careful when buying the DLCs, cause a bunch of them are just music."
20686,"After a long pause I decided to come back. What a great game this is. Mods and features galore, and I really am enjoying playing it. The game is so relaxing to me that I tend to do it for hours on end. It's addictive, but in the best way possible. I do recommend this game, to everyone!"
20687,Its Fun
20688,it . . . AMAZING!!!!!
20689,GREATEST CITY-BUILDING SIM OF ALL TIME
20690,...
20691,"The spiritual successor to SimCity 4. That's the long and short of it. If that statement means something to you, then yes, you owe it to yourself to play this game."
20692,"The ""Traffic-jam Line"""
20693,"very fun game
"
20694,"This game is out of this world with amazing features an exiting game-play from crazy online personalities to the developers themselves! At the moment i have played this game for a total of 146 full hours and i am completely hooked and addicted to this lovely, amazing, pleasant to the naked eye and most importantly worth the price. You definitely should buy this game if you want to."
20695,Good
20696,Incredible with mods; pretty good without.
20697,"current build seems to not allow demolishing of roads. Aside from that, the focus on roads as the only way to zone; to let people to traverse the city is severely limiting. boring to only allow paved roads as public zoning space. The buildable region does not entertain me as its so small; feels very similar in scope to that of sim city 4 in (a super tight area to build in) except this time you cannot develop a region of cities,"
20698,If you like building cities it is the best way to do so!
20699,Such a great game. By playing it I found out how much I love this genre. I will keep playing this over the years.
20700,"I love this Game! I have all the DLC, Just a few creator packs but I really would love some additional DLC

Add a Movie/video production DLC...
So that we can do like movie premieres at Movie theatres - Film Festivals, build production studios, Film sets and add film and television museums. News Helicopters

Add a High Roller pack where you have like upmarket hotels, Boxing/ MMA/ wrestling arenas, Casino's.

Add a Sports Pack where you can have speedways, formula one racing, horse racing, Cricket stadums,

Additionally I reckon the Population Milestones a fairly low. I would prefer to double the total in game population size and add milestones to every 50k beyond the last one.

Plus better airports, airfields."
20701,High learning curve. Infinite playtime available.
20702,"Without a doubt, the best city building game out there. You only need to take a look on Youtube for the possibilities and creative flexibility this game provides. DLCs expand upon the functionality and the modding community is very strong. Definitely a game made for spending hours of your time building and tweaking a city, so not a game for all. This game does require a pretty beefy computer to run well, especially with mods. That being said, I pretty much built a pc to run this game."
20703,Um somehow I have the underground train station but I dont have the tunels?? help?
20704,plae
20705,i rather build cities than build a family
20706,"yes











damn 87 pages of mods in my folder?"
20707,This is a great game. it is a lot of fun. The vanilla maps are good and the modding communities are insane. There is hours of fun to be had on this game.  And with the right mods you can satisfy all your city/town planning needs.
20708,"To buy the full game, is 200 euro.    5/10

Score is purely because of this cash grab, no other reason, and i do still recommend the game (provided you know it will probably cost you more than the stated price if there is a feature/asset you'd like to add to game)

Its a fantastic game that has been brought down by drip-fed content that should be either put up as a library of assets/features you can choose from instead of packs, or added to the game for free.

To buy the full game is TEN TIMES the price advertised here on Steam for the base game."
20709,It is a great game.
20710,Best city builder game on steam
20711,no
20712,"10/10 autism sandbox, once you start getting custom assets you'll be spending 4-5 hours just detailing one small neighborhood"
20713,"The standardbearer for the genre. Modding is incredibly complicated, but the game is appealing even without mods.

Get it on sale with the expansions. It is worth playing."
20714,
20715,"This game is dope but wait for a crazy sale or get the keys froma website at a better price, because $ 200+ for all the expensions is absolutely insane.
Be sure to check the mods out on the workshop as i feel some of them are highly necessary like the ""move it"" or whatever its called mod.

good game"
20716,farts
20717,really really love this game cant stop playing it
20718,
20719,"I liked this game at first but it crashes so much i had uninstalled
"
20720,"I can't help but compare this to the Sim City games. Cities: Skylines is a great game it has its pros and cons, wish it feels like theres something missing in the gameplay and im not sure what it is yet."
20721,"The game is great - it really tests creativity and offers a relaxing and enjoyable experience that is unmatched by any other game I have played. Mods take it to the next level - you can spend ages on single details like intersections. I highly recommend this game, especially with mods as the devs have done a great job at leaving it open to the community and there are some really cool things in the Workshop."
20722,The city builder Simcity once was at its time and failed to be today.
20723,I forgot what time it was.
20724,It is not worth 27.99€ and the walkthrough is the worst.

20734,"Fun, chill game. Lots of cool mods and DLCs available to enhance it further."
20735,.
20736,bom e legal
20737,"This game is both fun with and without mods. Even the base game there is a lot to explore and create with. You can go from pure mechanics or just have fun and paint you some roads and see what happens. I went from sim city type enthusiast to civil engineer and city planner amateur hobbyist. Road hierarchy? If you don't know, you will after sinking the hours into this game. Traffic patterns, what is a substation, how to read a height map?! ALL THIS COULD BE YOUR NEW FIXATION!"
20738,ate but makes you feel so stupid at times
20739,"This is one of those times where I really wish ""It depends"" is a response I can give for whether or not I recommend a game.

PROS:
-Art direction/animation is pretty good. It sits somewhere between trying too hard to look real and trying too hard to NOT look real. (this made more sense in my head before I typed it out)
-Steam Workshop support is so total that you can control factors you wouldn't even notice if you only experience the base game. In fact, this is one of the first times that I would recommend a game almost completely for its modding community.

CONS:
-Bearing in mind this can be fixed with mods, it's quite easy to be overstimulated or overwhelmed by the sheer amount of T H I N G S happening at the same time.
-Mods can cause extra problems, and that's true for pretty much any game that has an active modding community. There will be a lot of time spent fiddling with settings, exiting and restarting, and browsing the Steam Workshop compared to actually [playing] the game.

Overall, if you want a game that you can experiment with on a deep level, and if you like sandbox games, this will suffice just fine."
20740,"addictive game, good to get your brain thinking on how to control your city

20741,"Good game for planners,"
20742,"GREAT GAME FUN

20756,its good
20757,Yes. More will follow. When permitted.
20758,The game is super therapeutic at least for me. I love the fact that it has so many things even without the expansion pack. I would recommend for those who love a relaxing game!
20759,"Great Game, love all the mods"
20760,very nice
20761,gud
20762,Very addictive and can see myself playing for hundreds of hours easy. 100% Recommend
20763,reminds me of sim city. It is a nice game
20764,Nice game
20765,"...
"
20766,"This game is so smooth and chill... you can really dive into it for hours!
In my case for example.. I use to put some nice music and start being creative. 

If you ever played sim city, then you know whats waiting for you, just 10 times better!
And if you like to modify some stuff ingame, just visit the workshop. There are tons of mods.

Totally recommend this game!!! It's worth every penny!

I used to play it too much in the past, so I had to deinstall it. But when I feel a lack of creativity I reinstall it.
It has a special place in my gamer heart <3 that's for sure.
"
20767,I love this game. There is so much you can do.
20768,Its good
20769,"This game is fun, not only are the vanilla buildings detailed, There's also a wide variety of buildings from real life, Such as the Ryugyong Hotel, Reichstag, And the aquarium in Osaka, Overall this is a really fun and immersive game, I'd rate it a 10/10!"

"
20775,"This game can be really really fun. I only have the base game and after a couple ""failed"" startup cities, it finally clicked and time blew away. Some issues are solved with mods. Need to have mods. There are a couple DLC's I haven't wanted to buy but haven't done it yet. I recommend this game"

When I realised how terrible the DLCs were, my second child had to say bye to me and hello to his new owners to pay for my psychological therapist.

20786,"I absolutely love this game! It's so realistic and I got in the sale for about £5 so it was an absolute bargain. I would without a doubt recommend this game to people, even the basic game without DLCs is brilliant."
20787,"This game will take up most of your time if you are into city building strategy games. If you are into the SimCity franchise, this will be a great replacement for you. It is not exactly the same as SimCity but you will figure it out eventually."
20788,"A little overwhelming at first, but an extremely immersive and detailed Sim. Easy to lose hours playing this game!"
20789,GG
20790,"Pro:
Most complete sim city like citybuilder IMHO
good expandability through mods

Cons:
Medium to large cities are laggy (due to the game being a somewhat older unity game)"

20801,"In all honesty, I only really got into this game after racking up about 150 hours and watching lectures on road hierarchy and city planning theory. If you spend the time to learn, it really is a wonderful game.

DLC is kinda scam tho lowkey dont buy unless u rly invested in the game"
20802,pousaihdfpouihas dpouifhsd
20803,Very similar to Sim City
20804,"The pinnacle of city building games, took the mantle from Sim City and isn't letting go anytime soon."
20805,I liked this game because it is intriguing and if you don't go bankrupt is vary fun and I could play for a long time
20806,"I'm into city-builder game -> I love this game. Yet, don't know how to deal with the electricity stuffs 4 real :("
20807,"564 hours in, I remember that I can write reviews.

This is what SimCity wanted to be when it grew up.
Thinking about titles like Surviving Mars? Skip em. They're not NEARLY as well put-together as this title.

The only issue I take with this game is the same I take with many other games that host an active modding community - it's exceptionally disingenuous to rely on your modders to fix broken aspects of your games.

Immediately download the traffic management mods, because you'll need them.

Recommended conditionally."
20808,"10/10 gameplay, totally reccomend"
20809,the game is great!
20810,Best traffic simulator out there!
20811,great game!
20812,"I'm 500 hours in and finally I've figured out how to construct a city that I'm comfortable sharing with other players.  Normally my cities are met with terrible disasters.  Its normally like the plot of ""2012"" except there's no mountain retreat containing huge arks to save my people."

20816,Best city builder ever!!!
20817,Great city builder totally worth it.  Out for a few years and still the best in the market IMO.
20818,gud gme
20819,really a good game
20820,"I started playing this on my Switch... which was a mistake. I found it to be ugly and hard to navigate the controls. I stuck with it, and started to realize why this game has such an amazing fan following. Something clicked and I thought... ""I have to get this on my PC."" I'm SO glad that I did. It's a beautiful game that is a relaxing as it is challenging, incredible."
20821,"relaxing, and non stressful if you know the basics. But, if you want it to be more stressful or complicated the mods will help you with that!"
20822,"Pretty good, made me develop OCD"
20823,"Traffic Management Simulator

Seriously though, the traffic [b]is hella important[/b].
Everything that connects with a road will need a path to and from a destination. Every time you see your traffic flow decreases, it hurts the city. Garbage piles up, people can't get to work, industries cannot bring goods to commercial buildings, emergency vehicles can't deal with emergencies, etc etc.

This game does such a good job at simulating these traffic flow that sometimes you spend 90% of your time managing your traffic. The learning curve is steep, so prepare to take [b]a lot[/b] of your time learning the ropes.

Also, despite being really good at simulating the macro traffic, the micro traffic is horrible. Mods such as Traffic Manager: President Edition will make the game [b]so much better[/b] at managing your micro traffic. In my opinion, this should've come with the game.
It's still playable without mods though. I personally play without mods. I think it has its own charms and difficulties without it.

TL;DR: Game good. Macro Traffic good. Micro Traffic needs Mods."
20824,Love it. For me it is relaxing it at the end of the day.
20825,How have I not given this a recommendation yet? DAYUM

20827,they still haven't figure out what a #dead #body smells like :P
20828,"This game is my heart and soul. I would totally recommend this game to anyone that loves city builders as much as i do. The game has so much replay ability that i can make a city and if it fails i just try again on a new map or with new aspects affecting the game play. (Cities 2 please!!) NOTE: The modding community is insane for this game and has helped me make cities i like even more because of that 

Thanks for reading my review!
                               ConnerRudi"
20829,This game is half doing stuff and half playing whack a mole with the abandoned buildings.
20830,guys i have played this game for 1000 hours!! this game is literally worth it!!!
20831,just awesome
20832,"I saw someone saying vanilla without DLC's is worth it even at full price so I got in with 75% discount... It's not. Pretty dull, zero replayability. Not buying any DLC's from Paradox on principle. Good value with 75% discount though. Must be good for kids (developing planning, imagination etc). Would recommend for this reason if not DLC's and launcher.

For adults recommending full-priced Factorio."
20833,Best modern human killer.
20834,good game
20835,"Good City builder, also not too difficult for beginners.
"
20836,"The game is fun, but as soon as your city gets a size of a few thousand inhabitants, the game closes itself as soon as you unpause after load and makes it impossible to continue."
20837,"Love the game, but !, unless  you have a powerful computer system then the slow  load will put many off."
20838,Great game but needs a lot of processing power with mods
20839,"i provide my citizens the same water that they expelled.

we do a little bit of trolling ( ͡ ͜ʖ ͡ )"
20840,"I was stuck on Simcity 4 for years. Was hard to let a classic go, but this is the best there is right now. Can totally recommend if you're into city building. The awesome workshop just makes it even better."
20841,"If you like designing things and managing them, this is for you!"
20842,yes i love big time
20843,Cities Skylines is a great game to play. With the added mods and assets made it look so real. I hope if the next cities Skylines comes out it can corporate a lot of the mods and assets into the game. Great work guys!
20844,"I enjoy the ability to build your own city, however the game is very complex."
20845,This is the best city builder simulation game on steam period. Although if you have enough items subscribed on the steam workshop it can take even longer than Gta 5 to get into your game. So it could do with some optimisation for sure although still great fun and the launcher has better terms of service than most social media sites do so don't even worry about it :)
20846,Nice game
20847,Unless you're willing to spend 300+ dollars don't bother. The base game without the 300+ dollars of DLC is an empty sad shell of a game.
20848,very cool game. Would recommend. Fuck Paradox and their shitty launcher just to collect data tho.
20849,"This game is way more in-depth and thought out than I though imaginable. You could play for hours, take breaks!"
20850,"Good game, great graphics. Needs lots of RAM to run smooth. On 8GB it will still be slow."
20851,
20852,"uh yeah it good, spent like 60 hours drawing city maps out before building in game"
20853,love it best game ever
20854,this game suckcs
20855,"Damn this is amazing ! 
worth the time u spend on it."
20856,highly recommend this game its tons of fun specially with custom assets and mods just be warned you'll need a powerful system to load lots of assets as unity don't manage resources very well other then that its fairly fun and i highly recommend it
20857,Simcity but better.
20858,Worth every second of the day to play!

20861,si moi bien
20862,Yes
20863,"One of my favorite ways to de-stress is to get on this game and get criticized by my residents for my sub-par mayoral abilities. Screw you Dennis, you expect me to tax you under 13% but you also wanna complain that there's nothing to do in town? You're lucky you have adequate healthcare in this economy.

10/10 would recommend."
20864,Been playing for like 7 years.  Love it and all the DLC's that have come out so far.
20865,"I guess after 200 hours i owe this game a review.

So in short, it's the best city builder there is. Nothing more to say, you probably already own this game if you like this Genre anyway."

20883,As I've played about 1268 Hours for this game. Yes it's one that I'd highly recommend. If you like city building games. I have all of the DLC and a few mods from the workshop. Very enjoyable game.
20884,"I absolutely love this game. If you like building and managing things, absolutely buy it. I have not been bored yet"
20885,"good time killer, fun to make realistic cities"
20886,This certainly is a game...
20887,good
20888,"If you like a city-building simulation game, then this one is for you. Otherwise, you can skip it altogether. Simple as that."
20889,"Is This Game Worth It?
If you like city builders or are into simulation games / strategy games, this game was worth it six years ago in 2015. I wouldn't recommend it at full price, and not without quality of life mods found in Steam workshop for the PC version. Lord help you if you're on console without mods. Things that should be simple are impossible. Things that should be a given from the start are locked behind milestones. It offers gameplay challenge, but it doesn't make sense. However, don't get me wrong: this game IS a functioning game, and it's not bad by any stretch of the word. I just don't think it's what you might be hoping for.

Graphics
On it's own, the game graphics run fine but are sad, drab and tacky, if that's something you care about. This can be changed with Steam Workshop assets/themes, but just not nice to look at on it's own. Even if you don't care about graphics at all, I use no mods or assets and I still get graphical glitches with roads and terrain, and my computer specs are more than capable of running this game nicely.

Gameplay
As a simulation/builder, it's challenging enough,  but once you learn the basic game mechanics, it's very arbitrary. Things that you need to develop the town are unlocked at stages that are dependent on how many people you have living in your city, ""parks"" from parklife and ""Industry"" from the industry DLC and ""campuses"" from that college/university pack all function roughly the same and just affect different aspects of your town's needs. There's SOME semblance of natural progression, like there is a bit of influence from the game that helps you naturally build your city... but you are almost always in full creative control. There's nothing really to guide you or wildcards to surprise you. And while it tries to be flexible with representing different cultures, it very much feels like an American City Simulator. My BIGGEST critique on gameplay is there winter DLC. This game has been out since 2015, and they never implemented changing seasons in gameplay. They have a new world type you can start a new map/city in so you can deal with winter and cold weather... FOREVER, but you don't have dynamic changing seasons or corresponding weather. Tourists just magically show up whenever they want, regardless if it would make sense. No summer vacations or Winter Holidays. Your residents are working 24/7 all the time.

User Friendly
The game also does a god-awful job of explaining anything to you. You're given ""tips"" but you're not taught how to build a city that functions well, you're not given a walk-through scenario to teach you different ways to start and support a functioning city. The game doesn't explain road hierarchy, how traffic works, or anything like that. I had to look up so many tutorials on youtube just to understand basic things.

Traffic and Resident AI
It's bad. Just so bad. I had a gravel road (30 mph I think? One of the slowest?) connecting two neighborhoods together, because i wanted residents to be able to have a short cut. There was a 40 mph main road with a round a bout in the middle for the people going to work between two different industry zones, and to the exit out of the city. Trucks and garbage collectors ended up gallivanting through both neighborhoods, using the slow dirt road as a short cut anyway. They caused noise pollution and I was under 2,400 residents so I couldn't set a ""No Industry Trucks"" policy (or whatever it's called). Someone driving usually takes the shortest route to their pinged destination, which also takes the fastest road. I STILL don't know why industry trucks were rumbling through my two residential neighborhoods at 2AM. I ended up deleting the gravel short cut road.

But Is It Worth It?
With all of that said, when it's on sale, it's really rewarding to build and grow a city. If you're new to city simulator games, I would reccomend watching different (and recent) youtube tutorials on how to get started. This is also if you're willing to forgive the game's graphics, and if you're willing to suspend your disbelief and compromise with the game. This game can be fun and challenging, but this game is probably NOT as realistic as you might want or expect. If you're willing to play the game how it wants you too, it can also be a very relaxing and creative outlet; but if you're detail oriented and you NEED things to be realistic, this game will feel inflexible and frustrating.

The only other thing that I can really say is that the way the game is presented in a strangely sterile and uninspired way. The gameplay Is comprehensive in most ways, but there's strange things like the ""Chirper"" icon and the constantly repeated ""tweets"" from your residents, as well as the odd donut truck. There's nothing that stands out with Cities Skylines. It's decent but unremarkable. No real unique art style, no real character or identity besides ""business chic and serious."" The game basically says ""I am a city builder."" I appreciate the minimalism... but it doesn't have the same charm or character as other simulation games."
20890,"niceeee
e"
20891,buy this game if you have too much time on your hands
20892,i love it
20893,"It's fine. I obviously enjoy it enough given the hours. It doesn't need any more positive reviews than it already has. Is it better than cities XL? Absolutely. Sim City? Absolutely. But that's more a comment on the state of city management games than the quality of this game. So on to the criticism, since it's all I ever do.

It's basically a traffic simulator, and does it extremely poorly. Road selections are terrible and citizens are extraordinarily simplistic. There is no lane control. There is only a 2 lane 1-way and a 6 lane 1-way (which I have never witnessed in existence once in my life and isn't even utilized by the games AI)... 

Mods GREATLY improve this, at the risk of added instability to an already poorly optimized game. Which seems to be this games development model, let the community fix it. I have bought a bunch of the expansions on sale recently and even the best ones feel half baked and low risk. I am scared for Paradox signing up for a second game with this company. While Paradox does put out some janky games, at least they progress greatly over time. This game hasn't moved an inch by the developers hand since release.

And again, what was release was extremely lacking:

Why there isn't a blueprint mode before you lay stuff down given the horrendous terraforming and janky snapping is beyond me. Money is only a problem in the very early game, making many financial choices arbitrary. Water is extraordinarily quirky and feels like a gimic. Building models between different sized buildings feel completely out of scale and certainly have very strange population capacities (again, can be fixed by a mod but mod user beware). The UI is very confusing, often unexplained and for some aspects of the game, like subways, a complete nightmare. God forbid you move a single stop in the entire game or be prepared to redo every single line hitting it.

I played through maybe 2 cities my first run with the game, then didn't touch it for another 6 years. Dropped 40 dollars on xpacs ON SALE (not nearly all of them, but the biggest ones) and barely got another run out of it."
20894,"Actually nevermind! This game is worth it! This game is very great, realistic, and impressive. Ever since i saw the trailer, I got something better as soon as I started to play the game.l"
20895,"if you like building sims, this is the best i have seen. Large mods community and much support activity"

20907,"Blurry text, after 6 years still no fix."
20908,"It's good. The base game will give you hours of content, and the Community Workshop gives you the assets and tools you need to join the ranks of people with literally HUNDREDS of hours of content. Very excited to see more of the community content and possible developer updates in the future."
20909,"Allows me to kill women with natural disasters. 10/10 game, would rage over traffic flow again"
20910,"great game. You can play it like simcity or go way deeper, it lets you get as crazy as you want with your depth"
20911,"Six years old now and showing its' age.  Slow, cumbersome and unstable. 

Time for a new version of probably one of the best games ever.

You need the mods but they make the game unstable and very slow to load.

This is a great game but needs some TLC.

20924,"Such a good game, Honestly wish I started playing this a long time ago. I spend many days sitting looking at my steam games like ""man, I just dont wanna play any of these games"" so my friend bought me this and said ""give it 45 min"" and I just couldnt stop. Im excited to play games again. Ty friendo"
20925,Best city builder out there
20926,"+ The game is very entertaining and easy to lose a lot of time in.
+ I can finally live out my dream of a boomer-free city.

- Many game features are not explained at all, google will be your best friend."
20927,Amazing game with incredible workshop support! Spent over 1000 hours on this game.
20928,Traffic jams are a damn pain in the ass
20929,yes
20930,they wont even let me play!
20931,very good but too much dlc ):
20932,"The game is amazing, from the graphics to the building the city itself there are many upon many things to do, the workshop allows the creative mind to often break down over the amount of choices.

However to praise something you often need criticism, and the only drawback i could see is the traffic can often behave as if your populous is one massive hive and all act the same.
example: there are two lanes that go in exactly the same direction, however the AI will only use one and cause a huge traffic buildup, even though one lane is completely useable.
Although workshop mods allow it to be fixed, it can ruin a normal persons playthrough."
20933,its good
20934,hh
20935,"Step 1. Plan the city
2. Create the city intricately.
3. Upgrade zones and services.
4. What the fuck happened to the traffic?
5. Plan a new city."

20945,me like game of city building
20946,I really hope they lean into procedural generation and emergent behavior for the sequel.
20947,"For literally YEARS, I thought i was too stupid to have fun playing this game. Unbeknownst to me, all it took was playing side-by-side with one of the men that I love for me to become an unbelievably detail oriented weirdo."
20948,its good.
20949,Broken traffic model.  ALL traffic only uses one lane so any realistic roads cause traffic jams.  Fucking pathetic
20950,how it feels to be a gangsta
20951,it's alright
20952,super fun
20953,"HOLY SIHIT I JUST SAW THE PRICE BUT HTE GAME IS SO GOOD, FUCK I JUST BOUGHT A NEW MOUSE INSTEAD, AND NOW I HAVE NO MONEY IF YOU CAN, BUY IT, ITS SO GOOD. I LIKE IT"
20954,"i still have yet to create a self sustaining city without going into debt,

9/10 would def play again"
20955,A well deserved city simulator that actively promotes community bonding through mods and community workshops. Highly appraised!
20956,many fun
20957,THEY WONT STOP DYING
20958,those fucking death wave is a little bit too much. placed 8 houses after 3 months in the game there is already dead people in 3 houses.  good job developers. no wonder people play this game with mods
20959,Most in depth city building game I have ever played
20960,If building cities is your thing this is the game
20961,"Got me playing for hours and hours. Fun with unlimited money, fun without. A lot to explore."
20962,very additcting
20963,SimCity grew up and got pretty.
20964,Easily the best game of it's kind. Played for 29 hours on Epic Games. Love it so much.
20965,I play this game a lot and I'd highly recommend it for the simplicity and the amount of mods available.
20966,"THIS IS VERY ENJOYABLE, It took my years of owning this game to get my first city to be successful but I never really put any effort until recently, if Paradox games are your jam and you want something on a smaller more modern scale, this game is perfect for you!"
20967,its fun
20968,:)
20969,"When all you want to do is create.  This'll do it.  When you want a game to be as difficult as you'd like it to be...this'll do it.  If you want to lay down the tracks and watch something magical grow...this'll do it.

Basically, this is a game that will keep you interested over many years - you might take a break or three in the middle but it's always a pleasant return trip."
20970,Great game with plenty of add-ons to give you a very in depth city builder tycoon simulation
20971,"Super fun, city building game that can really take you into the weeds if you want to get that detailed."
20972,"it is real fun if u played sim city, or the cities in motion series."
20973,I like
20974,"It's pretty much the new gold standard for city builders, really."
20975,good game
20976,"This game is so fun, it makes sim city look like sim shitty. It takes away the unrealistic game play from sim city and makes it one of best city development game I've every played"
20977,Great game
20978,"Excellent city builder, one of the best ever!"
20979,"Despite the huge playtime, I can't decide whether I actually like this game, whether I enjoy playing it, or whether it's good. It can be sort of comforting to play, but cities almost always end up being the same sort of US suburb, and most of the challenge is, every time, traffic management. Your cities have no history, no focus unless you impose one artificially (and even then it's more aesthetic than functional), no life (it's depressingly easy to bulldoze whole districts - the citizens who lived there relocate without a squeak), no charm. I think I keep playing it because I keep hoping it'll somehow become the game I want."
20980,"Absolutely amazing game! 
Prepare for a highly addictive strategy game that allows you to get swallowed up with views, sounds, traffic puzzles and micro management if thats your thing, along with larger scale world building."
20981,"The best city manager game since the game was released
"
20982,fvtgyhtyufgitgyu
20983,Great
20984,Probably one of if not the best city building game out there. Don't buy all the DLCs unless they are on a high discount though. Like with all other Paradox games.
20985,z
20986,This game is amazing totally worth the money! Feels like you are really building a city.

20992,hope developer can produce more DLC such as military zone. navy zone. airforce zone
20993,"After building your first city, there is very little new to do but still an engaging game."
20994,IF YOU ARE SMART THEN YOU'R WELCOME
20995,Great fun game love to play!
20996,Will keep you busy for long time
20997,Fun relaxing game
20998,"An amazing game.
Stupidly addictive, very easy to understand, lack of bugs and great fun!

Would recommend to anyone who likes a good game. (Which is everyone)"
20999,3 hours had gone by before I knew it when I first got in. 50 hours later I still have no idea what I'm doing but it's very fun to play.

21002,The Best SimCity Successor
21003,"This game is very fun with or without mods, highly recommend if you enjoy simulation/management games"
21004,"Fantastic experience, lots content and plenty to do"
21005,Yeehaw
21006,if you want to spend 6 hours creating the metropolis of your most puerile ambitions and then dedicate all remaining leisure time into paving over and repaving the same five blocks of legacy roading to decrease traffic congestion by percentages of a percentile then try not to trip over yourself in your rush to install upon half your disk space this game! i most certainly would NOT'VE
21007,"So far i find myself more engaged in this game than than any other in the last decade. I found myself telling myself at 11 ill just finish this one task and go to bed, to then realize that the sun was shining in from down the hall 8 1/2 hours later. Habit forming, this game is."
21008,"Fun, and enjoyable."
21009,"its fun until dead people are just lying on the floor until each building becomes a cemetery and then abandons and fires and more crime so more police, firetrucks, hearses, and more overall traffic.. great game."
21010,"Feels good to make progress constantly, good fun."
21011,If you liked SimCity you are going to LOVE City Skylines!
21012,Amazing
21013,Very Great Game
21014,"After playing Cities:Skylines for nearly 9000 hours, I think it's safe to say that I finally have enough experience to make a review. 

Overall, it's a pretty decent game but can get boring after the first 8,500 hours if you don't download new workshop mods and assets."

21027,build cities good
21028,"Absolutely Amazing, after the flop that was EA's city builder, Cities: Skylines was a breath of fresh air. I have now played close to 500 hours and can completely be absorbed into and create enormous cities. Highly recommend Park Life expansion pack."
21029,Great game. Loving the revisions to the new version. Lots of things make sense now. Highly addictive.
21030,are you seriously looking for reviews to buy this game! just get it already
21031,I love this game but it simply doesn't work on linux with crashing while saving and plenty of rendering issues. upsetting.

21038,great
21039,It's pretty good.
21040,"Cities:Skylines is definetly one of the best game I have played so far. You are continiously inspired by the environment around you, and you keep having new cities ideas, new challenges, new dream. 
    The game itself is an extremely complex and realistic city-building game. It simulates traffic, happiness, demography, and so much more. You can control and manage everything, from the water and electricity services, to the public transport, type of building in a specific area or the setup of a park (that's why it can be a bit complex). As you are completely free to build anything, the possibilites are endless. You want to build a new Amsterdam, you can. You want to build New York ? You can. You want to make a skiing area ? Well, you also can. It is just you, and the game.
    The graphism are amazing, and customizable. There are various maps on which you can work on. 
    Cities: Skylines has one of the best community I have ever seen : there are frenquently updates,and new DLC's (btw i gotta buy those last ones, because they seem so cool). Moreover, the game is fully moddable with the Steam Workshop (and man there is a lot of mods...). You can subscribe to new assets added by other C:S players.
    There are however some FPS issues if you have downloaded many mods, but that's okay. If you don't have a good computer, the experience won't be that immersive but I think with a specific setup that optimise the game, even with a pretty bad computer, you can play the game with at least 30 fps. I just wanna remind you that the game is extremely powerful and realistic, so its completely understandable.
    To conclude, I completely recommand this game. I keep playing it, and I will continue play that game for a while. One of my best purchases so far ;D . The game deserve its price."
21041,"Only if you want to waste precious hours of your life away LOL This game is extremely addictive, play at your own risk!"
21042,I created a city where everyone is forced to drink their own poop and isn't educated past elementary school. Perfection.
21043,good game
21044,"Base game alone isn't worth it but combined with all DLC it's definitely worth it, just wait for the game to go on sale so the game isn't needlessly expensive like all paradox games are"

11/10 won't play again."
21052,Great Game
21053,A better Version of Simcity (2013). Smoother gameplay with many features that were not available in Simcity (2013) and with a tonne of player added assets to download you are only limited by your creativity.

21058,"Started playing this just for kicks and now just obsessed with making my city grow.  The controls are a bit clunky (imho), but you get used to it.  But I love this game...you keep tweaking and changing things and the amount of mods/assets that are created are over 200k and climbing to help make your creation yours.  This game keeps you saying...""I just want to do one more thing before I go..."" 

You stay to play, not because it has big explosions, powerful guns or riveting story line, you stay because it is your creation and the brain is totally engaged at a different level.  Sorry hand-eye coordination junkies.  If you want a creative/intellectual engagement then this game will appeal   to the micro mangers and the casual sim builders alike."
21059,"YES, VERY GOOD, YES
"
21060,"awesome game... iff you spend heaps of money on a whole bunch of DLCs, otherwise kind of empty even with heavy use of steam workshop.
really not sure whether or not to recommend it, because the answer would be different depending on whether i'm rating base or base+DLCs, decided on downvote because of score it already has."
21061,i like it  if you're into this kind of stuff youll like it if not you wont like it
21062,"“Cities: Skylines is a title that will eat up hours of your time, and with a commitment from the developers to continue support for the title in the future, and Steam Workshop integration, the huge amount of replayability the base game has will become even bigger. I wholeheartedly recommend this game and can’t wait to see what modders and Colossal Order have in store for us in the future.”"
21063,One of the best games to relieve your stress
21064,A fun game for a change.
21065,"the game's good and really sucks you in once you get a hang of the controls (which are a bit clunky).

21073,"I always try to build my own neighbourhood in this game, but fail miserably."
21074,I enjoy to just sit around and build cities and look at the skyline in this game
21075,"I brought this game because I was a fan of SimCity but I wanted something bit more customisation such as modifications and be able to control your city freely. This game defo can be confusing at the start but once you keep playing, you will get the hang of it. I instantly brought some of the game's DLCs to add more features into my city. This game is so much fun, highly recommend for those who love building and controlling their own cities."
21076,"This is the best city building simulation game by far at this time. With tons of mods and community support it has taken the lead over SimCities and is slated to go even futher. Easy to start, easy to play, and easy to use."
21077,Ok
21078,Skylines is exactly what I had expected from the new SimCity game. And even more! The ability to add mods and customize the game keeps it interesting no matter how many hours I've played. Just recently I switched to Linux and was able to easily transfer and play the game on the new setup. Well made and fun to play!
21079,Love this game
21080,best simcity game out there
21081,"I've lost myself to this awesome game for over 200 hours, that's over 8 days and counting"
21082,Game Really GooooooooooooooooooooooD
21083,"Great Game, constant updates and new content. SimCity on Steroids!"
21084,Fantastic sim city builder with loads of community and dev support
21085,"It's an aesthetically pleasing and fun city building. Had it for a while, don't play a ton but it's a fun casual game. It's not really all that challenging and the hardest part is either getting a good setup at the start without going broke and forgetting something crucial, or dealing with traffic issues. So there's planning involved but the way the mechanics are, you can usually find an easy way to fix issues but the challenge is both getting it to look nice and do it without creating another problem lol"
21086,"Love this game, mainly bought it to play vanilla style, but there is so much more, with mods and assets I am able to create realistic looking, playable cities. Just be aware that if you want to use mods and assets from the workshop you should have more than 16gb RAM."
21087,best game
21088,"Edit: I messaged support, and the problem was fixed. This is a really fun game and I definitely recommend it.

I don't know whether to recommend or not. It's a really fun game, but even at the lowest settings, it has issues. My computer isn't top of the line, but it is fairly new, and it runs modern games at mid settings quite smoothly. It surpasses both the minimum and recommended requirements, so I'm sure that's not the problem. The game runs really well for about 20 minutes, and then it freezes and I have to close it down and reopen it, losing a bit of progress. This happens with no dlc, and it started before I had any mods installed. Idk why it's like this. The version on xbox game pass didn't do this at all, but I bought it on here earlier yesterday to use mods. I uninstalled the version on gamepass, and I even did a reset of my pc because I thought something was wrong with it. But even after reinstalling the game and resetting my computer, I'm still having this issue. If anyone has suggestions, please let me know."

21090,Fun
21091,"This game just gets impossible around 30K people. I changed nothing about my city and only made things better and I went from 30K people to 10K and from $3.9 million to $300K. I did nothing but improve my city but I just continued to lose people. I checked everything. No pollution, low taxes, no traffic, no noise pollution, and plenty of water, electric, and trash services. But no. Everyone was happy yet all dying or leaving. This game just makes things impossible to progress."

21093,"Getting better over the years though having all the DLC can lead to some confusion. The best and most chilled city builder ever. Keep coming back to it and have yet to see anything emerge to compete against it. Fun, relaxing and strangely satisfying working for hours on your road layout while other parts of your city go up in flames. Only wish crosswalks could be placed manually. There was a workshop mod for it that broke many updates ago. Minor niggle."
21094,Fantastic Game! My son and I are having a great time building our city.
21095,Greatest city-builder that I have played so far.
21096,good
21097,"Very fun sandbox/ city building game. I know it's been out for quite a while so given the time of release it's pretty well made and put together, still having occasional updates and DLC added, quite worth the purchase in my opinion.

PS I'm awful at the game but I still find it very fun :)

Granted, the massive amount of DLC, almost all of which being paid, is a bit of a turn off, given some like myself don't have $100+ to spend on a single game."

21112,"If you played any simulation game in the past, you won't be disappointed. Endless time spent on this (although I've only been on 33 hours) and has tons of stuff you can do. Can't wait to dump more hours into this."
21113,Very Good Game

21135,"Do you have enough skills to become an intersection controller in a game that's touted as a city builder but is actually a traffic simulator? Play Traffic:Jams, I mean Cities:Skylines, to become a rage fueled player where you spent your hard earned dollars on this time vampire that's all about managing traffic instead of actually building the city of your imagination. Take the role of traffic manager, I mean city planner, & scream in the howl of terrible agony as you watch traffic jam after traffic jam take shape before your eyes. Even micromanaging traffic to the nth degree will do nothing to eliminate traffic congestion so all your time is spent building M.C. Escher like intersections that do not exist in reality but is the only way to manage traffic so you can actually build a city which the developers of this game promised you would do when you bought it. Control traffic lights in different intersections which will make no difference in managing traffic because the pathfinding AI is only interested in the shortest distance between point A and point B which means all your vehicles will cause a traffic jam miles long so they can stay in one straight line for the shortest distance even if you design alternative routes. Become the best highway traffic controller of the country, I mean city builder, in a game that's all about managing roads and nothing else.

If you also love spending more money for all the DLC that costs 3 times as much as the base game by itself then Cities:Skylines has you covered. You'll hug yourself after spending tons of money on DLC that will give you an excuse to use for why your traffic never moves or works while putting money in the publisher's bank accounts and as an extra bonus you get to hear a special message from the developers in the form of a maniacal laughter soundbite as soon as you purchase it."
21136,fun city moment
21137,Cities: Skylines is by far the best city designing/building game to date. I've played countless hours on the Xbox port and really enjoyed it enough to repurchase the game to finally taste the content that Workshop creators make. Kudos to those developers and CO for creating such a wonderful game and experience. One of the most addictive games I've played.

21146,"Phenomenal game.  DLCs can be pricey, but if you're hooked by vanilla, they're worth getting (on sale).  I have greatly enjoyed the creativity and management of this game, and everytime time I return to it I feel more knowledgeable and better challenged by the deeper mechanics.  You should not miss this game..."
21147,"Great game, absolutely trumps Simcity. If you're into city building and modelling this is definitely for you."
21148,"Super addictive and deep city building sim. Even with just the base game and no DLC this is worth investing in (especially for super cheap prices in a sale). Loads of fun, easy to play but difficult to master."
21149,"best City building game/management.

my only real grip is some of the older vanilla features didnt' age well compared to the DLCs pf the same themes (industry, education, etc)

also the game seems to not be well optimized for larger populations as it chugs below 30fps when i pass 20k pop.  my PC isn't anything to laugh at either (2700x ryzen / 2080 rtx)"

21169,Masterpiece!
21170,"I have sunk so many hours into multiple city builder games over the years, and I believe that City Skylines is by far the most realistic, complex and addictive one on the market. The graphics are unreal when turned up and there is so much content out there that you can play for hours without even blinking. 

Behind a great game is a great company... I have played quite a few games by Paradox, and to be honest it is because in all their games they; continually add new optional content at a reasonable price, are exceptionally well thought out balanced games, and seem to be really in tune with what the community really wants.

Either way, if city builder games are your thing or if you are just exploring something new, City skylines is worth a look at."
21171,Finally I can distribute my Astrazendaya Vaccines accordingly

You can build and manage a city."
21174,BIG LARGE CITY VERY FUN

21178,very good.
21179,"Best city sim, PERIOD."
21180,its relaxing
21181,"If you like city building games, Cities:Skylines is for you.  The DLCs are worth it, lots of Mods from content creators are available via the workshop and new content is almost always available from the workshop."
21182,"es güd i like the game, build big city, and make people mad by putting taxes up to 29%"
21183,Tis good
21184,"Used to be good, but now not only do they want to sell you the game, they also want all your information so they can sell that to someone else, and if you don't agree then you can't play the game you bought from them, how this is not illegal is beyond me."
21185,once you get an idea of how to play this is all shades of addictive
21186,It is a good game to play
21187,"u make a city
its amazing"
21188,be nice if traffic was a little less dumb but otherwise fantastic game
21189,goodgame
21190,Fun
21191,"Absolutely amazing, I love being able to design cities from scratch with many types of networks, the other good thing about this game is that it allows mods, once you've gotten bored of the classic vanilla version why not add some mods to spice it up a little. Very great game, great graphics, etc. Lots of effort has been put into this game to try and perfect it and it's definitely deserved."
21192,everyone keeps dying.
21193,why the heck are the AAA developers (like Maxis) who invented these game genres (like SimCity) failing so miserably to make games like Cities Skylines today?
21194,"i love this game becuse you can make your own city
"
21195,Za te pieniądze co oferują nie ale  jak na przecenie jakiejś zobaczycie to tak. Gra na 10 godzin a potem staje się nudna
21196,There is no city builder like it. It's a glorious game with a crappy DLC policy like all Paradox games. But is this the best city builder around? No questions.
21197,ye7
21198,"I tend not to review games because that's tedious and who gives a shit about what I have to say; but ill make a slight exception for this one (without all the effort of writing an actual review).
[hr][/hr]
Cities: Skylines does an amazing job of what its trying to achieve. A [b]proper city building[/b] game. In essence, even the business model behind this game achieves this. A game with rapid DLC production means a game with CONSTANT content and support, subsequently creating a huge modding community. These modifications change the game in incredibly meaningful ways. From intricate traffic management (TM:PE), to ULT and lighting adaptations. This allows the player to transport themselves into the most realistic, beautiful looking places you could imagine. From just a small, pitstop gas station in the desert to large transport networks and interchanges, you can make anything you might see in real life traveling in your car. 
[hr][/hr]
I would recommend this game to anyone who is interested in painting a scene you might see in real life. Or just so you can nuke a bunch of imaginary cims with meteors, a games a game isnt it?
"
21199,game is great but ability to draw and the turn it to a road is mising
21200,"Probably the best city builder out there. In typical Paradox style, there's a lot of DLCs but unlike typical Paradox DLCs they don't feel like cash-grabs and they don't break the game and make it unplayable."
21201,this has become my favorite city builder game
21202,Definitely a great game to have in the library. Flex your mind and creative skills to build an aesthetically pleasing and effectively engineered city.
21203,Playing while rereading my transportation engineering course note. Still sucks :(
21204,I accidentally did a Flint Michigan 9/10
21205,"Fun game. Very pretty graphics, easy learning, but I struggle with the traffic CONGESTION!!!"
21206,Great to get your mind thinking about how issues around town planning affect each other - good and bad. Really good for young people to help them develop an appreciation for City Councils.
21207,"kinda good, but little replayability"
21208,yea
21209,You can do a bunch of stuff and it is just fun in general lol
21210,This game is fun and really helps you get creative when you built. I highly recommend this game to anyone who likes to get creative and built what they want. The DLC packs make the game more fun also.
21211,i thought i bought this like 2 days ago how have i played 42 hours this is too addicting
21212,Yep
21213,So I refunded the game... probably because I was too hasty and didn't give the game a proper chance. Funny enough I bought it during a sale. Overall this game isn't for the feint of heart but it's a really good game. I did have fun but realized I may not play it considering my schedule. I do plan on picking this game back up in the future at another time when it's on sale again. So yes this is a fun and very interesting game. ^_^  Don't be like me and be sure to give it a good try.
21214,Great game. The best city management game ever.
21215,n word
21216,"I've owned this game for 7 days and already hit 53 hours. The biggest pain in the ass is placing roads that actually line up and look pretty but if you watch YouTube tutorials, you'll pick up the tricks. Use a beginner's guide in the Steam Community to get started, and try playing with infinite money to learn how this all works. Otherwise, extremely addicting, and an excellent city builder."
21217,a game
21218,"Planned a city in cities skylines, learned how to not plan a city, got real life job as a city planner, proceeded to screw up a real life city. 10/10"
21219,It's the Best City sim. Game I've ever seen or played.
21220,Its very fun...the education system can be kinda annoying however. A elementary school only reaches 2 and a half roads?!?!?! Overall i would recommend but watch out for the education system.
21221,I rely like this game but it takes to long  to lode
21222,"I love this game, everything is good, but when i tried to log in to my city, i noticed that all my mods and buildings i downloaded were gone. this was very disappointing cause i have spend 200-hours playing. I tried to watch a video that Cities Skylines made it didn't help, I because i have over 83 pages of mods, so it wouldn't help to unsubscribe and subscribe again,  even so i tried and it still didn't work, please if anyone has a way to fix this tell me. Please?....."
21223,"This game is extremely buggy on Linux, I can't save my progress."
21224,"An amazing game. Before this there was only SimCity which at the time was the only city game worth playing . However over time that game became boring as they did not make any Major new features. Now city skylines exists and has taken the crown for best city game because of its realism, depth, and a large degree of automatism."
21225,To the developers: even the simple option to first CONTINUE GAME rather than go to the menu first and then go into the game makes me appreciate this game so much more. It's good for the price for people that like these types.
21226,Kinda cute

21229,good lah
21230,"☐ Build a city.
☐ See others' city designs.
☑️ Brag about how ugly your city is."
21231,"If you like sim & building games, you'll love this. Lots of detail, and whatever few problems I could find with the game (more like 'personal preferences'), there are tons of mods available that allow you to tweak just about everything. Perhaps not as fun as something like Tropico, but the levels of micromanagement easily make up for its lack of 'personality'. 9-out-of-10 in my book."
21232,It's just Great fun!!
21233,I want a new city builder.
21234,"My favorite City Builder, and with the DLC and free updates it's only gotten better"
21235,"very fun yes

21238,"Easier than SimCity in some ways
Super simulator with mods"
21239,Exceptional Game. Steam workshop optimization makes Cities Skylines very versatile and fun.
21240,Very fun but confusing asl but mods are very gud
21241,nice
21242,With the multiplayer mod it is so fun!
21243,Good City builder !
21244,"Best city-planning/building game in the market! There's so much to do, especially with the DLCs, you really cant get bored of playing. The game is so well thought out and almost has no flaws :)"
21245,Really love this game! It helps me concentrate and solve problems systematically
21246,"this look if your asking wither  or not to buy this game if you  can afford to waste time to understand the basic it is awesome,but be warned this game burns time effortlessly that you feel like the hour is only 5min"
21247,"good game
"
21248,"City go vroom, logistics go boom"
21249,Wonderful city builder that can be as basic as early Sim-City Variants or can be modified to the nth degree. I'm nigh on 100-hours into this game and still enjoy every moment playing it.
21250,"Good game with nice looking graphic, with a lot of mods and big city FPS go down drastically"
21251,"Overall, this game is fantastic. I like the variety of buildings, land, vehicles and roads that you can build your city with. The Steam Workshop support is great, with tons of maps, cars, mods, building assets, and much more. It's so satisfying seeing your city coming to life with buildings and cars on the road. 

The game goes without saying: it's kinda difficult. Micromanaging every road for traffic issues is tedious to fix and supply chain issues in your industry is hard to solve. (Particularly cargo trains and harbours, i hate them). 

If you are able to, get this game on sale. And maybe invest in 3 DLC packs."
21252,"Well for anyone who likes city building, well this is one of the best games out there. You can spend hours into this and see time fly by.. Great game"
21253,It is a great game but with serious flaws and of course the known Paradox DLC strategy when every single time it feels the DLC is about 5x times overpriced to what it really brings including the free update (compared to the full price of the main game). What makes this game really great is modding community and the content produced by these guys. Also it is not only great city builder but rather a puzzle that you build yourself and then solve. I am talking here about the transportation network and its effectiveness. Total game changer here is the Traffic Manager mode especially the option to disable despawning of vehicles.
21254,The workshop can be a chasm of loadscreens so be warned; but it was my own fault for downloading so much custom content. Very addicting and immersive city builder.
21255,stop complaining about taxes smh broke /Viggas
21256,Epic
21257,worth my money
21258,"It's basically traffic manager most of the times. Speaking of which, do not forget to get mods such as TMPE, Move It and the traffic anarchy mod for maximum enjoyment!"
21259,"Great game, relaxing, fun, intuitive, and nuanced."
21260,"Sim City done right, get it if you want an outstanding city builder."

21265,"first 10 or so cities i made i named ""Shafter"" and they all went bankrupt. however when i named one ""Balzzz"" it really popped off and i had a lot of fun developing Balzzz. i got the delux edition for 80% off and i really enjoy it."
21266,"others have said it much better, really fun game."
21267,"graphically it's pretty but in terms of game play it's slow paced I'd stick with Sim City 4 if you don't mind the vintage graphics things just tend to move a bit faster in that game and it feels more dynamic especially if you get the network addon mod. 

And at $80+ of DLC to access basic systems that come standard with SC4? Kick rocks"
21268,Really nice :) and amusing!
21269,you can build your own city
21270,You build a city and that's pretty cool.

21274,Cool
21275,"Lot's of fun. Few bugs here and there, but overall a very interesting and addicting sandbox game."
21276,"this game is truly addictive, yes i just bought all content ( and i mean ALL ) last weekend was a great time to pick this up at a good cost."
21277,"Unlike other games of this style, Cities: Skylines is actually beautiful.  I've seen dozens of screenshots of people's cities and they look wonderful.  With that said, I'm playing this game on a Macbook Pro circa mid 2012 and although it doesn't run perfectly, if the graphics are turned down it is still very playable.  

In addition, the creators have allowed mods free of charge.  Combined with a substantial DLC, (pay to play), library, the content is endless; it should be pointed out that the game is very complete and playable in its own right.  The DLC content very much adds new content, rather than a complete game being split apart for additional profit.

You can create your own maps fairly easily, as well.  

+Worth buying (even if not on sale)
+Excellent replayability
+Scalable (graphics can be set to either very low or very high)"
21278,"I have got stuck into this game many times, and always seem to reach the point of dealing with death, literally the death of citizens.  No matter what, the city collapses due to the pile-up of dead bodies.  I anticipated such a thing from multiple previous play-throughs and increased health to the max but to no avail as well as good traffic flow -  it still happens.  I methodically positioned crematoriums and whatnot in every block, but still didn't solve this issue in the late game.  This game is better than SimCity mainly because of the scale.  But the game (engine) fails in certain areas when things become too big.  I have looked briefly into the technical aspect of things with this game and it doesn't seem uncommon that big cities fail due to limitations of the game engine.  I could hope for a Cities: Skylines 2, but what really should happen is a Cities: Skylines with a new engine.  A lot of us have spent a lot of money of these DLCs and more investment is required on optimisation ultimately."
21279,great game!
21280,gud
21281,I enjoy it. (Too much DLC though.)
21282,I'm hopelessly addicted to this great game.

21287,"This is a game that have been in my wish-list since launch, feels good to finally being able to play on steam and use the workshop."
21288,"It's amazingly fun. I can literally just sit down for hours working on a little neighbourhood and still not get bored. It's pretty complicated sometimes, but It's nice to learn how to do things and manage it from there."
21289,Great game.
21290,"680hrs down on this game so I should probably get around to writing a review!

It's incredibly addictive, a great game to unwind from the stresses of the workday and just a thoroughly pleasant game all around. 

The base game is good but for once, I can honestly say the DLC is worth it! New stuff is coming all the time and it just gets better and better!

There are a few things I'd like to see (such as a city that can experience all 4 seasons etc) and I'm sure thats coming down the line.

As someone who grew up playing Sim City and Sim City 2000, this is exactly what Sim City should have evolved into.

A masterpiece of a game. Buy it, lose many hours to it, don't regret it!"

21334,great game
21335,good
21336,first played this for about 50 hours on PS4 and that should say something. its much better on PC and is very relaxing to play if you just want to chill and take your time building something
21337,"Great game. Fun, engaging, and surprisingly relaxing. Honestly, getting my city in order is down right meditative. Would highly recommend this game for those who are anxious at heart, but also aren't a perfectionist (because your city will never be truly perfect)."

21339,good game 11/10

21341,"The base game is enough to keep you occupied for many hours. Very relaxing, rewarding game play. Not a fan of having to pay more and more for extra content, but I guess it beats having to pay for a sequel that's exactly the same (aka any EA sports release and Destiny). If you go into the community workshop you will no doubt find a basic layout of the land for your closest city and you can go to work trying to recreate it. 

Take me for instance. My closest city is Melbourne. So I downloaded the template and fixed all the issues we have. Specifically the traffic situations that turn every person behind the wheel into a piece of shit. Now I live in this fairy tale version of my state capital where (in my head) all the cafes don't serve smashed avo on toast and the hipsters have to actually get jobs. There's actually a train line that goes to the airport too! Real progress. Where the fuck do all my taxes go?!"
21342,best city management game
21343,This game seems like a dumb down version of Sim City.
21344,i love this game! although i wish it could tell you were demand is for new building types via location instead of just having the bars at the bottom tell you
21345,"1.Uninstall the Paradox Launcher.
2.Create a bach file in your directory as ""cities.bat"".
3.Edit the .bat file and put ""cities.exe %command%""
4.Go to ""Set Launch Options"" in the steam of Cities: Skylines and put ""Cities.bat %command%""
5.Delete ""launcher-installer-windows.msi"" in the games directory.

Congratulations, you've deleted a useless launcher prety much designed as a spyware. Enjoy your game."
21346,"This game is the worst thing i have ever played in my life. Where do i even begin with this review?

I've been wanting this game for 2 years now it seemed like so much fun i really love the game Tropico so i thought i'd love this. i was so sooo wrong, This game is a wolf in sheep's clothing. i don't even know where to  start

the game is so tedious and unfun it goes like this

place housing district
place commercial district
place industrial district
place hospital and school
do it all over again over an over until you die

this game sucks there is absolutely nothing to do. for example in the game Tropico you have missions, that you get rewards for completing with funny humor and jokes. in this you have no missions no tasks no reason to do anything 

in Tropico you go to different eras with new unlocks and ways to play so you don't do the same thing over and over. in this there is nothing you do the same thing over and over and different areas this, game is so boring it's like watching paint dry.

in Tropico you can set polices that actually effect your people and their lives, like Paid Healthcare, Martial laws, Give your people guns. Things that are actually interesting and change the game. in here there's only like 10 polices you can set like ""ban dogs"" which barely does anything or ""ban smoking"" wow it changes nothinggggg!

in this game there's no way to even customize your city, place the same few schools and hospitals over and over you cant change the way they look at least or anything there's no point you can't place any interesting buildings. in Tropico you can place Malls, Night Clubs, Movie Theaters, all sorts of things. and customize them to effect your people's beliefs and happiness in all sorts of ways.

here you can pretty much only build parks that barely do anything there's no point. you can't create Hotels and pools and stuff like in tropico. the city looks the same everywhere, this game is so sad and boring.


i'm so sad that i wanted this game for 2 years i can't even.... i literally can't i'm crying as i type this this game is so awful

I'm so glad i bough this during sell if i had actually paid $29,99 for this i would have actually shot myself no joke. and for god sakes the DLC is all like 300 dollars combined, and most of it is radio stations. who the HELL IS PAYING 4 DOLLARS TO LISTEN TO JAZZ RADIO IN A VIDEO GAME!!!????? WHAT IS GOING ON WHO ARE YOU PEOPLEEE? 

JUST LISTEN TO MUSIC ON YOUTUBE IN ANOTHER WINDOW FOR FREE! OR ON YOUR PHONE FOR GOD SAKES. DON'T PAY 4 DOLLARS FOR JAZZ MUSIC 

i am losing my mind do not buy this game 

PLEASE FOR YOUR SANITY DON'T BUY THIS. ITS NOT WHAT YOU THINK THIS WHOLE GAME IS A LIE!

Buy Tropico 4, Tropico 5, Tropico 6, Civilizations, simcity, build a city in minecraft anything but this don't buy this game its all a lie

there is no game it make look like a game, but when you play it you realize there is no actual game. its a lie, its a myth, its a scam! THERE'S NOTHING HERE THERE IS NO GAME THERE IS NO CITY ITS ONLY SADNESS




RUN RUN FAR AWAY 


maybe i'm missing something. maybe i'm not playing right am i doing something wrong? am i playing the game wrong? someone please tell me, someone please help me.

i don't want to believe the game is this bad i waited 2 years because i thought it would be fun. whyyyyy?????????

who are the DEVS? what is wrong with them? why would they do this why would they lie to us?

This game is fake there is no Cities: Skylines it only exists in trailers and in your mind when you actually play it it's not real"

21371,Super realistic simulation game
21372,so fun
21373,"This is the best city builder I've ever played and I cannot recommend it enough! I've probably put in around 1000hrs (ignore the counter, just switched over to the steam version) and it is still fun. I'll play in huge bursts, then take a long break, come back and be blown away all over again by how much fun it is and how well made it is! If you are a new player, you don't necessarily need the DLC, but they certainly help to keep the game fresh for long time players!"
21374,i love this game
21375,Really Really good
21376,"I love this game, so much better than sim city even. That being said the game has begun to hit the limit of what the engine can handle. The expansion packs are fantastic but once you own most or all of them, too many assets are loaded into the game meaning you will end up uninstalling the expansions you aren't using for a particular playthrough if you want the game to run smoothly. Hardware does not affect this problem. All in all it is a first class city builder, and at this point I am waiting  for the sequel."
21377,"nice game its fun
"
21378,"its very fun and addictive...
would recommend this for anybody"
21379,"Even though the DLC packs are way overpriced, and the base game kinda needs a few essential mods to really make the building part better, this game is at it's core an incredibly fun game. Mix in the amazing modding community, the best parts of what the DLC's add, and an ounce of creativity and this game will keep you busy for years. 

I come back to this and play once or twice a year, because there's nothing quite like it and hasn't been since it released. I don't know why this genre is so hard to get right, but I feel like they really got it right with this one and has aged really well. I hope some day soon we get an even bigger and better sequel, if that's even possible."
21380,fun game better than simcity. Very realistic
21381,"Fun game, lots of mods and Youtube videos if you want to learn more or explore different assets"
21382,good
21383,A relaxing game that doesn't make you want to throw a piano at your friends and family. But at the same time requires a lot of effort to learn and master. Unless you use mods. Then its slightly easier.
21384,"its cool, i got it when it was 80-%"
21385,Great way to escape reality.
21386,"tsunami go brrrrrrrrrr

honestly i've been own this game free from EGS but i more interesting to play on steam and buy the dlc on steam too
otherwise III LOOOOOVEEEEE U GABE"
21394,"I have recently re-visited CS via Xbox Series X.  I hope that this excellent city builder gets a next Gen version soon.   It is already very good on console, but it can be so much better.  Hi-res graphics and anti aliasing are needed.   Game-play is as good as ever.  Going back to the PC version has been interesting.  Overall, I would thoroughly recommend CS to any new Players.  It is the best, by a long way."
21395,"Good City builder, especially when i just wanna chill in a game (:"
21396,"Nothing too special but a really solid singleplayer game, good graphics, gameplay and a soundtrack i suprisingly enjoyed"
21397,fun
21398,"i have played simcity on my mom's PC when i was younger, and this gives me flashbacks to that game. I think it is a great game if you like building and economy games, it was kind of hard to understand in the beginning how everything worked, so i would recommend watching some youtube video's. Overal i really enjoy the game. 

extra note for mac players: I am playing this on my macbook pro 2019 and i works great, so if you have a similar laptop it should work fine."
21399,AMAZING
21400,Absolutely amazing game with mods! i am on a low end system (macbook air 2017) still runs around 10 fps - 20 fps and its smooth i recommend this game to anyone just be aware of the challenges and the frustration that might come :D and deffinately get mods like it makes the game so realistic and everything it really depends which mods you choose or not
21401, By far the best city building game
21402,Relaxing game. Very detailed and realistic graphic that doesn't need an expensive pc to run smoothly. I've been playing this to soothe my anxiety and depression.
21403,would be better if i came with a free GPU and CPU upgrade
21404,"its a really realistic experience, and its really fun"

21406,this is a good game!!!!
21407,great game
21408,"It blows my find after find out this game doesn not have a undo button.
For the love of God.
THIS GAME DOES NOT HAVE A UNDO BUTTON.
Let that sink in.
(will give a recommendation if there is one)"
21409,"In my opinion, this is the best city building game out there."
21410,"If you wanna try games with a city builder system, definitely you need to play Cities: Skylines. It's one of the greatest in the field and you would have some fun being like a city owner and exploring new ways of creativity. Also, if you are into architecture, civil engineering or related, this is definitely a game for you."
21411,"Best game. Its very chill to build a city. Also, can be very brain eating when trying to build an effective and beautiful city without any traffic congestion"
21412,"After playing games like AoE series   and other small scale resource management games like PvZ series etc   .. this is by far the most complex and informative game I've played  in my leisure.
Kudos ! to the developers for all the detailing and DLC's to capture  all  the macroeconomics . Keep those updates rolling :D 

 There's was  wonderful learning curve and I have new-found respect for resource and city planning :) 
Never been happier with any other game.


What could be better  : Resource Interface , an UNDO option when you pause the simulation , a smarter Help-button  and slightly higher resolution graphics. 

"
21413,"This is simply the best City builder there is, and has been the best since its release. It's a game I always come back to and I'm sure some may glace at the DLC and think OMG look at it all, but I have to tell you, this game as well as their DLC's are constantly on sale for 50-80% off. The base game was litterately just 7$ a day ago as of writing this review.

You can get an absolute steal with the game and its DLC, I would say you don't particularly need all the DLC's either,you just need the main ones likes Industry / Campus / After Dark / Mass Transit and Natural Disasters (the ones that add the most content) but I think a lot of people would find the disasters annoying, but you gotta have disasters! What kind of a city game is it without disasters eh? You really don't need any of the radio stations OR the creators packs, the steam workshop is plenty enough for that, and the radio stations are really neat, but those are simply just down to personal taste.

The sheer amount of content in this game is absolutely unreal, you can sink 100 hours and still not see all the content if you have a lot of the DLC. I do play on normal speed though I don't speed it up, but I like taking my time to build my cities up. The simulation is absolutely unreal (unlike SIM CITY) the simulation doesn't actually break down early-mid game. You have GOT to do road management though, this is one of the most important aspects, 1-way roads are your best friend!

With the incredible modding community, the realism, and graphic enhancements make cities: skylines look just absolutely beautiful. The animations for EVERYTHING are just fantastic! everything is simulated down to a microscopic level, if you love City builders, if you were a big fan of the old Sim City games, you just simply cannot go wrong with Cities: Skylines. From creating a standard city, to building mega metropolis's, to adding concerts, sports stadiums, airports, harbors, tourism, blimps!, as much of public transport you can think of from Bus's and taxes, to Ferrys and metro systems, It literately has everything you could possible want from a city builder, its so far beyond whats currently out there, and has been for years! 

I cannot recommend this game enough! You will not be disappointed with this game."
21414,"While I do enjoy playing city builder games, but this game feels like it's been striped of it's core components.  For example, if you want all the transportation options you have to buy all the DLC with transportation options.  While I also have no problem buying packs (aka DLC), I have problem with having to buy packs that should have been in the base game.  Packs for a game shouldn't be something you have to buy to be able to experience all the game has to offer.  I will say Cities Skylines is different then other city builders, but so is the latest version of SimCity.  It feels like Paradox and EA have a monopoly on city builders since they seem to be better then most, but still lacking features in the base game.  I think packs should add to the game not take away.  For example, I would recommend add advanced version of the buildings that are in the packs for the game and put the features from the packs in the base game.  This way people are able to enjoy the new content that comes out when a new pack is released but without paying the price unless they want different or better version of the buildings that would come in the update.  However, I will say they have added features in the past to Cities Skylines when I new DLC came out without needing the new DLC, but from what I've played features from the base game are missing.  Although, I could just be salty because almost every game has DLC nowadays.  At the end of day I still would recommend this game because it is more reliable than SimCity 2013 was when it launched.  Anyways, I give this game a 6/10 because I still think it is better than SimCity 2013.

Edit: I will say some of the mods out there help fill in the gaps for missing features.  I still think the game is 6 out of 10, but it could have a better score if they would stop trying to pull an EA.  Just because EA did it with the Sims doesn't mean you should.  I'd have less of a problem if it had a micro-transaction store with items that made it easier to beat the game, not take out core features of a game.  Anyways, I hope they don't continue doing this in the future."
21415,good game
21416,"What can I say about Cities Skylines?

Well... for one, it's the game that keeps me coming back... year after year, after year.. Just when I think I'm done, I see something new from the community, and it pulls me back!

I'm a long time SimCity fan all the way back to the original SNES version SimCity. The summer days of leaving the box running 24/7 to get that maximum profit from my little RCI U shaped blocks all on my dad's old bouncing tube TV (the screen would bounce because it was so old and crappy) seemed like only yesteryear..

I moved on to SimCity2000/3000/4(One of the best #4) and the wreck of what they called SimCity (2013) where I lost all hope.. I remember the first time I finally got my SimCity4 city profitable, my older brother pressed the power button on my computer, which force shut it down on the spot.. I didn't play for another 4 months after that!

Then came a little something called Cities XL... Which I tried to get into, it was beautiful, different, but lacked some of the core things I loved about SimCity.

Finally, a revelation in the Simaverse, Cities Skylines... It's hard to believe this game is over 6 years old now. The vanilla game is OKAY by itself.. If it weren't for the Steam Workshop and the modding community continually improving this game, it would have been dead years ago.

Of course the game is not perfect.. AI is ridiculous, which it somehow always tries to use the right lane for travel, causing constant traffic jams.. BUT, there's a MOD for that! I could go on and on, but there's always a mod for that too.

If you have the itch to spend hundreds of hours managing your traffic instead of beautifying your city, this is the game for you.

If you have the itch to spend hundreds of hours beautifying your city and neglecting your horrific traffic problems, this game is for you.

If you have the itch to watch it all burn to the ground, flood, pollute, garbage pile up, and have dead people everywhere, this game is for you..

You know what? If you're here reading this, then this game is for you."

21426,"Just get it its sooooo gooood. 
Note dont get the windows 10 edetion its great but you dont get access to the steam workshop."
21427,"First off, I will note that I have spent a massive amount of time on this game. It is one of my most played titles and I have gotten a lot of enjoyment out of it. At the same time, I cannot reasonably reccomend this game. The performance, stability and reliability problems with it are too big for me to ignore. The developers do not include basic features covered by mods, while at the same time breaking them(and destroying saves 50% of the time as well when they do break) every 6 months. I put in a lot of effort into my cities and the developers' lackluster attitude towards their modding community has destroyed many of my saves before. I, as the player, would rather have the ability for mods to transform the gameplay into something that I enjoy more, rather than recieving insubstantial updates every 6 months, which require paying money for the DLC to take full advantage of anyway. Additionally, any remotely dedicated player will run into the game's technical limitations very quickly. There is a very low cap on pedestrians and cars active, which causes larger cities to be disfunctional and buggy. Additionally, performance leaves much to be desired.

TL;DR on a surface level, brilliant concept and fun experience, but the technical problems with the game lead me to not reccomend it, as those issues have caused me a lot more stress than fun."

Pros: 
- Workshop support
- You can build giant cities. (Unlike Simcity 2013)
- Longterm support by the devs and the community.
- Lots of expansions
- Good graphics

Cons:
- Makes you hate traffic. (Im serious, traffic gets really annoying when your city starts to grow)"

Looked in settings to see there is an auto-save feature but it's disabled by default. Finding this out the hard way is literally worse than not having an auto-save feature at all, and makes me wonder what other nasty surprises there might be. Yeah, no thanks. I have no intention of going back 4 hours to re-do everything I've done this evening."

21487,"This game is everything I like on a game. I'm a huge fan of building games especially city building. But I already wasted a lot of time in this game that I figured it's no longer worth it. I spent hours building my city but every time I reach around a thousand population, your game will be very slow to the point it's no longer playable. There are even times that the loading takes an hour and sometimes it won't even load.

So, nope. I won't ever play this game anymore until they fix it and make it actually playable!"
21488,"Its the good, play yes much."
21489,nice
21490,"Amazing city builder, coming from an old Sim City player. I loved it,"
21491,"leuk spel, lekker stadje bouwen
nomnom"
21492,"the best city builder ever made, so many free assets in the workshop to help make things look better.not to mention the mods,maps,themes. just unbelievable!"
21493,pause while you set plans and it becomes a slower game.  nice ans casual
21494,hanged 3x during 30 mins of play!! my computer is pretty strong for this game and no other games hang !
21495,"Very theraputic game, but just very addictive"
21496,good
21497,Only just started but quite fun
21498,very funny and cool game
21499,👌
21500,E altfel la Cluj...
21501,highly recommended.
21502,"Fun all on all aspects, whether you're taking a more serious approach or just killing time"
21503,Best game. It gives me a headache because it's so realistic =)
21504,it's fun
21505,
21506,"Very fun game, specially for a person like me who enjoys and love doing city designing and such. Been wanting to buy this game ever since I saw it from yt."
21507,First play for free grate city building and testing. I am impressed how many items are on the workshop
21508,"Barely any info on what to do, reminds me of another game I played from these devs ""Stellaris"".
Filled with so many features and buttons to press, but barely any explanation about it, both games just have me staring at the screen like.. okay, what is it exactly you want me to do in this game??
The only positive thing about this game is that I could try it for free this weekend, so I didn't have to refund it."
21509,"Learning Curve seems a little steep at the begining but pretty soon, your city starts to thrive and you can relax a bit and tweak to you hearts content. The DLC is pretty good and the Natural Distasters will prevent you from Relaxing, butr you can aways limit its effect until you find your feet.
The More you play the more you want to create and tweak you cities. I love this games."
21510,i can spend 24/7 playing this game
21511,mazeikiai
21512,"It is Real Damn Awsome.
A really fun city builder 9.5/10"
21513,POV: you're studying social geographies and spatial planning
21514,"It's fun. You have a lot of choice, but if you're playing this game to ""win"", it's very, very easy. If you're playing this game because you want to design the city, go for it. I would definitely recommend for people (like myself) who like both designing things, and games that turn into ""work""."
21515,Terrific Game!
21516,"I grew up with SimCity 4 and always loved it. When the newest SimCity came out back in 2013, I was so disappointed. Then, a few years later, Cities: Skylines became available to the public and I bought it for what I remember was a reasonable price back in the day. It has become my all-time favorite game and is everything that SimCity should have been and so much more. Well done, Cities: Skylines."
21517,Very good game.
21518,Pretty town turn into pretty city
21519,"Fantastic game that can still be played two decades from now, when you have much a better computer. Cities Skylines only gets better in time"
21520,"I like this game but the number of dlcs and their pricing, when newer mechanics are required, is too much. buying the full game is £80. The main expansions you get are free from modders."
21521,"Emm, I am a president."
21522,great Build City Ever
21523,very good big big city big big pretty
21524,"Best citybuilder, and has been for years. Hard to see who's gonna make the challenge"
21525,Great game!
21526,good
21527,"Was always a fan of the SimCity games growing up. This game is a massive leap ahead of that, and that's even before you start using community assets and mods. I could spend hours on just a single neighbourhood, great fun."
21528,Yep. Good Game
21529,great game.
21530,Good and relaxing game ;)
21531,its a good game to murder people in

21540,Really good!
21541,i like this game
21542,verygood
21543,"Simply put: there aren't any city building games i know of that matches this game. I wish there was competition in this genre, because then we might see something revolutionary in the future of the city building genre that improves upon what was introduced in this game.

if you dont like city building and road layouts, then it isnt for you. 

get the dlc on sale."
21544,"Good game and satisfying to play. Helps to heal the profound wound caused by 2013 Simcity! With mods to help traffic and road building, it's best city-builder game currently out there. Game can be rough without mods, which makes the developer's decision to disallow achievements when mods are enabled is kinda a letdown. And, in Paradox Interactive fashion, the game has a ton of overpriced DLC options. Still definitely worth picking up and playing, though. Definitely one of the most polished builders/manager games out there."
21545,Best city builder game out there. Hands down.
21546,nice game
21547,is good city builder
21548,awesome game
21549,actually a very good and entertaining game. I reccomend to add as many mods as you can to optimize your experience
21550,A fun city builder game with very pretty design. I love the asset editor and different maps.
21551,"fun, very very fun"
21552,i build city :D
21553,Oddly fun and distracting
21554,great city builder. way better than simcity. 10/10
21555,Had way too much tormenting people with bad city design. To me this game is a good balance between micromanagment and casual simulation. There's enough to keep you busy but not so much that you feel overwhelmed for very long.
21556,good game
21557,The best city-simulator out there.
21558,Love it...
21559,"Great game to just chill and build, lots of realism to keep you immersed as you progress. Highly recommend!"
21560,great game if you liked sim city
21561,Its a vary in depth simulation with lots of things to do and beautiful props
21562,"Great game to spend hours of you time to avoid pulling your hair out over the crazy people in the white house trying not to run our country or just plain run our country into the ground. Either way, Cities Skylines is run better then the USA, at least at this time, or until we get all the crazies out of office in D.C."

21570,its a fun game it was only free for a cuple of days
21571,Hours of fun! If you like logistical games this is one you need in your library!
21572,"Get some workshop tools and get addicted. 

Warning. Addictive."
21573,"
I felt like this was just a mass transit traffic control simulator and less of a economic simulation city game."
21574,Yea it's a fun city building game probably THE standard but there is way to much DLC it's like don't bother if you don't have 110$+ when it's on sale.
21575,The fact that with so many mods and creators you can virtually make any city of your desire.
21576,"Back in early 2015 i was highly anticipating this game before release and couldn't wait for the day it came out. Bought this game on release day and had hours and hours of fun and watched the game growing in functions as the amazing Developer added more features into the game and put larger additions into dedicated (but thankfully not mandatory, except for some mods) DLCs for individual customization of the game.

All of that worked perfectly and you could create your own personal dream cities and places you would love to live in. And with the mod support you could even add real existing landmarks and give your places the personal touch it needs. I always loved that and watching the traffic move and how people live their daily lives in their city was fascinating to watch. Seeing places evolve, grow and become your personal digital neighborhood.

Heck even the day1 Mod support was always top notch and for over 4 years i loved this game to no end because of it's smooth and unproblematic integeration into the whole Steam eco system and even ran perfectly under Linux which was one of the main reasons why i bought it.

However... Paradox, the Publisher, decided to ruin everything with the introduction of a own and completely pointless Launcher for this game.. So in order to play this 6 year old title now you need to create an additional account next to your steam account to play this game and to make matters worse, they did not even publicly announce this. It is to this day (May 23rd 2021) still not clearly stated on their steam store page and the install of the launcher is not even optional but mandatory. So in order to keep playing this 6 year old game now you have to sign up for an additional account and give away personal infomation even thou all of that was never needed and still in't needed as it does not add anything to the game at all because everything always worked through Steam. As it should.

Even horrible companies like Rockstar or Bethesda announced their introductions of their launchers and clearly state that on their storepage. And those companies are beyond malicious. Let that sink in for a moment.

And since Paradox clearly doesn't give a damn i cannot recommend this game anymore to anyone. Sorry, Paradox does not deserve your money. Do not make business with such a shaby corporation. I just feel sorry for the Developer as THEY are the ones who suffer from thisn idotic publisher behavior.

The Moderator team of this game's Steam forum also censor every bit of legit criticism and pretend everything is fine and dandy and everyone loves these changes. The worst possible way to handle things and another proof how scammy and disgusting this publisher actually is.

Nobody should be forced to simply accept this BS.
So i say NO. I CANNOT recommend this game anymore.

Publishers who retroactively force propriaritaty launchers with extra accounts, into older titles with patches should be expelled from Steam."
21577,If you like builidng cities and like a challenge
21578,Best Sim Builder since Sim City 4
21579,Yea it is a good game.

21586,"One of the best games I have ever played, maybe not the first but clearly in top 5"
21587,You get easily lost in this game for hours at at time. Super fun and a great chill game to do in your freetime.
21588,"Great game, but mods are needed to really enjoy it"
21589,haha build only bigest cite ^^ best
21590,"Is good, dlc not so good"
21591,"Fun game! Makes it so you have to think ahead in order to gain the best outcome.

It's also fun to build cities then destroy then, but I didn't need to tell you that."

21595,"very very good 
"
21596,Can't stop playing this game
21597,"super fun game! once you get into this game it's so easy to just spend hours playing.
mods and assets are almost a must. vanilla assets just get repetitive after seeing them everywhere in your city, but honestly even with like 2000+ assets you'll find yourself downloading more.
"
21598,I wish there were something like a Neutral review. i wouldn't go thumbs down but the base game is not very involved. Even on sale you will spend well over 100 dollars for the DLC. I just don't think it is worth it. After 30 hrs had one failed city and 2 successful cities. Then there was nothing else to do. Second successful city was only to remedy traffic. Base game is worth it on sale only.
21599,"Once I watched a few videos on ""how to start a city"", it became VERY fun. Don't think your first city will survive. It probably won't. :)"
21600,ins fung
21601,Good game.
21602,Very good
21603,"Very detailed, beautiful city builder game. Play it vanilla once. Gonna download some mods and play it again."
21604,I have played this game on X-Box and I loved the game there and it gets even better on PC!!! You get steam work shop and everything!! 10/10 Game and I recommend buying this game!!!
21605,Hmm.. guess I just played for 8 hours straight...
21606,good game
21607,"After coming into Cities: Skylines as an old SimCity player, I wasn't sure what to expect, but it's since become one of the best games I've ever played.

As a city builder, the vanilla game is already fun but the deep modding support and exceptionally talented modder community really takes the game to new heights, making designing a beautiful city that runs well (or a city that doesn't run at all but looks borderline photorealistic) easier and more accessible. Solving for efficient traffic solutions is one of my favourite things to do in new builds and it's very satisfying seeing that traffic flow number stay high no matter your population, not to mention how mesmerising it is seeing traffic flow through an intersection you built! Learning how to create a realistic city layout is counterintuitively where the longer-term learning curve is for the game if you're a builder, and it's really fun picking up how real cities are made through your experience with the game.

As a city [i]management[/i] game I do think it still falls a bit short of the SimCity peak - the vast majority of the game's difficulty is in traffic management for the most part, and once you can solve that to a reasonable degree then the rest of the game's difficulty is pretty trivialised. Education as a whole is ridiculously overpowered, money basically becomes a non-issue past a certain city size, power generation is a straight upgrade the further up you go with no downsides, and there is no intercity or regional management to be done. If you have absolutely no interest in building a good-looking city and don't find traffic management interesting you will probably not enjoy the game as much, though - as with most things - there are mods to fix it.

That's really where a lot of the strength of C:S lies in, its mod support - things like road and building placement, the 9 tile limit, vehicle/entity caps, population distribution, and a few other things all feel very restrictive in the base game and performance is not good especially on computers with weak CPUs, but all of the above can be fixed or mitigated with mods. It is a very good investment if you like the game even a little bit, and I don't envy console players having to do without them!

The DLCs for the game are also fairly priced and interesting, IMO. Some of them are more narrowly focused than others so I would definitely prioritise if you're on a budget (special emphasis on Industries which is my favourite) but all of them have their uses in regular gameplay, which is a nice change of pace in the overall cynical climate of the modern gaming industry today.

Overall, totally awesome game with an almost unparalleled community modding effort paving the way for a continued future. Paradox regularly runs sales and I would totally recommend grabbing the game when they do next!"
21608,i disliked it
21609,It is a pretty fun game but for a better experience you really need the DLC and a good amount of mods.
21610,"Drops frames badly on my 3600X and Vega 64 in moderately sized cities, on lower settings. Lack of graphics options. Ludicrous amounts of DLC. Not much challenge initially, and feels more like a sandbox game as a whole. Recommended if you really want to build a detailed city and don't care about performance, but not if you want to enjoy a challenge."
21611,"the reccomended specs say this game needs 6gb of ram...
well once you start to get a few mods youll learn that this game can eat ram for breakfast
so if you are going to get some mods 16gb is what you need"
21612,GOOD NICE 😍😍😍😎😎😎 JAKARTA
21613,Fun and easy to mod
21614,"Always have been fascinated by simulation games and Cities: Skylines definitely delivers in the realism aspect. incredible game clearly made with love. i really got nothing but nice things to say about it, even the community is amazing!"
21615,"Very fun, great development team alongside great mix of inside and outside sources."
21616,.
21617,gggg
21618,"the controls sucks and it would have been a good game but they ruined it 
i didnt have the best experience but maybe you should try it its currently free."
21619,one of the best city builders available . 101% Yes
21620,i love it my top three games is hearts of iron 4 then cityskylines andthen minecraft
21621,pain
21622,game crashes on start up and cant find a fix its bugged and doesnt work

21624,"I downloaded this because of the free weekend thinking I'd try it to see if I like it.
After patiently waiting hours for it to download I launch it, expecting to be able to play the game.

But it doesn't boot into the game, it boots into a launcher (yes, a launcher, in this day and age) and wants me to agree to another EULA, and then two privacy policies.

I actually decided to read the EULA and found that Paradox wants permission to harvest information about by hardware set up and what web browser I use.

There are some prices I'm not willing to pay to play a game, and one of those is having companies leech my personal information.
Granted, in this case the information Paradox might learn isn't likely to be very sensitive, but really it's the principle of the matter.
Video games exist to be played, the companies publishing them should not be using their customer base as a means of mining data.

So naturally I uninstalled everything without even playing the game.

(I should have known better really, Paradox already ruined Prison Architect by adding a launcher when there wasn't one.)"
21625,Great game
21626,very nice
21627,yes
21628,Turkish language support must come.
21629,Scratches a similar itch to the civilization games.
21630,this game so hard to play but this game just happiness for me thank you
21631,good game for chill
21632,"No Multiplayer... I know most of the games like this don't MP too, but its no reason to not have one. Pairing the multiplayer mod with others breaks the game. Can't blame this on the studio tho. Add Multiplayer!!! Even modders can!"
21633,very enjoyable so far with this game.
21634,with the proper mods this game is great
21635,"YEAH YEAH

21637,My brain is hurt when playing is game but i can't stop @@
21638,great city builder
21639,"Pros:
- The best city simulator out there currently I think.

Cons:
- Unrealisticly hard trash management - I'm making my own city which has a single waste disposal place, the red trash can icon is my bff.
- Heavy reliance on Workshop content.
- The sheitty ""pay me a whole DLC so you can get these five new buildings"" model just sucks."
21640,I guess its the best city building game ever.
21641,Very nice city building simulator!!!
21642,just realized I played this game for 4.5 hours straight
21643,best city builder game i ever played

21649,"I have only played for 2 hours, however I think just about long enough to write a brief review. I bought the game on a Publisher weekend after trying the free 2 day demo. The price I bought it for was £4.59 and for that much, exceptional value. The complexity may come as a surprise to some, however I personally believe it adds to the realism. 
One complaint I have is; the lack of tutorials. Usually, I hate in-game tutorials however in this case I've realised how much I need them. So, this resulted in me going to YouTube and the web for tutorials. It's slightly inconvenient but, you only use them once."
21650,"I love this game really much. It doesn't seem to have bugs and it just gives you a really good time. You don't need a really good PC to run this game. Also, this is perfect for casual gamers who want to sit back and relax."
21651,Got the game as a gift but too slow/boring to get into
21652,Fun
21653,pre good ngl
21654,good game
21655,Great time to pass the time. There is a learning curve but its worth it.
21656,"I enjoy this game, however, this review should serve as a warning to all who have not realized. This game requires you to buy pretty basic additions to the game. Fuck you paradox and your shitty locking of content that should just be in the game regularly behind DLC (and for essentially making paid mods)"
21657,yeah u get to build a city and whatever but the traffic sucks butt always and peoples houses r always burning down but its okay i guess
21658,What SimCity should have been.

21660,"I got the base game for 80% off, and the rest of the ""new player bundle"" for ~20USD. 

It's worth it for this price. The UI is... not good, systems are poorly explained in-game, requiring me to pull myself out of the immersion to look things up, etc. I'm also not generally a fan of games with hundreds of dollars of paid DLC add-ons, but most of these are cosmetic and don't really impact the game. 

But I've played for a while, and (usually) had fun. If you really want to dive into the minutiae of the game though, expect to spend a lot of time on the wiki and YouTube.

Save a lot so you don't waste too much when you do something like realize your monorail system is wildly inferior to a metro and have to undo all your construction."
21661,awesome and cool
21662,super time consuming fun
21663,"Nutshell:  Ridiculous ""fight the UI and google how to do basic things"" game that includes elements of a city planner.

STARTING THE GAME:  
My Morale = High.

However:
My expectations were all wrong :(

-This is an old and beloved game, with high player / website reviews.
-Coming out in 2015 - all the major bugs are fixed right?

(Encountered Game-breaking bugs that froze my camera and made it swing wildly.)

My Morale = Shaken.

They didn't prioritize bug fixes so you can SEE where you need to to build? 
Oh dear.

-This game is about PLANNING A CITY, and then ADAPTING to changing needs, right?
-If you planned well, and adapt to situations well - that means you're a good player, and you get satisfaction, right?

-What is challenging is, ya know, game problems, like balancing happiness, resources and economic needs, right?
-What is EASY is the interface, and doing basic things like adding / removing roads and buildings, right?

WRONG!

This is a game where you FIGHT THE INTERFACE for 90% of the time.
And have to download many mods to help you in your fight.

My Morale = Broken.  (Screw this.)

6 1/2 hour later:  I am uninstalling.  Never looking back.

I have wasted hours of my time:

-Watching tutorials on how to do BASIC things.  (Like make my road curve left instead of right.)
-Googing how to get around game-breaking bugs.
-Attempting to build BASIC things like a road system without encountering the error ""Cannot build here, something already exists.""
-NO SOMETHING DOES NOT ALREADY EXIST IN THIS GRASSY FIELD!

THIS BUG - it was breaks it for me.  It promises nothing but pain.
The fact there is NO UNDO BUTTON (even though half of what you place ends up wrong...)
PROMISES MISERY

-What that message ""something already exists""  really means:

""We built a game so damn stupid that you cannot extend and connect roads.  
For basic additions to roads - demolish it all, and start again.  (Even if you just want to change curves.)
Building a freeway offramp?
Just TRY!  
No - we won't have that as something to select off-ramp-and-add.
NO!
Instead - we'll have a complicated ""manual select-and-draw"" system where you TRY to draw a curved off-ramp that connects with a road down at ground level.  

(Yes that is as bad as it sounds! Step right up folks, and give it a try! Guaranteed to make you pull your hair out in SECONDS!
Can you stand it?  Most can't last 5 minutes of this bull****, but can YOU?)

Take the Elevated Freeway Off-Ramp Challenge!

Curved-road tool won't allow you to curve in the correct direction.
Free-form tool won't allow you to curve in the correct direction either. 
You'll get the ""something already there!"" message ONCE YOU DRAW IT PERFECTLY.
OH YES.
Your freeway looks PERFECT now - but you can't PLACE the construction.
It's highlighted in RED.
What's already there?
Why...THE EXISTING FREEWAY!
That's right folks!

In order to have a nice, smooth curve...
(SO TRUCKERS DON'T GO PLUMMETING TO THEIR DEATHS OFF THE GUARDRAILS!)
You must 
A) Select where new road addition starts. (The off-ramp.)
This will be on the existing freeway.
B) Click on a place the road starts to curve 
On the existing freeway.
C) Click on the connector road to connect it.

BUT YOU CAN'T DO THAT! Ha-haaaaa!

""Something is alreay there.""
THANKS FOR PLAYING!  YOU LOSE!  Next player, step right on up!""

HOLY CRAP!
NO **** THE ELEVATED FREEWAY IS ALREADY THERE, GAME!
JUST IGNORE THE FACT WE DON'T NEED TO BUILD THE SECTION THAT IS ALREADY THERE AND MAKE THE OFF RAMP LEAVE IT A THIS POINT!

HOLY ****** WHY IS THIS DIFFICULT GAME?
It won't let you! 
HONEST TO GOD It won't let you add that off-ramp to the existing road with a curve!

You have to DEMOLISH the part of the freeway you want that curved exit-ramp to exist on.
You have to DEMOLISH the connecting road below!
You have to draw a HARD, STRAIGHT Y exit, not a curve, with the straight line tool.
Make it off-ramp into some grass (where that road used to exist.)
Now YOU MUST RE-DRAW THE ROAD ON THE GRASS DOWN THERE on ground-level.

Snapping tools exist - but GOOD LUCK getting it to LINE UP anyway!

HOLY CRAP PARADOX!  
Why couldn't you just make the roads CONNECT with 3 button clicks!!!!???
I should just click 

1) Where the exit ramp starts
2) Where it curves (to bend it)
3) Where it ends
(The road it connects to.)

AHHHHHHHH!


6 and a half FREAKIN' HOURS LATER AHHHHHHHHH!

My elegantly-designed freeway looks like DOG**** with a hard Y curve like a PEACE SIGN.
My ramps are too steep because I couldn't curve them.
ALL MY TRUCKERS ARE GOING TO DIE EXITING TOO FAST AND YANKING THE STEERING WHEEL TO EXIT.

(I google ""how to change road curve."")
I see tons of forum replies:
""Newb, you have to demolish all roads and structures nearby to make changes like connecting a road.  You can't just click on the ends of two roads and connect them all the time.  Demolish the ends of those roads first, add something in-between, then try to connect the other two gaps now.  You should now no longer get the error 'something already there' , newb.""

WHAT!

(Has stroke and uninstalls the game.)

............................

PUBLIC SERVICE ANNOUNCEMENT ON BUGS:

FYI:  When the camera locks on you, alt-tabbing out of the game fixes it.  Since I play windowed and have multiple monitors...I was screwed until I looked that up.

FYI: The camera sensitivity slider is broken. 
-Expect it to swing around wildly if you look left-right.
-You won't be able to look at the world from the angle you need to build.

I tried this game out on a free weekend first:
THANK GOD!"

21666,Actual good game
21667,"It's everything SimCity used to be, before EA bought and destroyed Maxis software."
21668,just one word for me. The best city building game i ever played
21669,"good
"
21670,Better than simcity
21671,relaxing game.
21672,"I absolutely love this game. I switched from a console to PC, and again-- I love it. I love the realism, easy access to mods to define your own city, and it's such an underrated experience for a game. I would definitely recommend it to anyone who is interested in architecture or city planning. The only thing I do struggle with is the balance between resolution and FPS. I unfortunately cannot balance to a point where I'm satisfied. Besides that, download this game!!"
21673,"THE FCKING ELEVATION CHANGE DOESNT FCKING WORFK!!!!! FCK!! I BROKE MY PAGE UP AND PAGE DOWN!!!!

EDIT: it was a mod.... but now i have 2 broken keys on my keyboard xd...."
21674,"Very nice game, 
but îts a DLC orgy with paradox cheap interactive hookers"
21675,Do you need $100 of DLC? Definitely not. You'll be cursing at pedestrians trying to cross your busiest roads for a dozen hours just fine in the base game.
21676,e
21677,it kicks the lamas ass
21678,"Excellent game, definitely worth it. The endless amount of free mods, etc. from the Steam Workshop make it even more amazing!"
21679,"May want to read the privacy policy...

Fine we are in the Online Age, that does not mean to play a game you need to get the games I play, real name, MAC address even, IP address, friend list on my steam, pages visited... 

I mean, is this a spyware or a game? If you collect the same exorbitant amount of personal details in a game like if we are on mobile then make the game free!

I was a bit surprised when prompted with that privacy policy a bit ""unusual"" and rightly so.

Really a game that belongs to mobile, plus 90 quid of DLCs, again...it belongs to mobile with all the ""energy"" ""gems"" and so on, you are better off playing Sim City 3000 and earlier versions."
21680,Send help...
21681,"I played this game for hundreds of hours on the xbox version. I had this game on my wishlist for months waiting for a sale here. its finally 80% off and playable for free for a few days on steam. I wanted it because i was very much looking forward to the workshop aspect of this game with a vast library of user created content. I grabbed the free version for the weekend, but it was too little too late. As played this game and all the DLC thats on sale, all i could think about how I would still be ripped off from buying this.

To clarify a bit, I enjoyed starting on one plot of land and being able to expand farther as my city grows. Its very in depth with the buildings and policies you would expect from this type of city builder. I enjoyed those hours i played on it and was hunting for the game to be lowered in price here. 

But the downfall was in all honesty SimCity. I pulled it out of my collection from 8 years ago, and not only does it hold up graphically to todays standards, but since i originally received the ultimate edition, I found extra dlcs unlocked that i had never played before, as i got a new computer a few months after the game came out and never reinstalled. I had everything unlocked from its one time price, so when i finally find this game which was taken off my wish list and given a publisher sale for the full game with all dlcs still ranging at $110, i said no thanks.

My huge thumbs down for this game is because of all those dlcs. i read in other reviews you can basically get around them with some of the workshop items, but to be fair i enjoyed adding on other sections to buildings in that ""other game"" to make it more unique and upgraded. I waited a long time for this game, and it was a week too late. Im saving myself some money and im going to enjoy i already have. Even if they are good dlcs, and other people do not consider it a rip off, I am not willing to buy them at a discount then recommend them to someone else at full price. I waited a long time to get this game on sale and the next person down the road shouldnt have to do the same. The base game may be worth $30 by itself, but even on sale im not giving them the $6 they want for it. Sorry guys, do better."
21682,city bankruptcy simulator
21683,It was a fun game but as of recently I have not been able to even launch the game. I launches for about 2 seconds then automatically quits the game. I've tried all of the fixes and nothing has worked. I want a refund
21684,game
21685,One of those games I just don't get tired of. :)
21686,"Very fun game, will definitely be paying when free trial ends.

It took me a hot minute to figure out basic navigation and building, but after that building great cities is a blast!
Also love the feature to unlimited money/unlock all buildings without having to use 3rd party mods."
21687,this is a good game
21688,"whats bigger? building 1 or building 2?

WRONG ITS A PRAJSJADJAJSDFAWEUFASDUFAUSDJCASN SFN ASNBD n nad najwr a

                     sorry everyone"
21689,"i built a city and accidentally activated cheats on it so i lost all my achievements, made a new city and got back to where i was then i forgot about this game"
21690,"yes
"
21691,insane gamplays
21692,"Really good game. Sometimes I see it on my library and I make a city. The bad thing is that you must use mods to make everything better. But apart from that, really good game."
21693,i have wasted too much time in this game... extremely addictive. Like SimCity but 1000x better
21694,"very fun, makes you be creative"
21695,"As a huge fan of sim-city, this is everything I could ever want. The base game, with no DLCs, already gives you hours upon hours of fun, leaving everything up to you. If you know what you're doing, (some mechanics can be somewhat complex from time to time, but once you learn a few they become applicable anywhere.), Theres always a point in the game where you have way too much money than you know what to do with, so you spend hours upon hours fixing traffic, buying monuments, making your city as perfect as can be. If you like simulation and management games, this is a must for you."
21696,Incredibly fun game. The type you can sink endless hours into without even realizing!
21697,YEYE GOOD LESS GO
21698,"One of the finest city builder sims. If you're into management games, this is a must play"
21699,"I have bought the game and all the DLCs. Me and my son we both loved this game and cannot stop playing as it makes us calm and relax, so in short we are looking forward to the next Cities Skyline game."
21700,yes.
21701,"I liked it,"
21702,poop city
21703,"Only making this review to to boost the overall rating of the game even more. This is easily one of my favorite games of all time, and as someone who is about to enter my masters program for city and regional planning, this game is to be thanked for inspiring me to be interested in the field in the first place."
21704,Nice
21705,Love the complexity. Feels like I am really building and looking after a city.
21706,yes
21707,.
21708,this game is taking all of my lifetime lol
21709,"If you really want to have fun with this game you need to buy lots of DLC packs. The complete DLC bundle is more than 200€ at the moment which is insane. Don't get fooled and buy the initial game for a few € while there is a big sale, you will soon be disappointed by the limited options."
21710,Its fun being god
21711,Its lit
21712,This game is just about getting a yes from me. The base game is incredibly shallow and quickly gets old. You need to spend a lot on the DLCs to flesh the game out making it into something worthwhile.
21713,funni poop lake go brrrt
21714,SimCity But Better and ParaSock DLC Scheme
21715,There's no mouse camera panning.
21716,Satisfaction.
21717,"Great game if you're into highly detailed control, or if you prefer to sandbox a beautiful or interesting city. 

Unfortunately, however, the game experiences periods where it crashes constantly (within 5 minutes of loading a city) over an over again (which, obviously, is super frustrating). Other times, however, it runs for hours without any issues."
21718,Best city builder game ever!
21719,Love this game
21720,BGE
21721,cheese
21722,FANTASTIC GAME FOR DESTROYING CITIES WITH METORS
21723,I refuse to believe they need 90$ worth of DLC
21724,"Play as the mayor, build as little or much as you want. Starts out slow then take off in this great city sim. Great for stress relief."
21725,"If you like cities and building cities, this game is for you."
21726,my dick remains untouched
21727,"I had a lot of fun playing SIm City back in the day, and this is definitely a more modern and up to date version. It is very fun and I feel like the possibilities are endless. I'm like I'll just play for a half hour, but then I lose track of time and play for like 3 hours haha"
21728,Great game that supports countless different play styles.
21729,"Probably has replayability if you download the DLCs.

Base game 7/10 worthy of buying on discount."
21730,"If you download a game that really, really sucks and you feel like you want to warn everyone from running into the same mistake and steam only allows you to only say nice things it feels like suffocating."
21731,"good game
"
21732,GAME IS GREAT.
21733,"Amazing game, one of the only pure city builders"
21734,Great. Best city sim there is in my opinion.
21735,I love traffic so much-
21736,jn
21737,"Unfortunately while this game is amazing, they go with the same model that Sims does. They release content that could easily be made for stupidly high prices but in tiny little DLCs. Wait for a 95% off and maybe it'll be worth it to get all the content. Otherwise it's as bad as micro transactions."
21738,uhhh it's an epic city builder and uhhhhhhhh spam temples everywhere
21739,Extremely good if you want to kill time
21740,"There are some essential mode like Move it and TMPE, but other that than it's perfect!"
21741,nice
21742,"I like it! I got it on sale for $8.  I probably wouldn't pay too much more for the base game since there's really not much to it.  It would be nice if you could build your cities bigger, but that's really my only complaint.  Good for a few hours of fun!"
21743,"Fun, at least for the first few hours."
21744,Awsome game. Could have bit more stuff without DLCS and mods though. Most important things missing like advanced traffic managment are free in mods.
21745,awesome
21746,"i bought this games premium edition at a GAME store on release, it got boring fast and i've only managed to hit 13 hours in 6 years, how to remedy that? spend more than the entire sim city franchise worth of money on DLC or play something else"
21747,immersive
21748,"Its gorgeous to look at close. The details on it are very good. Only tiresome fator is so many DLC if you don't pay for it, one cannot truly enjoy the game.Having said that its still quite a few things to do without paying anything more. One of the best City builders out there at present. Definitely worth it."
21749,Yum!
21750,THE BEST
21751,ok
21752,"One of my favorite games ever. Definitely the best city builder.
Why thumbs down?
The game got unplayable after installing many dlcs.
I have a good laptop, having no issues with games like the sims 4, mordhau, assassins creed origins, etc.
But this game crashes before it can even load. I can start it without mods, but it gets super slow. And honestly, cities is not thaaaat fun without mods."
21753,within the first 5 or 10 minutes I ran out of money making roads and adding water/power.  The game doesnt even tell you how to tax or make money which without it I cant do anything...
21754,"great game
it's a shame about the launcher though."
21755,Satisfies the city-builder cravings perfectly. Great game.
21756,"It is fun
"
21757,"Well I don't agree with 7$ bridges, this game needs those by default lol. Why do we have to pay $ for them?"
21758,"First you charge for bad music, now this? My love for sim city increased as the years go by; after my time with you, every output looks like an open sewage dump... one that wants more money.  Give your content creators due credit. Give them your 'hard earned money.' And of course, i'm spelling this out for you, because you were not listening. Great game, you suck. Pandemic just went by the way of blizz and a y(ea) to me. 

Was that what you wanted from your patronage? 1"
21759,Impressive simulation with unlimited creativity capabilities
21760,It is a very good game. if you like cities and building cities then this is for you. It is detailed and has infastructure that makes sense. There are good DLCs and alot of good mods and assets.
21761,"I am SO ADDICTED, HELP"
21762,"One of the most multifaceted games I ever played. Extremely addictive!
If you want more challenge, add mods!"
21763,Nice Game 110 hours in and still not bored...
21764,Jolly good.
21765,good game to kill a few hours on that is low impact and relaxing
21766,good game ngl like flooding my city with sewage and making cesspools. lmao
21767,YES
21768,Great game.
21769,"The possibilities in this game are endless, you can always find something new to do or try. 

Cons:
This game takes up A TON of power. I have a 2019 Macbook Pro with an 8 core I9 chip and the fans still run pretty damn hard when this game is running. MAKE SURE that your computer can handle the specs!!!!"
21770,"Great fun, Can be a relaxing way to burn some time."
21771,Is very gud!
21772,fun
21773,"i really like this game, i have played it on PS4 and the controls on it will have to be getting use to but the PC version is way better. there are more idea i like to add to cities: skylines but that can wait

i definitely recommend it to others if they like this type of game and type of game"
21774,"I miss the tech industry from sim city and being able to make computer chips and high end technology. But outside that everything is better here.

Also the launcher is trash but the game is very good.

And tons of mods in the workshop to cover all your needs. 9/10"
21775,"The game is good but kinda limited to few stuff like the public transport,agriculture and stuff but overall the game is good.I have just bought the standard game with no dlc but i think to enjoy the game more you would need the dlc's"
21776,Yes.
21777,"Had this game for ages, LOVE IT"
21778,tis fun
21779,Great Game!
21780,Cities: Skylines is a modern take on the classic city simulation. The game introduces new game play elements to realize the thrill and hardships of creating and maintaining a real city whilst expanding on some well-established tropes of the city building experience.
21781,"Great game, but would be nice if the DLC ever went more then 50% off...then again it is a paradox game."
21782,Paradox Interactive a DLC interactive experience
21783,nice cities
21784,"Just buy this game 3 weeks ago and now is Disc 80%.
Oh my god.."
21785,very epic
21786,"IT'S AMAZING
"
21787,"A very good game to build something and watch how it comes life. The DLC are good and are worth the price 
(unlike maybe Train Sim World 2). One minor problem with the game (especialy the industries DLC ) is that the Buildings are not very flexible wich kinda forces you to build a grid. Overall a very good game"
21788,Many hours of fun.........stuck in traffic
21789,This is by far the best city building game right now!
21790,"yes
"
21791,jugdirlvcdkfludi
21792,"I spent >1000 hours on this, guess this tells how much I enjoy this game."
21793,This game is ok but it hasnt changed much in many many years. they really need to come up with some new ideas to make it interesting again.
21794,"Forget Sim City, this is the one right now"
21795,No.1
21796,"Oooooooooh dear. Political statement time. I'm a big Sim City fan and I'm going to say - this is a great game. I like this game. I didn't like it quite enough to review it at the time, but I probably would have given it a lukewarm thumbs up - it plays pretty well as a city simulation. It's probably STILL a really good city simulator game. I'd really like to be playing it right now actually.

Except...Here's what I don't like about this game: Paradox Launcher. I don't know when this was added to the game but a recent reinstall to re-live the good times popped up with a strange Windows Installer dialog. Then the game opens up with a login screen. Strange. Then a spangly, shiny new EULA pops up with a spanky, flashy privacy policy. Oooooh.

NOPE. This is a classic bait-n-switch move and I ABSOLUTELY HATE THOSE. Darth Vader can get away with them because he's a Sith lord (and Lando is a pushover) but everyone else can just cut that nonsense out right now. This is a game that should be single player for the most part. C'mon, really? How many times have you engaged in an all-night-bender super-intense Twitch-streamed adrenaline-pumping video gaming session with 16 players...on a city simulator? You don't spawn-camp on highway intersections. I can't use a railgun to cut down midday traffic. Rocket jumping doesn't work if you're seat-belted into a minivan. No. This is not primarily a multiplayer game. I don't want access to your ""social club"". I don't want to talk to random people that have also built a city. That's not because I'm anti-social, it's because everybody hates walking into a surprise birthday party when they're in a bad mood, or if they just happen to be inappropriately modelling women's clothes at the time.

What's actually happened here is that the developers got into a boardroom and a conversation like this happened:

""So, I notice our online competition are harvesting customer data. They can sell it for MILLIONS!! MILLIONS!!!!!! WE WANT THAT TOO!!!""

Well...I say ""conversation"" but this was probably more like the CEO lapdog turned up at the team meeting and gave this incredible new eye-watering business strategy. The other side of the conversation was mostly made up of sighs, facepalms, or just the serene swaying creaky swoosh of programmers who have already tied the noose and hung themselves from the (tasteful) Swedish light fittings. This change is entirely driven by profit motives and absolutely nothing else. Nada. What's more is that I didn't agree to this at the time I bought this game and now I regard this game as ""bricked"". It's a brick. A mossy brick in a really old wall that would benefit from repointing. What's more is that after uninstalling this game it conveniently leaves the Paradox Launcher behind on your operating system. I should probably have checked to see if it installed as a startup app. Hey, maybe it was making connections to some foreign server and uploading the contents of my SSD, along with all those pictures of aforementioned women's clothes modelling sessions.

This is a disease. If Windows 3.11 were re-released today you can expect to see Paradox Launcher before you play Minesweeper. Some things just don't need to be online.

9/10 Really good city simulator.
Sigh/10 Llama and spline reticulation references.
-inf/10 Really dick move on the EULA guys.

That said, if you're the kinda person that's okay with surprise EULAs, or you don't mind having more passwords than there are atoms in the visible universe, you might want to try this. It's not for me though. Not anymore."
21797,3
21798,peenis
21799,One of the best City Simulator Game.
21800,good
21801,Make every road an arterial road and it will solve all of your issues.
21802,good
21803,Its average.
21804,"its fun if you like the prospect of building a city, has some problems though"
21805,"This one is easily my personal favourite. No problem spending 10-12 hours on this game. Only recently played on Steam version which explains why the number of hours played still low. 
Steam version has workshop for mods , for beginners just install TMPE mod and you all good :)"
21806,Fantastic game
21807,"Can be a bit of a cash grab but it's as easy as not buying DLC's that I don't want. Either way when I buy a new DLC it ends up giving me hours of gameplay to figure how it works and how it can look good in the city so I feel that the cost is justified. Also the abundance of mods and assets makes the game 10x better, thanks to all the creators for that!

But if you don't have a decent PC don't bother until you do get one lol"
21808,better than sim city thats for sure
21809,It's ok. I don't have time remaining to play anything else now though.
21810,Will sell liver for City Skylines 2
21811,cool
21812,"Its a great game however the engine is severly lacking; the great performance you see on the prerecorded video os the product? No you wont get it, no matter what hardware you throw at it. After you get some nice city with skyscrappers and public transportation its gonna go 30fps or less even on 720p"
21813,I was introduced to Cities: Skylines by another keen gamer. I absolutely love it! A lot of strategy involved and so many maps and mods to choose from.
21814,"great game but, WHERE THE FUCK DID THEY GET THEIR LICENCES???? FUCKIN BRAMPTON?????"
21815,"great fun screwing around, however if your computer isnt good adjust the settings a bit, and also add some optimization for lower end pcs."
21816,Hands down the best city management simulator out there. Can't wait for next iteration!
21817,"The community around this game is delightful. I want to lead with that because it matters. There is high collaboration, mutual support and camaraderie. It's refreshing. 

If you've never played a City Builder, This particular one is as much a hobby, like model trains or giant LEGO builds, as it is a ""game.""  Watch some videos from some of the top streamers. They have a lot of insight that will help you make awesome builds and minimize frustration. 

Workshop content like mods make the game much much more fun and previously tedious tasks, convenient. But the stability of the game can get dodgy at times. It is critically important to read the comments on any and all workshop content. There are even mods that can spit out logs for errors checking and mods who's job it is to check all your mods and make sure they're all playing nice with each other. Use them.  Loading times, even with few mods can get VERY long as cities grow and the game can absolutely chew through your memory, too. Would highly recommend no less than 32G of RAM. (It'll run with decent frame rates, but the sim its self will run more slowly) It'll just seem like it's in slo-mo even with 60+fps"
21818,Great Game! Really recommend it!
21819,It's good but more of a network simulator. I still find myself going back to Simcity 4 with mods.
21820,Best City building game ever. With the amazing community there is tons of free mods also in the workshop! If you want to build some epic cities then this game is for you.
21821,Best city builder in the world. Made even greater by the best modding community in the world.
21822,"In essence, this game is SimCity on steroids. Like most Paradox-published games, Cities: Skylines allows the player incredible control over different aspects of the game, from planning bus lines to creating sprawling overpasses and entire road networks, to creating your own National Park (that last one is DLC-locked unfortunately). All around this is a solid game, and one of the, best, if not the best city planning game on the market today."
21823,"Ibought this on PS$ first at launch. in 2020 I bought the Mayor edition on sale. at this point i had spent nearly $200 on this game.
then i bought it on PC. mods and framerate are awesome. I still play more on ps4 because i have all the content, but pc is a better experience. regardless, clearly a worthwhile buy if you like city builders. INCREDIBLY in depth as you could ask, or as simple as you need."
21824,"Nice relaxing game where one calmly constructs and grows their city from a hamlet of brainlets into a megalopolis that somehow has less people living in it than Davenport, Iowa."
21825,"I killed a lot of people
i'm not talking about the game"
21826,another Paradox gem
21827,"So I revisited the game again, and I still don't recommend it. The problem is that the game requires so many mods to be barely functional. Why aren't traffic manager and road manager in vanilla !?"
21828,"After pouring thousands of hours into this game;
It's finally time to buy this game."
21829,
21830,"The best city-builder game out there, by a large margin. Also has an awesome community and plenty of updates."
21831,"gud gam
"
21832,"Love the great content, creators community, that the developers allow flexibility for true creation. Always loved the city builders since Sim City 1 on SNES, but after EA games wrecked anything good to come out of the Sim City franchise. I was unable to find anything in city simulation genre worth a look; until I found this gem, and it does well to allow me to pass the time. The game A.I. and physics (cause and effect) is just awesome. Keep on buildin'."
21833,"well.. the game is awesome. with that said. I'm not happy with the graphics smoothness. (probably my pc, so no ill feelings) What chaps my hide (its all about timing) is that this game went on sale 80% 2 days after i paid full price. 2 days!! but I digress. good game. 

2 days!!"
21834,Another good game :)
21835,"If you Enjoy Sim City 2000/3000, this is a welcome step up."
21836,"Traffic management simulator. You're forced to create cities a certain way to get around traffic problems. Vehicles do not figure out shortcuts or use alternative offramps to get to their destination faster. Instead they like to all follow the shortest distance from point A to B which creatures traffic jams at particular offramps and leaving others just a short distance away empty.

In real life knowing your local area is key to minimizing your commute times. For example, I take many exits and use many roads on a daily basis that technically increases my distance traveled, but my traveling time is significantly reduced because I am aware of how dense traffic is on certain roads depending on the time of day. Also important to take into consideration is the amount of traffic lights and intersections you will travelling through. Obviously the less lights and intersections you have to travel through the faster you will reach your destination.

This kind of complexity needs to be added to the traffic AI in this game. As far as I know it's very basis point A to B logic."
21837,"way too many paid dlcs, but the vanilla game is still fun."
21838,"Ugh I keep wanting to come back to the game for new content but I don't want to play the ""buy 100 DLC"" game. Either utilize a season pass or lower the bundle of all DLCs from $184... which will just keep getting more expensive. Pretty dang greedy for a 6 year old cash cow."
21839,haha traffic go brrrrrrrrrr
21840,Creativity and strategy
21841,good game
21842,good
21843,"op game 
"
21844,"A really in-depth city building game that you can either freely build or have a very easy-to-understand progression. Mods are plentiful, so there's always a new asset to add."
21845,ahead
21846,"Tips for Beginners: 
Ignore ""need more (educated) workers"" as long as you have enough schools
Buy the DLCs off eneba/ any steam keys website as they're usually way cheaper."
21847,Won't work if you have Citrix Workplace on your computer.  Can't get the work arounds to work.  I'm not removing the virtual portal to my job to play a video game.  The studio should fix this.  Glad I tried on a free to play weekend or I would be very upset.
21848,"I've only just skimmed the surface, but this a fantastic city simulator, and will keep me busy for months. Wish I'd know about during Covid."
21849,Only if you are willing to sink way too much money in DLC.
21850,"A really great city building sim! TON of features that I'm yet to scratch the surface of. Admittedly there is a bit of a learning curve, so keep that in mind. Most similar game I played was Tropico, and this has way more depth to it."
21851,!!!
21852,"Better than any Simcity 4 with all it's tools. Love the game. 
"
21853,"takes a while to get used to the controls, but has a lot of options available to make the city how you want."
21854,"good stuff

21862,i like this game. and i hope to see the developer put some work in the AI or the population to make them more realistic..
21863,Hey guys city skylines is a great building game. This game has changed my life i have always wanted to play City Skyline. i dream of this game. for get Sim City. This game will blow your mind.

21864,Un jeux magnifique dont on ne se lasse pas.
21865,Best city builder i played yet.
21866,If you haven't played this game and you enjoyed any version of SimCity in the past... This is better! Better than any of them!
21867,"Amazing Game, Can't stop playing for hours"
21868,+++
21869,"Grate Game! Keep the work up! i have only 1 problem. can you make there be deserts and bigger maps?
other than that awesome game i had this game for 3 years


i know that this is a city building game but i wish that you can put these zoning types into the game...
these are the types township (with a township hall), county (and you can zone the county main city), state (with capitals), countries (with the capital like the US has Washington DC). thats it for now! love the game"
21870,"Addicted, good gameplay, best city building simulation game I ever played."
21871,Great game especially with mods
21872,gucci
21873,its fun but you need dodge build to survive the disasters
21874,"Me with my little establishment of a town:

21878,"CS IS VERY FRIENDLY TO SIMCITY4 PLAYERS, CITY FOUNDATION ESTABLISHMENT IS IMPORTANT FOR DEVELOPMENT AND GIVE UP UR DIRTY NARROW MEDIEVAL VILLAGE MIND.
--------------------------------------------------------------
对于SIMCITY4的中国玩家来说，全程无压力海量高清MOD，现在打折也许是该入手的时候了。游戏中规划你的城市放弃固守观念，一旦开局就停不下来，清按照城市规划思路来建造，水电污水处理要先做好，跑马占地主干道路先铺双车道泥巴路，建议全是双车道，成为巨型城市到时候还得拆；城市按照民居/市场/工业区划分，工业区和垃圾场等污染单位离居民区远一些；接下来会解锁新建筑来完善市镇功能，当支出正向再考虑道路和扩建周边区域，相信很快就能上手。"
21879,idk it has a lot of dlcs
21880,very realistic game. you can do whatever you want and its not boring. keps you alive in game.
21881,You build shit
21882,"Very epic, after 500 hours I got bored."
21883,sick
21884,good game.. worth the time an money
21885,"Even though the SimCity franchise lost its way decades ago, this game carries on the tradition."
21886,"The game is good tho, but traffic arrangements is kinda suck or difficult idk. over all game is good, i recommended."
21887,"Amazing game!  Reminds me of my childhood dream cities in Sim City 2000!  The newer Sim Cities were much more difficult for me to figure out; kept losing so much money I couldn't ever expand.  In this game, it is tricky, but much more realistic and entertaining!  Very fun and addicting game!  Thank you!"
21888,"good,but not good"
21889,"yea its pretty good m8

i like getting a save of my city then using the Natural Disasters DLC to collapse my neighbor's house"
21890,"Game is dope, fun city builder"
21891,"l
"
21892,Great city building game
21893,A very good city-building game. I recommend this to anyone who played SimCity 4 and wants something more recent.
21894,"Cities: Skylines is a very relaxing and creative game that allows players to build a city out of their imagination. with what seems like hundreds of options when it comes to things to build such as Parks, Wonders, Services and Roads. much of the world is flexible when it comes to angling, rotating or snapping things together too.

The game also includes Mods which can add even more buildings and maps and much more."
21895,Very Engaging and fun game
21896,No idea of whether the game is any good or not since you can't get past the agreement reading step.  Lousy demo if the first fatal error occurs before you even get the game opened.
21897,i blew up multiple familys. 10/10
21898,"The biggest and best city-building simulation available right now despite being over 5 years old. If you liked Sim City, you'll probably love this."
21899,"So far, one of my favorite games ever. I love messing around in sandbox mode, attempting(and failing) to make something decent in the regular mode, and then flooding my city. 5 stars. One of the best city-building games."
21900,"It's a scam. Don't buy it unless you wanna sell your soul to Paradox
"
21901,"New privacy policy allows them to sell your information. I bought this game, this is utter BS."
21902,"There is a reason there havent been any other modern city builders to come out in the last 5 years or so. City Skylines has become the definitive city building simulator. SimCity failed to stay true to its roots and the dedicated following it had, instead opting  for a Live Service game with restricted features. City Skylines is a terrific city builder and a plethora of DLC that only enhances the original release."
21903,"This is a challenging strategy game that gives you the ability to create and manage a city as you see fit. It can be frustrating, especially at first. Best thing is to learn from others, which I did frequently. Note that there is no point at which you can declare victory. You can continue to build and change your city for as long as you wish. I enjoyed building various industries and unique factories. Others may wish to focus on tourism or education or ""green"" technology. My advice: don't give up to soon. Explore and see how things can be made to work better."
21904,i love just love it
21905,"Make cities that barely work, but you are proud of. Go online and see masterpieces. Cry. Try again. 

Mod friendly."
21906,"You build a whole city and can do whatever you want, what more do I have to say"
21907,"What Sim City should have evolved into, but didn't.  Paradox has improved upon the legacy!"
21908,is good
21909,"It has a ton of option content via DLC, but don't let that overwelm you because the base game is fantastic alone and if you find that isn't enough you can always get the dlc to start expanding your arsenal."
21910,"Good, but the DLC is WAY too expensive.  $200 for the complete game?  Are you joking?  It's six years old, it should be $20 for everything."
21911,This is a really good game and worth £25
21912,"Initially...? LOTS of fun! Simple. Go to Steam, hit Play. Play game. Now? In two words... ""Paradox Launcher"". Fuck that. Does anyone even READ the ""license agreement"" when it automatically installs this pointless launcher? The *ONLY* reason it is there is to steal your personal info, keep an eye on everything you are doing, and report that back to them to do with whatever they please.

!!! See my UPDATE, below about how to 'bypass"" this launcher with a simple program someone created to do just that. No muss, no fuss. (And no malware or virus according to my multiple checks...and it's on GitHub, with source, so...yeah...)!!!

Why, Paradox? Are you just that fucking greedy and neurotic? Why can't just just let someone make a fun game, let them give you money, and be done with it? What give's you the right to force a customer to be chained to your personal desires for all time? The whole ""commerce"" concept is REALLY simple: You make something I want. I give you money for it. We shake hands and you are happy you have money, I am happy I have your product...and we NEVER HAVE TO SEE OR DEAL WITH EACH OTHER EVER AGAIN! Yet, somehow, the 'digital world' (re: publishers, mostly) seem to think a customer giving them money also entitles them to private details of that customer as well as spy on everything they do. Forever.

Nope. I'm out. DO NOT BUY THIS GAME! Make a statement. Until we (gamers/consumers) grow a pair, it's only going to get worse. In 20 years companies will be forcing people to let them log into any and all digital devices and signals, phones, video cams, smart appliances, etc, to watch and listen to them... ""to better serve them"". Think I'm crazy? yeah...get back to me in 20 years and we'll see..."
21913,"Love this game! I ""lost"" a lot of hours playing it and the time passes so quick! Lots of things to do, and a lot of attention to detail. The Workshop is the best part, letting people adding stuff to the game! Well done!"
21914,"awesome

21920,"I spent $30 on this game and 2 days later it was on sale for $6. 

Do not ever pay full price for this game. Steam refused to refund the game because I had 7 hours played on it. 

Never buy games at full price it's always better to wait for sales especially with that drastically different price. 

Thanks again for ripping me off steam."
21921,"Great game, absolute recommendation!"
21922,its awsome
21923,"I played Sim City as a child, and I love this game."
21924,"Step 1 Build city 
Step 2 Solve first traffic issues
Step 3 Realize that you caused more issues by fixing the first traffic issue
Step 4 Try to fix second traffic issue causes even more traffic issues
Step 5 Cry
Step 6 Watch city burn 
Step 7 Start a new city"
21925,Great fun
21926,I'm no longer able to play a great game I bought a few years ago without having to buy DLC. Such a shame.
21927,I made a lake of shit
21928,city went bankrupt in 3 minutes nice
21929,Truly Incredible Game!
21930,gameplay is a litter bit complex but worth a try ;)
21931,Great game.
21932,Very nice game
21933,bueno
21934,So much fun. Can get lost in the world
21935,Its pretty good.
21936,yes
21937,it starts as a city building sim and then it turns into the worlds finest traffic manager
21938,"Never played a sim like this before and wanted to play it because of RTgames and Jschlatt, good for wasting hours. 
"
21939,"i suck at make city, bad gam >.> no water?????????"
21940,fun
21941,"A fantastic gem of a game! easy to play, but difficult to master and there's constant updates and new content, the dlc is getting more and more sketchy, but that seems to be the way of things nowadays"
21942,"I've played and sunk hundreds of excellent hours into city builders from Sim City back in the day to Tropico to Survivng Mars etc.
I really thought this vvould be a great one but I find the controls to be very unintuitive, perhaps the game vvas made for my evil opposite tvvin as nearly everything I've tried to do has had a 180 degree effect.
Combined vvith the evil-empire stance they've taken on data collection I am left quite dissatisified.
Perhaps you'll enjoy this in a vvay I couldn't.
This is the first game I've purchased vvhere I'll seek a refund."
21943,"When Simcity dropped the ball with citybuilding games Finnish developer Colossal Order came and took the ball. They ran all the way to the TD line and scored like true mothersnatcher.
Cities: Skylines is a masterpiece in citybuilding. If you love the genre you will love this game. Go get it."
21944,"Great game, max hygge"
21945,Best city builder game on the market rn
21946,"Even Better on PC, A must buy, i would recommend Green City, Natural Disaster, and Sunset Harbor as your DLC. In my opinion it is the leading city builder game currently on the market."
21947,"This is an amazing game. It's hard to say more. The amount of creativity, especially once you get into the mods that let you get detailed down to how the intersections work. I've spent almost 90 hours playing this and it's not ending anytime soon. 10/10"
21948,You can build a city but... We can also determine a huge amount of things to the point of accuracy precisely such as the entire flow of traffic (huge options for roads) and the entire water canal. These little things where you can determine exactly how you want things to look and work are the reason this game is different from other City Builder games.
21949,"As someone who has only really played Minecraft, I'm finding Cities: Skylines to be really enjoyable. Thoroughly recommend to players of all ages. 
"
21950,"To anyone that has played the other sim city games, this is a nice refresh of an old classic. The style and setup is basically the same. But you are dealing with computers that can do much more so it is more detail intensive. That is a plus! For a newbie, I could see how it could be a bit confusing at first. But To anyone that was thinking about buying an old windows xp laptop just to play sim city 2000, save your time. Get this game. Worst case scenario, you will have spent 2 cents per hour to entertain yourself. Graphics are great. I only spent less than an hour on it and I am already happy with my purchase. Sim city games have been hard to find since windows 10 just about killed them. This is a sight for sore eyes. It will be my downfall  :)"
21951,This game is banger
21952,Like SimCity but it's 2021? Play this.
21953,"This game has become my favorite citybuilder of all time and I've been playing since the original Sim City days.  I tend to play it intensely for weeks, then go off and do other things for a year or two until I start craving it again.  I've enjoyed the majority of the expansions as well though I am not sure I've taken full advantage of some of them yet.  It seems other people are much better at making pretty cities than I am but it's still highly addictive.  

While it's still tons of fun vanilla, it really shines with a few select mods (the unlock 25 region mod is pretty much a must for me) and a reasonable amount of custom content.  Be careful though about downloading too much from the workshop, if you get too much custom content for your system to handle sometimes you have to do a full clean install to reset.  Also be careful of assets that are non-performant, pro-tip: a warning symbol is displayed next to these in the content manager, I recommend checking for that symbol anytime you download new content and immediately remove those assets before they cause problems in your game."
21954,Love this game
21955,ඞඞඞඞඞඞඞඞඞඞඞ soooo their was this one country that shall remain unnamed but lets say the leader had a very unique moustache yeah thats how i play this game just like him ඞඞඞඞඞඞඞඞඞ wow holy amogis emote ඞඞඞඞඞඞඞඞඞ moustache man was the imposter ඞඞඞඞඞඞඞඞඞඞ
21956,Best City Builder
21957,"Ok game. 
"
21958,I get it. I get the deal with airline food.
21959,Yes
21960,"If you use Citrix, then this game will not run.

The official solution:
“The solution is (for the time being) to uninstall Citrix Workspace as this will enable you to run the game/s as normal again. (…)”
https://support.paradoxplaza.com/hc/en-us/articles/360019138814-Citrix-Workspace-and-Unity-games

Game is great, unfortunately, for some weird reason, there is a bug that prevents this game from running if you have Citrix Workspace installed. This is a work-related tool, so the proposed solution to uninstall Citrix is obviously not an option for me. There are some “work arounds” but they either require weird installation of Citrix that needs the IT departments permission to install, or require the force use of opengl driver, but this also causes some issues with menu interactions & occasionally black screens.

Supposedly this is due to Unity engine bug that got patched in 2018…. 
https://forum.unity.com/threads/problem-with-citrix-workspace.589342/

Weird bug, but I cannot recommend the game until they properly fix this.
"
21961,The game is very fun. It's easy to lose track of time when you're trying to design a successful city. I've poured a lot of time into it already. I keep coming back. It's been great.
21962,"Whether you want to play vanilla or choose to take advantage of the insane number of mods in the Workshop, this game provides hours upon hours of customization and micro-managing. Cities: Skylines is like SimCity on steroids. Even after taking a few breaks here and there, I find myself being sucked back in when the itch arises and the rabbit hole due to ideas, attention to detail and ability to modify nearly every part of the game is near infinite."
21963,good game i like it
21964,"Shitty Game
Recommended"
21965,"Grew up with Sim City, this is adults version of Sim City!"
21966,"An improved version of SimCity without a doubt.
The game already offers a lot, for inexperienced people in building cities, for those who ARE experienced, and those who are looking for a chill game to play in the background of doin hw ( im 2 of these :D ). 

This is disregarding all the mods that the community has to offer! They and the DLC just makes it 100x better to want to play this game."
21967,"It's very well , I love this game"
21968,"Love it! I could play this for hours, I get that into it. Easy to understand once you get into it, but I have to admit it was a little frustrating for me in the beginning. It's challenging enough to keep my attention and that's saying a lot! I suggest this game for those who like sim like games or are interested in city management."
21969,"Best city building game to this day. Got it with all the DLC's on Humble Bundle. The community creates great mods and assets that adds everything the dev's haven't thought of, or is too heavy to release on every platform. And the studio pushes the best mods and collaborate with the creators, making an amazing community! If you find a Bundle with all the DLC's, I higly recomand getting it, otherwise buying them one by one is a bit too expensive. The vanilla game is better than other city builders, but when you add the DLC's and the mods, it becomes far superior on many levels, especially for realism."
21970,"A good City Builder simulator to have in your collection. I'm not a Professional Critic, so forgive me if I don't put in the effort of giving you a run down of what's good and what's not good. It's good, so enjoy it. Peace out. Be safe."
21971,"very good city builder game and i would recommend but i have 1 issue that follows:
i'm always playing the same maps and that gets boring because there's no change in map every time, that's why i would like to suggest a map generator which would essentially create a new random map for a different playing experience. Now i know i'm asking much but this could solve boredom among players from playing the same maps over and over."
21972,It is a very cool game and i really like it i would love for more people to play this game
21973,this is a fun sandbox game that allows you to just have fun
21974,"Great game but I wish the full bundle was affordable, £133 is a ridiculous ask.."
21975,Cool game that contracted lethal marketing cancer on part of Paradox becoming increasingly insane over the past decade
21976,good game
21977,"Definitely recommend it
"
21978,"I have well over 1,000 hours in this game if you count console. This is the single best game for building modern civilizations."
21979,If you like building games. This is a Must!
21980,yup
21981,hmm yes very city
21982,"definitely one of the best city builders out there

pretty fun, but difficult at the same time
had a hard time understanding everything at first
but after that, you can can do millions of things
recommend downloading mods to handle traffic better, ext.
one of my favorite games, worth the price

9.5/10

21983,"Like simcity, but much better"
21984,"it's incredibly fun and relaxing, I just love it. It's totally worth the money"

21986,"Surprisingly engaging, not usually a big fan of city builder sims
"
21987,very smooth and realistic graphics
21988,fun
21989,is good
21990,roads
21991,Cities: Skylines is a great simulation game/puzzle game. I can lose so many hours into this... You can really get creative and you'll need to because it's actually quite difficult.
21992,My favorite city builder by far. Great value as well.
21993,This game is really fun
21994,cool roads n shit
21995,fuck the traffic
21996,I liked the way the program builds complexity slowly.
21997,Been playing this game for years and tho im not as good as some players out there its still fun
21998,"I have owned this game for quite some time now and still enjoy it. Cities Skylines can be a sandbox builder or grind your way up to a metropolis tycoon simulator. I personally enjoyed both game modes for many hours. The devs in this game keep delivering, and encourage modding. Which in my opinion is what keeps this game interesting even after being out for six years. Even if you want to play vanilla, the game is plenty fun. I personally find After Dark, Snowfall, Park Life, and Mass Transit to be supplemental to my builds. Great game for those who like to build cities or have a laid back strategy game."
21999,Simcity on steroids!
22000,A peaceful game.
22001,poop volcano
22002,give 20 percent tax for 30 seconds noone notice and i get lots of money
22003,Best city building game out there as far as I'm aware.
22004,It's like SimCity on steroids.  Lots of customization and things to manage.
22005,p
22006,Better than Sim City
22007,bad
22008,I wanted to play for a couple of hours and now it's been a week without playing anything but Cities Skylines.

22011,Its pretty good
22012,CITY
22013,"Awesome, addicted."
22014,we built this city
22015,I feel like I've spent no time at all (and have bought all of the DLCs mostly) and yet have restarted my city like 9 times. Little to say I love this game (even if my computer doesn't run it as well as I would like). Cannot wait to see this game evolve over time.

22026,Best city building game forever!
22027,"you will have big dreams but your city will be ass, but play it anyway because it kills time, a lot. And its fun"
22028,This game is absolutely brilliant
22029,"Better than sim city, thats for sure"
22030,"Great game... what Sim City should have eventually become but never did, Only flaws are that the game is limited by the power of modern computer technology.  Has a lot of great mods people have created also but the vanilla game is still good enough on its own."
22031,"Amazing game, amazing community. 

I could spend forever in this game, a fun experience dlc or not and vanilla or not. There's plenty to do in this game if you're big on management and city building. I spend a lot of time mircomanaging things and it's super fun!"

Highly recommended, if you want to try your had at city building - this is the one!"

It ca be difficult sometimes as you need a computer made for gaming, as it doesn't hold up very well on a lot of traditional laptops or computers.

22050,This is a gleat game
22051,DOPE!!!!
22052,"Even with mods, road placement is too infuriating to even get to the actual game. I actually have no idea what the game actually is like because I've spent my entire play time just trying to get roads even remotely close to how I want them, failing, then restarting because I've spent half my startup funds building and bulldozing.

This game is probably great for people who don't have whatever special blend of undiagnosed mental disorders I suffer from, but for me, this is the equivalent of slamming my dick in a car door repeatedly, as are most video games, honsetly, so I have no idea why I keep buying them."

22057,"Mods. Vanilla game is lame, lacking, and kinda broken. Mod it like crazy and this is basically the best city builder ever.

Nexl, Move It, Traffic Manager President Edition, there are so many out there."
22058,"Great game, def worth a pick up if you like these style games. 10 out 10 would buy again, only need one more DLC."
22059,"you get to build a nice little city and then tax them into oblivion like real life
"
22060,
22061,It's pretty good.
22062,The SIM City I always wanted.
22063,Game used to be fine. Now it wants me to install Paradox Launcher and accept bunch of Privacy Policies that I don't want to accept. On top of that - thanks to the Launcher it won't install/add any DLC that I paid for.
22064,"This is a great civilization game, there is many great things about this game, from how real it gets to how some situations just play right into your own hands!"
22065,"Yup, good game."
22066,vrum vrum has car good
22067,"Good. Who cares about the broken mechanics when you can do so much,"
22068,"Fun game. Best city builder out there.
I bought it on Steam and then got it for free on Epic Games like 2 years later."

22071,The game is amazing.
22072,"Paradox, so expect nothing but the base game and to pay, as of now, $177 for everything they left out."
22073,good
22074,Love it!
22075,everything
22076,"This is the perfect game for people who want to get into the ""builder""/""simulation""/""management"" due to the following:

-The game is quite clear and enjoyable visually, making the player being able to focus on the ""management"" part of the game while having some good visuals that make the game feel enjoyable but not too distracting.
-The gameplay mechanics get implemented through the game on an easy to learn way.
-The game has some clear limits, but thanks to the community those limits are nearly unrecheable as there are mods that can modify visually the game, but also add more depth to it.
-There are lots of youtube and steam guides for new players.

As a summary, totally worth it.

Here you have some gameplay of the game: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6zvsWaYMRc"
22077,Very relaxing game
22078,Neat
22079,"This used to be a fun game that's easy to run. Now with the bundled game launcher and countless dlcs, this game is getting very clunky - to the point that trying to load a vanilla map without mods would crash the game on a machine with 16G of ram. 

Paradox should really move on to a new project and let mod creators take over, instead of trying to milk this game till the bitter end."
22080,epic louis moment
22081,"Best city builder out there, nothing else comes close."
22082,"Fun game. can be challenging at times, but that just makes it more fun!"
22083,i let all of my people die through two hundred asteroids... great :)
22084,Very good to pass the time
22085,"A great city builder, with tons of freedom to design your city how you want. both easy to understand, but with a lot of complex systems if you're into a more complex experience. the workshop and modding capabilities are insane, everything you could ever ask for has a mod, or an asset. all in all, really worth your money!"
22086,"Awesome game, I love almost all Paradox games and Cities Skylines is just fantastic. Seing your city grow and making your population happy is one of the best feelings you can have playing video games. Although, Cities Skylines is much better with its DLCs, and sometimes you get sad that you can't do things you see other people do with the expensive DLCs, like awesome costumised parks, different lanes or whatever all other 20 DLCs have to offer."
22087,Best city building sim by far
22088,"be careful when you demolish abandoned buildings, i keep demolishing the wrong ones"
22089,Should call this game DLC: Skylines. No thanks
22090,Very fun game with lots of diverse ways to spend your play time.
22091,"Best city builder ever.
Many times better the late Maxis creation."
22092,Nice to relax and enjoy some planning
22093,"The cities become unstable at ca. 150,000 residents."
22094,fun game
22095,"Best city sim to date. Mods are almost essential for traffic, but there are a ton of great ones that only enhance the game."
22096,"Almost everything you could want in a city builder in the game and what's missing is usually found in the ample mods and assets. If this is any indication then I'd be prepared to preorder a sequel to this game.

Seriously, the biggest fault with this game is that it's 6 years old now and despite how good it is, the technical limitations that are a function of the age surely mean we're ready for a sequel. How about it Paradox/CO?"
22097,fun
22098,"This game is about Thinking good, Like you're the mayor of a small city, and want to expand with limited money."
22099,This is the most addictive game I've ever played. All the DLC and mod content make it a seemingly endless source of discovery.
22100,Awesome City Building Game. Truly engaging.
22101,"Bruh
"
22102,"A dope ass game build for me ^^ i like City Building since i was a kid in the 90s :* with Simcity 2000 :D
being able to do what i want, import Vheacles and stuff, rename tha damn roads to that i want, and namies from people, cars and deers even ^^ THATS FOR ME, if you want to be a boss then this is for you, you can do what evs you want here :D"
22103,"Very good open-ended sandbox game with lots of variety and building styles. DLCs are also good fun and worth buying. The workshop will ensure that any idea you have will definitely be possible.

I recommend a decent to high-end PC and definitely getting the mods that optimise performance, however, as this game can tank even newer devices (my mid-range 1 year-old laptop struggles immensely)"
22104,Fun and satisfying
22105,Get the undo mod and road anarchy. I cannot express to you how useful these mods are.
22106,"fun
"
22107,I have a problem where when I play this game I don't shower as much. I don't clean as much. I don't socialize as much. This is the crystal meth of city building games.

22115,Yes
22116,idk
22117,sucks
22118,"Now that I've played for a few hours, I think it's safe to say that this is a great game whether you play Vanilla, with DLCs or with the massive amount of mods and assests available on the workshop. Highly recommend this to anyone even remotely interested in city builders."
22119,Amazing game.
22120,still wondering if this game is worth my time
22121,gud
22122,"I don't know that there's a better city sim out there right now, and it's probably going to stay that way until C:S 2. it really is that simple"

22125,game good
22126,Best game ever
22127,"YOUR MOM XDDDDDDDDDD
"
22128,"One of my most played games. This game is great if you love creation and city planning. The base game with no mods is eh, but with DLC and mods it's 100% worth putting time into. From figuring out traffic problems to zoning commercial and residential areas, this is a great city planning game. I tell people who are interested that basically you need a few DLCs from the start. I purchased the game and quickly discovered the workshop and DLCs. Paradox has not failed on DLC content, it's worth it every time and they deserve full price for them. The workshop is fantastic with user created content and a constant addition of new workshop mods. My entire game is not stock at all, almost every DLC and thousands of mods installed. Of course with that brings lag. I completely understand the lag and don't blame the game at all. I have a Intel i5-9600k and a RTX2070 and it is a struggle as you build on. Overall great game and I always look towards to new content from Paradox."

22147,Best city building game available. I feel like I can be fully creative and constantly entertained by everything that is happening because of the realism. No other game gives me this feeling. The mods make it even more realistic and enjoyable to  see everything happen. It is one of my favorite games and I always come back to it because the level of creativity and the output creates immense excitement. You really do feel like you've created a real city while playing this game.
22148,it's dope
22149,"If you look out at a road, and office park, or a mass transit system and say to yourself, ""if I were mayor this city would be so much better"" then this is the game for you. If you like to micromanage, build and destroy, or iterate and improve then this game is for you. If you like building networks and watching them come to life then give this a try. I was a big fan of the first simcities back in the distant distant past and this game is basically that on steroids. Its provided me literally weeks of entertainment...like literally weeks I'm almost 400 hrs in."

22175,nice
22176,"If you enjoy city building games, Cities Skylines' extensive mod support makes it one of the best out there today. In my experience, it's best played with the DLC packages, which thanks to Paradox's publishing model are somewhat overpriced. I recommend against paying full price for the DLCs. Also of note, Cities Skylines is a game that requires intense amounts of RAM. If you have less than 16gb, the game is going to struggle for you (and I highly recommend more)."
22177,If you loved SimCity you will really love this one.
22178,You can mod everything in this game
22179,"This is a pretty satisfying City builder but it can get out of hand easily (not as easily as Banished, mind you). The amount of DLC alone should probably scare you away but if you manage to get the base game for $10 then go for it, it's good fun until you unlock the rather sparse number of basic structures."
22180,"One of the coolest and most passionate communities ive even seen for a builder-type game!

Workshop still active as ever 6 years after release and cool devs"

22191,"This game is a time vampire, and a damn good one at that!"
22192,"Honestly addicting. Should probably stay away. The vanilla game is great, but the ease of adding additional content through subscriptions has compelled me into 81 hours in 5 days, which is probably unhealthy in and of itself. I've lost a lot of sleep, become less productive all around, BUT I've had a blast, so has my girlfriend (so I have now bought the game twice with all of the expansions) and have designed some pretty amazing cities. Definitely love that the game came out in 2015 but there is STILL updates within the community everyday, just adding to the entirety that is this game. Sim City on crack, and just as addicting as regular crack. Thank you for something to fill the void!"
22193,"Spent 200+ hours trying to build a converging diamond interchange on my PS4 and PC. And man, was it satisfying?"
22194,"Almost 100 hours on record. It's cool at first then city skylines turns into traffic manager. And it just drawing roads and coloring districts.

I know there are mods to handle this but ehh, its tedious to outline every intersection or roundabout to work as it should.

22197,"When I bought this game the next day I was late for work without sleep
10/10"
22198,"The best city builder there is, has everything you expect from a city builder."
22199,"I've tried this game a few times since 2016 and every time I'm left frustrated. This title tries to rein in the broad fan base by limiting your starting area to the size of a mid-west town and teasing you with future unlocks that are integral parts of the city and are yet unavailable for early planning.

In short the game is not fun, just frustrating that it's so demanding and restrictive and doesn't allow me to be creative. I like to place highways early and build out certain sections from there, letting my city grow organically from the areas that were best laid out while letting the others become integrated. This game just wants you to buy DLC's in the hopes the pretty colors will distract you and the overpopularity of this title shows that it works.

While I generally like Paradox games, this title walks hand in hand with Stellaris to offer a wide-yet-paper-thin playstyle that will pressure you to buy DLC's that offer new cosmetics but nothing solid while QOL improvements are ignored. It's sad that nothing positive has been made for the city planner gaming community since SC4."
22200,Best city builder on the market
22201,"Addictive!! I love the personalizing available in this game vs other city sim games I've played. I'd have more hours in it if I let myself play more often, but since I usually get sucked into playing for a whole day when I do open it up, I refrain from playing too often since I have work and stuff."
22202,"recommended to play, if you have an interest to resource management"
22203,It's pretty poppin
22204,"Its the quintessential city builder, nothing else in terms of city builders comes close. All of the user created content, the ease of modding, and the endless add-ons. I have been playing the base game for years and I never get tired of it."
22205,The game is overall good. This game is one of those games where mods play a role.
22206,"Hm, yes. Much the good game. Very the good. Many fun."
22207,"Very nice and addictive game that will keep you busy for hours. I would recommend buying the DLC aswell, these really add an extra dimension to the game."

22219,"Lol, it's fun."
22220,"Best city builder by far. From street building, transit, planning, zoning, mods, map editor. The possibilities are truly endless in this game and no city builder to this day has been able to surpass this masterpiece."
22221,very addictive
22222,"The game is pretty good. I like playing with the traffic flow and things. The things I don't like are:
- very few scenarios to play
- random things happen to the city or residents, and you have to search on google to find out why, and what to do about it.

Recommended? I guess, if you really like the city builder type games. Maybe I didn't learn enough about it to get to love it."

Oh sure, the residents complain ""there's nothing for me to sell"", ""this noise pollution is terrible"" and ""there has been a dead person rotting next door for the last 5 months"" but guess what: usually the solution is sorting out the traffic.

In short, 10/10, would recommend to anyone who likes to fiddle with details to make the big picture work as intended."

There are so many good things about this game that make it so enjoyable like how creative you can be since you have so many tools at hand to use. it is never a dull moment with this game as something can always be done. the money system works well and i think was balanced out good. There are some really great DLC's for this game that really give it more QOL. The only things i would like to see changed is having houses actually have a driveway so the people who live in the houses park their cars in the driveway and not on the side of the road. other than that there honestly is not much id change. If you ask me i would say to buy this game 100%"

22271,"EN
An interesting game, but if the creators don't fix the car's algorithm changing lanes, it will make you very angry. One of the pillars of the game's success is that its traffic of cars is fluid, otherwise it will have cascading problems (garbage, corpses, public services, stressed population, etc.). The cars, after a certain amount, they do not change lanes correctly before arriving at the intersection, then they form huge queues before the intersection, in addition to being quite frequent they are only in one lane, not advancing the size of the road / intersection. I lost all my patience with the game because of that. Unfortunately I didn't get the money back, as I played a few hours more than the maximum allowed to get a refund.

----------

PT-BR
Um jogo interessante, mas que se não consertar o algorítmo do carro trocar de faixas, fará você passar muita raiva. Um dos pilares do sucesso do jogo é o seu trafego de carros estar fluido, caso contrário, terá problemas em cascata (lixo, cadáveres, serviços públicos, população estressada, etc). Os carros, a partir de certa quantidade, eles não trocam de faixa corretamente antes de chegar na interseção, aí formam filas enormes antes da intereseção, além de ser bem frequênte eles ficarem só em uma faixa, não adiantando o tamanho da via/interseção. Perdi toda a minha paciência com o jogo por causa disso. Infelizmente não consegui o dinheiro de volta, pois joguei algumas horas a mais do que o máximo permitido para obter o reembolso.

22273,So great
22274,The best city builder game made to date. Some of the DLC's should have been free updates to improve base game and some of the DLC's are worth the money to buy for the added content and improved game play. Overall this is a must have for city builder fans.

22278,"City Skylines got everything I wanted and wished for in a city building game and made it real. It is clear that producers studied the fanbase insatisfaction to other builders and knew exactly what we wanted.

EDIT* Still enjoying the game, but now I own a few of the DLC expansions. I bought them for cheaper luckily because in my opinion $15 for parks and college campuses is a bit outragous. Are they fun elements? yes, but not $15 in fun. The worst in my opinion is the concert pack. It gave like 5 buildings and so far the little concerts going on are just kinda mediocre to me. If you can get them as keys for less or something I would recommend the DLC packs but not at full price."

Blue Ridge Mountains
Shenandoah River,
Life is old there
Older than the trees
Younger than the mountains
Blowin' like the breeze

Country roads, take me home
To the place I belong
West Virginia, mountain momma
Take me home, country roads

All my memories gathered 'round her
Miner's lady, stranger to blue water
Dark and dusty, painted on the sky
Misty taste of moonshine
Teardrops in my eye

Country roads, take me home
To the place I belong
West Virginia, mountain momma
Take me home, country roads

I hear her voice
In the mornin' hour she calls me
The radio reminds me of my home far away
And drivin' down the road I get a feelin'
That I should have been home yesterday, yesterday

Country roads, take me home
To the place I belong
West Virginia, mountain momma
Take me home, country roads

Country roads, take me home

Take me home, country roads

22315,"While the traffic is not fully realistic, the game has an allure that is hard to put into words. It is the best version of a city-building simulation I have played so far."
22316,"It's an incredibly modable game, only thing I generally don't like about the game is the mass amounts of DLC's that are almost neccesity. I have 400 hours of active playtime in this game and wouldn't trade a single moment."

22327,This is the most flexible city builder yet!
22328,My cims complained about traffic even after encouraging biking. Industries in decline. Air quality perpetually shit. River full of shit. Boris Johnson simulator.
22329,"great game, just like sim city was back in the day, but better!"
22330,I like it. It's fun. get the multiplayer mod. Why is there so much DLC though?

22344,its okay.
22345,".
"
22346,"its not only a city building game, its a traffic simulator and the DLC's are extortionate"
22347,"Fun for a while. I would play this every day of my life but unfortunately even a $5,000 gaming rig is not enough. If you want to build dense cities you need a minimum of 64GB DDR4, an RTX 3080, and a Ryzen 9 3900x. Good luck if you can afford to play this game."
22348,"Played the PS4 version, so if you've a particular antipathy for consoles, you may stop reading here.

Cities: Skylines is probably the best city builder on the market at the moment. The base game alone is a completely superior experience to modern city builders like SimCity 2013 and Cities XL; with the DLCs installed, it even eclipses the much-vaunted SimCity 4 (and I used to play that religiously). The level of detail in Skylines will keep any aspiring mayor happy, with everything from citizens to production chains simulated to an intimate degree. Everything feels like it has both niche and purpose: nothing feels arbitrary, forced or nonsensical. And it is oh-so-satisfying when the fruits of your hard work fall perfectly into place.

There are gripes with C:SL, though. First and foremost is the DLCs: they do expand the game, but there's a lot of them, and you'll need most if not all of them for a complete experience. This is a quirk with pretty much every Paradox game, and I only forgive the practice because a) I grew up in the day where expansion packs were the norm, and b) each offers enough content to be well worth the cost. The best bet is to wait for the collection bundle to be heavily discounted (at least 66%), then snap them all up at once.

The rest of my complaints are more about personal preferences. Of these, you [i]can[/i] expand your city's borders (which in and of itself makes C:SL ten times better than SC2013), but you're limited in the number of tiles you can buy - however, there're mods on the PC version that do away with those limits."
22349,"great game, addictive af."
22350,"An awesome game if you grew up playing sim city. It's just like it but better!
"
22351,"Quite nice to play. Building cities feels like a wonder, although it can get frustrating when ""oh we have this one problem and uh yeah"" and you don't know how to fix it. Other than that, it's just nice to play. I recommend."

22354,I still like SimCity but this games does many thinks better and is like more real city still would like a game witch is more like SimCity
22355,"Really fun game that's easy to sink dozens of hours into, though it's essentially more of a traffic planning simulator as your city grows. The only drawback of this game is that it's performance heavy (""you'll get 25-50fps and YOU'LL LIKE IT"", regardless of system specs), but this isn't really too big a deal as the gameplay is completely playable down to like 10-15fps. This is also one of the few games that actually thrives if you have more than 16GB of ram, especially with mods. It's probably not playable unless you have *at least* a modern 4-Core CPU, 8+GB of ram, and a decent-HDD."
22356,"I spent over 10 hours building this amazing city and really had the funds rolling in, so I decided to try making a hydroelectric plant. It turns out doing so can instantly flood and and destroy your entire city. Thanks for the warning, dev team!"

22368,"[h1]Hands Down the Best City Building Simulator[/h1]
If you like Sim City, you'll love Cities Skylines. Not just because it takes every aspect of City Simulators to the next level graphically and game play wise, but because of the massive player community that has contributed an almost limitless number of mods and assets for everyone to enjoy.

A few DLC are a must have, like [u]Mass Transit[/u] to reduce traffic headaches as well as [u]Industries[/u] to supplement your City Income. Plus they come with their own Scenario maps and add to the enjoyment of the game.

I also highly recommend:
[list]
[*][u]After Dark[/u] for day/night cycles and Leisure/Tourism businesses.
[*][u]Park Life[/u] for building your own Amusement Parks, Zoos, Camp Ground Parks, Sightseeing Tours and more.
[*][u]Snow Fall[/u] for anyone who loves winter. Also adds rain/fog to all maps and Tram lines.
[*][u]Natural Disasters[/u] because who doesn't enjoy building a city and then hurling meteors, lightning bolts, earthquakes, tsunamis and other destructive forces of nature down upon it.
[/list]
There is no other Sim like Cities Skylines."
22369,Best of the best game ever. I could learn anything from it
22370,"Does not start, apparently old issue they refuse to fix. Garbage - don't buy!"
22371,This game lets you create the utopian (or dystopian) city of your dreams. It also has so many details (from building glorious monuments to controlling traffic) that it makes the gaming experience even better.
22372,"Epidemic
"
22373,"What to say. I bought it almost 6 years ago when it was released. it was $22.99 back then (not even expensive). Never reviewed it. It was not needed, everyone was praising this game. I am just a casual player on this game, not that many hours in comparison with the psychos out there: In 2021 Cities Skylines is still one of the very best City Builder games ever created."
22374,great game!!!!
22375,"The maps are a bit small, but overall it´s a great game (especially with mods)."
22376,GG
22377,"I was never interested in computer games, but for some weird reason the Youtube recommendation algorithm suggested some Cities: Skylines videos. Remembering that I played the first edition of Simcity as a kid, I clicked on one of those. After watching many videos by Citywokcitywall, Biffa, Twodollarstwenty, and others, I finally decided to buy the game and try to play it on my laptop. It's a struggle (usually I'm around 5FPS or below), but I'm loving it thus far."
22378,"Spent a lot of time, enjoying it"
22379,Have you sleep yet ? Son !!!

22412,muy bien mycket bra ja
22413,"Started this game totally blind. First ever city builder. I was not disappointed. The audio was a little bit jarring, because it's all ambient noise. It does this thing where you hear the wind blowing, but when you zoom into your city you hear the bustle of it. As your city grows, the noise pollution is evident and I got used to it. I ended up liking it. Still a bit jarring to zoom out and hear only wind though. I've only played for three days because I had to focus on university, but this game was so addicting I had to quit cold turkey because I couldn't get my mind off of it."
22414,A lot of mod and DLC play a game with slow pace and slow life. Take your time!
22415,not shit
22416,very fun on PC however you need a lot of mods to actually enjoy the game and the game is more of a traffic sim more than a city one since the AI is pretty dumB

22422,good
22423,eh
22424,"This game is an amazing city builder game but unfourtunatly it crashes a lot but I think that may just be my computer as my games crash a lot sometimes.
But overall pretty fun game I love seeing all the people and buildings I love how you can see how the people are doing and everything! I love that you can the feture where you can re-name streets buildings and even people although I do find it pretty hard to get everyone educated like you place down 5 million schools and it's like ""Oh you have 2% educated and 98% non educated"" and than you wait an hour and than check back on it and it's like ""Oh now you have 3% educated and 97% non educated"" But it's still a very good game but it get's pretty hard to keep your city good once it gets big tho it's like, ""You have a abandond building destroy it"" and my question is is WHY DO YOU KEEP ABANDONING YOUR BUILDINGS!!! But it's fine it's not that hard to just delete a building it is very fun to make your city big and than to look around it and see all that you have made!!!👍🏼👍🏼👍🏼"

22431,Hours and hours and hours (and hours) of city-building fun. Don't forget to sleep.
22432,Coolest simulation game ever
22433,"very fun
"
22434,"Still to this day the only good modern town planner, if you ask me. TT clones don't count for this. Neither does Sim City 2/3/4.

Almost everything you might want in this game is either covered by the mostly must-have DLCs or the tenthousands of mods and assets.

This leaves me basically with the biggest issue that this game has: I wish there were seasonal changes. It's the only gripe I have.

Stunning and eye-opening for its time, these days, the mods make it what it is.

Vanilla is functional for a few hours, but you'll soon want around half of the DLCs, and 10+ gameplay mods - imho, the devs should pick up all the no-brainer ones (like traffic manager and such) and incorporate / bundle / pay the mod devs for their work - because honestly, I wouldn't want to play this game on console or vanilla anymore.

-

What I'd wish for the eventual successor to have:

-Seasons and seasonal events
-Several distinct international styles, maybe picked on a globe, which could also influence seasonal day-night cycle durations and how harsh or little the season changes are. (still with the option to have a 'china town' aka themed districts, but it'd be a lot more intuitive to go by globe, esp for the season / weather part)
-map-local weather - rain here, sunshine there, snow in the higher regions, fog elsewhere, etc.
-A rethinking of the disasters - they're way too devastating and punishing - I wouldn't mind them if they wouldn't mean I'd have to rebuild the overly detailed whole areas they ruin, desperately having to try to remember how they were and how they did function, or give it up and have to come to gripes with that I'll have to build anew over them. Long story short, I switched off disasters and I would not recommend spending money on that DLC in this game. Next game needs to do that better.
-As said above, just incorporate the top 20 of must-have mods of this one directly into the next game from the get-go.

-

I don't want yet another Transport Tycoon clone / reskin. Those games are great on their own accord, but here I want to build a city / region, and with all the DLC and like 50+ mods, this here is near perfect. Round that up to perfect, and it'd be the best game ever.

-

Oh and yeah, I upgraded my PC to an otherwise overbuilt monster for just this game. You might have to do that, too.

Basically, have at least 8 CPU cores, and as much RAM (16 GB is a min req if you ask me) and V-RAM as you can afford. Especially if you want a lot of asset mods."
22435,.
22436,"i liek to build squiggly roads and put buildings next to those roads, so this game was a real treat."
22437,"Not bad, things get complicated fast, kind of has a modding community."
22438,Best city builder ive ever played - 10/10
22439,Thank you so much Paradox! And Kudos to Colossal Order for releasing this game. I am proud of the support by the team and you all are very helpful. Though I feel upset seeing this that being a very good game the high intakes of the DLC's are very low and useless. But I can agree that Xbox Users don't get workshop content. But I am greatful for this and thank you ALL

22449,"This game is awesome. I'm pretty new to city builder games but I really enjoy it. It takes a lot of critical thinking and patience, but somehow it is really great for anxiety. I lose track of time when I play and before I know it, 3 hours have gone by. The mods and DLCs are great too. Definitely a must try for anyone with a lot of time on their hands."
22450,"it´s a good game, Played it for few hours.
It is a ""let me just finish this one thing before i quit"" kind of game"

▶ The Graphic is good.

22479,Cool game you can commit genocide 10/10
22480,Fun game that never seems to end. You can play with or without mods to your hearts content. I prefer running mods to add to realism and make my city look nice.
22481,confusing
22482,yes
22483,"I have 0 design talent, but still fun to just wing it."
22484,Simply the best city planning game out there right now. Very in-depth and very realistic. I highly recommend this game to anybody interested in the genre.

22486,this game > sim city

22488,"What I like:
+ Probably it's the only (modern) game that gives you a chance to build a metropoly
+ A great selection of mods / assets / tools that improve game experience a lot.
+ With custom assets you can build photo-realistic scenes / dioramas. Check on YT what people do.
+ Some mechanics in DLCs 
+ All those intersections, transport hubs etc. are fun to design and build

What I don't like:

- Game has a lot of paid DLCs that introduce mechanics / elements that should be already in a base game. 
- Although mechanics from DLCs are quite fun to play with (industries specialisation) they break balance. Need money? Build industrial zone and stop being poor.
- I said I like additional mechanics from DLCs but as I played more I got a feeling of lost potential and superficiality. Example: Fishing industry. I see that depending on depth and water current there are different fishes to catch and I can assign routes for specialized boats with intention of getting more efficiency and variety. Then I realized that at the end all tunas, salmons, anchovies gives one and the same product - canned fish. So it doesn't matter what you catch. Oil, ore industries? Different buildings but same pattern, just build everything and adjust proportions. Werehouses? Very basic tweaks and still unituitive for me - just build one for every product and set 'balanced'. Match Day DLC? Great idea to add some variety for monotonous traffic and test your public transport. Turns out very basic. Not much input from modders with assets for that DLC and you realize how important is their support. But at least this one is free.
- Sweet-candy graphics
- Tourism bug: when city ""attractivness"" level hits certain point, it gets reduced to zero. In result, you have sudden drop in tourism revenue and amount of tourists to literally FEW. If you have planned your city around it - it's gamebreaker. Also, all those transport-related buildings loose their point if you have planes / trains carrying 2 visitors each. A bug well-known for years, never fixed. Only solution is to switch off attractions to get below max allowed level. The worst thing I experienced within 100h. Too serious to ignore.
- Mods are adding tools that should be available in vanilla. Normal thing but there is too much of it. Official update breaks a modded game until modders fix it. Unmodded game makes no sense.
- That being said, devs should make the game more modding friendly - a proper mod / asset selector and ability to on/off/substitute everything, profiles for particular saves. Considering that DLCs are selling usefull stuff piece by piece, I would wish to switch off things I don't need as enabling all DLCs consumes precious RAM. And you want it as much as you can to get all that great stuff community has to offer.
- Economy / milestones / progression: game is good as a sandbox - just that. First you struggle to set up your city for the first time (or couple of times) - to not to go bankrupt. At certain point you just grow, grow, build new stuff - money is not an object, easy and repetetive. Here goes DLCs' mechanics: adding some variety. It's good game to sculpture your dream city but not really as a management / economy sim.

Summary: You want sanbox to build your dream swiss village or japanese city without all that money, demographical and economical nonsense? Have a sh*tload of RAM to support all those essential mods? It's a great game for you. You want some decent challenge? Might get disappointed. Transport Fever 2 looks like clone of CS but instead of being a mayor you are CEO of logistic company. Looks very similar yet has different centre of gravity. Here, you need to make your bus lines etc. economically viable. Makes a difference. Also interesting missions with historical background - really not bad. Having that in mind, it's difficult to ignore CS' deficiencies. There is a little competition in this genre but after all I heard I got disappointed. This should be rather mixed review, it's not a bad game. 7.0/10"
22489,Really fun. Teaches you econemy.
22490,Great game!
22491,I love this game! I had to change my review because i originally rote a bad review because the game glitched out quite a bit. so its a bit glitchy but otherwise its perfect.
22492,brill and addictive game

22505,Worth every penny.

22507,"Very good and detailed city game. Its a lot of fun and gives you a lot of interesting features in the basic game. I would however warn any buyer that it is misleading in what it gives you. Paradox games have high quality, but also high prices charging for DLCs, extensions which make the game far more fun. Although the vanilla is certainly playable, the best features cost extra money. Considering DLCs can cost half the cost of the game per DLC this can be quite pricey. It is fun, but it can be a time suck, so it really depends if you like games such as Sim City and management."
22508,"This game is a decent city builder, but what makes it so much better is the modding community, it wouldnt be the same with out it."
22509,mantap jiwa
22510,Everything you love about the classic sim city games with a great modern enhancement.
22511,awesome game!
22512,Free dlc tho
22513,yes great game
22514,"Simply the best city building game today. That's all you need to know.
"
22515,Amazing game hands down.
22516,"This game managed to make me forget that I bought Simcity 5

good mod support, oh and a great unmodded experience



okay maybe im still salty about simcity"
22517,"I mean...yeah, best city-builder on the market atm, even without mods. They took the crown from Sim City´s shambling corpse by right of combat. But that´s old news."
22518,el mejor juego para pasar el tiempo y sacarse el estrés de encima
22519,Good game if you like city building.
22520,epik
22521,best game
22522,I like the accessibility of this game. Straight forward but also lots of layers if you want to get into the nitty gritty.
22523,not bad
22524,"well the first few hours you have no idea what your'e doing and by the time you do start to have an idea your game will start crashing every 10 minutes. On a second whim i played it a little more and it stopped crashing, idk what is wrong with the game but it is pretty fun if you have the DLC's for it.
Edit: i guess the game just has a mind of its own..."
22525,"It's a great game, but the intelligence of the npcs and the traffic must be fixed."
22526,"my citizens get poisoned all the time
fun"
22527,"I'd love this game a lot more if the DLC didn't cost over $200 but hey, good time waster."
22528,very in depth
22529,"Tons of fun if you like creative games and making city look nice. No campaign, no story, the only challange comes from player poor planning, lots of creative fun."
22530,TIs good
22531,I cant understand a single fucking thing about how this game works and it does absolutely nothing to explain it
22532,"I Love this game, not only does it challenge you to learn and understand planning a city properly, the creativity side of it is endless also. Spent far too many hours where I should have being focusing on something else in the real world, sat here merrily ruining my own productivity to the advantage of my sims.  I would happily take a week off just to sit here on this game and employ a cleaner to take care of my own house."
22533,"I bought the base game for myself for Christmas a couple years ago - enjoyed it so much, I bought all the DLC within the week. My favorite weekend routine is to spend Saturday mornings growing cities while listening to music and drinking coffee. The modding community is great, and I find the YouTube playthroughs (Biffa, City Planner, etc) to be a pleasant cure for insomnia.

The game eats through system resources though, so I suggest adjusting the RAM priority in Windows Task Manager if you're having problems.

9/10 would flood my Pearl Bay map with six tsunamis in a row again."
22534,Is good.
22535,This game gave me a fetish for building intersections. I now identify as intersexual.
22536,doing some things to kind of fix the traffic but then it actually goes up to 90% will make you feel like you're a god (even though it took 6 hours)
22537,good
22538,"DLCs are a bit overpriced for what you get (you can easily make the game cost >£100 if you wanted them all), and some of them don't add very much - the latest Sunset expansion being particularly bad for it.

But overall it's an excellent city builder/sandbox game. There are some things that can be quite fiddly (eg bus routes) and a few frustrations which can lead to you accidentally crashing your city by deleting one power line etc, but overall they're survivable, if mildly annoying sometimes."
22539,Its my dream come true city builder game that was printed on the package of Sim City 2000 but not inside the box alltough i had lots of fun with it. Tons of mods make this perfect game even grater but also can break it. as always.
22540,"A company that can't make a game that forces you to run through the launcher, despite when running the games .exe file directly, and having that launcher install broken, and unable to launch is simply insane. Paradox is notorious for having issues with their launcher and it's not a hard piece of software to make.
I own most Paradox games, but a failure to be able to launch the game on a fresh install, is outright pathetic.

I've troubleshooted this issue before, multiple times and Stellaris had this same issue, until they overhauled the launcher and repaired the issues. Cities, clearly hasn't gotten that love.

Paradox: It doesn't matter how good your games are, (And they are amazing) if people can't launch them without jumping through a marathon of troubleshooting. No one will play or buy them."
22541,boffy made putting people though hell look more fun
22542,Highly immersive
22543,Warning: Guaranteed to result in time travel.
22544,ok
22545,"good one
"
22546,love this game.
22547,great game
22548,Most relaxing game of all time. Buy this game.
22549,i like the game
22550,If you have 15 dollors to get the disaster dlc its great.
22551,"Great game when you use the mods, the traffic mods are a lot of fun. BUT I like to build big cities and the game becomes very slow to the point it is no longer playable for me. I'm sure a big part of this is that my gaming laptop is just not powerful enough to handle the load but that doesn't change that it is not enjoyable for me anymore.

Great game, just make sure if you want a very large city that you have a very powerful computer."
22552,alibaba
22553,yup thats what im talking about
22554,"After several years of enthusiastically playing this game, the lack of vanilla implementation of severely needed features forcing me to rely on frequently incompatible and PITA-to-manage mods forces this to be a negative review.

Why should I need a mod to adjust the settings in this game? Why do I need a mod to be able to build realistically sized roads, or to adjust the placement of items? How does the developer put such a highlight on detailed creations, but then requiring the user to find, manage, and troubleshot conflicts with several mods to achieve such results?

This game isn't bad necessarily, but when you look at who's getting paid and what they're actually giving you, it's bad. All the greatest things about this game weren't made by the creators of this game."
22555,An excelent strategy game. The fact there are thousands of mods and a big community makes it even more interesting
22556,so relaxing. be sure to add mods and custom maps
22557,GOOD
22558,good
22559,its a fun game but it gets boring
22560,Very Fun if you are bored. rlly enjoy this game
22561,gud
22562,"I followed this game back in 2014 when it was in contention with Sim Cities (2013). Now, six years later, this game represents everything that the original Maxis game could have gone further, and even with DLCs upon DLCs there's still open ground for newcomers to start off with the vanilla build.

This is a perfect sandbox game for the cretin like me, who first discovered city building games since SimCity 2000."
22563,10/10 Great Game
22564,Capitalism
22565,"Just feels like a lazy port of the most recent sim city game they made, but a lot more anal, worse graphics and just less streamlined. Unfriendly tutorial and in-game design, don't like it one bit."
22566,"1. Build a road
2. Make houses by the road.
3. Make factories to make money.
4. Your people accidentaly drink sewage water,
5. Population decline
6. After 30 minutes resolving the problem you decide to flood the whole city,
7. Build a new city with a new industry and with a better sewage system.
8. Business is booming.
9. People are dumb.
10. You make them smart.
11. Now they are too smart.
12. After a hour of trying to resolve the problem you quit.
 10/10 game would reccomend."
22567,Great city sim with tons of custom content.
22568,"everyone keeps moving out and there's traffic jams everywhere

10/10 would ruin urban development again"
22569,"Very easy game to grasp, can keep you playing for hours."
22570,good
22571,Real zaaaaaa gas pack
22572,really good its addicting
22573,writing t his review so it stops tellilng me to rate it
22574,"苹果系统也能玩CL真是太好了！又重新下下来，入了两个新dlc开启沙漠地图，没有河流，只能抽地下水。这次没开无限金钱，于是第一很快就破产了……第二次，不能为了长远的规划把居民区和工业区隔得太远，玩到现在都没破产，已经三个城区啦。
每次最激动的就是拉低视角，从人的角度看看这座城市，或者坐上公交车慢慢悠逛，很幸福。
我评的这个好像本体，嗯，本体值得入！！！
其他dlc印象比较深刻的是有雪国供暖那个，雪景很美。
工业新入的，暂时不知道怎么和原始工业区分开，慢慢探索吧~"
22575,ITS POG NOT SUS
22576,Solid game all around. 10/10
22577,So much better than it was at release now that it has all these expansions.
22578,"I love the stupid comments some of the people make, the hashtags are great too!

#ilovetrams

But if you like relaxing games that can be challenging this is the game for you! I got it on PS4 first because of the monthly games before buying it on PC with the majority of DLC. Totally worth it!"
22579,Build house
22580,"""cities: skylines is a good game. buy it!"" -Donald J Biden-"
22581,its ok!
22582,fun game
22583,.
22584,"great game, worth getting the dlc"
22585,"Love this game, this game not for dumb people. U gotta be smart AF to play this game, build ur own city, control every single thing in your city, real life rules, real life requirements, be ur own city mayor haha, played more than 40hrs in 3 days still learning how to solve almost real city problems, no joking..."
22586,"I haven't properly played this game in a real long time but it's a really good city building game from what I remember. Can get quite challenging but there's plenty of options for things like urban transport, what to spend taxes on, how traffic flows will work, and stuff like that. Good spiritual successor to Simcity I'd say."
22587,"This is a very fun game. It's not as addictive as Civilization V, but it's just as entrancing while you're playing it. The music is decent, and the graphics aren't amazing but it's still really cool to see your own complicated city come to life, especially at night with all of the lights on."
22588,"Excellent game. Very well done, although if you want the best experience I would recommend all or most of the DLCs."
22589,yes
22590,8/10
22591,"Totally recommend that game. I'm an engineer and this game feels me like real city planner. However, with dlcies become very expensive but it's not paradox'es fault. It because of Turkey economy. As a final decesion, ıt feels very wonderful to create perfect cities."
22592,For all your cocaine-fused diorama fantasies without the hassle of dedicating your entire basement to it.
22593,k
22594,the brap
22595,is good
22596,I cannot believe how engrossing this game is. I'm not much of a gamer but I spent 25 hours over three days just messing around and enjoyed every minutes.
22597,"If you like city building and planning, this is definitely a game you can't miss. You will find yourself playing more than what it takes to finish an average game while not even finishing even building one city(like me)"
22598,Love the game.  So much to do.  There are some great quality of life mods on the Steam Workshop.  Check out BIFFA's collections.  Highly recommended.  This is what SimCity should have been.
22599,traffic control simulator
22600,Roundabout <3
22601,7/10
22602,"Cities is the best city-building game I've seen and played. Endless capabilities, incredible mods, lots and lots of tools for creating a realistic metropolis. Each and every city service is so elaborate that you must actually learn how to play first. The only thing the game is lacking for me, would be some kind of a tutorial."
22603,Steaming pile of DLC shite just like every other Paradox game. $20 to make a park is abhorrent. Fuck you.
22604,It's actually pretty good once you get used to it!
22605,funny game
22606,its a good game
22607,Good
22608,Better than Sim ciy
22609,"Remember Sim City? Well they put everything that WASNT in Sim City im Skylines, and made a great timeless game!"
22610,"I love it.  Depends on what you feel like doing
"
22611,CDN$ 200 dollar game. I would recommend if it was fairly priced.
22612,What sim city should have been
22613,havent stopped playing. love the challenge
22614,This game is an absolute masterpiece. No other way to put it. I played this game when I was growing up in middle school and a little into highschool. I am now majoring in civil engineering thanks to this game.
22615,iz good
22616,Very addicting game and the mod community has made it even better!
22617,This game is like someone took SimCity and sprinkled fun all over it.
22618,"build city
good fun"
22619,"Awesome Paradox game. Lots of DLC to catch up on though if you're new, which can be costly."
22620,goood
22621,i like the flexibility of the roads and the pleasing imagery
22622,Get it its good after a while
22623,goood gam
22624,"This is a great game, especially if you don't have time to play regularly.  It's very easy to pick back up where you left off."
22625,Best city sim ever!
22626,Its a great game with many options and it runs well on my gaming laptop.  Though make sure you have a good gaming laptop with pworerful grpahics and CPU before buying it.
22627,don't rush trying to get your cities up and running plain things out and take it slow
22628,"The options are endless, as well as the traffic problems! If you liked SimCity as a kid, this is the gae for you

22629,Me gusta que puedo tener control creativo.  el juego tiene infinitas posibilidades.
22630,"good game
a lot of dlc's
but hey
that's paradox interactive for ya"
22631,"I was jobless. I played this game, now I'm the city planner of my town."
22632,"Great to play around with.
Advice to have good pc though."
22633,lots of fun in my time ive played took a bit to understand things and im still learning alot.
22634,no
22635,Keeps you engaged!
22636,It's a good way to make your city and be any type of mayor.
22637,Bit buggy but very addictive
22638,I love this game. One of the biggest reasons for buying a gaming laptop was this game. Thought it gets repetative and nearly impossible to grow after 200k population but its fun. Love this and would continue playing this.
22639,traffic simulator with extra steps
22640,A great City Building Game!!
22641,Great game.. you will spend hours building.

22646,Sheeee
22647,"It has a degree of freedom that is just so fun, especially with mods like Road Anarchy and Demand-Master"
22648,"Very fun game, especially with mods from steam workshop!"
22649,a bit boring and hate the fact that you need to demolish buildings. overall nice if you want to create your ideal city. negative because it should be illegal to sell a product and after 1 million DLCs.
22650,zedrtyae
22651,It's Good
22652,Nice
22653,.
22654,I love this game
22655,amazing
22656,I made a lake out of raw sewege and forced the people to swim in it
22657,"Overall this game is good - much better than SimCity - but it still sucks that it's so ""American."" You can't build mixed-use developments or car-free areas (things that are normal everywhere else in the world), so every game becomes a car traffic simulator, and you end up watching Biffa videos. It's sad that a game developed in Europe won't let you make European cities without a tonne of mods."
22658,Honestly Im only here for rewards
22659,yes
22660,"Not sure how I feel about this game yet, maybe a few more hours of it will help."
22661,"A lot of fun.  Even without DLC, the core loop is engaging and the pretty is remarkable.  I strongly encourage the ""After Dark"" DLC, just for the ++pretty.

Only real complaint is that there are a few easy to fall-into death-spirals that the tutorial should warn about.  Instead of nagging about things we've already done a few times."
22662,cute
22663,สนุกมากๆๆๆ วันๆๆ ไม่ทำอะไร แก้แต่ปัญหารถติด
22664,fun
22665,"I'd gotten bored of sim city 4 and had heard good things about this game. I've tried to go back to sim city since playing cities, and quit within 10 to 15 minutes. So much more complex and interesting that anything sim city has offered."
22666,"Cities: Skylines is one of the best city building simulators around on Steam. It allows you to have complete freedom in building cities in your own unique and interesting ways. The management side of the game is also excellent. I would definitely recommend getting this game and the DLC's on sale. However, if you feel the DLC's are too expensive or you can't justify their price, sale or no sale, then the workshop assets that users have created are brilliant!"
22667,"For those who like this kind of game, do not hesitate, buy it. You gonna enjoy it a lot."
22668,A great city building game that that can easily be played 'out of the box' or modded for that extra control and creativity.
22669,this is good game!
22670,Really good game. We need to manage our city and complete requests of our citizens. this game improves people's creativity because you build a city manually
22671,"As someone who's never really played a city builder before, I thought I might be getting in over my head with this game. While the scope of it is truly massive even without DLC, I've never really felt lost. Most of the systems are very straightforward and intuitive, and it's immensely satisfying learning to go bigger and further and solve new and more complex problems. I can tell I'm going to sink a lot more time into this"
22672,Great game but every update they make is a DLC so if you ever want to see new stuff then you are going to have to pay.
22673,"Play it, or don't."
22674,yes
22675,"good simulation, which takes some time to understand and adapt to its mechanics, but once figured out, its pretty much fun to play and pretty addicting aswell."
22676,fun to play
22677,this game is fun but it's hard to make money
22678,Super great game!
22679,It is just awesome.
22680,"Game crashes upon load. Never even got to play it but it now says I've played for over an hour from just trying to get it to work, so now I can't get a refund. The customer service offers no solution for either the payment issues or the crashing issues."
22681,"This game is great, its not even hard to start off and doesnt take to long or to short to get to the next population objective. The best part is that the mods improve this game so much that it made me addicted to it. 

Oh yea comity is really bad and I wish I never waisted my time towards that game."
22682,Great game except for the fact that I have lost many hours to it.  Most of the expansions are great also just wait for them to go on sale.  The mods give this game endless customize-ability.
22683,"Very confusing or not in the tutorial or online on how to get certain things (certain unlocks, resources etc.) and has sooooo much dlc that is overpriced for the quantity. mostly city planner type gameplay instead of planning with new laws to pass that affects the economy of the people."
22684,good
22685,Just started playing and after an hour just gave up.  Not intuitive at all.  Feel like this was a huge waste of money.
22686,city planner
22687,This game is super addicting!!!
22688,An eight out of ten game. The game is easy enough to play.
22689,"It's a great game, but my citizens really ought to stop complaining all the time."
22690,Very fun game.
22691, game
22692,"This game have great concept but it's not optimized. It's like you have a shit professor, but he is a good person. 
"
22693,Keep in mind the base game is somewhat barren so look for some recommended mods to install. I still prefer SimCity though.

Step 2: Build a new city because you fucked up the economy
Step 3: Overexpand city

Step 7: Fire every natural disaster you possibly can at the city untill nothing is left, not even the terrain

BUT!!!! it’s also an ARCADE like when we were kids, so we can play awesome VIDEO GAMES, without dumb kids bothering us. speaking of which megan and i have finally decided to tie the knot- literally -we’re both getting snipped tomorrow at the hospital, that way we can save money to spent more on ourselves and our FURBABIES. i’m fuckin JACKED man, i’m gonna SLAM this craft beer and pop open another one!!!"
22702,Nice!
22703,Its good. Can be played at all skill levels as the game gets  more difficult as city size increases
22704,Very nice game very realistic.
22705,build city
22706,"I sadly cannot recommend this game anymore because of this really, really EXTREMLY bad performance.
The engine is outdated, the optimization is one of the worst I've ever seen!

My Rig:
3080ti 12GB OC
i7 11700k
64GB RAM 3200Mhz
ASUS ROG STRIX z590-E Gaming WLAN
(Game runs on my NVME SSD)

And even on this setup the game wont even run nearly at 60 fps in Mid-Game.
Even when I play without Mods a 30k populated city is only running between 30-40fps.
This is hilarious!

The early game, the planning, this makes so much fun for me, until I get these lags. These lags make me stop playing this game all the time.

Until it gets a redone or Cities Skylines 2 comes out, I can't recommend a game where only DLC are produced, but they refuse to keep the game up to date in performance. Sry Colossal Order!"
22707,Super enjoy. YES YES YES
22708,"This is one of those games wher you need to buy the DLC's in order to experience the content at max potential. This is a fun game but the evercoming DLC's ruin the experience, it feels like a free to play game. Except you paid 30$ for it."
22709,"Great sandbox city builder. Lots of assets and DLC, with more being added all the time. Fantastic support from the producer; Paradox Interactive, and the community."
22710,Extrem good game for chillin´
22711,good game
22712,A fantastic city building game where you can make your dream city come true.
22713,.
22714,Best city builder out there.
22715,"Great game, even better with mods (but you probably already knew that). Pricey with all the DLC, definitely worth is when a bundle and on sale."
22716,"Game is amazing, 10/10 reccomend. It allows you to bring out your creativity with no boundaries."
22717,Nice
22718,city
22719,By far the best City Builder out there.  10/10 would kill off my population by putting the water pump downstream of the sewage outlet pipe.  Protip - don't do that.
22720,"The best city building game I have played to date. Much better than anything EA could churn out. 

I have played since release but unfortunately my laptop at the time could hardly run this game. Now, I have a 4 year old PC and I can even still run this game at almost max settings so it is good for almost any PC to play. 50 hours in but if it has counted what I've watched as well the number would be in the hundreds.

If you are playing this game without the Paradox hell of DLC, make sure you get mods! Mods are some of the only ways to fix traffic which will almost always be a headache. Just recently I have been able to get DLC and the game is just so much better. Would definitely recommend the park DLC!

This game definitely deserves a 10/10 especially after I went and read some other reviews. The workshop content is amazing and if you look hard enough online, the DLC really isnt too expensive.

Can't wait to get back to my 16% traffic hellhole!"
22721,"Steep learning curve, but by far the best city builder out there."
22722,great game
22723,goodgame

22725,buildings
22726,yes build city watch city get big get mad at city when city no do what want city do restart make better city get mad make worse city get mad make city
22727,If you grew up play Simcity and want something more advanced
22728,ok game
22729,This game is awesome to occupy your time!
22730,Great Game
22731,I guess after nearly 500 hours spend I can say yeah it's cool go get it. Especially that it goes on 75% sale so often add to wishlist and snipe when sales go ahead. Definly got my money worth from this game
22732,Biiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiig cities. With skylines
22733,oihh yeaa
22734,"love this game. way superior to the other city builders out there. I keep coming back even after I get bored for a while. This game can take a lot of time  if you let it lol.

If youre not sure whether to buy it or not, put it on your wishlist and wait for the $7 sale they do a couple times per year"
22735,i always build traffic jams :(
22736,"Challenging and addictive. I couldn't figure out why my city kept dying all at once when my city started growing. I thought I just need more cemeteries and crematoriums, Now I realize pollution was killing everyone."
22737,good
22738,K
22739,obsesed with impractical power sources like wind and solar mods make it better
22740,cool game
22741,"I have bought all of the DLC for this game and its safe to say I'm still finding new things to add to my city. The base game is strong, even without any DLC there is still enough content to get started with. The mechanics all work well apart from traffic which I often find to be an absolute nightmare to manage. However, with DLC content there is so much, with different roads types, including public transport. Mapable industry the list goes on. I would definitely recommend this game to anyone as it provides so many hours of learning to construct a functional city and then struggling to keep traffic, and the cims under control."
22742,This city skyline game is very good because it can make me think about the layout of a city to run well
22743,Hours of fun and planning. Best city planner game as of now.
22744,Good for those who wanted to build a dream city hahaha
22745,Paradox's DLC policy is appalling
22746,"Good game. Game is good. 
"
22747,"Cities Skylines is a great city building game. It doesn't offer the same level of humour and storytelling that Sim City provides, but at the end of the day Sim City 2013 didn't work well once you achieved a certain level.
In addition, I think that Cities Skylines has been a more thoughtful development. For example, the options for power are more varied than SC (Dam, Water based Wind Turbine) which are available earlier in the game. I like the radius noise pollution indicator when you drop a building - it's true a Stadium would be a noisy place to live next to. I also like the Transport setup and gameplay - it's much easier than the likes of SC4 Rush Hour. Plus Cities Skylines allows your city to grow which wasn't available in SC 2013.
I have only purchased the base game but I can see myself checking out the extensions pretty soon. I recommend this game."
22748,almost heaven
22749,good
22750,it tastes better than most building games
22751,It's a great game!
22752, needs sex mod
22753,"Pretty simple game, I really needs offical scenarios and better options for education, and trash management"
22754,"This game is literally unmatched. i was introduced into city building games like most, through Simcity, which i still cannot believe i thought that game was good. everything from the general water/weather physics in CS is amazing and has me spending over 1550 hours on it."
22755,"I grew up playing SimCity 4 as my favorite city builder; however it was always based grids. The feature I absolutely love about Cities: Skylines is that you choose to draw roads along a grid or utterly gridless! I enjoy having this freedom in the game. Additionally, it is made by Paradox Interactive which is my all time favorite development company. Also if you are going to buy the game, I highly suggest getting some of the dlc as it is kind of necessary for certain city designs and to personalize your city. I particularly think that Park Life, Green Cities, Industries and Campus introduce the more interesting additions to the mechanics in the game. Otherwise, I think you could play the without the dlc, but a lot the more interesting things like building your own customizable park, university, your industrial park or having an entire city under on green energy and have electric cars. Other than that, Cities: Skylines is a pretty good city builder if you like having between grids or freeform roads; I highly recommend for a first city builder as it does give a set objectives to unlock more advanced buildings but then disable after your first city or so."
22756,very  good so good no packs needed 5/5
22757,"Can you add multiplayer mode
where i can challenge the other players with people number as an example
or a city with zero traffic and more...

"
22758,"Just a great city builder, you can really lose track of hours playing this. 10/10"
22759,"great game, very chilled, great community
"
22760,it is super boring
22761,"i have 27 ugandan childern in my basement 
"
22762,"good game

*except for the stupid death wave bug*

psa, if you notice a lot of people start dying very quickly you are probably encountering this bug. If your citizens start dying and your death services cannot recover the bodies quickly enough (this could be due to a lack of deathcare facilities but is more than likely a traffic issue) then citizens living near the dead body will eventually get sick, die, make more dead bodies, cycle repeats... eventually your entire city population will be down about 80%

Learned this the hard way. Save often ;)"
22763,"In combination with an amazing modding community, this is by far one of the best city builders on the market. If I didnt have to work, I would be playing this all day long."
22764,good
22765,Great fun and a time sink
22766,rally fun
22767,A very nice city builder. Wish RT would do more vids on it.
22768,"For some reason, this city builder just clicked with me much better than any versions of the other, more well known city builder game."
22769,Look it's a very good game but i just somehow got bored from it.
22770,"Great game, getting lost in it is pretty easy"
22771,Relatively fun game. So much can be done with just a little imagination.
22772,"TIME PASS
"
22773,still has some game-breaking bugs despite years of development
22774,is ok
22775,I like building cities from scratch. There are plenty of options.
22776,Good and good
22777,Cities: Skylines is currently the best city building game that is available!
22778,I like this game and the fact that i kind of installed 5000 mods / assets and i need to buy more ram because of it.
22779,Very good
22780,...
22781,r
22782,"I could play enough of this game to see that it is a marvel and would be very fun to play. However, check your hardware specifications before purchasing this game. The manufacturer's recommended system requirements may be impractically low. When I purchased by Inspiron 15 7000 Gaming Laptop, it was with the expectations that I would be able to reliably play any computer games that were contemporary with its manufacture. Cities: Skylines has been an exception.

By roughly the time I have filled the first the city's nine mega grids, it's clear that I am pushing me computer too hard. The fans and belts chug away, and I can almost hear Montgomery Scott shout from inside the processor, ""I've giv'n her all she's got captain, an' I canna give her no more!"" The loading times for the game slow to the level of a 1990's dial up modem, and eventually the bar completely freezes when I try to load my save. 

I still have Cities: Skylines installed on my desktop. It's a sad reminder of a game I wish I could play."
22783,Fantastic game!
22784,"I love it! Much more detailed than that 'other' SIM game.. Also tends to be better on resources for me. I really wish there were a multiplayer version, but that was never intended in the design so I understand. The DLC is awesome, and all of the workshop tools made for it make it even more fun!"
22785,very fun it is easy to get lost in time
22786,perfect game for aspiring urban designers
22787,this game is pretty good when your sad.
22788,Great game!!
22789,The best city builder I've ever played
22790,Great game. Must try
22791,"Best City building game you can find, and with DLC and endless mod/assets, some mods that are ""quality of life"" additions like Move it, Fine Road Anarchy, etc.. it is just a great game. gotta be careful not to download too much when looking at the workshop, because it is hard to not look without subscribing to a few.

I've played this game for a few years now, on my old non gaming laptop, no real issues, but I highly recommend a PC with 16GB or more of ram, Especially if you think you will play with mods. Since building my PC and playing this on higher settings and getting more asset mods then I could before, and smooth game play its much more enjoyable."
22792,You can make cities that don't turn into slums.
22793,"I'm only recommending city ckylines because i've seen what its like endgame. My first impression is not very good, as a begginer, it is incredebly complicated and theres no guide."

22801,game ok
22802,rất hay
22803,"Build road, solve traffic chaos, build more road, everything flooded, start new city, recommended!"
22804,"This Game equals hours and hours of fun, if your into designing, building, managing community growth involving every aspect.. this is a must have game."

22809,Great array of daily city activities to be realistic city planning
22810,beauty
22811,"Fun ""Relaxing game"", and by relaxing I mean that it can help distract you from an overwhelming life by giving you easy and simple problems to fix. It lets you feel like you have a better sense of control. I would suggest watching some people play on YouTube first to give you a good Idea of what to do when you first hop on. I recommend ""Biffa plays indie games"" or ""City Planner Plays""."
22812,JUST DID
22813,It's a pretty interesting game. Designing your own dream city is pretty fun.
22814,I love this game. I've played this as much as I've played Skyrim...
22815,"Such a fun game that scratches that inner city builder itch.. But having owned base DLC's on Origin store I was unsuccessful in transferring them over to my steam base copy game.. Over $100 of DLC, gone in cyber space. When I reached out to EA they were of no help, and when I reached out to Paradox - they told me since Steam didn't get their cut of the sale made to EA Origin for the DLC's I would be unable to transfer them over. I was told to ""wait for a sale"" . 

There's where I draw the line. REFUND. 

I will wait for Cities Skylines 2 - if there is one within the next 5 years. 

Everything about this game is great, but the one thing they are lacking that SimCity got it right is the multiplayer.. Yes, in SimCity, you used to be able to sell neighboring players cities your excess utilities.. You could also buy utilities from your neighbor if say you didn't want to build landfills and deal with all the polution that's involved. This essentially created an online economy, and it was addictive. 

CS completely lacks that. Tens of millions of dollars and 6 years later, there is still no multiplayer. However, every DLC you could probably think of that you would need and most you wouldn't need - are there. 

My advice is to wait for sale with this game. There are rumors that a CS 2 is in the works and will be announced soon. 

Lastly, shame on you paradox for not linking my Origin DLC's to my paradox account when I logged in to CS in 2019 and then telling me to ""wait for a sale"" just to rebuy them all over again. 

"
22816,hell yeah
22817,Easily the most addictive creator game I have played. Steam workshop assets and mods are alway1s giving me new ideas and ways to play.
22818,not boring
22819,By far the most detailed and best city builder I have personally ever played!
22820,"Between the DLCs and workshop content, there isn't a single thing you can't do with this city builder."
22821,"For those looking for a proper continuation of simulated city planning following Sim City 4, this is a perfect match."

22823,"I'm 45 years old, and spent some of my youth playing SimCity.  Being distressed about SimCity's online only gameplay and a poor release day several years ago, I lost it.  Time passed, found CS.  This game is one of those games where you learn slowly over time, and just every time you learn something you appreciate the game more.  Sometimes when I get stuck, I just stop playing for a few weeks, and then when I come back, I'm so full of energy and plans.  Just a really cool city building game; after you have mastered the skillset needed to succeed, one can build just the most amazingly beautiful environments/cities.  This game is a real treat for this old guy."
22824,I swear to go if I could commit hate crimes against drivers in this game I would
22825,very relaxing and SUPER SATISFYING
22826,"Its a fantastic game you will come back to over and over. Easy to learn but you will never master it. And the mods you can get to this game is over ant limit you can imagine.

22827,Fun

22835,Greatest city builder to date.
22836,"Bigger the city, lower the frame rate. No matter the hardware.
Still my favourite game."
22837,"I think its better than Simcity, more depth, better assets and a whole mod community"

22839,"Cities Skylines presents a dystopian future where city planners have to satisfy every need of their citizens to make their lives as best as possible or risk them moving to a better city.
An interesting contrast from reality, where citizens are stuck paying absurd taxes and putting up with horrible layouts with no regard for their happiness."

22848, ht5eddddddddd vb
22849,great game lots of different mods which i lke
22850,"hey a good game but with the DLCs it meh
"
22851,"I've tried games like this in the past but never really got into them. A game like this can be very intimidating at first when you don't really know what you're doing, but once you get it down, it's so much fun. I can lose hours playing this game. It's really fantastic."
22852,"This is an absolutely great game!
The base game itself is already amazing and gives you many options to get creative, however if you add things from (most of) the DLC's and the steam workshop you can literally build anything you want, they really enhance your gameplay. Cities can be micromanaged in so many ways, it never gets boring. 
I would 100% recommend this game to anyone who is interested."
22853,good
22854,"It crashes, it kills your RAM, it hates you for modding. But it's awesome.

I found it really valuable to check out the youtubers views on Mods to NOT have and to have to boost performance. Will totally change the way you play the game."
22855,Is such an awesome game and is much better in terms of space to build than simcity
22856,"I really like this game, it's pretty realistic however I would recommend that you download stuff from the workshop as some of items built into the game and DLC's are a bit boring. But besides that I would defo buy it!"
22857,Super binge worthy
22858,Game is interesting. Very appealing to city planning and transport enthusiasts. Much more functionality could've been provided by the game but mods are making up for that.
22859,"good game 
"
22860,EA could learn a huge lesson from this game
22861,"I don't remember how much I paid for this game. It might have been 80% off or more. But anyways, even if I had gotten it for free it would have been too much of a price. 
For a game that forces a launcher and a whole bunch of EULAs which state that they will harvest your information, even ""free"" is a too high of a price. No thanks, I'll just uninstall this ransomware crap. 
For a publisher that does this kind of thing, I got one thing to say: congrats! From now on I'll pirate every one of your games that I'd like to play. Maybe this won't change anything for you, but it will for me. 
I'm not giving my money to some fucking gypsies."
22862,This game is shit.
22863,"I started playing this game soon after it launched, because I had played SImCity before and thought this looked interesting, and have been hooked ever since. Ever since I started playing in high school, I am now in college studying urban planning, and for that I can thank City Skylines <3"
22864,ta bien chido lo vale cada centavo

22891,Its fun
22892,"Yeah as good as it gets. City building the way it should be but,unfortunately it lacks a bit of soul. Feels a bit too good to be true and doesn't really give you 100%+ that we really want in the full immersion category. 

So close though and compared to any other city building game it completely kills it on every front. Hands down the best city builder on every level. Makes a company like EA (Sim Cities master slave that is currently worth 41 Billion (and yes that is EA's market cap go check it out on some finance site) look like it should be peddling ping pong paddles in the city street next to an all night billiards hall at midnight during a hurricane. The King has awoken and it is Cities: Skylines.... Shall many further things continue and await us our benevolent designers of this wonderful game that didn't listen or pay attention to limits.  

614 Hours later it aught to tell you something right!"

22905,"I can't help but feel a little touched when I look out over my city at night. Thinking to myself, I made this beutiful thing that's glowing in the dark. I like to follow cims home from the airport across the city as they travel. I follow them on their way home and I see these small paradises along the way and think; that place, if I could live there, that would be awesome, but then again traffic in the morning would probably sour that happiness within a week... And that damned bus that's never on time, which in turn means that I always miss the metro by 2.3 days! And now someone built an Opera House next door and the walls are shaking whenever that fat lady sings, I think I need to go to the doctor because my ears keep ringing. The medical bill is probably gonna take my pension away, so I'll die way to early and my corpse is gonna rot in this apartment becuase the god damn hearse can't even get here to pick up my neighbor who's been dead for two months. That's it! I'm mad as hell and I'm not gonna take it anymore!

Great game! Play this sh*t!"
22906,"This is a masterpiece city builder, The best way I can describe it is Sim City 4 but with a modern engine! 
I would also highly recommend hitting up the Workshop for this game as there are tons of amazing content and feature mods that add so much more to an already content packed game!"
22907,not for me
22908,yes
22909,good
22910,"I have SimCity4 Complete Collection, City Life and SimCity Societies. Absolutely love Cities: Skylines! I had played it enough to unlock most of it then my HD died, backup drive was being iffy don't even know if I had backed up the last time I played. Was very disappointed when I reinstalled it that buildings/monuments weren't still unlocked. So this time around, I saved the file to the cloud which I very rarely use. Have all the accomplishments I can get except 1000 nights. So now I feel free to download some mods and really make this wonderful game sing.
Fantastic city builder! Can't afford all the DLC. Maybe I'll catch it sometime on a great sale I can't pass up. If builder games are your thing, you will love this one."
22911,"The game has only started crashing after 50 hours of playing, and I haven't been able to find any help whatsoever. Lovely game but it is terribly optimized."
22912,goodbye to my life
22913,yes
22914,very good
22915,"good game

"
22916,Super Game with great graphics and gameplay. Without DLC's still fun and not repetetive after 40+Hrs. The best city builder game on a Steam! Highly recommend this game.
22917,very easy to get lost in creating your beautiful world
22918,"This game saved my life.

I am 76.

My ex-wife and I have a daughter together, and adopted our son together. They are now both 4 years old.

When we were going through our separation, I found myself lost and miserable. I was self destructive. I got so mad one day from everything spiraling out of my control that I punched some concrete in a moment of overwhelming emotion. That caused me to break my 5th metacarpal in my right hand... my working hand... my games hand... the hand that I held and carried my children to bed with... The hand I desperately needed to make sure I could continue to provide.

After learning of the severity of my self-inflicted damage, I was borderline suicidal. Keep in mind that just a few months before this, I was the happiest man with no history of depression or anxiety. I have never had fits of rage, or been one to break down and cry, but I was in a low spot that just really buried me from being able to see the light on the other side.

Having nothing better to do, I searched for a game I could play, ONE HANDED while I recovered. I somehow stumbled upon this game and read some of the reviews. I decided that it had to be worth a shot... I must admit, I didn't beat the game, or play nearly as long as some of you. In fact, I may have only played this game a day or two.. With that being said, after doing so, I had a new found joy and hope for life. I was able to put behind me the pain and suffering that had been cast over me. I was able to see the fruits of my ""labor"". I relaxed for 5 minutes to this game, long enough to realize that I was going to be okay.

After coming to that realization, I turned the game off, and I went back to work. It hurt my hand like hell but I was motivated. I stopped feeling so damn sorry for myself, and I became the father I needed to be in that moment, not the weak boy I was behaving as."
22919,"Great game, Some doubts about how it really reflects on the real world. but we have the Steam-workshop for that."
22920,"Much better than Simcity but it misses a few things
1) No option to upgrade buildings. If my Police station is running out of jail cells you cannot add another jail cell instead you have to add another Police station.
2) No Community College in the base game. Instead there is only University which is very costly.
3) Although the city feels alive, the residents feel dead / robotic.
4) UI is very cluttered compared to SimCity.

I will add more points in the future, about the things which I am missing in Cities Skylines. However it is still miles ahead of Simcity. From traffic management to making laws, it is much more intuitive."
22921,Yes
22922,much good
22923,"Managed to create hell and kill off my entire population with sewage pipes.
10/10 would play again"
22924,"Completely immersive, massive DLC community, top-notch creators content on YouTube...really outstanding."
22925,good
22926,yes
22927,"the only way i can enjoy this game anymore is with an ungodly amount of mods that tank my pc
personally i wish the game catered more towards realism 
was enjoyable for a while though"
22928,"Cities Skylines, A great game about making city's and having a good time. If you like games that are calm and chill this is perfect"
22929,A must play for fans of city building simulations. I have played every Sim City and other simulations but this one is over the top.
22930,"For those who love creativity, design and millimetric perfection, with the right mods this is damn near a perfect a game. 
This is an OCD game and works best when you place each item by hand for the ultimate control."
22931,Awesome game!!! We need a Town hall and a City hall: a town hall when a certain population level is reached and then an upgrade to a City hall once another population level is reached. Maybe a Town/City public works facility and a Town/City equipment facility for owned vehicles and supplies.
22932,"If you like to build and/or city plan, then this is definitely the game for you. :)"
22933,Great game.
22934,Fun good looking city building game
22935,"Nice
"
22936,fun
22937,i enjoy to playing this game...
22938,Hello
22939,Fun game to waist hours at a time playing.
22940,"Very fun game. Love it! There is a lot of depth to the game. I was a very big fan of the SimCity series, and Cities Skylines takes it a step further. A lot of customization and hours new, fun material. I highly recommend for any simulation or city builder fan."
22941,"I've lost relationships, but I've build cities"
22942,i love it it is my style of game
22943,VERY ADDICTIVE :)))
22944,"If you loved any of the older city builders such as Sim City 2000 or Sim City 4, you will absolutely adore this game. Colossal Order did something that EA could not; recreate the joy of it's ancestors. With a well-designed base-game and amazing mod-support (including workshop) that allows you to add functionality, depth and visual design to your city at will. Hell, you can even design your own buildings and assets with the Asset Creator.

However, it is not without it's flaws. The main downside to playing this game is how... ""empty"" the base game is. Granted, for only $20, the game is more than worth it's price; but in order to have access to a lot of the more in-depth (IMO more fun) aspects of the game, you have to shell out a good bit to get access the main DLC. However, they are well worth it if you find yourself enjoying the vanilla experience. Which leads onto my next talking-point: Mods.

Mods are absolutely a godsend for this game. The unmodded experience has a lot of little peeves you'll find that can make the game feel restricted and/or rather annoying to play. Sometimes snapping curved roads to each other can be troublesome, or you accessing city info is a little tedious to do, or perhaps you don't want to have to manually destroy abandoned buildings. And they're all super easy to install since it all goes through the workshop. Subscribe to what you want, enable it in-game with the Content Manager and you're all set. 

My all time recommended mods would be TM:PE (which you can better control traffic issues), Move It! (move things however you want), and Loading Screen Mod (which improves load times and helps find errors in mods). I recommend watching videos or reading some ""Best Mod"" articles to find out some very helpful mods to create a better experience for you.

Gameplay is a lot like many city builders so I won't elaborate too much. You start out in a empty city with nothing more than a connection to a highway. You'll start building the framework of your city with roads, securing a water source and creating electricity. Once that has been established, you'll zone for citizens, shops and industrial areas to bring people in. As you begin growing, you start unlocking new city services and expand upon existing services. The main goal is to make a city that people want to join and expand while keeping them happy while they're here.

Graphics is not the greatest by far, but you can find mods that can enhance color and lighting that can make the game look gorgeous despite the limitations of the engine, Assets can also go far into creating a stylized look for your city. Once again, I would recommend watching some videos to find some that'll cater to you.

Overall, if you loved any of the Sim City and/or City Building games, I would HIGHLY recommend this game as it is the epitome of city building games at the moment. Give it a try with the vanilla game (only $20) and I doubt you'll be disappointed. 

"
22945,Amazing game full of fun. :)
22946,.
22947,"yes.
"
22948,Best City Builder Ever
22949,"This game is great for a relaxing sims scenario and structured planning game. It can be super challenging, but at the same time it can be really chilled."
22950,Honestly one of the best city planning simulators I have played. Endless replayability especially if you get the new content and try to adjust tactics to the new dynamics. Incredibly addictive so be warned.
22951,"Do you like city design? Do you like improving infrastructure? Do you want to design the city of your dreams? Do you want to torment your citizens with a giant poop volcano? 

Well... While I cant advise on that last option, you can do all of those things here. Cities Skylines is an amazing city builder, carrying on and improving upon the ""original"" city builder (Sim City), Cities Skylines is the go to game for your modern city building management sim. With actual ""game changing"" DLC and an awesome community providing Mods and custom Assets. If that sounds like your cup of tea (or coffee) then you will most definitely LOVE this game. 

That being said just as a ""beware"" for new players; unless you have lots of $$$, don't buy all the DLC at once, sales and bundles are a very common occurrence for this game, and I'd hate to see you spend more than needed. Also if you want to run lots of mods and custom assets make sure you have a computer that can actually handle it, otherwise you would have to do what I did and spend more money upgrading your rig *Painful chuckle*.

All in all 9 out of 10."
22952,Fantastic Game!!
22953,it is fun
22954,"It's super addicting to just build a huge city and see your money and population go up. Having to manage and build up the city takes a lot of time and it's satisfying to see it all. Like any paradox game there are 5000 overpriced dlc, however the base game is great by itself.

Graphics - 4 - Pretty realistic and good enough for a city management game

Gameplay - 4.5 - The game is simple to learn at first, but has a lot of complexity to it. Things like road hierarchy and simply making a functioning city will let you have tons of content to explore. Along with different maps the game has and a workshop, you can play many hours of this game and be fine with it.

Enjoyment - 5 - Obviously I enjoy the game a great deal as it is one of my top played games on steam as of right now. Recommend it very much.

Total Score: 13.5/15"
22955,Best City Builder on the market no questions.
22956,game is good but dlc expensive
22957,This is a great game so far...
22958,"Gra naprawdę jest bardzo dobra jeśli lubicie city buildery, napewno lepsze niż to nieszczęsne SimCity(2013). Do tego wsparcie steam workshopa powoduje że jak coś chcesz dodac to poprostu subskrybujesz i masz a jak nie ma co chcesz to jest bardzo prosty edytor obiektów i map. Podsumowywując polecam gdyż na rynku gier narazie nie ma lepszej (i narazie nie zapowiada się aby się pojawiła) gry tego typu."
22959,"iz gud game, I like"
22960,no
22961,"Superb level of detail.  Snowfall pack is a bit disappointing, as it's permanent."
22962,"Cities: Skylines is one of those games where you can just relax.  I play a lot of FPS games so sometimes just chilling out on skylines is sick af.  There are very few bugs if any, few things i dislike about this game are DLC is very important to this game, the DLC adds so much more content then base.  Base game is playable just lacks a large variety of things to do, the base game is rather just build city roads, zone the R.C.I areas and make money. The DLCs are kinda expensive for the content given but they add a lot to the game.  I do recommend the game but I highly recommend waiting for a sale so you can get DLC with the game and get more content."
22963,"its a very funny game, if you likes that kind of game, this is one of the best to play"
22964,big cock dog good game
22965,nice game
22966,is game yes :)
22967,"This is my favorite City Sim I've ever played. It's fairly complex and intricate, and a very fun challenge. The biggest downside is traffic is a nightmare without downloading mods to help manage it. Fortunately, this game has amazing mod support, so it isn't too hard."
22968,great city paint simulator :)
22969,It's cool.
22970,buidling
22971,yes city go brrrr
22972,its good. now worship meh!
22973,"It's fun, there are so many options, it's relaxing and i like it."
22974,Fun for many hours! Add mods to spice up the game if you can't afford the DLC.
22975,Yes
22976,"good
"
22977,"Really awesome game. I enjoy the progression that comes throughout the game, and the new abilities and such it provides. The details that the game lets you customize really adds to the immersion of the city building. 10/10 recommend!"
22978,"I've been playing this game for quite a long time now, I would 100% Recommend this game. It has a bunch of cool DLC's to go along with it."
22979,It has a learning curve at first but it is a fun game. I've played the Simcity games from the outset but SC4 crashes sometimes and the 2013 is too small with the tiles. This is a good game with lots of possible outcomes and I've enjoyed it quite a bit.  It is now my #1 for games.
22980,Is a good ole gamey game but a little boring if you're looking for a Sim City experience
22981,Good game for creativity
22982,"The last city builder I enjoyed was way back when I played SimCity 2000, so.. it has been a while. When I picked up C:S, after playing a bit, stopping for a while and coming back, I'm thoroughly hooked and wasn't able to stop myself from getting basically all of the DLCs and Content Creator packs, too. 15/10 recommended"
22983,poop volcano
22984,Good
22985,"Great city builder game.  I had the game for about 5 years before I gave it a try and I regret not playing it sooner. Cities Skylines have a lot to offer to keep the player busy.

It eases the player into the experience by starting with only the basics available.  

As the city grows more features unlock to add complexity.  At first it will look simple to just build roads and zones to expand, but later you have to deal with all the traffic caused by the bad road design choices you made.  Since every thing is dependent on transportation in the city the whole city will shut down if it's locked up with traffic jams.  So, traffic management is a big part of the gameplay.  Solutions like building public transport will keep people from driving themselves, thereby clearing up the roads.  The fun part is solving the problems you created for yourself with various tools provided such as better roads, public transport, pedestrian paths and bridges, smarter zoning (to keep industrial trucks from driving right through town).  

The road construction system offers a lot of freedom to build them in any way that makes sense.  Not restricted to a grid like some older city builders. 

The game also looks great.  It's a lot of fun just watching the traffic zooming around the network of roads.

TLDR:  Great game that eases the player into it and gets more complex gradually.  The fun part is solving problems the player created for themselves  to keep the traffic flowing.  Cities looks really good if the player is creative."
22986,i have adus
22987,"duh
"
22988,good:)
22989,Fun fun fun fun! oh wait.. I broke the game again but still FUN!
22990,many enjoyable hours
22991,it good
22992,
22993,"Great game, best to catch the sales. Summer, Christmas, Easter, etc."
22994,makin big cities i like the houses and industry #down with traffic
22995,gud game
22996,I flooded my city with poop and killed everyone.
22997,this is good game where you make the cities and such
22998,City planner but on nutshell
22999,i love this game. period
23000,buy the disaster dlc and kill ur citizens lol
23001,it good
23002,Love this city sim. Literally hundreds of hours of enjoyment building up your city and managing your cims.
23003,Great city building sim with lots of DLCs and modes =)
23004,"I don't play this game all the time, and I'm not good at it whatsoever. But for some reason, I always come back. The replayability of it is insane. It might not be my favorite game of all time, but it's damn good and it will not disappoint."
23005,Greatest way to waste time ever!
23006,Cool
23007,"It is a good game, but with out any dlc`s it`s not worth it."
23008,Very expensive.
23009,"This game is cool

Its fun, thus its pretty good
if you buy the game with all the dlcs the game will be at its best
Buy this game with dlc"
23010,Build a city. Aaand another City. And another one.
23011,great game
23012,fun for hours
23013,best city builder hands down
23014,"City Skylines is an absolute favorite way to spend a few hours. A vast community, tons of items in the workshop. No two games ever need to be the same. The mod support is stellar, if you can think it, you can build it. A city builder above all the rest."
23015,"City Skylines is honestly, one of the most complex and interesting city building games I have ever played. I am constantly finding myself immersed in traffic, trying to figure out the complexity to how it all comes together. Dare I say, I think it made me start to think differently as I began to piece together the reason why my traffic was so bad. I had no idea that each road had a purpose, or that depending on where you place certain utilities, it can be bad, even if there isn't a direct negative effect like when you place a dump next to downtown. Instead, the price you pay is not in money or bad opinions, but simply just bad traffic. I know over the years I've seen the complaints about how the traffic management is bad, and people don't like it, but honestly, you'll likely never find a city building game as complex at this one. I've got most of the expansions, and every time I dive into it I get lost in designing and trying to figure out where things should go and how people can get there. You lose time by playing, but honestly it's one of the best experiences I've ever had with a game like this."
23016,"Never get tired of th
is game, I always come back to it !"
23017,
23018,"Cool game
"
23019,No tutorial at all. This is definetely NOT FOR BEGINNERS.
23020,great game
23021,"Cities: Skylines is the best city building game I have ever played, even if I do have a rough time getting into it... and I suck at it. Tons of content, tons to do, tons of customization, lots of little micromanaging aspects, and full workshop support make for an outstanding game."
23022,"the best city builder ive ever played i feel sorry about sim city 
"
23023,best
23024,Endless hours of fun
23025,best city-building game. i recommend the industries dlc.
23026,It's as good as it looks and is fun to play
23027,"Great game, one of the best, if you like the sim city type games."
23028,The game is awesome for a nice relaxing experience. I do highly recommend getting mods for this game for quality of life changes for the traffic ai/road management because it has a tendency of becoming gridlocked very easily.
23029,"Good game, lots of intresting workshop content, weeks or months worth of fun, AMAZING mods!"
23030,"Thanks mom, you've give this game. i love it so much, i promise i will be a good boy"
23031,Very fun simulator with complex mechanics and a lot to offer
23032,game is very creative and lets you use your imagination to the max
23033,city
23034,"If you love simulation games, this is the game to get. 1000000000x better than SimCity and everything you wanted in SimCity is in this game"
23035,nice game
23036,its good af
23037,7
23038,"I liked the game when it came out, because I could ACTUALLY play it. But reinstalling it today to be met with error after error on launch, along with having to install a third party launcher (Which ALSO didn't work or register i bought the game) I felt the urge to play the game fade away. 

Game = Good
Jumping through hoops to play a game I paid for = Bad"
23039,"i love this game, the dlcs are awsome, I havent got them all but love the game."
23040,best game ever
23041,This game is very fun and interesting! It can take some time to get used to it but it has a lot of possibilities.
23042,"Best City builder game, 6 Years and still going strong.

 Great community for getting mods, ideas and tips on building a city. Awesome game with the ability to customise pretty much everything in your city. The Downloadable context is also good for giving you city that special touch. Love how you can create your own buildings.

 I highly recommend this game for those people that love to create a living city and manage it!"
23043,buggggsssss
23044,When I'm bored I randomly follow one citizen until my existential crisis hits me and I started questioning if life was just a simulation :(
23045,"way too fun for someone like me, I have spent so much time on this game and will continue to play long after the universe has imploded... seriously tho I love this game and highly recommend it"
23046,Its a lot of fun!
23047,Great game!
23048,"Its is the City builder game, tons of free, and paid content, your going to want the paid content so be ready to shell out some $$$ for this.  The simulation runs down to individual vehicles and single people.  The game is tricky enough to make it very hard, but you can play in sandbox mode where like the federal government, you just print money as you need it  (This does not work in the long run in real life people will get grumpy when a gallon of milk is $200), but it works in game."
23049,good
23050,"yes very nice they no like tax tho 
"
23051,"If you enjoy playing Sims City 4, then you would love this."
23052,"This game used to be really good. but lately I cant even load a vanilla editor with 40GB of ram and an 8 core xeon processor, This game has become basically unplayable and I am seriusly disappointed. I want to play a game and not debug every second step for hours before even launching the game."
23053,เล่นเลย ดูดเวลาชีวิตดี สนุกมากกกกกกกกกกกกกกกกกกกกกก
23054,get it!
23055,"I hardly get time for this game, because it's not a game you simply play for 1-2hrs. Some advice - go onto the Cities Skylines page on Reddit. If those videos / images turn you on, then this is the game for you. If you walk around your city and think about replicating it in a game, then this is the game for you. I stopped playing it for a while simply because of all the time that goes into it, but when I do play, it's the most fun I've had with a city-builder game."
23056,Very nice consuming and really enjoyable.
23057,"pp
"
23058,"The only City Builder game worth buying at the moment. It has plenty of workshop stuff and tons of DLC. Unfortunately the engine is a slow, hot mess. Make sure that you exceed the Recommended Specs."
23059,game. good
23060,89 Hours
23061,good game
23062,This feels like a true spiritual successor to SimCity. Beautiful!
23063,"Very fun city builder game where you can make the city you dream of. With such a strong mod community and the base game the sky is the limit. You can really do anything you want with custom buildings, maps, and mods to implement anything you want into the base game. The base game overall can kind of it get hollow after a while however. The base game allows you to implement services (police, fire, health, etc), road networks, industry, housing, commercial, parks, terrain manipulation, etc. After a while I did get bored and get a DLC and downloaded some mods and it sparked new life into the game. Now I can make atlantis by flooding a city with a tsunami and make a new on with a island I can create with the terrain tool. Overall I recommend this game a lot."
23064,"I own this game both on pc and switch because I like it so much. Basically, if you like city planning games, you'll like this."
23065,"Do you enjoy having no social life? Do you have a desire to never be seen again by your family? If you answered yes to at least one of those two questions, then this is the perfect game for you. 
***Warning***
This game has now been added to the top five most addictive substances for human beings. It has taken the number two spot, and only heroin has the potential to ruin more lives than this game does."
23066,Amazing game love it!!!!
23067,Good game.
23068,after 43 hrs playing i can say  best city builder game ever ..
23069,"Good Game, After 30 Goes  Finally building a town, city that makes a profit....."
23070,Will Wright would be proud.   One of the best Sim-Toys out there.

23074,Great fun game!
23075,"I mean I loved Sim City (scratches arm) and this game (scratches arm) is pretty great (scratches arm), and for sure it has not affected my marriage one bit (scratches arm). We are still in love and will be forever (scratches arm), though I haven't seen her in a few days (scratches arm), everything is good (scratches arm.)"
23076,Probably a good thing that I'm not a real city architect.

23084,Great and easy-to-use features. You can make any sort of city.
23085,"its good game it can give you relaxation .

"
23086,oui
23087,vouch
23088,So I got this game since it came out it is something that if your not into city building games you'd get board but if you get some DLC it does add to what you can do and build. I would say base game is good for like 20hrs of gameplay before it gets repetative I do highly recommend mods and assets that improve the gameplay so you can have diffrent buildings and road types as well as crosswalk lines the little things like that. So the idea isn't for big city but small and supper detailed. If your into that then this game is for you.
23089,
23090,fun
23091,It's a really relaxing game that you can play whenever you want
23092,the game would be too little playable contents if you are not buying any DLC. it would be a much higher rated game otherwise.
23093,"Goodbye weekends and hours of your life! You can spend days playing this game. I Love it, and now more than ever, in a sick sad world, it is nice to escape reality and build your own perfect paradise."
23094,its dope
23095,Fun game that really changeless you at times.
23096,"A game allows me to come into contact with constructing a socialist society via Industries DLC, not to mention the quest for dictatorship and totalitarianism. Possessing a great sense of power and authority without suffering internal party struggle, I sincerely suggest that all future commies should grab a copy and DLCs."
23097,its fun to play
23098,yes
23099,This game is a must have for those who miss sim city and roller coaster tycon and enjoy making sims lives pretty happy lol or bad if you like taxing the everliving poop out of them. lmao
23100,If you want to be your own mini city planner god - this game is for you. Absolutely brillant.
23101,fun
23102,Honestly the best city building game ive ever played.
23103,my cities always end up going bankrupt 5/5
23104,GREAT GAME
23105,Awesome game
23106,"I make city, very good."
23107,This is a really relaxing game. Almost like SimCity but with little more options and far greater user experience.
23108,Basic road types gated behind DLCs. This game is an unplayably broken traffic simulator without the modding community.
23109,i dont play the game properly i just flood people and bomb them with space rock
23110,The best city building game EVER!
23111,drown in ur own diarhea mortals!
23112,"ok, it is all about traffic management, but it lacks any politics or possibility of the slums rising"
23113,"It's a good city builder. The problem is the bigger your city gets the longer it takes to load. ( up to fifteen minutes) Trees disappear, dead are not picked up, when there's graveyard nearby. And that's just few of the annoyances.
In all you need quite a lot of patience as the game has quite a few bugs"
23114,the game is good but im bad at it
23115,Awesome to relax and have a challenge at the some time
23116,BUY IT .
23117,"good




"
23118,"Cool game
very enjoyable,
got to the ""ending"" in 10 hours so a bit on the short side for me ( the ending is basically unlocking the last mile stone)
"
23119,I knew this game since last year cause of the Covid pandemic. I play this game till I'm addict it. Good job developer team and Mod crew.
23120,you must try it yourself!
23121,All of a sudden this game requires the paradox launcher and a paradox account - WHY?
23122,A  fantastic game i just cant stop playing!
23123,Absolutely LOVE this game. :D
23124,Fascinating prologue to Cities Skylines 2.
23125,I dont see any lines in the sky???😔🤔🤔
23126,"As city Builders go this is one of the top titles, there are a few gripes i have but they are minor. Move it mod and Traffic Manager are essential and should in my personal opinion be incorporated into the base game. 

Overall 9/10."
23127,"Very nice game ,  a lot
 of fun"
23128,just great to spend free time
23129,people actually like this? 60% of the game locked behind DLC
23130,very good city builder
23131,Very realistic and addictive
23132,Great game that will keep you busy for quite some time.  Much more in-depth than other city building style games.
23133,This game took up a lot of my teen years. I spent AGES making cities and loving every second of it. This is and has been one of my favorite city building games. I'm super bad at giving real reviews other than thank you for making such a great game! The amount of creative power this game gives the player is fantastic.
23134,"this is so good. i love the community here, and though there may be a few flaws, i overall LOVE this game. please. buy it, ITS WORTH EVERY PENNY."
23135,"Community is excellent. More features than whatever the last SimCity I played was, and I can play offline."

23150,yes
23151,yes
23152,Its great. I just wish i knew how to manage traffic.
23153,"Great game with great mechanics and very comfortable to use however it can feel a bit empty without the major dlc (industries, mass transit, green cities for example) but you can get them for pretty cheap (not on steam) and they really add to the game."
23154,Super fun city sim.
23155,loved simcity (2013) but damn this is better
23156,"This was the only Paradox game I put faith in and actually liked enough to buy in its Vanilla state. Look at it now, it's a pile of DLC trash just like other Paradox games. I deeply regret my decision to actually trust Paradox even for once, right now the price of all DLC amounts up to 8 times of the original price of the Vanilla game. Other than those, it's actually a pretty well-made city sim, but as always, Paradox's DLC policy made it no good. I'd say don't even bother buying - not even on a sale - and fueling Paradox's ridiculous DLC policy any further."
23157,barack obama.
23158,Best city simulator I've played. Great modding community who add a lot to the game.
23159,"The best building simulation game I've ever played. Really immersive, addictive and detailed. Don't skip the tutorials or the milestones which allow you to get to grips with the mechanics of the game at a steady pace, as it gets more and more complex the higher your population goes. When you know the basics, you can play in sandbox mode and download an endless array of free mods and assets if you like to customise your city just how you like."

23161,Very Good
23162,Traffic Jam Simulator
23163,"Would you recommend this game to other players?

YES

I want them to feel how stressful dealing with traffic, anyway it does fun building your own dream city and all, the vanilla only already provide that but the dependency of the game for new stuff or mechanic with DLC is really bothersome and some of them not worth it"
23164,"Well, I mean, I sunk 160 hours into this game during a time I was setting up my business, working 70-80 hours per week, in under a year .... 

Fair to say, it's pretty bloody addictive - my most favourite being the industrial DLC I got!! Absolutely love it!!"
23165,Workshop makes this game amaizing.

23167,dis shit fun
23168,"I like this game very much and recommend you to play go for it
"
23169,Steep learning curve but absolutely infinite (and I really mean it!) possibilities. Well worth your money (and all that i've spent on DLC)
23170,Best city builder!
23171,Not bad
23172,yes
23173,Yes
23174,"it is great got it a couple years ago one of my first games :D



but there is a lot of DLCS"
23175,"Good fun. It is missing some features I'd like to have, like mixed zoning, but it is still fairly nice overall. Includes nice ambient music. Has too much DLC, though."
23176,.
23177,Great game especially with the DLC's.
23178,Addicting
23179,drown the peasants with their own bodily waste
23180,It's a fun game.
23181,"City Skylines is a great simulation game. I really enjoy the mechanic of building a city from scratch and then sitting back and looking at ones creations, different highways, commercial zones, residential zones, etc. I does get a little repetitive though however there a always new maps and assets to discovery with steam workshop. Downside for new players is the cost of dlc which unfortunately has become common practice nowadays. With some aspects being made dlcs that should have been included in the base game. Anyway if you enjoy similar games to this then you will enjoy this game as well."
23182,"I'm fairly new to the Cities: Skylines game. So far I love it. I'm learning new things about the game, mods and how to build giant cities."
23183,i love cities skylines
23184,So boring. Get out into the real world guys!
23185,"Overall this is a fantastic game. Now on it's own this game is okay, building cities and watching them grow is a cool concept. But when you bring in the modded content this game is elevated to a whole new level. You can start doing the wildest shit with this game. You can build volcanoes of sewage and demolish your cities, you can create cities on giant platforms far above the rest of the world and watch as cars drive up to those cities at a 90 degree angle. This game rocks."
23186,"This game is pretty great on it's own but with a few mods, this game blows all other city management games out of the water!"
23187,Very Addictive --  but real fun
23188,It's ok I guess
23189,Awesome
23190,"I love this game, you can build what ever you want, mods make it 100 times better than it already is."
23191,good game
23192,i can finally have ungodly power over tiny little people and create mandatory toll roads najahahahahah
23193,Very fun game. Like much
23194,Nice game
23195,it's fun. It's well coded. What more do you want
23196,"Recently got into Cities: Skylines, I used to play the very old Sim City games. This is so much fun and totally takes me back. Cities: Skylines is on a completely different level from the old games though, so many angles to think about. Played one map in vanilla mode and have recently been getting into using mods and adding assets etc. Love this game!"
23197,It's what I always wanted SimCity to be
23198,best city builder sim <3
23199,I played this game when it came out but for some reason put it on the back burner. I just pick it back up after a while of not playing it and I couldn't stop. Graphics are amazing. You can really immerse yourself into building. I enjoy the realism that the game offers when it comes to all the components that a city requires in order to function properly. Highly recommend. I like that it isn't overly complicated to play yet it still has challenges to keep you going. Definitely will be putting this game back in my rotation.
23200,"You can build your own city, really recomend."
23201,Great game! I have playing this since it has came out and cant believe what the game has accomplished. It also very satisfying to see your city run smoothly. Also remember your always at war with traffic >:(
23202,its the perfect game for people who love economics and stuff
23203,Unplayable. Installed the game and tried to launch it but doesnt want to load. I took a few mins to look up alt way of loading the game but gave up. It shouldn't be this difficult to just get a game to load up.
23204,Getting lost in it. Awesome game!! :D
23205,Never makes me bored!
23206,Best city sim yet
23207,"This has been my go to game when i just want to relax. I love the fact you can use your imagination when it comes to building a small town, or even a busy metropolitan. I do recommend finding some of the mods that will allow you to play more of a sandbox style such as unlimited money, no pollution etc. The DLC's are worth it and I have purchased a couple to add neat features to my game play but not required if you do not want to buy them. If your looking for a game that's relaxing I would recommend this one."
23208,run
23209,no it will ruin your life
23210,very fun to build a city and then destroy it
23211,Mediocre sandbox experience with plenty of DLC to keep shareholders happy.  I don't think they had player enjoyment in mind with this one.  Nothing about it is genuinely entertaining.  It is pretty but unplayable without mods ... just badly designed and the interface is frustrating and sloppy too.  Modding the game to fix the worst flaws just creates new issues like having to micromanage traffic.  I can't think of a real reason to play this game.  There are older and cheaper games to play which do everything this game tries to do and which do it better.  I'd rather play Minesweeper than install this again.
23212,funny people are really annoying in this damn game like TAKE THE DAMN TRASH OUT
23213,"Definitely recommended. Without question the best city builder around. 
I even use it creatively for designing DnD cities in a way that would make sense. Love it."
23214,great city building game rivals sim city but not everywhere
23215,enjoy building tiny citys? like to recreate your own? this is the game for you! from transit to public services city skylines is a great game to rebuild/ build a whole city/town of you very own!  community workshop mods work great to! add a in depth traffic system or even that favourite store you loved to go to!
23216,"They've greyed out the ""new game"" and ""load game"" buttons with no explanation of how to fix the bug to be able to play. It is literally unplayable because I can't launch the game past the main menu. What the fuck?
"
23217,ok
23218,k
23219,"I absolutely LOVE Cities: Skylines! It is just so fun and relaxing to play, I love just going into free camera mode and following a car into the city, seeing the beautiful skyline of the city I created. I do recommend getting DLC, it adds a lot to the game. This is my favorite steam game I have."
23220,It is ok
23221,"This game is one of the if not the best city building games out there you can make huge cities with lots of area and make even bigger areas with mods if you will from the community tab.
"
23222,"Great city builder, even better time kill. One of those games where you just want to play a little bit more, suddenly its 2 am."
23223,very poggers
23224,Best city sim
23225,Gr8
23226,savag dumb
23227,"you: spendin all ur money for your city and evolves it

Tsunamis, Earthquakes, Tornados: are u sure about that?"
23228,Best simcity-like game at the moment
23229,i bild big citi big plans big people big
23230,quite engrossing  learn how to get it working and have fun
23231,good egoshooter
23232,"Can't stop, won't stop!"
23233,In my opinion this is the best City building game on Steam! There is so MUCH that you can do in this game and the community is amazing with all their workshop creations. Much Much better then SimCity!

23240,it makes me cumm
23241,"Great city building game, has taken the mantle from Simcity easily, only qualm i have with this is the huge catalogue of DLC and the overall cost, picking it up on sale is certainly the direction i would go."
23242,Great game. Like the best parts of Sim City. Also looks beautiful.
23243,The best city simulation game!
23244,Its a game 16.5/7

23246,YYAAASSss
23247,great game!
23248,good game but you gotta understand traffic or else it gets unfun after your city wasnt laid out right

23261,"9/10, my city has a major cholera outbreak"
23262,The Best City Builder since Simcity 3000. Excellent DLC & great mods.
23263,"After 117 hours. I have ran into not one but two game breaking glitches. I tried to find a fix for the glitch and to my dismay it appears that ones has been widely known since 2016 (death waves) and the other appears to have been known about since at least 2018 (based on Reddit). The second glitch is the garbage trucks, police officers, and hearses just refusing to spawn. I tried not using 1-way roads to fix it as others have had success with  that. However, it still occurs, my city goes broke, and game-over. For the death waves glitch there is a mod that successfully fixes it. I tried the mod before writing this review to see if that works and it does. As for the city services not spawning to patrol for crime, pickup garbage, put out fires, etc. I have no idea how to fix that. I did read that it is an AI issue that occurs with larger cities and that checks out since it only happens once my city gets to around 300,000 people. Still, no point in playing if you aren't going to go big."
23264,"I've been looking to fill a city building simulator void since I lost my copy of SimCity 4 years ago. The disastrous rollout of SimCity 2013 was a huge disappointment, and other SimCity games (Creator, BuildIt, etc.) are too shallow. Luckily, Cities: Skylines is everything SimCity 2013 set out to be and more. The game is wonderfully complex and requires a great deal of strategic planning and foresight, much like other Paradox titles. But that challenge is what makes Cities: Skylines fun. I'm only 24 hours into the game, but I can easily see myself spending hundreds of hours over the next few months trying to create a massive metropolis."
23265,When you have traffic issues just throw a Meteor at them and everything will be sorted.
23266,I like building to escape reality because i get beat in my basement
23267,Make sure to get the DLC. I made the mistake of not getting it
23268,Best city sim out there. The biggest problem with the game is the identity crisis it has. The devs should've decided on whether or not they wanted it to be a European or American sim because they just made it both in a weird way.
23269,VERY yes.
23270,Awesome
23271,"It's a kind of cool (not to scale) mod-dependant city building simulator. But it is hardly a game. The lack of gameplay features is frustrating. Poorly implemented gameplay features (such as resource manangement in industries DLC or the scenarios) are even more frustrating.

It's like Lego. Build what you want. There are no rules. And if there happened to be any game rules they are totally overridden anyway since the game is more or less mod-dependant which override many of the so called ""gameplay"" restrictions."
23272,"Fun City builder. Have yet to find a better city building game. Similar in flavor to the old school sim cities when Maxis ran the show and not EA.

Good game, got turned on to this game from biffa fixing traffic jams."
23273,"What a game... and with the mods... if you have any interest in sim cities style games, this game will consume many of your hours, you will revel in the looks and lives of the sims in your city.."

it may be laggy to laptop users but its good"
23278,haven't got past the tutorial
23279,good game but keep crashed.
23280,"Left EA to become just as bad haha
Requires a ton of additional expensive content to seem complete, cant rebind most keys, main menu advertising and it just never quite felt fulfilling like husk that was Sim City.
I accept that this game provides more content and lets you micro much more than any other city builder but for me it feels like a two steps forward one step back at best."
23281,NICE
23282,I like it.
23283,"This super nice game for build an city and i very like it
"
23284,"I work in a municipality on Argentina and I can say this game teaches a lot about city planning . At first I liked it simple but then I wanted a more complex game more related to reality. So I would recommend just that, start with vanilla. Once you get the game start adding the DLCS a few at a time. That way you will like it better. You wont get burned out by all the data you have to manage if you add all the DLCs from the start. And if you want even more realism, there is plenty of content in the workshop to add, lots of mods. And I am sure, with time,  they will improve even more with these aspects. If you are not looking for realism and just fun, you can surely get that too.  Thanks to the creators for this game."
23285,fun
23286,"I love Cities: Skylines.
The game has a Zen Garden quality to it that ends up siphoning endless hours of relaxing playtime.
My mere ""97"" Hours isn't a reflection on the game lacking content, I have to make an effort to not play it.
Once I get into the flow of organizing my new city, I can lose an entire afternoon, maybe with an evening.

It's so very intensely enjoyable.
Then you get into youtubers like Biffa, you get a few mods, traffic Managers etc.
You get really intense about your road networks. Maybe you use the amazing steam workshop to customize your City to look Germany, English or Japanese. I had a blast populating a city with custom billboards, street names.

I don't know if anyone sits down with this, and thinks to themselves: Today I want to spend 3 hours re-arranging roads.
However, every time I boot up the game, I do that, and I end up having a wonderful time.

If you're binging a tv-show, this game pairs nicely with something on a dual monitor setup.
"
23287,"best city building game. Very high on details especially with mods.
graphics are just perfect enough.
very chill and laid back game."

23290,GREAT GAME

23294,69 hours of ingame pleasure. Nice
23295,Dis Good!!!

23299,nice game... doesn`t sync the saves tough
23300,yes
23301,its good
23302,"I think this game is a great City Builder Simulator. Think of this game as being a Mayor of a metropolis just waiting to be built and destroyed by your own liberal laws. I love increasing taxes on the middle class even though I promised I wouldn't. Trying to work around traffic routes, building codes, infrastructure layouts and office buildings projects is the best way to waste your time. (I have 50 hours played on the playstation for Cities: Skylines)."
23303,"I'm pretty new to this. I've been playing SimCity for over 20yrs but this is like SimCity++++!
It can be a pretty steep learning curve, and I haven't got my head round everything yet, but the experience is enjoyable, and it feels more organic than SimCity."
23304,love it
23305,great
23306,its fun but you can rage on this game :/
23307,Really excellent standard of game
23308,"Je viens de découvrir ce jeu, sur le tard.
Il est top, et les modders donnent une énorme valeur au jeu!
Merci à tous."
23309,"The best city-building game there is. Strongly recommend, you can mod it until the point it will run in 1 fps. You can even play multiplayer using multiplayer mod and Hamachi. It's just great!"
23310,"I build chernobyl people get sick why so i go get them water so they need house i put graveyard everywhare
thay no happy so its a ghost down yes now go play this 1st person shooter"
23311,"   
"
23312,"This game really is a timesink in the best way possible. For countless different cities, I have started up a small town, slowly amassed resources and built up my infrastructure, and grown it into a bustling metropolis. In my opinion, the enjoyability of the game comes in the middle stage where your city is big enough that you have the money to do what you want, but not so big that its traffic and transit begins to grid to a halt (coincidentally, this is also around where my computer grinds to a halt). In that middle area, you get to experiment with different city plans, interchange types, and modes of transit in a hands-on way that you could never really understand on the scale of a real city. This is a game that teaches you things, like best practices for urban planning and roadway design, and I love games that teach you things. Also, the robust mod scene really enhances the base game, extending the fun into the hundreds of hours."
23313,"f**k your artificial intelligence

23320,"This is an excellent builder game with a ton of depth.  There's a huge community of people building mods for the game to add different vehicles, unique buildings, parks, road types, and much more so you can customize your city in more ways that I ever thought possible."
23321,"I love this game, although it can sometimes be confusing i quickly got the hang of it and love it"
23322,This game is quite addictive as you watch the city grow.
23323,Cities: Skylines? More like TRAFFIC: SKYLINES!
23324,it's fun
23325,"Fun game, takes some thinking to be good at"
23326,Best game I have ever played.
23327,"Although I recommend this game, I also don't. If I'm being completely honest, this is like most Paradox games in that it takes forever to play, it's very meticulous, kinda tedious and all around just complicated to the inexperienced. 

People who are regulars to Paradox games will most likely understand understand what I'm talking about.

Now, all these things I just said makes this game sound bad, but it's not true. I like these kinds of things in games, but it's not for everyone. Hell, I have 3 other Paradox games in my library right now. I wouldn't say it's a reskin, but you can definitely tell that Paradox made this game. All around, I might say 9/10 if you want a much more elaborate version of Sims City."
23328,"build city
city has too much traffic
fix traffic
city does not get enough goods
make sure city gets enough goods
everyone in city gets sick
try to make everyone healthy
everyone dies

23330,great game
23331,"yes
"
23332,"moist game, rough start but quite relaxing and stimulating."
23333,Cool. But last time it didn't save my progress. :(((((
23334,Its great!
23335,You'd really get to enjoy it more when you download assets and mods to make your city look more real
23336,"THis game is not just a game, its a true citybuilder sim. Amazing"
23337,"good city builder
+ u can get play for more than 2 hours without getting bored"
23338,gaming
23339,"Very fun game, I love it!"
23340,very good
23341,"This game had so much potential.  However its user interface is incomprehensible.  good luck trying to get mods to work, because even after selecting them, adding them, subscribing to them, and selecting them again in the game, you still can't use them. 

As with so many games these days, instead of playing the game, you spend your time performing admin, and problem solving .  Save your money."
23342,"not for potato pc,
big workshop
and wide community."
23343,"i love it, no cap"
23344,I love the game.
23345,The modding community is the best part about the game.
23346,This game is great to play when you're high
23347,no
23348,"The deepest game I've ever played. No two cities are the same. 

It's my zen garden. Play it if you're a logical thinker and want something to help you relax."
23349,beware of burning out fast
23350,yes
23351,stayed up till 4 and tried to fix the trash problem in my city. Very fun game.
23352,Gets the creative juices flowing!
23353,"Some of the mods, such as TM:PE, should be baked into the game by now."
23354,am salvat kuk city de la faliment. 10/10 o sa cumpar din nou
23355,Good Stuff.
23356,"building go boom, money go down"
23357,I disallowed negros into the nice area of town. Thank you for making my dreams come true! :)
23358,"I love killing my citizens in unbelivable and inevitable pain, and make them drink their own shit"
23359,The best city builder game out there.
23360,"Best Cityplaner game out there and a true succesor to sim city! Game itself is great and no complains about it! 1400 hours plaied, any questions?!

Paradox DLC strategy on the otherside..... Scr e w You!"
23361,"Feels very incomplete and poorly programmed/written. If you compare this to earlier simcity games, lots of water under the bridge and very little development. Edit 2022. Question for the developer
You guys are apparently no longer developing or working with the game? The flow of traffic, taxes and many other issues have raised questions among players and this has lasted for years. You develop more dlc sections and you don't answer players questions. You're just cashing in on the game, you have no intention of fixing it or develop the game forward?"
23362,"Takes a while to understand why traffic hates you. Once you do it becomes a great creative outlet. If you like Sim and Building games, this is for you. If you don't why are you reading these reviews? Seriously. Smh."
23363,THE best city builder currently on Steam. Endless modding support too. Worth picking up at full price but does go on sale regularly along with the DLC.
23364,ok
23365,
23366,"Let me start off with I've only play this game with unlimited money and unlimited resources and I still have a ton of fun building my own city. This city building game is very impressive. There's just something satisfying about building neighborhoods and watching them go to local parks and living their daily lives. Then when your city starts to grow and you have downtown skyscrapers filled with people walking through the streets, using the bus/metro/train stations to get to their destinations feels like a truly breathing city that has purpose. Not to mention watching industrial trucks import and export goods feels good to look at. This game is fun :)

"
23367,The modding community is amazing and the game is also extremely addictive.
23368,Best Simulation Game Ever! Better than Minecraft.
23369,So glad I bought this - with all the mods and assets available on Steam it makes for hours of escapism!
23370,its great fun i really enjoy it
23371,Great game! Fun for all ages too :)
23372,why cant i play on my tv this game fucking sucks
23373,Fun road congestion simulator
23374,Good Game
23375,"A very rich and detailed game.  The more you learn about it the more amazed you are about the level of detail the developers have gone into.  Opening the game up for mods was inspired.  There's some great mods out there that add to the richness and playability of the game.  Personally, I would recommend this for someone who has the patience to learn and understand it."
23376,therapeutic
23377,"It is good game
"
23378,its good
23379,is good
23380,the best city builder you can get right now.
23381,Very enjoyable game and unlike this review it is very in depth
23382,Better than sim city.
23383,"This game is literally the best thing to exist, Paradox makes the best frigging games."
23384,"just a great city sim, probably the best"
23385,You create your own problems the larger you get. Its pretty fun. I'll sometimes use real world examples to solve my in game problems.
23386,City building and traffic simulation at its finest.
23387,Good
23388,Yes
23389,i like how it is so realistic. i love it.
23390,its a really fun game with some good mods the only thing i dont like is no older style buildings
23391,The only game I can play for more than 15 hours at once.
23392,Best game!
23393,"Expensive, but still fun"
23394,"City Skylines are one of those games where you can sit down and relax for several hours. We all know before City Skylines, SimCity 5 was the go-to game if you want to build nice beautiful cities with fantastic graphics at the time. Unfortunately with SimCity 5, the limited space the players had, limited its full potential as well as no full mod support, however, these are the biggest issues fixed within City skylines. 

To me, I would say city Skylines is the best city building game we have to date and while yes, the game is not 100% perfect, it is nevertheless a game we can enjoy with the vast amounts of mod support that give the players the endless potential to their magnificent beautiful cities. I have built and constructed countless cities throughout my time playing and I would say that modding has made my cities so much prettier to look at and opened my eyes to how Mods can severely change a game from great to best. For that reason, this game will not die for a couple of years as modding will keep it alive like fantastic additions like Hyper Towers and World Wonders.

Some DLCs this game has, adds various concepts that I think should have been within the base game like After Dark or Mass Transit, however, they are some that are unique that I do think was a nice addition, and if any player likes what the DLC contains, the player can purchase the DLC and enjoy it. Anyone with an amazing creative mind can create fantastic cities that even surpasses mines, the limit is only your imagination thus you are the only one that can make or break a city.

At the end of the day, I would suggest anyone who has spare change and loves city building to pick up this game if you haven’t and give it a chance."
23395,"This game has a lot to offer and is generally pretty fun, but eventually it just turns into Traffic Manager 2015"
23396,"There is definitely a learning curve. I started in sandbox to get a feel for the game, then I took it slow with an actual city, and it's really fun so far. Game mechanics are in-depth and straightforward, but there is a lot to manage. If you're up for the challenge, I would absolutely recommend this game for anyone looking for a realistic city management game."
23397,"Great game, I'd definitely reccomend the Traffic Manager Mod, multiple asset mods however can cause your RAM usage to go through the roof"
23398,"Incredibly absorbing, go from designing a whole district to micromanaging a single interchange."
23399,I just like watching a dude walking down the road going nowhere in a big city.
23400,"idiot traffic, idiot drivers! Develop npc!"
23401,Really good game.

23416,Super adictive!!!!!! I love it!
23417,Fun but challenging game. Not for the weak minded!
23418,"this game was a gift, and i enjoyed and still enjoy every moment of this. Hard in places but you need to understand the rules and logic, when you do that, its way easier then it seems. Mod community is astronishing. QoL mods are recomended  to get the best experience tho, if you want to advance to higher cities!"
23419,Better than SimCity
23420,"Great city development sandbox with an amazing community fuelling tons of great content through mods, maps and assets."

23431,What sim city should be!
23432,"Offers what Sim City could no longer fulfill. 

A (less clunky) sequel would be great!"
23433,"Starting from a small village of only 1000 people ! LipTopia is now a metropolis a vast city that would make the gods lust with envy ! 

A well planned public transport system that does not work ! 
A well funded police network that is uneducated !
A fire department that has no running water ! 
A garbage collection service that has the dump at city centre !
A oil industry sector on land that has no oil ! 
A welfare and hospital system that takes a week to get a small appointment !
And a slight just a lil (maybe alot) corrupt local government ! 

This is the best city in the word why ? 
Because I said so ! (hands you some cash)"
23434,"Adictive, Entertaining. Love it"
23435,i can smell the neoliberalism
23436,"This is the best building city game ever, the destail is perfect, and this is likely to be realistic and i can imagine the city i thought really well."

Also, this game costs 200€?? Paradox ruins everything it touches."
23440,"Honestly, every limit you find you can fix with an asset or a mod this game has endless possibillities its challenging, relaxing and enjoyable. it can feel intimidating but its not that hard although there will always be more problems to solve the more you develop your city. 

10/10"
23441,One of the best simulation games.
23442,its very epic
23443,this is really one of the best games EVER!
23444,quite exquisite

23446,Creativity and fun
23447,its ok
23448,"Solid city sim, with active community providing tutorials, guides, custom assets etc. Price is the only downside, as the million and 1 DLC packs add a small amount of (admittedly interesting) mechanics or assets, which is absolutely not required to enjoy the base game. Music Stations are a rip-off. Grab it on special when you can."
23449,If you like city builders and management games you'll love this one.  Also great for people who are into model railroading who don't have the space to setup a large city sized layout.
23450,Good game.
23451,"tbh i have no idea wtf im doing but like, its still fun. of course, be cautious of many dlc as this is of course, a Paradox Game."

23455,This is a fun game that I sink many many hours into. I have not even somewhat mastered the game.
23456,It's so fucking addictive man...
23457,"This game came out 6 years ago.  It's still solid.  The only comment is to folks complaining about DLC.  Ya know, it's still a great base game, the same I paid for 6yrs ago.  They could have stopped there.  The DLC is what they have added over the years.  I mean, it's not free to keep releasing content.  I'm not depending paradox, but I am just saying...  they are doing more than a lot of companies who release and done.  And you always wish more was done.  Well they do more, and then you complain you have to pay for.  I do think they should have some newer ""2021 Edition"" or something with about half the DLC bundled."
23458,"Can't stop, won't stop."
23459,This game is good if you like to make your dream city and fun with the abundance of mods and the community make this game 1000x better
23460,hi
23461,I made city. It very nice
23462,its aight
23463,Can waste a lot of time building random cities. 8/10
23464,its fun when you play 1 or 2 times but then isn't enough deep... once you reach the last milestone there isn't much fun in continuining
23465,Wayyyy better then Simcity in my opinion..
23466,"This game saved my life.

I am 38.

My ex-wife and I have a daughter together, and adopted our son together. They are now both 4 years old.

When we were going through our separation, I found myself lost and miserable. I was self destructive. I got so mad one day from everything spiraling out of my control that I punched some concrete in a moment of overwhelming emotion. That caused me to break my 5th metacarpal in my right hand... my working hand... my games hand.. the hand that I held and carried my children to bed with.. The hand I desperately needed to make sure I could continue to provide.

After learning of the severity of my self-inflicted damage, I was borderline suicidal. Keep in mind that just a few months before this, I was the happiest man with no history of depression or anxiety. I have never had fits of rage, or been one to break down and cry, but I was in a low spot that just really buried me from being able to see the light on the other side.

Having nothing better to do, I searched for a game I could play, ONE HANDED while I recovered. I somehow stumbled upon this game and read some of the reviews. I decided that it had to be worth a shot... I must admit, I didn't beat the game, or play nearly as long as some of you. In fact, I may have only played this game a day or two.. With that being said, after doing so, I had a new found joy and hope for life. I was able to put behind me the pain and suffering that had been cast over me. I was able to experience other peoples joy and happiness. I was able to see the fruits of my ""labor"". I relaxed for 5 fucking minutes to this music long enough to realize that I was going to be okay.

After coming to that realization, I turned the game off, and I went back to work. It hurt my hand like hell but I was motivated. I stopped feeling so damn sorry for myself, and I became the father I needed to be in that moment, not the weak boy I was behaving as.

Today, I am close friend with my kids mother. We don't fight, or argue, or say hurtful things to each other. We are parents, and friends.

I now have 3 kids. My third child is, wait for it, ALSO 4 YEARS OLD. The woman I am with was going through a very similar situation at the time of my own separation, and we just stumbled in to each others life unexpectedly. We have been in a relationship for a year now, and are very happy together.

Moral of the story, you never know what life holds in store for you, and if I would have given up when all the odds were stacked against me, I wouldn't be where I am today. This silly little game helped me realize that.

Thank you"
23467,"This game is good for strong computers : 16 gb RAM and better, good video card and proccesor :)
I like this game , this game changed my life!
Recommend for all!
Volejonny_"
23468,one of the best city building sims ive played
23469,"It's a big game with lots of DLC, so ultimately you do not want to pay full price on everything. Luckily there are oftentimes big sales for them. Get the big expansions, they are worth it (though Snowfall and Natural Disasters are optional; I do like Snowfall though). On the smaller DLC, they are not needed. Extra radio stations can be fun. So can be the extra buildings from the content packs, but they don't change the game. Start small, base game + Mass Transit + Industries, and expand later if you like it.

The game has really changed and added a lot since the original release, but in my opinion, it was the best city building game right from the start (and still is!). Some mods I would consider essential to playing with though (Traffic Manager and Rebalanced Industries, plus a lot of optional ones)."
23470,good game
23471,i love this game never  get tired of playing.. when i stop playing this i realize that 3 days has past ^_^
23472,enjoying the game bit complecated at first but fun to play if you like building things
23473,Best city building game i have played!
23474,I’ve sunk more hours into this game than I can possibly comprehend. It sets the bar from which all other city building sims will be measured.
23475,This game is amazing!
23476,great game have had fun for hours
23477,"Only played for a couple of hours so far, but after a lifetime of playing Sim City Classic through Sim City 4 (skipped the last one), Cities: Skylines is absolutely the next step as a present-day city building game. More freedom, more possibilities, and at times even a bit overwhelming"
23478,decent
23479,"I enjoy this game up until now! Either online or offline, it's great having this game."
23480,its pretty mean aye

23487,It's nice
23488,"fun, complicated"
23489,"I do recommend this game, I don't recommend playing with AMD RADEON graphics card (like me) if you have mods. But awesome game otherwise! LOVE it!"
23490,great game but IF YOU FORGET TO SAVE YOU'RE FUCKED. WHY THERES NO FUCKING AUTOSAVE I'VE BEEN PLAYING FOR 4 FUCKING HOURS AND IT'S ALL GONE OH MY GOD WHAT A WASTE OF FUCKING TIME. great game overall though
23491,Chill game. Hard to get used to but still fun.
23492,"its fun and relaxing

23493,good

23501,With the help of workshop and a few of the good dlc's this game can have a ton of replay value
23502,Awesome and addictive
23503,I good man
23504,"The game can be a processor hog. But as far as city simulations go, it get's the level of detail just right. You aren't bogged down in minutiae, but there are plenty of little things to tweak and focus on. As your city grows, you will constantly need to revisit your old choices as the cycle of improvement is constant. This relaxing city simulation is a great way to destress."
23505,"This game trying on creating parts of the world, like Chinese hills, American islands etc. 
And they simply mistaken creating such ""realistic"" terrains, like Das Archipel, Preußenhügel and Das Staubbecken! And their mistake was worst recource managment and terrain creation! They made one of the BEST German territories, to the WORST ones.

( JOKE )"
23506,"Overall City Skylines is a  very solid game City Builder. The DLC's are way overpriced, and the traffic is a nightmare once you get a high population unless you are very familiar with the mechanics. But other than that the game has no real massive downsides that come to mind. It may be complicated at first but once you learn the basics this game can be a lot of fun."
23507,Easy to pick up how things should be and would recommend to all who enjoy building games.
23508,country roads haha funny
23509,good
23510,gud game
23511,"This game is absolutely amazing. I mean, don´t get me wrong, there are tons of things I really hate about this game. For instance, the graphics in the vanilla base game look terrible, the game sucks at utiziling latest gaming hardware due to the Unity Engine and you will probably need a NASA computer if you want to seriously play this game. However, what makes this game so fantastic is its community. There´s literally a mod for everything you might want do to in this game and the substantial amount of assets available on the workshop enable you to build in every style you could think of. It is actually quite impressing to think about how much this incredible community adds to this game, therefore THANK YOU creators, thank you for making this game sooo much better!"
23512,赞
23513,"Day and night, building, human's life look real. But, there is no road for walker , building which is unhappy do not show the reason."
23514,"I enjoy these type of game, they are very fun almost can always come back to the game and still enjoys it."
23515,"After 1.5K+ Hours, I keep finding myself back to the warm embrace of this game."
23516,ok
23517,"absolute bop. I have about 150 hours into the game as of now but that doesnt include the hours i've spent watching youtube tutorials and lets plays to get a better understanding of good city planning (City Planner Plays is my favorite channel). Thats not a knock against the game, in fact I would highly recommend watching some videos if you want some good tips on city planning.

I only have 2 main problems with the game. The first is the DLC. The game has a lot of DLC. I only have half of them and mass transit is easily my favorite and most important.  Another issue I have is I feel that the game lacks depth when it comes to many social issues that face cities, particularly things like poverty. The game doesnt really account for that. The most it has is land value, which only determines whether your buildings upgrade into better ones or not. I really hate sim city, but even that game felt like it had more intrigue in regards to city management. The game actually had 3 different wealth brackets for residential/commercial/industrial zones. It wasn't perfect, but that game had a sense of socioeconomics at play even if it wasnt very complex. You actually felt like the mayor, and crime was a much bigger deal. Thats about the only thing sim city managed to do better imo.

Besides that this game is still really fun to play, and I would still highly recommend it. The game offers so much more room for creating your ideal city than games like sim city ever could. It also has an amazing modding community."
23518,is good game

23521,"it is good and amusing, many mods that can download and develop your ideas in game, but there is a limit or problem that suggest to improve, this game limits the citizen units and instance so that when meet maximum citizens units, although the population size does not reach max, the game is needed to abandon, new transport vehicles and buildings are not work, no one get n the new transport and live in new building, it is very sad, hope that citizen units can be increased more or can be set by player."

23530,"This is a top game, but it lacks a Corona mod."
23531,This game has taken the crown from Maxis and never intends to relinquish it.
23532,I AM THE MAYOR!!!!!
23533,Solid.
23534,why da cars go zoom?????????!!!!!?!?!!?!?!?!??!?
23535,"I spent about 75h in this game before losing interest

The Good:
I found this to be a worthy successor to SimCity 4. The gameplay is solid and it does everything you would want from a city builder. I like districts and naming each road. Terraforming is harder but eventually you get the hang of it. The mod community is great as always.

The Bad:
My main issue is that the game lacks charm. It lacks the quirky whimsical elements of the Maxis games. I found it hard for any districts in my city to develop character. My other issue has to do with the reflection of surfaces. From a distance, cities are just an ugly mosaic of white & gray. It's also annoying to have to place trees one at a time."

23543,"I'm not sure why people like this game. It feels unfinished, and the design is maybe... not entirely in touch with reality?

Unfinished: There are numerous bugs, like the Transit bug where if you play long enough, the transit line's display explodes in size, with a vertical scrollbar across a lot of empty space. Often modifying a transit line is impossible, requiring you to delete the line (and thus lose all of the passengers), and start over. Bus lines often take insane routes that make no sense, between the 2 stops at the end of a line, instead of making a simple U turn. Subway lines that overlap at a station have a habit of trapping the trains, there are no multi-line stations in the base game, and if you report any of these bugs to the author they'll ask that you start over with the base game no mods.

Not in touch with reality:

1) Many things cause noise pollution that make no sense. For example subway stops are very loud and upset the people nearby. I've lived next to a subway. They do not. Meanwhile hospitals are insanely loud, with constant ambulance traffic, in real life - in this game, no noise pollution at all.

2) If your cemetary gets full you can build a Crematorium and just... dig up all the dead. Even attempting to click on the ""Empty Cemetary"" button should get you thrown out as Mayor, and end the game with a photo of you in jail, if the game wanted to keep on with reality.

3) The Harbor has only one kind of ship visit it, which is large (obviously Carnival with the distinctive exhaust tail) cruiseships. Yet these cruiseships bring new residents to your city, which is not at all how cruises work - they're vacation vehicles.

4) It's common to provide something to the map and find it's improperly utilized, with no way to resolve it. For example you're required to connect your city to a highway to start the game. If goods come in through that highway and clog up a street with delivery trucks, you might build rail deeper into the city and place a Cargo Station past the traffic, so the cargo vans can come from there instead and bypass the busy offramp. And voila! ...they... don't. The traffic just persists.

5) Cars are apparently capable of fitting in people's pockets, so parking is disregarded. Any subway station is essentially the smallest Park n Ride facility ever, and that is never explained in the game, nor is there any animation etc to illustrate cars can magically vanish leaving just their driver to ride the subway, and reappear on command.

There are more problems but, to keep this from going on any longer, this game has a lot that makes no sense, and it's frustrating to play. I don't know why reviews are so positive. It needs a lot of work."
23544,great sim
23545,The game is great and has some fantastic DLC but it's the Steam Workshop content that really makes the game worthwhile.
23546,its decent
23547,"Great fun, and plenty of mods to mess around with. I recommend getting a modded map, and make sure you also download all the required props for a map! Great game, really enjoying it"
23548,"I enjoy a good builder and this is one of them.  Old Sim City fan, there could be other city builders out there but this one has coming back each time.  I do hope to see ver 2.0 , they do also seem to work well with the workshop community as well.  Lots of addons on the workshop page."

23552,"Great city building simulator for hundreds of hours of fun. The simulation goes into great detail regarding traffic and city planning. Although some features could be a little bit more fleshed out (this gets somewhat better with the expansion packs though). If you're the kind of person for city building games, this is basically the top game to consider in that genre as of now."

23554,"I like the fact about how:
1) It's a time killer
2) It's very addicting, and
3) It teaches you the basic factors of establishing and handling a city, in case you were a president or mayor of some sort."
23555,Best current age city builder out there
23556,you can float your city with s h i t
23557,"Definitely not a game for everyone, but if you have a city building mindset you'll love this game. I'm very interested in Urban Planning, so this game is pretty much perfect. Cities: Skylines is certainly the best city sim around, it ain't perfect but well worth the time and money."
23558,"Pros:
Its fun to play

Cons:
It has EA syndrome so you should buy this and any DLC you want during a Steam sale"
23559,its better than a basket of paisteys
23560,"Cities: Skylines is a wonderful game in the first 30 minutes. 
Here is a list of what will happen after those first few minutes:
1.Everybody will die.... everybody
2.Garbage will pile up to your shoulders because garbage won't get picked up by your trucks, so you will build about 15 incineration plants. All of the new garbage trucks will completely flatline your trafic flow.
3.Because there is a pile up of cars from here to Australia filed with garbage trucks, your police force can't get to the crime scene.
4.No police means more crime.
5.More crime means more theft and death.
6,More theft and death means less money to pick up the dead.
7.Less money to pick up the dead means that in a matter of time your city will be a abandoned ghost town.
8.You the major declare bankruptcy and lose your home wife and children.
9.The remainder of your days will be spend under a bridge.
10.You try again.

Great game can highly recommend, there also is a ton of more content you can get for free in the steam workshop."

23609,"One of or perhaps the best modern city builder currently available. Slowly but surely getting better and better, in the big part thanks to the workshop and fans who create great content. The best mods, maps and assets eventually find their way into official DLCs. Few years ago bigger cities were unplayable (FPS issues, traffic mechanics, lack of many necessary tools) but now I definitely see progress made."
23610,GOOD
23611,:) Great game
23612,the is one of the best games on building
23613,"I have and always will tell everyone to buy all DLC and the game, I try to get them to buy the DLC for full retail so that Cities 2 comes quicker... If it ever does!"
23614," very entertained
"
23615,"The positive:

- Decent base graphics that can be greatly enhanced with mods.
- The base game on its own is very good on its own, and most of the paid DLCs add other mostly useful fun and/or useful features.
- Fairly straightforward to learn and play, though once you get the hang of it is on the easy side.
- For PC, a never ending amount of assets and mods that can be used to enrich your experience.

The negative: 

- Cities are on the small side. Maximum 9 tiles - each tile is around 2 km long - or 25 or 81 tiles with mods, which you may not fill - especially with 81 tiles active - in full due to a game limit on the number of road and buildings.
- Some performance and stability issues, even on empty maps.
- Mod management tool is poor. Mods are activated globally instead of a per map basis, and you cannot see which mods are in use in any specific save.
- Very poor transit management tools.

Summary: If you are looking for city management game this is the best of the market, not that there is much competition besides the venerable but old and 2D SimCity 4. 

Rating: 9/10."

23653,"The best city builder? Think so, at least with some mods added."
23654,"As someone who struggles a lot with anxiety, I have to say that this game was the best accidental discovery I have made this year thus far.

This game not only allows for you to freely exercise one's creativity on a blank canvas; It also allows for backtracks (as long as you save your city :p). Whatever that you imagine, this game allows you to put into reality and see how extreme you can bring it.

In my short time that I have played this game, I have found myself hooked because of how well it takes my mind off of worrying matters. This game is like my anchor.

However, it does have one bad thing about it -- DLCs. Just to unlock different features requires you to purchase so many DLCs. Quite... microtransaction-esque.

But great game overall!"

23660,"I started to build my first city, breaking open ground between two rivers with great excitement! My fresh water supply got contaminated by my sewage ...and nobody wanted to live where they had to drink poo-water.

My second city was on a great open plain, the sewage disposal was -down- river from the water collection. Rolling blackouts killed the city before it could even start. 

Third city ... we don't talk about that.

Fourth city I discovered how to download a traffic mod so I can try and organise the traffic jams into orderly lines! It wasn't until my sixth attempt at a city that I figured out how to turn said mod ON. 

Latest City, it's a boom town, large and prosperous with a farming industry producing baked goods, an ore industry producing glass and we're eagerly awaiting our first locally sourced lemonade brand! Everyone is very fascinated with one intersection in the middle of the city that is not a major road ... or even en route to a major road, but everyone wants to go there! Even the highway. People are well educated and people are moving in faster than we can build houses. 

10/10, most fascinating intersection in the world."
23661,Chill city building game. highly recommend.

23663,"Without the DLCs, Cities Skylines gets boring very quickly. Buy the DLC or save your money in my opinion."
23664,"The initial learning curve is pretty reasonable, with excellent tooltips to guide you along to basic proficiency, but even after a few hundred hours of playing, I am still learning more about the more intricate game mechanics. It's an accessible city builder with lots of depth, and most of the DLC has proven to be worth the cost as well, enriching the game experience."

23668,"I never intended to write a Review for this Game, but one of the Recent 6 Year Anniversary Post one of my comments was Deleted! 

I played this Game for over 280 Hours, after only playing it couple of hours I realized one thing, that it was unplayable with the logic of the Traffic it has. So I went to the workshop and there you go the Mod Community of many Games tells you really quick what's wrong with a game in most cases. And it apply's for City Skyline specifically!

So after downloading several mods for this game I was able to seriously enjoy the Game, that shows you a couple of things:

1: Most the things were are solved thru Mod's are in a way or other implemented  in at least one DLC they offer, but the Base game is almost like a Demo you get some basic's but if you want to solve certain issues you WILL approach in late game you need the DLC's or Mods!
2: They been hammering on DLC's now for 6 Years nonstop! But nothing has really changed to the Core of the Base-game!
You would assume that all the money from the DLS's should have benefited the Core of the Game, what in only few occasions happened but not really significant enough.
3: It is clear to me that if you want to play this Game in a way that you enjoy it, without artificially invoked issues like Traffic etc. You need DLC's. and that for the Game price increases to $200 and that's not fair to the people were buy the base game to play and enjoy it without being forced to buy a DLC to manage your City properly!

So @ the Dev's of City Skyline, stop deleting people's comments, then most All comments are a feedback from people where play your Game. 
And you should take them as such and not make them mouth dead.
And btw try to delete this ;-)"

23685,"The driving AI makes this game unenjoyable in the long run.
Vehicles seek to change to the lane corresponding to their next action (driving ahead or making a turn):  this means that instead of just entering the highway on the outermost lane and switching to their prefered lane later on as gaps form in the traffic, a stream of trucks will often just thrust trough to the opposite side and paralise the entire highway miles before the exit point they are so desperately trying to take. You can try to re-direct the traffic the best you can, it just won't ever be enough, as trucks seem to look for the shortest distance to travel, instead of the quickest route to take.

Aside of that, here are just a few annoying flaws that come to my mind:
-There are certain UI elements that overlap:  the maps screen in the upper-left corner is occluded by map-based pop-ups like ""this building burnt down"", but the information to the map currently open remains in the foreground
-The localisation of UI elements is often questionable: for example the ""cinematic view"" button (which one rarely, if ever uses) is right next to the buldozer button (the one button you'll likely use the most in the game) so you are in for some surprises
-the water behaves like an amobeoid creature: if a river splasher over the shore, a piece of water can detach itself and wobble around akwardly. That might be funny on its own but makes designing shore lines and dams tedious and unpleasant

Cities: Skylines might be one of, or even the best such large scale city-builder but it really doesn't set the bar high, and for all the good it has to offer, the bad design of the game puts a rather large strain on work flow, if you have become an experienced player.

23711,"I have to say, this is one of the best City building games since Sim City and its even better than that. 
In my opinion you can do anything in this game, hell you can even rename your Citizens and buildings to anything you want to.
I really like this game to play casually when i'am bored, yet sadly there are many things to reconsider.

1 major downside is the DLC stuff with that game. Instead patching the game or updating it with some new content, you have to buy an DLC for lets say ... Industries or for building actual Parks. (you can build parks in the vanilla game too, yet not as big and none of those will make you any income, only those from the DLC you can build.)
Of course some people think its worth it but in my opinion, am really not wanting to spend 200,- + on just DLC's alone.. 

Another thing is, (i dont know if it happened to others as well) my public transport routes just broke from now to then and i tried 1 week long to solve it on my end, without sucess. Than i had bought the 'Mass Transit' DLC and low and behold, it worked again. I dont know if its willingly made from the devs to make it so you have to buy certain stuff as DLC or if just some Mods corrupted it a little so it just broke.

Thats about the negatives i can think for right now but overall its a nice game to relax and build your own city.. and than destroy it with natural forces so anybody just dies within it and noone will survive it from the many many people who just worked at the Nuclear Powerplant before. ha.. always fun to do that.

Anyway i can recommend the game if a Calm and Relaxing City Building theme is for you, just be aware of the DLC Hell and the mods you have to install to make it easier for yourself (most likely for traffic ha.. )

23722,Skylines is a great game but can feel like a traffic management game at of the time. ... That being said Skylines is just miles ahead and is actually a city building game.

23725,no other game made me sit and watch cars go on an interchange i spent 20 hours to make
23726,"I like these style of games, the ones that gets my brain moving. All though it was tough to play on my older system I still enjoyed it. Now that I have a new system I am sure it will be even more interesting to play."
23727,!!

23729,I am addicted to this game.
23730,Cities Skylines is such a fantastic game and so much fun. It really does get you thinking.
23731,worth all my monies!
23732,good
23733,"This game is great and easy to follow and understand. The game is very relaxing and there is no sense of urgency when playing. Just build, create, and enjoy the music. It has increased my love for sim building games. Discovered this amazing game on PS4 and was excited to learn it was available for PC and for a long time too."
23734,good
23735,very fun
23736,"Great game, nice city building and the graphics are very nice. Amazing with some mods installed but they're completely optional. Just make sure not to sink too many hours into it ;-)"
23737,Really fun and challenging
23738,NICE
23739,10/10 would pay for traffic jam simulator again
23740,"A great game I keep going back to, I'd say the best City Building game there is.  When you have all the DLC's you get to do so much and the workshop is great aswell.  I have even got friends to get this and they enjoy it as much as I do."
23741,a good rating for me
23742,"Great game, great graphics"
23743,"The base game feels incomplete without the DLC.

Since those DLC are unreasonably priced (even during the best sale), I cannot recommend the base game."
23744,"this is a cool game, its fun when you make a city. let it grow and make money."
23745,Addicted!
23746,tons of fun
23747,"This game is generally acceptable. The mechanics are fairly competent and a large modding community provides for some interesting buildings and maps.

Two drawbacks for me personally: the DLC packs seem the same in that they introduce some new area to build (park, campus, etc) that you just level up by adding more buildings when allowed to after the visitor number has been hit. Subjectively I find the art style drab and miss the days of the brightly colored and varied buildings featured in the Maxis creations of yore."
23748,Its a difficult but fun city building game
23749,Nice
23750,fun game to pass the time
23751,good
23752,Fun for a while but there's some mods you absolutely need e.g. traffic manager and a mod to have more tiles to build on
23753,It's good.
23754,"I have devoted too much of my time to this game. Not specifically playing, but watching, thinking and dreaming. It has been a sickness plaguing my mind since I was a young teen. My entire life goal was building a PC to finally play this game, and when I finally acquired it, I put less than 8 hours into it. This is one of the best games I think has ever been forged. Buy it, play it, love it. Love it like i do. Let it consume you."
23755,Great attention to detail. Love the natural disasters DLC.
23756,ALl is cool.
23757,"One of the best city building games and i have played them all! Guaranteed to keep you hooked in. With a great modding community, you have infinite replayability. Well worth the money you invest!"

23781,"This game is killing me.

I'm wasting so much time on it. Whenever I start to play it later on I realized that it's not that easy to quite. YES! I'm addicted ! But somehow I can say that I enjoyed it completely.

Nice DLC Nice Mod everything is perfect.  10/10 freaking fun addicting game :P"
23782,i like
23783,Best city builder
23784,You can build and design how ever you want.
23785,"I've had this game for a while, and I've seen more and more dlc (most of which is decent or better) added on top of what already started as a good game (with a few rough edges - smoothed).  I find it somewhat amusing that this game is starting to give SIMS a rival for dlc/expansion content and editions, but if you can snap up bits here and there on sale it's mostly worth it. And if you want to tweak something: there's probably a mod to do it.  Literally thousands.

Honestly, at the point this game has reached now, let me put it this way: Go watch the trailer video up there.  You see those panoramic shots?  Hear that symphonic choir?   The video is not being ostentatious, this game delivers what that video shows and it has earned it's orchestra of angels."
23786,its good
23787,"its a challenage but a fun challenage
"
23788,"Fantastic city builder game. Great game to just zone out with, and construct massive cities. Just don't zone out too much or the infrastructure will get you."
23789,"i made holland and killed everyone and you can do that to

23790,"This has been one of the best games I have ever played. I have 238 hours and I plan on playing ten times that amount. This game with mods is great and truly a game that you should get.

Finally they all shut up except for Elmer. Elmer now lives on his own little rock island. 100% happiness."
23794,"I just love it so ya
"
23795,"It's a good take on a sim city style game, though I wish it were a little more rewarding in the towards the end. Once you have a big city, that's pretty much it, the elite buildings are cool but don't really add anything. The city's tech doesn't evolve over time like some other city games. What this game does do is give you a lot of control over the tiny details so you can build a city that's planned out down to the smaller points if you want to.  Ultimately though, that really just boils down to managing traffic and pedestrian flow which is only fun for so long. 

But then there's the steam workshop support so the modding possibilities are substantial."
23796,It's incredible. Don't buy it until you're ready to spend a thousand hours of your life on it.
23797,e
23798,"sooooo goooood ah ha ha
"
23799, This game does not load 90 percent of the time. DO NOT DOWNLAOD
23800,"I can clearly say without a doubt that Cities: Skyline is one of the best modern city-builder games that available right now. the workshop is full of stuff and you will always be able to find something for yourself. but unfortunately, the developers are adding more and more DLC's that cost a lot of money... all the DLC cost around 226$ !!! that's a lot of money. if you don't have problems playing without the DLC's, go on but I really recommend you to think about that.
I bought the game when it only released and if only I knew that all their updates will be DLC's for money I wouldn't buy the game."
23801,pretty comfy game
23802,Almost heaven.
23803,"I enjoy this game because all the mods are free which improve the game lots and that you can build cities which can go on forever thanks for making this game im addicited to it.
."
23804,no
23805,"If you want to lose an entire day, start playing C:SL. It will be 3am in no time. Build cities in great detail, play god in your citizens lives, make the ever feared poop lake, make the worst traffic jams imaginable, and have better tax and legalization laws than your govt ever will. There is an absolute stupid amount of community made mods and themes available, so if you dont like a mechanic of something, there is probably a mod for it. And if you happen to fall in love with a citizen named Sheila, you have the option to stalk her every move. You do you in this game."
23806,"Don't laugh but imagine this game have multi player and you challenge your friend's village with your metropolis!
IS IT POSSIBLE? ADD MULTIPLAYER! PLEASE"
23807,Very Playable and addictive.
23808,"Very fun game, especially with the downloadable mods."
23809,"If you liked the SImCity series, you are going to love Cities: Skylines! The possibilities and challenges are endless with a thriving community and an immense Workshop-catalog. The only game that keeps me interested in playing for years and years. Almost played 1.000 hours and will do so for the next 1.000."
23810,Best city builder I have ever played. Nothing more to say here
23811,good game yes would recommend
23812,"this is better then every sim city game. after this all sim city is literal garbage
this game is great. all the dlc's add a lot of fun and just being able to manage a city is pretty fun.

Mods also really enhance gameplay in looks and its just so much fun.

23818,better than simcity
23819,ffs stop asking.
23820,if you grew up playing sim city or any city simulation game this is what you are looking for. its intuitive easy to manage and fun both as a sandbox and as a proper simulator
23821,Favorite city builder.
23822,What to say? This is by far the best city building game available.
23823,Lots of fun. Best City building game live played
23824,"having fun, wish i wasn't poor and could afford all the DLC so i can go full autistic mode and build for days"
23825,"Love this game! So much on the workshop and so much customization on everything. Definetely a ram hog, but totally worth upgrading the pc!"
23826,They're making me build a city when all I wanted was to see was city's skylines.
23827,Great Game.
23828,i have a crippling city skylines addiction
23829,Very glitchy and doesnt explain anything well
23830,Great fun!
23831,DO NOT LISTEN TO THE REQUIREMENTS. They are fake. you need at least a NASA computer with a Jet Engine cooler to be able to run this game.
23832,I absolutely love this game!! Hours of fun to be had and the DLC's are definitely worth getting when they're on sale! I've had such a good time playing this game so far and can't wait to sink even more hours into it!
23833,love the game hours and hours of fun
23834,"No I don’t recommend the game, it is a buggy mess. I’ll just hammer out many of the many bugs I’ve encountered. 

1.)If you go to construct your own industries don’t bother making a chain of production past the raw resource.  The game will sell all the raw resources and will not send them to your factories. So you end up with buildings not operating no matter how many raw resources you produce. 

2.)I couldn’t get the hydro electric dams to work. I tried multiple different positions, different rivers, and I could never get the dam to function. It’s basically there to “look pretty”. 

3.)Emergency services are ****ing stupid. You’re neighborhood firefighters will be across the map stuck in traffic trying to put out a fire that was next door to their station while the intercity massive fire station is trying to go to your tiny suburb to put that fire out. Which can lead to a lot of frustration. 

4) The worst part is probably the random “brown outs”.  I could be producing 280 electricity and all of a sudden out of nowhere for no rhyme or reason drop down to 180. I nearly lost the game 3 times due to this. No electricity= no water or sewage= build ups= people moving out= -$2000 income. 
I reuploaded my save to confirm that there was no reason and I was correct. The game didn’t even recognize when I put down more wind mills/power plants. It’s just a bug. 

Ya just stay away until they decide to fix the game. If they ever do. The dlc prices are insane anyway even on discount."

23847,"I enjoy city building games, and I tried some, but this game is my favorite game and i really like it. there is some negative points but i still like this game.
A message to the developers: Please fix the artificial intelligence of the cars! they are so stupid!"
23848,the detail is amazing
23849,Its really good
23850,City building has never been so good
23851,very good yes
23852,Good.

23855,so interesting
23856,Great game to sink hours and hours
23857,its fuckin decent
23858,I have been enjoying this so far for PC. Been a long time Xbox player with all main expansions.  Just got a nice gaming laptop which runs this game great.   Still dont got all dlc yet. But still enjoying it
23859,Great Game!
23860,"Build a cemetery.  Ends up even the start game citizens don't like dead people in the streets.  There's some confusing things like this that make the initial game a little difficult, but once you pick up the basics it's a great city building game."
23861,So Far Pretty Good. A Few Glitches. Eventually I Usually Overcome Them.
23862,terbaikkk game ni!!
23863,"This is the game that rescued the genre from the evil clutches of ""hive mind cancel culture revisionism""."

23875,REAL GOOD
23876,Dont buy gey
23877,"I played this game 70 hours last week
very good"
23878,"This game should be called Traffic Simulator, because that is the only challenging part of this game. It's incredibly easy to reach the ""end game"", where you can plop down uber buildings that solve most of the problems you face earlier on (e.g. a single pollution-free power plant that powers your whole city, or the hadron collider that replaces all schools and universities). Then it becomes a game of troubleshooting traffic bottlenecks so that your commercial buildings are supplied with goods and your cims can get to work.

All this *might* be ok if the interface made building pleasurable. But their version of blueprints (copy and paste of designs) is incredibly clunky and fails to work in common scenarios like there being a slight slope to the land. Not to mention, to copy and paste a design, you need to *exit the game* and load into a separate asset editor, design your thing from scratch (in a limited area no less), and save it as an asset.

I got bored of this game after 2 cities."
23879,Is a good game!
23880,"Traffic AI is retarded, but otherwise the game is fantastic!"
23881,Sucked me in with the base game for 4.99. I'm enjoying it but the decent DLCs are pricey when you add them all up!
23882,"Rewriting this review...
On one hand I have 4 fingers and 1 thumb last time i checked and this game is in the top 5 finger list of the greatest gaming experiences ever!

I not going to list 10 paragraphs of pros and cons and all that nonsense, If you want to lose yourself in a totally customisable and engrossing experience unlike anything ive ever seen before, then get involved here!

Building A city sounds mehhh... but when you realise that every single person and vehicle and building and road and business and attraction has its own individual persona, you quickly realise that its something special. EVERY decision you make matters and effects people!

Unlocking all the different types of items and buildings to make the city the way you want it to look, building a park area for 2 hours so it looks just right and functions correctly to zoom out only realise that half your city hasn't enough electricity and their toilets are backing up! Priceless!
Zoning different areas with special skills and laying out the small towns so they can work on the land and using dirt roads with no street lamps to see truck driving through at night as the only light source and watching the sunrise at the beach sea front area with the cargo shipments you designed is truly outstanding! The game is a masterpiece! 

There is far too much to list...I have only mentioned a small amount of things possible..

With all the DLC and a massive steam Workshop community always making assets and mods to further the experience, This makes this the most enjoyable and customisable city builder you will ever need! I have nothing else to add...."
23883,fun game better then sim city
23884,"With around 400 hours on record, I can really say that this is the best game of its type on market. Endless posibilities, really created in the way that player need to think to resolve problems like traffic. Its really addictive when you start playing it, starting from few streets to big metropolis. Using custom created models and mods from Marketplace really increase possibilities and makes game more interesting. Only bad thing that sometimes shows problem is performance, expecialy when creating big city with vast amount of details and models. Really recommending this game!!"
23885,"This is the best city builder of its time. You can decide for yourself what you want to do and how deep you want to go. Play the game without mods, and try to generate a lot of money? Sure, go ahead. Make the biggest metropole ever without clogging up your roads? Nice challenge. Really zoom in on your city and painstakingly make sure every tiny detail is the way you want it with every mod under the sun? Make sure you have the time (and enough RAM). 

The only caveat I have is that recreating historical walkable cities (of which you'll find a lot of in Europe) is pretty hard; the game is pretty car-centric. There are options though, like policies to make transit free."
23886,"Yes you can build that sleek modern estate with waterviews, dense lush foliage and is close to everything!"
23887,yes
23888,"What's a great game?
A game in which you feel like playing it for 1 hour but somehow you spent 5 hours on it.

This game will be a timeless game, you should buy this whenever you can and of course when you see it in sale."
23889,"Trollface

23890,it is poggers

23893,Amazingly made ive played since the beginning. I hope more content comes out. Maybe bigger maps??
23894,graphics and small suddleties.
23895,"I keep coming back to this game because it seems like a lot of fun. But when I progress past around 30-40k population, I am always reminded of why I keep abandoning it - at some point, for no apparent reason, even after hours of research and investigation, something happens causing a mass exodus and all my hard work is lost. population drops to less than half, my finances are obliterated, and I'm left wondering as always, what changed. If they could eliminate the bugs from this game after all these years, it'd be amazing. But as it stands, you play with the knowledge that at some point it's all going to turn sour and there won't be a thing you can do about it but start again and have the same thing happen once you've gotten your new city going."
23896,"It is a overall good game with mods and everything,"
23897,"Remember when EA put out SimCity as an online only game? Well this game blew it out of the water then, and still managed to be around in 2021. 

I haven't even installed any mods yet."
23898,"Very fun game!  I personally like all of the mods available and all of the different, unique things you can do!"
23899,"gud game
"
23900,Good way to spend a few hours.
23901,"This is a $200 game. You can buy a used bike on ebay for $15, OR you can spend $15 on DLC to give bikes to your city. Not recommended if you play on a limited budget. I'd wait for a 90%-95% off sale in a decade if I want a good game for the $10 to $20 I usually get Steam games for. The base game (that costs $30) is pretty much just a demo and you'd have a better experience ""playing"" the game by watching YouTubers play for you."
23902,it stopped working completely and steam wont let me refund it because it wouldnt let  me close it and my playtime went up
23903,Great Sim-City like experience. Easy to lose hours just building and tinkering with your city.
23904,"The game is is too hard for me but heres a really nice pie recipie,

Ingredients
Dough for single-crust pie
3/4 cup sugar
1/3 cup all-purpose flour
1/4 teaspoon salt
2 cups whole milk
3 large egg yolks, room temperature, lightly beaten
2 tablespoons butter
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
3 firm medium bananas
Whipped cream, optional-On a lightly floured surface, roll dough to a 1/8-in.-thick circle; transfer to a 9-in. pie plate. Trim to 1/2 in. beyond rim of plate; flute edge. Refrigerate 30 minutes. Preheat oven to 425°.
Line crust with a double thickness of foil. Fill with pie weights, dried beans or uncooked rice. Bake on a lower oven rack until edge is golden brown, 20-25 minutes. Remove foil and weights; bake until bottom is golden brown, 3-6 minutes longer. Cool on a wire rack.
Meanwhile, in a saucepan, combine sugar, flour and salt; stir in milk and mix well. Cook over medium-high heat until mixture is thickened and bubbly. Cook and stir 2 minutes longer. Remove from the heat. Stir a small amount into egg yolks; return all to saucepan. Bring to a gentle boil. Cook and stir 2 minutes; remove from the heat. Add butter and vanilla; cool slightly.
Slice bananas into crust; pour filling over top. Cool on wire rack for 1 hour. Store in the refrigerator. If desired, garnish with whipped cream and additional sliced bananas"
23905,i like it
23906,"Ive had this game since Beta.

All you really need to know is this game is far superior to any City game out there and Sim City can do one. Sim City 4 remained the only serious city builder until Cities Skylines came about. 

The mods are brilliant and workshop is awesome. The reason why? Simplicity. Everything is simple. There's plenty to learn but you genuinely do this at a steady pace. Once you get a grasp of the basics the Cities often look stunning.
"
23907,"nowadays it's the best. Period
"
23908,take your time and plan. follow demand
23909,it good real good
23910,its alright
23911,"I used to play this all the time on the ps4 and it has to be one of my favourite city-builders - I mean how could it not :D There are SOOO many things to do - especially with traffic. You can create public transport lines, edit stop signs and street rules, decorate your city, manage taxes, create districts, and, of course, see so many infopanels to do with anything you can imagine. It's seriously worth the money and an awesome game altogether.

It has loads of DLC as well, all which are 100% worth the price - and they're not even that expensive. As well as content packs which just make the game prettier. All in all, if you love city-building, get it. It can be quite overwhelming with all the options but with time the game is so entertaining."
23912,"Pretty chill/relaxing city builder, tho progressively getting more demanding on ur hardware when expanding the city or adding mods."
23913,it's not bad!
23914,"basic game is fun, but the mods make it like real fun and amazingly beautiful. great simulator"

23918,Best city builder at the moment. Starting to realize that having DLCs is a must though; the base game is fun but runs out of excitement after 100 hours of playing.

23932,"I am 52.

My ex-wife and I have a daughter together, and adopted our son together. They are now both 4 years old.

When we were going through our separation, I found myself lost and miserable. I was self destructive. I got so mad one day from everything spiraling out of my control that I punched some concrete in a moment of overwhelming emotion. That caused me to break my 5th metacarpal in my right hand... my working hand... my games hand.. the hand that I held and carried my children to bed with.. The hand I desperately needed to make sure I could continue to provide.

After learning of the severity of my self-inflicted damage, I was borderline suicidal. Keep in mind that just a few months before this, I was the happiest man with no history of depression or anxiety. I have never had fits of rage, or been one to break down and cry, but I was in a low spot that just really buried me from being able to see the light on the other side.

Having nothing better to do, I searched for a game I could play, ONE HANDED while I recovered. I somehow stumbled upon this game and read some of the reviews. I decided that it had to be worth a shot... I must admit, I didn't beat the game, or play nearly as long as some of you. In fact, I may have only played this game a day or two.. With that being said, after doing so, I had a new found joy and hope for life. I was able to put behind me the pain and suffering that had been cast over me. I was able to experience other peoples joy and happiness. I was able to see the fruits of my ""labor"". I relaxed for 5 ♥♥♥♥ing minutes to this music long enough to realize that I was going to be okay.

After coming to that realization, I turned the game off, and I went back to work. It hurt my hand like hell but I was motivated. I stopped feeling so damn sorry for myself, and I became the father I needed to be in that moment, not the weak boy I was behaving as.

Today, I am close friend with my kids mother. We don't fight, or argue, or say hurtful things to each other. We are parents, and friends.

I now have 3 kids. My third child is, wait for it, ALSO 4 YEARS OLD. The woman I am with was going through a very similar situation at the time of my own separation, and we just stumbled in to each others life unexpectedly. We have been in a relationship for a year now, and are very happy together.

Moral of the story, you never know what life holds in store for you, and if I would have given up when all the odds were stacked against me, I wouldn't be where I am today. This silly little game helped me realize that.

Thank you."
23933,"Huge fun and very addictive.  It takes the great things about the Sim City franchise and refines some, simplifies other, and makes it fun and satisfying.  Some bugs here and there, and I don't like the limitations with the rail systems and traffic management options."

23936,amazing game. love it

23938,gud game
23939,"I played this a lot back when it first came out on my flatmate's more capable PC.  that was before most of the DLC was added.  Recently I had a desire to revisit the game after watching a few random YouTube videos.  Sadly I have been now put off due to the price of the DLC needed to 'complete' my game, even ignoring the music and cosmetic only packs this is more than I am willing to pay.  Also having watched videos with players using the DLC I would now be constantly in a 'shame I don't have' feature and my game would feel incomplete.  If they ever release *all* the expansion DLCs that add functionality in a single bundle for at most £25-30 to allow me to play the complete game I would be in but the current cost of around £82 (£130 if you include the cosmetic stuff) is just too much for a six year old game with the most recent of the DLCs being 2 years old."
23940,"Probably finally done playing this. At least until I get a better PC. It is an excellent city builder that is in my opinion only surpassed by Sim City 4. 

This game's strongest feature overall is clearly the transport management. Something about building all the individual ramps of a highway, setting up bus routes, etc. is oddly pleasurable and extremely addicting, and as your city grows you will often have to redesign intersections to fix traffic bottlenecks.

The map sizes are excellent. I highly recommend one of the ""25 tiles"" mods which unlock all 25 tiles of the map for building rather than the default 9.

There are plenty of landscaping options to create hills, flowing rivers, forests etc. in the map editor.

Another plus is that there are tons of mods available on Steam Workshop.

Zoning works in a similar way as Sim City 4, except that there are only two levels of zones (high and low density) rather than three, only high density buildings can be built in high density zones, and zoning is free. these are all unwelcome changes in my opinion. Once you unlock high density zones you have no reason to use lower densities, which together with only high density buildings being able to be built on high density zones contributes to a lack of variety and unrealistic cities filled with nothing but skyscrapers.

Other drawbacks are:
[list]
[*] infuriatingly stupid traffic AI
[*] overly simple zoomed-in graphics and lack of detail (for example, all high density buildings are just in the middle of a monotone, mostly-textureless concrete slab without any landscaping, detailed parking lots, etc. I guess whenever a game like this uses fully 3D graphics sacrifices need to be made)
[*] scale is way out of whack (factories and farms take up the same amount of space as a single family home)
[/list]
Despite its faults this is still an amazing and highly addictive game, and there are lots of mods designed to fix these problems.

9/10


P.S.
I recommend the mass-transit DLC, and the Natural disasters one is pretty good too."

23955,the sims but with unlimited money
23956,I played Sim City 3 and 4 back in the day.  This game is the best alternative and definitely where it's at for 'sim city' games.

23965,yes
23966,good game but be warned it is hard soooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo play i guess i dont no
23967,I enjoyed playing the game however after some time I found it was a pity that the game is designed around the car instead of the individual. ie. all buildings and parks must be attached to a road? This causes for limited freedom in designing what a modern city could be like.
23968,jm
23969,Great if you like sandbox or city building games. The community and support around it leaves you with endless possibilities.
23970,"game... good
"
23971,"fun af
"
23972,Welp. There goes all my free time. Gonna be driving around picking up ideas for street layouts and zoning for the rest of my life.
23973,"When the game came out ages ago it was touted as a sort of better and new ""Sim City.""  I was excited for all the neat looking features and cool city building.  Yet this thing is just way so much more than that.  It's so much more than any Sim City game.  It's incredibly complex to the point that you need to think of, plan for, and predict every little individual nuance.  You're far beyond a mayor, you're the whole team of city planners and every tiny decision can have long lasting and terrible repercussions in the future of your city, so far into the future that it becomes a massive expenditure to even attempt to change the aforementioned decision.

The sheer amount of micromanaging that's required to get a city running even remotely ok is staggering.  The worst part is, the game and all its DLC don't even include all of the tools you'll need to properly do so in every area, for instance the traffic.  While it may seem, at first, to run well, the unfortunate fact is that, over time, it'll start running worse and worse, even if you've properly planned things out, all simply because the traffic AI in the game is notoriously insufficient to tackle the massive amount of traffic the game can so easily generate.

If your goal is to play a fun, simple, and relaxing city builder then this is not the program for you.  If you're the type to want a city builder that you need to micromanage an intense amount of things and spend your time stressed over how every little decision will ruin your day later on then this is definitely the title for you.

I was hoping for fun, more simplicity than present, and a relaxing time.  The game, however, had different plans."
23974,Draws you in and never lets you go! Hours just fly by playing this sim/game. Once you have the general hang of it start looking into the thousands of MODs and extra things available for free in workshop. Truly an amazing game which can also be very educational as it does make you think and forward plan.
23975,"spent over 20 hours making the best city in the whole world just for it to get hit by a wave of death, a flood of feces from the stinky hole, a tornado ripping my city a new behind and the streets clogging up with funeral vehicles

i did do the laughy after that incident"
23976,I only played the game a little bit and I think its very entertaining when you install a couple mods.
23977,BEST! CITY-BUILDER! EVER!
23978,Its more for city builder game. Felt dull and not simulation enough than simcity 2013

23981,yes

23983,Intensely complex but thoroughly engrossing game!
23984,"A fun game that can be immersive, or simply a way to kill an hour.  A good way to chill."
23985,heh i can review this game without owning it
23986,good
23987,"It's an addiction. And then when you get to the workshop, the addiction only gets worse. You can spend hours just watching your city - and a lot of times fixing your traffic problems. But when you do, it's so satisfying! Highly recommend!"
23988,9.5/10
23989,"Absolutely great game. I've been playing the SimCity series since the very first one. I have the same complaints as everyone as to how that series turned out despite its potential. Even straight out of the box this game is way more advanced than the latest SimCity title. One of the huge attractions for me is the terrain mesh engine; it allows for a huge variety of options and it is very intelligent in how it adapts to allow for creative options in building. Overall there's just more freedom and planning considerations one needs to make as they play. The traffic AI is great and presents one of the more consistent challenges as you expand. The detail level of the game is amazing, the potential allowable map area is huge, there's a ton of expansions and mod capabilities, the community support is huge. If you liked SimCity you will love this game."
23990,"This is definitely the best city-building game out there. It's what SimCity 2013 should have been. The modding community is amazing, and for the most part, the DLC's are worth the added cost."
23991,Great game
23992,If you love city builders then try this. I first played on xbox one then jumped to pc so was a huge help to know that there are workshop mods to help grow your cities unlike the consoles so 10/10.
23993,Honestly my least favorite of the Simcity games. That's including Simcity 2000.
23994,My favourite city-building game ever. The only upgrade up from SimCity 4 I'd recommend.
23995,This game is very calming to play for hours
23996,its fun to play
23997,Poop water nearly destroyed the Great City of TomboyGrad

24013,"Crashes instantly upon opening 
Update it crashes whenever I have Discord open"
24014,"Simply put this is the Sim City we deserved, even the music is evocative of the Maxis series. For those remembering the original Sim City and even Sim City 2000 this is the game for you. The level of detail is amazing & modding community extensive. A 6 year old game isn't meant to be this beautiful or enjoyable to play."
24015,fun n chill
24016,good game
24017,"Celebrating 6 years - Yes, it's that old. And still charging for DLCs like M$ Flight Simulator, even some crucial ones. The Base game is pretty boring after VERY few hours and Sim City 4 still beats it by a margin.

The DLCs are just too many and too expensive and there are barely any real sales. A complete Pack for 50-70 bucks would be different, but this is ridiculous. As said, some of the DLC features are crucial and should have been patches."
24018,"Yes, very goood"
24019,so good best city building game
24020,yes good game
24021,"Overall, the game is good except one thing. It is too heavy for my Intel(R) HD Graphics 520 and it can't run the game. Also a bug with it is that because of my graphics card some hexagons around the shining lights. Very good game after all."

Cities: Skylines is all about city planning and building your perfect metropolis! Aside from that you can get the industries and disaster DLC which have brought me a lot of fun.

24044,great game lot of fun endlessly customizable
24045,I really could not get the hang of this game when it first came out. Finally back to it now and there are so many helpful mods and videos I am slowly making progress. Any time I run into a challenge I just Google it and find quick help.
24046,"I have played this game both on Xbox and PC. Only difference are the mods you can download and use on the PC.  Mods are limited on the Xbox version. However, the game play for this game is very fun if you were a Sim City game player. The developers did an excellent job with this game."

24049,"This is a great chill and relax type of game that will make the time fly. Definitely recommend some DLCs for this to get a more full game experience; primarily Mass Transit, Sunset Harbor, Industries, and Green Cities, preferably on sale if patience is one of your virtues. Also comes with a great modding community and in-game asset editors for a unique feel to every city you build."

The game lets you build police stations yet to access the progression to better police stations you need to buy a DLC if you want prisons so your police stations actually make some ----ing sense you gotta buy a different DLC.
If you want it to ever SNOW in your city you need a DLC. £10 for snow.
Just to play the game with different in-game ambient music is £2.50.
Oh and if you want to 100% this game you need to purchase all the DLC.

City Skylines like the Sims or Ark went down the path of making a quarter game and selling the complete game as DLC"

He was at the limit of his patience. ""Stop saying that and tell me where you are!""
""Help me"", she repeated following a deep inhale.
These were no ordinary breaths. Their steady pace unatural and mechanical. Of course he couldnt know this but she wasnt conciously speaking to him. In fact she wasn't concious at all. She hadn't been since she was taken. Attached to her vocal chords like dental headgear sat a spider like machine. Which with each synthetic breath manipulated her throat muscles.

I built a big city up from nothing, worked on cleaning up bad sections of town, earned achievements to get fancy stuff and so on, but as I earned most of the things that are in the base game I realized why there are just a million expansions with little things here and there. About 25 hours into a game you kind of achieve everything and even starting a new game I felt like I was just doing the exact same thing. Not a lot of replay value and it seems like it is kind of designed to sink you in before hitting a boring block that can only be moved by more purchases. 
Would I recommend? Yes, especially if you are looking for a fun city builder, but make sure to get it on a steep discount because the game gets kind of stale after 24ish hours and I don't see what the replay value is. Very pretty though."
24098,Very creative game! If u want to use your creativity this game gives you freedom to do so!
24099,Fun and casual gameplay.  Has steep learning curve with lots of re-playability.
24100,city building at its most comfortable.

24102,"I should love this game.   I played 1 million hours of Sim City... going back to Commodore 64 and then again on pre-Pentium computers of the early 90's.  Sim City is in my top 10 favorite of all time.

This...  I dunno...  it doesn't grab me.  Graphics aren't everything of course... (see Commodore 64 reference)... but the graphics here are... washed out / hazy,  not fun to look at. The sounds are annoying.  

It's not the genre that doesn't grab me,  it's this game and I can't properly explain why.

"
24103,"This is *the* city builder. There are some things I prefer about Simcity 2013, but this is just a better game in almost every sense once you get past that. It's not perfect, not by a long shot, but it will keep you up overnight anyway."
24104,"if you are a city builder this is a game for you unlike simcity this has a lot more it has more space more dlc wich means more fun
"
24105,Go away sims city i have a new babe now!
24106,Best city builder ever.
24107,"Thoroughly enjoy this game. 
Only thing I would really love to see in vanilla is the ability to pick and chose where pedestrian crossings go, unless I am missing something, this requires a mod.
Other than that, great game to play."
24108,build big city realistic style with mod........ then make it go boom

24118,it has it all

24126,"Fantastic! I thought it was gonna be some simcity thingy, but it is actually very complete. There are many dlcs though, but it is nothing compared to other games, as they have reasonable prices (unlike sims 4). Very realistic and gives you that feeling of playing god xD"
24127,"1. Spend 15 hours building a city
2. Have natural disaster DLC enabled
3. massive unavoidable tsunami destroys entire city, no survivors. negative funds

24129,"Top game, big recommendation"
24130,"A hell of a lot more intense than Sim City, great buy!"
24131,pretty tight
24132,"This is a fun city building game. The graphics are good, there is a lot of content and it's just plain fun. This is not a city management game however, so if you are interested in managing budgets and finances, then this is not for you. Add in the phenomenal mod workshop and the possibilities are endless. The base game is without a doubt worth the price, play around and then wait for a steam sale to snag the DLC content."
24133,this game is awesome!
24134,just do it
24135,it cool game it very big epic
24136,"Very fun, u can either make good city that runs epic. or M U R D E R"
24137,"Bit laggy on slower computers but definitely able to deal with it, excellent aesthetic, sounds, etc. Pretty much everything you need from a city builder. Would recommend over everything else, especially Sim Shitty."
24138,good good
24139,Good game and better than other city planner games.
24140,"I love this Game it's beautiful to watch, sometimes I get started and at a certain point I just find myself wonder around the map watching. It takes me forever to expand, I am always uncertain what to do next. I try to build with mass transit in mind and railways, boats, airports etc.. But I often have blank areas that look out place. It is really hard to get a natural looking city, instead I often wind up with a city that just sprang up out of ground. I am also very bad at not being able to tear down /move old sections or structures to make changes that would make traffic better, provide better services or turn an industrial area into a new park. I know it isn't going to hurt anything to just do it, but it pains me to think I made a bad design in the beginning. I am still trying to get the perfect city built from start to finish with minimal after thought changes.

After saying all that, after 6 years we need an updated engine that allows for better frame rate no matter how big the city gets with endless mod/asset usage. Updated graphics would be nice to as well as true scale of size. A pretty tall order, maybe, but doable yes YES.  I'm sure there is a way to reduce CPU usage and increase GPU usage especially now that GPU's are capable of 16GB to 30GB+ memory and high data rates. Maybe use a combination of all three major components of the system in this order GPU, CPU, RAM. Built in HDR and more built in graphic options when it comes to Lighting, Ambient effects and a more natural looking environment. Green/brown hues do not naturally occur/ not visible with naked eye in real world especially in tropical locations, what should be filled with vibrant colors and flora the base game paints everything the same color. 

Just my critique. Still an all thumbs up masterpiece!!"
24141,Amazing graphics
24142,"This is an amazing game. It has detail in what seems like every aspect of your city. If that isn't enough, you can easily add whatever you want with an amazingly implemented mod system. Just a word of warning: it has quite the difficulty curve. Your first city will be pretty awful. Mine died of the ""plague."" Once you get the hang of how to manage a city, though, this game becomes the ultimate in everything from vistas, to management, to creative expression."
24143,"very fun, do play it :3
"
24144,Great game.  Fun to just sit around and watch your city come to life!
24145,"This is my favorite city building game, I've ever played. I loved Sim City as a kid, and this is that but on crack mixed with Red Bull! 
Every time I get on, I'm like, ""I'll just check on things, do an upgrade or two..."" Next thing I know, it's 2 in the morning and now I have to get more housing in quick! 
There a few things that annoy me, but I believe it's the way I play the game. 

If you want to see how crazy you can make it, check out GrayStillPlays on YT. His craziness is one reason I started playing this again."
24146,yes.
24147,plae
24148,One of the best if not the best city sim game in recent years. Highly recommend it!
24149,its not bad but not good there's so much dlcs its not even funny even more
24150,"I have played Cities:Skylines for a couple of years now and it just keeps getting better and better. I use to love playing Sim City and this outdoes it by a mile. You get the be creative, you get fine granular detail on a lot of different aspects of the game and the Mod Community is absolutely phenomenal. Take the time to learn the fine details of the game and sit back and enjoy it. 
Can't wait to see what else they come up with in the future."
24151,I love city skylines and could easily play for a few days straight!
24152,"I have being playing this game for years now. Aftr building a 2M population city i can fomulate an idea. Cities Skylines is a very enjoyable game, the best in the genre, yet it doesn´t have that special someting. When you get that massive town with all the people living in it there is not much else to do. 8/10 For all the fun i had with it."
24153,"Extremely detailed simulation for traffic - the best part of the gameplay mechanics, for me. Also really nice graphics/screenshot features so you can show off your city."
24154,"Amazing for people who like urban planning 
"
24155,amazing game
24156,The best city builder out there.
24157,"It's a nostalgic feeling getting back into a city planning game after several years if you grew up playing Sim City (Classic, 2000, and/or 3000). I didn't play SC games after that one. But glad to get back into it and make use of my new AM4 Ryzen card."
24158,"I can't pair my controller with this game, any ideas?"
24159,Satisfies all the city simulation depths.

What makes it so good? 
Freedom, scale of cities, versatility, amount of content and of course great moddability along with an astounding amount of great mods, both small and large."
24178,This game is what sim city should have been.
24179,fun
24180,"TL;DR
This was once a good game until everything was put into DLCs.
You now have to spend literally 200 USD (160€) to have ""a game"".

Very nice city simulation. I especially like the vehicle traffic... jk

BUT! 
1. The DLC policy is cancerous in a way that Paradox is taking to new heights (CK2, Stellaris, HOI...).
The DLC scheme is so appalling that I simply can't in any serious mind recommend this product. It just silly to expect your customers to pay for every single basic feature and such huge prices. Maybe if these DLCs were priced closer to their actual worth and desirability I might recommend but right now there is no way I would support this behavior.
2. The game quickly becomes a traffic manager as soon as any major population size is met, and it's really tedious. The AI for traffic is pretty bad and it really relies on mods to try and fix it. A game should be accentuated by mods, not rely on it to fix it.
3. It's all too utopian, which I know is a bit of weird criticism. The original SimCity series felt far grungier, with gritty, melancholy music, and the potential for whole swathes of dismal city blocks that looked like something out of the suburbs of Mega-City One. Given Simcity 2000 was release in the early 90's, there's a definite vibe of the 80's depression era. City games *should* have slumps, depressions, crime, social issues, challenges in terms of society and culture. Not once, no matter how big my city get in CS, did it feel like my city was anything more than a larger version of Pleasantville full of happily medicated cims.

Although, the ~200 bucks price tag for full game is pretty funny since many consider 70 excessive. Just hold my beer, right?"
24181,Very good
24182,เกมส์ดีโคดรสนุก
24183,It was pretty fun the beginning is kind of slow but once you unlock a lot more stuff you can have a easier time making all the people in you city miserable. That is the most fun part.
24184,"death by a thousand cuts.... 672 hours played, 472 of the hours were spent in a load screen. Been waiting an hour and a half for the game to load before I got bored. -1/5"

24189,"The game won't let me start a new game plus forces me to a third party website everytime i launch the game to agree to a legal disclaimer (Every single time i launch the game).

What a waste of money. Bought it years ago, played it a bit, thought i would start again but it basically just does not work unless you enjoy a menu screen."
24190,"Good Game, pretty hard but once you get the basics good fun."
24191,"284 hours pretty much speak for itself but I am still going to type - I picked up the base game & some DLCs during sale. Never before had I played a city sim, at first it was bit like whoa but you get use to it.  I love how you can make any city you want - a city with high crime rate and abandoned buildings? - check. a city with 20 amusement parks? - check, a city with highly educated cims? - check, a city you wish you could live in - check. You also have a policies to allow recreational use, what more could you want? The mods, the asset, the workshop is a big toy box you can use to make your city better or worse(?). Wanna feel like you are the big giant in the sky looking over a city? This is the game for you.  Also fuck the tsunamis!"
24192,This shit is the shit. Never did I think I'd care so much about traffic rules. Now I am traffic rule king.

24194,its just great for taking your mind off life for a while
24195,Multiplayer is the best
24196,"nice game
"
24197,Good game that you can do anything you want to with.
24198,"Cities: Skylines is most definitely the best modern and realistic city building game out there. It has its flaws but it has its pros for sure. Ill talk about the pros first, one would be the detail in the game. It has good graphics and it has very in depth gameplay. What i mean by that is you can actually get into more complicated parts of running your city and how to manage your citizens. 

I have played SimCity from 2013 as well and that game is a lot more simplified, just kind of taking the fun and feel away from you. In this game you can do almost everything you would probably wish for in a city builder- and the game implements these things well, not making it too complex. CS also gets extremely addicting once you start building up your city and making decent amounts of money. Overall just a very fun time. 

But then there is the cons. One being the optimization. I would consider my PC to be pretty decent but i get like 45-50 frames on a good day. sometimes it'll average down to 30, making it pretty frustrating to play. Another issue is the content. Vanilla CS is fine, you can get a lot done, but once your city is really big there's not much more to it. However an alternative to this issue is the DLC. There's a lot of DLC for CS but its all very overpriced. You can get better deals for them elsewhere, but I still think its messed up to charge $15 for like 4 new buildings. With all this said, the game is still getting updates and such. Its a very fun game and it goes on sale for a very good price, quite often. I do recommend. Maybe not 100%, but in terms of modern city building, as i said, it is the best."

24210,E
24211,"pretty fun city building game, can sometimes be annoying but otherwise great 8/10"
24212,"Looks awesome, streamlined interface, displays lots of useful information for monitoring and improving the city, ultimately for me it lacks something that would drive me to keep playing and replaying. It's nice that you start each map with only the most basic constructions available and need to build up your city to unlock more, but once I unlocked most buildings and options there was nothing interesting to do. I easily reached a state where I was making money hand over fist and at that point there was no more challenge. Just keep expanding and improving the city. If you really like creating interesting cities and playing around with them then this might be more entertaining for you."

However, as it has been more than 3 years, I think the game's engine is starting to age and could not keep up with the mods that make the game even better. Nevertheless, it still puts sim city and any other city building game to shame."

24295,"I used to play this game a lot, but honestly not anymore. I think the base game is boring and lacks a lot of important things. And the DLC that adds stuff the game really should have had in the first place, is all overpriced.
People called this the SimCity killer, and many think its better. It's not. This title is hardly a game, the only challenge is fighting the traffic simulation and sloppy, poorly implemented public transport lines.

Simcity is still, to me, a better game, especially considering how much less you have to spend on DLC to get the game to be fun.
This is more of a DLC purchasing simulator than a city building game."

Everything that is important is strechted over multiple DLCs so you need to buy every single one of em. I dont need Airballons or Cablecars for a working city, but a tram would be really fricking nice. Honstely, just pirate it, i am thinking about it and this greedy publisher really deserves it."

24336,you cant boar steal in this one but overall better then simcity 2013. f u ea
24337,Immersive city building sim.  Lots of replayablity
24338,fun game
24339,"This game requires you to spend a lot of money for ""dlc"" packs to have the full experience when the ""dlc"" packs are stuff that should have been in the base game to start with."
24340,"Fun, rewarding and challenging (somewhat). Can definitely sink time into it if city building games strike your fancy. DLCs enhance a lot of the game - I wouldn't call them mandatory but they are worthwhile if you find yourself playing for long stretches and want to switch it up a little."
24341,"That Death Wave is the closest video gaming has gotten to simulating Covid-19.

Will recommend the bat soup again."
24342,yes
24343,good
24344,Awesome game for detail oriented people
24345,"Entertaining, relatively forgiving and full of options to develop your city even in vanilla - without DLCs."
24346,its fun
24347,Life Consuming Warning!
24348,"200 hours in the last two weeks. It's a fun game. never payed any sims before this really. The modding community keeps this game fresh and alive, although there is plenty of dlc ( a little pricey though. ) I think we may be able to import actual maps to use in game now, so i think my city will be next :)  really fun game if you have never played this genre before. And well worth a discounted price or sale."
24349,good
24350,"This game is actually pretty good. Really had a great experience playing it several years back when I bought it. 

However, the recent introduction of the Paradox Launcher really made this game literally unplayable. I can't even launch the game since the Paradox Launcher installation constantly fails with no proper guide on how to resolve it apart from ""please try again later"". I had to spend nearly an hour reading online discussion boards and downloading a third-party tool to get the game to launch again. 

Why create such a bugged launcher that only serves to have a negative impact on a quality product? The fact that my experience has gotten worse as more DRM features are introduced really makes me not recommend this game. This sets a precedent as we can never know what other bullshit will they pull in the future."
24351,"ahh yes the shit rivers i have created in my time playing one of my fondest memories of this game i can very much recommend making a lake out of it when you forget to check where the river you are dumping it all flows to.  my poor people all suffering :)

overall this game is actually amazing i have made my first mega city on it and for me it still has some replay ability as early game is extremely fun and i always like to see how i can make the largest most destructive city possible would definitely recommend

this game is great i bet you mum would even like it"
24352,fun game!
24353,"enjoyable but hard to find motivation for any replay value

worth about 5 bucks so def get on special"

24356,If you miss Sim City from back in the day - this is the game for you.
24357,game good
24358,yes big buildy
24359,"this game is ok, but gets very frustrating with all the alerts about different kinds of things, AND ESPECIALLY POLLUTION AND STUFF, THATS ANNOYING. plus many abandoned buildings can happen or whatever.
tbh this game is very complex if you are playing it intentionally, otherwise it can be fun just to mess around in this
also im never buying an extension pack for this game oh hell no"
24360,I have been playing these games since Sim City and this one is the best in my opinion. Quite a few mechanics that I enjoy as well as a few that I don't. I've never had so many options to build with due to the workshop. I can get lost just watching my living city with the rain and snow. The game is pricey with all the DLC's so I would very much recommend picking them up on sale. I'll spend many more hours playing this.
24361,Will make you completely forget about SimCity.
24362,love it :)
24363,"Whether you play vanilla or heavily modded, this game is absolutely worth it!"
24364,big boi city
24365,fun
24366,Solid game. The DLC's are a bit expensive if you want the full experience but over all it's a good game to spend some hours.
24367,Spent hours of fun designing and redesigning cities.  Beautiful game.

24370,I spent hours of my free time reading civil engineering textbooks. 10/10
24371,Great game
24372,Spectacular views and in depth infrastructure building allows you to build any size city in any configuration that you'd like. Highly recommend watching in Cinematic Mode while listening to your favorite chill music.
24373,Much bigger city than SimCity 2013
24374,nice game very relaxing until you try to make a dam and accidently make noah's ark 2
24375,Play this game it is really swag
24376,git gud
24377,[h1] Nice. [/h1]
24378,"I would recommend it and it is a good game. I just have two little niggles
1. Does there have to be a pedestrian crossing at every road junction? (it would be nice to be able to place a pedestrian crossing in the middle of a section of road).
2. Why are there no parking lots in the game? (except for workshop ones)."
24379,yes
24380,Best City building game out there highly recommended if you into building and managing great cities!
24381,"h
"
24382,It is fun and relaxing
24383,"I can't recommend this game enough.  If you grew up playing SimCity as I did, you'll be very happy with this game I think.  For me after work it is very much like a zen garden to play in.  Very calming.  Mods certainly spice things up but the vanilla game is great too.  Play it!"
24384,gud game
24385,Best game
24386,"pumped 75+ hours into a city, cargo ships did not have deep enough channels to reach the route, lowered the terrain underwater, giant tsunami proceeded to engulf my city, hospital and funeral service overwhelmed, hundreds of buildings destroyed by flooding

10/10"
24387," Just an awesome game but not easy by any means. Has a learning curve so you should plan ahead.  Incredible workshop with a whole bunch of Mods that are free.  Be warned, traffic can be a real problem without proper planning."
24388,"Really good city builder, unfortunately my PC isnt good enough to run it at max settings, but i've played it before on Xbox and it's a blast to get lost in for hours."
24389,so much fun i love building  cities.
24390,"I got no clue what I'm doing, but boy am I having fun."
24391,"hi, i keep  getting an error missing folder how do you fix it?"
24392,the amount of useless dlc hurts my soul
24393,"Possibly the best city builder currently in existence.  Only big downside is all the DLC that is just too much at this point.  Than again I guess that is just the industry now...which is sad, but it is what it is."

24399,game fun
24400,Just a fun game if you like simulation gamimg
24401,The best city builder around. This keeps being updated and it just keeps getting better. Well done and well worth the money and time.
24402,Class Game!
24403,.
24404,One piece of advice: don't forget to break for food and sleep.
24405,"Fantastic game, except for the notion that your citizens get MAD when you accidentally redistribute power among the electrical grid, resulting in a blackout that consumes half of the city. Also I'm out of money. Please help."
24406,"good value for money! This city management and planning game is even better than Sim City. Has several DLC and the challenges is endless, especially in traffic management and managing public transit. 

The addition of radio station is refreshing compared to Sim City. Love it ! A definite recommend for other players who are into similar management and planning games."
24407,The most amazing game made of this kind
24408,good
24409,"The game is fairly decent at face value.  However there are a couple problems that ruin the game. First of, the new launcher is broken and buggy. Its an absolute slog to start up. Secondly, only the bare minimum is available in terms of content in the vanilla game. Anything and everything that is interesting is locked behind a $170 pay wall worth of dlc. Typically dlc isn't necessary with most games, but with Cities Skylines its necessary if you want to experience a game that is on par with what it's contemporaries have to offer. Your time and money are better spent else where."
24410,"This is another case of having to put down a negative review, even though the opinion is just ""meh"". Cities Skylines is a great game, and I've enjoyed plenty of hours making massive cities. But at the end of the day, it seems as if the developers have decided to give up on this game and its content; fans of the game would like to clammer on about how this game is different than SimCity2013 and that it's an improvement, but that's just using a 9 year old game as an excuse for modern bad game development. 

Whenever Colossal Order has released major updates, they are taken from already popular mods (public transit line organizer, above ground metro), but then leave out major ones such as TMEP (mod that improves traffic and allows for greater control of road networks). Content that isn't taken from mods and released into the game, is content such as the ""Green Cities expansion"", which is lackluster and filled with ""fluff"". Later expansions such as ""Campus Life"" and ""Industries"" don't actually improve the game, they're just add-ons to existing content, and don't improve overall education and industrial game aspects respectively- you still have the original universities and industrial zoning included with the expansions. After Mass Transit's release, Colossal Order seems to have had the idea of releasing useless content and then putting it into DLCs, instead of actually making improvements to the game. If ever you hear about the developer, it's only because they're doing a stupid livestream with, you guessed it, user made mods; they've basically admitted at this point that their game is lackluster and would be nothing without the user made mods. 

This game is a massive bug mess, even without mods, and Colossal Order doesn't care about fixing any of them. I had to quit a city that I had been working months on, because no matter how many highway off-ramps you put in, the AI will only choose one, setting a chain reaction that will clog up your entire city. It will also take you more than 15 minutes just to load your save game, and even then you have to wait another 15 minutes for the lag to subside, it's ridiculous. 

Sim City 2013's existence does not justify the mess that is Cities Skylines. Colossal Order took their playerbase for granted, and we've suffered because of it. It just doesn't work anymore to deliver a crappy product and pretend that you're entitled to praise."
24411,"I really like it. since its super good and has great graphics, I like it more that Simcity and Even TheoTown. But uhhh... so yeah."
24412,It's ok
24413,nice game
24414,This game is a lot of fun and gets updates very often. I would highly recommend playing with mods because they make the game 10x better.
24415,The best city-building game.

24419,What Sim City could have been
24420,"this game lets me rest good at night, with me knowing my cat is dead

"
24421,"Pros:

- Vast city scale
- Large number of mechanics to manage, like waste disposal, water supply, and especially traffic
- Traffic has a lot of tools, such as Traffic View, to help you manage it and traffic is accurately modelled.
- Similarly, you can create public transport routes using a variety of methods to ease congestion once your city gets big enough.

Cons:
- Underground view can be extremely fiddly - it would really benefit from an ability to strip away the surface layer and view the tunnels with a free camera instead of mainly top-down.
- Emergency services, like police, fire, and healthcare, don't have a great deal of mechanical complexity. Same goes for water and electricity, which become a chore to put down when you're expanding. A road with in-built water pipes would alleviate this greatly.
- There's an unnecessary number of separate road types, instead of having fewer roads with editable properties (one-way, included public transport lines).
- Upgrading roads in particular is frustrating because it's done segment by segment, and it's all too easy to upgrade adjoining roads by mistake. Being able to upgrade an entire road at once would remedy this, especially since there's already a tool to merge roads together.
- Placement of buildings and roads can also be very fiddly since they tend to 'snap' to certain positions too easily, making the Move It! mod a mandatory addition."
24422,"Very good game, the planning and building can keep you occupied for hours. It's very satisfying once you are able to create road and rail systems that don't cause massive traffic, then watch your city grow."
24423,"It is simple to spend hours playing this game without realizing it. Some may see that as a bad thing, but I love it."
24424,RIP SimCity
24425,"Vanilla game is good on it's own, but mods and the DLCs add a ton more content that keeps the game fresh which each new build. DLCs add up in cost pretty quick so I'd advise searching for discounted steam keys or waiting for a steam sale."
24426,SimCity is an underrated game
24427,"Game doesn't scale past 1920x1080 resolution for me, so I can't play on my 1440p monitor without heavy eye strain. Tried looking up a fix, found a lot of other people having the same issue. Also found on the Paradox support forums a very unhelpful staff member, who dismissed the unfortunate user as the cause of the issue. Quote:
-
""Obviously this issue does not affect everyone or it would have been fixed by now!""

How unhelpful is that? If the devs aren't going to bother to make their game playable, even for the minority of people who are having these issues, why did i buy this game in the first place?"
24428,Best game to build cities
24429,"wait a minute
this isnt turbo tax"
24430,me pli tis too muc
24431,godd

24435,Great game
24436,I love this game
24437,This game is super entertaiing and keeps you focusee. Its extremely relaxing
24438,pretty cool
24439,Very nice game. The traffic simulation is so good. This is the best city simulation there is.
24440,"Sim City will rest in peace for a long time. This game combined with community support is unbeatable. Best game of its kind, after 100h still learning stuff... 10/10"
24441,i like building cities and then destroying them with one bad decision
24442,Great game to play after rage quitting CSGO and receiving 3 hour ban.
24443,i flooded my city because i dont know how to build a dam properly
24444,Really one of the best city building games out there. Only downside is the amount of dlc that should have been in the base game to start with but other than that this is a solid city builder that will please both casual and hard core strategy/city management gamers.
24445,Lots of content. Always being updated!
24446,"Good game from when i used to be able to play, but if you have Citrix Workspace then sorry, the game just stops working for no reason. If you need it then don't make the buy :\"
24447,"Probably the best city sim on Steam that I've tried, but that comes with a lot of caveats.  Expensive but sometimes useful DLC packs (none of which are worth it at full price IMO), game logic that is so deep and different that it sometimes feels like learning a new language, and hiding almost all of your useful structures/resources behind a scaling set of milestones that is set off of your citizen count.  

If you weren't turned off by all that, this game is very relaxing to watch (once you're past the initial half hr), has a HUGE selection of assets/mods in the workshop, and is extremely pleasing to the eyes both graphically and in watching all your different systems in action.  I'll mention this yet again - I found that a lot of the systems like public transportation were extremely difficult to gain even a basic grasp of without watching videos.  Highly recommended, but plan on losing hours just learning the game on Youtube, and even more hours losing yourself in the game :)"
24448,good game with a good PC
24449,"This game is one of the most addicting games i have ever played! It is a little difficult to get started but once your in, you cannot stop playing."

24455,Feels great this game! 8 out of 10
24456,good
24457,Just made my citizens drink their own shit. Feeling good.
24458,"First thing - Best city building game I have ever played and owned and I have owned and played many upon many city building games in my 45 years on this earth. Now I say BUT only because of all the Workshop content available for this game. Without the Steam Workshop I do not think I would enjoy this game as much as I do. 

Let me elaborate and talk more about the game's price, PC demands and items from the Workshop that truly make the game.

[u] Price [/u]: Yes at first glance this game is a tad expensive with all the DLC, but when you look at the amount of content and the amount of hours of enjoyment you will potentiality get playing this game, the sales price might be worth it in the end. It was for me but only once it was on Steam Sale and after I got more RAM which I will talk about shortly. Again I do want to reiterate that I do find the game expensive, so I recommend you do like me and wait for Steam sales to purchase it especially because I highly recommend all the DLC to the get best and full experience.

The reason I think this game is expensive is because the main reason this game is so much fun is because of the community workshop and the items and mods the fellow players have created and without it I probably wouldn't enjoy it as much. (Reminds me of The Sims)

So I waited for a sale and I got the entire collection for less than the price of 2 new release games and so far have spend more hours on this game than on most of my other games. So think about it, if you're like me you've probably already spend lots of money on many games that just collect dust in your Steam library, but when it comes to building games I have found my current holy grail but AGAIN because of the access to the Workshop.

[u]PC Specs [/u]: This game may be taxing for older PCs and if you want to get the most out of this game, like I mentioned you will most likely want to use Workshop mods and assets. Workshop items for this game use and demand LOTS OF RAM so I upgraded from 16gigs of ram to 32gigs just so I could use more workshop downloads. (Worth it but also find it weird how much RAM this game can end up needing)

[u]Mods and Workshop Items[/u] As mentioned, Workshop downloads are what really makes this game. Without all the downloads and mods available on the Workshop this game would not be as great as it is. You will most likely want to use the Workshop so keep in mind my previous point. How good if you PC? How much RAM do you have? 

So with all that said, if you've been looking for a city building game, your PC has the power, the RAM and you have the money to spend on the game (with or without a Steam sale) then I recommend it!

24459,"Paradox did it again, an in depth system that takes time to understand but is worth every second. More islands would be cool.

24460,"Could do with asset optimazation so it doesn't use 100% of your RAM. But that's probably partly my fault for having a couple thousand assets...

24470,Simply the best city builder on the market.
24471,"i like it

24472,Makes me want to be a mayor
24473,good game
24474,"I have yet to become bored with this game. It has so much customization to give you almost endless possibilities of creation and customization, and that is before you add mods...."
24475,"This is a game I absolutely adore. I think this beats out any other major city or town building game. However my one complaint is the ridiculous prices on the DLC's. 

In this game the DLC's are practically the backbone of Cities:Skylines. I feel as though the things included with the game is far too little and even some aspects are unrealistic.

You want to have more options on public transportation? You have to purchase the Mass Transit DLC for I think it was around $14.00. If you want to create a *realistic* university you would have to purchase the Campus DLC. If you wanted trams or to build your city in a winter environment you would have to purchase the Snowfall DLC. If you want more variety in industry you would have to buy the Industries DLC. Heck, if you wanted national parks or zoo's or theme parks you would have to buy the Parklife DLC. 

The point I'm saying is that the game by itself is not as enjoyable, but with the DLC's it makes it much more enjoyable. However the prices on the DLC's themselves are way to ridiculous. You could always turn to the Workshop to get unofficial mods but even then you would need DLC's to get better quality items. 

Lower the DLC prices damnit. Other than that, it's a pretty solid game."
24476,"So many hours playing and different combinations, different traffic configurations... I love it. Best city builder out there."
24477,"fun very fun lots of clicking

A couple mods make this game go from great to fantastic, notably the Move It mod and the Traffic Manager mod."
24481,Uh fun sometimes
24482,"I came from SimCity and was very disappointed when EA shut down the studio that made that game, but I found Cities: Skylines and I like it even better. The cities I can build here are so much bigger and I'm a sucker for traffic management, so the options are plenty."

24504,"Fun game will play more, love the mods that are sooooo easy to download, defo would recommend"
24505,"Cities: Skylines is the definitive modern city builder game. Complex mechanics met with easy tools make it a fun game while keeping it challenging as the game progresses. The DLC adds unique elements to the game that make each one worth it in its own way, while mods help to augment the experience, catering it to the player's desire. One complaint I have is that the game is hard to start off with, requiring outside help from online tutorials, as the game does not include enough information or tutorial to properly start off. This is a shame because everyone should give this game a shot, and I recommend checking out a guide from ""City Planner Plays"" or ""Move the Mouse"" to gather the knowledge required."
24506,Very fun if you are into simcity or city building type games. I recommend modding the game as you can personalize your city to your likings.
24507,"Like other reviewers have said, it's the game you wish SimCity was. Watch ""Our Passion for Cities: Skylines"" on YouTube and you can see the game developers talk about the love they put into it. Compared to SimCity, there's bigger maps, more customization, lots of dlc, mods like crazy, and attractive models and environments. Having played a lot of SimCity (along with older iterations) I have to say Cities: Skylines has a better road tool. If you play these kinds of games you'll know how huge that is. There's a lot to like here. I love that you can create districts and set policies unique to the district. I do wish they'd put out some futuristic dlc, similar to SimCity's Cities of Tomorrow (probably the coolest dlc in a city builder ever). I would give it a 5 and for the current level of tech in this genre, it maybe deserves one. I rate at a 4 though until Cities does something truly revolutionary with the franchise, like letting me mod in-game to my heart's content. Then I'd really be a god."
24508,"Fun city builder. Mass transit is worthwhile DLC. Make sure that you check out mods. Specifically traffic manager: president edition (TM:PE). It makes huge improvments to traffic management. No parking zones, lane arrow control (ie. no left turn), makes the AI spread out across multiple lanes instead of stacking in single file lines, etc."
24509,"Very complex ecosystem made easy to operate and manage, its fun wathing city development and your decisions really have a profound impact on gameplay and growth"
24510,good game m8
24511,Very fun city builder. Not very hard at all but fun to build your city the way you want without worrying too much about planning or other mechanics.
24512,"To anyone who likes city building/planning, this game is well made. The mods available just make it easier for players to design their cities/regions as they like."
24513,"great city builder, chill game"
24514,Great modern city builder
24515,"I hadn't played this game before I spent 10 hours in one go. After that one session, I can say without a doubt this game is better than the competing franchise. I'd definitely recommend this to anyone who wants to really dive into the engineering aspects of building a city, this game let's you do a lot of cool stuff."
24516,"From humble beginnings to becoming the mayor of your very own metropolis, Cities: Skylines offers all of that and more! I highly recommend this game to anybody who is looking for something that time and effort has been put into. From something as small as a bicyclist to something as large as a sky scraper, the detail is unmatched by any other game."
24517,I like to give my citizens very high taxes which makes the game very good
24518,"
Great game and lots of fun
"
24519,one of the best simulation/building strategy game i've ever played! love the workshop too! definitely worth the money!
24520,Fun game to spend loads of hours on!
24521,very fun. If you want better experiences download mods.
24522,This game's like sex- difficult
24523,city
24524,"This is a really fun game but I have a problem with it. Why isn't autosave turned on by default? I don't like that I've played for hours and forgot to save my city because EVERY GAME has an autosave. But this game is really fun especially the sandbox mods that make it so you can make the city of your dreams without having to pay money, personally I'm more of a creator than a player."
24525,"Great game, endless hours of fun."
24526,makes you wanna buss a mf move
24527,"very, Very very hard to play and succseed in normal mode, 
in creative its easy, with unlimited money and stuff
otherwise its nearly impossible to make a really good city last. 
atleast for the 15 hours ive played"
24528,country roads take me home to the place i belong west virginia
24529,"An extremely immersive urban planning experience which realistically simulates how out city works. One of the highlights is its extensive traffic management where even the most well-designed road system may face problems.

Also, I really loved the modding community who takes this game's experience to the next level as well as the shortcoming the vanilla game have. Nevertheless, this feature could not be possible without the integrated mod support by the game itself.

Overall, I really recommend this game to any city-builder lovers.

"
24530,"Ignore the people, fix the traffic!"
24531,infinite hours of fun like just amazing
24532,Great game
24533,"Barely playable without mods. Takes forever to load up.
Way too expensive as main features are hidden behind dlc.
You won't be able to do the roleplay that you can come up with in your head or have seen other people do on the internet without throwing money and mods at the problem. That's the short version.

It's just about what real cities used to look like. Back in the day when everyone got a car to drive around and to everywhere. But only portraits certain parts of the world. Just grids and way too many cars and vehicles. Barely any fun activities for the little simulated people you can see walking around. Everything (buildings, facilities, stations,...) is sqaure or rectengular. You'll need anarchy mods to make something just have a somewhat realistic shape.
Used another mod to make roads feel more natural, to curve them, to have nice paths and so on.
Used one additional mod more to even have car-free zones. 
Used mods to have slow areas, just service vehicle areas, sensible lane layouts, somewhat intelligent pathing, more road types, turning lanes, enable crafting realistic roundabouts.
Used mods to not get traffic jam.
Used mods to have trains go where they should and not have them climb mountains in an unrealistic fashion.
Shaping the land to the needs of a realistic railroad layout takes way too much time and money. There isn't even planning. No little excavating vehicles doing your bidding. You just terraform the map for hours or use a custom one you edited beforehand or download a map fit for trains. You can't even build custom platforms. Neither underground nor overground. No little village train stations. Just one size fits all, unless dlc or, again, mods.
Trains and ships are likely clipping and overlapping, so be prepared to have your immersion broken.

Building an import orietend city is a mess. Building a dam is a joke. You'll easily spend an hour setting it up. There is no nuclear waste. Everything green is dlc.
Houses look the same once you got to know the few models. It really infuriated me after a while.
Every city looks the same if you don't use heaps of mods and additional props/buildings/skins/themes.
The inhabitants don't really have schedules, sensible paths, outside activities, a say in your city, nice models,...
No artsy area of town, no graffiti, no street art, no comedy clubs, no culture anyting. Maybe one cinema, two types of malls? One big arts gallery or generic museum? But there's a dlc if you want to have a festival! And a dlc if you want a nice park! And another dlc if you like environment friendly anything. Or, you know, little or grand fireworks or (a bit bigger) natural disasters.

There are no bars, hotels etc. in the base game. Seasons? Hell no, pay up!
Almost everything quality of life improving is a mod. It's just a joke to me. Yes, you can see wonderful, impressive projects people sank hundreds of hours into.
But you'll need a beast of a PC to get everything running, deep pockets to even pay half the dlc, heaps of mods to make it less of a pain to play.
I sank some hours into it, yes, at minimum double the hours on record, had big plans, never finished a project as I just got bored or frustrated with finding mods to not have to buy more dlc, just to get even close to what I can up with in my head.
Sometimes I've had my fair share of fun, naming everything, spending an hour getting a perfect road layout for just one little pathway. I did an impressive spaghetti junction with seven directions once. That nice little University campus. I'll remember the tiny fishing village and that lonely house atop a lovely hill. And many more little things and projects.
But unfortunately fun was not the usual feeling. It was more like work.
I never liked the progression of unlocking stuff. If you start with a vision of what you want to build you'll just end up building something completely different until you've unlocked the bulidungs and roads necessary. In the meantime a lot of time will pass. If your city is not that profitable you'd have to let the game run for hours, so it's easier to deactive money being an issue. Same with unlocking stuff. Just deactive progression to play around or even be able to come close to a vision in your head. The game won't let you build a community of eco-friendly people from the start. Not the base game at least. You can't imagine fighting climate change or saving the planet. You can't build an European or Asian medium sized city without hours of searching the workshop.
It doesn't even come close to modern city planning. No community spaces. No shops in the same building as living spaces. No swimming, not on the beach and not inside. Not many sports courts. No skateparks. No ice cream shops, no coffee shops, no regional food or restaurants, no people meeting up for a cup of tea. No hunting cabin, deerstand, anything forestry related besides one standard building of a tree farm. Barely any runis, castles, medieval buildings, not even a mill. I could go on.
It's just a game, not a very deep one, and not a simulation for sure. Not even close.

The 8 tiles (area eligible to build in) limit of the base game is a joke. The maps aren't even that big and originally you are just allowed to build in a tiny part of it. You can't even start to build on the edge of the map unless you get or make yourself custom maps. So cutom stuff again. Custom maps, mods, props, buildings, tools, roads. Custom everything. After having paid at least triple the price of an usual game price to get the full experience.
For a game that is no sim, that has no soul, at least imho, few key features without dlc, unacceptable mechanics and a meagre number of assets. A lot of issues are only to be handled with many dlc, mods and additional content. And paid dlc. Then you'll have way too many props and need to look for a search props mod to not loose your mind scrolling through everything that took you hour upon hours to find on the workshop. There are quite many nice mods and things to place, that's the best part of the whole thing. The dedicated modding community and their passion.
For a six year old product, that has the most fun and role-play friendly features that got me excited about it in the first place boarded up behind a paywall of way too many dlc, it's just not worth the time and money for me. It's just meh. Mid would be an overstatement. It's underwhelming and even a bit disappointing. After a while at least. But for short time fun it's just too messy, hard to get your head around and expensive. Then it's easily a time sink, hence likely a money sink if you take the bait. Just this one prop, just this one additional mod. Wait, I need another dlc for this to work properly? Meh."

24539,Spent 8 hours in one sitting.
24540,shitty skylined
24541,it is a very fun game but can take a long time to load on big cities and can be laggy

24553,"The base game can provide hours of game play, but the workshop community is where this game shines.
"
24554,"Easy to pick up, Complicated enough to make interesting.
NEEDS A AUTO BULLDOZING MOD"
24555,i have not realize i been plaing it for six hours
24556,Everything you wanted modern simcity to be + community features and mods
24557,"good game 
"
24558,"Cities Skylines might be the most addictive game you'll play this year, next year or the year after. Opening the game brings you to a user-friendly map selection screen, followed by a well designed interface for actually playing it. As a new player, I can remember being a little daunted at how many icons there are to play with, but the game does a great job of building up the complexity little by little to help you learn the all ins and outs. The aim of the game is very simple - to build a megalopolis city. Getting there, however, can be quite the creative challenge!

The music feels well designed to keep the player's attention focused, swelling and fading in a way that really helps me feel like I've built something to be proud of. The sound effects also are well themed, even if the Chirper (sort of like Twitter for the sims that live in the city) can get annoying. Thankfully, you can turn Chirper's auto-open off... just remember to check it from time to time because this is where sims will alert you to things like water/sewage or electricity shortages before they become major problems!

The base game itself has countless hours of replay value, even without all the many DLCs that Paradox have released. I own many of them, but not all, deciding to tailor my game playing experience to my own interests. This chopping and choosing has not led to any faults in the running of the game at all, but it does occasionally mean I don't have certain public transport systems or road types. First world problems, much. 
In addition to several DLCs, there is a huge modding community here on Steam that have worked tirelessly to produce different kinds of junctions, building assets, and construction tools that really do let you do whatever you want. It's kind of intoxicating, really. 

Basically, if you want a relaxing game to lose yourself in and flex your creativity, this game is for you! There's no combat or major competition with the AI (unless you count controlling crazy lane changing as combat... I wouldn't blame you if you did) and there are some scenarios with certain win conditions if sandbox mode isn't your thing. Cannot recommend this  game enough!

24559,Traffic jams 10 out of 10.
24560,I really enjoy Cities Skylines!
24561,Super fun!
24562,Amazingly entertaining game. I love how this also keeps your mind busy to tackle issues.
24563,verry nice
24564,"The kind of city builder that you want to do one more thing before you sleep, but eventually stay up all night because you-know-why.

Graphics, gameplay, maturrity and moddability *combined* speaking, this is the best citybuilder around.

24565,This IS the best city sim you can buy.

24572,"very addicting, the controls are pretty easy to get use to and overall a great game!"
24573,"paradox go brrr buy dlc - other than that the mods in this game allow you to be extremely creative and create massive cities and or small towns, whatever you want your little abode to be"
24574,"Originally played this game on console, only to find this game is so much better on the PC. The modder, asset and map community make this a truly epic simulator. nothing else gets close to realism like this game does."
24575,About as close as you can get to the perfect city builder.
24576,what sim city should've been
24577,its good
24578,Simply lovely..
24579,Great game depth and detail.  DLCs add a lot and the mod community is great.
24580,Yes
24581,刁民天际不是吹的
24582,"love it
"
24583,"It's fun but I really wish there were more options to create individual buildings as opposed to just zoning for the most part, which encourages really utilitarian designs"
24584,It's a good game when vanilla but a god game when modded. I do give my honest recommendation for this fun game!
24585,nice game
24586,Only reason i play this now is to commit murder on the masses ! enough said
24587,you can eliminate the middle class
24588,Cool
24589,.
24590,one of my favourite games
24591,Went in with the intention of proving to my town planners that they are in fact complete idiots and planning is EzPz. 40 hours later I'm starting to wonder if it's me who is the moron!
24592,"Probably the best city building game to date, fun to play at all ages.
DLC helps spice up the game alot, but you don't really ""need"" it.
The replayability of this game is out of the world though, you never really get bored."
24593,"This game is great, it's incredibly fun creating and destroying."
24594,the amount of DLCs are fucking disguisting
24595,I like the game
24596,There are so many ways to play. You can chill and just let the city grow with the vanilla assets. Add a couple mods to make a great functioning city. Add a couple assets to make a beautiful city. There's something for everyone.
24597,"The game crashes 90% of the time the other 10% it just lags incredibly, but when it is working as it should it's fun don't waste your money on this piece of crap"
24598,nice
24599,"Great game, plenty of fun mods to accompany it. Relaxing, fun, creative. Love watching videos about reducing traffic. Literally the only time when traffic is actually fun."
24600,meh its ok
24601,"Si te gustan los juegos de simulacion y planeacion de ciudades, este juego es increible.
El soporte de la comunidad es enorme, desde carreteras, avenidas hasta mods que modifican la jugabiliad y el aspecto general.
La curva de aprendizaje es muy rapida pero sigue siendo un reto tener una profit y al mismo tiempo tener una ciudad bonita sin mencionar los problemas de trafico que surgiran con forme tu poblacion crezca"
24602,nice
24603,love it
24604,I really enjoy this game because there is so much customization and the themes of building personally I like the NY themes. this game is 1000 Times better with mods.    ;)
24605,i LIKE
24606,very nice
24607,LOVE THIS GAME!!!!!
24608,"So far, I only have one complaint: Traffic. There is no way to mitigate traffic. Road choice / type is extremely limited, getting vehicles off the highway and into your town without a miles of backed up traffic is nearly impossible with the options given to you. Roundabouts only clog, overpasses require a city-area teardown to build - the traffic is a real problem and the only thing preventing me from actually enjoying the game."
24609,"Great game, i always come back to it bc it's a perfect game"
24610,"I was skeptical of upgrading from SC4, but I have to say I am definitely surprised and pleased! I love the nuanced functionality of some of the feature, especially in transportation. The road options do need some refinement, but I guess thats what the mods are for. overall I approve of this!"
24611,I love this game.
24612,"Game doesn't work with Citrix installed.  They claim the workaround is to reinstall without a specific component.  Fix is in main unity engine but not in Cities Skylines, even after many years of known issue."
24613,big smart make jizz
24614,Lost my irl job but its fine cuz my citizens haven't
24615,"Game allows you to play it multiple ways for different goals that you set for yourself. Most of the micro-management details are handled by the game, unless you want to control various industries. Basically you are just giving direction to the towns growth to cause it to grow, causing traffic jams to see if you can figure out how to solve it.
Lots of variety and DLCs as well as MODs to assist you in areas you don't want to manage."
24616,Great game
24617,IT GOOD

24621,"crashes 
when there are mods installed        PLEASE fix the crashing"
24622,Love creating cities and destroying them it makes me happy
24623,"I mean its a game were you build and manage a citie, what are you supposed to say?"
24624,Mods for this game are great.
24625,"I only have the base game which is dull and devoid of any challenge.  I could get all of the DLC but that would set me back around £150,  no game is worth that.  If its supposed to be part of the game, and if I have to get the DLC just so I can enjoy it then make it free, because as it is this game is nothing more than a glorified demo version."
24626,Fun game if its your thing.  Mods are your friend.
24627,I like building big cities then killing everyone in there with natural disasters
24628,"I mean if you really like rts/city builders go for it; it can be relaxing and creative and you'll definitely have some hurdles to jump over but it's certainly worth it. However, this game without mods can be grueling and not fun at times. For instance, around the 10k pop limit,in my experience, you would usually have a decent or simple highway/road system. However the ai's inept ability to actually function and go in separate lanes and actually function on roads are frustrating at least. There are ways to get over this in vanilla but for most it's not worth it for most as it's just too much management. There are some other reasons but overall I don't recommend the game lol"
24629,love this game made more hours than steam says cus of overlay the city boulding is imersive you invest alot in small people and actualy feel like a city planner planing ahaid to make your city the best and largest
24630,fun but buggie
24631,"It's really, really good. In the city builder genre, this is IT.

However, the vast majority of my playtime is with a certain list of mods that I now cannot play without. Mods that add some much needed functionality over an incredibly lively and intuitive building game. 

The mechanics of building are easy to grasp and the game looks good, but what really sells Skylines for me is how organic it feels.

When any person (Cim) in your city leaves their house, they have a set destination that they want to go to, and they will use what you give them - roads, paths and various forms of public transport - to get there. This results in a very realistic traffic simulation (well, without criminal driving and crashes anyway) where traffic problems require well-thought out solutions for that particular problem. There are general rules of city building like road hierarchy that will always benefit you, but there are no absolute good or bad ways to build your city. I've fixed a congested intersection by simply moving commercial services to the other side of the road - I didn't touch the road itself at all nor did I build another, I just removed some need to cross that intersection. And that, for some reason, feels amazing to me.

The city and it's people respond to what you do. I've got countless kicks from building footpaths and seeing Cims start using it immediately. That's when you know what you did was a good optimization.

And that's what the hook of this game boils down to - growth and optimization. You cannot ""lose"" the game per say. Sure, you can lose lots of money if you build strange inefficient things, but there is no looming threat of a big ugly game over. You're left in relative peace with your own machinations. Let the primal human ambition reign supreme: Build! Grow! Optimize!

THAT BEING SAID, beware of the pricey Paradox DLC model. If you want all the cool features, be prepared to dish out lots of money. Wait for sales and pick the ones you really want carefully."
24632,Great game - really hoping any sequel has better mixed use options for both zoning and buildings.
24633,its ok to kill time if you like simulation games like me :)
24634,"The vanilla version of the game is pointless. After you have spent time making the game more realistic via third party mods and assets the game crashes. Do not bother, this game defaults to being a total waste of time and money."
24635,"You dont know what true pain is until you play 6 hours straight and autosave turned it self off and your game crashes and you lost all your progress.

10/10 I recommend."
24636,"If you're sick of your governmental system, why not become your own mayor? It's a nice game that you can design your city with realistic gameplay. However it requires a strong PC for smooth gaming."
24637,good game
24638,Your the mayor.
24639,"Great game. DLC pretty much a must: Parklife, Industries, Mass Transit, and Sunset Harbor specifically. You'll probably need 12-16 MB RAM to play without chugging. But this is the best city sim out there to date. Enjoy."
24640,Dude its gnikcuf awesome!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
24641,.
24642,"It very fun to play.

24643,"Without a doubt my favorite city building game. 

-incredible amount of content
-Solid Difficulty
-Huge list of achievements to strive for
-Gigantic workshop presence. 
-Nice Graphics
-Extensive editing ability.
-Several ""save the city"" type scenarios.
-A DLC option for almost everything.

I highly recommend this game if you enjoy city management games, or city building games."
24644,Extremely laggy
24645,What can I say?  Great game!
24646,City life
24647,It's chill
24648,difficult at first but now easier and more fun.
24649,"way better than Sim City (3,4, any of them."
24650,Good
24651,Good game.....   :)
24652,"Very fun game. I grew up playing games like rollercoaster tycoon, zoo tycoon, and The Sims, all from cereal boxes. Simulation games are in my blood. I've wanted to play this game for years but only got it recently when I built my first computer. Let me tell you, it did not disappoint. It took a bit to get used to the controls as there are many mechanics and things you need to watch, but it's incredibly enjoyable, and the learning curve contributes to that. 
If you get this game and have a computer to support it, I highly recommend looking into mods and assets on the workshop. I've found that they've seriously increased my enjoyment now that I use them as some pesky mechanisms can be worked around (such as using the move-it mod)."
24653,"Do you have RAM? Great now you can play I think
Great game"
24654,Gives you lots of room for creativity in a really fun sandbox environment.
24655,This game will take over your entire life

24663,It is very fun
24664,"this is the absolute best city builder ever and i stand by that. the effort and design that has been put into this game is amazing and its so fun to see it grow from a small village to a huge metropolis. if you want to get the best experience out of this game i would recommend downloading a few mods, these being the traffic mod, the roundabout builder mod and the better fps mod for low - medium range pc's."
24665,"The tiny Ui text scale made this unplayable for me, even the mods which attempt to fix this create other problems such as overlapping. It's a pity because I enjoyed the console version which doesn't have this problem. If you're playing a couple of feet away from your screen you wont have this problem."

24672,"Cities Skylines is the best ever city simulator of decade, that improved all of we have be seen on all SimCity series. This game is amazing, I buyed all the DLCs and worth it, a lot of content that can bring fun to hours and hours, congrats Paradox amazing work, that game is a unique and best ever experience on build cities."
24673,fun but grind
24674,Great game!
24675,Amazing!
24676,Definitely play this game but don't overload it with mods and assets which is very easy to do and will make your game VERY unstable. Use only the essentials and then gradually add more when you get better at the game
24677,YESH
24678,Game won't begin town/city? What should I do?
24679,Only 1100 hours in. I'll make up my mind in a few more.
24680,Very fun and entertaining. wish the buildings were higher though
24681,Great game!!
24682,"very good game. can keep you busy for a week or so.

8 / 10"
24683,"The game itself is great, but now that Paradox decided to include their own launcher and collect your data to share it with their affiliates, the game is turning into spyware. Also, even if you are OK with that, the game does not launch.

To all companies out there, stop ruining things.

Buy only after Paradox returns from their abysmal mistake. Otherwise, there are other games to play."
24684,What happens when you give absolute power to the Planning Dept? >:)
24685,"This is an insanely fun and addictive version of Sim City that very much goes back to basics and lets you build a detailed world. It is very challenging when limited finances are available. And the initial learning curve requires a little you tube tutorials before comfortable play can be achieved. But once those hurdles are overcome, the payoff is worth it many times over. The expansion packs are vital in a few cases."
24686,yep it is better than sim city 4
24687,nice city builder
24688,"An amazing City Building Simulator with a lot of different options to customize your own city how you want it. Even without mods there are a lot of different things to do, but I highly recommend getting mods to really make things as you desire."
24689,Better than SimCity.
24690,Floods.
24691,I have been playing this game for atleast 5 years. This is the best city builder game by a mile.
24692,8
24693,"Just play it and enjoy, this game is everything you could want in a city builder with endless DLC. DO IT!"
24694,"is fun yes. worth full price. is often on sale tho, so is worth waiting. if you like game, research the dlc, and buy those you like. really dont need all."
24695,Heavy Traffic and rapid death simulator
24696,Love this game and would recommend it to anyone. Only thing I'd change is that it would be beyond amazing if you could invite a friend to build a city with you (maybe to have a group of friends handle different areas of city managing) :)
24697,"I've had this game a while but never really played it much. It's quite daunting at first and the temptation to fill the space with housing and retail is quite high. However after deciding to get the mass transit DLC and give this game a real go, I am glad I did. It's very in depth and a lot you need to do, and I kept thinking about it after I'd stopped playing it which is a good sign! 

I really do recommend it, but be prepared to sit down and put a lot of thought into how you go about things early on. I have started and restarted many times and still getting the hang of it."
24698,ya
24699,"A great game with alot to do and you can make very big city's, and a very high amount of mods to make it even beter, but when you hit around 80 thousand people the game fps  becomes very low so just take that in to awareness."
24700,Super cool game.
24701,Needs more traffic... 0.5 buses out of 10 garbage trucks.
24702,its awsome to play
24703,Fun game with no end in sight.
24704,This Game IS THE BEST CITY BUILDING GAME ON STEAM. no take it back IN THE WHOLE WIDE WORLD! ITS SO REALISTIC (besides the speed of building and the flying thing) THE MY DAD IS A BUILDER AND HE SAY ITS REALLISTIC!!! THE BEST SIMALATOR FOR BUILDING CITIES
24705,genuine distracting fun
24706,"It can be a fun city builder ... until you realize that all DLC achievements in this game count toward your Steam average even if you don't own the DLC ... which they want around $100+ more for. It's pretty friggin' insane.

If you don't care about Steam achievements then I suppose you have nothing to worry about, although, I think it should be recognized just how slimy Paradox is being with that system. I seriously cannot believe people are cool with it. It's very anti-consumer.

You also need a separate Paradox user account to play which I think is annoying."
24707,poop
24708,As a child I drew maps all the time. That led me to find Sim city. New sim city sucked. Cities: Skylines filled that void. Now I can't stop. Please help me.
24709,"Addictive Gameplay...,"
24710,I should’t buy this game...I spent too much time to play it.:(
24711,Good
24712,Reminds me of the good old sim cities days years and years ago! Finally something i can reflect towards that game!
24713,my city has over 50 graveyards
24714,This is the city builder I've been looking for.  Sim City 2013 was an utter joke and this game really has filled that void.  SimCity 4 was one of the best and lots of us city builder fans were waiting for a successor to that.  This is that game.
24715,"Cities Skylines is an excellent mod making platform that comes with a free citybuilder game.

More seriously though, this game comes alive with mods, and among the first things you do in it should be to check out the most popular and most subscribed mods in the workshop. They are way more important than the developer's own dlc, and they are free.

Remember, buying Cities Skylines for a few bucks and trying it without mods to see if you like it is like judging a book by its cover only, you can't even scratch the surface.

24716,"It is the best city building game, just if you have a poor performing computer don't buy it. I have a high-end and it sometimes randomly gets lag spikes. That may only be because my city is huge."
24717,Addictive.  Cool mod community
24718,good shit
24719,"I was a huge SimCity Fan from the start.  That is until like all games EA buys they ruined it.  Cities Skylines is excellent and they support Workshop so there are tons of Mods available, which essentials like Movit and TMP traffic manager, which IMO both need to be included in the base game.  Good DLC's ""except"" for Natural Disaster, not a fan of it at all.  Anyway I just can't get enough of the game.  I'm looking forward to a followup since the game is a few years old.  That and another kudo for having Mac Support, runs well on my MacBook Pro."
24720,
24721,Really fun and works pretty well on Low-end pcs
24722,it good yes good it yeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeet good game lol gg

24737,"fuck you cities skyline your game is shit the  112,944 are  bots there not real dont believe them this game is shit  dont buy dlcs"
24738,"Very cool yes
"
24739,Very good!
24740,Great Game
24741,wish my local gov was as effective as this game for city planning
24742,its fun but the core game definitely feels like its missing things that are in the dlc. its better than sim city but it would be great if the dlc wasnt so overpriced.
24743,"it is an excelent game, civil engineers and architects would love this"
24744,hamster
24745,dsawdsadwa
24746,Very sutisfiyng. My OCD thanks you!!!
24747,"Out of all the 'City Building' games available, this just tops ALL of them in terms of gameplay. 10/10
The community workshop is full of mods, assets and gameplay enhancing things! 10/10
The devs really seem to support this game with constant expansions 10/10

Stop reading the reviews, just buy the damn game!!!!

(The engine of the game seems a bit outdated and the game can get choppy with larger cities and plenty of mods, but still, by far the best city builder available)"
24748,"spent hundreds of millions of hours on this game, its ok."
24749,"To begin with, this game is a masterpiece. Before I bought this game, i had only played the free version of simcity. And when i got this game and played it, i played it 4 hours in a row. Every person that likes city building games, should buy this. You can't wish better than this. 
This was also my second game.


Pros: Very realistic
         You can play this almost infinitly
         There are a lot of mods
         The price is perfect
         The DLC's are very high quality
Cons: There are too many DLC's
          DLC's are expensive
          The game is very CPU and GPU heavy 


Overall, i recommend this game to anyone wanting to buy it."
24750,"My poor FX 6300 can't handle this for sure :( Trust me my city just hit 300.000 and my HD 7870's usage can't pass 20% anymore when my poor FX monster on 97%. I am playing at LOWEST settings with also 50% resolution scale but it doesn't matter. 10 FPS forever. Despite all of that, this one is really one of my bests. I am really enjoying it with 10 FPS. Great community, great workshop, great game. Play it pixellated and take some screenshots with high settings. Thats how it works ;)

Edit: Oh, I saw just now that my system is in recommended requirements. What a shame :))"
24751,Very good game modding is super easy
24752,fune
24753,"Hello, I like this game"
24754,Cities: Skyline is one of the best modern city-builder games right now. Its support to the modder community will bring us great joys.
24755,vewy noice game
24756,Great game kind of loose track of time when you're playing this game. One thing I should mention is be careful of mixing certain mods together I have had it corrupt map files before.
24757,depriving humans of their basic rights
24758,Great
24759,good fun and simple to play but can get very in depth unlike this review
24760,Good replacement for those tired of Sim City 4.
24761,Its amazing!!!!!!!!!
24762,The traffic will make you want to jump off a cliff.
24763,"After having played this game, deleted it, played it some more, and deleted it again I have to say that though I had fun I cannot recommend this game. 

As others have stated the DLC is out of control. If you don't get the DLC on a sale they want an insane amount of money - over $100! I understand some DLC can add to a game, but when features of the game are purposefully taken out or left out to sell DLC that's predatory and anti-consumer. Once your city gets decently large you start to notice the lack of features to keep the game interesting and engaging.

Another thing that got my attention recently is the launcher. Why would this game need a launcher? Turns out the EULA requires you to consent to them using your information for marketing and other corporate speak that means they're making mine off of you while you're paying a game you paid them for!

I have to say that this game could be better than it is. It is anti-consumer, greed-driven, and lacking overall."
24764,"No sleep No sleep No sleep No sleep No sleep No sleep No sleep No sleep 
absolutely amazing game!"
24765,Great game  Always find myself coming back
24766,Very addictive after about an hour or so of playtime.
24767,"i literally bought a 2100 dollar desktop for this game. started on ps4 and had all of the DLCs. got thisa and splurged anad bought all the DLCs AGAIN. i do wish paradox would respect the fact you bought the DLCs on another platform and it ewould transfer but this game is worth iht
"
24768,"Yeah it's good. If you think you might like it you probably will. You will need at least 8,000 mods, but that's what the Workshop is for"
24769,"probably my favourite game right now, i love building cities and i would definitely reccomend"
24770,This game is honestly amazing. even without all the dlc's there's still so much you can do. all tho I wish they would do alot more optimizing because I have 16 gb of ram and 4 gb of vram and this game easily eats it all up and causes lag. but other then that this game is amazing!
24771,it great game
24772,"This game may take all of your spare hours and turn them into digital towns...

I'm over a thousand hours in now, and see no end in sight, so I guess its an okay title.

Warning: getting the first couple mods that are kind of necessary to quality of life may seem innocuous, but this is a gateway into addiction..."
24773,"So many things to do. get creative. It's a challenging game that I think is mostly enjoyed by people 12+
Definitely try out some mods :)"
24774,"I really like the RPG quality of this game. Meaning that you don't have to go build a huge city if you want. You can stay small.. building something more interesting than trying to ""beat the game""

My kids and I love renaming everything.. lots of fun."
24775,"A rich and diverse citybuilding game with a lot of content and a heavy amount of polish to the final product.
As many have said before, and will continue to say again again (rightly so, might I add), this game is the spiritual successor to just about any citybuilding game that came before it, before every developer seemed to have collectively decided to give less content for more money and export 90% of your remaining game into online servers.

This game is whatever you make of it, and with the rich amount of mods you'll be able to tune it to what you're looking for as long as you're willing to wade through 25% broken-with-updates mods and 55% low quality iconless building edits to get at the actually decent 20% of good mods and new buildings/structures.
If you're not willing to sit down and dedicate the time to do that, then citybuilding games probably aren't for you to begin with, as you'll be dedicating a lot of time to fine-tuning your city and optimising traffic systems, figuring out how best to lay your services down, setting up public transit systems, etc etc.

Setting up your city efficiently will take some time and some failed tries to get a proper feel for, but here's some tips to keep you oriented :
- Make sure every third building is a burial ground
- Replace every intersecting road with a roundabout everywhere no matter how small or inconsequential
- Make sure your industries are all on an island and that their pollution doesn't reach across the river/sea
- Make sure you keep in mind that when your city expands, just about everyone who moves in is the same age, so they'll die from old age at about the same times, creating massive waves of death that can make everyone else move out, so you'll need to make sure that your hearses can make 3 loops around the city to pick up a single corpse in a very small amount of time, as their AI seems to be paid for travel distance, not for efficiency.
- Make sure that when people start moving out from death waves you don't bulldoze key parts of your infrastructure, every building has a small radius for connecting to power grids, so if you break down a few buildings that were connecting the rest of your city to your power stations then you'll accidentally plunge your remaining city into a blackout where everyone'll leave within a week.
- Keep an eye on your garbage trucks, because if they stall for even a minute then your city'll be filled to the brim with garbage, causing everyone to leave or die, thus causing more leaving and dying, thus destroying your economy.
- Find a mod to disable Chirper(the ingame version of twitter, along with the same vapid, millennial vibes as the actual twitter) pretty much as soon as you buy the game. 

As you may have guessed by these, this game has a few issues when it comes to pick-up services. Corpses and garbage will be what the majority of your time is spent overseeing, and there's not all that many mods designed to resolve these without entirely disabling the mechanics themselves. Your traffic will have to flow near-perfectly in order to prevent massive buildups of things that'll lead to the total collapse of your city in the later stages of the game, but unfortunately unless you've intentionally planned out how your traffic will flow ahead of time, then you'll have to suffer the economic loss of tearing down buildings to correct your roads and hope that they'll rebuild in enough time to cover the damages.

Traffic AI is all well and good when you're running things in a smaller city, and it's actually a somewhat viable strategy to break your city down into sub-cities with their own self-contained infrastructure and services, but after you hit a particular point you're going to be choking on the AI's dumb choices when it comes to traffic, like only occupying a single lane down a 6 lane 1-way road and causing a buildup for miles back, paralysing the rest of your traffic system and congesting everything simply because they can't stack into different lanes.

For the traffic issue itself, there's a few mods that allow for more intelligent handling of traffic on the AI's end, as well as some giving you tools to better manage how it works on your end, too. I seriously recommend looking into them if you plan on keeping your cities for longer than a few hours each and don't plan on taking the three month long introductory course on methodically calculating every intersection's impact on traffic flow and how roundabouts are objectively the answer to all the world's problems(when the game's buildings are designed to fit into neat squares). 

As for chirper : find a mod to turn it off unless you're one of those weird people who actually finds it thrilling when you're waiting on an important message to come through and you hear the ping for it, check it, and find that it's only spam and not the really important life-altering message you've been waiting for for the past 30 minutes. 
In my opinion there's not a single better way to remove the joy from planning out your city when a twitter mob fills your important-things-i-need-to-handle-right-now-otherwise-my-city-could-fail notification inbox with either literally-substanceless critiques(randomly generated personal opinions with no gameplay impact) or '#thanks #mayor for #doing the #INSERT-LITERALLY-ANY-POLICY, LACK-OF-POLICY, BUILDING, LACK-OF-BUILDING, WEATHERCONDITION, LACK-OF-WEATHERCONDITION-HERE 6 #weeks ago, I'm going to #remind you about it every #three ingame #hours'
primarily because that inbox is mainly designed to draw your attention to serious issues in the city that need resolving (mostly corpses or trash), so whenever you get a ping and open it to read it, you think 'oh god what did I overlook this time?' and 90% of the time you'll be met with: 
'I #really enjoyed my #vacation in this #city' 
'#recycling is #thefuture #greenenergy #environment #solarpower' 
'I don't #like that the #mayor enacted this #policy that #half of the #community #likes' 
etc etc, but you'll never be able to dismiss it mentally because there's always the 10% chance that it points you to a raging fire that's consuming your industrial sector and threatens to light your oil processing district up in a blaze of short lived, very expensive glory.
Thus, in my honest opinion, disable it and focus on finding problems the good ol' fashioned way, or find a mod that disables all of the non-problem 'chirps' so you can be sure that when the biggest icon on the screen at any time(the big blue bird at the top centre of your screen) shouts at you, it's not about someone liking the fact that you built an ice cream shop 70 years ago for the 30th time this month.
-and remember, the above only applies if you don't own more than your body weight in ADD medication, or for some reason would enjoy a game mechanic like this.

All in all I can recommend getting the game if you enjoy games about building cities, or giving it a look if you enjoy games like the Sims or other similar personally-oriented building games like that.
It's got a unique blend of casual and miro-management elements that make it so you don't have to be super strict in how you play as long as you're not drowning in oceans of debt, garbage and corpses, but still demanding enough to keep you awake and invested in the game and building your city intelligently.

8/10 please spam my inbox with corpses and garbage again!"
24776,Absaloutly Amazing city builder well worth getting
24777,"Such a great game. Even if you play 'vanilla', you can have so much fun  with it. And workshop brings a huge amount of free stuff to add to your game/city to make it even prettier/more functional/more you. Just have fun with it!"

24780,good game
24781,"Awesome game, you can go deep in this game, focus on the parts you like, ignore the parts you don't like. Except traffic. You can't avoid traffic. But learning how to properly manage traffic is kinda cool
"
24782,"The game itself is fun, but get boring after a while, with most of the fun coming from workshop mods or insanely priced DLC. Most of the DLC should be free."
24783,i have severe depression 👍
24784,yes
24785,"i promise you, you wont regret it"
24786,"Very nice city simulation. I especially like the vehicle traffic...

BUT!
The DLC scheme is so appalling that I simply can't in any serious mind recommend this product. It just silly to expect your customers to pay for every single basic feature and such huge prices. Maybe if these DLCs were priced closer to their actual worth and desirability I might recommend but right now there is no way I would support this behavior.

Although, the ~200 bucks price tag for full game is pretty funny since many consider 70 excessive. Just hold my beer, right?"
24787,one of the best city builder game
24788,The absolute best city building simulator around. They took everything wrong with the SimCity franchise and improved upon it. My brain can't wrap around how in-depth this simulator gets. It will take over your life in a good way.
24789,It's good.
24790,Fun and beautiful game that allows you to have more creative control over your city than other city building games.
24791,"This is a pretty immersive game, can get lost in it for hours.  If you like the solo, creativity sort of game play, check it out."
24792,good
24793,"Iv'e put many hours and different city builds into this game on two different platforms, and I'm still coming back. Having mods makes it that much better. Would definitely recommend to anyone who enjoys tycoon style games."
24794,"This game gives me help in depression and overall panic attacks where i would build my city and relax and try to take my mind off the world, it hurts to say this but we dont have time in the world we get back but i enjoy every time i play this game and helps me through the suffering and pain i have been through recently, thanks to the developers for peace"
24795,"very swag, encountered many bonks."
24796,şükürler olsun bugün de başkanım
24797,"Very complicated and took me some research to understand how to start, but that makes for really rich and complex game play. It is creative and interesting but can also be frustrating because you're keeping track of so many factors at a time. A nice challenge for the mind if you're up for a learning curve."
24798,taxes
24799,"Simply the best city builder of the modern era, an absolute must have if you're a fan of the genre.  The DLC is priced extremely well for the value and the continued development of the game extends it's playability almost infinitely.  Very active and fun modding community and lots of great mods to explore.  10/10!"
24800,"I can't even load the game anymore, but apart from that, great game with some good mods and a great community."
24801,"The most addictive game I've played in years!
A library of add-ons and MODs to last you a lifetime!"
24802,Its a very good game it can even be played on a macbook which is very suprising enough but its so much better then simcity it has no dissapointments other than DLC prices 😂 but overall its a really good game do buy it
24803,yes
24804,"Before you purchase you should know the game uses it's own launcher, and going along with that, you must agree to their 3rd party agreements. Cities Skylines, is a decent game, not the worst, but definitely not the best. It feels pretty bare bone after you reach late game with the high density buildings, and really the beginning is when you'll likely have the most fun. And unfortunately, it's one of the games that release DLC that should've just been in the game already. With a couple exceptions, I.E. maps, and the disasters DLC. And they charge hundreds if you decide to buy them without a sale, or from a 3rd party. Wait till it has at least a 60% sale, or get it from one of the cheap game selling websites."
24805,Its everything I wanted out of Sim city.
24806,Best City Building game to date. Calmes the nerves and educates people about infrastructure and zoning.
24807,"Would like more detailed control over things, you're quite out of hand, things happening without you being able to control, but overall is very interesting."
24808,"awesome city building game, would recommend to any power hungry person who wants to cause mayhem in a city."
24809,Very comfy city builder
24810,Best city building game in my opinion.
24811,good
24812,Its like managing your traffic simulator
24813,Amazing game!
24814,Highly recommended - fun for years.
24815,The best city planning game on Steam
24816,
24817,incredible Game!
24818,"Great game. It's wonderful to see how your city grows from small town to a megapolis. There are lot of small details to not get bored and you can zoom in to watch the citizens and their lives.
Absolutely recommend."
24819,it is fun
24820,Really fun and enjoyable
24821,it good
24822,I love this game. I hope that they continue to develop more DLC or a sequel. If you like sim games this is a great one.
24823,"great game, lots of fun"
24824,"I was looking for the next thing to try after playing Sim City as a kid. This game is so much better. It's complete, comprehensive. Love it. Worth the cost."
24825,Great game!!! Piolarda
24826,More challenging and dynamic than Sim City. All around a great city building game. I was given this copy of Cities: Skylines as a gift.
24827,"I am 8 years old when I play Cities - not 62 years old as it says on my birth certificate... ;-)
"
24828,it fun
24829,cool
24830,my favorite part of this game is how the city evolves over time.  This game is hella addicting.
24831,it is very fun to make city
24832,"great game 9/10 just wish it was cheaper
"
24833,I love it
24834,better than sex
24835,Endless possibilities.
24836,"It's like Sim City. If Sim City was complex yet simplistic, visually stunning, and satisfying to sink hours of your life into."
24837,Pretty nice overall
24838,"A great platform to be creative and inspired. The gameplay is pretty awesome and I enjoy these genres. It just feels good to have an endless supply of resources and build as much as you want. And, then just as rewarding to have no resources but yet still share the land, water, and air with all subjects. enjoi"
24839,"The game did a bad job at describing the game play to me. You make roads and zones then the game plays itself, I'm looking for a little more control on how the city looks. Then the tutorial, or more like non-tutorial was terrible. I figured all I need in a tutorial is tell me where the stuff I need to get started is located and how it works, how to work the cameras (since there's no standard) and I'll figure out the rest. I only played for an hour because unlike most of the games I buy if I don't like it I'm only losing a few bucks but losing $30 just would not fly in my book. I would say games of that cost should have a demo even if it's just the tutorial that is in the demo. The time Steam gives you before you can refund is not enough time to see if you like the game."
24840,">Be me
>Have 500+ hours
>Never finish a single city

EDIT: 696 hours of playing and I finally finished the first city that I'm happy with!"
24841,fire game bro
24842,"better than sim city, but lots of dlc."
24843,This is by far the best city building game out there superseding other city builders like Sim City. There is a learning curve and requires you to get creative to solve problems arising in your city. Getting the DLC isn't a must since there is so much on the workshop brought by the amazing community. I would however highly recommend getting the DLC whenever they're on sale.
24844,Cool game much wow
24845,"I only have the game without add ons, but I spend 1-2 hours every evening and tweeking my city to some nice soundtrack and just create whatever comes in mind. When it comes to this type of games Im not up for any disasters or challanges but simply relax."
24846,if u were ever a sim city child this is for u!!!!!!!
24847,"very cash money game

oh btw you should recreate 1 mile island, thats what I did"
24848, I like this game but there's too much content locked behind dlc for me to recommend this game
24849,"Relly good game, and the best part is that with steam you can easily add mods to the game without external downloads"
24850,"This game is very good at giving you a chalenge when playing with limited money, and can allow you to build an entire nation in infinite money and everything unlocked. I recommend this a lot."
24851,great game

24860,good game
24861,"A strangely addictive, both deep and simple citybuilder."
24862,"So I played 1000 hours, I guess its time for a rating... 

Highly addictive and with it's expansions became what Simcity could have been if they listened to what players wanted. Having the workshop and the ability to create and share content with other players is awesome. I have every expansion save for 2 content creator packs. The best expansions for me were Mass Transit and Industries. The others are all good, but I think the game needs these two. 

Big ups to the community of creators for their part in making this game what it is."
24863,"Fun game, good progression system and very relaxing"
24864,interesting
24865,"Very detailed game, fun and entertaining to play"
24866,This has been my go-to ever since SimCity jumped the shark.
24867,"Played it on PC and on PS4, very much like. Skyscrapers go woooo into the sky."
24868,"Excelent graphics and gameplay, with the workshop assets the possibilities are endless, is very relaxing and you can spend hours creating new things and watching your city gorw, or solving problems that arise from a big city, the challenge is enough to get you engaged and the gameplay is easy enough to be fun even after years of playing."
24869,"I liked it

24872,"I really enjoy this game, there are very few bugs (the only bugs I noticed were some visual bugs with vehicles clipping through buildings and other vehicles). The only thing I dislike is that there are so many features that are locked behind paywalls. If you are looking for a city building game, I recommend Cities: Skylines because it doesn't have the issues that SimCity 2013 has."
24873,"The game is really fun especially when you play with mods, the base game offers many different options and features to build and run your own city, and even recreate your hometown. Another amazing part of this game is the workshop, you want 81 tiles instead of 9? workshop. You want better looking vehicles or roads? workshop. You want a shader to make you game look more real? workshop. Its awesome to see the thousands of mods and assets made by the community that have potential to change the entire game. The only thing I'm not to pleased with is the launcher. Its only made to advertise other games and half the time it doesn't even work. But other than that the game is really enjoyable."
24874,great relaxing game. Suprisingly it makes you think quite a bit the further you get in it
24875,I love this game and having the workshop just adds a whole new element to the game that I love.

24882,"Genuinely hit or miss as to whether it actually loads the game. I have a fairly decent computer that has handled everything I've ever played, including GTA V, but this game barely runs at all."
24883,"im  like this game,"
24884,"Clunky, heavy, slow, infinite loading screens, too much DLC's, boring thrash management, bad road/public transport/pedestrians (traffic) management. Not much. I prefer Sim city 2000 seriously."
24885,This game is very fun. I like this game. You might like it too.
24886,This game is simply the best city management game out there.
24887,"Nice, relaxing, city building game 👍It's published by Paradox though who are notorious for giving you half a game to begin with, then bringing loads of paid dlc out later. Get it on sale."

24894,i loved Sim City back in the day. This one is awesome as well. Having a Blast Building Cities.
24895,i like the game. but the loading takes so fucking long if you're not using a ssd
24896,"I curse the day i bought this game. This game will essentially kill any social life you had, strain your family ties and provide endless hours of nitpicking fun trying to solve the traffic jams. Play at your own risk."
24897,best simulation game ever.
24898,Nothing brings me more joy than a traffic free city.
24899,I like how moddable this game is and it is the best city building game. It is also very easy for beginners.
24900,I was a Sim City person until I tried this game. it is an excellent game and I highly recommend it
24901,A very good one
24902,Easily the best city sim game created.  Community mod content keeps the game interesting.
24903,"Honestly a wonderful city building experience.  Allows you to really sit back and relax, while building a masterpiece."
24904,The best city simulator out there hands down!
24905,"monke city. no taxes, no people. only monke."
24906,.
24907,Great game
24908,"brilliant game just sucks most of it is hidden behind DLCs

update: after getting some dlc. good game"
24909,cool game
24910,"You are in charge of creating a city, but it's not like some other city builders. Except for some resources and special buildings, you just zone where you want different types of buildings and citizens will build in the designated zones as they need more buildings.

The gameplay is mostly watching some stats along the bottom of the screen and reacting to them when they go up or down. This can be a downside for some, but I was fine with it. The only other downside is that it is easy for things to spiral out of control. If you make a bad move, your city can completely lose momentum and it can be hard to recover.

Overall, I really like the game and give it a 4/5."
24911,fun
24912,For those that want that original SimCity vibe.
24913,I love this game.
24914,"It's rather relaxing, and it's less troublesome than some other city building games i've played."
24915,10/10 addictive
24916,"Yes, Cities Skylines is a game that you want to play again and again, BUT you will need a LOT of RAM in order to play smooth. I have a Ryzen 5 2600, DDR4 8gb of ram , and a 1650 gpu. The game used to play smooth, but after the latest update, the amount of ram you need is way more than 8gb. There is a huge workshop behind the game that actually make the game even better. but sometimes, the workshop assets are too much, making the game laggy( sometimes) . Bear in mind of that, crank up some fresh RAMs and make the city of your dreams"
24917,melhor jogo de criação de cidades
24918,the community keeps this game interesting and so happy the creators let them unlike console games.  mi will keep coming back because of it
24919,"Excellent, relaxing city builder. You can adjust the stress of your city at will with a Natural Disaster frequency setting. Watching your city and it's industry evolve with the space available is a fun challenge. Great Game and Great Price!"
24920,"If you love city building games, the name is already there, very straight forward. If you're perfectionist, meticulous, what i can say is you can stuck in this game for hours still find joy."
24921,"Best city builder on the market as far as I know.
Initially, handling traffic can be very challenging, however I've found Biffa on youtube provides excellent advice."
24922,It's fun to kill thousands at a time
24923,would foking recomend
24924,"no other game has kept me interested and engaged consistently for over 4 years. Sometimes I play more than other times but I always come back. One thing I must say is personally I would not enjoy this game nearly as much without mods. 

10/10 Best city simulator by far and probably my favorite game of all time."
24925,I recommend this wonderful game.
24926,"I keep coming back to this game every once in a while and it's always great fun to play it. I am not a fan of the DLC being this expensive, tho."
24927,Yes very good please get if you have creativite and love to city plan.
24928,"Probably the best city builder i have ever played. All thumbs up and props to the modding community, great work there !!"
24929,Really fun city builder with great mod support.
24930,classic
24931,kind fun hard if you haven't played before
24932,yes

24934,nice!
24935,I played Simcity for many years then I saw somebody playing this game on youtube.  I had to get it.
24936,"Definitely the best city building/management game. 
It is what we all dreamed of Sim City - a sim city with way more option of customization, planning and development."
24937,Love this game and one day ill actully get a city
24938,"Very relaxing and creative game i aprove it

24941,"There is no another game were you would build your city, watch it grow, feel chill and relaxed and then everything starts going down and you don't know what to do and problems just keeps appearing. And then you start again, because all this journey to failure was awesome. Until you win and it becomes a bit boring. Then it's time to deleted and reinstall after 6 months."
24942,big meaty sky scraiers
24943,"One of my favourite games....     :D
It's really addictive, because the game just has no ending, and you can keep optimizing forever.
So in terms of playtime you get for your money, this game is probably one of the best on steam..
I can really recommend it."
24944,good game
24945,A good game that i always find myself coming back to over and over
24946,much buildy
24947,Amazing
24948,"TL;DR: I put that I recommend this game, but I really just recommend this game if you get it on sale. Read the entire review if you want to hear the full story.


Pros- 

•Great simulation as far as demand for different zones, economics, etc.

•Graphics for this game are actually pretty impressive considering the release date for this game. In my opinion, the 
 graphics can still look very good even when considering modern games.

•Runs pretty decently on most hardware if you are not building ridiculously large or complex cities.

•Awesome water physics: playing around with the water physics is fun.

•Some of the DLCs add some pretty neat stuff (I will mention the DLCs in the Cons.)

•I got this game for about 8 dollars and you can get good deals pretty often for this game (more about pricing in the cons.)

Cons-

• This game should cost less because of the DLCs. The additional content for this game makes up most of this game and it does not really make sense to pay $30 for the game just to have to pay $209.75 to get all of the DLC. If I did not know this game was published by paradox I would think that it was published by EA.

I hope this helps anybody reading this.

Edit- this game has some decent mods. Just do not expect the mods to be able to replace the DLCs."
24949,everyone is dying 👍
24950,Love it!
24951,"Game good
"
24952,"while the game is fun and will keep you playing for hours... the water physics suck... the water looks more like gel and on the map i played, it was impossible to build a reliable dam. The energy would just fluctuated up and down like crazy... If you can power your city off of other stuff and avoid the dam, then most of other things seem fun."
24953,Amazing city builder! Very in-depth and amazing mods. I do wish they wouldn't charge for every DLC that kinda seems essential in the base game

24957,"Great game, but you NEED all of the DLC's and a few quality of life mods to get the full experience"
24958,Love this game
24959,"I'm not super into this type of oversee-simulation type of game, but this can be fun if you choose to get into it. I find it very hard to get up and running with a functioning city since I always end up losing money and never being able to progress further. But once you get a working city, it becomes very satisfying to watch and see."
24960,"This game is fairly difficult, I'll tell you that. It is definitely fun to play for many different reasons, and with the expansions there seems to be even more, but honestly even without them the game is super fun to play! It can be a ragey game if you are the type to get angry at games since it is pretty difficult to solve issues that you have at times, but it does get easier and easier as you play. I personally would buy the game if you enjoy designing and managing things in games, because that's exactly what this game is about!"
24961,Solid time-killer. No mods necessary.
24962,gud game
24963,Best City building game in the world no other city building game is better
24964,love it

24966,Best City Builder in a while
24967,Were you the kid who played roller coaster tycoon but only made miniature railways and then got mad that your guests didn't ride them?  If so this game's for you.
24968,I got it for free and know I can't play it because i didn't pay for it. but its a really good game.
24969,Very relaxing and fun game that you can find yourself playing for hours and hours.
24970,"TOP Game, if like building cities and learning more on assets an Mods brill time flies away when getting stuck into building a city"
24971,Very City
24972,Be warned that it is a major time suck. Seriously addictive!
24973,good game C:
24974,Anyone who knows...knows!  This is by far the best city sim out right now and has been for years.  The modding allowance and workshop content make any idea a possibility.  Love this game and can't wait for the next iteration!
24975,"fuck you

24976,One of the best city building games

24979,Brilliant game. Very satisfying when you get your first functional city.
24980,"fun city game, nice graphics"
24981,"I don't like that I downloaded 10 gb to play only for 1 hour and then it tells me to purchase it, like, dude, come on, it said it was the complete version, and it was, but they just gave it to test it without being able to play that world again, and it wasn't a demo, now, If I need to talk about the actual game it's pretty fun, but needing to buy all those DLCs just for some texture things are dumb, like, you can get money from other way, not like that"

24996,build city fun
24997,"Has to be my favorite City Sim. I find myself randomly coming back to this game every few months, building a metropolis, then doing it all over again."
24998,"Seems like most content is in payed DLC, so you're only buying an incomplete game. But anyway, there's no undo button so you're constantly making mistakes. Super hard to place things perfectly--you have to use tiny mouse movements to get just the right angle. Annnd on a stressful day you can open up this game for the first time in years and play for 6 hours making the perfect city you're super proud of and looking forward to your progress when suddenly you accidentally press the F5 key. What does the F5 key do? Loads the quicksave. Did I make a quicksave? No, I didn't even know it had that feature. When was the last quicksave? Literally years ago. Did my city autosave? No. Do I have any good will toward the developers of this game? None whatsoever."

25005,Yes nerds
25006,"Takes time to pick up the basics and balance your budget, but it's a lot of fun and the videos on youtube, specifically city planner plays city sims or something like is really helpful"
25007,one word YES
25008,"I always found Sim City (et al) very restricted, and CS came like a breath of fresh air. The UI is a bit all over the place, I miss my graphs, but then there's probably mods for that. I'd like to see more realism in pollution. (I am a bit behind in Achievements, because a planning mode is missing and so I mostly play Unlimited Funds)"
25009,The best City Builder out there.
25010,fun
25011,All this proves is that I shouldn't be sat in a seat of power because it will go bad quick
25012,gud
25013,yes
25014,"I absolutely love this game because it is the type of games where you sink a lot of time playing it.

Its the type of game that requires a lot of brain to play perfectly in not infinite money 
I recommend this game to anyone who likes using a lot of brain while playing and/or you are a creative person
to recreate your home city, your town or your perfect city. 
Me personally i have played this for obnoxiously long times for my standard would recommend 9/10"
25015,"This game is very intuitive and is very fun and addicting. however, it is somewhat hardware demanding even on the lowest settings, overall 4/5 stars"
25016,"While the base game is somewhat lackluster (at least without copious amounts of DLC), this game has one of the best and most expansive modding communities for any game out there. I barely ever use mods for other games; but with Cities: Skylines I would be surprised if less than 90% of my time was spent using mods.

The C:S devs have done a great job supporting and encouraging this community with easy formatting and accessibility features on both the game itself and the workshop.

TL:DR; meh on its own, best city-builder there is with mods (and a beefy computer).

I'd rate 9/10"
25017,"So much better than other similar city sims in my opinion - there's a lot more customizability, mods, and overall it's worth the money."
25018,beast game to play in school
25019,After simcity this game is the flag carrier now. Support it with mods and it will become more fun. Game still has problems when cities grow too much like traffic jams. Definitely recommend.
25020,"Immersive, challenging and rewarding."
25021,much fun
25022,Ops 1000 plus hours.. Yes I Love this game...
25023,Difficult at first but easy once you know how to do things. Epic game!
25024,"Great game that can keep you busy for hours, trying to get that one little piece of road just right. I do recommend using mods, some of them are just essential to be able to play the game properly."
25025,good
25026,"So much to do and try in this game, so little time in the day!"
25027,"cities is a very fun game, and is quite easy to run.. unless you do heavy modding, then it will (probably) bring a nasa computer to its knees"
25028,"Building my own world, now I can't finish because the game is limited...  Look at my photos...  I'm not finished"
25029,city go brrrrrr
25030,I recommend this game. Greatly expands on features and everything I like about other city building games. I also am a big fan of the community. This is something that has helped get me through tough times. Thank you.
25031,Its ok
25032,"i like it. mods make it better :)

Give me cities skylines 2"
25033,Pinavia
25034,"Very unrealistic. I got the industries and harbor games to simulate any city that exists in the Midwest. Doesn't work. The only foresting industry in this game is owned by the government. The only farms in this game are those owned by the government.

Entrepreneurial cities in this game are almost exclusively business centers. It's a simulator of socialist cities. Beyond that, it's a fictional metropolis simulator only, and they do what they can to skip the young-city phase of any new town.

I don't write reviews of many games, but this one was such a big disappointment. If I even cared to simulate the real life-cycle of a city, I would need an insane number of mods. This game is best used as a sandbox city creator, not a city simulator."
25035,"its fun but hard
"
25036,"<3<3 (>.<)9 *kissy noises* its fantastic in an itilian accent

25044,always evolving
25045,"Я давно не играл, вышло куча апдейтов и ДЛС, у меня ничего этого нет. 
Захотел поиграть, всё здорово, начал строить, развился, перешёл к общ. транспорту, автобусы сделал, начал метро делать, раз станцию, два, три, восемь станций и пришла пора это соеденить и инструмент не доступен. Начал гуглить, ничего не нашёл. Начал другие виды строить, наземное метро, другое метро и инструмент для линий метро стал доступен, думаю окей, хвала разрабочикам, контент пошёл. 
Выбираю начало маршрута, делаю первую остановку и ничего не происходит, нажимаю по станцию - всё плохо и не работает. Удалил игру. разработчики уроды."

25048,"I came to this from PS4, and I can't recommend  this enough! The addition of workshop mods has made it so much more enjoyable!"
25049,"SimCity (już na PC, ale bez numerków jeszcze) zawsze będzie głęboko w moim sercu - jako pierwsza gra tego typu w jaką grałem. C:S nie tylko kultywuję tę tradycję, ale wznosi ją na nowy poziom. Jako ""casualowy"" gracz doceniam tę frajdę, kiedy mogę na kilkanaście minut zasiąść i pokombinować jak tu zlikwidować korek na zjeździe z autostrady, albo gdzie tu zbudować park i w którą stronę od tego momentu się kierować. 

Mnóstwo modów (których nie używam raczej, jeden z niewielu których chciałbym używać - TM:PE ma aktualnie problemy pod Linuksem) pozwala na całkowite dostosowanie gry do własnych preferencji. Podobnie możliwość używania lub tworzenia własnych assetów (brak ci jakiejś drogi? To se ją zbuduj!).

No co tu dużo mówić - któż mógłby odmówić sobie przyjemności zbudowania własnego miasta i zarządzania nim? Szczególnie, że można to robić po godzinie co dwa tygodnie (been there, done that)."
25050,i just cant deal with this anymore
25051,I've got over 800 hours on this game since it released. It's got quite the good modding community and that definitely adds longevity to the game. I highly recommend it if you're looking to build a city. The engine is something to be desired but overall the game is fun.
25052,"I love city builder games and this game is hands-down the best one there is. It's super fun to see your city grow and the DLC's are great and add a lot of content, although they can be pricey. There are a few annoying bugs in the game such as the policy menu breaking and never showing up again but other than that and a few other lesser bugs the game runs fine. There's also a ton of Steam Workshop content that enhances the game greatly. If you are a fan of city builders than this game is a must have and if you are looking into getting into these types of games then this is a great start."
25053,Cool and interesting
25054,This is an awesome game! It's very realistic and really pushes you to find a balance between aesthetics and practicality. I would highly recommend this game to anyone who likes city builders.
25055,good game its amazing
25056,"My brother got me this game for my b-day and I probably wouldn't of gotten it myself but its great!! It was confusing at first but once you know how it works its great! My city has about 26,000 people and more and more people are moving in!! I would highly recommend this game to anyone who enjoys games like: Sims City, Planet Coaster and Planet Zoo. If you like any of those games I am SURE you would like this one a lot!!!"
25057,ye
25058,"good with no mods, great with mods"
25059,Neat way to waste time.
25060,is good
25061,yh
25062,"So calming.  Perfect mechanics.  A few things could be better, but the great mods make it better.  I love this game 100/10."
25063,Sure.
25064,I love the customization ability.
25065,"The best City Builder ever!

Since i was young i have been a huge fan of city builder games. I grew up with Simcity and enjoyed the feeling of managing and creating ur own city. Cities Skylines has so much freedom by building in any way u want. Cities Skylines actually supports MODS and allow players to use their own creativity to improve the game. I cant say anything more than that u should seriously play this game. U wont regret it! Feel free to ask questions before buying in the Communitypage with many helpfull citybuilders ready to answer ur questions. 

I once started playing this game with some doubt if it would ever give me the same feeling as Simcity 2000. But after u get the hang of the game, u wont even remember any of those older games. Cities Skyline is just the best builder game there is, no doubt.
"
25066,It be lit
25067,"One of the very best games, and genres ever created. Highly recommended.
Come watch my stream on TTV ""EthericPanda"" for tips and tricks!"
25068,I build City :3
25069,It's good
25070,"Cities Skylines was my 11th game in my 2021 challenge to finish all the uncompleted games in my Steam library and write a review of them. My 'completion' for this game was to unlock all the monuments which took me about 50 hours. 

I'd played Cities Skylines a bit when it first came out and the developers have clearly done a lot of work on it while I'm away. City building games were one of the first I got hooked on - I put hundreds of hours into the original Sim City, and having built a map-covering city in Skylines I felt like I was only scratching the surface of it, with expansions, assets and mods that will definitely have me return to the game when this challenge is over.

If you're looking for a good city building game with lots of content, then this is the one."
25071,fun stuff
25072,Best city builder money can buy
25073,"its decent
"
25074,"Exceptional - definitely the best of it's kind on the market.  A spiritual successor to Sim City of old (unlike the actual successor which was a dumpster fire)

The UI is a little more controller-tailored (ie clunky) than I think was necessary.  Mods can fix this, but it shouldn't be a thing in a city-builder to begin with.

I'm not thrilled with the Paradox DLC strategy either, but I still fall for it every time.  They're overpriced, even at the sale price, but still worth the investment."
25075,"Based upon the experience of just the base game without DLC: I find it to be a nice and relaxing game, one of the better citybuilding games (not to mention addictive). Lots of mods and other stuff to be found on the internet and Steam Workshops. 

Ingame radiostations are nice as well, but limited. Lots of other radiostations can be purchased, so if the base game radiostations don't meet your preference in music there could be another one that does. Alternatively turn off the radiostation ingame and have your own Spotify running outside of the game as radiostation."
25076,surprisingly addictive. Played for 20 hours now and will probably clock a few more. Don't know for sure about longterm longevity of play but we'll see. 8.5/10 so far
25077,Expands on SimCIty by allowing customization of almost every feature of building the city.  Very entertaining!
25078,x
25079,This game is verry nice and good and recomended to buy
25080,"Great city building sim. Although, I get bored quickly and feel others will also get bored quickly."
25081,Hallo comrade your job is tu mak an nice a verry nice citey and BUILD MOTHERRUSSIA SOME NUCLEAR POWUR PLATS THAN PROCEDD TO MURDER THEM WITH GENISICTIS
25082,"Cities>Sim City. So if you like Sim City, I think you may end up loving this a lot more. Add ons are too expensive at regular price, however a lot of major updates have been added to the base game at no cost with each DLC release. The community is where the real game starts to shine. The possibilities are nearly endless thanks to Workshop incorporation. Game is good."
25083,Great Game! I just wish the dlc's were a bit cheaper.
25084,"Easily the most in-depth and flexible city builder out there.  Workshop content is plentiful, though vanilla gameplay can still provide dozens of hours of enjoyment. 10/10 would recommend, I've even gifted this game to several friends."
25085,g
25086,Have the game on my xbox s and was ready for more play that the pc version brings. It is AMAZING! I actually can build a city with plenty of room.
25087,"This is the kind of game that you can really get into!  I love the incredible detail in the game.  I get so involved and, without realizing it, HOURS have passed by!"
25088,fubn
25089,"Like how building a city feels so organic in this game. After SimCity 4 the genre was needing an update, one that preferably had more freedom. This is it. The only downside to the game I feel is that without mods the buildings lack a degree of distinctiveness so to speak."
25090,"Cities: Skylines, is one of the most innovative city builder games since the genere was invented. Immersive, and just wonky enough for those of us who *want* to spend our weekends divising effectual traffic policies and tax distributions, I would highly recommend this game to anyone who is looking for an easily playable, and supremely enjoyable, city builder."
25091,#1 Chill game!
25092,"fun game, even better with the free community mods"
25093,"Extremely fun, has tons of re-play value and I'd definitely recommend the game.

25097,"very accurate city simulator
"
25098,"Still haven't found a better city builder game. Comprehensive, good UI, funny, looks great, radio stations are top notch, but above all - it's fun and engaging as hell."
25099,"One of the best city building game I have played, especially with all the mods. Only downside is that there are a lot of dlc's which I am not a fan."
25100,swag
25101,"I was looking for SimCity for so long, and then along came this Cities: Skylines and behold I found it. Plays just like the original. Yes, I highly recommend this game!"
25102,"This is a fun creative outlet for wannabe civil engineers and Sims lovers alike. Some of the mechanics are clunky and difficult to master (see: traffic circles) but you can mostly work around it. An intensely pretty game with tremendous ambience thanks to the visual effects and music, it's a ton of fun even without a ton of DLC."
25103,Great City Builder....SOO MUCH TO DO!!!!
25104,"nuked a city, it was fun,"
25105,11/10
25106,.
25107,"excellent game but the best of this game its an art of itself, the community support your work and gives you positive feedback in order to achieve a better city, Not being a competitive game helps to everybody to make a better and pretty city"
25108,This is a very fun and relaxing game. I love to start my cites from scratch and watch them grow.

25113,Super fun! Great city builder.
25114,Routing bin lorries has never been so fun!
25115,it's a great game but it's only playable in a large scale with mods. AI is dumb and the tool tips are subpar. Great with mods though!
25116,Decent Game
25117,"It's fun if you've got lots of free time to slowly watch a city grow. Recommend caution though, one wrong move with your finances and the city spirals into disrepair. So save often."
25118,"Ay, is good."
25119,Good game

25138,"I play the game for a good while, then I think to myself ""I think I'll try one of the challenge maps, I think I am ready"" but I wasn't ready, oh no I wasn't ready at all, I chose the archipelago map and I had a good time, built a small cute town of around 2600 or so, and then suddenly, my camera is moved to the side of my town, to my shock I find a tsunami! I was shocked... it steamrolled my city, everybody died and I went bankrupt.

25146,It's sim city.  Without EA.  What's not to like?
25147,"I have been playing city builders since Sim City 2000 and I gotta say, this is the best city-building game ever made, no contest. There are some nitpicks and some ideas from Sim City 2013 I wish they would incorporate, like linking your cities together in a county, but other than that everything you could ask for in a city-builder is here and the assets you can find on the Steam Workshop gives near endless possibilities to liven up the gameplay. 9.5/10 Would play again :p"
25148,epic
25149,lol yes
25150,"This game is amazing. I played non stop for so long and never got bored. I was so bad at the game that I almost killed everyone with filthy water! I didn't know what was happening! But 1 thing, the dams are really glitchy, as I flooded my city 4 times. When I sold it, there was a giant sunami and the water glitched out."
25151,"Great Game Its like simcity but with alot more content if you include the workshop
Truly i havent had any issuses while playing altho i dont even have 100 hours yet"

This is an extremely poorly developed game. Grief platform Riddled with fuckery"

25170,السلام علمكم
25171,Nice One. Cheap Game Expensive DLC
25172,i get to relive being in debt over and over
25173,"It's good game, well made and can offer nice relaxing times. The reason I gave negative review is that, it's has some annoying bugs / ""features"", which sometimes makes building something logical to impossible. Killing your mood or inspiration to continue building your city, since the game will alter the terrain itself, and/or won't let you alter it by yourself because of ""reasons"". Also the road/railway building system is sometimes f♥cky when it comes to making totally logical crossroads because, game just chose to not letting you do so for god knows why."
25174,"Honestly, 

This game is amazing, I played this a lot before I got the game on steam and loved it. The idea of just building up your city making sure that traffic flows good and a bunch of other things that come into play when you're building up your master city.

100% recommended"
25175,citi
25176,relaxing and fun way to unleash your creativity.
25177,i drowned a city with raw sewage

perfect if you think sim city is too easy."
25179,So addicting!
25180,yes
25181,it good but wait for sale some dlc is kinda very important.
25182,"The basics of the game are a bit difficult to get the hang of to start, but once you've figured out how to stop your citizens from launching you into debt right off the bat, you're pretty much fine. Super fun game, very laid-back and relaxed. If you're into the Sims and Planet Coaster, and Planet Zoo (and other simulations like that,) you will likely enjoy this as well."

25213,"I haven't enjoyed a city building simulator to this extent since SimCity 2000. I haven't tried any DLC yet as I am still learning how to play efficiently but some of them seem interesting. I played many hours of this game originally on Xbox One, and I aim to continue playing this a lot when I want reprieve from multiplayer games."

25227,Picked up where S.C. left off and blew it's doors off.
25228,"This game is pretty fun. A great sale pick-up! Industries and natural disaster DLC are fun, too.  I usually don't buy extra DLC for games, but for Skylines I recommend it when it goes on sale."
25229,"Beg me for infrastructure, I will make roads that look like penises all the same"
25230,Yease verie gud.
25231,"Game is weirdly addicting
"
25232,"Game takes 1 hour to load and to quit. Plus It's unplayable on my labtop.. Crash, and freezes.. Waste of my money..
"
25233,"so uh bassicly this game is awesome bro, i love the mods n stuff"
25234,yes
25235,"relaxing little city simulator until you frantically attempt to fix a sudden widespread problem lol. Runs great, good time waster, and the mod community is surprisingly active considering the age of the game"
25236,"Picked up the game while it was on the free play pass and then realized 99% of the game is locked behind a DLC list long enough to eclipse the sun and bring about the final solution to global warming we have all been waiting for.

What I mean by that is my first 4 hours was spent dumping sewage upstream from my city's singular source of fresh water in a gambit to overtax the population through medical expenses and renaming every industrial zone to Dick's Sporting Goods as to trick the uninformed masses that Nike sneakers improves your overall health by an undefined metric proportional to the manufacturer suggested retail price of the item.

Everyone left my city and then the trial period ended. 10/10 would never pay for this game."
25237,This review is a DLC
25238,It wraps you in...pretty darn good!
25239,very good
25240,"Fun creative game , get tired of civilians complaining after a while. 

I suggest just play it with mods"
25241,"I love this game, it is a surberb city buildings game with amazing graphics and awesome soundtrack, with tons of fun DLC. this game is worth every penny."
25242,"Okay so. The first thing you wanna do in this game if your reading this. Build the the main two things. Sewage ant the eletric. Then goto roads after you built a road. If you downloaded mods use them! But uh back to it, Then go to the zoning area. The green, brown, yellow, and blue. Select the yellow one. Place it on your street. I recommend making a road goto somewhere else then your residental. Well a basic start up there ya go! This is a quide/review. So on to the review. I recommend this game to engineers, or if your a guy how buys this. Youtubers will get a key. If your a youtuber but not a big one hope for the best. I have 4 subs. My channel is WW2 and Stuff. But yea 10/10"
25243,its really fun with stupid mods but i dont know a single person who plays this game normally
25244,never have been able to get into this - optimisation has also always been an issue for me
25245,"Rada rada ra ra radara rada, rada ra rada rada"
25246,"if you like creativity this game is a must. I simply got PC to get this game, since I played it on xbox before. worth it to get the pc version."
25247,"I've seen some reviews that talk about this game showing its age or that it eats up ram. Id like to give my input. First, will someone name a better city builder that is comparable? This game laughs at sim city like the disgrace it is. It may eat up your ram, but chances are as long as your computer was not built in 2010 I am sure it will run just fine. You could also just buy more ram for those that have a desktop. This game is great. I would recommend however to wait for the DLC to go on sale and buy it at half off. Otherwise fantastic game!"
25248,Great if you like micromanaging
25249,good
25250,"I love this game. 

I have been playing it mostly vanilla and keep finding reasons to come back again and again for hours on end to lay out new cities and more recently, work on the fine details, traffic flow, etc.

Highly recommened."
25251,Nice game!
25252,A must play
25253,I've played city builders from Sim City 2000 on and as a guy who gets stoned and just stares at his computer this is great.
25254,"Good details, sky is the limit."
25255,Good interface.
25256,very fun game
25257,"if you love building stuff, this game is perfect for you. it is a bit pricey tho. wait for a sale."
25258,NICE
25259,love it bit complicated at start but good once you get going
25260,"Although my potato computer gets 10-18 fps, it's still so fun that i woulf still keep on playing it no matter what. highly reccomend it for people who like city building games"
25261,yes
25262,gg
25263,"A spiritual successor to SimCity 4. It's the only city builder worth your time. I don't give it a full 10 on 'Gameplay' because it requires mods for what I think should be basic features like traffic control or more accurate / fine-tune road placement. It doesn't get a full 10 on 'Graphics & Sound' because while it looks okay, it's starting to show it's age and I've never had an amazing FPS on this game despite having very good hardware. I also don't give it a full 10 on 'Playability' because it also (in my opinion) requires DLC for some of the best features and if you wanted to get all of them it can be a bit of a pricey fix. I waited for a sale and then bought the entire bundle at a discount and it was still pretty steep--but worth it.

Cities: Skylines gives me the same [i]""one more turn...""[/i] feel that the Civilization games give me. You just want to keep going; and then when you wanna stop, it's usually because you just got 10 more better ideas and want to start a new city over from scratch. It's all very satisfying and endlessly replayable. In a world that is so infatuated with medieval / fantasy / sci-fi city builders (for good reason btw), this game stands alone right now as the best of the best when you're looking for the quintessential [b]CITY[/b] builder. I was so upset with how SimCity (2013) was handled but this game fills in that void and then some.

The game itself can be quite challenging if you're just getting used to the game, it's definitely a spiritual successor to SC4 in that the city simulation in the background is much more in-depth it seems. My advice is to start small, even if you turned on infinite money you might overwhelm yourself making your network of roads first rather than building and growing a sustainable infrastructure. Managing RCI in this game still feels very similar to SC3000 / SC4 though, as well as the disaster mechanics and ploppable monument buildings.

The only real feature that I miss from SimCity 4 that I wish Cities: Skylines made an attempt on creating is the region map. Granted, the maps you can make and use in this game to build on are quite massive, especially with a mod that allows you to buy all the tiles on the map. However, there was something so fun about first terraforming and creating your own region, and then building towns and/or cities based on what you want that region to specialize in. Maybe you want one smaller region to be farmland and a small town, and you make a connection to a neighboring region tile that has a much larger town, connected to a region with where you wanna put your main huge metropolis. There are ""outside connections"" in Cities: Skylines but it all really just runs as part of the simulation, and not something you have direct control over.

If you liked SimCity 4 or SimCity 3000, I highly doubt you'll ask for a refund on this one. Even the base game without any DLC is worth your time, it's just that the DLC adds so much to the game, like building your own university campus. The integration this game has with the Steam Workshop is also [i]excellent[/i], it's so seamless and there's such a wealth of user-created content at your fingertips. If you're on the fence about this game, just try it and see. No game is perfect but if there's ever a sequel to this game and [i]this[/i] is the bar they set on their first try, then I'm unbearably excited for that.

Just please, whatever you do, don't mistake Cities XL for this game.

25265,"its good, but it needs mods to be really good, shame there are so many dlc, but hey at least it isnt another simcity, cause that was god awful"
25266,"City Skylines is a great game, but the price of DLC has put me off significantly. I have bought the base game, and enjoy it that way, and I would recommend doing the same unless you have a large sum of cash to spend."

25287,"Do not buy this game. All it is is wait for the game to tell you what you need to add more of, and then add more of that. Extremely shallow. I guess its alright if you like making nice looking cities and shit, but if you want a good city building game get rimworld or something else"
25288,Very immersive game with the DLC. Much Better then Sim city franchise!
25289,"Simulasi yang luar biasa dan sangat detil, lebih luas pola permainannya dibandingkan SimCity dan lebih kompleks. Bisa merasakan sulitnya mengelola sebuah kota.

Thumbs up for the developers!!."
25290,It is a very good game where you build a thing 10/10
25291,Probably the best City Sim game out right now.
25292,"Pretty cool, actually. Didn't expect much at first, but now, I see it's a pretty fun game, you can zone areas and build your little city, you can make money, you can tackle issues like pervasive disease, that sort of thing. Pretty nice."
25293,If you wanted to buy all the DLC it would cost $200+ lol
25294,"Played this on the Xbox for many, many hours before moving to PC. The best city builder in a while."

25296,Mantap jiwa lah pokoknya. Excellent game to fill your bored time at home in this COVID-19 situation
25297,Surprisingly interesting and complex city builder. Has a bit of a learning curve ;) but it is very rewarding. Congratulations for the developers of this game as this is a real achievement. If there is one thing; I wish they would improve the UX of the game interface.
25298,"Best city builder there is, hands down, its not even close."
25299,When I'm not playing this I'm watching other people play it.

25310,"Cities Skylines is truly a sandbox game that you design and create your own city.  

The original game is fun to play with a basic plan to design, build and maintain a city.  

Added DLC enlarges the scope of buildings and modulates more options for designing and running your city.  It is certainly worth adding all the content you can from DLC and the mods available, however like many things the more you add the more chances of things taking longer to run and your city can become more awkward and complicated, so plan well.  

My advice is buy the game with basic DLC to run a city how you want and add more later. 

The steam workshop is amazing with this game and the internal game system offers opportunity for you to make your own structures, vehicles and layouts; to keep your city building and designing fun.  

This game potential is huge with extensive maps and design-able content that make this game a gigantic upgrade from the original sim city type games.  

With the general graphics and function there are some very realistic design features and graphics where you could create literally your own local neighbourhood in this game and it can be almost photo realistic with mods.  

I give this game 4/5 stars as the engine is well made but needs tweaking with DLC mods from the workshop to be perfect."
25311,"Great.
DLC is expensive."
25312,.
25313,OTS GOOD
25314,"Absolutely time consuming-good fun. I have to be honest, starting this game was a mess, since I had no idea what worked with what, in terms of residential planning, industrial and commercial. But it does give you a satisfying feeling once you've solved problems relating to traffic, electricity and etc. etc. I give it a 8.5/10. Would rate this higher if more of DLC content was added to the Deluxe addition but no complaints, am still having fun."
25315,"It's pretty cool I suppose, I can never get a town to work right because I always run out of money. It seemed like it would be a lot of fun and I'm sure it would be if I knew how to do it right. Maybe I need more practice, or maybe I'm just an idiot. Either way, this game requires a lot of brainpower to be fun/possible. I wouldn't pay full price for it and I'm glad I didn't because I will probably never play it again, it's too hard and I'm too dumb."
25316,"please update the game performance and graphic, I want to play the game without hundred thousands of mods and assets :("
25317,"Great Game, especially if you watch Biffa fix cities, and make cities!"
25318,"Building a city is tough. You need to know what you have atm, what you dream for it to become in future while also dealing with problems along the way.

That's what I got from this game."

I have reviewed the online help - tried the ""noWorkshop"" tag, and have uninstalled Citrix but it still won't run.

Found the ""non Paradox Launcher"" option - still no success

Have uninstalled the game, but now I can't find it in my library to re-install.

When I open the game in the Steam Store, it says it exists in my library, but it still won't run.

Have checked the game folder in the ""SteamApps"" directory - no game files exist.

Hoping someone might have some advice?"
25360,Yes.  This is a game.  A game you can spend time on.  A game you can spend more time that you'd really like to spend time on.  It is good.  You will enjoy it if you like building cities.
25361,"Loads of fun. Just get it on sale, there is way too much DLC. Vanilla with mods is still really fun."
25362,It becomes a puzzle game when you have to fix a traffic jam.

25364,gud game
25365,"really fun game, great way to kill time
also kinda addictive once you get going, the amount of things you can do in this game are endless

25370,"It is fun. The more detail and control, the better. However, it should be better organized. Displays popping up here and there. Obscure the screen. Sometimes get in the way of the experience. Maybe, a designated area along the top and bottom, only. Like in Sid Meier's Civilization. Also, bubble screens when you mouse over should be as small as possible and disappear. Within a short amount of time. You can always mouse over again, or the screen to keep it open. The more fluid and responsive to actions, the better."

25407,"Cities: Skylines is the game that helped me re-discover my childhood love of gaming.

After the disappointing release of Sim City (2013), C:S arrived on the scene full of passion and love for the original gameplay that made city simulation a treat for us who grew up in the 90s. It took the last two decades worth of sim mechanics and improved upon them in a way that was natural for us old timers and welcoming to new comers. One of the first things I remember in my earliest cities on C:S was how organic and natural it felt to build the city of my dreams. There was a lot less time spent stumbling and far more time spent having fun.

On the surface it's a gorgeous game. I've always been hesitant to get into 3D world building games, as some of the early entries available in the 00s looked downright gaudy. Compared to old school 2D gaming (especially tried and true isometric  view points), the art style was a huge turn off. C:S came out late enough in the era of 3D moveable viewpoints that it gave its art style a proper polish. Furthermore, with mods that allow you street views of your city, the world of C:S feels infinitely larger and vast compared to other city simulation games. It creates a level of immersion I've only gotten tastes of in the ill-fated game Streets of Sim City. At times, the art does suffer from some of the low poly ugliness typical in early 3D games (don't ever look too closely at the sims walking around in your city), but on the whole it stands up pretty dang well, helped in no small part by the amount of modding assets you can import to beautify your city. 

Part of what makes it such a stunning game to look at is the free form, organic nature to design available to the player. Most city builders require a grid-like system as a result of the blocky zoning tools. While C:S still requires a degree of block zoning, it allows the roads and pathways you lay down to facilitate those zones in an unlimited degree of curvature. Furthermore, instead of limiting the player to a few specific road junctions and connections, transit is given freedom of height and range to create intersections and overpasses I've never seen before. Don't want two roads to intersect? Have one bridge over the other. Don't want a railway junction along these streets? Just raise the rails above all the roads. Wish you had a freeway off ramp that deposited commuters directly into a specific district? Extend it out from the freeway into the development as far as you want, even going underground if that's easier. Need to connect five separate roads at once? You get the picture. The game allows a pretty impressive scope to what your roads and railways can do if you're willing to stretch your imagination and play around with the mechanics.

Urban development facilitates movement in a faster pace to late game city highrises, if that's your goal. As someone who loves creating canyons of skyscrapers, it's nice to have that option sooner rather than later. So many other city simulators force several hours of foundation setting to get a city large enough to support highrise development, but C:S knows that some players want to build those first. Zone enrichment and upgrade mechanics allow you the option to go straight to skyscraper city or spend longer in quieter town layouts if you prefer. The size and density of your urban planning is far more flexible for whatever gameplay you prefer. 

Traffic is certainly a beast in the game, since every vehicle is simulated in real time. It gives transit a much more realistic appearance, since vehicles aren't merely moving art that fade in or out to feign motion. Vehicles leave residential areas and commute to work. Trucks leave industrial parks to move goods to your commercial districts and transport materials off the map. Emergency vehicles have to leave fire/police/hospitals to get to a crisis somewhere else in your city. This means gridlock can become a very real problem to the inexperienced layout designer. A lot of my first cities were plagued by huge blocks of cars and trucks stuck in roads without much flow. Firetrucks sat in congestion while buildings burned down because they couldn't get there. There will be times you'll feel less like you're playing a city simulator and more of a traffic simulator because of how consuming it is to keep everything flowing smoothly. Road upgrade tools are a heaven-send in this regard, because you aren't required to bulldoze existing roads to move up to avenues or even highways. Round-a-bouts and custom intersections also make all the difference, allowing you to keep busy roads constantly moving instead of waiting at traffic lights. You'll certainly have to experiment a lot to stay on top of congestion; for some people this is a huge turn off. You have been warned. 

There's so much more I could say to heap praises on this game. Some of the DLC is fluff you don't need to waste your money on, while others add so much to the game I can't imagine playing it vanilla. The base game is certainly worth the initial price-tag though, so treat yourself and start experimenting today. You'll have time for DLC and mods down the road. But don't be surprised if you lose hours of your life because it's simply too fun to put down."

I think its because i dont have a graphics acrd. just the intel chip set. Anyway.. I asked steam for a refund, but they would not give me one because their steam system thought i had played it for 9 hours... I had not played it at all.. it would not start. Their refund policy apears to be a con.... 

I am now trying to download the mac version of city skylines.. to see if I can getit working on a mac.. but can not find an option to download or add to a queue..... ugh...."
25418,"good game for city building, dont recommend for rams under 8 gb and graphics under 1080"
25419,"Extremely good yet extremely unrefined base game. I'll buy expansions, but there are a lot of things I am discovering at 100 hours in that make this game annoyingly difficult to justify playing beyond 100 hours or so. You can have a fully self sufficient city that you can walk away from, but the player can't because they have to constantly manage landfill and cemeteries. People, trash, same thing, why not just throw them all in a landfill, and have it automatically empty into an incinerator. While this sounds like a small annoyance, it would be, if it weren't for the fact that if you like to play the game on triple speed, your city can go from +$10k/wk to - $10k/wk almost instantly. It's difficult to keep your city from going bankrupt because trash and dead bodies are piling up in the street even when half of your available infrastructure is in use. The problem should not exist at all, and it causes people to move out in droves, which creates abandoned buildings which the player has to remove manually (while the game is paused), otherwise the presence of abandoned buildings causes even more people to move out in droves.

If you have dead bodies pile up in the streets, you should at least program a zombie outbreak scenario to trigger to make it interesting. If expansion DLC don't have fixes for these problems (among other smaller annoyances), then IMO the base game is almost unplayable. I'd rather manage cities, not compost.

Presently this is a 51% ""yes I do recommend this game"". You might love it, hate it, both, or not touch it at all. 
I could highlight some other pet peeves and some unrealistic characteristics about the game, but it's very good for what it is, but I would rather play SimCity for the simplicity and lack of need to babysit it. I'd rather have to deal with damage control from natural disasters and such, not from poor programming."
25420,"Played SIM CITY up to SIM3000 in the past but got frustrated with the lack of control.  Skylines has a much more immersive interface and involvement with various aspects of management while retaining a similar 'feel' for city building.  There seem to be lots of discounted options available at the moment (early 2021) but, since there are so many DLCs to tempt you to spend more, the game could end up costing more than you originally planned.  Base level at a bargain price though, so it is cheap to buy just that initially to confirm that you like the gaming experience."

I was a bit tricky to get into at first but I managed to find my way around the game, it is fun to watch as the city grows and when you start making money off the city and realize that hours had gone by. The only problems for me though is that the DLC might be a bit pricey and some things are hard to learn. (I think I will pay for the game though.)"
25457,"When I was looking for an intriguing city building game I never thought that a game would satisfy that need, but to my surprise this game is everything I was looking for. This game is everything that games like SimCity aren't. Very good game that actually allows you to get a realistic feel of a Mayor's perspective of a city. 10/10"
25458,used to be better without their new launcher and shitty eula
25459,"I thought this would be better than Sim City 4 etc but actually, I don't think it is. And the base game is quite boring. I imagine it will be fab with the expansion packs but I don't want to pay extra when I'm not that impressed with the base game."
25460,Best city builder available.
25461,"This game is very detailed and also unfortunataly very cpu intensive its very professionaly polished.
10/10 recommend for anyone with a good pc."
25462,fun city build city game fun play *tumb up*
25463,Only choice for city building sim
25464,GOOD
25465,haha funny city
25466,"I have well over 500 hours in this fabulous game now. It's by far and away the best city builder game out there. In fact, arguably this is a traffic management game, probably more than a city builder. The actual concept of building the city is reasonably easy, but the difficult element of the game is managing the traffic to be able to support growth and enable the city to grow and breath. This is truly much harder than you think to maintain... This really is a case of an easy game to play, but a very difficult game to master (without cheating mods...)

The base graphics and sounds are pretty on the eyes and ears, although nothing earth shattering, but the best element of the game is the developers have opened it up to the modding community. What these souls have done is transformed the game to something so in depth, you can get right down and be involved in the placing of advertising boards, rubbish bins, through to painting lines on road junctions and building things like rocket launches and just about everything in between. 

There are a superb bunch of you-tubers and twitch players that regularly post starter guides and play-along maps and now the game is so heavily discounted (along with much of the excellent DLC), the game is just a bargain to while away a few hours. Even after all this time, I always just want to restart the last map and fix an error I made several days ago, that is now costing my city dear...   Cannot wait for the sequel which surely must be coming!"
25467,Good Game
25468,good game
25469,"The ultimate city simulator, borderline perfect since you can mod it too."
25470,city
25471,"I absolutely  love this game, I've spent several hundred hours on this, though I may not be as good as other people at making and maintaining a City this game is surely really addicting. Tho i recommend modding out the game a bit, like adding custom assets, themes, and getting some game modifying mods, as the vanilla game is mediocre  at best, but with mods, and assets the game becomes god-tier. would 100% recommend buying, and or playing if you already own it."
25472,Too slow.

25483,"It's easy to zone out for hours at a time playing this, and sometimes that's just what you need."
25484,"Bad. Power lines can't cross all roads Controls are just as bad as SimCity, and there's no way to cancel any road/power line placements without leaving the section entirely."
25485,Great game

25502,I like this game
25503,A great game for planning a city to your dimensions and tastes! I think this game is a lot more realistic than sims but that's my personal opinion. I definitely recommend you get a gaming PC with stronger specs if you want to play this game with decent fps and quality

10/10 recommended if you want to have a crippling gaming addiction"
25509,"I absolutely love this game. I've played it since it came out. I was a fan of Sim City so this was the next best option.  My game time is mainly on my Xbox, but I decided to buy it for the computer when I travel too.  

Traveling gives great ideas for new Cities :)."

25515,better  city  sim
25516,Fun game
25517,Very good . Would recomend
25518," This game is very fun. The mechanics are cool, and it is very realistic. However, if you don't like complex games, this one isn't for you. It is the most realistic city building game out there."
25519,"i do not care what you want, i am your ruler."
25520,Great Soothing Game!
25521,"This game is very interactive and allows you to build out your urban fantasies however you desire. It contains many real life aspects and difficulties related to city planning, and allows you to go wild with them. Highly recommend to anyone looking to recreate their hometown or build the next great metropolis."
25522,Invasive data collection - No ability to opt out.
25523,"I started playing Cities: Skylines for the nostalgia value (I grew up playing ""Sim City"") - this game delivers, but also is a lot better in many ways. I haven't launched one, but I think one of the objectives is to launch a rocket?

Pros: 
- This game is an immersive time eater.
- Lots of buttons to click.
- Relaxing, with enough going on to keep things interesting.
- Graphics are nice.
- Clear objectives.
- Some weather variation.

Cons:
- Seriously, this game is so immersive it will eat up your day before you realize it.
- Default buildings are pretty basic; if you want cooler buildings they're in the DLC
- The default background music is a loop that doesn't vary and will get stuck in your head."
25524,VERY NICE
25525,"When you leave your game unpaused for 5 minutes:
50.000 people used to live here, now it's a ghost town..."
25526,"If you like SimCity games and its successors, then you know what you're getting with this game.  It is more of the same, but refined.  This is not a criticism.  It's solid, enjoyable, and you can easily sink some decent time into this game."
25527,"loved the game
"
25528,I never write review but if you like city building games this is the best. I've logged over 200 hours and it's still super fun. Each new city is a brand new experience
25529,I have not played enough to form an opinion.
25530,very addicting

25532,"The game is cool, the community on steam is extremely Toxic. Steam in general is toxic."
25533,More like Counter: Strike lmaoooooo
25534,Good game
25535,More woke bullshit. No churches in this game.
25536,its pretty coolio
25537,"TL;DR
Pros: Gameplay challenges that encourage creativity, Tons of awesome community built Mods
Cons: Yeah you're gonna need the DLC's

Gameplay Challenges
A unique set of challenges face your city and you've got to fix it. But *how* you fix that issue depends entirely on you. Not enough power for your city's grid: do you plop down a coal plant for cheap but dirty power, or do you take a loan to invest in a more expensive but cleaner windmills? Running out of room for RCI: do you make a major investment and expand the city's borders, or you do you focus instead on densifying your existing neighborhoods? There's a million different ways to build your city.

Yeah, You Need the DLC
The vanilla game comes with the basics. But I'd recommend buying as much of the DLC as you can. It's a little shady, but basically the company spread out a lot of really useful options into different DLC's. For instance, the Mass Transit DLC doesn't have Trams (basically a light rail train), but the Snowfall DLC does? Weird, right? What do Light Rail trains have to do with Snow??? It's almost like they knew no one would buy the Snowfall DLC so they took Trams out of Mass Transit and put it there. Point is, if you're really looking for the whole experience, you'll need the DLC.

Mods & Creative Design
If you're not interested in balancing budgets and just want to build your city, there's a mod for that! The game comes with mods that allow you to play without budget constraints, milestones, etc. There's also a HUGE community of mod makers, with everything from unique buildings and vehicles to super creative gameplay mods. Some traffic mods allow you to control which specific lanes allow which kinds of traffic. You can go as deep as you want, I recommend looking up Czardus on youtube he's got some great explainers on gameplay in general, as well as specific mod recommendations.

Realistic Citizens
This may be a little in the weeds, but a big gripe I have with the old Sim City games were limitations on citizens' behavior. For instance, in some of those old games, wealthy/well-educated citizens would *refuse* to use most mass transit options, even if it was the most efficient path to their destination. So weird! In my personal experience, I've known people who take the bus to go to the opera, and I've known people who lived in trailer parks who would never ever ride a bus. People adapt to the transit culture where they live, and Cities Skylines accurately reflects that reality. So if you build a big wide city full of expressway but no transit options, people will tend to drive their cars, but if you build a tight walkable community people will prefer walking, etc. It's all about the options you create for them.

My Favorite Thing
You can click on ANYONE in the game, and just follow them to see what they do. It's so fun to zoom in on a random citizen and see how they choose to get around the city. You can see where they work, where they live, where they like to walk their dog, where they go to shop. It's kinda awesome and it's one of my favorite things to do when I play."
25538,"A rather peaceful game that you can just spend hours and hours building your dream city. While the game can sometimes be rather stressful, it's still enjoyable."
25539,"Excellent game. If you enjoyed and spent lots of hours on SimCity and other city-planners, you will much likely enjoy C:S as well.

I may have played just a few hours, but I think it's enough to review it somehow. I saw my brother playing it for a few weeks before purchasing it myself, so I have some kind of previous knowledge of it. 

(Comment edited to remove a line about in-game traffic management. After many more hours of playing, and a couple of articles read, I found the right approach to it and I'm enjoying the game even more.)"
25540,Yekir
25541,good game
25542,city
25543,"Great game, best city builder ive ever played."
25544,"I am really nerdy and take this game way to seriously. I absolutely love it. I really do recommend it, to the nerdiest of people and to the most relaxed players. It is easy to learn and play, but takes time to perfect. It works very well with certain mods and workshop additions, which really improve the games content. My only complaint is that the traffic can be very unrealistic and impractical at times, like when they only use one lane of traffic when there are 2 others open. Though, with even better city planning, this challenge can be overcame."
25545,Mods
25546,"Awesome simulator. Took a little research to get going, but once the basics were explained, it's pretty self-explanatory. Now I'm overwhelmed at the endless possibilities."
25547,"This game gives you the opportunity to build something of your own and to really care about it. 7.5/10 Vanilla. 8.5/10 Modded. Would have been 9 if it wasn't for the loading times and 10 if the AI was just a tad bit better, but it is all right."
25548,"Great game, Great mods and great community
It is an amazing city builder with 10 of thousands of assets to use 
In conclusion its a great game"
25549,Nice Community <3
25550,yes
25551,Fun to drown people in their own sewage
25552,.
25553,"very good

25555,its really fun!like it
25556,Relaxing and my stress reliever game.

25561,"good game
"
25562,"I am addicted by this game!!! I love it. I can achieve my dream in long time ago!!!!!
It is worthy that you buy this game. I am STRONGLY RECOMMEND you owning this game!!"
25563,"very nice!!! After playing the game for some time I even became interested in city planning. Now I see my own city and I can relate so many things with the game, and I can think from a perspective of a planner instead of a normal citizen"
25564,best game ever
25565,A newer cleaner version of Simcity. Thumbs up from over here.
25566,Very good city building simulation games. Excellent. Worth it.
25567,"Good game, thoroughly enjoyable"

25571,"Just noticed I haven't left a review for this game, which certainly is as great as I thought, and I think it is time for the producer to considers the sequel of this game, hopefully some of the functional defects such as intersection problems can be fixed."
25572,Its very cool and looks awesome
25573,"Very Realistic, this is how to become Mayor
"
25574,The best city simulation game ever.
25575,Quintessential Sandbox Game
25576,great to just play and be relaxed
25577,"i love the game :D
"
25578,"Very enjoyable. I have spent many hours just trying to get out of my tens of thousands of dollars of debt. All of the citizens in my town hate me because their sewage sucks yet the lake is filled with their poop. Also a lot of them have abandoned their houses because I cant put their ded grandparents anywhere because my graves have been filled to the very top. I love my citizens, but they don't love me :(
10/10 Game. Instead of studying for my college classes, I play this as I ignore all 5 of my failing grades."
25579,"the game kinda complex when you first playing
recommend that you should buy the startup bundle (or only industry DLC) start the game from that it alot more easier to play
if you got full DLC the game gonna break ur mind in the first time playing"
25580,Love building a city
25581,classic
25582,Fun to play
25583,"I too, enjoy turning on infinite money to run a dream city only to cause chaos as monetary inflation isn't a thing. 10/10 would cause a city wide flood again."
25584,city yes
25585,fun
25586,its guud
25587,good game
25588,"The best city builder games I've ever played, the graphic is really nice, the simulation of the traffic and people walking on the street is really realistic, really recommend this for people who love to build cities and have a creativity. Really recommend this to any ages because not just for fun but also can improve the way you think, like how to solve some problems in the city you build."
25589,its good
25590,"Where maxis left off... j/k.

You can get lost in the amount of detail a city takes both above ground and below. Love the lighting effects as day turns to night. Spent hours in this game obsessing over details."
25591,city
25592, a man has fallen in lego city
25593,Super fun creative outlet. Easy to enjoy for the more light-hearted gaming experience but also deep enough (especially with mods) that one can get lost in it easily (in a good way)
25594,"Fun game, very addicting. Not overly difficult or overly simple. Best City Sim out there"
25595,"This game is amazing. Just wish I can play it, with the DLC.
(and IK its on gamepass for xbox, but I would rather use k&m then controller.)
(Also, I got this game during the Lunar sale for free for 4 days.)"
25596,"This is basically my favorite game haha
The base game itself is lacking, so thank god basically every asset on Steam is free and doesn't require a dlc. With things off of the workshop, the game is amazing. Would definitely recommend!!"
25597,"gvb
"
25598,Y e s. You build c i t y.
25599,"this game is a really nice game will reccomend
gets boring after a while"
25600,MEATeor
25601,fun
25602,"The best city building game on the market. With so many mods and assets to chose from, it is never ending and ever evolving."
25603,good but gets slow after a while
25604,"Just lost last night progression, 10/10 would redo it again"
25605,i love this game.. the sky is the limit.
25606,"good games, cannot stop playing the first time opened it"
25607,"Great Game, Highly Recommended!"
25608,"yes, its fun ... bye"
25609,"It's a really good game, the only problem is that you need mods to fully enjoy it, go through the workshop and add the best mods like traffic manager, loading screen, move it, etc and you can run into some problems, however with the giant mod community and the already solid base game this is definitely the best city builder of all time.
"
25610,Best thing about this game is that you can expand your cities and buy land outside. Hated Simcity for that
25611,"I mean it is hard sometimes but its fun if you succeed so I would recommend CS.I would personally give it a five out of five so if you like it then have fun.



"
25612,oi8uydjtcfygtrde5dsxrfdrzxcdfxc
25613,"Game is pretty boring by itself. Sure, it may be fun to people who enjoy this kind of game, but it's basic for a city builder. To have any fun you have to buy a LOT of DLC, which shouldn't be the case for any game."
25614,it may be lagy but its a good game
25615,one of my favorite games
25616,"If you loved simulators and city builders, this is pretty much the best thing on the market. I am obsessed with this game. Getting started and going broke a few times means that building up your city feels that much better. Recovering from a dead city or fixing never ending traffic problems also feels like an insane achievement. 

Great game, highly recommend."
25617,fun
25618,More than 70 hours of the mostly chaotic gameplay on my side... but I still love it!
25619,NICE
25620,a fun game to play music in the background and get lost in
25621,I love this game! Except i havent been able to play lately becuase the game just wont load into a map and crashes.
25622,big city can go boom
25623,good game
25624,I named my city New New York City and Harlem robbed Manhattan and then Manhattan blew up the city. 10/10 would get fucked again
25625,"Definitely the best City Builder game available. Period. Unlike the latest City Builder by EA/Maxis.
Community Mods are amazing!
And awesome DLC's available to give hours of building pleasure."
25626,"This game is a time eater, after you get the city going and decide to decorate or improve, the days fly by."
25627,lost track of time.
25628,Great Game!
25629,its fine
25630,Excellent game.

25634,yes very good u can make shit city
25635,"Surprisingly addictive! I thought I wouldn't enjoy this,.. After playing for a while and watching some tutorials on Youtube I really appreciated how much effort city planners put into planning our urban areas. The road hierarchy stuff was actually really fun to puzzle-solve as well."
25636,very good+fun game
25637,you can build cities and one wrong move and the whole fucking place is gone

25639,"Great game, never gets old."
25640,"If I wanted to LARP as a commie. I'd play this.

Can't create a tax free utopia.

Can't create my desired welfare state with people of certain tribal traits.

25641,game is fun.
25642,"For anyone who used to play SimCity, this is a way more modern and cool version - but similar enough that you won't have much trouble figuring out the many intuitive things you'll need to do.  Plus there's lots of online help.  If you loved the original Age of Empires, I would say you'll love this too."
25643,"not that bad of a game, could add a multiplayer option where you could team create or something like that, or could add a people pov camera or able to be one of the people/citizens and control them as like a playable character."
25644,One of the best AI included game
25645,Great

And mods. Thousands useful mods."

25654,great game but super addictive!
25655,good game
25656,this is the best simulator for city simulation i would say its alot better than simcity
25657,"Since EA has abdicated the Maxis throne, this French game is the best city sim in the world. Let's be real. Love and light gaymers."
25658,Played this game for free.. is there any way steam can refund my time?
25659,"I give this game two middle fingers for being the next least-friendly thing to productivity software while being fun.
Whoever didn't fund or ignored the UX team deserves to be fired. TL;DR: console-first design and mediocre usability ruins this game.

Pros:
- Watching your city come to life is satisfying. Each building detailed in a way [strike]Sim City[/strike] other city-building games miss.
- Many of the more micromanaged stuff is fun [i]but[/i] optional. If you'd like to name every street in your city, you can! Or you can live with generated names.
- Rich zoning options.
- So many mods (fewer than Skyrim, but. . .ya know.)

Cons:
- [b]THERE IS NO UNDO![/b]
- [b]THERE IS NO QUICKSAVE/LOAD![/b]
- It makes you daydream of hotkeys.
- I have spent 2/3rds (or more) time with the [i]MADDENING[/i] road placement.
- 75% of your roads will be one-way, and you will mess up which way you make the road. Which would be okay if there was a [i]UNDO![/i]
- There is no quicksave/load for when make your 500th mistake in the past hour with no undo.
- You can't draw a road/pipe through other roads/pipes? So if you have a grid, you can only create each street/pipe as far as the first one in the way. Really?
- The game has enough realistic mechanics to fool you into logical solutions to your traffic. Hahahahaha!
- There is no ""area"" delete. You have to delete your mistakes one inch of road at a time. T_T
- There is no ""hold shift to draw a square/circle"" for roads/pipes/routes.
- You can't just place a road and drag points into a shape, like an MS Paint line. You need to be a living protractor to use the curved roads tool.
- There are fake adverts in my fake radio.
- Fake tweets need far more diversity or utility."
25660,"I find I still enjoy the game immensely. But, I wouldn't wish it off on any normal, sane person. I know it isn't the case, but of the 1255 playing hours I have, it feels like 1000 of them have been spent watching that silly bird go around in a circle."
25661,GOOD GAME VERY FUN BUT SCREEN IS BLUE HJELP
25662,"One of my FAVORITE games, with mods the game is always changing."
25663,bitch dis game was fuckn expensive cz all d dlcs
25664,I will bulldoze everyone's house if they continue complaining about being sick
25665,"INITIAL REVIEW:
This game is great. I'm an hour in and everyone has left my city, I am thousands of dollars in debt, and people are really pissed off, but I am absolutely loving it! I can totally see myself pouring countless hours into this game without even realizing it. This is sim city in the modern day, and it is incredible. [99 min on record at initial review time]"
25666,would play this game for hours on end
25667,"Good game, good price (currentely) i love it!"
25668,"Honestly, this is a much better game that the Sim City series. There is alot more freedom when it comes to the creation of your city and a much better way to fix the problems that you have created based on the evolution of the city. All-in-all there is a natural order to this game and things can be fixed alot easier."
25669,Mantap ooo ging
25670,i mean i got it for free so i think its good
25671,its rly fun
25672,"i built an amazing city, saved, and then lost everything"
25673,eeeee
25674,Probably the most addictive game ever
25675,very nice
25676,The game is fun and well designed.

25682,Amazing city building game but takes time
25683,"i LOVE THIS GAME, it has so many interesting DLCs and logistics and graphics are amazing."
25684,"This game has big guy with big city. Next time, make sure you are doing what you said you were doing. I might be kinder to you."
25685,This game is my favourite one as I am very interested in City Building genre. It's relaxing and fun to play with some challenges for me. You can expand your experience as long as you can afford with many DLCs and Mods. Tbh this game is the best game I've ever played in my life :)
25686,i make my town of tighina. i make house of neighbor Pripyat Bulbimca and my house. very sad i am done in 2 minute i now watch our houses and sometime build electricity on acident
25687,"cities skylines? more like, chyah - there's a skyline in my city. she took the kids"
25688,big rock fall from sky people run and hide build again throw rock again
25689,"Right now it is on sale once again. And once again the DLC price is 18x the price of the base game. Yes! DLC price tag for my region currently is EIGHTEEN TIMES MORE than the base game! It should not be like this!

And with all DLC materials, INCLUDING the current 50% discount, the price of this game is still higher than pretty much most of modern AAA games. And if we were to talk about the price without a discount, that price tag is just being exceptionally stupid. Pretty much the same situation as Sims-4.

Highly discourage support of such greedy Devs and Publishers. The inadequate pricing policy is pretty much the main reason video games piracy will never go away.

I like the game, and the idea, and the genre, but I will never buy it simply because for me it is exceptionally stupid when I have to pay almost 20x times more to unlock the content."
25690,yes
25691,yea the best game whit no russians lamo
25692,this game is a waste of time it took me 7 hours to figure the game out and now they wont give me refund do not recommend this game it is boring
25693,gtrttt
25694,"I love building cities. This game is fantastic!

https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2622311244"
25695,so good
25696,I love this game!
25697,all good
25698,its good
25699,"The base game reminds me much of how Skyrim was a great start for modding.  Be aware though, the base game, by itself, is rudimentary without the DLCs and mods."
25700,good good very good
25701,"omgaming
"
25702,"Honestly, I love city building games, and Cities: Skylines would have to be the one that reigns at the top of that list. Nearly everything about this game is perfect.
If you love city building games, then this is the game for you."
25703,Its a great strategy and city management  game.
25704,"Nice game, had fun, until I finally see that the fucking policy not appearing bug isnt fixed yet, 5 years isnt enough Paradox ?"
25705,"after obtaining a mental crisis from this game, i can now proudly say, i managed to waste 24 hours on it in one day, but, this is no achivment, because i can see people doing this, for an entire fucking week."
25706,very great game good graphics but i took a while to get to know stuff i would like them to add a tutorial
25707,Tons of fun cant stop playing it but some dlcs are just to expensive
25708,i love watching people suffer in my city
25709,"good and creative game
"
25710,"No. 1 City builder currently out there. If you loved the old sim city titles, get it. DLCs recommended are the ones with the positive reviews obviously"
25711,fun
25712,"It's like Sim City, but actually challenging. Love it!"
25713,NICE
25714,i am soooo hooked on this game. it brings my imagination to life. Big time
25715,I just bought this game from Steam and it doesn't work. I installed it and when the game loads it crashes. So disappointed!
25716,This is like a much more streamlined SimCity
25717,"Great game, even better with mods."
25718,Great Game
25719,great game played by not so great player
25720,Very good!
25721,"tutorial at the beginning of the game is very unclear,making it harder for a new player..

for example , i made a nice place living city,nice balance between all aspects like health,education,water,etc.then,instanly so many people got sick in my city,so,i made few medical center more.but even more more people get sick...then i search on youtube,turned out that the water is polluted and u have to make building for water purifier or sumthing like that,then when i want to build the water purifier,its still locked because i havent reach a certain population to make this water purifier...

so far im lil bit disappointed and this game is overpriced imo,,lucky enough i bought this game when it was 75% discount"
25722,funni
25723,it's pretty good
25724,game
25725,Now that an awesome game!
25726,nice~
25727,"City Skylines is that game you play after a long week of work to relax your mind. The amount of detail put into this game is astonishing and the possibilities are endless! The base game is well worth the price and there are lots of features that will entertain you without buying a single expansion. This being said, they sure add some spice to the game! Also, the community has built nice mods for it if you're into that.

I'd definitely recommend City Skylines if you love the genre of game!"
25728,Really good game!
25729,really nice
25730,"Amazing, hours and hours of fun for anyone liking this type of game. It isnt perfect but so much community support and cheap DLCs its awesome. I usually hate DLCs but giving a few dollars for extra hours of gameplay is really ok for me, changes the whole game dynamic"
25731,Good sim for building a city.
25732,Its great
25733,very very good much fun
25734,"Incredibly chill game, good for relaxing after a long day of whatever you're doing;\."
25735,Im loving it
25736,Worth it
25737,.
25738,pog game
25739,It's a fun game. Managing the traffic is hard but it is a fun and rewarding experience!
25740,Its a Paradox game
25741,I make people chop down trees.
25742,yes
25743,"this game gives you freedom to mess around with crazy traffic and streets. this game is VERY interesting, therefore I will recommend this to everybody that can buy it."
25744,It's pretty epic
25745,Infinetely Entertaining
25746,The best 30$ and 40+ hours I've ever wasted
25747,MODS
25748,"Feels more like a drug than a game. Definitively addictive!
I struggled a lot at the beginning and still haven't figured transportation more advanced than bus lines, but the fun is there!
The city creator is quite elaborate, and the video and graphics are truly impressive. One can just stop and contemplate.

As I am not a competitive gamer, this slow, pleasurable flow fits my needs perfectly. A game to enjoy and feel good!"
25749,build city
25750,"fun game, unlimited money mod is fun"
25751,"GREAT GAME !
Best city building/management game to date..."
25752,Hi
25753,Not bad.
25754,"wonderful ex
"
25755,"good ennit
"
25756,very good
25757,"This game is downright relaxing to play casually to be honest, I didn't expect much and wanted to buy and play it out of boredom and to just be creative but it actually drew me in quickly. I don't have much time put into it and still learning all of the controls but even so I find this game to be really good to play."
25758,nice chilling game
25759,"Amazing game in vanilla, but once you add mods and assets it becomes one of the greatest city building games!"
25760,Everything
25761,"It's so chill, best nerve calmer. 8/10"
25762,There's no tutorial.
25763,"It is good, but watch the time when playing"
25764,fun
25765,"Wanted it for a while before I got it. I do not regret buying this game, its very fun."
25766,love this game matey!!!!
25767,"Very very amusing game.
I've been playing it for 3 hours even without any DLC. Really kept me amused.
Buy all of it's DLCs if you wanna play more."
25768,i love it. thanks to two youtubers that got me hooked to the game
25769,is good and fun
25770,>:)
25771,-
25772,Great Game
25773,dont waste ur money its not worth it
25774,Good Times!
25775,"Fun game, kills hours and hours of your day and night. :)"
25776,The game should be less bulky. Even Autocad doesn't put this much pressure on cpu & gpu. optimize for smoother experience on mid-range systems. even 12gb of ram is incapable to run it.
25777,"The game is fun, addicting and with a couple of DLC's it's a perfect city building simulator. I love it and you deff should buy it."
25778,I love playing this game it so fun
25779,Not bad.
25780,"I accidentally made my whole city drink their own sewage, killing 20,000 of them. 

oops"
25781,Don't normally play city builders but I tried this one because of the good reviews. I was not disappointed. I became totally hooked on growing my city and constantly tweaking the transport system to prevent complete gridlock.
25782,nice
25783,not recommended
25784,"jeg elsker bare når de begynder at skide så meget at man begynder at pumpe deres egen lort op som drikkevand :-)
"
25785,"Years of updates and still MASSIVE AI pathing issues. You have 6 lanes and a 90 degree left turn? All the traffic will try to fit in a singular left most lane and not use any of the other 5 lanes. Absolutely unacceptable, very disappointed (yes I know some mods can fix this)"
25786,Great game. I have over 500 hours of game play.  I have mods up the wazoo!  I also have all the DLC's. Hats off to the programmers and designers! Thank U
25787,Very good
25788,"Dude Ngl this game is fun as, i have 93 hours of gameplay and have 200 on my other pc, this game slaps, get it, you wont regret it"
25789,"Cities: Skylines
cons:
slow game.
lack of instructions.
requires micromanagement.

sucks.
Free Week 2-9-2021 to 2-15-2021
"
25790,Better than simcity
25791,Best city builder in a long time
25792,"This game is really good, but fuck they're just coping EA with these dlc's.
Just because of that most of the people will pirate it and get every single dlc for free, it doesn't worth the money :/


"
25793,"I started out playing this game on Xbox and I was absolutely blown away at how advanced this game is compared to the other city building games I've played. The mod support on the PC version of this game is also insane, allowing me to recreate cities or take inspiration from other cities and combine them all into one. I've logged in over 5 hours on PC and over 20 hours on Xbox and I can truly say that I never get bored of playing this game."
25794,nice
25795,"Better, Harder, Faster, Traffic got jammed"
25796,fun :)
25797,"It's a cool game, but I didn't really play for long. The in-game tutorial never taught me how to give my citizens water so everyone died of dehydration."
25798,Better than online school
25799,This game is actually a good game but because of paradox interactive i am no longer able to play it it keep trying to install the paradox launcher v2 even though I already had the thing installed I have spent the last two hours trying any fix I have found online but none of them work so keep that in mind if you are looking to buy any game published by paradox interactive
25800,Its like playing sim city. Except it doesn't suck. I really felt like i was playing sim city 2000. Which was my all time favorite. I can't remember the last time I played a city builder. That i lost hours of time. 10/10
25801,Nice Game Create Your City And Enjoy!
25802,Must have game!
25803,great game
25804,"not that fun, enjoyed other games more :P"
25805,what a game this is
25806,good city builder. i like it. hope you can do better.
25807,it is fun
25808,"This is epic, if you ask me why I would say why not try it out!"
25809,Amazing!
25810,"After playing this game, I knew that I chose the wrong major in college."
25811,"Good game, very entertaining, swag music. its a paradox game however so if you want the DLC better pay up"

25814,"A really good builder game. Smooth, nice graphics, efficient user interface."
25815,Fantastic game
25816,Cool game
25817,"Ever Since I bought this game. I have not part myself from it. Its been 5 years or 6 years, and the game mechanics of city building just takes my breath away every time there is a new update available. 

GREAT GAME, GREAT WORK, SHOUT OUT TO THE DEVELOPERS!!!"
25818,very nice
25819,Amazing details
25820,Used to love this game. Downloaded it again after a while and now it requires a 3rd party launcher with a sign up. Won't be playing this anymore.
25821,bu oyun güzel
25822,the sim city we wanted
25823,very good game
25824,Excellent
25825,Would recommend this
25826,ye
25827,Good Game.
25828,"Great game, highly recommend, especially if it goes on sale"
25829,anddd how tf do you have a successful city?
25830,best runs smooth really great workshop nonstop building fun
25831,Very fun relaxing game (if you can build the road properly).
25832,"i am 200,000 dollars in debt on my best city because i raised the taxes by 1%"
25833,"I wanted to make an extended review about it, but I couldn't give a damn just like the dev does not give one about you.

I live in the philippines, and this game does not have a regional pricing at all, meanwhile, they follow the same Sims formula by selling you a cheap base game stripped of everything, and sell the rest as DLC over time. To the point where it become so many, your wallet cry.

Talking about regional pricing, all the DLC and the game end up costing me the same price as if I put 7 months of my income into it.
To give you an idea if you are from the US, with the same money to earning calculation, it would cost you about 9000 usd as a part time employee.

So, yes you are not forced to buy everything, yes the game is not as fun without everything, yes there is mod, but game dev need to seriously stop depending on free labor to add content to their game.

Game is alright, wanna be sim city with better graphic but worse gameplay. You have no issue earning money, no real challenge, and the vanilla experience without mods or dlc is just as you see my time of playing, quite shallow.

I played the ""full"" experience somewhere else, and eventually stopped bothering all together. Great game, greedy dev, and people defending those tactic, claiming devs have to go eat, not knowing what it is like to live in porverty should move to one of our country and see how it feel like to work under 105F for 60 hours a week, and do that for 7 months until you can buy one ""full"" game. 

Even with the current discount, I can't afford the missing dlc. Poor people have no rights for entertainment. Having fun on a computer is only meant for rich and first world countries."
25834,"Great city building game.

DLC is too expensive.

Funny even when all goes wrong.

I recommend it!"
25835,"Games does not run smooth, and can crash really often. Not a solid game as in performance wise. Also Modding does not help this game at all, it causes the game to crash even more."
25836,"fuck your DLC paradox. I love quite a few of your games, but this is egregious. you're EA now, happy?"
25837,It'sgood
25838,"good game
"
25839,fun.
25840,"Ultimate City Sim to date. Coming from someone who isn't much into resource management games, this one is really fun. Inspires creativity in what you build as well as how you want to play it, loads of replay value. DLC is a tad overpriced, much like the Sims, the main game is pretty bare bones and can be boring, if you can get the add-ons on sale it's worth it."
25841,yes
25842,sheeeit its aight
25843,"Paradox released an update that included their own launcher and updated EULA, that states they are collecting data (and share with their affiliates)."
25844,ye
25845,"I am a massive fan of the genre of city building. From the classic greats like Sim City, to the more recent released, Cities: Skylines Is just as good, or even better. 
        -  Worth the price

Graphics and Performance
        -  Game runs great
        -  Looks great
        - Not many performance bugs you'll get some bugs but not a lot"
25846,This game is very relaxing if you play it correct
25847,"Already pissed off before I start the game. Lots of terms and conditions and you can't sync your progress in Steam, they want you to make a separate account."
25848,is good
25849,"ITS AMAZING 
if you love sim city and looking for something new to play this is the game for you 
love planing game game for..."
25850,GOOD
25851,Xd
25852,"good. worth buying
"
25853,"You can mess with people's lives and make an obscene amount of money at the same time, also it's much better than SimCity. Even without the DLCs, you can make a beautifully-planned thriving city (or fail trying).

Oh, and did I mention it's by far better than SimCity?

Top Tip: Bring some RAM."
25854,"epic game if you like building citys buy the natural disaster dlc if you want to destroy the city you build and buy the mass transit if you want to build monorails, ferrys and basiclly more transport"
25855,"you build roads, rage that your roads are shit, make a new city, fuck roads up again, get mad, make new city and repeat the cycle."
25856,"Great ""complicated"" game, with a lot of features and great mod community.
You can spend hours and hours building your city, and once it has been build, you just spend hours and hours perfecting the balance and traffic.

All in all 10/10 game"
25857,"yeah, frick (fuck) sim city"
25858,"If you have a good computer Its pretty fun. My computer isn't so great so it takes about 2 hours to load which i'm half fine with, The problem is that when it loads the game crashes which sucks. I like the customizabilty and the lighting is actually adorable. I really wanted this game and when I bought it I wasn't that impressed but its pretty cool for a building game.. ACTUALLY it can be awesome with some mods and a decent pc. recommend if you're into building and sand box type games."
25859,este juego es muy bueno tiene buenas mecanicas y todo esta conectado en pocas palabras lo malo es que va un poco lag en portatiles como la mia xd
25860,Best Game for City Planners!
25861,Awesome
25862,It's fun
25863,"Totally hooked on this game! Absolutely recommend it if you are into ""realistic"" city builders. I'm still a noob with only one week playing this game (obsessively ^^"") but the potential it seems to have is almost endless. Definitely worth the buy, and already saving some money to buy more DLCs! :D
(I'll write another comment in a couple of months just to register my impression of the game over time)
Cheers, stay safe & have fun!"
25864,A nice way to build communities
25865,"Absolutely beautiful game. But, until they fix the traffic AI, this game will never be good. I shouldn't have to exploit a terrible AI design that literally cannot recognize when there are other usable lanes."
25866,"If Sim City was done right. Addicting and fun! Music gets a little repetitive, but that's the only negative I can think of. Very worth whatever price it's at! And the add-ons are really fun too"
25867,"I've played this game for probably 200+ hours and I'm still fucking terrible at it.

10/10"
25868,"i've driven a lot so i know roads, and these roads are darn realistic. A+"
25869,BAD GAME

25871,not perfect but still worth playing!
25872,HAVE THE BEST DLC

25874,please make this game free so hugo will stop asking me to get it for him
25875,
25876,very good
25877,The game is best if you have hardware capable of running all of the DLCs and top mods enabled. Perfect game for ADHD brains 10/10
25878,Fun game I like
25879,"I was a huge SimCity fan for most of my life. Cities Skylines is the new standard I will compare future city builders to. Frankly, at least for now, it's the only city builder worth playing as far as I'm concerned."
25880,"A fantastic game with many ways to play.  Create sprawling cities and have fun experimenting or go for missions and unlock achievements.  This is a game that a person can keep coming back to.  Arguably the best city builder ever made.  Others have tried and some continue to try, but no one has yet to create a city builder that's this much fun and customizable."
25881,"If you thought city builders could not get better than they were, you've not played this."
25882,"love it
"
25883,Look no further! This is THE ultimate city-builder! The workshop has great content too!
25884,"Upon adding new Expansions the game becomes more and more challenging, something I really appreciate."
25885,good gem
25886,Absolutely amazing. Great game if you enjoy city building games. A little costly with DLCs and such but other than that I 100% recommend it.
25887,Endless fun and endless potential building the dream city!
25888,"i realy love this game , in life i make art but this is also super creative ."
25889,yes
25890,grrgr
25891,"Now that there are expansions and a super invested modding community to help fix some troubelsome mechanics withe the game, I would definitely recommend this game."
25892,"yes
"
25893,IF YOU LIKE AND ENJOY SIMULATION GAMES THIS IS THE ONE THAT WILL JUST KEEP ON GIVING. IF YOU PURCHASE THE MOD PACKS WITH THE GAME YOU CAN LITERALLY LOSE ALL OF YOUR TIME TO THIS GAME BUILDING MANY CITIES.
25894,"Great Game To Own A City
Great Game To Expand Your City
Great Game To Take Care Of Citizens

This Game Is Really Fun And Really Great It Does Not Have The Best Graphic But It Is Calming And Relaxing In A Way.

Hope You Enjoy Cities Skylines"

25904,good city building game
25905,"Nice and relaxing city builder.  It would be better if the stock game incorporated some of the mods that make vanilla so much better (like traffic manager).

It is easy to become hooked on mods and workshop apps and downloading a wrong-un can scrap your game so be warned"

25907,All I have to say is.... AWESOME Sim all around.
25908,Nice game
25909,Its Great!

25911,Yes it's a very good city builder game.
25912,"I had a lot of fun playing until I realized I had to take out a second mortgage on my imaginary house just to buy the DLC. Too many dev's thinking their game is God's gift to earth charging through the roof. This game costs more than a AAA title with 25 DLC's and it's just a few reskins and new sound effects. Pretty shady business practice and I can't support it. Tired of these developers removing features from the base game so they can sell it back to their ""customer"".  Last time I purchase from this team."
25913,4/5
25914,"Really fun tycoon game, but the terrain tools are a bit tricky to get right, but over all really fun and detailed, a must play for sure."
25915,"if you want a simple to understand City simulation game with almost infinite possibilities and tonnes of replay value then you've come to the right place. but if you want to take it a few steps further and go insane with skyscrapers and tsunamis you better get your wallet ready. its a stellar game out of the box and ive sunk countless hours into it with only 2 DLCs , but like every paradox game the parts that make it perfect are trapped behind paywalls"

25928,If you like games like simcity or the like you will love this game. This is a solo person game as of right now. You will lose hours of your life playing this game. Base game is super fun the DLC just make it that much better. Highly recommend.

Especially the traffic fix episodes, but builds are good as well.  Not just one way to fix any single issue, and as you grow, things change as they would in any growing simulation.  Or should."
25933,"Отличный симулятор постройки города, в котором можешь воспроизвести все свои фантазии, хоть построй город в форме мужского полового органа (если нечем заняться), ибо игра требует докупить длс, потому что с ними играется намного интереснее"
25934,love it
25935,i have no life
25936,"time to commit crimes against humanity in local city sandbox game
"
25937,I heartily recommend this game. The integration of the Steam Workshop and the additional mods makes this even more fun to play in between and even for hours. One gets in quickly and can quickly see his own city grow and prosper.
25938,this game is amazing. but it crashes alot.
25939,Best city builder since sim city2000
25940,This is a great city builder! Highly recommended.
25941,Haven't touched since 2017 because I don't know what i'm doing but I hear it's good
25942,good
25943,"Okay so I think it's time to update my review. 

I really love this game and can't put it down. If you have unlimited time to fill, BUY THIS GAME. It is useful if you are bored, *Quarantine* and it's a step up from Simcity 2013 and TheoTown. I also think that if you like tycoon/management games you will LOVE this one. So, onto the pros and cons.

-Pros:
-It's an ultimate time sink
-Extensive modding support
-HUUUUGE Cities, you will get lost in them.
-The ability to stare your Cims down to follow them, which is really,really cool.
-The BEST city-building game I have EVER played.

Cons:
-Waste management is a bit iffy, I find that in my latest city it was a real challenge getting it to work, so DO YOUR RESEARCH.
-No recycling centre included, you need Green Cities to have that.
-Not enough tools to manage traffic. You need a mod like TM:PE

So it might look like the cons are a lot, but trust me they are little things in an almost PERFECT game. I also love the graphics. so yeah, buy it."
25944,i love this game!
25945,Honestly so cool. totally worth it.
25946,"Most realistic City Builder-Simulation Game. 
Policy and Zoning parts spark my joy."
25947,"I really can't express how much fun i've had playing Cities Skylines, its just insanely challenging and fun. If you like money management and tycoon games, get it."
25948,I love this city builder so much. I don't even have any DLC yet and it's already great. Can't wait to build up more content!
25949,"Must have game , the best city Sim available"
25950,"The game is good and i like it, it still needs some bug fixies and other stuff but i would recommend it"
25951,"If you love city builders you will enjoy this game.  Even the base game has complexity and beauty to it.  That being said, the game truly shines with the DLC.  Are any of them ""mandatory?"" No.  I would say if you get any DLC you should get Mass Transit.  Adds so much depth and diversity to the cities.  After that I love the Industries DLC.

In summary, go back to my first sentence.  If you like city builders, you will like this game.  Highly recommend."
25952,"after playing the game for several hours. I was asked to re-install it today to start my second session playing this game.. Though the game is already installed and even shows a last play time of yesterday.... still clicking the shortcut on my desktop just starts the downloader /installer.

Never had this problem ever.

So this one gets a thumbs down from me."
25953,Cool game
25954,"Better than Sim City ever was. Sure there are a lot of expansions, but hey. No free lunch."
25955,"瑞典蠢驴快出新扩展包！
你敢出我就敢买 真尼玛好玩"
25956,"After a couple of (nice) hours in this game , i can recommend it to everyone who loves city builders or strategic management games :) .  

PS: Choose your DLCs wisely , not every of them stands for its price..."

Heaps of fun!"
25966,poggers.
25967,"Great game, lots of mods and custom assets available to suit the individual player.
Just note that it can be a bit demanding after installing a few assets/mods"
25968,pretty hard when you dont know what to do
25969,is good
25970,Its a good game just play it right.
25971,good game
25972,"Pros:
- Noice
- Fun to play and stare at what you've done for a whole day in your room lmao

Cons:
- Graphics suc 
- half of mods suck and doesn't even work
- A.I can be wonky
- Error messages are extremely cancerous and doesn't even explain what's the problem
- Chirpy
- Losing your world due to broken mods lmao"

25981,great game!
25982,Played this for 7 hours straight (played 3 last night).
25983,You'll never play SimCity again. Great 3D graphics and an amazing modding community!
25984,fun
25985,Good City Builder
25986,good
25987,"Very little direction to help you get started. Just a frustrating process of watching your money drain at an increasing rate, with no obvious way to resolve it. After starting 6 games and just going broke no matter what I did.. and with no guidance from the game, I quit."
25988,It really makes me feel like a city skyline. 10/10
25989,Cool game!

25991,"its good, i came from xbox, wanting mods. its my favourite game. buy it."
25992,time killer though I am naive
25993,NOOO
25994,= Good
25995,Nice City Builder game
25996,Starting to show its age but still a fun game.
25997,The city builder you always wanted.
25998,Pretty Pog
25999,itsa good
26000,Very good game.
26001,Its good but gets some DLCS
26002,"One of my favourite games, but the DLC costs are unreasonable. How can people NOT turn to illegally obtaining DLC when each individual one ends up costing more than base game? I have not, and will not, illegally obtain DLC, but you have to admit $18.5 is a bit steep each DLC."
26003,gg
26004,yeas
26005,"This game is very much like the sims in that I forget about this game for months at a time and then I wake up in a cold sweat remembering why I spent so much for this game and proceed to spend hours on this game for a week and then repeat. But yeah this game is pretty great, I personally chose to get it on a sale though because it can be a bit expensive for my fellow college peeps but yeah would definitely recommend it!"
26006,I play the game everyonce in a while simply because i get stuck playing for 3 hours at a time so i have to take breaks lol
26007,yes u should buy because you can build any city u want
26008,"BEST CITY SIMULATION!
ALSO : YOU SHOULD TRY SOME 'REALISTIC' MODS from community hub!"
26009,"There are a lot of problems with this game that the creators refuse to even admit to. One of the biggest for whatever reason is water standing high up in the air on saved game starts. Some times water will appear from no where and flood the city and no number of restarts will make it stop unless you go backwards to an earlier save, ruining any work that was done. Land will do this too. 

There also doesnt seem to be a lot of compatibility with mods and when the game updates all kinds of things happen. Generally game crashes. Ive spent many hours working on my maps only to lose them all in the last update then be argued with by tech support. 

Some of these mods should be incorporated into the game because of how immensely important they are."
26010,the best cites building
26011,Brings back memories of Sim City 4. Good level detail and decent learning curve. Hooked for hours
26012,This game is the best thing ever

26016,This game is great. You can cause traffic jams anywhere. 11/10 would recommend.
26017,best
26018,"A spiritual successor to Sim City, this game is entertaining as you try to provide for your city's residents balancing housing, commercial , industry public works including residential sanitation and their transportation needs."
26019,Still one of the best games around. Only complaint is the large price of the DLC packs.
26020,I may have only played 4 hours but this is a great city building game with lots of ways to express your creativity . It contains alot of fun things to mess around with when you are not taking it seriously and when you take it serious then you can also have a ton of fun.
26021,Better than SIM City
26022,It's fun
26023,I like this game very much
26024,super fun game
26025,FUN

26054,This is one of those games that is so addicting I actually don't know if I should recommend it or not. Prepare to stay up too late.
26055,"Nah, I cannot recommend with such DLC policy. The base game is really boring and you need to spend loads of $$$ to buy enough DLCs to make it fun."
26056,Its good and cute.
26057,Fun game.  Very well thought out and requires good problem solving!
26058,"This would be one of the best offline games in history of mankind BUT there’s a shitty launcher that starts before you can play that crashes if you are not connected to the internet :/

This negative review is about the launcher.



The game is good tho.."
26059,building with fun
26060,this game is easy to get lost in. i've had several hours pass by me and not realize it. this game is actually why i ended up building my own pc. got tired of how slow it ran on my outdated laptop.
26061,love this game. for me it is one who can play for hours on end and not know it
26062,relaxing way of closing the day
26063,hi
26064,gud geam
26065,Just play for the Synthetic Dawn Radio station to be fair.
26066,"While it is fun to build your city, i got bored of it very fast, this could be me being an idiot"
26067,"I'd recommend this game but it can be hard to get started. Build roads, supply them with water and electricity first. Power jumps from building to building so zone your areas around a centre initially."
26068,"good game, use mods for an extended experience"
26069,fun and even better with mods good city building sim.
26070,"it  is the only game i play and i love it
"
26071,Legit
26072,the game is entertaining until your city gets so big you can't handle it
26073,God graphics
26074,this game is great but you must careful if u want add some mod and asset because can make a bug or glitch
26075,"Beautiful city simulator would recommend to anyone, Cheers"
26076,Can't recommend this game enough. A city builder on a n epic scale this is the true successor to SimsCity after EA imploded the entire franchise. It looks dauntingly expensive given it and all the dlc garner a £100+ price tag but I would highly recommend buying one of the bundles as I did and pick up extra dlc as you get into the game. A spectacular game that you can easily lose yourself in for hours. If you have any love for city builder games you absolutely need to play Cities: Skylines.
26077,"The game is awesome but sadly it crashes a lot on my PC.
Prbly the best city building game"
26078,"godd game
"
26079,"Cities Skylines can be reightfully be considered the successor to Sim City 4 from 2003. With the game tasking the player into the development of a city with a variety of tools at their disposal. I would first like to commend the developers for allowing a player to micromanage areas of their city to create stunning areas all created by hand. Along with the game presenting dynamic traffic systems. Something unheard of by their predecessors. By forcing the player to  deal with traffic, police, fire and medicinal issues as units in the map area of effects of games such as Sim City 3000. 

If you are a fan of dynamic city builders. Then Cities Skylines is a game you must tried as it raised the bar in the city builder genre."
26080,"Fun city builder, large cities.  Expansions could be priced better though."
26081,I like the mods and assets of the game.
26082,"The best city building game out there, would recommend"
26083,"What can I say? Well,  my playtime really says it all. I can get so lost in the creativity of city building that this game offers. The modding community is second to none and is what has kept me playing for as long as I have. The DLC in my opinion make the game way more robust all around by each providing their own unique charms to the city building process which I love. I give this game a 10/10 for its ability to suck me in and keep me coming back to make new cities."
26084,Very fun!
26085,really fun jsut worse than factorio!
26086,"I like this game, simply because it can be addicting at times, even if you have had the game for a while. It is nearly impossible to get bored of this game, unless you are known to get bored of things. The game might feel confusing and frustrating to new players, but you get the hang of it really fast. Just make sure your PC can handle this game before you get it, because it uses a lot of my video ram. I recommend this game, unless you don't like building cities or don't want to pay 30 bucks."
26087,This game kills time and is so much fun
26088,Epic!
26089,"The best in its category (Because there's no competition)

the vanilla game is kinda boring without DLCs (FUCK PARADOX)

_______

Update : 

this game is not fun without mods too, the problem is mods break the game,, the game becomes unplayable; errors everywhere just because you downloaded a single prop or two !! ,, your save game file will break with time !! imagine wasting your time on a save file then it breaks!

__

this game doesn't respect your time nor your wallet with the endless DLCs it has,I hope CS2 gets better optimization and modding system 
if you don't want headaches just don't download mods and buy every DLC like an idiot and waste your time until your pc can't run the save file anymore because of the poor optimization"

26101,Yeah Fantastic! Get it bruv.
26102,yea its
26103,if you don’t like having fun it’s pretty good
26104,I hope to have more games like this....
26105,it wont launch
26106,This game is the best followup to SimCity 4 with plenty of downloadable mods.  If you want to learn the game there are plenty of tutorial videos through YouTube.
26107,awesome
26108,"Privacy notice on macOS:

26109,I like flooding cities.
26110,"This is a very great game. I encourage others to play it. The only thing is, you shouldn't play on laptop because of the graphics and how much storage memory it takes. Best for a Desktop Computer. Overall I love this game and others should to. I have one request for a update. You should all plan on making some realistic things for console such as Parking lots for residential, a mod panel for inserting the Console mods provided without having to wait until a building upgrades and builds.

Thank you.
Youtuber: Visible Vibes"
26111,This game is amazing and I wasn't expecting mod support
26112,only thing i dont like is all the dlc you have to buy but besides that its fun on a bun
26113,I flooded a city with doo doo and caused an economic crisis by doing so 12/10
26114,"Very Nice Game to play! The only issue in my opinion is that I payed £22 for it and then I had to pay £5-£15 for DLC's which in my opinion can be overpriced, anyone can disagree but It's my view, apart from the slight DLC issue I have no further issue with this game and think its better than many of the other games I've played including Sim City Build It etc."
26115,good...
26116,"If you like city building games such as Simcity franchise, this is a must have. Highly recommend Cities Skylines."
26117,It's Awesome!
26118,my playtime must be 1000+ hours including my playtime on disk.
26119,"
very good city building game. The people in your city do have their fate! They can sit in jail, work and get old! The game has small bugs with the agents' logic, but it does not change the fact that the game is a great simulation."
26120,"Very nice game, purchased for 30$, I can say it's totally worth it's money. But I personally can't play it for long at a time."
26121,The best city building game ever. PERIOD.
26122,"Engrossing, beautiful, time-wastingly good fun"
26123,good for every one but best if your wanting to be a engineer but still lots of fun
26124,Its fun
26125,good game :)
26126,loved much
26127,Game is very super great!  Many time spended making cities more good.  Very good!  Play often.  Play long.  Simplicity of objective belies the complexity of the underlying system's capabilities and interoperability.
26128,REALLY good game not going to lie
26129,"Be mayor for life!
It's like what you remember sim city being from back in the day but it's actually good.
Small learning curve but fun once you get it"
26130,Just Buy It Ok.
26131,You won't find a better city builder anywhere else. This is the best one ever made. Unless Cities: Skylines 2 comes out (which honestly is never gonna happen so just get this one it's so good).
26132,blaah
26133,the best city sim so far
26134,Great city building game. Nothing bad to say.
26135,"My town died due to an excessive poop problem.

10/10 would recommend."
26136,Real good. Sim city 4 was one of my favorite games as a kid and this really feels like a new better version of that
26137,Hard game depending on how smart you are.
26138,Love it!  Challenging and lots to do!
26139,Awesome game!!  Be prepared to kill a lot of time playing.
26140,"This game could should be recognized as the world's first actual working time machine, because every time I fire it up, 12 hours go by in a matter of minutes. I try to avoid playing it too often."
26141,"With mods, game is amazing -- vanilla is okay.  Either way, you still need a pretty souped-up PC to use high graphics/details, even in 2021.  And if you want the DLC, shop online, since you can get most/all of them for 50% off or more these days."
26142,"It is 2021. Games should have autosave enabled by default in 2021.

Note: This is an update to a previous review where I didn't realize that the game even had an autosave function because it is 2021 and it wasn't enabled by default and I assumed, wrongly, that any developer who had made that decision had idiotically forgone the vital feature altogether. That was my mistake. I promise to do better."
26143,I play vanilla version and it really gives you so much fun. I really recommend this to anyone who wants a fun challenge.
26144,"very good

26145,"Reviewing games on basis of HOH/Deaf accessibility.

i have 125k citizens in Butt City now so it was very worth it"
26147,"so fun

26148,"Its a fun game to build your own city, manage things, make decisions. You can also use this to learn things like financial management, time management and world rules."
26149,fun
26150,Good game!
26151,"Pretty fun game, would reccomend mods though
"
26152,"This game is amazing. You get to build a city, manage a city and mod it."
26153,good
26154,ummm yeah love it
26155,"This is a really fun city builder, despite having had it for almost a year now I still don't get bored of playing this game. The game has a good amount of support for mods (eg. custom buildings,cars,scripts, maps,ect.) which means that players can make their own structures, maps and modifications for the game. The only bad thing I will say is that the game is a little overpriced I'd recommend that you get it when its on offer. One bad thing about the game is there are an excessive amount  amount of DLC's (Downloadable content) that are usually around €10-€12 each will add extend and add on different things for the game i.e. transport, parks, industry, ect. The game doesn't get much updates anymore but with the amount of mods there are it doesn't really need any. So to finish this review I'd recommend this game, but I'd recommend that you get it while it's on offer."
26156,very great game i really loved it i really want to buy it my self since i somehow got it for free for a week love it buy it yourself
26157,build
26158,Very good
26159,"If you play vanilla, there is a limit to how far you can get. It seems to happen around 55,000 population where, unless you did grid cities, you start bleeding population and can't get the next tile unlocked. People who put a lot of time into their cities on vanilla settings (no mods, no DLC) will have a very slow climb.

I've played this game since launch, very casually, with about half a dozen reliable mods and several dozen custom maps. My population is around 310k on my main city. Every time new DLC comes out, I binge the game for a while. Unlimited replayability. What Sim City Should've Been. 

Best game in this category. The full experience with mods and DLC will have you planning elaborate 25 square cities for hundreds of hours and begging Biffa to fix your traffic problems.

Do recommend."
26160,One of my favorite games
26161,its good.
26162,Good video game.
26163,I found this game by accident and it so oddly amazing and fun.
26164,"Having played every Simcity game ever made on their release dates I can honestly say that Cities:Skylines has taken the limitations of the Simcity franchise and gave us all, what we knew all along, was truly possible with a city building sim.

The modding capabilities are amazing. The devs are amazing. I highly recommend this game."
26165,uhhhhhhhhhhhh it is very fun and can build places and in dont know what to say
26166,"This is one of my favourite games of all time. I can get stuck in for hours just micro managing my tram lines, perfecting traffic flow or just making the scenery appealing. And with the massive amount of mods and assets there is always something new to do."
26167,"Pros:
+ Massive graphics and rich details
+ Realistic simulation elements
+ Challenging gameplay with different difficulty settings
+ Variety of buildings
+ Many customization options
+ Easy to use user interface
+ Extremely high repetition value

Cons:
- Graphics can be more realistic
- Terrain cannot be changed during the actual game
- Many things are not done.

Without modes, this game is fun to create a functional and profitable city, but you will not be immersed in a realistic-looking city. With modes, however, this game becomes a model train set without any restrictions."

26170,Best City Building Game ever!
26171,Fun! You build a city :)
26172,Best city builder I've come across! Base game is a little generic but invest in DLC and modding and you have a game with near infinite replayability and plenty of options to optimize your city... or not. If you're looking for a city builder game and wondering whether this is the one the answer is yes.
26173,"Everything is awesome, from the amazing radio stations to the random giraffes running around your city."
26174,"If you're looking to get lost in a peaceful game, for hours, without realizing how much time has passed, this is for you."
26175,This game is amazing. Definetly reccomend it.
26176,All I'm saying is Cities Skylines >>>> SimCity
26177,"Cities: Skylines is a relaxing city building game with a huge modding community. It's fun and a good way to chill and kill time. While there is a lot of DLC, the game is functional in its base form. However, the DLC does add a lot of variety and unique aspects to the gameplay."
26178,Amazing game!
26179,Great city building game!
26180,i made a poop volcano pog
26181,"It's a free and realistic game, letting you build your own civilizations. Most DLCs add so much more contengt, making it a great game. I highly reccommend."
26182,Fun and expasnive game with great mods
26183,"After playing sincity for years, this game is much more interactive and addict. Very good game, finally one that we can freely build."
26184,Dobra gierka
26185,i agree
26186,"I love how realistic the game looks and how detailed the game is. However the game is missing a few things atleast, but overall it's an awesome game."
26187,This game is great for persons living with OCD. It has helped me to regulate my emotions quite a bit.
26188,Its good
26189,cool
26190,This is so much fun if you like City Builder games! Just make sure your machine has A LOOOOT of RAM lmaooo
26191,Relaly shines where SimCity fell off. The new standard in City creator/manager.
26192,Pretty fun
26193,Yum
26194,"Everything!, is what every SIm City franchise game after SimCity4 ought to be."
26195,"Yes but get mods
"
26196,Good game.
26197,"Great game loved the ability to be creative!
It is everything Sim city 2013 wishes it could have been!"
26198,"It's no secret that this game is frustrating to play without a smattering of 3rd party mods running. It's still fun up to a point, but very limited in end game play without becoming a modding wizard, which disables achievements.  Ultimately the lackluster vehicle AI is this game's downfall. I have not purchased any of the DLC, nor do I plan to, for this reason."
26199,h
26200,good
26201,Its one of those games where you go on for an hour one night and suddenly the birds are singing outside. Some mods are super useful!
26202,"Yeah, really good game. Lots of creative freedom. Can pretty much make any city in the world given the right mods. 10/10, would recommend."
26203,good yes get get get.
26204,"Great game, planning on playing this more."
26205,Cool game. I like chilling and just following my citizens while listening to some podcast or watching something on other monitor.
26206,As a vet with PTSD i can enjoy Paradox & Colossal Order's creation without depression. Thx all staff involved Cities Skylines stands out as all time Greatest City simulation morale booster. I salute you. Please add military Orders i think it would be a great Expansion. Bsafe.
26207,Feels good to be a Mayor who doesn't care for Capitalism but quality of life.
26208,once you get your head around this its fun and spend hours playing it. took us a few videos on you tube to help us with a few things as the tutorial isnt fantastic but we got there in the end. was surprised that the base game is just like a sandbox. all scenarios are extra. was a little disapointed with this.
26209,mantap
26210,well i got this game and immediately said “oh this isn’t a fun as it looks” then proceeded to not leave my desk for 9 hours playing it and once i got some of the DLCs Damn! it’s like playing a whole new game all though the DLCs are a little bit overpriced and should all really be $15 AUD i do not mind as it is still an amazing game 10/10 4.7 stars
26211,"freedom of game mechanics brings you a kinda thing you want to do but can't in reality.
a great joy of watching the settlement you set up blooming.
always did i lose myself somehow just hearing the vehicles honking,raindrops falling or even erratic noise i didn't know where it came from.
i love the cities i made,better better than the one i am in.
it is the game of the lonely.

"
26212,"One of my favorite games




"
26213,i love this game!
26214,this is the embodyment of the best city builder game in the world.
26215,Too much DLC when you fail too easily... I can barely build a city without EVERYTHING failing at once... you Never have enough money for anything. I have to cheat in order to play this game comfortably...
26216,dd
26217,enak bisa jadi walkot
26218,This is the proper spiritual successor to the Sim City franchise.
26219,"Best city building game on the market. I cannot recommend for a few reasons.

Monetization is out of hand. I'm not going to buy 7 DLC packs. It's just not happening.
Steam Workshop implementation isn't very good. Adding and enabling mods and assets is tedious and a little overwhelming, especially when adding content packs.
You need mods for the game to actually work properly. Example, you should get the traffic toggle mod. This is something that SHOULD be in the game, but simply isn't.
Tweeter. Stupid. Hate it.
I have vanilla and euro assets turned off and yet all of my high density residential is ugly euro buildings.

I think this game is a 6/10 vanilla, 7/10 with workshop, but it's still not quite there in terms of satisfaction and city building. Sim City was a great springboard, but this game really need to restructure how some of the systems work."
26220,AMAZING
26221,"Its nice to spend a couple hours relaxing and playing this game to relax your mind if you play it slowly, but if you rush you will destroy your city faster than you can build it up"
26222,extra detail of sims city complicated
26223,play it on lsd and see what madness you make
26224,"Love the game so much, that I focus on transport and making more people in one area. I wish more to be added into the game where it can be the biggest land to build or a bit of war on polities. mostly the airport could be more flexible.
Be came the mayor in the districts and be came president. ;ol 
Still love the game ever since playing the game."
26225,"Love the game, but after paradox came out with the new launcher it crashed. Constantly. so i bought a new pc, same issue, paradox can't fix it and offers lousy customer service asking me to do all kinds of trouble shooting, 12 hours which affected other pc and game settings in my steam library. With no resolve. Several months later I took it upon myself to fix it. The game periodically crashes with the same error. But not as much as it used to. no thanks to paradox
"
26226,good g8me
26227,"fun, and better than simcity..."
26228,Great game! Love it!
26229,E
26230,Very fun game.
26231,"As an absolute time thief, this game is fantastic. Literally the second you feel like its time to turn it off and go to sleep, you'll reach a new milestone and all of a sudden your to do list needs urgent attention again. 

I dont advise paying full price for it, wait until its on sale, since the full price seems a bit steep, and absolutely do not pay full price for the dlc. But, if you can pick it up on sale for cheap enough, this game is a fantastic investment"
26232,SPRAWL MAKES ME BAWL - MY FRIEND HENRY
26233,"With the addition of Mods, Cities Skylines is bordering on being a video game world developer rather than simply a city simulation game.  The possibilities are endless."
26234,gooooooooooooooooooood
26235,it is perfect for spare time
26236,Addictive and quite deep. Very good modding
26237,"Buy it, its good"
26238,great game
26239,"Good game, but I regret buying due to the Paradox EULA. I guess its existence in my library is a constant reminder to check a games EULA before buying. I will never be install it again"
26240,"I wont post positive for anyone to have to sign up for pardox anything, im signed into steam, why do I have to sign into your paradox whatever you are to play a game I bought on steam. Its my  game that I payed for. I shouldnt need to sign on to anything of yours to play the game I bought on steam. this is not how things should work. I will not pay for anything else from paradox and will tell others not too either.  When does it stop. How many things must I have to sign in too to play a game."
26241,"If you like solving a constant barrage of 100 little problems, you will be stuck on this for hours"
26242,sim city on steroids
26243,Is so addictive and it is easy to learn
26244,10/10 would build crappy city again
26245,"Wow, finally a city simulation that does not sell you dlc packages to repair a bugged system instead of simply fixing the bug. I guess we know who I am talking about and their unsolvable city suffocating traffic problem.

If you want to be able to go into city planning in detail, this game is for you. If you just want to play casually, this is also the game for you

Best. City-Building-Game. Ever !!!"
26246,fun.
26247,Man this game isnt for me. Living in Mombasa has ruined my creativity but I guess if you live somewhere better maybe you will enjoy the game
26248,good
26249,"very nice
"
26250,Very love. much good. me likes.
26251,"cheezus..... as a trans who is transitioning to a black man, I love this mutzpa. i build cities with juevos, and lock up all the oppersors of mi biblotecha. My name will be senior marcus el blacko when transitioned and theiis game make mi feel eeh tu lavos muy grande y hermanos. 

I love this game and highly reccommend to all of the oppressed. spread your wings and biblotecha"
26252,gud gaem
26253,"It's good
Not for old PCs
I deleted for that
Still good though"
26254,e
26255,Great game.
26256,can be frustraiting but so worth it when everything starts going right
26257,best city builder ever.
26258,"Really enjoyed playing this game been at it for months. My only draw backs are 1. traffic is completely unmanageable the worst pain is a 6 lane highway and they decide to only use one lane even at the toll booth 2. cannot control the revenue for tolls, public transport and so on 3. the Sim will complain about a lack of something let's say police even though the police station is right next door 4. Traffic will be 60% even though there's nothing on the roads and traffic is moving all over the city. Overall I don't think a functioning city is actually possible."
26259,ITS GOOD
26260,Runs pretty well on my 11 year old laptop. No idea how.
26261,"if you turn the turkey simulation, it becomes more enjoyable"
26262,"Amzing, Addictive Game, Like building city so much"
26263,Great game.
26264,"The game has a limit. When it reaches that point, yes it squeezes. But that limit is all about your imagination. I definitely don't think you need dlc.


ゲームには限界があります。それがそのポイントに達するとき、はい、それは圧迫します。しかし、その限界はすべてあなたの想像力に関するものです。私は間違いなくあなたがDLCを必要としないと思います。"
26265,Satisfies the need to replicate a mad overpass you have driven on
26266,"[h1]Cities: Skylines,  It's like buying a Car without an Engine[/h1]
I really enjoy playing games like this, I grew up playing the Sim City games.  I would spend hours making a city , only to have it burn down or fall apart from a earthquake... But that's what saves are for.

Obviously it more [b]Detailed[/b] and graphically more [b]Beautiful[/b] compared to the older sim city games . So this is a no brainier, and had to buy it. Overall it's a lot of fun and will keep  you entertained for hours. 

But it has major flaw...That makes it not worth the full price, and I really urge you to
only buy it on [b]Steam Sale[/b], or with a Discount Code.

[b]* Core Game Feature ""Natural Disasters""[/b] - Is a [b]PAID DLC.[/b] 
Yeah and it's [b]Half[/b], [u]$14.99[/u] of the [u]$29.99[/u]  [b]Base Game! [/b]

Really?  That's pretty greedy of the developer to not include natural disasters.
Or if it had not made it into the base game before it launched, you could at least
give it to the players for Free.  Then (Charge) for the rest, or future DLC.

[b]If you wanted to F me, you could have just taken me to dinner first...[/b]

But seriously, overall I have played quite a while, and have yet to any [b]Game Breaking[/b] bugs. But it feels like a ""Empty Shell"" without the looming Disasters hanging over your city... 

And can be boring without it while you wait for growth. [6/10] because they are greedy for not including Disasters."
26267,GREAT GAME GREAT TIME
26268,"Cities: Skylines is definitely the best City sim on the market by far. I thoroughly enjoy making Cities in this game but somehow end up spending more time browsing the workshop. I love that there are so many different ways to play this game and there is no single ""correct"" way. Everyone can have fun in their own style which is exactly what a sandbox should be able to provide. The game has had countless DLC added but as a whole I think C:S is beginning to show its age. Perhaps time for a new iteration of C:S. Take my money."
26269,Best city builder game ever.
26270,What Sim City 5 should have been. great mods too
26271,i have no fucking clue how to play this game
26272,This game is awesome
26273,"Do you have very few hours in the day to have fun?
Do you have a list of plenty of productive things to do?
Do you have better things to do than play a simulation game?
THEN THIS GAME IS FOR YOU!
Waste hundreds of hours building a city only to realise: 'Nah, I can do better' and start again with all of your new found skills from your first playthrough
Download a single DLC and build a whole city focused around it, then get bored and buy a new DLC and do the same thing all over again!
Seriously though, this game has so much replayability.  The DLC all add something worthwhile for a decent price when on sale.  The community is very active and there is a HUUUGE amount of workshop content."
26274,Fun game.
26275,"Awesome game, I've always loved sim city and when I got back into PC gaming a few years ago after a long hiatus, I tried cities over on origin access and loved it, I actually prefer it in many ways to the newest sim city, it seems a bit more realistic and less ""cartooney"" lol"
26276,This game is absolutely fantastic.
26277,"super
"
26278,"Always enjoyed these types of games, but this one feels and seems like to me a cut above the rest."
26279,Maybe.
26280,"good graphic for city builder game, easy to learn, minor bugs, will spend your time. if you vanila player i suggest getting some DLC's."
26281,goood
26282,fun
26283,"A great game, lots of fun

sadly they followed the EA approach with DLC.
So I wish I could give a neutral review rather than negative."
26284,"Fantastic city builder, easy to learn but difficult to master!"
26285,This Game is probably the Best City-Builder game I've ever played!
26286,"It's ridiculous that a 5 year old game is still as relevant and it's developer is as active as they were on launch day.
Not all DLC are great or needed, but who cares if the base game alone is still a great buy."
26287,"Fun game, pretty realistic as far as I can tell"
26288,good
26289,"Detailed and innovative experience, particularly with mods."
26290,fun
26291,this game so fit with my hobby that love to build something... enjoy the time and create a city really make me realaxed.. recommend it
26292,cool
26293,its good but difficult
26294,best game ever. full stop.
26295,All the good stuffs
26296,"This game is (right now) just the best alternative to actually building miniature scenery. I started Vanilla, learned how the basics work, and then started using mods, which basically make Cities another game."
26297,"Almost 900 hours into the game and have all DLC except for the radio stations (obviously)

This game is AMAZING. I love building cities and stalking people around to see what they are doing and up to."
26298,"Are you a take it easy, macro manager who just likes to expand, plonk stuff down and hope for the best?  No problems!
How about a freakish micro-manager who insists on dictating the terms of your industry and universities, the functioning of every traffic junction or even the naming of every street?  Well this has you covered too!
What can I say?  The best city management game ever created."
26299,"Cities: Skylines has to be one of my favourite relaxing game i play. I am someone who spends most of my time playing really competitive fps, and i find that Cities just allows me to take a step back and just enjoy games with out getting too into it. But then it gets addictive. I paid for it on my Xbox, but the PC version is just so much better thanks to the great community mods. great game, 100% recommend it if you want to just be by yourself."
26300,34
26301,"I usually have a massive erection when I play this game, but that shouldn't necessarily cloud my judgment. 10/10 would bang again. We're still talking about cheap hookers right?????"

26303,JABANA
26304,city go  up and up and up
26305,"objectively better sim city
like dont even fight me on this its just sim city but good
dont buy deluxe edition though
its an extra 10 bucks and all you get is being able to put the statue of liberty in your city"

26312,"Quite a good game, easy to get going with it too."
26313,it pretty cool i like
26314,building cities is SICK buy this game
26315,An incredible city builder with continual input from both the Devs and a robust modding community.
26316,Sick and tired of traffic. Kills all the joy.
26317,cool  game
26318,"great game
"
26319,fun and addicting for adults
26320,"by far, the best city management game."
26321,"very enjoyable game to play, its a slower type of game play that allows you to walk away from the computer from time to time with no real downside once setup correctly."
26322,"One of my best purchases on Steam. If you like(ed) SimCity, imagine that on some high grade steroids."

26350,"great, fun, addicting, best city building game out there 10/10"
26351,Its a much better SimCity.  thats it
26352,its pretty good u make cities n shit
26353,"My second most played Steam game. An excellent thirst-quencher for anyone's inner god-complex. This game is best for players who like general city builders, and anyone who likes building cities will get an absolute hoot out of the HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS of items on the workshop that you can download designed by other players, for other players. 

//Workshop
Want a space factory? Check out that one over there that looks like a hydroponics farm!
Want to make your city look like an old roaring 20's boom town? Check out that pack of 1920's style buildings over there.
Hell, want to completely change the way the game works? Want to take complete control of your traffic like you never thought imaginable in vanilla? Want to abandon the zoning demand and weird time-doesn't-align-with-skybox feature in favor of an overhaul that makes C:S acknowledge the existence of nighttime and weekends? Want to start off on a lonely planet rich in resources and oxygen somewhere in a galaxy far far away? WANT TO BUILT 50 GIGANTIC TOBLERONE MONUMENTS IN THE CENTER OF YOUR CITY?! Every single thing I've mentioned is a real building or mod you can find on the workshop. From cool looking police HQ's to mods that completely overhaul the land-purchase mechanics of the game, the workshop has virtually everything you could think you'd want to add to your city.

//Traffic Management
So, if you like to manage traffic, this game is great. With the addition of the traffic management tools on the workshop, you can pretty much modify and build cities with deadlocked traffic jams to flow with as much efficiency as a rose petal's unfurling is silent. That really only applies to roads, though, which is why now I'm going to make the last section, which is about:

//*Transport* Management
See, the only thing this game *isn't* quite good for is general transport management. While the managing road traffic and the general city-building aspect of this game generally carries a 9/10 in my opinion, the other forms of transport are a little neglected, and general transportation systems aren't very touched on in this game. AKA If you're looking for a 3D version of OpenTTD, this ain't it, but I'd recommend checking it out anyway because the traffic management definitely scratches my itch for transportation obsessions.

Tl;dr: this is a 3D city-building and traffic management game. Its community is f***ing INSANE in a beautiful way so this game has pretty much infinite customization and replay value. Transport is a little neglected, but that's probably because this is NOT a transport tycoon game (don't get this game if you just want a 3D version of OpenTTD.) 9.99 recurring/10."
26354,"After years playing Simcity, I think Skylines is an awesome city builder!"
26355,This game is really fun once you get a hang of it. I had to start and scrap a few cities in the beginning just to get practice in how all of this works. I highly recommend some of the DLC's and mods that go along with it. I really is a fun game!
26356,"Fun game, wish you could interact more with the citizens and the night time is kinda annoying since I can't see where I'm building. Very much reccommend watching RT Game's cities skylines series and of course getting the natural disaster dlc :)"
26357,"very addicted,,"

26365,"Great game. Don't think i've played any city type games (sim city etc) or anything before this, but it's very well made and fun. All the workshop content is also great. Nice and relaxing relaxing (most the time until everyone in your city is dying and the roads are clogged because i didn't build the roads well :D oops)"
26366,s
26367,good
26368,"gud
"
26369,So many options and tons of mods make this game incredibly fun for many hours.
26370,The game is crazy. Great fun in city builder. Sometimes it can even turn out to be difficult because many times I lost the whole city due to simple stupidity. I recommend
26371,"King of the city building genre.
Why is it the best? GAMEPLAY and MODDABILITY/EXTENDABILITY!

The base game is somewhat bland by today's standards. But with all the DLC content and mechanics - it shines.

Of course, it is suffering today from low performance and being built on an outdated version of the unity engine.
16 GB RAM and 4GB VRAM can be limiting if you're into hundreds of mod assets (and trust me - there are actually THOUSANDS you'd wanna install...)

A wish for the future? Leave almost everything as is, just update the technical foundation (unity 2021, DX12/Vulkan, you get it).

26372,Simcity but 1000x better
26373,"One of the most amazing games I've ever played.  if you enjoy city builder/management games, this game will leave you with endless hours of play.  The community is highly active with creating new content/workshoppable content for this franchise."
26374,"Amazing city builder, would recomend this over simcity. however some downsides are its better with DLC, IE you gotta buy more dlc's"
26375,"made city, made people happy, made money, good gaem"
26376,"Absolutely in love with city building games and even for it's age, this game is still so much fun.  The community content makes it so much more interesting as well.  I would highly recommend this to anyone who enjoys city building games"
26377,best game ever made just need to add 2 components first is weather changing factor and second is fuel for cars.
26378,Great game.
26379,"Cities Skylines continues to be an absolute pleasure to play. No game breaking bugs, no backwards updates, just a good sweet clean play every time I launch it. 

A wonderful and entrancing reprieve from whatever chaos is going on in your own real life city, this is a game that truly allows you to get lost for hours at a time without frustration.  And while it's a simulator - allowing granular management of production quarters, bus lines, metro systems, taxis, water/sewer, population densities, entertainment districts and oh so much more - it never lets you forget that what you're playing is a game, and a very fun game at that.

From it's low-key syncopated music styling to it's beautifully done graphics and lighting, it really draws you into the world and will have you desiring the next population milestone, the next completed project, the next finished highway, the next, the next, the next....  Similar to the ""one more turn"" philosophy of a more lofty world conquering sim we all know and love, Cities Skylines will have you going to bed late at night and counting the minutes until you're playing again.

The developers have decided to release DLC's that are often too minor an addition when compared to the price point... And the truth is the “bang-for-your-buck” appeal for many of these additions is dismal at best - so my only warning would be to please do your research before purchasing these at full price.  If there's something of particular interest to you, read up on the actual content provided, check the reviews, and act accordingly.  However, at sale prices these DLC's are great to snatch up - but only when heavily discounted.

What is of particularly note here is that even with the additional content still making money for the developers, they actively encourage an EXTREMELY healthy modding community to flourish.  This game has so much community content it's dizzying, and I personally love it.  It's a great way to personalise your experience any which way you see fit, and better than just being robust, it's all free and easy to work with.  

The community that has sprung up around this game is very healthy and helpful, and it's just been an absolute pleasure to play this game, across multiple platforms, for years on end.  I look forward to many more!  

Beautiful game, wonderful mechanics, fantastic gameplay, intuitive controls, gorgeous lighting, captivating sound design, and endless possibilities - Definitely a full hearty recommendation from this guy."
26380,this game is all consuming. do not think you can put it on for an hour and walk away...
26381,"If you enjoyed Simcity growing up, you'll love this game. The game is still kind of pricey, and the DLC is also expensive, but in my opinion the game is worth it. There is a lot of content in this game and the DLC. The vanilla game is great, but the mods on the workshop take it to a new level. It's fun when your city runs perfectly and looks great, but it's also fun when your traffic is at a standstill, your city is on fire, and the trash is piling up. 

I also feel like it's a very relaxing game to unwind with. I highly recommend this game."
26382,Good city sim sunk 8 hours in what felt like 3
26383,"obsessed with this its a problem... its so addictive, filling out the map fixing intersections to stop traffic jams all of the expansion packs add new depths to the game and dont get me started on what the cc and mods do. please buy this if youre thinking about it. <3"
26384,it's fun
26385,roads n stuff they're cool

26390,this game is AMAZING!  so worth the money!
26391,Complex and challenging simulation of managing multiple factors. Incredible attention to detail and accuracy. The TRUE successor to SimCity.
26392,"This game does a decent job of simulating civil engineering and urban planning. This game succeeds where EA failed in creating a successor to Sim City 4. This is the kind of game where you can easily spend several hours improving small details in your city. All in all, an 8/10."
26393,Good graphics and fun gameplay can spend a whole day playing get bored but always want to come back after a couple more days
26394,"I enjoyed the city

26406,"FUN, take your time to build your own city. In the beginning it's best to watch some videos since the game isn't easy"
26407,Leagues beyond Sim City. This is the city builder you want!
26408,"I love this game for it's creativity! You can build all kinds of random junk in this game, which is exactly what I intend to do. I also love how there are so many things you can do, like make your own residental areas, edit the landform, and being able to make your city grow, If I could play this for days, I would! It may lag at times, but that is only because of the many awesome things inside this game!"
26409,My favorite city builder
26410,best city builder dont @

26421,"The ease to play this game is good, the radio stations have a fantastic range of genres, can spend hours easily if this is your type of game"
26422,"City Skylines is with no hesitation, the best city building game out there. The possibility’s are endless. It’s practically Minecraft if Minecraft was a city building game. Do anything, build a super high tech city full of skyscrapers, or build a small little town. Then connect the places in your city with roads, paths, buses, trains, planes and more, with no limits or suggestions, just free building. Watch your city grow from a place no one knows about to a Megacity with over 1 million people. Even little details like where people and cars are going are implemented. And if you get bored, despite all those features, there is a world full of mods made by the community. So, stop reading by review, go ahead and buy it right now!"

26444,"I like it! It is pretty cool to build you'r own world. In the bas game ther are some things missing that I would consider to be nececary for a good gameplay, or what I like. That is no problem because the shere number of mods for this game is so big, you will find it. From extra trypes of roads to buildings to traffic mods, it's all out there. I think it's worth the money. If you have a semy decent computer it will run ok. On my crappy laptop with core i3 8th gen and 8gb of ram it runs satifyingly smooth enough for my liking on low settings. I have always had a crappy laptop so it's ok for me..."

26453,gud
26454,I think it is an creativity game with almost no limits! (with using mods)

26461,i played this game for 11 hours in one day got a city to max level and havent played it since but its fun
26462,Great fun game for any city bulding folk out there
26463,"Been playing this game on and off since release all the way back March 2015. It can undoubtedly be called the best city builder of the last decade. Simple to get away with, time will become an illusion when playing. What feels like 30 minutes might turn out to be a 3 hour session. Meanwhile the workshop has thousands of mods, buildings, maps, etc to make the game more personalized. Additionally there are a ton of DLC's to expand your game with, which I highly recommend to pick up when in sale.

The bad parts? The music is quite annoying and gets repetitive very quickly, so I tend to just turn it off and listen to my own. Meanwhile gameplay wise, once you've build your first city the game does lose quite a bit of its charm. While it does have a certain replayability factor, trying to not get another grid-like city can be challenging at times, since the margin between profitability and money-pit can be very thin in the beginning."
26464,aaa
26465,"great fun, good to experiment with mods but vanilla is awesome on its own, worth the time and money"
26466,"Micromanaging go brrrrrr

One of the most detailed, intricate, fun, and downright beautiful city builders out there. Did you know this game was made in Unity? I didnt until recently! 
yeah! This game is made in unity! Not an in house Paradox game engine! 

Its fun, its addictive, its creative, and most of all, its better than SimCity

Only issue: it is still a Paradox game, meaning late game is laggy because...Well its Paradox."
26467,Yes
26468,very solid city builder. 9/10 (make sure you add some essential mods for even more fun)
26469,BILD SITTYS N SHIT
26470,"terrible game, lost all my gameplay because auto save isn't enabled by default"
26471,YES

26477,This game is fantastic! Very intricate and detailed.  Great graphics and great platform.
26478,"way more detailed then sim city, very addictive!"
26479,"This is the best city builder i have played and, will continue to play. The hours I have put into this game can speak for how much playability this game has."
26480,"This game is the best city builder I've ever played, and to think it's made by the same company that brought you the overall okay-ish games of Victoria, Hearts of Iron, Crusader Kings, Europa Universalis, and Imparator: Rome. It's the best one of them all, in my opinion."
26481,E
26482,"It isn't perfect, but once you download some of the (essential) mods like traffic control and stuff, it becomes allot of fun."
26483,itz cool
26484,Addictive. VR please!
26485,Great spiritual successor to SimCity 4 since the new Sim City failed spectacularly.
26486,"It's one of those games that I binge until I get tired of, then end up coming back a few months later to do it again.  If you're a new player, it'll take some time to get used to - every city sim has its quirks, and how everything interacts is something you have to learn.  Highly recommend looking up some YouTube plays to get a feel - ""City Planner Plays City Builders"" and Biffa for a start, don't think everything they do is perfect, but it's great to learn tricks and common pitfalls.

I personally wouldn't play without mods (from steam workshop).  For adding significant game mechanics: Traffic Manager, Move It, Roundabout Builder, Loading Screen Mod, Improved Public Transit 2, etc.  For improved UI: Show It!, Watch It!, and most of the ""___ It!"" series by Keallu.  Then you can find all sorts of great buildings and other assets from others, depending on what you want your city to look like."
26487,Anyone who likes city builders will like this game.
26488,"The best city-building game I have ever played. My city has grown to more than 200,000 population over the past two years. Nowadays just hanging out in my vibrant city gives me great hope during the covid lockdowns..."
26489,"While I've enjoyed the experience for the most part, and put a fair few hours in, I'm going to give this one a negative review for a couple of major reasons:

1. The DLC policy is cancerous in a way that Paradox is taking to new heights (CK2, Stellaris, HOI...). 
2. The game quickly becomes a traffic manager as soon as any major population size is met, and it's really tedious. The AI for traffic is pretty bad and it really relies on mods to try and fix it. A game should be accentuated by mods, not rely on it to fix it.
3. It's all too utopian, which I know is a bit of weird criticism. The original SimCity series felt far grungier, with gritty, melancholy music, and the potential for whole swathes of dismal city blocks that looked like something out of the suburbs of Mega-City One. Given Simcity 2000 was release in the early 90's, there's a definite vibe of the 80's depression era. City games *should* have slumps, depressions, crime, social issues, challenges in terms of society and culture. Not once, no matter how big my city get in CS, did it feel like my city was anything more than a larger version of Pleasantville full of happily medicated cims. 

That said, the game does look *amazing* and the radio is generally pretty excellent (though some of it is locked behind the DLC paywall). 
Not an ""avoid like the plague"" review, still a lot of fun, but the more I played the more I realised not want I really wanted from a city builder game."
26490,Recommend
26491,"this game is fun, I recommend."
26492,"The base game works well for beginners, but once you get more into it I would recommend downloading mods/assets from the workshop. The base game can be limiting at times, especially when it comes to traffic and road types."
26493,all
26494,its ok

You will spend most of your time managing traffic and planning for it.
In any case this is definitely a good game and well worth the price."

26527,"I was a long time SimCity player, I stopped playing after the software aged out.  Cities Skylines is a fitting successor with similar gameplay but improved graphics and game speed. It runs great on my  2020 Macmini."
26528,GG
26529,"Have you ever found yourself 15 hours into a game and realized that the you 14 hours ago had no clue what they were doing? Cities: Skylines is one of those games that encourages your to iterate - to start again and apply what you've already learned to the next city. It's an addictive, beautiful, complex yet simple enough, city-builder that is the pinnacle of the genre as it stands (circa 2021ish). The DLC is nice to have, not necessary to have and the gameplay is fluid throughout. Some strategies clearly work better than others, but you can create the city of your dreams... or nightmares if you don't manage traffic well enough in the early game. The workshop is alive and well with mods, textures, maps and much more if you feel that the vanilla experience needs just a little extra spice. Overall, the game is a 9/10 but I can't quite explain the exact problems that detract it, it's just not quite *perfect*, but definitely worth a buy!"
26530,poop
26531,"Very fun game; made me knowledgeable in yelling at my city council meetings, despite their best efforts to keep me out."
26532,Best city sim apart from Sc3k. Epic and an instant classic.
26533,Best city building game I've played for sure. Very fun to play and isn't too much of a grind.
26534,"fun game, unfortunately the paradox formula is nothing but a customer milking machine and the game crashes too often, more than Bethesda games.

On top of that, the forced installation of Paradox Launcher prohibits players to play offline on a SINGLEPLAYER GAME. Why you may ask? As always, data recollection. Paradox Launcher recollects all available personal data and guess what? IT FUCKING SELLS IT TO THIRD PARTY SERVICES (Surprise!! Tencent is an investor!!)
It sells your data such as:
-Name
-Age
-Sex
-IP address and hardware information
-Physical Address deduced by Geo-location
-Browsing Story (yes it has access to third party applications on your computer)
So you can guess the rest of data it collects.

Such is the clown world, give us your data and money and you get a license to play the game (reminder you don't really own Steam games). Never forget the 2030 motto, you will own nothing, you have no privacy and life has never been better."
26535,"Best unity game ever.

Tweety needs to die"
26536,VERY FUN game and is very creative and realistic.
26537,"amazing time passeer
"
26538,"If you grew up with the original Sim City (like Sim City 2000) then you'll love this game which takes that similar city building style and adds so much more. The amount of CC out there is amazing and makes even the base game alone well worth it. It can be easy or challenging depending on your set up (traffic is often very frustrating and probably my only complaint, still not completely unrealistic either). It's a great way to relax (or even get serious about if you want to go full city planner) and I've spent a stupid amount of time on this game. A warning. It may not look like much but the game can be very taxing on your CPU, especially with CC installed. It easily gets up to 80% on mine (sometimes as high as 96%) and I have a i7-9700K so it's not an old processor, so if you go CC crazy like me it can cause the game to lag and to crash at times, just a warning. Base game still takes more processing power than one excepts but it's not something most news computers can't handle. Anyway other than those small issues it's a very fun city simulation game and if you're looking for something similar to SimCities hay-day it's certainly up to par."
26539,mmmm meteor go brrrrr
26540,its  good
26541,amazing game
26542,"A highly addictive city builder. Building a city throughout many days is truly an amazing experience. Would definitely suggest buying a few DLCs as well, because they will make the game even more enjoyable."

Fill the flatbread shell with seasoned beef, a three-cheese blend, lettuce, tomatoes, and reduced fat sour cream, and you get a Dante-esque culinary anomaly. You get the Chalupa supreme."
26546,"Very good game, strongly recommend it"
26547,"
Beatiful"
26548,"Not like its counterpart, this game give us more chance to modify, its completely sandbox cities builder.
You can do anything with this game, the building models, maps, even the game logic it self with downloadable mods.
Really recommended"
26549,"you build 
"
26550,I just love this game.
26551,"Brilliant game, at the end of the day the biggest challenge is to make traffic flow smooth, and its really satisfying when it does. Perfect game to play while listening to a podcast. It may not require a lot of hardware, but as your city gets bigger and bigger, your frames will descend"
26552,thumbs up
26553,"It can be a little tricky to get to grips with the finer details of the game, but once you get the hang of it, it's easy to lose hours and hours of your life!"
26554,"highly recommend this game, gameplay gets even better with mods."
26555,love it ;)
26556,"Really should be called traffic management simulator imo.
Apart from the constant managing of roads, it's a pretty fun city builder. Definitely a step up from simcity in terms of city size/content."
26557,"Decent city sim all around.  I'm revisiting the game to see how it plays with a fast NVMe M.2 drive, Ryzen 7 3700X and a GTX 3060Ti.  My last Windows 10 system was held down with an old RX 580 as it was a dual boot Hackintosh setup. The game has a healthy modding community which breathes new life into the environment."
26558,Modding makes this game stand out BUT the bas game is incomplete without DLCs and should not stand as separate product.
26559,"Since nobody reads these reviews most of the time I will just get to the point; if you like city building sims (you probably do if you are here) then you should already own this game. The base game alone has so much content it's staggering and that is before you even venture to the Steam Workshop and check out the incredible work modders have done. 

Between mods and the base game the potential time suck here is infinite, it really is a must have for any city sim fan and I have seen this on sale for next to nothing. Even at full price it is still worth it regardless of its age. 

If you are a city sim building fan and you don't buy this, you're a dribbling idiot!"
26560,"Has to be one of the best city simulation games ever created, especially with the addition of the steam workshop. Highly recommend!"
26561,"game is great, playing it quite often but there are some minor bugs which makes gaming experience irrelevant, but in general is very good game and it is worth to buy and try. In my opinion number one on the market in this genre."
26562,"Best city building game so far, could be better but still best."
26563,"wish it had multiplayer then this would be amazing, other than that its a good game :)"

26574,"If you like City Building Sims, this is the non-EA version. (EA ruined everything Will Wright created.) A lot of the DLC is really more option, especially the radio stations. Save them for a sale."
26575,Amazing! never gets old
26576,"Being my first city sim/builder/management game, I have no basis for comparison within the genre, but I'd like to praise the game anyway. Don't be afraid to look up some tutorials if you just can't fix an issue or there isn't enough information provided (pro tip: the fault likely lies in your terrible infrastructure design). 

Pros + : general accessibility, balanced gameplay loop, generous customization potential, mod community, consistent sense of progression, can construct intentional ghettos and whatnot (with a sense of imagination, or maybe a 

Cons - : poor optimization, reused 'tweets'/music/textures/auto-names, DLC paywall for a significant amount of content, addicting (:

If you've been on the fence about this game or this genre, join in, you'll have some fun!"

26585,its good
26586,"It's a great time waster with a good rate of progression for newbies and experts alike. If you loved the old SimCity games, or were disappointed by the newest SimCity game, this will definitely scratch that itch. I haven't ran into too many bugs at all and I started playing this when it was first released. The RNG of the disasters can really mess with development but helps provide some challenge. In 5 days of 2 hour plays I got an earthquake in the middle of my small city, a tsunami that flooded my whole city after recovering from the quake, a meteor that destroyed my just built airport, another meteor that destroyed my power plants after moving them for efficiency, and a sink hole destroyed my freshly rebuilt airport. But after all that I had the best disaster response infrastructure ever built! ;) I've definitely gotten more than my money's worth out of it and recommend it."

Focusing on trafic is my (and probably most peoples) favorite task. Also trying to build cities in a way that optimizes on most parameters (but still, trafic is probably the main concern). I feel like there is a lot of love in this game - you can see the focus has been on making a great game rather than making the most amount of money."
26602,SO FUN

26609,"At this point, I dream of intersections and metro routes. I still suck at this game. 11/10"
26610,The best part about this game is the custom mods and assets. I do have most of the DLC's but with the mod community you could play this game in a wide variety of fashions without them. You can play the way it was designed or as more from a design fashion.

26627,"I purchased skylines a while back to support a game I knew would get even better in the future. I have returned to the game to see $180 of additional content they want me to buy for what they feel is the completed game. Charging this amount of money for a surprisingly outdated engine that really shows 6 years later is not good practice.

I choose not to play the base game and give you a bad review:)"
26628,It's a great playground. Get some ideas and implement them.
26629,"Love this game. Honestly ever DLC is worth it lots of game content, you can spend hours on this game."
26630,"Awesome game, very fun with great community maps and mods"

26633,very fun
26634,"I have created class warfare in the palm of my hands, 

Turning on infinite money and just playing malicious god is very enjoyable"
26635,"This is a good city builder but at half a decade old it shows its age. They haven't made any updates to the engine or base game despite newer hardware being available. 

The game props itself up with the modding community. The most obvious example being the need for a mod to buy more than 8 building tiles (which is at most 20 percent of the visible map.) BigCity on the workshop by sankai expands this to 25 tiles. Despite mods being abundant, the developers locked borderline essentials behind DLC. Parklife and Game Day come to the top of my head as egregious examples. It's up to $200 for the bundle with all current DLC. As far as I am concerned, if the DLC costs twice as much as the base game, it's time for a new game. No one likes throwing money at software from 2016.

Adding in the launcher is an obvious issue that others have covered better than I could. There are now more intriguing options by smaller developers that are better priced, take advantage of newer hardware, and do not rely on predatory DLC. I do not recommend paying full-price for this game in 2021."
26636,"This is a really fun, addictive city building sim. I never played sim city but I could imagine this game takes after those when they were at their best."
26637,Cities!
26638,great gane
26639,It's a really fun game and I love that it has mod support
26640,Fantastic game
26641,Easy to play hard to win
26642,"I have a few main issues with the game.
Lets start with...

[h1] DLC's that are 10% function 90% fluff [/h1]

Most of the older DLC's for the game are pretty much this.
[list]
[*] 8 Things you dont need or care about.
[*] 1 Function you actually want.
[/list]
For example
[list]
[*] People got the ""After Dark"" dlc because it had bicycles. Not new features for bicycles, it [b] added [/b] bicycles...
[*] People got the ""Snowfall"" dlc because it had Trams, but the rest of the content was locked behind special maps that have permanent winter, not a season system like the name ""Snow [b] Fall [/b] "" suggests.
[*] People got the ""mass transit"" dlc because it had monorails. (though it was abit less lacking than the ones above)
[/list]
Some are good, but alot are just like this.
And if you REALLY want to burn your money, buy one of the radio DLC which only adds a few peices of music... In a game that doesent even need music...


[h1] Performance [/h1]

While i certainly dont know all the behind the scenes logic of how the game works.
I have observed that the vehicles in the game show all the signs of using a VERY brute force method of simulating their behavior.
Because all the vehicles, pedestrains, trains and [b] everything that moves, [/b] (from now on it will be refered to as an ""agent"") can move completely freely.
They arent on a road, path or track. They are following a road, path or track.
This is very obvious when using the Move It mod to move roads around, the agents dont follow along with the roads movements, they stay where they are in the world and try to move to where they should be.

This is horribly innefficent, the computer has to calculate exactly where in the world an agent is, every frame, for all agents.
If the game used local positioning, where agents know what lane of a road, path or track its on, and how far along that lane it is. Because then we dont have to deal with as many spacial cordinates, hitboxes to check if there is a vehicle infront of it or any other useless information that doesent benefit the simulation.


[h1] Accuracy [/h1]

The update that came when the ""Mass Transit"" dlc released did fix some of the AI's problems.
But the AI is still horribly american. Jokes aside, everyone in C;S drives like a fucking lunatic.
super quick lane changes, diving across 5 lanes at the last second and not yeilding for people who have the right of way at an intersection are just the ones that stick out in my mind.

They can also only change lanes at nodes between segments of roads, not an issue in an unmodded city where they will just dive across 5 lanes in the middle of the intersection to get into the correct lane. But if you use mods to make people drive abit more sensably through intersections. then people will have issues taking certain routes (which is what causes most of the issues people have with busses taking weird routes.)

The developers also seem to have a case of ""US-Defaultism"". the lack of yeild signs, traffic lights that dont give a shit about anything that isent a car, and the super euclidian zoning. Just reeks of americas car centric city planning.
(which is super ironic sense the developers are Finnish and the publisher is Swedish...)
and while this doesent make the simulation itself less accurate, it does make the game as a whole less accurate, sense the base game only lets you realisticaly build a city as if it had to get approval by a set of 50, 80 year old american city planners.


[h1] Rellying on mods to an extreme degree [/h1]

People often make jokes that Bethesda has mod makers fix their games for them. but while their games are still really good without mods.
Cities Skylines is only an okay game without mods. Its only really popular because it has such excelent mods that turn the game into such an amazing city builder. (If we ignore all the issues i just mentioned.....)

Now, the mods are fucking amazing. TM:PE fixes the whole issue with the game only letting you build a city like an 80 year old american, Network Extensions added ontop lets you build amazing highways and intersections for your city, FPS booster helps to optimise the game further. (ironic) And asset mods helps to make your city not look like a copy pasted peice of shit.
But the fact you basically need these types of mods for the game to be as good as people say it, and the fact that the developers highly recomend that you use these mods. Just goes to show that the developers just havent cared much for adding these sorts of things to the game.


[h1] Conclusion [/h1]

Do i recomend the game? Not really, it basically has a monopoly on this genre currently. While game series like tropico and... Uh... Something else? ... Exist, they dont let you build an actual huge city with proper transport infrastructure.
But i wouldent say that you should buy it just because its your only option, that just makes the issue worse.
But if its on a really good sale than i would say it might be worth it to give it a go.

But dont hope for the base game to improve at all, it has basicaly been stagnent for the past 2 years."
26643,Great graphics and traffic tools. Best city simulation to date. However quite weak in realistic consideration of aesthetic considerations i.e. quality of life and environment. No capacity for multi use zoning or alternative societal priorities.
26644,"It's pretty good. This game isn't too demanding so you should be able to run it, easily with a newer laptop. The game play is interesting to say the least. I like the game, however there are some issues with death waves that can ruin the enjoyment of the game."
26645,best game ever
26646,.
26647,Good game and certainly an update from the old SimCity series.  Beautiful graphics and many creative options.
26648,"A 5 star sim builder with a community to back it up. thoroughly enjoyed every aspect of the game and spent a good 200+ hours trying to build the perfect city on the many maps available. The community support especially from the thousands of mods available to make your city just the way to like blows my mind.

Highly recommend giving it a go."
26649,"Great for chill

26650,I'd tell you what the game is like but it is still loading...
26651,"Great game, traffic can be a pain for the newcommers.
Plenty of mods to keep the game interesting and tailor the game to your liking. Although the mods can also be confusing for new players...even for returning players. The mods change a heap whenever I am away from the game for a few months.

Great game overall. Well worth the money."

26680,"[h1]Cities: Skylines; the best RAM-munching city sim you will ever play. (Reviewing full game + DLCs.)[/h1]
I am a massive fan of the genre of city building. From the classic greats like Sim City, to the more recent released, Cities: Skylines stands head and shoulder above the rest.

[u]Game play[/u]
C:S is a massive city building sim with so many micromanagement opportunities your OCD will purr. You'll start by creating districts of residential neighbourhoods for your ""happy"" people to live, of which they'll constantly harass you via Chipper to be a better mayor. You'll then choose what route of power you'll provide, depending on what DLCs you have available. You can watch as you burn a hole in the ozone through coal, oil, or be upstanding and provide green energy. Same goes for water supplies and sewage; Want to watch a group of tourists swim in the sewage your city produces? Crack on.
It doesn't just stop there. Rubbish, recycling, postal services, healthcare, fire protection, crime prevention, education; you have complete control over how you want to govern. Each section allows an in-depth management in supply and demand, giving you full control. This has been expanded ten-fold with DLCs such as Campus, allowing you to tailor your own universities to give one example.
Create jobs through office specialisations, retail areas, or offer more lucrative avenues such as specific industries and manufacturing. This has been expanded again by the devs via the Industries DLC, you're able to create massive manufacturing chains starting from raw products, refine them and produce expensive exports to keep you in the black.
One of by biggest joys in the game for me came from travel, and is so important in the game (especially when hitting a high population of 10,000+). You're able to create and manage various routes and different types of transport (again expanded in the DLC ""Mass Transit"") to allow your citizens to freely traverse your city without clogging the main arterial roads of your city. This for me was the most difficult part of the whole game, one that I am still trying to master from well over 200 hours of gameplay.
Lastly, C:S has one of the most active mod developers of any game that I have played. I am using many, many mods and custom assets that allow further improvement to gameplay, more customised buildings, better beautification tools, the list in endless. The active content creators are a joy to watch, giving you new play-style ideas, better ways of implementing tools, etc.

[u]Graphics and Performance[/u]
I'm playing on an (albeit older) i7, with 16GB RAM and an older 4GB graphics card and I am still struggling  to achieve a full 60fps on a medium graphics preset (though I understand this can be down to the amount of custom assets I use), I am perfectly happy playing on this setting for the amount of processing that the game requires. It chews through RAM like you wouldn't believe. Also loading times can also become a burden on lower graphics machines, again especially is using mods.

Pros:
[list]
    [*]Solid, endless gameplay, even without DLCs.
    [*]In depth but user friendly management systems.
    [*]Fantastic custom asset/mod creators/content creators.
[/list]
Cons:
[list]
    [*]If you want to use multiple mods without damaging performance loss, ask your friend at NASA for their spare supercomputer or whatever.
    [*]DLCs are expensive, but worth it (apart from Natural Disasters, the DLC equivilent of a toddler having their sandcastle torn down by a bully)
    [*]The music can be quite annoying and differs in volume depending how zoomed in you are on the map, I personally turned it off.
    [*]The Chipper (the social media presence that allows communication from your population) makes you feel guilty about being a monster.
[/list]

10/10"
26715,good
26716,"Good gameplay, although quite a high learning curve on this game, this game is satisfying and challenging at the same time. The mechanics is broad and wide for a city building game. In addition to some DLC, there also mods that enhance and add more immersion to your game without actually taking the vanilla taste out of it."
26717,The best that urban planning and development has to offer. A lot of content with DLCs (as usual with Paradox) but also with the Steam Workshop you can do a lot here. Definitely better than the last SimCity!

PS. Game runs terrible on mac (BIG OVERHEATING ISSUE)
Runs decent on average laptops (Over heats, with minimal lag)
Really well on desktop PCs (no over heating issue, minimal lag if low spec (obviously))

Hope this helps you!

Used cloud for saving the games. Still no fix. Love the game otherwise.   The airport only allows use of one gate. it should operate more like a real airport.  Roads are still an issue that vehicles favor the right lanes the most and traffic jams are common do to the lack of full use of all lanes.  Lots of bugs.  Seems there is lots of mods which are great but, the functions noted above need to be realistic."
26738,good
26739,"I like all the mods you can use to make it ""better"" but even the base game is a good game to play."

26741,best game ever
26742,I like it enough to play it
26743,Best city game ever
26744,If you like sim city then you'll love this
26745,39 days of my life have been devoted to this game. Best money I ever spent.
26746,"I don't think you really need a review to tell you to play this particular game. If you're reading reviews to decide, you already have."
26747,Much more realistic than Simcities
26748,"I LOVE this game! I have played this game since its' release. I have thousands of hours of play time. It resets every time I upgrade my computer, which is frustrating. I can play this game for hours at a time. I like to play heavily modded and lots of assets. You can create your own city to flourish with all kinds of styles, from industrial town to booming IT sensation."
26749,"Imagine SimCity grew up, got tattoos, developed a love of loud music and Jack Daniels and moved in next door and a blossoming friendship began."
26750,FUN
26751,its 2021... still playing love building new cities and keeps my mind fresh from being on lockdown.
26752,"Recommend this, definitely something that you should consider having"
26753,r6
26754,"Fun game, you can build your own city and be creative about it"
26755,I really love this game.
26756,good stuff
26757,build city lol
26758,"only play for mods and assets. This game has many unreasonable settings (dead wave, car line up in one line in highway, very few household in high residential buildings, ugly and limited choice of buildings...) which will frustrate you when you try to build your city. It is lucky to have great mods and assets to save its ass."
26759,"Hands down best city building game ever released. The possibilities are endless. Be sure to check out the workshop to get even more goodies to make your cities look amazing!

26764,"Great game.
Lot's of things to do.
Like build manage power water traffic and much more.
Some dlc's are required for some buildings.
Over all very fun."
26765,"Cities Skylines is a game I would highly recommend for its realistic mechanics and structured game. You can be as creative as you want with even just the base game and is definetely worth the price. But I wouldn't recommend this to people who dont understand games quickly or easily as it isnt a really easy game to understand but it should be easy enough.

26767,What Simcity should have been by now.
26768,"If you like to build your own city and be it's proud mayor, then this game is gosh darn for you!"

26774,Its beatiful to look at all the cities skylines in this game
26775,"good
"
26776,Had a great bustling city until I decided to experiment with a hydroelectric dam.... accidentally caused a tsunami which annihilated my entire city in about 60 seconds. Just a tip... don't remove a dam if you create one lol
26777,is good
26778,I have the game on Xbox and I love it so I thought I'd try it here... can't even get past the legal disclaimers so the game is UNPLAYABLE! Very annoying...
26779,Hella nice
26780,
26781,Good Game
26782,"TLDR: 8/10 city management game. 

Serviceable city builder with some limitations which may be fixable with mods, but you really shouldn't have to mod to solve fundamental annoyances.  For one, the lack of detailed, easily-accessible information is annoying once your cities grow large.  My revenues fluctuate wildly once my city gets big-- going from losing funds one minute to making $60k+ the next with no logical explanation.  The economics of the game need some work.  At one point, my commercial demand could not be satisfied for some reason.  It was just wonky.

There are some things that are just out of whack and it is very difficult to determine what is going on.  Would like to see very detailed data by district to include granular economic details.

Also, the garbage and dead people collection gets stupid.  Instead of having ""dumps"" as buildings, it should be an area similar to Sim City that can be covered, or have an option to export trash to another city.  You simply cannot keep up."
26783,"Great game, however unless you have at least 16 GB of RAM and a 6 core CPU the mods will bring your system to its knees."
26784,I like how you control the whole city
26785,Chill game to play when you're bored. I recommend that you get mods for it tho
26786,i like this game
26787,"I would definitely recommend this game to others.  I was a hardcore SIm City fan, and I had been looking for something that would take its place. Cities: Skylines provides superior gameplay. It can keep me hooked for hours upon hours.  It's an excellent game."
26788,Traffic Jam Simulator 2015. 10/10
26789,"For anyone who likes playing City Building games, this game is for you."
26790,"I've have this game a few years and it's always a game I can come back and the fun never fades. It's even more fun when you play with SimCity 4's soundtrack. 

This is what the EA SimCity Successor should have been!"
26791,
26792,Good game off the Sim City platform.
26793,"This game is life. very hard, but gives me life. so much in fact that I bought it three times, one on epic, one here, and one for Xbox. 10/10 Arguably the best game of all time. DLCs are too expensive tho :(. Didn't stop me from buying them. But save yourself the money and just buy mass transit, industries, and sunset harbor (the only good ones) and natural disasters if you like breaking things like I do."
26794,"great game you can get lost for hours in
"
26795,"The one thing I don't like about this game is the Garbage ! . I am having a hard time with controlling the garbage in the city. I have been watching video's on this and yet still cant seem to get it under control. But over all, i do like the game"
26796,"life changing game right here, after only 9.5 hours of gametime my eyes have truly been opened"
26797,"Insane variety and mods, but has some buggs. Would definitely recommend to satisfy creativity cravings."
26798,Great way to waste an entire Sunday.
26799,Great game for buildings cities. You can make it as simple or nitty gritty as you like. There even is an unlimited amount of money mode for starters like me. Enjoy!
26800,it good
26801,"Best city building game so far...
Mods can be necessary by time to be able to enjoy more complete experience.
Relax and enjoy your city grows!!!"
26802,"Downloading Traffic manager is a must. Apart from that, its the sim city of your dreams. Love the real citizens who go to work and go shopping."
26803,love it
26804,"Best city builder I ever played. Really enjoying it, so as the custom content that comes with it."
26805,yes good gmae
26806,It's quite relaxing. I recommend buying it and giving it a shot!
26807,"I have spend countles hours playing this game even before I bought it ;) this game is the best and most diverse city builder ever made, the amount of dlcs is crazy and with time I will complete the experience with all of them, since the DLCs add more and more content with each one"
26808,"As a geography teacher, this game speaks to me on so many levels! The way this game is developed, means I can use many elements in my own lessons! 

The fun of developing a city will never become boring to me. The creative freedom this game offers is exceptional. The problems you have to solve as your city grows are challenging, varied and realistic but mostly achievable (traffic can also be a nightmare and requires early planning when you start to urbanise and expand your city further).

I highly recommend this game for anyone whom has played SimCity, as well as those who like to see their plans and creations unfold."
26809,yes
26810,This is my favorite game in my library
26811,Good Game
26812,Awesome

26816,good game
26817,Fun and realistic graphics
26818,The End game gets glitchy an annoying but fun...
26819,it's pretty cool.
26820,Im addicted to this game. Played it on xbox for 2 years and loved it but wanted the community and mod support on PC. Glad I finally have a good computer to run it because there is so much to do in this game!
26821,"I really want to like this game, but it has serious accessibility issues. I can't play with a track pad or remap every control."
26822,fun
26823,"coming from sim city, this game scratches the itch very well."
26824,fun city builder with alot to explore.
26825,ez gud
26826,"Best city building game since Sim City (1989) & Transport Tycoon.

Classic."

26828,you make city
26829,Ive never been so invested in making a bus system run on time before now.
26830,good game
26831,"It's better than SimCity by miles. If you like management games and city builders, it really should be a nobrainer to get."
26832,"Ever felt like your city have some just AWFUL infrastructures? 
Maybe you think you can do a better job than professional city planners?

Well this is the game for you, build a city from ground up.
Struggle to keep the funds going while making the most pretty city in your imagination.
Fail to gather enough money so we bump up the taxes and keep building fossil fuel power.

It takes a bit to get into, but once you grasp the general rules, playing mayor is a pretty satisfying experience."
26833,fine
26834,"It's pretty fun. Not quite my cup of tea, but I'm sure plenty of people enjoy it."
26835,10 out of 10

26845,It's my favoite game
26846,fun to build and have fun with :)
26847,Great building sandbox Recomended if you like building cities and sandbox
26848,"i suck at it and need mods, but is fun!"
26849,"Absolutely the best sim of this type that ever existed. Graphics and overall gameplay are excellent with everything you need to running anything from a borough to a town, city, or megalopolis. It is extensible and has vast community support. I wouldn't be surprised if this is used by city planners or developers for real in conceptualizing their visions. If you like these types of semi-realistic simulators, put this at the top of your list and buy it! 

Now the problems and what this program is missing in my opinion:

While the visual interface is fine and you can assign keyboard short-cuts as would be expected, the default mouse controls fall short with regards to panning/scrolling the field of view. 'Edge Scrolling' as it's referred to in the game is performed by moving the mouse pointer to the edges of the screen (stupid to me) or by using the keys WASD (better) to move right/left and forward/back. I don't get why the interface shouldn't follow normal and expected behavior in 3D space. The middle-mouse button is for zoom and if it has a button, rotation. The right-mouse button is used only to 'cancel an operation' such as when building a road or placing objects. This makes just moving around somewhat awkward. You can't use the mouse to pan and the zoom is not context-aware. None of this can be changed in settings from what I could see and for now, this is the biggest annoyance to me.

Overall a fantastic game that is fun to play and has tremendous potential!"
26850,Propaganda
26851,"+200 hours played and I still enjoy it. In my opinion is the best city builder, is too complete and has a lot of things that I haven't seen in other city builders. Another good part of this game is it's community, that has made a lot of mods to improve or fix the things that the game lacks."
26852,its just amazing. i love it. just wish i didnt work so many hours. i can only play it few times a week. roll on retirement i will be on it 24 hours lol
26853,Game takes more than 10 mins to open and then crashes.
26854,goofd
26855,It is a perfect game if you like to build cities!
26856,fun but difficult to learn
26857,"You really need mods to make this game what it should be, but it is the best city builder out there. I can still sink a couple hours into this game every once in a while, and I find I do come back to it every few months - just to see if I can try and get the last few achievements."
26858,cool
26859,This game rocks.
26860,"I started off confused af ,but then i watched a random video from biffa on how to start a city and bam! now im worried about whether jim gets to work on a train or a car or if the highway is to loud for him."

26862,This is by far the best Simcity base game i have ever played. Everytime back in the day when I played Simcity I was like i wish Icould do this. well now I can
26863,is fun 100%
26864,The best city building game you can play!!!
26865,i want 1000 hours

26867,A great city builder game!
26868,Good for passing time and also good if you're dead serious in cashing out a lot of your time. I play this game from time to time
26869,10/10 would let my citizens die of overflowing sewage again
26870,"Incredibly abusive game  developer. Employees are masquarading as regular players in the community, to sabotage workshop items created by actual players, in order to generate more DLC sales. I have not ever encountered a more dishonest company.

The game itself is fun and frustrating in equal measures. It is extremely buggy, and developers rely on the modding community to fix bugs and implement missing functionality.

The game includes a keylogger, exfiltrating to Paradox Online Publishing Services. When I discovered and reported it I got prompty abused by an army of 800 trolls, coordinated by the Community Manager herself.

I would not play this game even for free. Avoid at all cost."
26871,"very much fun
"
26872,great sim city game
26873,cool game
26874,Very nice.
26875,"good game, for me personally sometimes i dont understand why some things go bad when i build town areas but still fun"

Pros:
 + Lots of mods
Cons:
 - Not enough strip clubs"
26877,"sewage volcano, SEWAGE VOLCANO, SEWAGE VOLCANO!"
26878,Its been great for killing time during all the quarantines throughout Covid-19. The vanilla game in itself is alright but the true fun comes when you start adding things from the workshop.
26879,Don't buy this game if you aren't prepared to waste £50 on dlc's on this game
26880,game good
26881,It is very fun:)
26882,It's fun and relaxing. Can be a challenge at times at least for me since I am still fairly new to this game but it doesn't take away from a beautiful experience this game gives.

26892,Es muy entretenido
26893,Great Price for an amazing game. Way better than simcity even with a smaller budget and team.
26894,Great game for testing your city management skills.
26895,its a really fun game but i think it needs a more in depth tutorial... other that that i fully recommend
26896,The ultimate city builder. It almost makes the failure of SimCity (2013) worth it.
26897,"Great game, it's pretty hard to start a city but pretty easy to go bankrupt. I'm addicted to it."
26898,"Until if ever SimCity will be a thing again, or if Cities Skylines 2 will appear, wink wink Paradox, this is really the only option. Even the vanilla experience is quite good."

26929,"Excellent gaming experience, fun to plan the cities in the way I hanker."
26930,"I initially got the game because I was a longtime fan of the SimCity franchise. After SimCity was bought (and destroyed by) EA I began looking for a new city building game to fill that void. I will readily admit that Cities Skylines is not a 1 to 1 replacement for SimCity and does not have the same feel as past SimCity games. However, I would definitely recommend Cities Skylines to anyone looking for a well made fun to play city builder game that scratches the itch left behind by the lack of new SimCity games."
26931,the best citybuilder
26932,Can't wait for oxygen DLC.
26933,Good Game
26934,Vanilla? its barren but still better than SimCity 2013. Modded? Best city builder ever released.

26938,engaging & great value
26939,"I feel like this game is very good, with or without mods, its fun. However, i do recommend to play with mods since the game feels pretty bland without the mods. Also buy one of the dlcs, If you can."
26940,Not the most reliable game or mods in the world but it's certainly addictive.
26941,"Remember SimCity? Yeah, imagine SimCity, but more sophisticated and free from the shackles of EA. Very mod friendly, no horrendous online-only component, and deeper gameplay. A definite must-have for anyone interested in city builders, no questions asked."
26942,This is such a great game that keep you busy for countless hours. Every designers dream come true!!! Planning is so important in this game. Worth every penny
26943,"Game is very addicting I never realized how much I'd enjoy playing this you just get to building and then one thing leads to another its a nice change of pace from playing shooters, rpgs, sports games. I just sit back turn on some tunes and build away in sandbox mode."
26944,"Best city simulation game...if you are good, you can actually create the city you live in right now"
26945,This game is super fun! I've spent hours playing it on other platforms (Xbox); I was unable to really progress my city because it got to big and crashed my old pc (Ryzen 3 2300x and a RX 560); now my new pc is fine (Ryzen 9 3900x and RTX 2080); If you want to play this I would recommend having at least a 6 core processor! Alright bye!
26946,Addictive.

26995,Great game
26996,Enjoyable
26997,"Okay so... here's the thing. This game is extremely detailed, it prides in communist- uhh good economic powerhouses of cities, and the game really lets you feel in a position of power. Of which for some is probably not a good idea.

Great game play it. And make sure you put the yellow zones next to the green ones it really helps! Trust me..."
26998,just fantastic
26999,Very in depth.
27000,"This game is great city building game i ever play.

27004,10/10 will name a road Steve again!
27005,"Perfect for city builders alike. If you like games in which you take care of place or person, then this is the game for you. The unlimited money option is amazing; it lets me customize towns and make them look however I want (of course with some mods which are easy to install)! I've already made the Imperial City from Elder Scrolls: Oblivion. 11/10."
27006,"The greatest city building game, period."
27007,"Cities skylines is an amazingly fun game, and i have spent many hours on it. However the game would not be same if not for certain DLC and mods. They are definitely required to make the game a more fun and immersive experience."
27008,So far so good.
27009,Better than old SimCities :)
27010,I enjoy the realism and granular features that make it happen.
27011,great game. very fun to play and has given me hours of enjoyment
27012,funny game hahahahahahahha
27013,"Started building a city. Took 25 hours to realise I'm bad at this game, but I enjoyed it. Currently the best city builder"
27014,i build city. is good
27015,Spent over 400 hours on this game. Super addicting. I try to play any chance I get.
27016,I very enjoy
27017,It's a really fun game and it helped me pass my geo class.
27018,"I have always been a SimCity fan, but this game destroy is. It has everything the last SimCity should have had and more. If you like city builders, this one is the best by far."
27019,7/10
27020,What a great game
27021,"Honestly Just an all around good game that is easy to understand. If you like games like factorio, surviving mars, and  sim city you'll like city skylines."
27022,"pretty fun, but definitly hard to start up your city"
27023,uh yup
27024,"after the mods this game is dream come true ,"
27025,i like to make roads

27029,Game with regular update and robust mod community.
27030,One of the best City Builder so far to date.
27031,pogga
27032,this game has so much going for it but i'm sorry why the hell is it so slow it took me two hours to load up a save and it never even loaded it just struggles to load even with a fairly beefy computer
27033,Awesome game :)
27034,There is so much you can do in this game. From building a thriving economy to making a terrible city that destroys itself over time. 100% worth it
27035,good game
27036,"Very nice game. I recommend it! Install it, Play it, Love it!!!"
27037,"it's just a vibe, a good/chill vibe you know"
27038,Terrific game for those who like to play sandboxes.
27039,"nice for architecture and urban planning students, still traffic is bad. very entertaining, would be better if there is more optimization for a bigger city."
27040,"citys, is an amazing game, you draw roads you pand next to roads, whats not to love, some roads have tracks on it with wires over it, the workshop takes anything and makes it better, when you get your city big enough for the big tall buildings well, just amazing, getting to chose from multiple transport options to transport asmany people as possible, the game is fun"
27041,epic
27042,this is a good game
27043,"I spent 2 hours just trying to get a useless launcher to install. Whats even the point of it? Steam manages updates and things that like. I don't want to see ads when I start my game. Get this game off steamunlocked, don't spend money on it."
27044,The absolute best city builder out there.
27045,"Its good for people who wants to be a City Designer!, i really recommend this game!"
27046,yes
27047,yes
27048,"very fun city bulding game but 1 issue very long loading time for save game / new game / editor  

since the snow* dlc came out i has this issue it used to take 7 min to load a game or new but after the pardox luncher it now takes 12 min they say to remove all mods and reinstall the game wich i have tryed but stull have same issue if you buy this game make shure you have a 3.5 gz cpu , 18 gb ram 1650 geforce gfx card"
27049,One of the best city builders of all time.
27050,"What can you say about Cities Skylines... It is probably the greatest city builder game today and probably well into the future. I do not know really how they could make this game better. They have made the game extremely mod friendly and many take advantage of that including myself. The developers might surprise us and come out with something better like a cities skylines 2, but...lol I feel like the only thing they can do is destroy the game like SimCity did with their new additions. Therefore my suggestion for the developers would be if you want to upgrade this game in any way. Just use mods. I own all but the music ones which do not interest me. That way they wont destroy the game and just continue to make it better if that is possible...lol....This is the best city building game on the market...Period. Please do not destroy that by coming out with a version 2 of this game... Just create mods.  With all that said... I cannot recommend this game enough if you like to build cities. There is a very large support community as well as many modders that support this game. But beware! Once you start building a city. You will be doomed and will become part of this community and you will live in your city. Life as you knew it will be over and your Sim life will begin."
27051,its calming. relaxing.
27052,dlc nya mahal weh

27062,"At first this game was confusing was complicated and tough but as you gradually get used to it, its really fun and the DLC's are awesome. 10/10"

27069,"Like any game you have to really get into it to truly appreciate it. 

Explore the mods made by many talented players and download some highly rated maps and assets to see what can be done.

And play it on PC."
27070,Descent game.
27071,Its a good game and it has mods so that makes it a better game.
27072,i finally figured out how to make cities without mods
27073,Hire a traffic engineer.
27074,Its just a great game to play. i can do stupid stuff or play seriously and have fun either way.
27075,relaxing
27076,
27077,Game no longer open. It would say that game crashed
27078,very fun
27079,Great game for wasting time and just unwinding.
27080,Play it.
27081,"It is a cool game for city building game enthusiasts but (opinion) I feel like the base game is not very fun. Sure when you start out learning everything maybe be daunting and fun but after you get to megalopolis, the game does not offer much. So, without the dlc's or steam workshop, this game is not an enjoyable game long term."
27082,This has to be the most unlikely addiction I have ever had
27083,Always a game i can come back too. The community is one of the best. Workshop has  everything you need for a custom game. Paradox also has never let me down really with any title. If your heavy into city building or just want to play around making maps or cities this is the only game that will give you want you want.
27084,its real good
27085,"Having done tutorial hints, read tooltips, even watched some videos, I can truly say, I don't get it. Seems good, thou. But Paradox sickness makes me downvote it, because right now, the complete game is over 200€, and that, it isn't worth."
27086,"I love building and simulation games.  as a big fan of Sim City, Cites Skylines is a great advance in the simulation area."
27087,
27088,Love this game a ton

27091,"Cool game. nice pace, easy to learn but still a nice depth"
27092,Best city-builder game since SimCity 4. In Cities skilines you can build absolute identical copy of you real city (if you're using lots of mods). 10\10
27093,nice to play
27094,cool game
27095,Great simulation game where I can build my own city. The possibilities are endless!
27096,"It is a great game, much better than Sim City. Get Snowfall DLC if you are Canadian! Winter maps, Hockey rinks, snowmobile trails!"
27097,"amazing game just wow, worth the price."
27098,its verr gud but when i tried loading up a save the game always crashes at 99%
27099,"The Game Is Amazing!
If you put Infinite Money The Game Its Easy and you can try every thing, Its Good and you will love playing it!"
27100,"Keeps you busy for hours, highly recommend to use the steam workshop as well!"
27101,"This feels like a corporate executive game, the kind you have on while you are working and play for ten minutes at a time. You'll then find you have spent four hours straight on it and be screaming at your imaginary citizens because they seem to not understand that vacated buildings can have new tenants and find yourself oddly absorbed.

Also, be mindful it may seem like a good idea to hike up tax to pay for things in the short term but people can be very quick to leave and return to your city based on tax numbers. it is good decision to keep you patient but funny when it backfires."
27102,The game is only playable with DLC and mods
27103,can't stop playing!!
27104,GREAT

27110,Just love it! Great graphics and hours of play.
27111,"I tried playing the vanilla game for a bit but got frustrated by the silly game logic. I tried installing a rather large number of mods to alleviate the detractions, but never really succeeded. Unfortunately, I'm probably never going to play this again. A huge disappointment, really..."

27119,"Greatest citybuilder since the original Sim City, without question."
27120,Eats more ram than Google Chrome
27121,"Having played cities skylines on-and-off throughout the years it is by far the best city builder out there. Even the base game, without any of the DLC (which in my opinion in most cases is not needed) is a blast to play. The traffic AI is a bit wonky (albeit stupid) at times, and if you don't have a monster PC expect some lag the bigger your city gets. Overall, if your into sim games, especially building sims, Cities Skylines is the way to go."
27122,"Amazing Game !
"
27123,good
27124,"A game that teaches you absolutely nothing about it and then punishes you severely for being bad at the game. Oh, and you also need a ton of mods for this game to be worth a damn."
27125,"This is a very great game if you want a calm and nice way to create your own city , going through details such as water , electricity , trash , pollution , etc. The game community is also very active , creating very complex and interesting maps , props and buildings that can be easily installed through the workshop from Steam. The graphics are also very nice for a game that for my standards is pretty old. Had the game before but I had to refund it since my PC was too slow to make it work , bought it again in 2020 ( had it in 2018 for the first time ) and now with my new PC pieces it works very great! I deffinetly recommend it. :)))"
27126,The best simulation game ever!
27127,this game is awesome. and having steam work shop mods makes it million times better
27128,great
27129,all good
27130,"If you ever enjoyed Sim City, you'll love this. Worth grabbing all of the expansions on sale, but like with any Paradox game they're not quite worth the full price of admission with so many available."
27131,make city be happy
27132,w
27133,This game is the best City Building game out there!
27134,it's a great game
27135,i wish i can buy all the DLC's
27136,"Same good from sim city 4, less bad from sim city 4"
27137,"TL;DR: The game is great, just some of the road mechanics can be really annoying.

I love this game. It's relaxing to play and rewarding to build a city. My biggest complaint about the game though is the road mechanics.
The highways suck. What do I mean by this? Well in real life when an on-ramp joins a highway, a lane gets added for a bit to allow the cars to merge and it's nice and even. In this game, increasing a highway section's lane count makes the section widen on both sides instead of just where you want to add a lane.
Here's how it is in this game: https://i.imgur.com/CuBO0CA.png
Here's how it is in real life (and how it should be): https://i.imgur.com/TsXNNkY.png
The whole highway merging system in this game sucks. You need a traffic manager mod, which only gets you most of the way to good merging anyway. Oh and not to mention you need DLC or assets to even get highways other than 3-lane ones. You can't even get 2-lane highways without DLC or assets. The zoning can also be a pain sometimes. And good luck if you want to have things nice and even.
Just in general, connecting 2 roads into a single road really sucks."
27138,$hit lake
27139,Beautifully designed and easy to play.
27140,"Addictive and highly recommended with mods to keep everything fresh. Most DLCs are good (Mass Transit, Industries, Parklife, Green Cities are my most recommended ones.) I got the game on sale so if your unsure maybe wait until it reduces in price a bit. I'm not sure if it's just my PC (though it exceeds the recommended specs) but sometimes when loading up a new save it gets stuck in the loading screen and I have to close the game with Task Manager which is a bit annoying. Otherwise no major bugs or glitches and in-game it always runs smoothly."
27141,gud
27142,"This game is great! , it has so much freedom and you can do so much , there are free mods and so much more i recommend this game to anyone that has creativity.!"

27146,One of the best City building sim games ever made. Bought it when its on sale. Recommended!
27147,"This is the game SimCity 4 players have been waiting for. It's not without its flaws, but if you enjoyed any of the old Maxis games, you'll enjoy this one."
27148,"If you liked sim City, you will love this game. The mods are so easy to use and add to the game, don't be scared to try them. PC classic in my eyes."
27149,this game removes the realization that i have no power in this world.
27150,"Not the same dynamics as the good old SimCity, but entertaining!"
27151,This is THE best city builder game there is. Love it!

Pros summary:
1. freedom of making my city
2. full of mods
3. good DLCs
4. harmony of all of above
5. city styles can be easily changed

Cons summary:
1. high RAM and CPU usage
2. DLC price unless during sale
3. Paradox Launcher"
27157,"City Skylines is the best City-building game out there. It employs realistic simulation of city growth, RCI zoning, Campus management, Park Management, Road Construction, Traffic Simulation and Disaster Mitigation and Management. 

Playing the Vanilla version is great but if you want to try and build realistic cities, workshop mods will help you to attain realism. 

On the other hand, the amount of money you need to spend on DLCs is tremendous. I highly recommend to grab only these DLCs on winter and summer sale. 

My top five DLCs are:

1. Industries
2. After Dark
3. Mass Transit 
4. Parklife
5. Campus"

27170,It's like skyrim if skyrim was a city building simulator set in the 21st century
27171,Good game.
27172,The best city builder there is.
27173,"Best city simulator there is. DLCs expand the game a lot, but the base game is still very engaging and addicting."
27174,Good game but need a pc with power to run it (sadly :( )
27175,I love creating a large city with lots of pollution and then flood it and kill everyone there.
27176,Ngl this game got too addicting. Only recommend if you have too much time on your hands
27177,"FAR superior to the micromanagement EA has done to Maxis and the SimCity franchise. SimCity USED to be good as many of you know, but EA just loves to ruin anything they touch. Back to Cities Skylines though, this game is rampant with the amount of creativity you can do here. Your imagination and proper understanding of the game mechanics are the only limits. I absolutely love this game and I doubt this game will be removed from the throne of best city simulation game for quite some time. The team who made this game clearly poured their hearts and souls into making this game. VERY well done!"
27178,fun game
27179,WOW

27181,its fun

27183,"Cities: Skylines, released in March of 2015 is one of the first games ever to enter my Steam library. While I haven't put nearly enough hours into this game, it's definitely one I've wanted to get back into. Despite having been released nearly 6 years ago as of writing this, the game has continued to receive content updates and as well as maintaining an active modding community.

Cities: Skylines describes itself as a ""modern take on the classic city simulation."" Architect your own city from the ground up and see how it stands against environmental and economic hardships. Expand your city into a metropolis, but be sure to take into consideration population satisfaction and the environmental impact your city might have.

While players have used Cities: Skylines to recreate real-world cities, there have been a few stories where Cities: Skylines was effectively used in real-world application in order to simulate how traffic might behave. A Wired article published in 2019 by Will Bedingfield, which focused on one player's solution to the Golden Gate Bridge's traffic in San Francisco, described the appeal to Cities: Skylines as a way to address real-world problems we face in urban planning. The article stated, ""Cities: Skylines lets players act on this frustration, and fix their urban environment."" later going on to comment, ""...even if the solutions to urban problems Cities: Skylines offers are sometimes questionable, the game instils in players at least two important principles. It teaches players to see their surroundings as changeable, and it encourages them to claim their right to influence that change.""

Personally I've always had a fascination with urban planning, from how one city thrived while one just a little further up river didn't to hostile architecture in urban environments. Cities: Skylines is the perfect playground for city builders to realize their utopia."
27184,good with mods
27185,why do my people keep dying
27186,fun game kills time
27187,Awesome Game
27188,"I was a big fan of Simcity3000 a long ago.
And i finally dared to buy this game.
at the first glance everything is fine.
But after playing some time...

CONS:
1) but after several hours i started notice little but very annoying details. 25 stairs building with 25 households? are you kidding me?

2) 5 hospitals for city with less than 30k of citizens? Are you crazy? have you ever tried to imagine how much doctors should be to cover 2.5k of sick ppl?

3) Okay, but what about misbalance between elementary school and others? Why elementary school can sustain so less pupils?

4) water. Water operations is like a fairy tail.

5) everything interesting in game comes with addons which cost as a game itself.

PROS:
1) Mind Games with car and autobus traffic. There is no simple answer and it's a real ""theory of games"" how different ppl decided at once to use only your new road to reach their job instead of using a bit longer way but without any traffic jams. So cute, so real.
==================
Overall:
If you are waiting a real adult strategy game - it is not worth your money."

27190,nice details
27191,Rip 'n Tear Till Its Done!
27192,"A fun, relaxing city builder. A great game to pass time."
27193,It's like Sim City but you can put in WAY more detail and I LOVVVVVVE it.

27195,haha town go brrrrrrrrr
27196,"Its got a few niggles but the modding community have got their shit together. Good, time consuming game. 

"
27197,It is a very in depth city builder with lots and lots of immersion. Its easy to lose track of time playing this game.
27198,kill the all do it
27199,"This is a very good / addicting video game. Playing built-in scenarios and setting goals that you come up with on your own keep the game feeling fresh. 

30% traffic flow/ 10 - would recommend"
27200,I think this game is incredible. you have to buy it. I recommend it to everyone
27201,NOT A BAD GAME TO LOSE YOURSELF IN
27202,"Do you like Sim City? Then you would absolutely love this Game!
This Game was made with the labor of love!

27207,Just a fun time consuming game! Love it!
27208,"This game is great. Fantastic ultra realistic city building sim, will take hours and hours of your time and so much replay value

A couple of major problems (for me) with it though are 1) the active agent limit; basically once you hit a population of 200,000 or so, the city begins to break down as it can no longer function as the maximum number of 'active' citizens in the map is 65k (I think). This means that if there are 65k agents active, then the next one that needs to become active at that point is queued and has to wait until an active agent completes its task. This means that police, fire department, medical, logistics, etc. all begin to grind to a halt as the backlog and queue keeps growing. Took the fun from it for me as I like playing on huge modded maps

2) Finances are very shallow. As in taxation and public spending"
27209,Cities: Skylines
27210,It's one the best games I play in my free time! You HAVE to get it!!!

27222,One of the best city building game i've ever played but i dont really like the dlc stuff they had its confusing and too much costly too
27223,"It is an interesting game, however as your city grows it becomes more and more like a real job, where you have to plan and design the growth of your city.

But still, this is a nice experience even if your are not into sandbox games."
27224,Great game modding is fun it’s a border curing game I highly recommend this game

27228,Its a excellently made city builder. What else can I say?
27229,very fun
27230,best city builder out there...but too many deaths
27231,having the ability to mod the game.
27232,"City: Skylines is an addictive city builder/ traffic simulator originally released on Windows/ MacOS and Steam on March 10th, 2015 developed by Colossal Order and Published by Paradox Interactive. This Game makes SimCity and other city builders look like a cheap arcade game The only negative of the game is that there is way to much paid downloadable Content (DLC) but that is the normal for Paradox Interactive Published titles."
27233,I like red big buses and this game has a big red bus *happy emoji*
27234,"No way to opt-out of the ""telemetry"", disagree with privacy policy after some recent updates. It will quit, so unplayable."
27235,"This a really amazing and addictive game. it is so fun. it is preferred to have some DLCs as it will add a lot to the gameplay. but even without DLCs the game will be so fun to play for long periods of time. this game is very mod-able as well, you will find thousands of mods, assets, and maps on the steam workshop. the game's graphics are pretty good and the soundtrack is good too. performance wise its not so good and badly optimized but on the correct settings and resolution it still can be playable at low end PCs. i heavily recommend this game, you wont regret and it is totally worth it."
27236,amazing. better than simcity
27237,Highly customisable to suit whatever city-building gameplay strategies you prefer.  DLCs are exceptional and worth the price of admission.
27238,finnaly a game where i can make utopia
27239,fun
27240,Very good!
27241,"Gets boring, soon. No missions. Crashes very often"
27242,gud
27243,"the agent simulation is cool but it limits the scope of the cities you can build. the management aspect of the game is nowhere near as good as simcity 4 either. the mods are what make this game worth buying, really."
27244,city man the man of the cities
27245,"good city management game
better with mods
good updates and very nice DLCs"
27246,"[h1]⭐Review for Cities: Skylines[/h1]
[b]This game has fascinated me since its early days back in 2015. In a challenging way, it offers countless ways to build and manage your cities and is tremendously fun!
What makes this game so unique? The community, whose expansions keep the game alive in a sensational way![/b]


[u][b]🕹️The main game:[/b][/u]

🧭You quickly get into the game and learn many useful things to create a nice looking scene in a short time. The difficult thing is to keep the city going. [quote=💬Paradox Interactive]Constructing your city from the ground up is easy to learn, but hard to master.  [/quote]

⚖️Finding the right balance between important areas like education, public safety, health care, firefighting, water supply, electricity, economy and much more is definitely not easy. And the more the city grows, the more difficult it becomes to master these things.

🚦In addition, there is the complex traffic simulation, which also needs to be closely monitored.
For example, you can spend several hours designing and building a working highway exit. After a while, after you have expanded your city, built a new district, recruited more inhabitants, got the economy going, the exit you built does not work as it should, usually it just makes things worse and a newer, better solution is needed.

💡This concept from the example above also applies to the other areas of the game.
What sounds frustrating at first is a real blessing for the game. It is motivating, challenges you and your thinking, and makes it hard to stop playing.

💭I hope you understand what I am trying to say: You have so many possibilities and when you think you have finally done something right, it is disproved in the next moment and that's what makes the game so exciting and challenging.


[u][b]🧩Expansions:[/b][/u]

🔋Many games also develop so-called DLCs, which are usually intended to expand the players' experience. This is what the developers of ""CS"" do very well and have also really convinced the one or other time. Some of the expansions really stand out, others can be bought for a small pleasure, but are not really must-haves.

🔎Here is just a brief overview and recommendation (more detailed information would require a separate review):

    [tr]
        [td]🚧Mass Transit[/td]
        [td]🟢[/td]
        [td]The first popular expansion for the game! This DLC will definitely help you and make it easier for you to better manage traffic situations in your city. There are also some really cool means of transport![/td]

    [tr]
        [td]♻️Green Cities[/td]

        [td]🏭Industries[/td]
        [td]🟢[/td]

    [tr]
        [td]📚Campus[/td]
        [td]🟢[/td]
        [td]Similarly great DLC as ""Industries"", but for the educational aspect. Beautiful assets and outstandingly good functions that bring a new challenge into the game again. Here you can see clearly that the developers have found the right path towards the community![/td]

    [tr]
        [td]🎣Sunset Harbor[/td]
        [td]🟢[/td]
        [td]The current DLC has surpassed itself. Not only because the free update brings many good options, but also the diversity. A new industrial sector: fishing, other means of transport and much more. Nice to have![/td]
    [/tr]
    [tr]
        [td]➕Other[/td]
        [td]🔴[/td]
        [td]There are further small DLC packages (some for free!), radio channels and so-called Content Creator Packs.[/td]
    [/tr]
[/table]

💰Sounds too good to be true? Well, the DLCs and other little expansions have their price...
If you add it all up, you'll easily get over 200 Euros. [i]Whether this economic strategy is good and ethically correct is not for me to decide, I know too little about it.[/i]
But the good side: The purchases are of course optional and the important in-game changes come for free with the updates!

[u][b]💪The Game Changer (Mods & More)[/b][/u]

👀As you have seen, this game already has a lot to offer. But the incredible thing is that there is even more: the steam workshop and its community!

⚙️Anyone who is familiar with programming can create mods for Cities Skylines and share them with anyone who owns the game. And WOW, some people would have done better as developers at Colossal Order. These players, who programmed mods in their spare time, have created real game changers. Actually, I don't even want to play the game without such mods anymore, because they bring awesome additional features.

🛠Besides mods, there are also assets that can also be created and provided by anyone. And WOW 2.0, there are some really unbelievable nice looking buildings, props, vehicles, streets, save games, maps, color corrections and much much more...

📜In summary, this is the recipe of Cities' success and why the game is still very popular after almost 6 years. Constant development, new things, new features, for all areas and ideas. And if something is missing, create it yourself!
[hr][/hr]
[u][b]9/10✔️[/b][/u]
[b]Colossal Order has definitely created a masterpiece for us, which thanks to its community has been played by many happy gamers since 2015 and will surely remain so for a few years to come.

27247,"It is so much better with mods and custom maps. I feel like you need all the dlc's in order to have a good experience with the game. The vanilla maps are okay, they just feel so unenthusiastic to play."
27248,Nothing
27249,Crooked roadwork keeps messing with my ocd...
27250,Yum
27251,I suddenly want to quit my job and become a civil engineer. Send help!
27252,"I love city and regional planning. I love architecture, this game is AMAZING!"
27253,nice to play but its time consuming to make good cities:)
27254,Its really fun :thumbs_up:
27255,"A better successor of SimCity but with way more fun and well... city management BUT! That doesn't mean this game is bad! It's actually a LOT better than you might think! It has a great community, great developers, great DLCs! Yet... the performance is bad like REALLY BAD to run this game you need at least a high end gaming PC or a NASA Pleiades Supercomputer. Even my already quite decent PC barely runs this game due to game engine optimisations and even those workshop add-ons that optimise this game even those CAN'T help!"
27256,LL
27257,Very cool game where you can let your creative thoughts about building a city shine. Awsome
27258,Amazingly detailed city builder with a Wealth of depth .
27259,so complex
27260,"it is really huge game ... I used to install many many modes in order to make my own project.
but to be honest it need lots of memory..
I have 16GB but they are not enough so far"
27261,"very fun game btw, after few days of playing, love this game so much."
27262,Its so great. With mods even better.
27263,What SimCity should have been
27264,"I enjoy cities skylines very much. I have not played many games similiar to it (only simcity 3000 and few tycoon games) and it took some time for me to get the hang of it , for which the game helps by unlocking functionalities one by one. Once you learn the basics though it gets quite fun, can't wait fot cities skylines 2."
27265,"takes a long time to get with it, but it'll work in the end. eventually. probably a long time."
27266,very cool
27267,great games
27268,"Nice game to you, before going to be a Governor."
27269,Good game
27270,It's as if Sim City just kept making their game :D.  Love this game so much
27271,I absolutely love it
27272,I LOVE this game!
27273,"City building game. Like an upgraded version of simcity.
To get full potential must use mods.
5 Star

27274,Spent my life on it :)
27275,After playing this game you will find yourself looking at infrastructure on Google Earth for fun.
27276,"Great game, easy to use once you figure it out. the Depth is insane, but not overwhelming."
27277,"I can play this for hours, non-stop. Even when I get bored building, I can follow my citizens like a stalker until I need to get back to work. lol"
27278,"Love the game, though needs vastly improved traffic AI."
27279,"i named a district ""ASS"" lmao"
27280,"Aside from the heavy need for mods and custom content due to lack of very important features (such as RIGHT HAND TURNING), this game is incredibly fun"
27281,Fun game
27282,700+ hours in and it hasn't gotten old yet! This is the game Simcity should have sought to be
27283,"This game is super fun, but traffic is really hard without mods."
27284,"Really great game it's incredibly fun to sit back and relax while (trying) to build a beautiful city. One of the best things about this game is all of the additional content that's available. Tons of DLC if you want to purchase them some of which add a lot of good features as well as new buildings, roads, transport systems, etc. I would recommend waiting for them to go on sale and do some research on which ones to purchase as some are much better than others, but they can add a lot to the experience. Also if your into it there are a ton of amazing mods and community made content available to download from the workshop."
27285,"IT'S A CHALLENGE, EVEN FOR ME......LOL"
27286,It's pretty fun
27287,You can be so creative.
27288,"The game is fun, challenging and has a lot of great mods out there. If you're someone who likes relaxing with building a beautiful city, someone who likes challenging their selves with traffic management, or just like destroying cities after building them (Disasters DLC) then this is the game for you! With 295 (at the time of writing this and not including the play time I have on my Xbox One), I highly recommend this to city building fanatics!"
27289,Its a nice change of pace for me. This game allows you to open your  mind and allow the creative and  strategy to flow as you play. Love this game so far.
27290,It's really nice game. The only thing that might be not that good is the fact that you have to deal with many problems at a time and it might be a little bit frustrating. But that is what keeps you interested in the game and really makes you think how you can solve a problem simple or complex.
27291,"Truly a fun and highly addictive game to get attached to, I've played for over 500 hours of this game and I'm still not bored. Would recommend this game to anyone."
27292,"great sim. it great for those rainy days on the weekend
"
27293,"I like building cities, but i uh suck at keeping them running efficiently. oh well, time to make another one and try again."
27294,Immense
27295,Great game that really helps everyone
27296,"love it, relaxing to build a city
"
27297,its a sandbox for city building :D
27298,can be addictingg bruhhhhh download mods and assets from the workshop for a better experience
27299,the game is fun but I just don't like this game well i like it on my Xbox but not on PC. I still love the game and its great. the game does crash but it is still a fun game. I would recommend this game.
27300,.
27301,If you're a fan of Sim City and want to take it to the extreme next level than this is the game for you.
27302,Haha 69
27303,Needs mods and expansions to be totally worth it and playable. After you get into things and have enough mods its pretty engaging and you can lose yourself for hours on end. Little bit addictive.
27304,Holy shit I've played this for 8 hours? That's a time sink baybeeee and I'm happy to live it.
27305,"Build your own city bro!
Streets, houses, shops, factories, shopping malls, offices, highways, police stations, fire stations, hospitals, airports, trees, parks, skyscrapers, stadiums, space elevators, power plants, bridges, dams, graveyards, crematories, libraries, universities, power lines, wastewater treatment plants, drain pipes, ports, subways, bus stations and many more....

Entertaining game 6/7
"
27306,
27307,I have been playing this game for over a year on PS4 and loved it. It is a very addicting game and I have even lost sleep over how much time i spend on it. 5 more minutes truly means 1 more hour. The game is a lot of fun to play vanilla but if you get mods and hacks it is a lot more fun as you can build things faster.
27308,Very nice
27309,Nice
27310,waste of time
27311,MUCH FUN

27316,Fun Game
27317,"This game lets me live out my fantasy job of being a city planner and building the cities of my dreams (without the guaranteed chaos that doing these things IRL would cause)! 10/10 highly recommend if you like Sims, SimCity, or really any other simulation/design type games"
27318,good

27323,"make a pit, put an island in the center of it, put sewage in the rim, and put a school on the island

kill citizens, 10/10"
27324,This game is everything I have ever wanted in a city builder. It allowed me to explore a passion of mine. I have invested in all of the expansion packs and even bought it for the nintendo switch as well. I have put a couple thousand hours into it and don't regret it at all. Mods and assets are amazing even on my slow computer that often struggles to run the game. It breaks my heart that my laptop was recently damaged and the game currently does not run so I am limited to the switch version. I cannot explain how much this game means to me and the importance of it in my life. I would recommend more than any other game I have played.
27325,best city management game since sim city 3000
27326,fun game
27327,Amazing game! So easy to get lost in it.
27328,i like this game
27329,Great little time killer when 4:20pm hits.
27330,TERRIBLE!!! Worked on a beast town for couple of hours then game crashed and now all progress is gone and I have to start all over again
27331,fun productive and very water resistant :)
27332,"[h1] ""Addictive Waste of Time"" will make you wonder what the hell are you doing with your lif... oh wait, I can build another metro system, be right with you... [/h1]

Pricey as heroin and just as addictive, this game will ruin your life. But in my view it's a warm calm slow corner to return to if I don't want to focus and create something meaningless while listening to my best music playlists.
If you like builders games there is no question about buying this game. And the mods for this game... amazing. A shout out to all modders out there.

Now I am going back to my only low residential-farming-fishing-village. Yeah... that's why this recommendation smells..."
27333,I managed to loose two million dollars in 5 minutes
27334,Passes.

27336,good one

27339,A really satisfying and calming game.
27340,Very addicting and soothing gameplay.
27341,"I lost my save file, damn"
27342,"The best city builder in the market for many years hands down. 
The only minus in book is the DLC content. 
The workshop community takes up the slack."
27343,Best SimCity out there.  Relaxing gameplay and nice visuals.
27344,"In short, Cities Skylines is one of the top 3 city building games until today. I will update the post if it turns otherwise."
27345,Addictive . Need to play online for the mods. :(
27346,excellent game! I have played this game for four years.
27347,it good
27348,"TONIGHT ON BOTTOM GEAR:

I try to stay awake,

Hammond try's to build a city,

And James sewage overflows"
27349,Most things about this game are really thought out and are fun! The little Hamlets to the big cities. It feels really good to build a village and actually make a profit! And also the mods people make are very creative as well. also! The Natural Disasters add some fun if you get burnt out! 9/10!
27350,It's a very fun game if you love building and (Big) cities / variation.
27351,Fun
27352,Afaik still the best city sim (which is kind of sad given how long it's been out)
27353,city game go brr
27354,"it is fun game
"
27355,Such a good game.
27356,This game is masterpiece. Best city builder ever made. It's the only game that I can play for hrs and not get any negative feelings. Everytime I play it it's like meditation lol
27357,"good
"
27358,Great game that still needs improvements!
27359,This is one of the games you can forget about how long you've been playing because it's so addictive.
27360,great game!
27361,big tower
27362,good
27363,awesome
27364,"I have invested some time into this game and to be honest, the game is fun just the base itself. But I would get any DLC from this game when they are on sale. They are pretty pricey and sometimes not even worth the normal price they are listed.

Is this game better than SimCity (2013)? Well yeah, by a long shot, but it's still not a perfect game. There are some bugs, some weird terrain issues when having certain building have weird slopes.

For DLC, I recommend these:

27368,Fun for first few hours then gets hard and therby bad when a city is evolving
27369,very fun
27370,"A really good game, I really enjoy playing it but in a mode where I can just build without worrying the money.

There are many types of roads, objects that the game lacks, so there's definitely a bunch of mods you should get if you want to build realistically. I give it a 9/10"
27371,i like it. it is perfect for people who want to make a little or big city vitualy
27372,brb
27373,It's an ok city builder
27374,"Best for people that want to be city planners, and want to test the flow of interchanges"
27375,"Great game but I just love city builders. 

Don't try to expand to fast"
27376,build your hometown!
27377,Great

My overall review
Graphics: Lovley
Game Play: Good. 
Sound> Very Good. 
Games last Ability, Depending on the player."
27383,good
27384,"Fantastic base game. I wish that most of the features weren't locked behind $200 of DLC though. What are you gonna do though? Paradox, man."
27385,What a wonderful game. Just brings me so much joy.
27386,fun
27387,Loved the game
27388,"very fun
"
27389,"Descent graphics, lots to keep you busy, can be kinda slow at times but overall not a bad game."
27390,Be prepared to lose hours and be surprised that it is suddenly after 2am.  Great game
27391,its cool so much mods
27392,.
27393,"Awesome game, the mods are definitly nessisary"
27394,"Great way to pass the time, interesting and varied.  Warning:  Do not play this game unless you have plenty of time as hours can pass without the player realising!"
27395,Oh it's good
27396,great game
27397,Make underwater pp for tourism attraction
27398,This game is really fun and I would recomend to all
27399,"If you enjoyed Simcity then you will enjoy Cities Skylines.  It brings back the feel of old sim city with upgraded features and modes,  If there is anything you want or would like that isn't in the game, there is probably a mod for it you can go get."
27400,Very very hard to play when new (i waste my 2.5H for nothing) but Very Fucking fun when u know how to play ps.(u should buy 3 dlc more 1.sunset 2.industie 3.miss transit)
27401,"Cities Skylines is a great addition to the series. As a typical city builder it plays as expected with simple controls  to get around and create your city. There is alot of in-depth game mechanics from creating suburban areas to  taxes, city traffics, Air Pollution and maintaining industry (Industries DLC is a Must have for this part). With DLC you can expand your horizons with creating a more detailed city of your dreams! Graphics are ok but it is a dated game but still much to be enjoyed. 7/10"
27402,yes
27403,"Lumayan lah mengasah otak banget, 10x gagal membuat kota akhirnya sekarang sudah bisa dan tau cara dan trik nya.. Keren grafik nya"
27404,Great city sim
27405,"I didn't intend on making my pc crash while building a humongous MEGAPOLIS
also if you mod it it can be OUR MEGAPOLIS
the Soviet union admires your efforts comrade"
27406,This game's lvl of difficulty lies on how OC you are :P Simply enough but is a bit overwhelming at times.
27407,only got it for 3 days :(
27408,A super chill game that will push you to use your smarts to make a succesful city.
27409,ל
27410,"Roads look REALLY cool on LSD lol
"
27411,"Its A Good Game
"
27412,"The fact that it has kept me entertained for 8+ hours is impressive.  Old game, but still worth a try."
27413,most realistic modern city builder
27414,"If you were into SimCity, CityVille and other classical city building games, then you're going to love this. 

I bought the DLCs, and a lot of people are complaining about it because it's like making the game ""pay-to-play"" but with thousands of mods available in the workshop, the DLCs are optional. The only difference is that sometimes, when you have to download some mods, you have to download a whole pack because one doesn't function without the others.

The game will always keep you busy with a lot of things to manage. It's a more complex but realistic city building game than SimCity or CityVille because of the traffic, electricity, water, garbage, employment, and education systems. There is so much room for creativity when it comes to city design and theme. 

However, I wouldn't say it's worth $15, or in my currency, Php750. Wait for the sale, and I'd say around Php180 or $4 should be the ceiling price"
27415,Everything that Sim City wanted to be
27416,"good game
"
27417,it's fun
27418,nice game
27419,Game is a little confusing at first but great when you get the hang of it
27420,Hell yes.
27421,"this games ok, keeps me captivated"
27422,good
27423,"Watch Move the Mouse videos on YouTube for some of the best tutorials out there.  This game is much easier and much more fun after watching how to play.  I hated it at first, but love it now after following some of the basic tips."
27424,Best city simulation game. 5/5
27425,"What can I say that has not already been said about this game? It's the new Sim City! Doubtlessly the king on the city building hill. Build as realistic or as whimsical as you want! But don't try to build London, that will take an age."
27426,I love build city yes
27427,Its great
27428,"If the number of hours played doesn't say it well enough- very enjoyable, casual game. Feels like a traffic simulator, due to how much importance it carries for just about every aspect of your city, which makes it far more interesting than any SimCity game. Plus, dog parks where you can watch digital furry friends run around!"
27429,"Its what sim city always should have been.

road design and lane management is at the next level, and the community of players is alive and vibrant."
27430,yes
27431,Play you scoundral.
27432,Make city
27433,Good game. Much fun.
27434,the amount of details in this game is just amazing !
27435,love this game
27436,game is good
27437,It's allright I guess

27439,because i said
27440,terrible
27441,Very nice game.
27442,its a good game but it is laggy on my PC
27443,Very detailed game that allows for creativity in game play
27444,Must have if you like city building games. With it's many DLC's there's always something for you. I played many hours to make my city beautiful and prosperous. I love it
27445,Haha city go brrrrr
27446,you loved the old sim city games? you'll love cities: skylines even more!
27447,Best game ever !!!!
27448,"Kills time, beautiful views, and generally just a fun game with a good bit of strategy but not too overwhelming."
27449,I bulldozed a hospital to make room for a highway 10/10
27450,"great game with lots of mods, much better then EA sim city.  lots of mods to customize the game how you prefer"
27451,nice
27452,good
27453,"So I redownloaded this game after a year or so and was surprised to see that ALL BUT 1 VANILLA MAP suddenly required me to have different DLCs to start a game on. That and now I need the Paradox launcher.

I seriously hope it was a mistake on my end because if Paradox is THAT egregious in their business practices they can go fit a skyscraper up their backsides. I'm willing to pay for the lube DLC."
27454,It is a good game but you will need to take some time to make it fun
27455,This is addicting game
27456,"i love thgis game its fun and theres so many possibilitys
"
27457,yummy
27458,"This game sucks.

In a city building sim, limiting your customers is really NOT what you should do. It's complicated, and dealing with bills taxes etc. makes this boring to the moon."
27459,It's epic
27460,Its pretty fun to play when youre bored
27461,very addicting
27462,Yeah its good i guess...
27463,its fun
27464,the better simcity
27465,dis game amazing
27466,hy
27467,Nice
27468,Is good
27469,"This is a pretty good game, but I highly recommend the developers add a better tutorial system. Just getting popups don't really help and there were a lot of things I discovered that I should've discovered earlier in the game which messed me up a lot. Other than that, it's pretty fun to play. I like the variety of achievements you can get and the music is pretty fitting for the game."
27470,"Nice for playing when your Internet is not working.
Mod support is good and enhances the Game."
27471,"Is the game good? Yes. Is it something I recommend? Yes. But often things aren't that simple. It should come with a warning: you might spend a fortune on this game. Like most games you can play for years this one has many DLCs that support it. Most of these DLCs are actual expansions with new game mechanics and content. So for the best experience you would need more than the starting bundle. And to make things worse: Bigger cities need more RAM, they need stronger CPUs, etc. When you have invested a lot of time in a city, it is your pride, it is your joy, but it would work so much better with ""a few more gigabytes"" worth of ram, then you would laugh at the official recommended amount of just 8GB. 

With custom assets (buildings, etc) and district styles, it is pretty easy to get to the point where you just ""need"" more than 32GB... Loading screens can get longer and longer with more resources to load (and use). Some people mention several minutes long loading screens, but it can depend on hardware and on city size."
27472,"its aight
"
27473,"Not bad, actually. The best game if you want to spend your time in front of sandbox full of economy and city building."
27474,c:s + workshop = crack
27475,69
27476,it is a greit afk game and casual
27477,"Pros:
No Microtransactions
Cons:
Can't play it on my phone"
27478,mind usage
27479,"This game has sucked away countless hours of my life, thanks to the workshop and all of the custom assets and mods that can be used. Upon using those mods, you can literally make anything, I'm not joking. This game is much much more than a city-builder. It is a world creator, and every time you play, you feel is though you are entering another universe, one where you are in control. Oh, I guess there is also campaign mode, but that's no fun."
27480,help everyone is dying why is there so much traffic
27481,fun game to kill time
27482,build things good yes thumbs upo
27483,GUT GUT
27484,"It's a good game, yes good game it is."
27485,better then sim city
27486,"This is one of the best city building game I have played since simcity, wish they would release a new one with an updated engine and a few other additions, too many DLC's."
27487,"Probably the most consistent city builder out there, but it's immensely aided by mods. (Seriously, it's impossible to mimic real life cities in any meaningful way without mods, in my opinion.)

Unfortunately the base game is very bare bones and you'd need, I think, 5 or 6 DLC to access what this game does best. That could easily be almost 100€/$ if they're not on sale..."
27488,"Great Game, 
If you want a game to relax, this isn't it
if you have and OCD problem this is greats,
a complex game with a lot of details, i loved how sometimes i can stress myself with decision making
DLC are worth it also"
27489,"If you can manage traffic, you can win"
27490,"this is a great game.The graphic are great, the animation is great and so does the game play. The is fun cause it use brain to play."
27491,fun chill game
27492,"If You Wan't To Learn How To Build A City, This Game Its On"
27493,"Blew over $300 on DLC as a joke during a stream, now i have more content than i understand. 10/10 would go bankrupt again"
27494,Well worthy of the City Building crown formerly owned by Sim City 4
27495,"good game, pretty fun, but road hierarchy is confusing at first if you're not into road designing"
27496,i flooded a city with shit so it is pretty epic
27497,"This game may look puzzling to many at first, but after you play 2 games you'll already understand the basics and get a good idea of what to do. Out of most of the games I've ever played by Paradox I found this one as the most easiest game to get a hang of. This game isn't supposed to be seen as a competitive game, but as a game to have fun and enjoy growing and building cities. One thing that sucks about this game is that you need to install lots of mods and some DLCs to have a good experience playing this game. But overall, I think this game is good to play with family and others."
27498,well thought out game
27499,"People drink poop water hahah
"
27500,I highly recommend this game if you have a passion for city building games. The best city builder I have ever played and it's rivalled by none in my honest opinion.

The game can be played on most computers to start with however as you expand your city expect lag if you aren't on a decent pc. 
If its on sale, I'd give it a buy."

27505,I'm not a huge sim guy but this game is pretty phenomenal. I've had it for years and i've played a bit here and there but i've started to get back into it lately. Definitely worth a buy especially at sale price. Full price is still worth but if you can i'd wait for sales.

27516,BEST CITY BUILDING GAME EVER
27517,Really nice game! Recommend it
27518,Beautiful graphics! It's everything I want in a city building sim!
27519,"This is a review for people who have never played a City manager or a City simulation game before.

City: Skylines DLC I own:
Sunset Harbor
Campus
Industries
Parklife
Mass Transit
After Dark

Will you like City: Skylines? To answer that question, I actually recommend you first purchase the significantly cheaper SimCity 4, Deluxe edition. When Steam sales are occurring, SimCity 4 costs $5, while City: Skylines can cost up to $51 (complete DLC bundle). 

SimCity 4 and City: Skylines, generally, have very similar mechanics. In both games, you can zone as you wish, so areas of land can either consist of residential areas, commercial areas, industrial areas, or a mix of all three. You can optimize roads, rails, and other forms of mass transit to decrease traffic and commute time (some mass transit options are locked behind the Mass Transit DLC in City: Skylines). You can provide your citizens services ranging from simply plumbing to healthcare, education, and tourism. You have to pay attention to citizen happiness so people don't leave your city and people moving in. You can set various city policies, such as taxes and the amount of funding specific city services receive. 

To be clear, City: Skylines is a more in-depth city manager game. For example, your city can be responsible for a supply chain for a certain product, ie both the raw material extraction and the processing of said raw material into something else. My city first started out growing trees and harvesting lumber. As my lumber industry grew, the industry leveled up, providing me access to Paper mills. However, the supply chain aspect is DLC locked (I believe its the industries DLC). In the vanilla game, you simply just zone an area for industry and random industries just pop up themselves, similar to how things are in SimCity 4. Traffic simulations are also more realistic in City: Skylines, and this is thankfully not DLC locked.

Although City: Skylines may be a more in-depth city manager/simulation game, for people who have never played this genre before, dumping $50 just to get a complete experience that you may not end up liking is, in my opinion, a big risk. Since Sim City 4 and City: Skylines (base game, without DLC) have similar mechanics, purchase Sim City 4 first for 1/10 of the price for City: Skylines (when both games are on sale) to see whether you like the genre enough to make the bigger investment in City: Skylines.

As a game, City: Skylines (especially with its DLC) expands beyond the base experience that Sim City 4 provides and is an excellent city simulation game that finally brings the genre to the graphical and complexity standards of 2020, so for people who have played this genre before, I would definitely recommend City: Skylines during sales. Otherwise, the City: Skylines DLC just got too much money, and you kind of need the DLC to get an experience that is more than just a 2020 version of Sim City 4."
27520,"Even after 5 years, this is still the best city builder available today. Number 2 on the list, Caesar III (and this one is 20+ years old). I struggle most with the traffic and getting the monuments (some of the sub-requirements don't make sense or are hard to get if you build efficiently)."
27521,Good game lots of play time!
27522,"Very fun game, somewhat of a learning curve with mods that should be added along with all the shortcuts for keys but. Very fun"
27523,
27524,"The game doesn't really have any objectives, I got bored pretty quickly."
27525,This game is awesome as long as you play with mods. Without mods the game feels like incomplete. It has the best modding community of any game.
27526,love this game been playing it for hours
27527,I love this game :3
27528,"Cities: Skylines has a powerful replay value, with modding up the ass and an excellent game design to entertain you for a while. Wait until this game goes on sale, it's always on sale for $7.49 (or whatever it may be in your region, it's basically always dirt cheap.) Paradox always makes the base game super cheap, so you get reeled in to buy DLC. And yes, Cities: Skylines has plenty of DLC for you to gawk at. Unlike most paradox games, however, you really don't need them all. I always recommend Mass Transit and Industries, as well as After Dark (because it gives the game a night/day cycle, which I'm surprised isn't in the base game lmfao). You'll see most people recommend these three, the others are more down to personal taste tbh.

My biggest gripe with the game, and the biggest limiter to my hours. Is, I don't have a powerful enough PC! You can totally get by fine, but eventually things just clonk up for me. If your pc isn't as strong either, you can expect the same thing. It's just a natural cause of having so much stuff on the screen as your city gets bigger and requires more and more processing power. 
It gets worse when you start modding, which is something I couldn't resist.

Got two monitors? Cities Skylines on one, YouTube on the other. It's a powerful combo. Until your computer gets mad, if it isn't already. It's a relaxing game, and one I can focus on or turn my brain off and just watch my city live and thrive."
27529,"This is a great game, with hours of fun and you can play it anyway you want"
27530,Awesome addictive game. Greatly enhanced with mods.
27531,"the best city builder imo . 
plus MODS!

apart from building a city you can manage roads and footpaths to reduce traffic. which i thought i was fun. being able to see you people walking from their homes to the bridge or tunnel you made to go to the metro to catch a train to work.

you can even build and edit road intersections and roundabouts so you can micromanage traffic

awesome game"
27532,"A good game, without mods can be hard to succeed tho."
27533,j
27534,"A good game, without mods can be hard to succeed tho. Wait for it to go on sale and then by it."

27538,very good game i like thee inferstructer
27539,"The new definitive city builder after Sim City was botched. Original in so many ways, the modding community have also created so many various details and additions that are either needed or fun. Highly recommend."
27540,"This game looks and works like next game in Simcity series should. To bad that we had to wait more than 10 years to get something better than Simcity 4.  What I always like to build in city building games was a working transit system and finally I got tools to build one. With support to mods you can build almost any city you like (visually and technically). This game is what I've been waiting so long. Awesome job!

Pros:
- very good and working transit systems
- mods and community
- possibility to build very detailed city
- curvy roads to give city more natural look 

Cons:
- better get good computer for large city
- DLC are moderate at most but required for most achievements

Overall: 9/10"
27541,its good
27542,실행이 안됌 그래두 괜찮음
27543,Its alright just dont oversave
27544,nice
27545,great simcity replacement.
27546,Nice City Building game
27547,"come a long way since release and seems to keep getting better with every update, the big selling factor has to be attention to detail and the modding community."
27548,"Cities Skylines is a game I both recommend - and don't. Overall, if you're looking for a city builder in 2020, this is really your best bet. However, do be aware that this is a 5 year old game that - in all due honesty (I love this game dearly), needs to stop getting DLC updates and just get a sequel. While that may just be a trope of Paradox games, after so many DLC packs of mixed quality, it becomes a bit ridiculous that you have to pay as much as you do to fully experience the game. 

Like I said, if you're absolutely [i]dying[/i] for a city builder, go ahead. I'd recommend. If you can wait, I'd hold it out till a sequel. If you ARE going to get this game, I would say that the community workshop mods/assets for this game are AWESOME and it is genuinely difficult to play this game without them. While Colossal has made many quality of life improvements over the years, and the vanilla base game isn't quite as bad as it started out with [i]cough[/i] traffic management, the mods available are great and when put to use can help you make some really awesome cities. 

Additionally, I'd recommend the following DLC: After Dark, Mass Transit, and any one of the post-Parklife DLC's that helped freshen up those aspects of the game (Campus and Industries being the other two). The others really are just aesthetic and are fine, but don't add too much to the game. 

Keep in mind, me not recommending this game is not me saying it's a bad game. It isn't. I just feel, at this point, you're gonna be better off waiting for ""Cities Skylines 2"" which is certainly bound to happen eventually. I think Colossal and Paradox have made a great community and game overall, and I do commend for that. Just, there's far too much of a premium of entry at this point for me to warrant a recommendation."
27549,i love this game
27550,Very Good Game!
27551,This is a good game
27552,Good game.
27553,The best and most comprehensive city building game around. Mods and custom buildings make it versatile and adaptable.
27554,"nothing like building a giant poop hole and drowning all my people with their own sewage

27555,"This is an awesome game, but that has been said hundreds of times already. I have watched people play this game for hours and I do enjoy them. At the time of typing this I don't have the computer that I would like to have to be able to build the city that I would like to with the mods that are out there. The community behind this game is amazing, they show so much love for this game, and it is awesome to see."

27557,"Always loved this game. Always will, hoping for a sequel."
27558,Recommend game for future architecturer  and people play similar game like The Sim....

27567,Addicting.
27568,"Much like Sim City, only a little more updated. If you like Sim City you will like this game. There's also a built in unlimited money mode for folks who just like watching a city build itself up."
27569,Great game but Paradox's DLC policy is fucking outrageous. Literally $180 to buy it all
27570,"Its hard game to figure out. Theres quite a few issues with it. However if you watch some videos say biffas videos for example, things can get quite manageable. I think the game almost requires mods to be played however. But i do love this game and am enjoying the heck out of it over 100 hrs in. Still feels like i barely grasp most the concepts though even with all the time played ."
27571,"I was looking for a game similiar to SimCity ever since i bought a MacBook. All i can say is wow, this game is far superior to SimCity. The graphics are amazing, and you tweak and play around with just about any aspect of your city. This game is my favorite game ever. Props to the developers in charge of the little things, like Cim animations, vehicle design, weather, etc."

27576,It's an awesome game and I think a lot of people would like it for its realism and stuff.
27577,"Definitely would recommend for those who are into the whole ""simulator"" and ""building"" thing. IT's really awesome seeing your city evolve and grow over time. There is a few bugs at some points but they are easily avoidable. Can be a bit stressful with civilian complaints, BTW."
27578,Fantastic. Very deep and rewarding gameplay
27579,AWESOME CITY SIM
27580,like sim city but with more of the nity grity stuff
27581,fun
27582,love it
27583,This game is great except for when you mess with the water. Never mess with the water.
27584,"You can build your city, start out quite vanilla and keep on improving. Add mods to make it prettier or make it harder or to make it easier. Tip: start with just the game, add on when needed. (Visit Reddit for tips)"
27585,"Coming from SimCity 8 this is a major improvement. Graphics are really good and building is smooth and easy. My only complaint is the game isn’t optimized well. I have a pretty good pc and FPS is rather low for what it’s rendering. Luckily low FPS isn’t very noticeable with this game for some reason, and I’ve also never noticed screen tearing even with vsync off. Other than that I recommend this game it’s quite fun!"
27586,"Simcity figured out how to make a game like this fun 20 years ago.  Why can't you.  The first 20 minutes is confusing and tedious.  I guess I've played this over 4 hours and still hate it.  I don't have the time to spend hours learning a game and figuring out where the ""fun"" is

The roads and zones don't even line up when adding to existing ones.. over 20 years ago this worked perfectly"
27587,city go boom ha people drinkin poop 5 star
27588,takes a while to get used to but it is a very fun game please buy only $7.49 winter sale don't buy the deluxe for $10 though all you get is soundtrack

27590,love it
27591,"Good, Can't get the roads right but ah well..."
27592,Great game!!! Love it mush better than SimCity
27593,"Ever since the first 286 we had in the very early 90's I knew I was more into simulators and city builders than any fighting/shooting game. I think I played them all, the original Sim Cities, Sim Farms, Sim Ants, Sim Moons, Railroad Tycoon, if there was a sim game, I played it.

After all intervening years I decided to look into gaming and after I bought a Playstation with GTA5 I decided I probably got too old and 14-year olds were calling the tune in the game world. Boy was I wrong.

Cities: Skylines is just such a joy to explore. I watched a ton of videos by Biffa and others, and I learned a lot about the game before even plaing it. As it turns out, they actually make the game more intimidating, because you see all those perfect cities and then you look at your own little wreck... Well, no matter.

I did get most of the DLC's in sales, and while they do enhance the game (and allow you to do stuff the guys on Youtube are doing), the game is perfectly playable as it is. It brought back the joy of sim gaming for me and I'm loving it."
27594,"My traffic flow sucks, my industrial area is extremely toxic and I killed half my population with a misplaced water tower over ground pollution. 10/10 would play even more."
27595,Best city builder on the market. Combine this game with a few essential mods and you have a city builder you can play for hundreds of hours.
27596,nice
27597,yes
27598,"I like it, though, I feel like the natural disasters dlc should be basegame"
27599,If you want to have a chill game session this game is for you once you get the handeling of the game its easy but thats obviously with every game if you want to fuck around in this game too? go ahead there is no stopping you ;D

27604,"Fun but addictive. Scenario's could be a lot shorter in length (playtime). Getting all expansions (some pretty required to play the game these days) can be a bit expensive as well, even in sale. Some dont offer that much extra compared to workshop items either."
27605,It's the go-to game for any city management game.

27619,Best game for building a city.

27649,Great game if you love the intricacies of developing a city from scratch
27650,I like throwing meteorites at cities of innocent civilians.
27651,i like it
27652,City skylines is maybe the greatest game for city building. (Since there is no big competition in that genre)
27653,Its perfect if your looking to build your city
27654,"So far having a wonderful experience with this game. I won't lie, it's a little tricky to get used to, and it takes a lot of thinking on how to manage the 70k you start with. It's easy to go bankrupt and it's easy to go wild building roads and wanting to expand like crazy, but it turns out that's a huge mistake. Whatever you do, start as little as possible and take huge baby steps. All that aside, this game is a must buy. If you're into building and managing a budget, this is for you."
27655,Everything Sim City should have been.
27656,Great Game
27657,Just amazing
27658,"9/10 can kill 40,000 people in a flood"
27659,"Addicting, amazing unique take on the city building game community, must have for any Simcity fan, as it shows that there is a lot more to see from the city building world. 11/10."
27660,"Grew up with playing Simcity, this exceeded my nostalgic experiences of that game"
27661,smol town -> big town = good
27662,not bad
27663,Best city building game I've played. A place where your creativity will never end but your computer will. Definitely try building a vanilla city and then a modded one. You can even get more detailed by creating your own assets and with workshop content.
27664,it takes a few to get the hang of it but its very enjoyable
27665,if you dont like this game i'll raise your taxes
27666,It's okay I guess
27667,This game is amazing! You get to create your own city BUT you also have to manage it. The good thing about this game is that there is a unlimited money mode.
27668,It makes me not bored. :)
27669,"This game is great.

With thousands upon thousands of reviews, here is an honest one.

I am not the kind of person who downvotes because a launcher is within the game to help it run better.

When I first got Cities:Skylines I got it on the XBox One. With this there were tons and tons of possibilities, but I soon noticed that the XBox series was being neglected and wasn't really cared for by Paradox.

So I got on to steam one day and went to the store and got it on sale along with some other DLC.
Luckily C:S is not a DLC hog like EA, but there are some attributing factors to the game that DLC fulfills. 

Graphics are nice and installing shaders makes the game all the more better. 
In my opinion however some areas are very odd, mountains will sometimes have super dark spots where the sun hits, (maybe just my graphics card sucking idk?). Which kinda makes it hard to see and get good screenshots.

The gameplay that goes along is very nice and realistic, you can't have a trash dump right next to residentials, and it makes it realistic and somewhat enjoyable.
Installing mods for vehicles makes the game look 200% better since I can make an american city and not have a german fire engine and a french ambulance driving around.

Sustaining population isn't too hard, and having the option to have unlimited money can give a nice touch and make a utopia all the more easier.

Finally, I come to a bad section. 
Recently, there have been a lot of false or botted reviews that have driven this game into the dirt.
The top one is by someone I will not mention that regards the C:S launcher. While the C:S launcher can be a tiny bit annoying it's perfectly safe. In fact I have had easier times getting into C:S and have not had the same amount of crashes that I used to have.

All in all, I give this game, a 10/10."
27670,Very addicting and really fun!
27671,Why build a city when you can destroy it.
27672,"Cities Skylines is not only one of the most well rounded and easy to get into city builders, it also has an incredibly active and innovative community which is constantly working on new assets and mods. There's always something new to do!

It just does not get old"
27673,"yeahs 
"
27674,I love city builders and this one is no different! I get sucked in to designing and managing my own city!
27675,"This is the city-builder I've always wanted!  Mods for every occasion, and a developer that actually listens to its players.  Can't recommend enough!"
27676,"Great game, deep gameplay, intense detail."
27677,e
27678,Its a fun game for people who enjoy Simcity and city building type games. There is a lot of variety and options in the game.
27679,Great city builder!
27680,VERY NICE
27681,great graphics
27682,"tried re-downloading, cant even start up because paradox launcher v2 download ended prematurley. hope paradox fixes this."
27683,"It goes without saying that this game is the best city builder on the market these days. It does however also make you go ""just one more round!"" like no other game. The problem is there are no rounds, and its 4 AM. Help!"
27684,"The game is great. Whilst Paradox are unfortunately trying to run the game dry with DLC, just wait until it's on sale and don't pick any DLC up if it has a Mixed feedback or lower. The earlier DLC is generally the better stuff.

There is something to be said about making a city and then only realising all the terrible mistakes you made in the road design, and the continually ""improving"" it (read: bodge job) and praying that it lasts long enough to not cause a queue throughout your whole city when you build the next industrial estate."
27685,Highly recommended for players who love to build cities to scale. Details in this game is simply awesome and realistic. Having a high specs GPU will only enhance the quality of the graphics in this game.
27686,dont uninstall assets...
27687,"This game got me through some bad times (broken hand). I was able to kill time until i was healed.
Also very relaxing and therapeutic even. I dont really like all the DLC stuff but i can get by with the basic stuff just fine."
27688,cashgrab
27689,"Another game sold in dlc kits ...
"
27690,"too hard for low iq chi very hard to make town go money :(

6/10 eh"
27691,good game
27692,"I've spent far too many nights trying to fix my transport systems.
Addictive in a Factorio kind of way.
Definitely recommended to anyone new or experienced with city builders."
27693,"Playstyle is very relaxed, especially in sandbox mode with infinite terrain movement and resources. It works well for those who tend to focus on building pretty, practical cities over a career mode but can also be played that way as well. I would hands down recommend C:S over its SimCity counterparts, simply on that basis alone. 

While it is a great game there are many pros and cons:

(Some) Pros:
- Game is nowhere near as expensive as the SimCity counterpart, especially when on sale.
- When playing, you aren't restricted in terms of content. While DLC can be pricey, if you can pick it up on sale, it adds just that little bit extra to the game, not to mention the thousands of available mods on the workshop.
- Gameplay mechanics focus more on practicality, infrastructure and urban movements than class division, building design and AI happiness 
- Game is constantly receiving updates and new DLC and there is no plan to drop these anytime soon.

(Some) Cons:
- Graphical engine is good, but is starting to show its age. System requirements can also be ridiculous when you start installing mods, actively using in excess of 16GB of RAM. This also extends to FPS, which can regularly drop into low teens when in high density zones, even with high end video cards and decent CPUs.
- Despite adding to the game (in my opinion), DLC can be overly expensive for little return. I would only recommend buying it if it goes on sale for 50% off (or more).
- Some mods require certain DLC to work, likely due to aspects of mod assets requiring DLC mechanics to work (usually only applies to ""After Dark"" DLC)
- Game tends to break savegames, likely due to bugfixes and regular content updates, which is amplified when installing and using mods. 

As a whole, Cities: Skylines is an amazing game that completely hammers the SimCity titles. Where the game really wins is with its modularity, customization and overall approach to practicality.

Graphical Beauty: 7.5/10
Performance: 6.5/10
How Modifiable: 9/10
Gameplay Difficulty: Easy
Learning Curve: Easy/Fast
Worth the Price: Yes
Replayability: 7/10
Multiplayer: No

Verdict: good way to waste 9 hours and learn something about traffic management (that the local council can't seem to grasp) in the process."

27708,"Cities Skylines is Colossal Order's response to the failure of SimCity 2013, taking many elements from that game and expanding upon it to give the player a much better experience than the latter: larger maps, more customisation, more replay value, along with many elements missing from the SimCity series that fans had missed.

Although it is a great game, it does has some flaws. The game was made by a small team and, although it plays amazingly, the simulation aspect can be a bit flawed, ironically mostly with traffic, despite the team creating Cities in Motion, a game centred around transportation. The visuals also leave a bit to be desired. The art style strays away from realism, especially with the zoned buildings. There are scaling issues and the futuristic and colourful aspect of the cities doesn't really appeal to me. Don't expect CBDs filled with skyscrapers either, as the game only has a couple, and none grow organically. Only some stubby postmodern highrises spawn. If you have the Green Cities DLC, the IT clusters have a few skyscrapers.

Speaking of, there are a few too many DLCs. Most of the main ones are worth buying when they go on sale, as they all have at least a few noteworthy features. Sunset Harbour, the latest one, doesn't bring much, however, with most useful features coming for free with the update. I'd say Industries, Campus and Park Life are the ones I use the most. The community made ones I find a bit sub par. The assets are not as good as the ones on the workshop and the buildings spawn randomly within your city, affecting the cohesiveness of it.

There is a huge modding community for this game and custom assets have fixed most of the gripes I had with the visuals of the vanilla ones. Some mods attempt to fix the simulation aspect of the game too, but even with a load of mods, the amount of vehicles the game spawns and the way they act can be problematic and confusing, not to mention the fact that having too many mods can break the game if you're not careful.

The game is quite GPU heavy, as it maxes out my 6 GB card and heats it up to over 60°C just by playing a city. A large city will unavoidably tank your framerate. If you have a lot of assets, expect long loading times, over three minutes, and even fewer frames. However, there are mods that can increase the framerate and internal resolution as well if you wish.

If you're looking for a vanilla experience, I'd actually recommend the console version of this game. It was ported by another studio, Tantalus, and it was done quite well. I played the PS4 version extensively before purchasing a PC powerful enough to run the game decently. The game controls well on a controller and the camera is surprisingly easy to get used to. There are also a few exclusive features on console, such as a tree and bulldozer brush that are only available through mods on PC. My favourite exclusive feature is the driving and walking mode, that makes it possible to explore your city on foot and by car. You can even fly around as a bird. The visuals are a little downgraded and only nine tiles are usable, but the game is just as fun to play as the PC version.

Overall, despite my issues with it, Cities Skylines is one of my favourite games and I've had many hours of fun with it.I recommend this game to anyone who enjoys creating. The game put the final nail in the coffin of the SimCity series and gracefully succeeded it. I think the game could've been even better with a larger budget and more focus on simulation and optimisation, so I'd like to see what a sequel could bring to the table."
27709,"8.5/10
It good :)"
27710,I swear you just cant get your hands off this game. Buy it no matter its on sale or not.
27711,It's okay.
27712,good game even tho im trash at making cities
27713,GUFE8WGYRAFIDSHG87FEWYH8V7GT
27714,Poggers game
27715,This game is a fun way to waste time! I recommend the DLCs.
27716,england is my city
27717,"This game is good as a time killer, I would recommend it if you have a day all to yourself."
27718,"Make sure you have a great processor, i have a old computer, so im trying to keep it on low settings. if you have a great processor, then why worry? it'll be ok."
27719,Good Game
27720,"Everytime I think about coming back to this game, I feel like I'm playing a barebones version because I don't have any DLC and there is no affordable DLC pack or anything"
27721,yaaa
27722,the game is good
27723,9/10
27724,"Fun, but can be laggy at times.

27725,"I is good godo games,but gaty"
27726,Great game fun and lets your city building imagination run wild!
27727,very good you should get
27728,"Very fun if you're looking for a good city sim. If you get into modding, it also has soooooooo much content. I've been loving playing over the Yule break"
27729,city game is goob
27730,yes
27731,yes
27732,Awesome Game!
27733,Addictive - I blinked and accidentally played for 8 hours straight. Even better with mods and DLC.
27734,The road and metro rail placement are unusable at any level of refinement.
27735,I can see that it will be easy to lose hundreds of hours in this game. I love builders but have had problems getting into SimCity. Skylines seems to be different. Time will tell!
27736,tsunami killed everybody much sad

27741,this sucks
27742,its fun what can i say
27743,e
27744,Best city builder out there (in my opinion).
27745,"This is probably the best city building game made so far.  The steam workshop also has countless mods, buildings and maps for you to add to the game for free.  You can choose to play with infinite money if you just want to build, or increase the difficulty if you want more.  Highly recommended if you like city building games"
27746,"well built, easy to mod and gain assets, easy to use, i love the game
"
27747,yes
27748,I am a micromanaging perfectionist and lose massive chunks of time to this game every time i play.
27749,Very Nice! i like it the graphics and everything..Even physics is involved!
27750,Great games!
27751,"OVERALL I PERSONALLY THINK TO BE A VERY ENJOYABLE AND  FAIRLY WELL ORGANIZED.
I RECOMMEND TO ALL THAT ARE INTERESTED!"
27752,This game is what Sim City could have been.   I love the amount of customization and how you can actually expand your city to a whole region.  I find that I spend entire days playing this game.
27753,"Good lockdown escapism. Get the bundle with the DLC (Mass Transit, Sunset Harbour, Industries) plus Green Cities."
27754,"I like it, it is good city builder"
27755,"New player to the game and to Steam, bought it on sale for $8.  I had an itch to play a city building game, and after reading terrible reviews about the Sim City 2013 game, I decided to try this out instead.  It took me a couple of hours to get the hang of things and develop a good strategy, but now that I'm catching on, I will say that it is enjoyable.  Definitely the type of game that makes you lose track of time."
27756,"This game is amazing I love it. Im playing on a mac so its hard to fins good games and i found this one on sale, I never thought that 
 I would be playing a game like this on a mac. Sure theres some lag but it's fine.   my city ran out of electricity/10"
27757,passes alot of time and then you sit there thinking about how you just spend hours on something that doesn't matter and how you should be doing something productive instead of making a fake city but then you take another dab and keep playing anyway
27758,A great city building game.
27759,a fun game that passes time and is fun.
27760,The best one of its kind.
27761,"One of the best city builder game i had ever play. I definitely recommended for those who want to tryout this game . Everything seems to be too realistic especially the city building , transport , disaster , etc...quite satisfy especially you just need to find ways to earn more income to build more cities ,unlike sim city building apps which require times and quite troublesome for the waiting time to build up each and every building"
27762,Love it
27763,Ddude you can buikld bossniiaa HELL YEAH BOSNIA A GANGAGG!!!!!
27764,If you liked playing SimCity then this will be your new jam!
27765,Traffic Flow... must... get... over 90%...
27766,"Amazing city-builder. Would recommend waiting for a sale and buying it then, as you can get it quite cheap. I got it for 75% off."
27767,very fun if u like city builers or slow paced rts
27768,nice building game
27769,the simcity we wanted
27770,Addictive!
27771,Fun game. Very intricate.
27772,Ram Katili Olması Gayet iyi bir oyun
27773,i like the freedom of creativity of building with this game and the use of some dlc but mainly the custom content really have helped me enjoy this game
27774,kaupunki simulator
27775,"good
"
27776,Pretty good city building sim. Lots of great mod support in the workshop. Good DLC's as well. All around great time builder. ++ Reccomend
27777,best city game ever. you get carried away playing this. 5 hours feels like 5 minutes. its fun with mods.
27778,Better than Sim City
27779,"good game :)
"
27780,"Workshop>>>>>overpriced DLCs.
The good:
-Performs well considering the potential scale of the game
-You can name almost everything in the game, even crap tier streets
-Careful planning is needed
-A lot of mods
The bad:
-A.I is dumb AF
-Population has a lot of whiney first world problems and complaints. Chirper sucks
-Garbage accumulation and old age deaths are all timed and not random at all..resulting to garbage apocalypse and death waves
-Water physics are annoying

My entire game time is just one city....the game is further improved by mods. Just don't stack up on them because having too many assets slows loading even in an SSD and finding a problem with them is annoying

"
27781,impossible to get rid of not enough workers
27782,Itd cost you $200+ to unlock the full game
27783,Game is great fun and time killer.
27784,This game is addicting and very challenging.  It is very satisfying when you figure out how to correct a problem that is slowing your growth rate down.  You must be patient while watching your city grow.  Slow and steady!
27785,BEST GAME EVER! :D
27786,"Decent game with tons of mods if your into city planning go for it but the game has you manage so many things at once and can make the game unplayable if you don't know what your doing
"
27787,"Poorist game I.ve seen in 35 years. Sim City would be a wonton crumb if it had an interface, let alone a tutorial like this. Garbage."
27788,Fun for the first hour or so.
27789, good game may be hard to run for some pcs but really good game
27790,5/7 perfect score
27791,..
27792,"If you want to build a city from the ground up, this is the game for you it is a good game You can have a good city or become a dictator and to add the spice you can have mods too!"
27793,"Great game. Especially with the dlc, it really lets you dream big, if you can survive the never ending battle with traffic."
27794,"This one hits all the notes of quickly becoming my newest addiction. That being said, it is great. Its creative and beautiful. Both complex yet simple at the same time. I don't think I'm very good at it but I will keep playing."
27795,"played it for a few minutes, it's alright ig"
27796,Awesome Game!!!
27797,its a video game
27798,"its just addicting. its really satifying to play and still privides alot of play time. it definitly has way too many dlc's that should just be included in the main game, but still, its  a really well done game
"
27799,k
27800,"This game is for people who love taking the time to build, it expands their creativity. i love it
"
27801,good
27802,"YES
"
27803,"Every time I load a save or create, there is about a 50% chance that the game crashes. I had fun on it up until that point."
27804,"This is a fantastic re-envisioning of everyone's beloved city builder from decades ago, but the single problem it has is enough to totally lose my interest:
It's basic design is that of a mobile game, with it ""unlocking"" buildings as your city essentially gets XP. You can never actually plan your city out, because in order to get access to effective buildings, your population needs to grow. Then, by the time you have access to useful buildings and road types, you essentially have to decide if you're going to uproot your original city, or just leave it as a useless historic district, but either way I feel like I always end up with a huge, effective city built around the grave of an awkward, tiny hamlet."
27805,great game
27806,"very nice and relaxing can also be fun to torment the citizens, shows me why i should be incharge of things"
27807,"It's a great game to sink hours of time into, but I wouldn't call it a great city simulator. It's fairly limited without mods, the finicky road building tools are atrocious, the music can get grating after some time, and the traffic can get insane."
27808,"Nice visual, loads of customizations if you are on PC, and endless hours of fun."
27809,"As a first time player, I found this game to be both entertaining and informative. I've learned a lot about what goes into city planning while also being to relive fond memories of playing Sims 3 growing up - only this time I always seem to have garbage issues and run out of money every week haha"
27810,fun
27811,"Its a good game, the DLC Is overpriced unless its on a major sale, very similar to the last sim city game, gets old after a few hours"
27812,it's cool
27813,"It's what every city builder ever wanted. The modder community is amazing too. If you feel like you want an economy game, this is the best buy. If you want to build something beautiful, this is an amazing choice. 10/10"
27814,"its a real good sim 
one down fall is the dlcs dont %100 work it says i dont own them\




(fixed)"
27815,good
27816,Everything a simulation city builder should be unlike Sim City or a terrible mobile game
27817,"Love the game but not in his original format. Vanilla play is terrible and far from realist. 

With a good amount of Mods and Assets, CS is really a fun and absorbing game. The engine is very complete and complexe ( more with many good DLC ) and tend to improve during the years.

I think it's time for a sequel and a brand new base-game with all the experiences the dev team got over the year. :)

"
27818,Its a good game to play when your just trying to relax
27819,I like the game :D
27820,"Paradox is all-in with the DLC approach to extracting money from players, and it shows in the way the basic engine of the game functions. Don't get me wrong, there's lots of great things about CS, but to be honest a huge fraction of them come from the community of modders. And the underlying engine of CS just does not handle all that content very well.
It's my general policy NOT to buy DLC to fix the problems in the vanilla game, and I haven't bought any of CS' DLCs- in part because what I read suggests they won't fix the fundamental issues with the game.

Since the game is heavily mod-oriented, it's unfortunate that managing mods and content frequently results in the game freezing and crashing. A lot of people are doing excellent work for free for Paradox, but the company can't be bothered to make a system that doesn't seize up when it sees something unexpected. 

If Paradox gets into the guts of their engine and makes it functional, I'd be glad to recommend it, but as it is, it's a tedious and frustrating game to deal with."
27821,"good
"
27822,Great city building game to play while ignoring life's problems
27823,"Amazing city builder. Very customizable via mods. Great traffic simulator. 
It can eat up your CPU and/or RAM once the city gets somewhat big. 

Highly recommended."
27824,"Amazing game, the only limit to how far you can push the game is your computer."
27825,9 out 10 meows
27826,Brilliant
27827,It's a fun game to play.
27828,One of the best modern city builders I've seen.
27829,"I have spent hours laying out roads, creating exits, setting up mass transit networks, reshaping the landscape with rail and sea routes. By the time I'm done with that, I sometimes don't even let people move in. I realize I spent 3 hours trying to get the best possible curve on a single onramp from my future oil community and don't have any more time left to play the game itself.

You have to get mods. Google it or check out reddit (which has a great C:S community). They're essential to enjoying the game even more."
27830,Better than SiMcItY
27831,
27832,This game is amazing and can be for all to enjoy! It brings certain perspectives to play within the game. It also has fantastic scenery.
27833,Wanted to play this for years... now I have a computer able to play it and I love it!!
27834,"yes, pc go brrr when bad optimization, temp fix https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2105755179"
27835,The best city builder! My people are happy and I am the best mayor in the world. I bult ice creram parlors for them and they love their mayor! If they are good I will build MacDonalds restaurant too.
27836,Super great game!
27837,"Soooo, I am a massive Sim City 4 fan, I was sceptical at first, but I have grown to love Cities, it great for me as I loved CiM and Sim City and its a nice amalgamation of the both, don't get me wrong some items such and restrictions on zoning take some time to get used to but once I had a handle on things I really do like it. I've been playing for near 56 hours and I am still learning new little features etc and experimenting."
27838,ywa
27839,yis very gud game
27840,"The sky is not the limit with Skylines, I have not being playing it for very long but enjoy it immensely. Started playing Simcity back in the nineties and other similar games, I have found Skylines to be the least restrictive in game play,  and I am yet to feel there is a limit to what you want to do or what you want to plan. If you are willing to do the research and go over the tutorials more than twice, there is nothing that can't be done, even a creator tool. What more could any one want in a Sim game. ( Maybe some of our city planers need to try this before they are let loose on our cities, and my wife thinks it should be mandatory lol)"
27841,Just great relaxing game with unimaginable creativity
27842,its great
27843,Brilliant Game
27844,"FUN

27845,This and Simcity 4 is best city building game out there!
27846,"Best city building and management I've ever seen, so detailed you spend hours and hours taking care of your village :)))"
27847,8/10
27848,"A City building game that works, cant say enough good things about this game"
27849,"A bit of a learning curve, but once you get the hang of it it's an easy way to sink some hours :)"
27850,One of the best city sim game but you'll have to get dlc else playing base game is pointless
27851,"Whoa. I abandoned this game for a couple of years only to find out that all sorts of DLCs have come out for it. Come to think of it, I understand why Paradox won't release a new version of the game (with more realistic spacing and better traffic behavior). The game is good enough as it is and the DLCs just keep making it better. I know, people keep complaining about the DLCs being a money grab but then I think of FIFA, for example, releasing a brand new game each year with only a handful improvements - maybe they should be releasing DLCs. All in all, yeah, it is a money grab but that's what businesses are in the business of - money. That said, they only get mine if they put out a good product and I think this is a great product. The mod community is incredible. With all the DLCs this game is incredibly detailed, endless hours of entertainment. It is well worth it."
27852,"I genuinely don't understand how this game has such poor optimization when its the LEAST demanding of ALL of paradox's games. The Frame rate stops for drive-thru most of the time and it drops from a clean 60 to 10 within 30 mins of consistent play. HOI4 and Stellaris can at least keep consistent frame rates, even towards the endgame. Not recommending until its fixed."
27853,is aight
27854,One of the best city builder games
27855,"Although i'm not as creative as the youtubers I can still have fun. Awesome game very detailed but also simple. 10/10

 Don't download to much stuff on the workshop lol"
27856,"This game is amazing and really fun. However, please be careful when installing mods and assets from the workshop. It's a pain in the a**. Every time they update the game which is frequently, mods tend to break. Also please be aware that some mods also can cause fps drops. I do recommend this game. It's fun to play around with a design cities. Just do not download to much content or your game will take ages to load or the map will fail to load properly."
27857,"If you like City builders, you'll love Cites: Skylines. 

The most in depth city builder on the market with the best modding community and support. Every minute of this game has been enjoyable. 

If you have a computer with less than 8gb of ram, please, please, please, wait til you get more before buying they game. You can get away from playing base game Cites: Skylines with the recommended specs, but playing with DLC + mods is going to be a pain or downright impossible.

And for once in my life, I also recommend buying the DLC too. After Dark, Campus, Mass Transit, and Parklife are my favorite. (You should get them in that order too. A good portion of mods require After dark, but you don't NEED it.)

And I highly recommend taking a look at the workshop if you do, great stuff their to increase the depth of you city building. 

Just keep in mind this isn't a ""management"" game, but it does have some elements of city management.,  its primarily about building a beautiful metropolis.


And as a FYI for if you do buy the game. Please take a look at the discussions for modding, its very helpful info."
27858,"this game is fun as hell, I just wish that it utilizes my system better especially multiple cores."
27859,My traffic is literally killing my citizens but I can't stop playing. 10/10.
27860,lit
27861,This games meh without any dlc's imo. I aint tryna spend over 100 dabloons on them tho so yeah... Prolly would only buy the game if on sale for under 10.
27862,"Good brain workout (lots off planning and logical thinking) addictive, great graphics. Way better with mod tools   though cause the ai traffic jams are ridiculous and population mods cause who needs a city sized commercial district for a population of 1000. So get the mods! Thanks to all mod creators out there too by the way."

27869,"Once you learn more how to play effectively it's a pretty fun game, I like that there is more control over things than in Sim City."
27870,this is so much fun and worth every penny! i played sims city for years and this game outshines simcity in every way. from the graphics to actual game  play. i love it so much i have it across multiple platforms!
27871,You constantly make things better by fixing the mistakes you made last time you tried to make things better
27872,more fun then it looks (more fun then it should be)
27873,it's alright
27874,"its a lot of fun to play with friends and just mess around with the game mechanics. the mechanics are quite realistic and you can really do whatever you want, although it can be a bit laggy because there is so much to render. make ssure you have decent specs before you buy it."
27875,Good game

27885,"At least 10% of my play time has been spent trying to perfect the entrance roundabout to my to-be settlement and then giving up. Apparently, even with all the ""road anarchy"" and road type mods, it's completely impossible to make perfectly smooth junctions for roundabouts.

If you ever wanted to develop OCD, this is the perfect game for it. If you already have OCD and are looking for something to bring yourself closer to a quick game of sudoku no scope, this is a game for you.

...the rest of my play time has been spent trying to not care."
27886,"traffic is shit? just make a roundabout
no medics? roundabout
no education? scho... no, roundabout
it should have Yes - Fragile playing on the radio for the forsaking amount of roundabouts i've done in this game"
27887,Good
27888,"This is a really fun and interesting game. You will likely never run out of things to do in your city. There are a lot of options and routes for entertainment and advancement. With the modding abilities through steam workshop, it is extremely simple and easy to mod the game into an even more enjoyable experience. However, the base game is still very fun to play."

27898,"I bought all dlc, then proceeded  to build a city. The city was run by large government corporations, and regular corporations. The treasury and citizen happiness was so great, I funded a mega dam project.

I realized though that the water level could not get high enough, so I closed the area off and started using sewage to fill up to level.

Right before it reached production level an earthquake occured right on the dam, breaking it. An 8 story flood wiped my city out.

10/10 would recommend again, tho good advice, avoid building large dams on low lying cities. Your future self will thank you for this. Unless... you want to recreate what I experience lol."

I get 45 frames per second on Fallout 4, but my peak on this game is 19 frames per second. However, I put both games at low settings. I just got sick of it. I did have a good time playing it though, but I just can't stand low frames per second. I don't think this is the developer's fault, but my fault for using a bad computer."
27910,"Brother,you right there reading this comment, imma tell you: if you like to build and manage B I G things, dont hesitate and buy this game... would recommend to every person that likes to create but beware: sometimes things can take a little turn, if you dont pay attention"

27912,"Got this game when it first came out, played it for a while and thought it was nice just needed a little work to bring it up to SC4 depth. Decided to shelve it for a while and see if an expansion or two would come out to make it even better. (This was before I knew what it meant to be a Paradox game.)

Got the itch to play this again and check the updates.....

Nope.

Nope.

Nope.

Half off and it's still a hundred bucks to make feature complete? Not gonna happen."
27913,Best game
27914,Very nice indeed

27938,"An incredibly fun and relaxing game. Good graphics. enjoyable gameplay loop and interesting 'deep enough, but not too much to overwhelm you' mechanics. I mean it is THE city builder game on the market as far as 2020 goes.

The only downside is road/traffic management. When your city grows it turns from a relaxing game into a hell of gihway building. The people in the game don't really 'travel' and the way traffic is formed is counter intuitive at best. No matter how hard I tried I could not solve the traffic problem completely. I mean it is somewhat realistic, not like it is solved in real world so I guess can't complain. I just wish there would be more meaningful and user friendly ways to control it.

Highly recommend."
27939,It's just fun.
27940,"insanely complete and full!! every aspect of the tool system has been thouroughly thought out.

cities is by far the best money i have spent on a game in ages. gavent felt more complete in a while"
27941,"The game itself is good but it lacks optimization, a Ryzen 7 3700x is at 70 - 90% on my big city ...
"
27942,"Yes! I highly recommend Cities & Skylines! But, this report is directed more towards the developers of the game. As I do own both Switch and PC versions of this game and have been an avid builder for quite sometime, I loaded into the PC version, only to have the error code: 12-28-20 appear and a request to submit a crash report.

I seriously thank the development team for all of the hard work and dedication put forth to make this sim happen. Thank you!"
27943,better than simcity 5
27944,"Completely unrealistic idea of how much their items cost, not to mention randomly increasing how much money is taken out even after shutting all services down to 50% and raising taxes to twenty percent. Just not fun and more stressful."
27945,very boss game
27946,its super realistic.....................................
27947,poop
27948,better than sims sity game!

27952,Dont build dams and ur good.
27953,"This game is hard to put down ounce you get the hang of it. I'm 58 of age and  I find it relaxing ang challening and my wife loves when I'm creating or finishing a Town, City or fixing the traffic."

27955,"Amazing game, very detailed."
27956,"Does not come with natural disasters DLC D:< and I bought the disasters dlc to test out the tsunami, did not work under any conditions :("
27957,good
27958,The game gives you freedom to create whatever you want. A small town or a big metropolitan area
27959,"This is THE BEST city builder out there, no rly, i aint shittin ya, THE BEST"
27960,"this game is absoloutley AMAZING,  you like citys? arcitechture? strategy? this game is PERFECT!!!"
27961,Love the game! So many great features and tons of fun to learn the economy system
27962,Amazing Game with loads of creative ways to build a city. you need high level tech to truly enjoy it to the max but the game is a blast to play.
27963,"I flooded my city with shit, because I looked away from my man-made hole for 5 minutes. 10/10."
27964,Challenging and fun
27965,Cities Skylines is a great sim for starters and you can do lots more like building your city and mod it! I'll say Cities skylines can extend your creativity.
27966,"If you liked simcity, You'll like this too.  A good way to waste time if you need to."
27967,Better than Simcity with more modding options.

Great game."
27970,Highly addictive :)
27971,"10/10 has meteors, mountains, and country roads."
27972,never in my life have i had so much fun overtaxing a city
27973,"Relaxing, creative, and very enjoyable. Mod community is excellent and always providing new and enovative contributions."
27974,good
27975,is fun
27976,I'm not good at it... But i still love it
27977,"Way too addicting, hope they make a sequel!"
27978,"Honestly, I was just shocked at how awful this was. It's loaded with advertising, has like four builtin maps, and everyone hated my city for no reason that was clearly-explained to me inside the game. A lot of UI features like the placement grid did things that confused and surprised me (like, I expected that following the grid would get me... a grid? it did not, and it consistently asked me to snap to placements that left large amounts of wasted space)

I was good at most of the Sim City games and really wanted to like this, but it isn't good _at all_."
27979,"Ubuntu 20.04
CPU Intel® Core™ i5-8300H
GeForce GTX 1060 Mobile
RAM 8 Gb
Any GPU Driver

There are two options:
1. Game doesn't run at all
2. Game runs but creating new game crashes app

Sad"

27981,"This is by far the best city builder out there, I would hope there would be a way to make it look more realistic though."
27982,"I've been playing cities skylines for soo long yet it's still so addicting. Trying to create the perfect city is a never ending dream. I've gotten 20x better than I was when I started the game, yet I'm still not the master. Thanks cities skylines! Best game ever.

TL;DR: 
10/10 Base Game
10/10 DLCs"
27983,Fun game to play when you get bored of your other games.
27984,Best City Building Game Ever!
27985,"Great game, no known issues, a little hard, Overall I really like it (In the few hours I've played)."
27986,"just awesome got to try it if you like town planning and how the population can mess it up
"
27987,"1000+ plus what do you think? Most DLC can be skipped considering they're just cash grabs with little features but I at least recommend mass transit, industries, and higher education."
27988,"maybe one of the best games i have ever played in the last year, this sandbox game is extremely fun if you want to build city and love managing stuff on a large scale. you can make from the smallest villages to the biggest cities and with the wonderfull dlcs, you can do even more. the workshop access makes the experience even better, make the game your own with and don't forget to manage allt he services. 20/10, would gladly recomend to everyone i know"
27989,Its fun ending peoples lives with sewage sometimes edit: it is also fun to flood people with a size 10 tsunami and pelt with 4.5 size meteors
27990,"great game, great modding community"
27991,i want a refund
27992,This is by far the best City builder I have played over the last 20 years.  The dynamics of the game and how the supply and demand of goods and resources is great.  Very fun game and a huge modding workshop!
27993,"Cities Skylines is a great game if you like creating cities. The game gets progressively more difficult as you upgrade your small town into a metropolitan city. At first there is no traffic problem and all you have to worry about is keeping your citizens happy. Later the problems of a metropolis begin, such as traffic jams and polution. You then deal with these with better town planning and upgraded facilities. You can choose eco friendly, or fossil fuel energy and change your mind as you go along. You can follow the citizens and vehicles to get a taste of the life of a sim. Using resources available depending on your map, your goal is to create a thriving, beautiful, successful city. Overall it is a great game, with tons of support via the community with new maps and mods."
27994,Almost Heaven
27995,mate this game is AMAZING bruv
27996,"Ilość DLC totalnie niszczy tę grę. Z jednej strony koszt jest zabójczy, z drugiej mamy ogrom mechanik które niezbyt dobrze z sobą współistnieją. Campus + parki + przemysł zapewniają nieskończoność zysku przez co jedynym wyzwaniem jest minimalizacja korków. 

Wciąż jest to najlepszy symulator miasta na rynku. Zapewniła mi rozrywkę na 300 godzin, ale nie jestem w stanie polecić tej gry (nawet jeśli koszt nie ma znaczenia)"
27997,good game
27998,Build Cities then destroy them :)
27999,"phun
"
28000,"Here is my summary about this game:

Pros:
- The graphic looks good
- The immersive experience of Vanilla gameplay
- If you are looking for the detailed, fun, and addicting building game, this one for you
- Lots of mods, ranging from texture 'till additional helpful tools (included graphic mods).
- Detailed features, you can find almost everything that the biggest cities ever had irl.
- Ease access for mods since you can download it from steam workshop, and helpful community officially.

Cons:
- The game itself is quite complex, needs a quite time to learn on how to make things works out.
- Cities Skylines is not a GPU-oriented game,  it is a CPU-oriented game, so you are strongly recommended to have a strong CPU
- Takes a long time to load the city, especially if it is a huge city.
- If you decided to install mods, make sure to check the updates (or substitutes) of the mods as often as possible, especially when the update comes up
- Lots of DLCs, and each person has their own preferences, so you better check out first from any source about the DLC, and decide which DLC will suitable your city.

Overall, I recommend this game, you can just play it for fun, or go for the challenge."
28001,yes
28002,"Your all around city planning simulator, Well made and well played."
28003,"Fantastic game, the unlockables keep you playing and playing and watching your city grow from 100 to 10,000 and upwards is very rewarding. The unfortunate part is the price of the DLC's which would make the game incredible, I'm yet to get any DLC's but I know with them I'll enjoy the game even more"
28004,addictive GG
28005,I think this game is great except there is one problem the lag. there is so much lag although I do get to play the game alright. also I think the game is a bit to hard even without hard mode on because at one point my trash systems failed me. Great game but needs fixes
28006,perfect game!!!
28007,"I PLAYED 4 HOURS WORTH OF GAME PLAY AND IT CRASHED ONCE, ALL MY WORK IS GONE. THERE IS NO AUTO SAVE FEATURE AND THIS COMMENT WILL PROBABLY NOT EVEN BE TAKEN NOTE OFF. The frustration sighhhh"

28013,it's fun and so many assets to make the game so much better

28035,The best city simulator available today.
28036,"Used to love this game, however a software with a malware launcher is not acceptable. Won't touch the company's products anymore.."
28037,"[h1] More complex Simcity XD [/h1]
[spoiler] Well yes, but actually yes! [/spoiler]

It's fun game [strike] until everything breaks and you watch your city burn/collapse in a blink [/strike].
There is plenty of DLCs and workshop items so the possibilities are nearly endless!

For me 8/10 - Was really fun and challenging at the same time!

"
28038,yes
28039,"The game is the best of the type but they should update the engine, it's very outdated and makes the game feels very laggy despite the hardware resources being available. I hope they do that in the form of an update (like the guys from Euro Truck do) and not as a new game. The community is amazing, they share all kinds of great mods and assets that keep evolving to make our gaming experience better. While it says I have 400 hours or so, I actually have more than 4k hours since I played it from the time they released it but outside of steam. I hope the devs don't give up on this game, we need that engine update :)"
28040,"Best city builder on PC.

This game was soo addicting when I first played it. It was one of the few recent games in years where I actually couldn't wait to finish work to play. 

Once you have built your first metropolis though, I wasn't sure what else to do! I guess you can start again on another piece of land, but I didn't want to leave my first masterpiece city behind D:

Conclusion:
Really enjoyable game and loads of fun hours to be spent playing it learning knew things. Take it slow and learn stuff properly.

Advantages:
+Soo much content in the base game
+Really detailed and looks amazing when your city is starting to come together
+Amazing mod community
+♫ Country Roads ♫

Disadvantages:
-The garbage and funeral services will become your epitome of hate and confusion for the game
-Some good DLC add-on's should be free. Charging £100+ for all the add on's just isn't cool
-The bus and train route/stop system can be hard to use

Tip of the Review:
*Use mods! You only need to use 2 or 3, but would class them as essential. These include automatic demolishing, infinite terrain alteration and access to all 25 pieces of land(if you have a decent PC.)*

Gameplay Mechanics: 9.5/10
Story Mode: N/A
Multiplayer-Mode: N/A
Graphics: 8/10
Technical/Optimization: 9/10"
28041,lol
28042,Removed the launcher and works just fine.
28043,This is one of those rare games that could actually be called a full release game.
28044,Decent boi
28045,"A great game! You can build big, grand cities, or make people suffer. The mods are also pretty good and I like how the base game comes with some. Certainly try it out!"
28046,"If you like city builders this is like the ultimate version. Looks super good as long as you have a beefy computer, and has a bunch of stuff to explore."
28047,"I used to play sim city and thought nothing could possibly be better, well I was wrong. City skylines is one of the most amazing games I've ever played and is worth every cent. This game is truly awesome!"
28048,just a cracking game
28049,it's pretty fun.
28050,"This is  a very fun game to play, make your own city / town and have fun with it.

The Workshop makes this the best Cities game on steam. Being able to edit and create so much to the point you can mimic your own areas, or other areas, perfectly.

I'm not that good at making a city or anything, but this is really fun.

The only complaint i have is the DLCs, most of the items in them should be with the base game.

PROS:
-Extremely fun to play (if your into building)
-Able to edit and customize pretty much EVERYTHING. Allowing you to make other countries or your own cities look realistic.
-Graphics are amazing, my bad laptop can run CS.
-Theres alot more reasons that i can't explain all in one chat. This  is one, or if not, my favourite game on steam. second to Train Simulator 2021.

CONS:
-DLCs give you alot of needed and amazing items, but why have most as DLCs in the first place? Plus they can be a bit pricey at times.
-Physics arent that good. It's all fun until a hearse runs straight into the front of your building to collect the dead, while probably causing more dead in the process.

9/10, I'd recommend this game if you are into building."
28051,"Great city building game, totally worth the price :)"
28052,"Good game, way too much paid DLC. Anytime I think about getting back into it, I back away because I don't want to spend 100 USD when ON SALE to get all the DLC. The whole experience as it is should cost 50 USD. These kind of sleazy practices need to stop. Make new games or sell more copies if you want more money."
28053,"Great game, good soundtrack and easy gameplay. has a lot of elements so does not get boring easily"
28054,it is fun to play with unlimited money because its still challenging but theres less things to stress about :33
28055,Awesome game
28056,Perfect for a calm gaming experience and harder than you would expect!
28057,Its a great game that is always evolving. The developers have made a great job here. The community is very engaged into this game and there is always new content to add in the workshop.
28058,Fun and enjoyable with mods.
28059,its cool
28060,More like an open source engine than a game. Do what you wish
28061,This game is the best city game and management game that i played
28062,cool
28063,very addicting
28064,city simulator with great graphics and a huge community to expand it even more. my number one simulator game. sometimes i see it as a traffic jam simulator xD
28065,"Great game, countless opportunities. The base vanilla game lacks in variety, but all the available mods totally makes up for it!"
28066,Only downside to the game is there are nowhere near enough scenarios that come with it. There should be like 30 scenarios for more of a challenge
28067,"Exceptionally exciting gameplay. You can have lots of fun for many hours at a time thanks to the rich content that the game offers. One complaint that I do have though is the somewhat sluggish performance (low FPS) in bigger cities. Still, very nice game."
28068,I enjoy the research needed to understand what a city needs to grow and stay functional.  I've just started playing recently and seem to stall traffic at about 5000 - 10000 cims.  More research and my numbers keep growing.   I'm in my mid 60s and lost interest in playing online games with the younger players.  Glad I found this game.
28069,"It's like an idle click game with no micro transactions. You never run out of things to do.
Very easy to accidentally spend all day playing.

28071,This is one of the best Simulation based strategy and planing games right now.
28072,to many ambulances

28074,"classic, best of the best"
28075,Best city simulation game out there
28076,"This game is not very friendly to first time players. There is a huge learning curve and the tutorial gives the bare minimum. Because of how large the game was, when I looked online for a solution for my issue, it would show other things and it ended up making me more confused. Everything is very intimidating and overwhelming. For someone only dipping their toes into simulation games now, it wasn't very welcoming.
Glad that I got this on sale and that I was able to get a refund."

Every time I play I am drenched in sweat at the mere thought of what hell will go wrong. Perhaps this time my power will work for no reason? Maybe I forget to take everyone out of their fallout shelters and I can't figure out why my economy is failing? What truly will be the downfall of my mediocre city this time????"
28083,Lots of fun!
28084,"Very good game, and the game play is greatly enhanced by the various mods made by the community. Overall a great game."

Pls help😳"

28087,"- made me appreciate the beauty in the everyday design of cities
- had me researching height restriction laws at 6am"
28088,If you like SimCity You'll love this.
28089,BUILD BUILD... could gain hours of entertainment. fixing your traffic. creating your own city.. There are some bugs like services not functioning but usually can be fix by restarting the game... I dont play much city builders... and those i have I literally have forgotten already.. this one stick with me though.
28090,"Very good game, really makes the hours slip away."
28091,Very yes

28112,30/10 workshop support
28113,it is good game
28114,"It's a pretty okay city-builder, sure. 

Now look at all the DLC. 

That's all that has to be said. Don't play yourself."
28115,Best city builder game
28116,"Works out of box on Linux (ubuntu 20.10 + kernel 5.10.2 + Mesa 20.3.1) - very happy and been having lots of fun. Just wish the DLCs weren't so pricey, but workshop keeps me happy for now."
28117,city man epic
28118,Good Successor to SimCity.
28119,"bad gam cost money i go broke 
loan bad
shiti cptailsm
👎"
28120,love the fact that this game still has content creators constantly putting new things out right alongside the developer themselves sometimes same week as the new dlc
28121,"This game is truly amazing.

The simulation in itself is great, cities feel real : they behave like  I would expect a real city to behave.

The gameplay is also great : managing cities feels intuitive and fluid, even if the number of keybindings is at first intimidating.

The assets and mods available in the workshop are easy to add : just subscribe to them on Steam and turn them on in-game. Their integration to the game allows you to do so many more things but I do not believe they are necessary to the game, even though they are an essential part of the experience when you begin to dig deeper into the game.

My only regret is that so much of the content is included in DLCs which are pretty costly... 
"
28122,"I love it, and I cant wait to see a Cities Skylines 2 very soon."
28123,You make cities.
28124,Its a good city builder. Highly recommend.

28126,"I love this one. Is very realistic, and there are so many possibilities in creating the city.  It's a great experience.
I love the complexity that you can reach for the city."
28127,"Good, enjoyable. Full of possibilities and really fun. Especially with the discount to €6.99, would totally recommend."
28128,"This is a very relaxing and fun game
"
28129,Greatest city building game ever....
28130,Super fun game. Makes you want to build a real city!
28131,Fun building my own empire
28132,lousy game....  extremly slow loading.  wont load at all now when my other games load in seconds!  disapointing
28133,really fun sandbox game
28134,"It's the Simcity we had before EA made us cry, with more options and infinitely better graphics. If you like city builders, this game is king. I would recommend however, you install the mods: 1. traffic manager TM:PE and  2. Move it! They will make your life 10x easier and won't interfere will gameplay. Have fun!"
28135,Its a very good game!
28136,Good game fun to play when you are bored. It has many features and you can install great mods to make your experience better.
28137,"You can spend forever in this game!

Still spending forever in this game!

annddd still spending forever in this game!"
28138,Good.
28139,The game is very nice
28140,The game is easy to get into. it is simple to learn and then becomes complex and difficult to master at the perfect pace.
28141,nice relaxing game. ever get angry at something like csgo? then just play this! its calms you instantly and feels rewarding
28142,[b] Good Game But You Must Foucs When U Playing To Make Your City Great [/b]
28143,its cool
28144,great
28145,This game is brilliant. Use it modded and the functionality improves. It's just perfect
28146,"Was a big fan of SimCity and still love city builders, but this is stale.  And simple things that should be impossible to get wrong -- for example, connecting power lines to a power plant -- are perplexing and vexing, making learning the game a real drag."
28147,"Great city building game. Has a lot of the features from sim city, and a whole lot more. With all the dlc you could play this game for 300+ hours and still not have done everything."
28148,Fun alternative to Sim City
28149,Never really tried the game but it seems fun
28150,Great chill game to play alone.
28151,Nice game
28152,Yes.
28153,At least a billion flaws. Literally unplayable without mods. Still amazing complexity and easily the greatest city building game that exists as of yet
28154,cracking immersive game.  loving it so far
28155,"very good game graphics look like a future game it is complicated so beware of it making your head hurt


"
28156,"If you like simulation game, this one gave much fun."
28157,"Cities: Skylines is an excellent city builder with mangement. If you're into micro manging this may not be the perfect game for you however there are loads of mods and DLC's that can change the experience and give you more to do. Many might say that this game is exactly what SimCity should have been.

It can take some time to learn the core features but if you find it overwhelming just look for a tutorial on YouTube. Should be a plenty of them there.

Since this is a game published by Paradox Interactive it has a lot of DLC's that you can buy and I suggest you wait until the next sale and buy as many as you can in one package."
28158,Pretty cool
28159,Simply put this is by far my favourite city builder game and in my opinion the most fun city builder to play.
28160,A detailed city-builder with complex simulation elements.
28161,very relaxing  and  a good game
28162,just do it
28163,"cool
"
28164,nice
28165,Good but DLCs are expensive
28166,This game is great for people who like building Sims for cities and even better with youtube videos to get ahead of the features and how someone with more experience would handle growing a huge population that flows so perfectly
28167,good
28168,"Very fun to progress in, and runs well for how big the map can get. A lot of work to get traffic to flow as your city grows, but I like that part so I don't mind. Overall I recommend!"
28169,Traffic sucks irl and in game!
28170,It is the best game that I have ever played
28171,"Very fun city builder, any small issues that the game has can be fixed by mods found on the steam marketplace"
28172,Almost heaven
28173,"good game

"
28174,its very fun but sometimes i have some problems with starting up the game!
28175,"Dont buy if your on mac, it wont start."
28176,Very fun. It's very satisfying to focus on the aesthetics of the city while still providing for the basic requirements for services that the city has. There's a good balance of creativity as well as organization and managing
28177,Brilliant!!!
28178,"mint
"
28179,Look it's the best sim city like game ever!
28180,good game
28181,"Played this game for years, by far the best city builder, straight forward, but many many possibilities. Especially with mod."
28182,kys
28183,"This Game. Just AMAZING. The amount of assets and mods are Incredible, you can play this for HOURS on end and not get bored. Good Buy. Especially On sale."
28184,"With more than 250 hours in total on this game, I can tell that this is the best [b]City Building[/b] games that I ever played so far. The base game offers a ton of management features and building tools to customize your city the way you want, making something really unique and beautifully pleasent to play and watch it grow afterwards. But not less, the [b]modding community[/b] with the whole Steam workshop is what makes the game shine in it's brightest, turning the game less ""tycoon"" into more realistic and simulated for those who enjoy these kind of challenges.

If you're looking for a simple City Building, this game will probably offers what you need, but for those who seeks more challenges and highly customizable cities, the modding community will provide you the best tools for that on this game."
28185,it is a very fun game espesially if you play it with mods
28186,If you like building games with heaps of variables and the ability to design your world then this is the game for you.
28187,"Very fun City Builder game, after a few rounds it becomes very same-y for me and mods never did anything. Don't love the amount of paid DLC since I already paid for this game and don't wanna double or even triple the cost just to get everything this game has to offer. Still enjoyable however and if it starts to get boring and you have a friend that also owns the game there is a multiplayer mod that is a little bit complicated to set up but once you do it works really well."
28188,"This game seemed pretty fun, but like, once I started playing, I realized that it was just wayyy too stressful to manage- especially if u play games to relieve stress :( </3"
28189,"I'm totally addicted - this game never gets old. 

This game also forced me to upgrade to 64 GB of RAM due to how many mods I have subscribed to. It's worth it 100%. Can't get enough of this game!"
28190,i think i figured out how to install a stop light
28191,is very good. but i bought it right before the steam winter sale so i paid $30 when i could have payed $8
28192,"Cities Skylines is by far the best city building game out there right now. I've been playing it for 500h now and this is my opinion on it.
Let me start with the positive aspects of Cities Skylines.
The game is very addictive and fun without any modifications that you have to add. The Developers are constantly interacting with the community and posting new videos about user made content. It has a large variety of DLCs to chose from that add new features and options to improve your city. 
The best part of this game and the main reason that made me play it for so long is the awesome modding community that puts out new content every single day. The installation of these addons is extremely easy. You just go to the workshop, select the mod you want and click subscribe. All of these modifications are freeware.
Unlike the freeware mods that the community creates, Paradox's DLCs are mostly payware with 2 exceptions and the only thing they add is basic features that the game should have in the first place. 

I recommend Cities Skylines mostly because I adore the modding community and the different content they put out every single day. Paradox on the other hand doesn't know how to make good and useful content in form of DLCs that is worth the money."
28193,the replay need is like no other game
28194,Best city builder out right now. I may not play for a few months but i always end up coming back for more!
28195,"why is the coal power plant being robbed?
"
28196,good
28197,"This is a great city builder game. It has some awesome features, though it does try to be a few too many things at the same time. It lacks features like detailed financial breakdowns, month by month income and expenses or a way to view which public transport locations get most people onto the public transport and where they get off.
But it's still an amazing game, even if they sometimes try a few too many surface level features and don't seem to fully go the whole way on some things."
28198,"This game is very good. I have spent a lot of time on this game.

previously I got this game for free at EGS. Because the community features are more complete on Steam, and I decided to buy Steam."
28199,just buy it
28200,The Game Doesn't Run
28201,This game is everything I wanted from a city simulator.
28202,"Mindless fun, when you start playing your probably saying to yourself ''Eh that will be a bit boring'' but the more you play, the more addicted you become. _Deep_"
28203,This is the best city creation game ever
28204,"Yes, this is a good sim. There's a lot of depth to this game and you get a ton of control over the various aspects of your city. I think it's worth looking into other's games of it to decide if it's the game for you though, or to get a sense of the scale that you're actually working with. The scale can be a little deceptive as you start out with this little patch of land and limited money and options to do with it, so initial designs and plans might fail to function and need significant rework before long, but learning how to do that and plan for it in the future *is* a lot of the fun of the game. Some of the work is tedious, but rewarding when you see your city functioning, growing, happy, and making money. A good ""investment"" title."
28205,people started moving out my my city so i flooded it.
28206,Yes
28207,ONE OF MY FAVORITE GAMES!!
28208,Very good game if you want to use your imagination or to build weird stuff i guess
28209,What more could you want? endless hours of fun
28210,"I really do enjoy this game, although it has some difficulties on crappier computers like running extremely slow, the game lets you build your own perfect world. You can make anything you want with it."
28211,"No in-game tutorial on power plant placement and traffic, cities keep failing because I can't intuitvely figure out how to place a power plant so I doesn't run out of fuel.  Extremely frustrating."
28212,yes pog
28213,this might be the best city builder i have ever played just watching your city grow planing out road placing school in front of a coal powerplant is so fun building a city with 150k people and blowing it up with size 10 meteor is tons of fun the base game will keep you hooked for hours the DLC too and the mode support will gave you plenty of hour of fun building the perfect city (or just a hell hole worse than bloody detroit)
28214,"this game is great, and is perfect for people like me who love simulation games! there's so many possibilities with this game I can't even cover it in a review!"
28215,J'adore. C'est tout.
28216,"Great game, great community. Very nice. 9.5/10"
28217,crap
28218,good
28219,"Great game, 10/10"
28220,this game is very interesting
28221,"Great game to relax and talk to. Time tends to fly, but in the end ususaly you make some progress. One of those games where you just need to play to get better, there is no just being good off the bat. I wish there was multiplayer but it is still fun to share screens on discord and keep up with your friends."
28222,Way better than SimCity. Get it!!!
28223,foarte bun jocul nota 10
28224,nice game
28225,SimCity is literal doo doo water compared to this amazing city building and managing simulation.
28226,very good game
28227,Good but needs a beefy computer
28228,very good extensive hours of gameplay and fun
28229,"Very fun altho i am bad
"
28230,nice game
28231,gReAt GaMe ?1!!!!!!111!!!!!!!!!!
28232,Very Good
28233,very relaxing game for me to just chill and listen music to.
28234,เล่นเถอะครับ ลองเล่นแล้วลองจริง ไม่มีปั่น
28235,Fun city building game.
28236,"Don't get me wrong, I love Paradox, the problem is just that this game is a real cash grab. The base game itself is good but the amount of dlc and money they want for them is outrageous. I can't recommend a cash grab, I am sorry."
28237,"Very fun and immersive! There are tips,so starting with no knowledge is not a problem"
28238,"pooeoododfffggg
"
28239,Get creative outlet with tons of room for customization
28240,Great game.
28241,fun game my advice is buy all the DLCs it can be bland without them
28242,good yes get
28243,this game is so real man.. yo..
28244,hnbjg
28245,"As you can see, I only played a bit. its aight."
28246,society
28247,good
28248,Super chill and fun sim game. :)
28249,The base game is more than enough for beginning players. A great and approachable Intro to resource management games 😊
28250,gud
28251,gūd
28252,10/10
28253,This is a really good game. If only there is more updates to it. I give it a 20/10.

Comments: The vanilla game is fun for a certain amount of time but sure does get boring. The use of mods helps restore this fun and makes the game more enjoyable for a longer time period

I hope you found this review helpful! Let me your thoughts in the comments. Would be interested to hear your feedback, ideas, and what personal experiences you've had with this title."
28255,Very fun.
28256,I like it!
28257,Just an amazing game i got it yesterday for my birthday and i already have eight hours of playtime on it!
28258,"The game is unplayable without a gaming PC. Any time I run it I just have the loading screen stay for 5-6 hours or more on low end PCs. The game runs below average on anything below high end gaming PCs. Add on to the fact that 90% of the community suggests buying a gaming PC to run the game. Overall I'd suggest going for a more optimized game, instead of playing this overrated game that really needs mods to look good."
28259,Near and dear to my heart. An honest successor to the maxis sim city franchise. Forget EA.
28260,hnnng buildins
28261,"I like this game because you can kinda chill out, and build whatever you want. I recommend picking up some DLC when it goes on sale because it extend your city transport lines or add a little industrial spice. What I didn't like was the road building. I get overly invested in weird road angles, and the standard game does little to help you layout nice looking roads. Luckily there's a mod for that."
28262,"Mew~
"
28263,still crack
28264,"If you want to play the game, pay the additional 130 dollars."
28265,Followed a guy who walked all the way across the city when transit is free. 10/10.
28266,yes
28267,SimsCity Ameliorated
28268,"There is no dictionary with enough words, to describe the sheer awesomeness of this Game. There has never been a city builder, So detailed, and so utterly massive and influential since the release of this game. I do not believe there is a way to top this masterpiece. That said, there are still multiple things I wish the developers would release as expansions. 

One, a major water physics update. Cities Skylines Dynamic water, maybe the very thing that made it famous, and while texture packs exist, there is still much that could be done to improve it. 

Two, Natural Disasters. The inclusion of this brought much fun, but it still felt like there could have been more. Volcanoes for example, with lava that cools over time, or perhaps whirlpools like in Simcity 3000 Unlimited, a game that EA has not re-released last i checked. With Dynamic water, the effects would be amazing. Ice Storms, which force the city to have to thaw itself with special polocies, these things could be improved. 

Three, Man Made Disasters. Everyone knows these can happen, in real cities either from poor planning or negligence, Cities skylines is limited in this category. It would be fun if there were more types of pollution, even radiation. And have way for us to experiment in figuring out work arounds or major clean up operations. Toxic pools, or even a scenario where we are given a toxic wasteland and must make a city out of it, and clean it up. These challenges would bring a new competition to the growth of the game. 

Four. Maybe perhaps this a bad idea, you can say so below, I have no problem with it. But on a personal note, I would love to open dialog with the developers, Because this is the game I had wanted since i first played SimCity, and now, I want to ensure that all future games that expand the city building genre meet the requirements and expectations of this game. Thank You so Much Paradox Games. 

You have not ceased in my mind to Wow. 
You keep me in Awe. 
Thank you."
28269,great game that takes some learning but once you know how to play its amazing and really fun theres no city thats complete because you can always make something bedder!
28270,"Cities: Skylines is absolutely the game SimCity should have been. It gives you a sense of relaxation and is so good at being light and airy, while finding itself jam-packed with features and ways to make your city your own. Absolutely one of my favorite games and very much my favorite city builder."

28273,"If you like city building games this is it. This game has amazing city building tool, good maps that can challenge you, and the ability to buy more land after you establish your city. The only thing i'll point out is that if you like some of the goofiness of other city builders like SimCity you will be a little disappointed. Otherwise I fabulous game."
28274,SimCity wishes
28275,This is the superior successor the the other city building franchise. Well worth the investment if this sort of game is your jam.
28276,"This is a very memory expensive game, so if you have limited memory, it will run very slowly. When it is running well, it is a very interesting game, although it sometimes is not obvious why certain things happen! You install large roundabouts as you are advised to do but still manage to get massive traffic jams, even when there is an alternative route which is empty! You install bus routes to try and reduce the private traffic, then get traffic jams full of buses! And, for some unknown reason, the Mayor (you) has to demolish empty buildings when, in real life, it would be the company which buys that plot of land. All that said, I have enjoyed playing this game and would recommend it to others, but be prepared for the unknown!"
28277,very addictive and easy to just pick up and go
28278,Great city builder and traffic simulator.
28279,pretty good
28280,its worth it this game is amazing its even more fun with mods too! i love this game i hope it never dies out.
28281,3/5
28282,lol
28283,Well made city building game what to say. Worth to try and own.
28284,"best city building game currently available period with huge mod community, beautiful graphics and great vibe.

As like with any other Paradox games it has also huge dlc catalogue, which i advise to buy on sale.

"
28285,Lots of things to do. Good time waster
28286,"Fun city builder, would recommend for anyone, bit laggy though so would need a kinda beefy PC to play well. overall good!"
28287,"I see Paradox, I buy. Simple as"
28288,good game
28289,Love This Game!
28290,"Buid a city, thinking it's amazing, only to realise you done it wrong, start over.
Buid a new city and not doing the same mistakes as before, thinking it's amazing, only to realise you done it wrong, start over.
Buid a new city that will be the perfect one since you now know everything surely, thinking it's amazing, only to realise you done it wrong, start over.

This game is amazing. While your city may never be perfect to your eyes, this game pushes you to learn and to prove your creativity. Loved it"
28291,"Its my favorit management game. As a recomadation mods make this game alot better even after how good it is.
"
28292,"I used to play Sim City when I was a kid and this game is like that on steroids. A lot of fun and self pacing. Not too many bugs, just have to think ahead always next steps what to build so you aren't caught managing a crisis. Save points will help this too :)

Also there's a modding community for many things user created and a bunch of DLCs. Can get pricey but pick and choose what you want and if you like Sim City and other building games you will likely enjoy this very much."
28293,Graphics are Amazing
28294,Great and multi-faceted game!
28295,"it's good, i guess"
28296,"Great game, the best of it's kind :-)"
28297,"A very interesting game. I can see playing many hours of this. Plenty of DLC as well , which look cool. Nice."
28298,cool
28299,"Very fun and complex I would recommend this to anyone, that is devoted to their city because if your not its very easy to loose it so yes, I SUGGEST THIS GAME!!"
28300,yes
28301,"If you want to waste your time, this is the game that not only it will make your time fly fast but also make your dream virtual city make a reality with your own pace. Good stuff!"
28302,the game is interisting
28303,SHIIII B CRAYYY
28304,"Great game but I refunded it.
Thanks **** games"
28305,"A worthy successor to SimCity IV.  Dedicated devs and mod community, still fun to play after 5+ years."
28306,Good
28307,great game to destroy your pc (for heavily modded cities)
28308,"Garbage. It was garbage 5 years ago, it was garbage 8 years ago with CitiesXL:2012, it's still garbage today. Just stay clear of this hot mess."
28309,"Yes Yes Yes This game gives power to idiots who shouldn't have it and you can basically do anything. Want to fill the entire map with Poop?? DONE Want to make people become slaves to drink a Ocean DONE.
"
28310,creating a clusterfuck of a city has never been better
28311,"Very absorbing.  No limit to gameplay, just keep on building!"
28312,What simcity should be.
28313,"Great Game., You can build giantic cites"
28314,buildings are phallic i love it
28315,Epik Always Dream of having this game
28316,"Honestly a great game, soothes my anxiety lol."
28317,the best city builder
28318,city game go brrr
28319,+
28320,yes
28321,Ultimate city builder.  It keeps you coming back again and again.  New content and creators keep the game fresh.  Love it!
28322,"[b] Cities Skylines is in my opinion the best city simulator. You can do what you want. :D [/b]

[b] Disadvantages: [/b]

❌ Poor optimization (Lots of buildings, lots of lags)
❌ Rare updates (creators are focused on DLCs)
❌ Expensive big DLCs. (They cost as much as game)

[b] Advantages: [/b]

✔️ Good building mechanics.
✔️ In the game you can name every single human, vehicle, building.
✔️ You can build lots of towns on single world.
✔️ Lots of comunity modifications on workshop, that improve the game.
✔️ Often discounts on game and DLCs
✔️ Beautiful graphics.

[b] Game is good, but not perfect. Better than Simcity and other city simulators C: [/b]"
28323,It has mods
28324,like the game !
28325,fun
28326,G.O.A.T
28327,Best city building game there is.
28328,this is a great game would recomed but it is a little challenge
28329,"good timewaster, and if you wanna have fun, DO NOT play the one without unlimited money. it. is. horror. i've played for only 4 hours and i've already failed to even get down a half-assed industrial district in my city bruh"
28330,COOL
28331,great
28332,A full Featured and Good looking city builder. However you will get bored unless you are willing for fork over cash for the expansions
28333,Love it!
28334,fun
28335,"While I have a few negatives, the game is really great.
Pros:
I) It's just plain fun. I like to see my cities grow from little hamlets to big cities with over 75k people.
II) I can be creative. There are so many mods and so many roads and style of playing and it is so cool.
III) It's (somewhat) realistic with the base game. In vanilla (no mods), the graphics look amazing, especially for an indie game. Bravo paradox!
IV) New patches. This game has been patched and fixed and it makes the game less buggy in general.
V) The price is cheap. With one steam card ($20), you can purchase this game, which makes it cheap for what it allows you to do. (P.S. this game is 1/3 the price of SimCity 2013(?).)

Cons:
I) It makes my PC lag a little. I have a pretty mid ranged computer with no graphics card, and It runs okay. It gets choppy though, and I have to turn the graphics down.
II) DLC. There are a lot of features locked behind DLC, but its still worth it. (Pro/Con. Depens on how you see this.)

Overall, this gets 4.5/5. I just need a graphics card and some money, and then its a 5/5
Graphics (no mods): 4/5
Gameplay: 5/5
Performance: 3/5
UI: 4.5/5
Difficulty: Easy"
28336,Well designed and paced city building that has enough complex mechanics to keep things interesting without being too overwhelming for the most part.
28337,"Yes, Fun, good modding community"
28338,hi
28339,good game 10/9
28340,city epic
28341,"It's fun, even though i suck at it"
28342,"Lots of learning curves to get really good at it but all in all its a great game! Mods are fun, and very helpful, or can be once you figure out how they work. Most are pretty easy and very self explanatory, some not so much but you'll find that in most modded games. I would say from my first couple of hours, I still don't really have the hang of things yet but there's a lot to learn. All I know is I am having a great time and learning little bits as I go.

So to kind of give more context to my words, I'll explain a bit. I'm not a city builder at all. It isn't really in my realm of games but is partially. I like sandbox type stuff and this fits that but the management isn't really my thing. Budgets and I don't really get along. lol I mean if my real life teaches us anything, my money management skills are somewhat lacking... Ok so they just don't exist at all but I get by. What can you do? Anyway I'm kinda learning... a little. I still run out of money and can't make my city last more than a few thousand pop before I sink it and have no clue what I did or possibly didn't do. IDK! Still I am having fun learning and playing and burning shit to the ground!
"
28343,"nice game
"
28344,Overwelmingly great
28345,"not bad, not bad"
28346,Base game is pretty good. The DLC isn't worth it imo because it just isn't. Workshop support is nice tho.
28347,"Great game, good mods"
28348,"Fun, realistic game. Not hard to learn how to play."
28349,Super
28350,"It's basically Sim City but better and more layered. It has a fairly tricky learning curve but once you get used to the day to day running of the city and juggling budgets to meet resource demand, you'll be flying."
28351,"I love the game, It is like simcity, but gets more in depth."
28352,fun
28353,If you think your time is worth something then don't buy this game...
28354,it's good
28355,"very nice game, lots of heart for a sandbox"
28356,It's fun if you like it
28357,Steam version is bugged af. Crashes if discord is running or if you try to save.
28358,"Great game, love the detail of just building and helping your citizens. Good game to people who want to start off  with simulators!"
28359,"10/10
traffic management simulator 
loads of cool workshop content
can easily forget what time it is"
28360,"Yes. Yes I would recommend. Even the base game at launch in 2015 was amazing. There's a lot of criticism about the dlc, but you don't need it to have a good time. There's still space for the genre to improve but honestly this remains the best city builder I've ever played."
28361,I WANT TO HAVE FUN
28362,luv ths
28363,very addictive - playing a lot
28364,"Amazing game, IF you have right Steam Workshop mods and maybe (somewhat seems like:) over priced DLCs. I mean, it's fun game playing around, but you kinda need to spend more time / money to be BENEFICIAL from it. DEFINITELY recommend you buying it while the sale lasts. + Buy DLCs as well whenever it's on sale.

Edit: Workshop Mods are amazing"
28365,GOOD

28370,Great game coming from an old school Sim Cities fan!
28371,It's a great and entertaining game with a great Steam Workshop community!
28372,"Liked Sim City, well then, prepare to kiss your social life good-bye with this game purchase!"
28373,Very addictive.
28374,"Solid city builder, plenty of freedom. Seamless mod support really helps you build the city skyline of your dreams. Unfortunately this game participates in mixed-use zoning erasure, for that I give it a big 0/10."
28375,"Best city building sim out there. And this game is what, 5 years old now? Its still the GOAT. And ive played ALOT of simcity in my day."
28376,i spent 4 hours on a city for tit just to die cause i made one change to the city. one change
28377,Yes I would highly recommend this game to anyone that wants a challenge and would like to learn new skills. This game is quite amazing and very addictive.
28378,s
28379,"I have absolutely no experience in city building. In fact, I would say this game teaches you to learn how to become a city builder designer. I have had to watch several videos on how to properly play this game and make a city run like it should. I am still no expert nor anywhere close to understanding much but this gives me a good look at what city design is like. I highly recommend this for anyone who wants a challenge. The developers of the game promotes to the community a lot to design their own assets and mods which is incredible. Try the game out for the challenge and try it out if you know a lot about designing a city! Maybe you might learn a thing or two."
28380,Amazing Game
28381,"Looks good, plays good, and its as deep or shallow as you want it to be. 

Death waves suck though."
28382,"Building roads while trying to deal with traffic problems is ass.

8/10"
28383,"Pros:
-Everything you loved about Sim City before EA took a big shit on it
-Fantastic mod support
-Extremely active and positive player community

Cons:
-All of your citizens use twitter"
28384,"Like building ? 
Like wasting away hours of your life building a city only to want to restart and build another
ez buy"
28385,Better than any other city builder I have played. Tons of Content.
28386,big chungus city hahahhhhhhhhhhhhhh
28387,"modern version of sim city, chill relaxed game to play, recommend to play it with mods tho"
28388,"I can not play this game, as i keep on getting phoned by an English boy asking if i'm playing this game."
28389,worth it
28390,"i love spending $25 on dlc that just does nothing and ruins my city if i use it, i would 100% recommend this money stealing half decent paradox game, that will make you have to plunge yourself into debt to pay for, and usually is fucking broken, i also love how whenever they add a new dlc it basically corrupts your city files so you lose of hours of work and a good standing at your local bank. i just love how so much of the game isnt optimised so when i have a 10000 population city my decent computer that should handle it runs at a kardashian level (shit), so yeah i would recommend another game paradox has ruined by making what should be free updates/content its own dlc that costs as much as a doom"
28391,Very relaxing game
28392,good game
28393,"This Sim City-esque municipal management simulator is the right level of detailed, but not too detailed. Its not perfect, but I've enjoyed many hours building my machine and rebuilding it better. Lots of mod support from the workshop and some in game 'cheats' for when I'm feeling like playing in the sandbox more than succeeding at the challenge. Good stuff, good dlc content, good fun."
28394,adsasffjgk/
28395,DESTUCTION >:)
28396,"With a budget, it's not that fun, but with mods, it's amazing"
28397,"I have more hours into this than any other Steam game. I'm an engineer at heart and so for me (and many others, I think) Cities: Skylines is basically Traffic Simulator: The Game. It does a decent job at simulating real-life traffic situations, behavior, and problems. I'd hope some of the game limits would be solved in a CS2, but for now I'm very happy with the nearly 400 hours I've sunk into it. It scratches an itch I didn't realize I had. So all Traffic Engineer wannabees out there -- buy it. Buy Mass Transit and Industries and get TM:PE from the Workshop."
28398,cool
28399,city
28400,"I like how i can progress in this game and its never really over
"
28401,"I'm sure I'm not the first to say this, but this is what SimCity 5 should have been. Unparalleled city builder with 'realistic' traffic simulation. Traffic Manager, Road-anarchy and MoveIt mods are essential to a satisfying gameplay and should definitely be included in the original game, so don't forget to add them."
28402,Everyone is my city is dead!
28403,It's a paradox game so you know they excluded content to put in DLC's. They also recently added a launcher that literally nobody wanted that just collects data. The traffic system is also fucking broken. I only recommend buying it if it's on sale.
28404,"For one thing the crashing of the game. Everything thing else i like. would like to see other players being able to come and see your city, like in simcity."
28405,Nothing Less Than Game of The Decade!
28406,Great city builder
28407,"300~ hours in, so i think i should review this.
traffic is broken, industry is broken, basically this is a 'beta' quality game.
its fun in its own way, but i couldn't in my right mind encourage people to buy this."
28408,Amazing game!!
28409,it good
28410,watched hours of peeps building cities on youtube and now i'm one of them finally.
28411,cool
28412,"Once you get the hang of the controls, maybe with the help of some mods, the game is very addictive and the graphics are still stunning"
28413,Best city-builder ever.. plan a lot of free time for the game
28414,All industrial city
28415,Amazing game!
28416,"make town, blow up town, its not terrorism if ur blowing up your own property, its an insurance scam"
28417,Fairly Swag  4/5
28418,It's a perfect city-builder.
28419,it good
28420,"The most realistic and relaxing city building simulator out there. Absolutely spectacular. My only issue is there is a lot of DLC and I can't seem to find a season pass. However, the DLC is so great and the game doesn't feel incomplete without it, so I can forgive it. If you ever find this on sale, buy it. Even if it isn't, it's well worth the full price. If you want DLC, I recommend Mass Transit and Green Cities, as they are the most useful and most mods on the workshop require those. The rest is up to preference."
28421,"Very fun game but crashes way Way to much, with or without mods, crashes at least twice a day for me, it will crash about every hour or two, if your lucky you might get 2 or more hours in before a crash,/  high end pc with 32gb memory.

I still like the game and i just came to look at any new DLC.

"
28422,Love it
28423,Awesome game! but please make CS2 that's updated graphics
28424,"The level of detail in this game is fantastic. It could do with a more guided / easily followed tutorial, but it's somewhat intuitive and you get the hang of it soon enough.

This is what companies like EA could be aiming for with games like SimCity: Skylines is basically the city game to end all city games, because once you get into this, it's not very likely that you'll prefer any other city game over it.

It does have certain bits where it leaves something to be desired, but it's still very well made and the sound design & OST are really fun."
28425,Technically the best city building game there is indeed.
28426,"It's a bit tricky to get ahold of at first, but once you do it's really enjoyable. The trick is to not grow too fast, so that you don't get overrun by costs. 

The music, and the atmosphere it creates, are really lovely and it's a great game to play if you need to spend some time relaxing. The makers' attention to detail is also incredible; each individual building, pedestrian and car comes with its own story, and everything is really wonderfully integrated.

Would highly recommend, with the warning that you may hate it at first (like I did) and that a little bit of finessing is required to get to a point in the game where you can play in a fairly relaxed way and just watch your city grow."
28427,good game if you dont mind the price of the dlcs
28428,"This game is great. You need a couple mods to really make it playable, but it's not a huge deal, and if you wanna get deep into modding, the sky really is the limit. Plus, it runs on Linux"
28429,"Great CIty builder,"
28430,"Wow, it for some reason took me quite a long time to even write a review for this game, but jeez this game is worth the money. I will try to keep the review short as there is so much to cover.

Cons:

Slightly overpriced DLCs.

Lack of some features which should be in the game which mods have to provide.

Pros:

Great graphics. If you don't like the colour corrections, you can get a colour correction mod from the workshop and almost completely change the game appearance to your preference. 

Game individually records every citizen, vehicle, even every single piece of grass. How many people are on that vehicle, whether they are tourists, educated and where they work.

Very rich variety of mods and assets on the Steam Workshop.

So much possibility of micromanagment of your city down to the individual road segments. Even down to the individual lines on the road with mods.

A seriously good game, way to addictive, you can even spend an entire day on a single road getting it to how you want it to look. The game is flexible, if you're less patient, you can do so without affecting the experience too drastically, however that may have an effect on the appearance of your city. If you are more patient, then you can basically do whatever you want. This game is also good for relieving your stress and relaxing."
28431,"Excellent traffic simulator, destroys my eyes and relationships"
28432,"I love it! Best city builder out there. Only thing... the DLCs are very expensive
"
28433,Best City builder.

28438,you build cities
28439,"5 stars , amazing game"
28440,Good fun!
28441,Its fun and gets you looking at the good things in your city but more fun with mods
28442,.
28443,A great game with active devs and an abundance of content.
28444,This game is very fun but this game take a lot of ram space.

28453,"Very relaxing. easy to learn the basics, a surprising amount of depth"
28454,"This is one of my favorite games. I was a huge Simcity 4 player when that came out and at first felt hesitant to try this game. But then I got hooked and it's so much fun building a city. Mods really open this up and help make the city look less fake. 

I thought there wouldn't be a game that would make me stop playing Simcity 4, but this did it. It added mechanics that Simcity 4 could only ever dream of."
28455,Yes
28456,It's way better than SimCity.
28457,sr g
28458,"best game ever
"
28459,Allows for the creation and destruction of cities. How much more could you ask for? Although the car AI is a bit stupid as they change lanes using 90 degree turns instead of smooth transitions.
28460,"I used to love SimCity before that game was destroyed by EA....so I've stayed away from city builders for a long time. I've had an eye on this game for awhile, but never pulled the trigger......til now.......It's shame I waited as long as I did, but the wait I think was worth it because I really do enjoy this game and has really stepped up the city builder genre."
28461,DO IT!
28462,its good for creative and smart people!
28463,worshipable
28464,"after 1000 hours i fallen in love with the game , really was able to flex my creative side 10/10"

28468,"There are so many things to consider but this is loads of fun, I have watched countless You tube videos CS but I still with there was a better way to teach laying down roads, I built a bunch and the bull dozed them over and over and still find building roads one of my pet peeves with CS but I still love it!"

28475,It’s a great game. Very immersive with an active community. I would like to see the dev team develop this game further rather than come out with a brand new version. So many have invested so much time and money into Cities Skylines that it seems silly to start all over.
28476,"
👍"
28477,"Good game, but it shills pretty hard for its massive amount of DLC.  
My advice: Get it all in a bundle during a steam sale for the full experience.
Also you need a pretty serious rig to play it once your city gets going."
28478,This is a great builder game and keeps the imagination flowing. My biggest challenge so far is in trying to keep my traffic flowing at 70% or higher. Most times I'm at 30 to 50%. While the learning curve can be a little steep it is still a fantastic game and I would recommend it to anyone. You will not be disappointed and will find yourself getting lost in many wonderful hours of game time.
28479,very nice
28480,"The base game is great by itself.
Easy learning curve.
Bug free.
Great mod options.
Researching and choosing DLC as you want is a great option.
All That Jazz radio is great!"
28481,"Great game, looks great. Perfect for some nice relaxing fun."
28482,It's fun
28483,Great simulation game! If you have a machine that can handle more than the vanilla game- def utilize the workshop mods. If you do not have a power machine- keep it vanilla with a traffic mod activated to give it that extra push without burning up your processor.
28484,Best city builder in years!

28488,Much better than any other city build games. But too many expansion packs. Maybe there should be reduced number.
28489,"good
"
28490,"Very interesting  and entertaining even in the vanilla version of the game. Since this  is my first game using mods and assets, I find those additions someone difficult for me at this time. Overall this exceeded my expectations and would highly recommend it to anyone interested in this type of gaming. The videos posted by other players are also a great asset to this game."
28491,"You get back what you put into it.  The base game is amazing, and when you add mods and extras, you really start to see the full potential.  LOVE 1000%"
28492,Near perfect execution of a city builder for the current generation
28493,Good game
28494,"Best City builder ever.  Amazing mod community.  If you like city building, this is a must play."
28495,Great game with a lot of add-ons!
28496,Good game especially with mods and assets :)
28497,Pretty good. Especially with mods
28498,10/10 i can cause mass genocide
28499,feel smart
28500,"Undoubtedly it is a good game if you would like to build a realistic city. But the key point is that, it is really fun to make something fun in city skyline, especially with the help of mods. For instance, I can make a roller coaster-like railway, or make a hospital on a hill which is only connected with pedestrian roads. I really enjoy doing such ""experiments"" in city skyline :)"
28501,Casually draining the oceans for more land
28502,"By far the most in-depth and detailed city building simulator that I've played. It always keeps you on your toes and makes you think about planning areas as opposed to simply placing buildings and hoping for the best. I particularly enjoyed seeing the impacts of the city on the surrounding landscape, and trying to minimise these impacts while expanding the city. Would definitely very highly recommend this game to anyone who's thinking of trying it."
28503,Simply the best City-Builder.
28504,Poop Volcano
28505,Its a super ok game if you are a creative man and like expresing that creativity
28506,"The hands down best city simulator game on the market. You won't be disappointed, even on console, or mac!"
28507,good
28508,"Overall beautiful game. Robust customization options, combined with fantastic graphics makes this game very captivating and addicting. Even in 2021 this 6 year-old game looks wonderful. Only thing I don't care for is the garbage truck spawns, there are so many and they really make up a majority of traffic on the roads. The lack of multiplayer is also disappointing and would really boost this games sales if was included. 9/10"
28509,"This game is great for all kinds of people. Those who want neat disciplined and arranged lines or curly artistic flair or a mixture of both.

Warning: Player may be intensely triggered when trying to join city sections together and realise there was a half square somewhere in the middle.

Otherwise! Its a fun game! Build a city, find it doesnt work.... slowly regress into making grids and... still fail... and watch a video where they do amazing beautiful cities... enter the rabbit hole of mods. still fail at making beautiful working cities, but at least you have more tools to fail with =)

Failures promote growth!!"
28510,Love that you can mod this game without this the game would be stale at this point. Game can get addicting for a perfectionist like myself which can eat up hours out of my day but it's totally worth it if you want to kick back and relax and not have to worry about complexity of game play. It is a pretty easy game to learn and understand. Would recommend to anyone who likes city building and simulation game play.
28511,good
28512,Addicting
28513,"if you love City Builders, this will be your new home! ;D"
28514,poop lake i make fun
28515,ALL OF IT
28516,"Cities Skylines is easily the best city builder game ever made. It's not super overwhelming to start but the amount of content and gameplay is almost endless with the DLCs and modding community. You can as involved in your city as you like, to zoning entire neighborhoods in one click to manually setting the stop lights for each intersection. I highly recommend this game :)"
28517,i might be gay
28518,its fine
28519,"Ok, Steam Summer Sale came about and i got most of the *main* DLC for like $30, so now that this game has actual content, its not bad, and for the love of god, do NOT buy the DLC outside of a sale, for 15-30 dollars a piece, its not worth it, but for 4-10 a piece, it is"

28528,"Best Modern Day based City builder there is. The SimCity version is long dead in my eyes. This isn't perfect but it gets close. The only draw back are the low frame rates at the lat stages of the game when you have a lot of Cims moving around your city. But after 450 hours played I can recommend this game easy. Just make sure to have at least 16GB of memory if you plan of running the game late stage, and even then expect low FPS."
28529,Best city game ever made. Great upgrades in the latest DLC's with HUGE buildings. Love this game.
28530,Banger
28531,Chill city-builder.
28532,"If you like city builders, then Cities: Skylines is a fantastic one to dive into. The controls are easy enough to learn, but there is a bit of a learning curve for understanding good city management. The mods in the workshop are fantastic, and the community is really awesome. The base game is really affordable, and you don't need the DLC to have a good time (though, with how much you get out of each one, it's hard to say no!)"
28533,It's a great game!
28534,Pretty much the perfect City Sim
28535,"good game
"
28536,"Much better than Sim City. When I downloaded Sim City, I got bored playing it because I wasn't free to do the things I want. Cities Skylines, in my opinion, is more like Sim City than Sim City  itself. Cities Skylines is a great game to play and I don't get bored as often."
28537,communism
28538,Best City building game ever
28539,yes
28540,I enjoy the city simulation. I find it relaxing and easy to get lost in.

28542,One of the best games I've ever played. It's so simple on the surface but can become so complex so quickly there is always something new to try.

28544,i forgive the city im living in now for its traffic :)
28545,"Really like this game how you can create or recreate almost an entire city!
There are many DLCs out there unfortnatly those are paid and kinda expensive but there are some free ones.
Glad there is a workshop but be aware it might crash or brick your game and also pay attencion it will block you from getting achivements.

It will be a little frustating at the start you will run out of money easly if you build to many houses and roads, you would want to invest first on power and water delivery, for sure you dont want to go backrupt on the first 10 minutes of gameplay ahah.

Lovely graphics, nice atmospher, many ways to create.

9/10"
28546,gud
28547,I don't have many hours on this game but it is the best city management game ever made. You can control pretty much every aspect of your city (especially with all useful DLC).

28560,"This is an amazing way to pass time if you just want to relax and create something, the simple gameplay once you get a hold of it is good for long periods of time, being simple enough to manipulate in complicated ways when you start experimenting with it (not even including any of the workshop content), in addition to this the scenery is smooth and the ambiance is calming enough to retain your attention for long periods of time, sadly there is not much on the end of graphics settings for low end computers and even using extra workshop content to improve the frame rate was difficult, although even if you have a potato it is an overall good experience.  7/10"
28561,i like
28562,It's the best city builder. Wanna chill and build a city? Play this game. Wanna micromanage a city? Play this game.
28563,"For fans of Sim City, this is a nice graphic upgrade! It's a bit of a steep learning curve at first, though the tutorial game is helpful. Mac controls seem a bit awkward, but it is still playable."
28564,creack
28565,Funnest game ever I can be on it for hours!
28566,"It's a good city building game, a lot of customization with assets. The game needs a decent computer to run and a beefy computer to run well. Once population of your city gets higher, your computer power will be tested."
28567,"Word of advice to anybody still considering buying this game. There are 2 ways to go, either you're addicted and you, like me, would put in almost 160 hours into playing since March 2020, or you don't play at all."
28568,"Cities skylines is a good game, but only because it's the only one of its kind. The mods are what make it great, but at its core, it's become a simple cash grab from paradox. Great game, bad company"
28569,"Steam has given me a prompt asking if I would recommend this game to others.
Yea, it's a good game. If I were an aspiring video game developer for a city builder I might start with this, SimCity 4, throw in Banished, a tavern game (if anyone ever makes a good tavern game), Terraria, and Sims 4 for good inspiration."
28570,"A lot of fun to play, you may want to install mods though, it can get quite boring otherwise."
28571,Awesome
28572,Cities is the best city sim game on the market today. But Traffic sucks just like real life
28573,Game is good
28574,
28575,Addicting and fun.
28576,"Truly a masterpiece and a milestone for the 2010's in terms of City Building, however I do personally feel as if it is time for a new Cities:Skylines, the game begins to feel old after a while and doing the same thing over and over with its slowly degrading graphics.

Overall I give this game a big 9/10.

The only point deducing the game from a 10/10 is the base does not have as much content making you pay for DLC.

9/10."
28577,"The most realistic city building game I have ever played. It's limitless, and the option to have unlimited money is perfect. The only downside I see to this game is that you need to be creative. If you're not creative in the slightest bit then you're going to have a tough time making decisions."
28578,0/10 Can't recreate municipal border gore
28579,It's a very relaxing game and I love it
28580,I can't believe I wasted so much time in SimCity. This is way better!
28581,"Great game! but I wish the DLCs were cheaper $15 for natural disasters wow.
have the wiki open when playing this lol."
28582,I used to play simcity and this just blows my mind
28583,if you really gonna make your game for free on epic store atleast give some thing to the people who bought it on steam
28584,good if you have the willingness to watch something youve worked on for tens of hours die out. its a great game otherwise.
28585,nice
28586,To those of you who plan to get this game and not kill the entire city with a raw sewage flood at some point: your degeneracy will not go unpunished
28587,yes
28588,Many hours can be lost playing this game....  it's particularly compelling to organise the traffic efficiency
28589,very epic. i build city yes hmmm fun
28590,"ja is echt wel leuk enzo met dat bouwen.

28591,The only game I regularly revisit
28592,great game not so many options without dlcs recommend using scenarios after awhile to not lose interest
28593,it's addicitive likepxrn
28594,fun af
28595,Very good game Traffic sucks but verry good russia man give VODKA/10
28596,"A good city builder that covers a lot of the things in a real city, you going to need a good CPU"
28597,This is the most resourceful city planning/builder game out there with advanced mechanics and a large community for your year long fun
28598,its fun when all your citizens abandon you
28599,I have City Skylines and been using it for a few months but just recently the game keeps crashing at start up. I have tried every configuration but to no avail. I can honestly not recommend  this game. I don't know if it is my new computer ( it is more powerful than my last) but it will not work. I do have other games I use on steam and they work perfectly. I can't honestly say what the problem is but City Skylines did work fine on my new p.c until a few days ago.  I am trying to seek help with this problem but so far nothing has worked.
28600,"It is a good game, a few can deny that based on different topics but overall best city building game out there but there are a few issues. The worst is, it being a Paradox game. We know Paradox can make pretty solid games but man how many DLC's are enough? Unfortunetaly this game suffers the same fate and base game could be considered naked without at least some DLC's"

28604,ye
28605,very fun
28606,its a super good game
28607,"Cities: Skylines definitely deserve it's reputation as a City Builder game that has prevailing through the challenge of time. It's pretty neat and solid, it's good choice to grab when you are looking for a game and it's genre, more so it's often on sale on Steam. Awaiting for future DLC, preferably if there are one that will give futuristic building theme."
28608,
28609,"I like it because it is really a detailed game, and complex graphics :)"

28614,it's best when it's on sale
28615,Best city sim available!
28616,"THE BEST CITY BUILDER GAME EVER
I am not talking about the DLCs.
Free mods and thousands of assets in steam workshop are making this game infinite options to create your city of dreams.
That's the main reason I love it.

P.S.: SimCity sucks."
28617,this game is suitable for students that wants to persue their career into city planning as this provides multiple challanges and realistic problems such as healthcare and etc.Most importantly there are other ways to be creative and create beatiful cities while manangin it

28625,"Xity Skylines is NOT FREE! If an individual name of Epic Game calls you on your on line email, you DO NOT answer him. In 2015, I lost $60,000 to online scammers, usually from INDIA. Ever since the Brits let go of India, it has become an absolute HELLHOLE now they have all my MONEY. If you want to keep your DOLLARS USD then DO NOT respond to Epic Games Store BECAUSE they do not have FREE games. If they were FREE? How would EPIC make MONEY ? They are a company, not a bloody SHOW BUSINESS. They don't give FREE BLOWJOBS. Back in my day, the Indians were proper British folk, who drank tea and illegally smuggled opium into China. Now? They are CRIMINALS. GIVE ME BACK MY 60 THOUSAND DOLLARS I WAS SUPPOSED TO SEND MY CHILDREN TO COLLEGE NOW MY LITTLE BOY JAMES GARFIELD IS LIVING IN PARAGUAY ON AN INTERNATIONAL SCHOLARSHIP AND WHEN HE COMES BACK HE WILL BE OPPRESSED BY JOSEPH (STALIN) BIDEN OF THE HARRIS/BIDEN PRESIDENCY CAMPAIGN. Overall I'd recommend this game."

28638,i like everything good game
28639,Very addicting game
28640,Best simulation game out there
28641,"I played this game on a different system a couple of years ago. The vanilla version of the game is basically just a  traffic simulator (not a smart one, as cars in a 3-lane road will still queue in the same lane, creating huge traffic jams!). There are about 28 DLC... I haven't used the DLCs, so I can't tell if they're good or not, but I certainly remember the time when city builders came with the various industries, universities and mass transit all included in the base game! 
My advice: wait until super-discounted, or when all the DLC and the base game will be published as a bundle at an acceptable price."
28642,"Fun and has some options, but unfortunately relies on DLC for content additions. This game isn't for everyone but if you like city building games it's worth a buy on sale (or for free on Epic Games right now...)"
28643,"Great game but if you're broke currently do head over to the Epic games store it's free as of 12/17 until 12/18 so go grab it while you can :D

https://www.epicgames.com/store/en-US/product/cities-skylines/home"
28644,Good game
28645,"The vanilla game is an incredible city builder, and when you add some of the DLC and user-created mods, it makes it fantastic. I highly recommend it to anyone interested in city builders."
28646,Love all of it
28647,Completely engaging and great AI. Quite fun!
28648,its good

28654,Really detailed city builder which goes head over heels above the likes of SimCity with it's detail. Awesome graphics too.
28655,"So addictive, very fun, run a bit low in fps when you have a lot of mods and big cities. 

And the best part, the workshop is enormous."
28656,sou prefeita de uma cidade na vida real
28657,"Bad EULA, DLCs are a complete rip-off, gameplay is boring after only a few hours. Very disappointed. Do not buy into this series unless all the DLCs are less than five dollars and they stop collecting user data. They obviously don't use the data anyways since the game has a lousy road-building system riddled with bugs and the map-building is unnecessarily difficult to use.

 Although I would like to let it be known that I find the radio-commercials to be spectacular, hilarious, and worth a quick tip of the hat, well done."
28658,The best City Builder.
28659,This simulation make me like mayor haha

28661,"SIM CITIES, legit :P
"
28662,"Super fun game. Like most things, it's easy to learn, yet challenging to master.  Various DLC's expand aspects of the game.  Overall, best city simulator I have played."
28663,Enjoyable city builder.  I get lost for hours in it.
28664,"If you are frustrated with your gov't IRL, this game would gonna be an alternative reality of your home/fav place as per your own limitless imagination."

28670,Excellent city building and management game. Well worth the money and time.
28671,this is a game

28680,I like resource management/sim games so this was a no-brainer for me!
28681,Cities: Skylines is Sim City 5 in my heart. I hope its in yours too.
28682,peaceful city builder
28683,"The instant someone says about city building games i think city skylines
Graphics are good
Gameplay is mostly fun (if you don't stress too much trying to fix traffic)
Most DLCs are worth it, some aren't 
Mods and maps on the workshop are interesting (although you can't get achivements out of modded worlds)

28684,better than simcity
28685,Why organize your room to get rid of your depression and make yourself more efficient when you can organize your city's road layout to get rid of your citizen's depression and make the city more efficient?
28686,This is the best game I have! It's like an ant farm but with tiny humans!
28687,"This game is for a very specific type of person. It isn't for the person who likes guns, chicks, and explosions. This game is recline, put together, and watch. Personally it isn't for me because a lot of it is the same thing, fulfill the needs of the citizens, expand, try not to get everything blown up or flooded with sewage. But if you're the very specific type of person that enjoys feeling like a leader of some sort and are willing to spend a lot of time satisfying bits of code, this is for you. I suggest waiting for a sale, Christmas is soon and the value is of course a lot better during a sale."

28694,Very cool!
28695,"Very fun, runs fairly well."
28696,I was heartbroken when I thought the game stopped working on my computer. Worth the purchase.
28697,"When the SimCity franchise was discontinued, I was really disappointed so I got this game as a potential successor. Having a lot of space to build your city is really fun, also there are tons of mods to improve the gameplay. If you are into public transport and traffic, this game is perfect for you, since you can plan routes and combine multiple types of transport.

However, when you have a bad CPU you can't build a massive city since the game will start to lag. Another problem is getting rid of trash and dead persons, this never seemed to work for me even though I built tons of facilities for that (which I solved by basically cheating and installing a mod which resolves this problem)."
28698,i love this game
28699,"I've played for 200+ hours and this game is one of the best games I've ever played. 11/10, would recommend. :D"
28700,More fun than I thought it would be. All that DLC adds up though.
28701,Very hard and not for beginners but worth it just for the planning. Definitely don't turn on environmental hazards when you're new though >-<
28702,So Fun...You can build your city anyway you want!  You even can put train tracks anywhere in the city etc...A Must Buy game!!
28703,Good game. Launchers are bad. Stop it. Pls.
28704,good.

28709,Hell. Yes
28710,"10/10
Fun game to just chill out to.
If you are worried about micro-management and everything becoming over-complicated, just chuck it into sandbox mode and have fun building your dream city. One of the best workshop communities on steam, new assets and mods coming out everyday on the workshop. There is no real need to buy the DLC, unless you feel like it will add to your city building experience."
28711,
28712,Chill and fun
28713,"pp

28714,"I played few games before and gave up... I made so many mistakes that I just decided to give up. But years later ( today ), I give it another try. But today, I tried to understand the logic and strategy for everything that needed to be done respectively and with ""common sense"". Ex:  My farming and forestry industries was always empty. Not enough workers. Never understood why. Now I know why.. everyone was ""too educated"" which left no one left to work in my farms and forestry industries. Same thing with roads, tax, budget. I never understood how to manage those. Now I do. And now, I make tons of money, less traffic, and my people love me so much that they want to vote me again as Next Mayor. Cheers."

28724,"Finally a city-building game where you can play by the rules, but don't have to, and can keep it vanilla, but don't have to. I believe there hasn't been so much excitement in the community since the first SimCity. The fact that Cities: Skylines is still going strong after many years shows how much a great design counts towards its longevity. Has been a great pastime especially through the pandemic.

Please keep the development going!"

28736,"I'm sorry. I know there are many people that likes this game, but every time I try it, it ends with a rage quit.

A few of the things I'm noticing:
- It's very easy to buldoze the wrong thing, and sometimes you don't even have the tool to restore what you've done because you have not reached the right level. I know I can enable everything up front, but what's then the meaning of building from the ground up. CTRL-Z anyone?
- Sometimes you just can't build what you want to even though you've done it before. The most common example is parallel one way roads. Funny thing is that you can have a set of them on the map, but when you want to extend them they start to diverge.
The list goes on.

You would think that a game from 2016 should have reached some kind of maturity level."

28748,"It's basically SimCity. While I wish there wasn't so much tucked behind the DLC wall, there is still a lot of fun to be had with the vanilla base game. The sound design and graphic style suite this title nicely. It is a slow-paced game that is fun, though every play through will feel very similar and progress the same way. So it does lack a little bit of variety between each new start. If you are a fan of city building and economy management games like SimCity, this will be right up your ally. If you don't like that genre of games, then don't feel obligated to play this one.

Overall: 3/5"

28751,fun
28752,Great game
28753,"The focus on roads and traffic management make managing your city a little difficult for those of us who aren't the greatest at urban planning, but this is a gorgeous, fun, mostly sandbox game.

I'd love for there to be more of a focus on goals/upgrades/progression, but for a chill city builder that is overwhelming in possibility, it's almost perfection."
28754,it cool
28755,The best city simulator
28756,"Build, build, build,.. it's easy enough to get started but ultimately a deep experience. So fun and addictive trying to build bigger and better cities. Love the DLC, mods, and the community; so much fun."
28757,It is perfect if you want to spend many hours simply perfecting various aspects of your city.
28758,Great Game
28759,"This Game Is... A Masterpiece, This Game Is Way To Addicting. I Don't Know Why It's So Addicting But It Is. I Totally Recommend This Game Its Great. And It Supports The Steam Workshop. So This Is A 100% Yes From Me."

28762,Very good
28763,"This game is great! I got hooked after watching Biffa's video's on YouTube, which i recommend to anyone wanting to play this game. Without some expert tips and guidance the game can have a steep learning curve. Mods and an awesome community take those hurdles away. Combined with an extensive asset collection in the  workshop this game can provide days and weeks of entertainment!"
28764,"This game is boring and incomplete without mods, and the gameplay itself is kinda meh. But as a city designer and painter it is amazing, absolutely top of its league. It is however slightly let down by poorly optimized memory usage that means you can prevent the game from loading due to your RAM setting on fire if you are subscribed to too many mods and assets in the workshop.

My PC is getting on a bit in age and 8GB is just not enough. I'm currently waiting on some new x2 8GB sticks to arrive (do you know how hard it is to find DDR3 RAM these days!?) and then I'll be diving right back in.

A must buy if you enjoyed Sim City 4."
28765,the only thing im doing in this game is making poop volcanos
28766,wow
28767,Good game with lots of depth and replayability.
28768,Extremely fun game with a lot of opportunities to develop personal assets. Each construction can denote a new part of its own creativity that is built into the project itself. One of the titles that can definitely keep you nailed to an armchair for hours without you even noticing how fast time passes. An absolute must-have title that represents the top offerings in the strategy of the construction segment.
28769,"If you played SimCity 2000 as a kid, this is super fun. You like build a city and these little people steal from each other and get mad when you charge them taxes. You can build Florida and attack it with Meth if reality isn't enough for you."
28770,city
28771,"As a regular simulation city/life player, I really enjoy the game. I didn't notice a tutorial when I was originally playing, so I had to use some YouTube videos as a reference. It's a little hard to start out in the game, but once I caught on, it was a lot of fun. If you enjoy world building, I would definitely give this game a try."
28772,good
28773,the game is fucking garbage anyone who plays this cringe fag game is a fucking loser kys
28774,good
28775,I crashed my pc multiple times while loading the assets
28776,"Unfortunately I found this game really boring. Although better than SimCity games, the concept is totally unchanged from 20 years ago.  Zone here, Power this, Water that.  Oh no... you have a traffic/police/pollution/etc problems - big surprise.  What's worse is that there are so many dull options that it actually takes away the fun of the game.  
I guess I just felt almost no accomplishment from building a city and that's what annoyed me."
28777,"This game is super easy to pick up on but it keeps the challenges coming. You think you have a problem solved or the perfect city set up and all of a sudden citizens start getting sick, or new houses need to be built. There's a consistency of having just a few small problems to keep up on and keep everything running. Quite entertaining and attention consuming."
28778,"This game wouldn't be awesome without the WORKSHOP COMMUNITY. This is a SHOUT OUT to every asset maker and mod programmer who flipped this poorly optimized game (no offense CO!) into a magic sandbox that can still be played as a game if you feel like. But also a shout out to the developers to understand that a game like this needs a modding community.

Quite recently the community even created a FPS boosting mod that improves the frame rate drastically, how many games gets that!! 

A few of the DLCs are good and adds interesting mechanics, but it's the possibility to basically find every building, tree, prop or tool you might wish for in the workshop that makes me recommend it.

The only DLC that in my opinion is a must have: MASS TRANSIT."
28779,"Wonderful game. i recomend getting the match day expansion dlc. its free, and even if u dont like football, it helps if u train a good team for your city"
28780,"Love the game! But I do find I get a few glitches and the occasional crash, but they are rare enough that it doesn't spoil the enjoyment of it."
28781,"Amazing game, easily becomes addicting."
28782,its great
28783,Lovely game! Recommended!
28784,"Absolutely phenomenal game.

I've been playing this since early 2019 through my Xbox, and only recently purchased it here due to finally having a computer capable of running it and the luck of timing that with a great sale. It is honestly the best city simulator since Simcity 4, and although that is not such a high bar due to almost all city games since that one being garbage, it doesn't take away from the fact that this game is amazing.

Here's the thing, though:

You are going to HAVE to get mods, and maybe buy a few of the expansion packs in order to really make the experience worth it. Things like the traffic AI, the road building/editing systems, and other such mechanics are fairly lacking in vanilla, especially with the fact that the game puts such an enormous amount of emphasis on the traffic aspects of city building. TMPE is a absolute necessity, which luckily is free on the steam workshop.

So yeah, basically just get a few (or a lot) of mods and assets from the workshop and you're set for basically the best city builder of the decade."
28785,liked it
28786,"If you like watching cities grow, city-planning as a practice, and hyperprocessing everything going on, then this game is for you"
28787,sex
28788,"Amazing game. lots of official content. paired with the modding community there is nothing that can't be built. 

great game for anyone on limited network.additional content from the workshop has got an incredibly low data down load, the same goes for the initial game itself"
28789,"This is hands down the best city building game out right now. It caters for hardcore simulator players with different challenges and mechanics. For the people who just like building beautiful cities like myself, there are a ton of mods and assets made by this awesome community you can use to create your dream city. This is definitely one of my best purchases on steam!"
28790,Best city game ever since Sim City 2000
28791,just great
28792,boring
28793,"The best city building game that you can play right now. Get few of the important dlcs, check the steam workshop and you're all set"
28794,"Probably one of my favourite games to unwind to
- Really simple
- Never gets boring

Obviously if you intend to play in once city for more than 10 minutes you will need a supercomputer because this game is incredibly CPU intensive.

Also DLC, but this is a paradox game so what did you expect?"
28795,Awesome game ! 10/10
28796,good stuff
28797,"Great game,"
28798,Harika
28799,Good game never gets old.
28800,This game is very good and ADDICTIVE !!  It will consume all your free time.  You have been warned!
28801,I mean... It's Cities Skylines!
28802,Best city bulider available
28803,A very good city building game!
28804,"A nice chill game if you've had a tough day.

135 hours of playtime (at time of writing) and its hard to get bored, add a couple of mods to help with traffic and road settings and its even better."
28805,Best city builder since SC2K.
28806,It's alright
28807,I think this is a great game. I have been searching for something like SimCity to play for a long time and this more than fits the bill.
28808,Customisation and immense scale allowing you to sprawl as you please
28809,"I liked this game and played over 100 hours, but recently subscribed to a number of popular mods and assets and as a result my game crushes 4/5 times, there is little point to all these DLC and mods if they only end up worsening your game play experience and I have a relatively powerful computer."
28810,"It has traffic and taxes, nuff said"
28811,"It's Sim City. It's the best version of Sim City. It's the Sim City we all deserve. It's the Sim City that Maxis has been shooting for many decades.

Dead bodies are kind of a weird bottleneck though. Fortunately, mods will save the day!"
28812,Great game. Lots of DLC and mods available make sure to browse through them all and customize the game to get the most out of it. ENJOY!
28813,yup ehpic
28814,"it's very good, you can make your citizens drink poo water"
28815,"Remains the champ of city simulators. No game has the mod support that this one has. It is the Skyrim of simulation. I might go months without playing it, but when I come back, it is so much fun to watch your city grow and thrive. For any Mac M1 Apple Silicon fans out there, no problems thus far running all settings on max through Rosetta. Here's hoping a native build is forthcoming."
28816,"Pirated it, liked it, bought it. It's better than sim city. Combination of transport giant and sim city. More advanced. There's no alternative. WOuld be cool if we could build cities and than combine it with a military build up, like civ. Thats probably the next big thing."
28817,The email thing is annoying but its a good game
28818,"Recommend lots of fun
"
28819,"Finally I've decided to submit a review for one of my favorite games.

It has been a couple of years since I bought this game and I actually just play it every couple of months a year, mostly when I'm sick at home. Some of you may know the dilemma of growing up: You do not really have time for it, nor can all of you maintain a beautiful nice recent setup with good specs, since you have bills to pay and other stuff to be concerned about in life as well.

I love this game, almost as much as I love my brother, my girlfried and my cat. I will probably still return to it annually for a couple of days/weeks in 5 years and start building the first sewage pipe, manage traffic, be happy about that my city grows, supress traffic jams, make public transport profitable, keep pollution low, apply real world concepts to planning etc... Doing everything that makes a geography nerd happy like a child at Christmas and its birthday combined. This game is simply magnificent.
However, it's always the same: I mean, I know it, we all know it, I still play it, you probably still play it anyways. It is supposed to be like this. What I mean to me is, I can never finish something I have started in this game and still start allover again and again from the beginning, in the hope that maybe this time it is possible to finish, not much unlike Sisyphos rolling that rock up the hill for eternity again and again.

The reason why I have to start again and again is that the the longer you play with a city, and that is personally around 30 to 40 hours, it simply becomes unplayable. Those things are the most annoying ones:
- Mods tend to break the savegame when you let the game rest  for a couple of weeks/months
- The game time around 200k inhabitants becomes so slow, that it is no longer enjoyable
- Some strange errors/crashes occur, which you have to spend ours fixing/researching
Of course you say it is not alone the game's fault, it's the modders, my computers, or even mine, since I've decided to neither use my money to replace my broken fridge instead of buying a newer processor and more RAM for my setup, nor to carefully watch exactly what assets and mods I've included in my game in fall 2018, while I had the flu.

But it shouldn't be like that, the game shouldn't ask you for an expensive computer to play it, nor for not modding it to keep it playable.

To come to an end of my review... Steam has asked me, at least in the German client which I have currently installed: ""Do you recomend this game"" and my answer is unfortunately: [b]No, I do not.[/b] I don't want anyone to go through this process of getting addicted by a nice gameplay and not beeing able to finish their shit in the game, since it becomes less enjoyable, the more enjoyable your city becomes.
"
28820,Great game for amateur and aspiring city builders or lovers of urban planning. This game is somewhat realistic while still being fun and allowing you to build the city of your dreams.
28821,"I played Cities Skylines on PS$ but could not get any nods. I've just started to play on my Apple computer and I already like it better because I can install mods like TM:PE, Roundabout Creator and 25 tiles unlock. It's great. Tho my computer lags a bit, I still like it. I'll figure out the lagging eventually."
28822,Complex without being overwhelming. Beautifully crafted graphics. It has lots of 'real' elements interlinked to make this simulated city one of the best I have ever played.
28823,DO!
28824,"Big city, Much fun."

28829,Sometimes I spend 2 hours just building 1 interchange that I like.
28830,I love this game.
28831,Game is great but they completely ruined it by adding this spyware external Paradox Launcher. There are a couple of reviews here explaining why it's bad so I'm not gonna copy-paste them.
28832,"after all almost 1k hours logged on steam (and another 1k not on steam) i can safely say that 



GIVE US A NEW CITIES SKYLINE GAME ALREADY!!!"
28833,I lost so many hours playing it. I love it
28834,"Best city builder since SimCity 2000. With mods, the game is infinite."

But its not great fit for weaker PCs"

28842,"Good game, but lots of DLC for it reason is negative. 200€ for all content."
28843,gud
28844,love it
28845,Cities: Skylines gives you one hell of a challenge to start out. I found myself continuing to fail at starting a city but coming back time and time again to try and succeed. The game does not hold your hand does not explain many things to you. You will have to research and learn and try things out which is what makes it fun and addictive. It would be great to add a way to build a city with a friend natively built into the game rather than having to find a mod.
28846,it's good
28847,"great 10/10

28848,"Oh Neat, man i used to love sim city 3k back in the day i should try this... man idk why i used to like these games..

28855,Very interested. I've been playing every day even in my working place.
28856,"IT'S GOOD Y'ALL!

LIKE CITIES? LIKE BUILDIN EM? LIKE TRAFFIC JAMS? LIKE POOP IN YOUR WATER SUPPLY? HELL YEAH!
WELL BUY THIS GAME Y'ALL! IT'S GREAT!"
28857,"This is one of the best and worst games I've ever played, and I've totalled more than 3 solid days on it. Really like the premise of the building and city management, there are loads of really cool features that start from the ""left hand drive"" for us brits and stretch to pollution management. The transport management element is ultimately king, whether it's the road network or the trainline diversity you really need to keep on top of it and understand basic traffic calming measures (or at least you'll learn pretty quickly). 
If you like to just mess about, the sandbox option leaves you open to do just that, and with a whole host of mods you can do anything. The traffic management mods allow you to really play around with the best way to keep your city moving.
A definite buy, and thankfully i can play this on my MAC (without much issue) or my gaming PC."

THE FPS DON'T EVEN DROP, AFTER 4 TILES ARE UNLOCKED (EVEN WITHOUT USING MODS) 1 MINUTE THE GAME SEEMS FINE THE NEXT THE GAME JUST CRASHES UNEXPECTEDLY FOR NO REASON AT ALL!!!

I've been waiting to have it for years, so when the price was lower I got it!"

28869,ok

28884,"Very good, addicting too. you definitely will spend many hours with this game."
28885,Awesome city builder
28886,"The game, its fine, its good for whats it got, but all of that DLC, that\s more than *about* 250$ worth of american money, like seriously, if you just want a basic city sim, then this is ""fine"", but if you want natural disasters, or maybe snowy climates, you have to pay for DLC--- unless the deluxe edition fixes that, this game is fine, but i don't recommend it, simply because of this: 250+$ worth of DLC, YES, I play this game, but geez unless ima go out of my way to spend 40$ for the deluxe edition, its not worth it, thank you, goodbye."
28887,i have 29 hours in this games and the only thing i've done is flood the cities with sewage

28889,"Good game, shit traffic"
28890,m
28891,Best Simulated Game Ever
28892,fun.
28893,"The game is very great as it allows yourself to be creative while strategy-driven of designing a city. Cities Skylines vanilla is good on its own despite DLCs where the steam workshop has a wide array of mods to enhance your experience of gameplay. One complaint would be the traffic, which plays into how you design the layout of roads in your city. But, each map serves its purpose to help design an expansive city which will have you sucked in for day!"
28894,anies baswedan simulator
28895,"Great game, supposed to be everything city builders should be. DLC isn't neccesary and the community is great. I love how the game works."
28896,FUN SIM GAME
28897,yes
28898,"ill be fine with this game
"
28899,"What Sim City could have been. Kinda buggy, but all in all a great game made better with mods!"
28900,Kek
28901,"step by step gameplay tutorial:

1) try to build a beautiful city >> it's semi-beautiful at best and ur traffic sucks
2) ignore the problems and continue until ur city is in flames
3) try to fix the city
4) cry and start a new city
5) forget about a nice looking city, build a working city
6) fail
7) watch some dude build pretty and 100% working cities on YouTube
8) cry, download some mods and attempt again"
28902,"I could probably play this game for the rest of my life. It is the best relaxing after-work game. I've spent nearly 300 hours in it, and I'm sure I'll get to 500 really soon. If you like strategy/world building/simulation games, then I highly recommend this one!"
28903,"Brilliant Game, Can build the city however you see fit. Mod make it even more fun."
28904,It is amazing but pls make it so you can upload cities
28905,"What is there to say? This game is what Simcity was never able to be, extremely addictive. And the community support just keeps adding hours upon hours to the gameplay. Highly recommend if you like to use the creative side of your mind"
28906,only bearable with mods but its pretty fun
28907,"Great detail, would recommend running on an GTX 1060, or higher."
28908,"it good
"
28909,Fun. Bit of a learning curve but absolutely worth it.
28910,"I LOVE city skylines, everything you would want in a city building game, blows simcity out of the park with realism and graphics, amazing game. Good job devs!"
28911,"The trash collection system in this game has never worked properly without mods which is strange, but nothing to get worked up about since there is a mod that fixes the issue. This is a great game to have both a long playtime as well as a 15 minute session which still gives meaningful enjoyment. Only a city builder and doesn't include much interaction with the citizens themselves if you're looking for that sort of thing."
28912,i have made 20 utopias please buy this game it's poggers
28913,I liked everything about this game including the dlcs and the ever growing community
28914,"I recommend this game alot. I tried to find a game where i could build my own renaissance city. i bought Ostriv, which i didn't find as good. Instead i found this absolute treasure, perfect game. Without mods it's kinda dry, not as intriguing as it with mods.
However after just installing few mods and assets from the workshop, game became addictive and Opened a new world of architechture to me."

28916,nice

28918,"Game is still shit, so many bugs I think it would scare the crap out of Stephen King"
28919,The best city simulator I have ever played. The workshop has tons of extra material.
28920,Hours of fun. A real deal!
28921,nice
28922,"I would like to learn how the hell this game works.

I fire it up every now & then, just to make some totally atrocious, pile of wank city & lose all motivation."
28923,Great game to play and also a time killer too. I very well enjoyed it.
28924,"I used to play a lot of Sim City when I was a wee lad, but I would say Cities is even better in some departments. Namely you can do a lot of stupid stuff and just experiment with stuff if you want, but you can also take it a bit more seriously and just relax. Versatile game"
28925,"Don't buy if you have a deadline coming up, you're not going to want to put this down if you like city builders at all."
28926,awesome
28927,Fun and creative way to relax and play a game if you need a break from MMO's or other games :)
28928,.
28929,Just buy it already! A strategic city builder and management simulator that carries the torch for the genre.
28930,epic game
28931,"Getting the base game is a slippery slope to buying the ~200 bucks worth of DLC and this is clearly on purpose and no, no game warrants spending that much money on it to get the full experience

Thus, I cannot recommend this. These outrageous monetization strategies make gameplay entirely irrelevant.

Stick to one purchase games, where you get the full thing for one transaction. Not this."
28932,good
28933,There really isn't any challenge to the game.  A little common sense with the way you build your starting city and you will have a metropolis making you millions more than you can even spend in no time.  From there it's just about your creativity and seeing what you can build for the fun of it.
28934,"little difficult, I love a challenge.
"
28935,its so good game for a newbie at gaming
28936,It's very creative and the mods make it even better! Fun city builder.
28937,"Best city builder out there, it strikes a perfect balance of fun and complexed"
28938,its awesome. SIMCITY om steroids! Perfect!
28939,it's ok
28940,great game
28941,"I love this game lots! It properly satisfies my love for city building and planning <3 I especially like how vanilla and modded are practically two entirely different games. Do you care about the technical bits like money managing and keeping your population happy, you play the base game. If you simply go for aesthetics like I do, downloading lots of custom assets and mods from the workshop will completely transform the game into an artists dream."
28942,.
28943,"Overall a good and straight forward simulator with a lot of options to express yourself by building your dream city the way you want, a LOT of mods which is great. No major bugs and pretty fun to play, but Paradox being Paradox means that in order to really experience the game you have to buy all the DLC's which costs a fortune. 8/10"
28944,"I sat on this game for years wanting to buy and finally did when it went on sale. This is game is so bland and easy it reminds me of what ANNO did to their series in-between 1700 and 1800. within 2 hours I had a positive income and was building cities, there are no objectives or anything overly challenging and takes no real skill to play..."
28945,"I LOVE THE PRODUCT
"
28946,"goood game :)
"
28947,"Pretty great city building game. Requires alot of management, but its easy to learn. Most DLCs arnt that great, but there are a select few that i recommend. The workshop is pretty great too, though once you enable a mod, you will no longer receive achievements in that save"
28948,Great game for lockdown. Lots to learn and you can add to it.
28949,cwl
28950,"[h1]10/10[/h1]
When I played it, I didn't sleep for 2 days."
28951,It's a vibe
28952,Great game you can pass hours and hours on it!
28953,"There are so many things you can try out, from road layouts to early planning to prevent late-game problems, you never feel like you've done everything."
28954,"Congestion simulator, DLC pusher. Kids will tell you you're doing your road layouts wrong; while you can go totally overboard, making your layout resembling a sane reality is a no-go. Fact is, the amount of goods transport required in one year irl is done every 10 minutes in this game. Furthermore, the private driving is way exaggerated as well. It leaves a ton to be desired all-round. Feels like a beta. Unplayable without an ocean of mods. The traffic AI is the most infuriating aspect. Next to no standard traffic rules are followed, like priority to the right; vehicles will drive out in front of other cars, making them stop and clog up. Intersections are an absolute clusterfuck. Without mods, only one lane of multi-lane roads are used; imagine a 2km line along the highway in one lane with two others empty. Imagine 30 cargo ships in a clipping line waiting to drop off goods. You have zero overview of production amounts, barely anything in general. Very little control of anything, it basically plays itself, overall badly. The only challenge is good road flow rate. The game has zero goals. It's like heroine. It's soul wreckening, empty, yet thoroughly gets you addicted; that's not a good thing, it merely shouts potential, making you long for a fix, but ultimately delivers disappointment; I wonder if they purposely didn't make it fun beyond hooking you, so you'll buy the vast DLC in hopes the game becomes proper fun; there was a South Park episode about that: ""Freemium Isn't Free"", look it up on Youtube; ""It has to be just barely fun, if the game was too fun then there would be no reason to micropay (buy DLC) to make it more fun!""; only difference is that the game isn't free. There's so many horrid or lacking aspects to point out that it could fill a book. The devs said ""lets go overboard with traffic"", and then said ""it's way too much, the solution is to despawn vehicles when their trip took too long, fuck immersion"". Overall it's an awesome concept done horribly, very lazily and with little attention to detail; it very much lacks obvious musts, like being able to see how much money a train station has made, or how many costumers it has had (beyond the past 60 seconds corresponding to a week; most often it shows 0). You'll be blind to your entire infrastructure because you're told nothing. Eg. I have no clue whether my cargo harbors or train stations make money, or if it's free services; I have next to nothing to base optimization on. There's probably guides telling you all this (though you'll still be blind to statistics), but I prefer the game making it known, otherwise what's the point, if you have to study outside it."
28955,Very realistic if you use mods.
28956,I simply like this city builder !
28957,"This is an absolutely amazing game! it has been my dream game since 2018 and bought it just a month ago. the music, graphics are all very good but the best part is the unlimited opportunity and the amazing support from the community! best city builder game and i fell in love with it. worth every penny i paid(i bought it off discount so a perfect deal)! strongly recommend this game!

A few things that I wish Paradox improve on:
increase the content for the base game. a base game without DLC feels like a naked man. though it is playable, I would still suggest adding more base content.

also, if you are new, DEAL WITH TRAFFIC USING MODS. the biggest challenge of the game is traffic, and I think paradox purposefully made it so that vehicles in the game are dumb and only stick to one lane unless you force them to do otherwise using mods. A bad traffic system can be catastrophic to a city of large size as services and goods cannot be transferred efficiently.

other than that, enjoy the game and have fun. you will not notice the passing of time when playing the game."
28958,"I really like this game, through this game I learned how to strategy a city that was originally empty and now has a lot of people, From this game I can also create my dream city."
28959,"I mean, come on. yes!"
28960,"This program is great for people who loves a thinking strategy and design experience. Like any creative software, your city can be a work of art if you put enough effort and time into the details."
28961,"Fun when it works, but it often does not.  I've saved a game normally in the evening then gone to bed and the next day it crashes to the desktop on startup.  No changes to the system or software between bedtime and breakfast.  No warnings or errors.  It just stopped working.  Not a game I'd recommend to my friends.  Maybe if they're not my friends..."
28962,Best city builder on the market IMO
28963,"I Like it.

You have done a fantastic job!"
28964,skyscraper??????????????????????????????????????????????????????????
28965,kinda boring but fun for people who like building cities
28966,its good game 10/10 laggy tho lol bye
28967,m
28968,its a good game
28969,"TONS of fun! Very intuitive controls, great tutorials, terrific community of developers, and excellent game support."
28970,An absolutely immersive city builder that I can't seem to quite stop playing.
28971,"One of the best city builers, but unfortunately overpriced. While I haven't necessarly played it a lot yet, I do love city builders and this one is great."
28972,yeet es gud
28973,"[h1] Cities: Skylines /h1]
[hr][/hr]
Cities: Skylines is great game for anyone who whants to create something, may it be a little village or the biggest city you could image. (there are limits obv.) 

I've spent a lot of time on thinking about how i place certain public service buildings or just simple roads, but it was always a pleasur to see it work at the end. Thats just one of the many parts that makes this games a recommedation.

28976,"okm cppl dgamwe right stea,m"
28977,"The possibilities are almost endless. The only thing that is really going to limit you here is your own imagination. The game does a good job of starting you out slow, and slowly ramping up the intensity of things for you to take care of or tend to. You will find yourself wishing you had done this or that, instead of what you originally did in your design that would have prevented, or solved an issue that you didnt see coming. That adds to the replay ability quite a bit. I have started a fresh map countless times because I had a new idea for a more efficient traffic flow, or zoning of commercial / industry / residential. You can design your own mass transit system(s), cargo routes, traffic patterns, Elevated rail system, bus routes, etc. to get your citizens around town efficiently to and from their work and play. If you loved SimCity back in the day you will really love this game. It is really good at sparking your imagination and getting the creativity flowing."
28978,"great game to waste hours on, was shocked when it told me i had clocked in over 300 

well worth it for builders like myself, exactly what the community wanted 

thanks"
28979,good
28980,"you can make your citizens drink their own sewage.

9.5/10"
28981,Its pretty dope. DLC is annoying tho
28982,You can make a city of your own
28983,ce jeu rend FOU
28984,e
28985,"great game very relaxing iwant my wife and kids back now
"
28986,Love this game so far. Sometimes I do need breaks from it because it can get repetitious sometimes.
28987,"Great game! Allows for lot of creativity, and the ability to easily add mods adds heavily to the experience."
28988,I like it!
28989,"This was the first Steam game I have ever purchased, and it definitely helped me continue on with steam, as this game is amazing! I'd definitely say this is better than SimCity for sure, so if you have to choose, pick this game instead."
28990,good game
28991,yes
28992,very good game
28993,Excellent game! It has so much you can do and many amazing mods and base features. Extremely entertaining and designed.
28994,"this game is very realistic for city game.very recommand
"
28995,good.. i'm very happy for this game :)
28996,Too few maps without paying for expansions
28997,"Tried to give my town tumor babies from all the polution, didnt work. so i removed all the police in the area and killed them off. finally I took away most of there water, #nofilter"
28998,Best SimCity-like game by 2020
28999,"Relaxing and chilling
"
29000,"I remember playing Sim City endlessly as a kid, and most of my cities were on fire, citizens fleeing, and non functional. Decades later I found Cities: Skylines, and the only things to change are the graphics (My cities are as beautiful as they are poorly run) and how many things I can place in my cities."
29001,"gud geym
"
29002,e
29003,Already addicted after only a few hours.
29004,"Cars will never follow the paths efficiently like I want them to, but besides that this is THE city building game since sim city died off. I'm not complaining cause this game is great, but it is annoying that there aren't more games in this genre."
29005,get a life.
29006,"its fun 
"
29007,Best Simulation game
29008,<3
29009,"Probably the best city building game on the market. It has pretty much everything you would expect from a game like that. Apparently there are a lot of mods that make it even better but I did not get to try them. I am not the biggest fan of the genre so it became quite repetitive for me soon.

Pros:
- Gameplay mechanics
- Easy to learn
- Tons of options
- Mods

Cons:
- Repetitive
- Expensive DLC with lackluster content

7/10"
29010,Great Game!
29011,"It's a great city simulator, and it's transit systems actually work."
29012,This game is one of the best games on the market. Pick it up learn it live it love it.
29013,great game must play
29014,Great City Building Game
29015,"Enjoyed the game quite a bit for several hours, 8 to be exact, until I had nothing left to do and was peered into buying DLC's to explore additional content. Gameplay is great, graphics are beautiful, easy on my PC and plenty of challenges. But I dont find myself paying more for additional content relentlessly to feel a fulfillment from this game."
29016,A total favourite & my children have also really enjoyed learning from it.
29017,quiet fun
29018,yes
29019,Super-interactive
29020,Really good game!! like how real it is. (:
29021,"Nice relaxing game, that you can spend endless hours playing."
29022,I always get to a point where I realize my terrible road system has doomed my city from the start. It reminds me of being stuck on the 5 lol.
29023,Awesome and fun
29024,"If you like city building sims then you need to own this game, there's no two ways about it. I have bought the base game and multiple DLCs on both PS4 and PC, I can't put my finger on what it is but I am constantly drawn back to the game, creating a new city from scratch has never been this fun! Whether you are the casual player who isn't keen on getting into the finer details of crafting and managing an expanding city, or the meticulous kind who needs to have a hand in everything, this game caters well for both sets. Throw in the numerous expansion packs and you have a game ready to take hundreds of hours of your time off your hands."
29025,Better than Transport Tycoon wow !D
29026,"I have no Idea what im doing, im fairly sure I've accidentally committed several war crimes trying to satisfy my citizens"
29027,"I've been playing Cities: Skyline on PS4 for a long time, this is my first time enjoying the game in PC, and love the mods.   The only thing I hate is that you can't use the same modes on the PS4, I wish we could have Traffic Manager on the PS4 and the move it Mod."
29028,It is way better than mobile city games
29029,Hard as hell you need lots of time and dedication to play this game.
29030,This game is a black hole for your free time. 10/10
29031,AMAZING
29032,i like it before now it is trash
29033,:)
29034,"The best city building game ever. I recommend to everyone, but it's not like mobile city building games, you need to think like a city planner."
29035,":D
"
29036,this game will steal your soul 10/10
29037,"sims but, cooler"
29038,challenging and rewarding
29039,It's sort of a soothing game to play. Like raking the sand.

29041,Its an amazing games
29042,"This review is like decades late so here we go.

This game devours your life in a way only model train sets were ever capable of previously. The modding community is keeping it alive and well.

An absolute fucking masterpiece of city designing games.

10/10"
29043,10/10 would overload my PC with too many mod assets again.  Ram Usage Simulator is what this should be called.
29044,dope
29045,It is an addictive city simulator game. Lots of detail and many functions.
29046,"It's too easy, so I prefer Sim City. But still a good city builder if you prefer a sandbox type game."
29047,This game is cool and realistic
29048,12345
29049,I love this game I have it on PC and Switch so I can play it on the go......
29050,ye

29054,This game is extremely fun and addictive! Sometimes it does get boring but I always come back and have been playing for years.
29055,Society
29056,Super good game
29057,"its what a good time killer for you have it 9/10 because have to wasted money further more for the dlcs
"
29058,Very fun
29059,"new york
"
29060,this game needs to have better stuff like some thing to get rid of ground pollution and make more stuff free like dasters
29061,it fun
29062,LOOOVE :) :)
29063,love it
29064,My favorite game :)))
29065,"day 56,
 the game has finally launched"
29066,"Great Game. It allows you to create cities of many kinds (mod and DLC permitting) in different scenery, which allows for a high level of interest and replayability."
29067,Great game to get lost in for hours on end. great fun all around. 10/10 would recommended. Most of the DLC can be avoided.
29068,Really Fun game.
29069,nice
29070,"How to create Detroit, MI"

29075,"never ending puzzles  to solve
"
29076,nice
29077,We shot live aid on day 1
29078,Its very realistic. I just love watching my city grow. I also added on the disaster feature which makes it a lot more fun.
29079,"its awesome, just get it."
29080,"It has a lot of play ability, sadly there is a lot of DLC. I would not buy this game or the DLC unless you get it on sale. The workshop has a lot of stuff in it as well. 8/10."
29081,generally a pretty decent game :)
29082,"build thing, thing die, restart, build new thing, fail, restart, build thing again, and again, then realize you've been playing for 5 years straight non-stop, life suck, good game."
29083,Great Super Fun and Relaxing and Realistic
29084,"I was a fan of earlier version of the competing game by EA, but Cities Skyline is far superior to to latest version of the EA franchise."
29085,"Brilliant game you can sink a lot of hours into without it feeling like a minute. A good base game but for it to be a brilliant experience you need to get the DLC, it adds so much to the game to make it incredible"
29086,So fun and good graphic
29087,goood
29088,"All I do is stare at intersections for hours.
10/10"
29089,YES
29090,Addictive with good mods that make up for most deficiencies.
29091,
29092,done done done
29093,solid game
29094,"even now after years of it being out its still and awesome game
"
29095,TIP:Dont get to much pollution arond water or it will get polluted
29096,Yeah!
29097,"the next generation of sim city, highly customizable, and very fun! 
it is the minecraft of city building games"
29098,Amaze
29099,"Almost perfect city simulator - complex, detailed, and customizable - some very goods mods out there as well. The tsunami disaster can get glitchy on some maps, but otherwise runs pretty flawlessly."
29100,It's a complex as you make it. You can start out with a small basic grid and work up to making full-scale realistic cities that function correctly. As an american I overuse grids but some of the European folks you may see online make very different cities and.... ya know... also know how to correctly use train stations lol.
29101,VERY RELAXING
29102,Hands down the best traditional city builder on the market.
29103,Chill city builder. I recommend playing with the traffic manager and move-it mods for quality of life.
29104,"Great game, but very processor heavy. Very slow on low settings on my laptop. You need quite a lot of power to enjoy it."
29105,You want to watch hours of your life dissappear? You wont even notice as you get addicted to building nice round-a-bouts
29106,With workshop items it makes for a lot of custom building items to suit your own style if you were mayor. 5 Stars!
29107,ver gud
29108,Best City building game with no pay2win.
29109,Relaxing simulator.
29110,Once you start playing it's very difficult to stop
29111,This game does city simulation right.  The minor details are amazing and the amount of management and mod development is second to none.
29112,"Addictive and enjoyable
"
29113,Undeniably the best City creation game ever made.
29114,I love this game so much. its so relaxing and chill to play. Best sandbox game in my opinion
29115,"Firstly, I'd like to say that I really enjoy the game. The developers have done a great job - however I can't play the game on linux anymore because of the Paradox Launcher they added. Why does it need a launcher in the first place? It worked so well before!"

29117,Great game
29118,"I was expecting a dumb game with simplified algorithms but this is on a completely different level. Residents use your structures. Your decisions matter. 
And the community is just plain amazing."
29119,"If you would like to spend hours building a city, Then realise your roads are jammed up so knock down houses to build more roads, then realise you cant make enough money because you knocked down all the tax paying houses so build more elsewhere to then find you need shops and bus routes and that makes more money but then buy an airport and start loosing money... Well this is for you, after nearly 200 hours building and modifying my city, I'm still fiddling with it."
29120,"A solid city sim, zen like and granular to the core!"
29121,"It fills the void that sim city left
"
29122,this game feels polished and well-developed
29123,"This game sucked me in almost completely. 
I'm playing computer games since 1993. Each decade has it's legendary games of various genres. This one I believe will become legendary too (if it isn't already)"
29124,Great city builder!
29125,Coo
29126,fun ryan winkler sucks at it
29127,awesome
29128,"Most expensive sandbox puzzle, ever.

Buy it at a heavy discount, not at full price. At least 50% off for everything, all DLCs. Then the price point is reasonable.

The game basically rotates around controlling traffic congestion. This is a fun puzzle to solve, and it can suck you in for long periods of time as you can see from my hours played. Traffic is almost always going to be your limiting factor to expansion, and will control how you expand. Coming up with new and creative ways to solve logistics problems is literally my job, so doing this in another way is a great outlet for me.

I had fun."
29129,Is cool
29130,It has a good level of game design without going overboard on the micromanaging aspects.
29131,This game is good you can make a ton of citys and idk what else to say. 4.8 out of 5
29132,Great for creative sandbox play
29133,cool game
29134,You will lose hours of your life playing this game. Don't worry about uniformity and just wing it and you'll have more fun.
29135,"Best city builder game on Steam!  Although the DLC is quite the fucking blatant scam.  Other than that the base game is very fun!

8/10 greedy ass devs"
29136,Nice Mello game
29137,The true 21st century successor to sim city 2000.
29138,awsome.
29139,this game takes a long time before I even notice. LOL
29140," Good game, easy to start, hard to master"
29141,"Citie skylines is one of the Best Modern Citie building games out there.

The dlcs Do make this game a lot better but  can be a little on the pricey Side But a Great Game."
29142,"If you like city building and designing this is the best game around so fun and the mechanics are very good for how little of these games get released, my only gripe is that when you get to larger cities you need mods to control the sheer amount of traffic. Other than that i wish they would release the dlc for cheaper or at least made more of it free... other than that it is imo the perfect game all time favorite game for me."
29143,"very nice
"
29144,ha ha traffic go brrrrrrr
29145,Great game lots to do
29146,"One of the best city builders in some time. Cities: Skylines is almost what every Sim city 4 fan wanted 5 too be. This game and its expansions are well worth it (with one or two exceptions). But the game has been out for some time now, making some of us eager for a sequel."
29147,I built a sewage river and a filled a hole with poop. Great Game!
29148,"Best game!!! Play when your bored. When you have time, it is good!!!"
29149,It is a great game if you like the challenge of building infrastructure to be efficient.
29150,10/10
29151,This is an awesome game i have never seen in my life till now. I would refer this as the best game for me.
29152,didnt stop playing for 12hrs straight. would recommend 10/10 life waster
29153,"if they ask me for water one more time, I'll kill them all"
29154,Bob the bulider
29155,I wish i could make atlantis or a flating city but that hasnt stopped me from playing 150+ hours. love this game.
29156,"I have to give it a thumbs down for one big point.

You have a very small area in which to build your city. Once you have filled it, there is no more space to build and you come to a dead end. Every city expands to take up far more space when more infrastructure is needed, but this game will not let you do that."
29157,"Greatest city-building of all time, as off 2020! And since the developers made other managing games, you'll have your hands full with organizing traffic from daily workers to subways, trains trams and many more."
29158,"A nice mindless city building ame. 4/5 I like it, not much to say other than get mods for it, those make it alot better."
29159,yes
29160,pretty good
29161,This game is exactly what we all wanted sim city to be and more so if thats what your looking for this is the game for you
29162,It's nice and relaxing game but when i passed like 60 000 of population i started to have big traffic problems...
29163,"This game is almost perfect but the only problem is:
when i use the mod, TMPE the game will crashed or become not responding when i entering into a new or existing city.
Any idea or way to solve this problem?"
29164,Into architecture and playing god? well this is the game for you.
29165,
29166,"I live in the Philippines and our capital, Metro Manila, suffers from poor urban planning. Playing this game helps me cope and release my stress as I feel like I have control over how a city runs. The game is challenging in a way that you have to plan how your city should operate and how the zones and industries would work well together to improve the welfare of the city as a whole. Great game!"
29167,Cities is the game Sim City should have been all along.
29168,its good
29169,This game is like a better sim city
29170,"its amazing.
"
29171,I mclove it
29172,"[h1]Best City Building Game[h1]
After years heard about this game, finally getting this game this year (2020). This game is quite fantastic, with all the available mod to download, this game still feel like a new game. The only downside is, you need a loot of ram. Although playable with only 8 GB of ram. I am gonna upgrade the number soon enough."
29173,"love this game, great past way to past time"
29174,"Fun game to kill your time
performance is good no lag or whatsoever"
29175,Addicting
29176,good game
29177,It's been over a year since I first played and I still come back to this game from time to time. Let your creativity run!
29178,perfect game to understand mayors mind
29179,i dumped poop in lake and made peoples drink it
29180,"3D details work great, detail is exceptional. It's been a couple years since I used it so giving it some more time this winter!"
29181,fun with mods fun with DLC fun overall nice
29182,A unique game. I can play it for hours and still have something to do.
29183,i do recommend this
29184,ggfhgj
29185,very epic
29186,It's a great game that runs very nicely on higher end MacOS systems. As such it's a thumbs up from me!
29187,"A very good sim especially when you turn off notification of your pesky civilians. It lets me recreate a typical soviet style city, especially the Gulags"
29188,Best city building game that ever exists. The only downside of this game is the loading time
29189,"great
"
29190,"love the game. Made many scenarios but you learn as you create more and more. You will face many challenges while you play the game, but thats the fun of it no ?"
29191,"best city builder ever, steam has 11 hours but ive been playing it since release. this is the first game i got as soon as i had the money."
29192,You'll Love It.
29193,"The store page says the minimum required ram is 4GB, and the recommended is 6GB, but I have 8GB and the game crashes on city load unless I make my swapfile big enough, in which case the game takes up a total of 13GB, over [i]double[/i] the recommendation. This is with no mods or DLC installed."
29194,8
29195,"Always been wanting to have this game for quite some time now but too expensive to buy the whole dlc. Worth the wait, eventhough some dlc are not that essential mods are more of a necessity than some of the dlc. but still it's fun and the community just keeps this game alive glad to be on board on this one"
29196,"Great game!! I have always liked City building games but this one it the best I have ever played.... !
Still a lot to explore and learn but the graphics and simulations are more than awsome.."
29197,10/10 spent 20 hours on an interchange and had fun somehow.
29198,it fun
29199,love this game
29200,Good game.
29201,Water pollution 20%
29202,I accidentally deleted a dam and flooded half my city?
29203,"its Better then Sim City, Love it."
29204,There is a dead body waiting to be picked up!
29205,"Sim city 4 was my childhood favorite game and this game brings back the carefree, fun little kid in me. This game gives me a good creative outlet and helps me de-stress. 

Pros
- Easy to start, but tons of research / experimentation required to get very good at the game. Gameplay kinda mirrors reality as I've found myself researching real cities for inspiration / ways to solve my city's problems.
- Doesn't require a high end gaming computer to run. 
- Good radio music / soundtrack
- Has active mod community that allows for even more gameplay

Cons
- No multi-city or region play, but districts somewhat solve this.
- Base game doesn't have that much and expansions are expensive when not on sale
- Would've been nice to have a feature to walk around / drive in your city, (there's a mod for first person view, however). 
- minor: Would've been nice to have the real-time graph views like in Sim City 4 without having to pause the game"
29206,"I gave this game a second chance recently and I'm rather liking it. I feel like the starter hints and help could have been better. My first time I ran out of money in seconds and didn't want to continue playing. I watched a few youtube videos and had a decent city going without issues. Rather fun game over all, i do wish you could move things easier rather then just bulldosing them. It is the kind of game i wanted to play without the pay walls all over the place."
29207,Good Game. Like FS 19 It needs mods to be great
29208,goooood
29209,It's a game. It's good. Yea.
29210,yep
29211,"shit
even more shit it's like a toilet so full of shit it doesn't flush anymore and instead they've used the bathtub which is also full of shit and shitty toilet paper"
29212,very nice game was hoping for strip club dlc
29213,"This game at the base is amazing. It's way better than (sorry Maxis!) SimCity ever was. 

Add on top of that one of the best modding communities I have ever seen. Think of anything you want to add to your city  or new mechanics to fine tune with? The workshop has you covered. 

I'll easily sink another few hundred hours into this game, who knows maybe more. It's an instant classic.

""There's a mod for that"""
29214,I like this game because it is realistic and helps you understand work and industry in the real world.
29215,"gud

29216,< simcity
29217,Best city building game after sim city..
29218,Very Enjoyable
29219,"2/10 it was very good and deserves no recognition for it
"
29220,If tycoon games is your thing this game is for you
29221,its a lot of fun and its challenging too. love the concept. the details are really something in this game
29222,iuo
29223,"You can dump all of the city's sewage onto a hole in the ground

11/10, recommended"
29224,This is a superbly detailed and rich simulation with endless challenging and diverse options.
29225,"The best game, period!"
29226,"fun
"
29227,Ok game
29228,"It's bug free, greatly entertaining with loads of detail.  Good value to money.
"
29229,Maximum tax limit prevents me from creating my communist utopia. I am going to play sim city.
29230,Very Good
29231,good game.
29232,"the most good looking citybuilder out there, however you need a real powerful machine to run it."
29233,Me siento un Picasso Planeador
29234,Good Game to challenge your city building skills. Spend many enjoyable hours building editing and improving
29235,Pretty good game vanilla but a lot more fun when you use mods.
29236,iconic
29237,"I love this game but It has a major problem. When I started playing it, I couldn't get off so my kids starved! I don't know where my wife went but hey, my city looks awesome so overall 10/10 game but 0/10 for time management."
29238,"game good
"
29239,Good
29240,its fun
29241,"It's basically SimCity, combining some of the best elements of SimCity 4 and 5, with its own tricks up its sleeve, like letting you annex land and make your own pre-designed infrastructure to lay down (like roundabouts)."
29242,My City have big taxes. Exactly lifelike. 11/10
29243,"Way better than EA's SimCity, but sadly suffers from the same DLC problem."
29244,"I wish there was a mixed review button because that is exactly the type of review I am currently giving. To start off the base game is total ass and sucks my huge donkey sized nuts. If this was a review for the base game alone I would give it a NOT RECOMMEDED for sure. HOWEVER in the DLC it adds fishing industry.

This changes EVERYTHING.

With the addition to fishing in the DLC this really just BARELY makes the game postive. HOWEVER the base game containss NO FISHING so I wish I could make this a mixed review. Colossal Order GET YOUR ACT TOGETHER!"
29245,"Great game, best City building game by far."
29246,Bought this for myself as a joke. Stayed for the Gameplay. Well done lads
29247,Amazing game to just take your time. You can spend hours just trying to name every road and being satisfied when it's done. it has so much replayability and has great modding capabilities. Definitely a wonderful addition to any Steam library
29248,V GUD
29249,"Much better than Sim City, which was first city simulator I've played."
29250,I bought this game hoping to fill in the hole the Maxis left with the disapointing most recent Simcity. Im happy to say that this game acommplishes that and more. If I had ONE single complaint its that you can't go GTA in the game like you could in Sim City Rush hour
29251,"Excellent game, especially with DLC"
29252,epic game
29253,So good.
29254,"Interesting city builder. Hard to manage,but once you get it it is amazing:)
"
29255,love it would play everyday
29256,nuclear reactor go brrrrrr
29257,this is an amazing game that deserves recognition for its mechanics and content.
29258,amazing game
29259,"Great game gives you plenty to think about is a good time killer,nice enough graphics,maybe some more economy stuff would be good :)"
29260,engineer gaming
29261,Not ocd friendly without the mods
29262,nice game but how to get rid of the sound of the blue bird hiccupping
29263,"Pretty cool game but better with mods, mainly the ones to improve infrastructure of the roads."
29264,The best SimCity game in last decade.
29265,Good game.
29266,its good
29267,Good city builder game :) but prettu hard and you have to use brains
29268,Es entretenido y relaja bastante.
29269,Fun game to just chill on
29270,How to get city Skyline; city of tomorow :(
29271,I like managing traffic.
29272,very good game
29273,Great ganme! Much fun and very addictive! I could play for hours on end without a doubt.
29274,"Till date, this is one of very few games I never ever get tired of, and sunk in the most hours. Possibly even went for hours forgetting to eat at times. At least for me, the simulation and visuals are so immersive; very addictive just sitting back and watching the citizens go about their day, which isn't the best thing when the next day I have a busy schedule ahead of me.

There are many mods, assets and tools to download in the workshop, not forgetting the vast amount of maps.

The only problem I have till date, is the constant need to upgrade my hardware to continue playing this game as my city grows bigger and me adding tons of new assets, and not wanting to reduce the graphical quality because I am just too engrossed with; yup I am talking too much."
29275,"One of the best, if not the best city builder out there. Not much more to say."
29276,"Overall a great city-building game. Without mods or DLC, the game allows you to construct a functional cities that have logical demands with straight forward solutions. The workshop has a large number of mods that can further this playing experience, allowing for new settings or infrastructure to be built in your city. I've never bought any of the official DLC but it looks pretty cool, and they usually provide a free update when releasing new DLC, which adds some features in-line with the DLC release, which I've found to be pretty neat.

There can be some annoying problems that crop up in cities that become annoying to solve (death waves, not enough workers, etc.), although these can be solvable. I find that when the city reaches the max size limit, the game becomes a bit boring. You can always try to unlock all the monuments (or whatever they're called), but I've never found the motivation to do so.

9/10 Highly recommend"
29277,very nice building game.
29278,"Finally, the true sucessor of Sim City 4 is here to stay, dethroning the Maxis franchise for good. 
Paradox delivered the best city builder and management game out there, innovating the genre without compromises."
29279,"The only option to playing this game is re-creating the Soviet Union and torturing your civilians, so 10/10 ig."
29280,"the workshop makes this game from a 7 to a 9, its alot of and its hella relaxing would recommend"
29281,.
29282,"basically a much better and more in depth version of simcity, design and plan your own towns/cities, it's great"
29283,ggg
29284,This game is very enjoyable to play after a hard day of work. The perfect relaxing game where you can simulate and create your wildest city dreams and projects. I fell in love with this game and the beautiful workshop it has. The DLCs are nice additions to it and the  base game is outstanding. I recommend anyone who is creative and wants to explore city management to buy and play the game.
29285,"Cities: Skylines has been my favorite city builder for a while now. Most folks have compared it with Sim City, a game I have little experience with a long while ago. I compare it with the Anno series, although CS is firmly focused in city building and management rather than faction competition and conflict. 

While Anno emphasizes resource generation, CS's strength lies in transport networks. You can literally track each individual person, goods vehicle, garbage truck move around. They don't magically run on optimal networks and get everywhere on time. No, they get stuck in traffic for half a day :D. Trust me, you will find yourself neck-deep in traffic interchange research in no time.

The developers keep adding fantastic DLCs and there is a vibrant modding community to give you everything you can imagine.

'nuff said."
29286,this is some BS the game claims i have been playing for more than 8 hours yet it doesnt even open a launching screen it just keeps crashing and steam wont give me a refund. this is some BS
29287,It's a good game with great Steam Workshop support.
29288,"Like Minecraft, but different"
29289,It's amazing
29290,fun
29291,love this game to chill
29292,"I only have 120 hrs into this game right now but I can say that I absolutely love this game. The amount of content it has on Youtube, the number of mod support, the community everything is top notch amazing. Even without that, the game itself is a masterpiece non the less. I am planning on crossing 2,000 hrs on this game."
29293,"Great game, definitely scratches that Sim-City Itch, especially in the size and scale of the cities. Better traffic management and being able to make large agricultural/industrial areas not right up against the road would make this game perfect."
29294,cool idk

29296,Build -> screenshoot -> destroy -> repeat
29297,Great Game. Addictive. Many hours of enjoyment. Lots of videos with tips to get you started from community players.
29298,"This is the most sophisticated and well designed city building/simulation game I've ever seen. Infact, this game goes to being the closest representation of real life city building under my knowledge. I'd be really happy to see couple of improvements on the game though such as being able use workshop mods in offline mode and a dedicated version of this game for low - end PCs etc... But overall, it's a really good game and for me, a great value for price."
29299,Amazing game. Its just perfect.
29300,amazing
29301,this game Cities:skylines is very good game tame more game this game i like this game
29302,"Closer to a simulation tool. Great for experimenting with traffic and citizen flow.
A great challenge if you want to replicate your own cities."
29303,very difficult to get started.  very confusing.
29304,"Good city building game, you have to think of your zoning, transportation, keeping your civvies warm, TRAFFIC, imports and exports... very solid game."
29305,good game 9/10. very like
29306,"Awesome in depth city builder. Ends up being a lot of traffic management, which is tied into how your roads and city as a whole are organized"
29307,"gud game much like yasss + 4
"
29308,"A constantly growing game. For people who like to build, there is much to build, with many challenges, with a huge amount of DLCs. Plus even a mega huge amount of workshop items and choices. Constantly evolving. But what I like the most is the community support. Many people take an interest."
29309,"better than sim city 4
"
29310,Very Good would recommend
29311,The best city builder game I have ever played. Gameplay is fantastic. Great music in-game and cool downloadable content.
29312,A very well done modern city builder with unfortunate balance flaws but still a joy to play. Traffic mod though is a must or your city will never grow past 50k
29313,"This was one of my first city building games, and love it so much!"
29314,Buy the natural disasters dlc with the game.
29315,yes
29316,cool
29317,yeah man
29318,.
29319,"I love this game very much! Here is my review for it...
----------------------------------------------------
Graphics- 8/10 
I think the graphics of this game are amazing! It could use some optimization though.
----------------------------------------------------
Mechanics- 7/10 
The game truly does feel seamless in a way. I love watching the traffic flow, but vanilla traffic makes no sense, and could use some work. Another thing that could use a lot of work would have to be the terrain controls. Legit a pain to use.
----------------------------------------------------
Controls- 9/10 
Not much to say here! Standard WASD and mouse controls makes for an easy experience! 
----------------------------------------------------
Game play- 6/10
Now this game is great at what it is don't get me wrong but at the moment it's set up more like a freeplay game. I would absolutely love to see a career mode come at some point, but for now the sandbox style is still a lot of fun!
----------------------------------------------------
Duration- 8/10 
As I said in my previous category, this is more of a sandbox game which means you can easily spend hours creating and building up your city!
----------------------------------------------------
The final score for City Skylines is a 38/50 which is an impressive score! I say if you're looking to get a city building game, this is the one you should go for! Def one of my favorite games. Also thanks for reading! :)"
29320,good game
29321,good
29322,"Keeps me occupied for hours. I love these types of simulations for the PC. I would, most certainly recommend this item to others."
29323,"All of the roads are clogged full of cars and coal cannot get to the coal plant. The dead bodies cannot leave their homes, and huge conglomerates of factories are right next to the houses. Just like real life!"
29324,"Cities: Skylines has been a pleasure to play. It's often in the back of my mind even when I'm not playing. 

""Look at this design!"" 
""That would be cool to build in Cities!"" 
""I should try this or that to solve my traffic issues!""

Designing and building a city is always enjoyable. It was way too easy for me to overspend sometimes when I was putting my designs down, especially in the early game. But, it is a very forgiving game. Sometimes, perhaps too forgiving. I do wish the simulation for economy and other things was deeper. The game is mostly for designing rather than simulating. But, the design aspects were good.

The DLC could feel like a bit much sometimes, but it wasn't necessary to enjoy the game. Plus, it was often put on sale, so with the sale prices, I think it was worth it for people who really liked the game.

I'm looking forward to finding out what the devs are working on next. It's been fun."
29325,Every time I play this game it's to the absolute limit of my computer. Every time I upgrade hardware I continue the city to it's new limit. Both Colossal Order and the general community have long supported this game and brought it to its limits only to find new ones as technology moves forward. This is the ultimate city builder. I can only look forward until it shatters that limit as well.
29326,"This is one of the best City builders I have played in some time. If you like spending money in the real world and playing city building games, Cities:Skylines would be a game you may consider purchasing.. There is a ton of extra content to buy, and a great modding community.

I even read there is a mod to play the game online with friends building on the same city."
29327,pog
29328,City
29329,this game is very addictive. i just cant get off of it ever since i bought it.
29330,Very addicting and advise getting the DLC although the original is still amazing
29331,Simply the best in its genre.
29332,Its a really realistic game but if you have a not so good computer then your game will take a while to load like 5-30mins and it will be laggy but its my favorite game.
29333,fun
29334,"epic
"
29335,"Without a shadow of a doubt the best city builder out there, further improved by the quantity and quality of the mods available. Also, it maintains an interesting arc throughout the life of your city, which is not always the case with this type of game.

Note, you do need to enjoy hands on problem solving, especially when it comes to traffic, to fully enjoy this game. It also has, especially with high graphical settings and many mods, the potential of being a bit of a memory hog."
29336,One of the best cities planner game.
29337,Buy it.
29338,lots of content so I'm content
29339,If you want to build your dream city this is the game by the way dont buy it on consle its so much better on pc the dlcs are just a little over priced
29340,Great community workshop
29341,A masterpiece
29342,"Fantastic game, made even better with mods available on Steam. Would rate a solid 9.5/10!"
29343,"Really fun game, mods make it even better. 
Some of the reviews say you need dlc for the game to be good, so far for me that has not been the case,  but I will update the review if I think otherwise.
Worth the price especially since I got the game on sale for like $5"
29344,"GOOOD
"
29345,TAXES EZ MONEY
29346,"I built a dam downstream of my sewage drainpipes and it backed the water up all the way to the pumping station, which then incorporated the raw sewage back to the drinking water of every single person in my city. 728 people died. That's when I realized this was a good game."
29347,I love this fucking game
29348,"download the road tools and anarchy mods though, vanilla kinda ugly"
29349,"Still the best city builder out there,  Mods are great."
29350,Like to micro manage AI and let your creativity flow. Then this is for you!
29351,Best city-builder I've played. I really appreciate the Workshop support. Better than Sim-city.
29352,"One of the best games that I have ever played. Overall, great sim and I love playing this game."
29353,"Only thing I don't like about this game, is traffic is a mess, always. You put a 4 lane avenue, but they decide to just use 1 lane, forming huge jams.
 Luckily, there are mods to help there."
29354,"Another Paradox Interactive DLC simulator, but this time, instead of nuking Moscow 17 times, you build a city.

10/10. 
"
29355,"A Great City Simulation Game, I very loves this game..."
29356,Very nice city building game !
29357,ok
29358,ever wanted to play a game but instead of playing a game you spend 13 hours finding out how you're supposed to fix the fuccing traffic?
29359,"Oml this game is my life. I actually love it so much. It is so addicting and rewarding when you make a successful city! 

Here are some of the Best f(quack)ing things about this game:
-Realistic Graphics
-Beautiful sound design
-Great for streams (Pause time feature.)
-Addicting game play
-Massive community (Youtube tutorials, workshop items, ect.)

BUY THIS GAME. ITS WORTH YOUR DOLLARS"
29360,"Watch and learn, EA."
29361,odly enough and despite what you yourself might think this game does not get boring aftera short while. if you do get dlcs it will expand upon the already good base game. basically the game is good get dlcs later after you know you like!
29362,"Gud and fun simulation game
"
29363,"I would recommend this game very much to everyone but can be difficult to become very good at the game.

Brilliant game."
29364,one of the best sim game I ever played.
29365,Really good building game i recomend it.
29366,Awesome game that Im just now discovering. Such fun and a Decent challenge.
29367,best sim city since one of the sim city's
29368,best
29369,Imagine spending more times downloading mods than actually playing it.
29370,"This is what people hoped Simcity 2013 would of been. Very free form city building game that can be modded like crazy to become the ultimate city painting experience. Major complaint is how much of a performance hog it can get to be, but that's kind of why Simcity 2013 was scaled back so much so there's only so much I can complain there."
29371,I've really been enjoying this game. Some of the mechanics are a bit frustrating or tedious but overall I keep coming back for more.
29372,oh its good
29373,"After almost 90 hours, i realised that all of my cities ended being the same overtaxed, urban industrial hellholes with 10 lane highways, because it was more efficient than having a train station and an airport

10/10"
29374,Amazing and worth the money. its great break from my life.
29375,Nice
29376,I named a city after my crush because she wanted me to and she said no so now i have a save named after her. great game I recommend
29377,Cities Skyline has been around for a long time and is  always evolving!
29378,Play it with mods and you'll get the best experience.
29379,Makes you addictive. Highly recommended.
29380,You either recreate your city complete with their horrible traffic (or lack thereof) or create a paradise that you'd want to live in.
29381,"Yes, I can recommended to my friends about c:s. You build the city from your imaginaton from zero. Make residential zone, industrial zone, and commercial zone to improve the economy of the city. Don't forget to build power source, water pump, junk yard, hospital, police station, fire station, and park. Don't forget to manage traffic flow, electric and water needs, and your economy growth. The DLCs also not bad to get, i guess so. Don't have money to get DLC? Wanna some advanced tools? Wanna some exotic building and map? Go to community, there is a lot of mods!"
29382,"This is really the best city building game out there and is very addicting. 
The modular way you can build your many, many cities can be overwhelming if you're not prepared to spend a lot of time doing one thing in that one district of your cities.
"
29383,A great game! The tutorial doesn't help a beginner very well but after watching some videos on YouTube I was able to understand the game more. I'd definitely recommend it. Like the Sims/Tycoon style games but more detailed.
29384,one of the best city builders maybe the best
29385,"Best city-building simulator to date!


UPD @1k+ hrs: still the best in its genre!"

I just can't shake the feeling it's somehow too easy.."

29393,nice
29394,very good game
29395,play it and have fun
29396,Never ending game
29397,"It's an amazing city building game like never before. The fact that it's been several years and nobody else managed to make such perfect game like this speaks a lot. If you love city building, or even just the idea of making your own city, then you will need to try this. Don't be afraid for making a silly looking town the first time you hop on to this game—it happens to most players. Once you learn the basics, you can dive into mods and try adding things step by step. Before you realize, it'll be a new day, and you forget to go to sleep."
29398,"It a city building game. Your god, go nuts!"
29399,Its fun when you build the town and it gives a good sense of power but if you want you can build a town and then flood or kill them all or trap them in the town and murder them or build a poo cano
29400,pre good
29401,"love this game, runs really great on my pc which is normally slow"
29402,Awesome.
29403,"The definitive city builder for now, this is the one to get."
29404,Very Nice
29405,Something about creating a city from nothing with the aid of a brilliant development makes my heart jump for joy! Love it!
29406,"There are skylines, and they city."
29407,Amazing game. Easy to spend hours creating. Can have fun destroying cities if thats your thing. Lots to do. I highly recommend this game. The workshop adds a lot as well if you need free content.
29408,"A traffic management game disguised as a city simulator, and it's all the better for it."
29409,"good game
"
29410,this is a good game for chill out in the house
29411,looking for a city builder like this one.
29412,nice
29413,e
29414,Tasty game
29415,I'm hooked. It's literally perfect.
29416,"Great, my people drowned again in their own sewage."
29417,"Good game, lots of depth."
29418,"Trash DLC traffic simulator whose gameplay loop punishes you by spamming crime, bad healthcare, garbage, and so much insufferable shit you'll find yourself pulling out your hair just to maintain a shit hole of a town you made. Game is so bad the crime system spams theft from my power plants, despite the amount of police RIGHT NEXT TO IT."
29419,its fun
29420,very cool and im better at it than my freinds
29421,really fun immersive city planer game
29422,Is good.
29423,"Great city builder. Very addictive. 

Sucks that so many things were saved for paid DLCs rather than included in the base game. To get the full experience would cost over 200 bucks. So you end up buying a couple DLCs and still you're left wanting more. Real shame.

EDIT: Decided to change to a negative rating because even though I've enjoyed this game, I'm fed with the developers' habit of releasing bare-bones games at AAA prices and then charge insane amounts for DLCs that should've been in the base game.

Without DLCs, this is a decent city builder game, not much better than SimCity 2013. If you spend the full 200+ bucks to buy all DLCs its probably the best of its genre."
29424,"Cities: Skylines is a great game with an amazing community of players. I found it via Biffa on YouTube, and decided to get it because I liked the idea of designing a city and fixing it's traffic to run smoothly. After owning the game for awhile, I've found I love designing the city, shaping the layouts of roads, and putting landmarks in specific places. It takes a lot of RAM, and runs pretty slow on my MacBook Pro, but the fact that it runs at all on my MacBook is pretty great. I really like this game, and I definitely recommend it if you think you'll like a city builder or city simulator. The mods are a real game-changer, so I wouldn't play it on console.

9/10 solely due to the amount of processing power it takes."
29425,Solid game try not to get addicted.
29426,The ultimate time killer
29427,"TLDR: Good game, don't buy the DLC!

Every feature the DLC adds has to work semi independently from the core game. The result is every DLC is a half polished worse version of something you do in the base game. Overpowered industrial districts require a lot of micro management and basically staple a different game onto this game. In Park Life you build overpowered (seeing a pattern here?) parks that are ugly, especially when you are encouraged to fill every last square foot with leisure producing buildings. Trams and monorails are all cool but they don't have many interconnecting hub buildings because those transit types aren't in the core game and they each fill a role that is already filled by another transit type in a better and easier fashion. Why do you add features that aren't orthogonal to existing features? Because they are DLC features! Leisure and tourist districts only have ONE level and don't have a custom zoning when that obviously would have been the way to do it. To many DLC features rely on half baked ideas around districts. Heating seems to be another utility much like water. Water pipes should have probably been added to roads or established automatically like the electricity grid. Dams are impossible to deal with without causing a dry river bed or a flood when you delete them. Exercise centers don't provide leisure but libraries do? Highways are hard to place in any pretty fashion and usually solve your transit problems anyway. The logic behind keeping your industrial facilities processing goods is odd to say the least. You have grain silos full of grain and with available trucks right next door? Nah, I'm just going to drive across town to get the grain! Your population goes out of their to get somewhere. Want to go to the park? How about the one all the way across town and not the one across the street?

Now the good stuff:

Performance is great! This is great to see especially since strategy games seem to slack super hard on performance nowadays.

Modding is great.

Trip and traffic view are great. Makes solving traffic problems possible.

Most importantly, core gameplay is fun!"
29428,.
29429,"city skyline is probably the most  timetaking game , but i love it"
29430,Decent Game
29431,Highly recommend.
29432,"I played all the Sim Cities - from the original on DOS to Sim City 4 with the transportation expansion packs. Then I tried Cities XL, but Cities Skylines takes the best of both of those and creates something even better. It seems to use the same DLC model that Paradox is doing with Stellaris where they don't constantly make you keep buying a new base game. Instead they make money by creating tons and tons of DLC. I think the base game has plenty, but the DLC is awesome! (I don't even have all of it)

If there's just one critique I have, it's that it extends the concept (I think first seen in Sim City 3) of having to manage resources from other cities or within your own city and I don't feel like worrying about mining and logging and so on in my city simulator!"
29433,"While I can't say I spent a lot of time on it (compared to a couple of players), I can only say that this is one of the best city-builders currently out on the market. You can really get lost in the details sometimes (I say that both as a pro and a con, though), but in the end, it is just enjoyable to sit down and spend a couple of hours with a city you've perfected (or not).
Definitely recommended."
29434,It's the best city builder I've ever played.
29435,Simply the best.
29436,Start making a city that people love and that makes thousands weekly and then mess one little thing up and start losing thousands and then you have to tax people harder and then they leave and then they are all sick for some reason so you build 3 more hospitals and then people are still sick and so people hate your city and you have to take out 2 loans and now you are in debt so you try and make more land for people to live but the people there are also sick and now your city sucks and your making people pay the max amount you can tax them and you are still losing thousands so you try to build a toll booth on the highway but now people cant leave because you cant build the second toll booth and you cant take out a loan because you still have to pay back the other one 10/10
29437,This is probably one of the best games I've ever played! 10/10. The only thing to be aware of before buying this game is that you will have quite a few rage sessions while playing since the traffic sometimes just start to randomly build up and they're (near) impossible to fix
29438,Unfortunately the game doesn't launch without the user having to browse countless fixes on the forum. This is a complete waste of time and bad game design.
29439,i just think its neat - Margerine Sompsan
29440,"Played this a lot after release and got very used to the plethora of mods and addons to the game that exists in the workshop. There simply isn't a better or more versatile transport/city building sim out there. If you like the genre, you will love this."
29441,"Favorite game of all time now, about year of ownership, my cities are terrible and loads of fun to fix because of community tips, info, guides videos....
I feel like Homer Simpson and donuts whenever I think about or play CS."
29442,.
29443,"Challenging learning curve, lots of long-term replay-ability and reward. There is a lot to learn here about how people imagine cities and sociotechnical systems. The traffic simulator in this game is truly top notch. Saying that one might enjoy managing traffic for fun sounds weird when you say it out loud, but the core of one's experience here is a control fantasy. I have used this in a teaching context without much success except when I find a student readily willing to sink 30 hours into the game. You won't learn much in the first few hours, and you learn by making a lot of mistakes. But it's meditative to learn how to roll with the punches provided in random disaster simulation, and accept that there are lots of things about your city that you can't reasonably control."
29444,What SimCity should have been. You can slowly build your dream city until the inevitable traffic jam appears and then you ruin everything when you try to fix it.
29445,great create the city
29446,Everything you'd want in a city building game
29447,I think that cities skyline is THE best city building game in the market today.
29448,"This game is so relaxing and fun!
My biggest City has more 60K+ people.
I love that Game!"
29449,"Very good game! addictive! 
however, it crashes a lot"
29450,gr8
29451,"Really truly enjoy this game, only have 40+ hours played, but can see myself putting many many more. Already have purchased several expansions. Highly recommend."
29452,"The vanilla game is limited and quick to feel unchallenged. Expanding cities gets too repetitive. A lot of the fun features are only with the DLC. I personally recommend the Industries DLC to keep things a bit more challenging. On the base game although there are different types of resources, but ultimately only the resource name and the buildings' looks are different, the way to build oil/forestry/farming industries are the same. The game doesn't require you to have multiple resources or any requirement ""to"" have any resource or gain any benefit from having multiple resource.

Despite that, I would definitely still see myself coming back to this game again sometime in the future, repeatedly. The base game still could serve as a fun thing to do once in a blue moon. It is still my first choice for city builder game."
29453,Very detailed
29454,Nice Game
29455,My Cities are better than yours!
29456,"Gameplay - Ultra Nice

Graphics - Resident Evil: Village

Requirements - Geforce RTX 6900 Ti (but with fps booster mod its playable on Radeon HD 5770)

Results: 8/10"
29457,a very enjoyable game. I do think it should be easier to build bridges og underground roads though.
29458,ITS AN OPEN WORLD GAME WITCH LETS YOU DO WAY MORE THAN A STORY GAME BUT THEIR AR CHALLENGES TO  OVER COME
29459,"nice game, i really like to create new cities and expand them"
29460,"If it wasn't for steam keeping track of the number of hours I have poured into this game I wouldn't be able to say. I enjoy the fact that you can pick up the game really quickly and each milestone adds in new elements to keep track of, increasing the difficulty overtime. The community assets and tools also make a more enjoyable and custom experience."
29461,Its just an awesome city building game to play

P.S.S idk why i nominated it, ngl i'm just addicted"
29465,haaaaa
29466,"The basic engine underneath is very mediocre and it's very difficult to build large cities (>0.5M), because there is a cap on the units like population and cars and this cap is reached easily. Also, you need mods to get access to the full playing area (5x5) but it's still too small.

Also, after years of release, turism is still broken completely."

29473,One of the best city management game in the history.
29474,"+ Amazing game to play when bored
+ Great graphics
+ Realistic and great workshop content

- Don´t buy if you have low-end PC
- Many bugs and FPS drops
- Original game does not include so much content and afterall you will be (forced) to buy DLC.

Overall, this game has beaten my boredness and is well-made."

29505,Very fun game. This game introduced me to Paradox and it holds a special place in my heart. Attention to detail and thoroughness are things that the devs have a lot of. Any feature you feel the game lacks in vanilla can be supplemented with one of the countless excellent mods that the community has made! Overall a very good game. The DLC's can add up but I don't regret any of them.
29506,its a very good simulator you get to build your city the way you want and have loads of dlc`s to choose frrom that add more complexity and fun to your city
29507,"Loads of fun, very carefree city building. Once you learn the basics it is hard to mess up. I do wish there were more real-time scenarios."
29508,"super chill game. great visuals, mod support and fun for hours!"
29509,Shame there's an engine object limit which prevents you from building anything more when using the map extension mod and laggy when you do build a lot. Not very optimized but incredibly fun and satisfying to spend hours on.
29510,"There is no argument, this game sets the bar for city builders. Is it perfect? - no... Are there some small things that piss me off? - yes... 
Is it the most well rounded city builder on the market today? - Absolutely. And by the way those small things that piss me off can all be fixed by the legendary cities mod community. 
Just buy it. Even if its just the base game you'll be hooked. DLC is mostly worth it. Read reviews or buy what your interested in."
29511,"Edit: Have very beefy computer to run mods or multiple DLC with. Also the DLC can be very expensive. 

This game is one of the best city building games I have seen, however a lot of the game is locked behind a paywall, however from what I've seen I find it worth it. However that is my own opinion of course. 

Now there are some things that game is really good at such as making your own large cities, or the cities of your dreams. However there are many cons of this game, such as the paywall that not everyone may find worth it. I've owned this game and played it on and off for around 3 years now and it is by far one of my favorite games I've ever bought, but I have seen the cons of it. While I have not experienced this, the DLC has caused issues itself when it is supposed to be compatible, the game can glitch and delete your cities (Happened to me with a city I had A LOT of progress on) and many incompatible mods as well. The game has of recently crashed then the city reloaded but it still kicked me out. 

Don't get me wrong however this game has a lot of progress put into it and can be truly realistic if you know how to make it like that. And it can support many mods and assets as long as you download the right stuff and can even work through multiple errors making the system very tough. It can also flag incompatible stuff and possible mods and assets that cause issues which can help track down the source of errors. You have to be in the game's loading screen to see this however. 

In summary this game has many pros, but just about as many cons. It requires a very creative mindset which I hope you have before buying this game. Remember to look through multiple reviews before you final choice. It will take a lot of experience and time to build up your cities also, so make a backup because risks will present themselves."
29512,cant stop playing
29513,"Great game, played it for days. Top DLC's: Park Life, Night Life, Industrial, and Campus"
29514,stuff
29515,great
29516,"Terrific city sim. This game made me interested enough to study real life traffic mechanics and solutions. The endless 'sims style' DLC packs bother me, but as a game Cities Skylines is amazing. This is THE city sim imo."
29517,"This is an incredible game. I've played it for years. It doesn't get old, consistently enjoyable."
29518,perfect for killing time :)
29519,This game is a fun and creative! It can also pose a challenge to those who want it! There is a huge community following that publishes new assets/mods keeping the game from becoming stale. EDIT *Nominated for award*
29520,"I've always loved city management simulations.  This game is addictive, very detailed play."
29521,SO FUQIN GOOD
29522,"After long hours, I had decided to say what I think :) Never ending story, u can play this game forever. The possibilities with mods are endless. Even if u stuck without DLC there's many mods which  u can download in the game which extend your fun in the game. Everyone should be able to find something for himself :)"
29523,"For some strange reason, the residents of ManBearPig Town HATE the sewer volcano I built as the centre-piece of the city. OK so it does overflow sometimes, sending the residents toilet muck flowing through the streets, but I think it does the job."
29524,Amazing game to relax and play
29525,it was fyaaaa
29526,fuck crashed
29527,I'm still building cities after all these years. It's fun to watch your city spring to life. I'll keep playing this as long as Paradox keeps releasing for it.
29528,I like it when they get in their cars and drive around
29529,"you can pump sewage into the clean water and make your citizens drink poop

10/10 would health hazard again"
29530,"Quick Review Time!

This game is one of those relaxing little games where you build you town and grow it overtime. It is very satisfying to keep expanding more and more and manage the several tasks from sewage, road traffic and demand for certain zone types just to name a few. You always got something to do and there is not an immediate danger if you mess up things, so you can usually always recover from bad decisions with time. The game is highly customizable letting you have a lot of freedom building the city the way you see its most efficient as well as the little details such as renaming buildings, roads and so on. Not to mention the mod support in the steam workshop, letting you build all sorts of themes for you cities.

For me most of the fun is in the beginning when you're managing a somewhat small city. when I get a big one I feel lazy and lose a bit of interest, But that depends from person to person.

Overall I like this game and would recommend, its nice to try to build your own version of your home city."
29531,ta potente
29532,"Once upon a time there was a game called SimCity . Back in the 90s it was one of the most innovated games of all times that put the foundation for a whole genre. Unfortunately a bad witch named Electronic arts killed it in a very brutal way, the last (2013) version was a disgrace. Thank god paradox interactive manage to resurrect it in the form of city skylines. City skylines is the best city builder this time, actually it is what a modern successor of  SimCity should be. 

Great graphics and game mechanics , very relaxing music and highly addictive gameplay. Moreover the available mods can transform the game to whatever you want . I can understand the negative reviews concerning the amount of DLCs but I am afraid that this is the price we must pay for the continuous development of the game all this years. I definably recommend it.
"
29533,stop sign go brrr
29534,Amazing game! so much power and control how you can build your cities. Even has mods that can help with traffic.
29535,"Was looking for a game to just create, and there is none better than Cities: Skylines. One of the best and most played games I have ever owned. 10/10 for me."
29536,"I have accidentally played nearly 200 hours of this game. It's very good, you'll find you've spent hours playing without even noticing the time has passed. Me and my boyfriend have spent much time forgetting each other exist by playing this game at the same time."
29537,good for building cities
29538,A very good game but it is a bit expesive with all the dlc's
29539,game is good.
29540,Amazing City builder.  Details amaze me.  Things have come a long long way since Sim City 2000 which was the last time I played this genre!

29549,i like this game A LOT!
29550,"Extensive, detailed city planning simulator with a sheer gigantic size of assets and elements from the workshop."
29551,Game with endless possibilities. The only game you really need.
29552,Amazing and relaxing game. It's very addictive! Recommended to people whom like to build whatever they like and to just rest up and pass the time. :)
29553,"Awesome game with hours of content. Basically what SimCity should have become, but without EA so a  bonus for all!"
29554,"This game is a Love and hate relationship. I love designing the city. Once i found the mods and assets I started really enjoying the game that much more. I hate that my gaming rig can't handle a lot of those mods and assets. 
 I love setting up the transit system and getting the traffic to flow above 85% all the time. I Hate that once you get to a larger city my gaming rigs cpu maxes out and things start to slow down. 
The one thing i do battle with is that after building designing and fixing my city i get bored with it and start a new one. 
But I do love this game. I just need a better gaming rig to enjoy it more."
29555,goog game
29556,Probably the best city builder on steam.
29557,"I absolutely love this game. There's so many different strategies and everytime I play, I learn something new for my next city.
I'm +120 hours in and I still have ideas for building my city I didn't try yet. The community behind it is huge and there are many free mods and attributes to make the game even more fun.

It takes a while for the game to get slightly boring and the DLC's get rid of this boredom pretty easily.
Definitely worth its price :) It's a game I will enjoy for many hours to come.
"
29558,"I like that's it's a solitaire game but I'm also able to invite others to see what I've done.  There's something calming about designing, laying out, and sometimes even destroying the different elements of the city.  And when I've done what I can, I can zoom in and see what the cims are up to until it's time for me to design and build the city up again."
29559,Traffics are getting pump up
29560,"Base game is enough, but adding extra content won't hurt. 8/10"
29561,Sank more hours restarting cities from scratch after coming back to the game a month later and realising this is an ugly city I made earlier.
29562,i had to switch from 16 ram to 32
29563,for the love of god please get the natural disaster mod its so fucking fun
29564,"I love this game, so much fun, even if you are terrible at it"
29565,Good game
29566,"good
mods make it better too

end of review"
29567,"Really nice game!
Just sit, relax and build the perfect city"
29568,The current king of city builders. A must have for any fan of the genre.
29569,Pretty good game sat and played for 11 hours straight I did continue to get frustrated when my builds were perfect but I kept sinking lower into debt. I would definitely recommend cause it's fun and addicting

29589,Great city building game. I used to play sim city 4 for so long (1000+ hours easy) and i wanted a change after getting board of sim city 4. this game has lots of what i want in a city building game and with the ablitly to change some things and make your own stuff its so much better.
29590,Build a city...They will come.
29591,Excellent game
29592,Would abolutely recoomend trying out this game...hours of fun and a great worshop and community..looking forward to building my cities...greetz Mac
29593,Simply love this game
29594,cool
29595,"Mods? Yes.
Multiplayer? No.

Things SimCity should of been?
2 out of 2"
29596,relaxing and fun with cool mechanics
29597,Pogchamp
29598,A great city builder with amazing mod support which is still being supported by the developers even 5 years after release. Some dlc are slightly overpriced but there are often discounted heavily during sales
29599,HH
29600,nice game
29601,"game is not bad, has it problems (traffic simulation worked better in sim city 4 lol), but with every single overpriced DLC they also make an update that basicly breaks half if not all of the mods. And GL searching for that specificONE that was not updated. Every day some mod upgrading in background each time you open a steam, just so you know you will not be able to play it since everything is crashing. I really wish the devs would stop breaking mod community every few months."
29602,hear me out NATURAL DISASTERS
29603,sexy
29604,THIS GAME IS AWSOME!!!!!!!
29605,A great city builder game. Especially with mods and dlc's.
29606,"tare rau sa moara ma sa
"
29607,yes
29608,"This game does a good job of scratching that city-building itch.  My main gripe is that once you get to the point where you can adjust your budget, which is fairly early on, the difficulty for city planning goes way down.  The main thing about this game seems to be traffic management, which I've beating my head against the wall with for several iterations.  However, there are some mods that I've recently started using that help greatly with road building, which can be incredibly frustrating in vanilla.  Issues I've had with that are mainly collision detection on highways and any kind of junction that is more than a standard four way road intersection. If you're a sadist and want to plan an intersection with any more than two more or less perpendicular roads, the snapping and errors with terrain elevation and locked-out sections of road can get frustrating.

Other than that, everything else is pretty bog-standard.  Provide services and make sure they have access to the all the neighborhoods you need.  Create districts that allow for city polices, such as no trucks or historical districts, or in the case of industry, specialized tracks (agriculture, mining, forestry, etc)."
29609,good game
29610,Perfect game for City construction simulation
29611,is good
29612,"The ultimate citybuilder, always a go to!"
29613,Basically the best city-building game nowadays
29614,Nice
29615,"I play this game, because it has trains.
I like trains."
29616,It good.
29617,Simply the best city builder ever.
29618,"Just try not to spend hundreds of hours playing this game. Spoiler: It's not going to happen. You will lose yourself in the ability to make a city, then lose yourself in the city management aspects, then lost yourself in the ability to upgrade everything. The only real downside is that there's a ridiculous amount of DLC, which means you'll spend more than the game's original cost to keep up with new content"
29619,"I had 4 problems when trying to play:
1. Couldn't use Right Mouse
2. Could barely play without game crashing
3. Game was VERY laggy
4. The textures weren't nice"
29620,nice
29621,VERY HARD WHICH I LIKE!
29622,"One of the best city builder games I've seen so far, if not the best of all. 5 years have passed since its launch date and it still have great updates and expansions. Even with only the base game it's such a great game to play, I've lost the sense of time many times while playing it. The mechanics should be more friendly-user, but fortunately there's moods for it. The price of DLCs is a bit of a con for me but if you're a passionate building gamer then it's worth it. I might say it's the only building game you'll ever need"
29623,A great time killer and something to mess around with when you have the time to/ bored
29624,"Simply a masterpiece. This game is a must play game who loves any kind of Sim game.
For others.... Try it you might start liking Sim games.

So many expansions and so many small details in building a well built city. Thoughts well put. 
Great Game."
29625,"I bought this awhile back and only got the free time to download this today and I immediately got hooked, looking forward into diving further into each aspect of the game."
29626,"Quite possibly the best city builder I have ever played,  Highly recommended!

If you enjoy a city builder that is both relaxing but also complex then this is the game for you. I found myself often lost for hours whilst playing Skylines, mainly due to my need to plan everything down to the smallest detail, but this game will allow you to go all out crazy or deep into planing central. It also has a wonderful workshop filled with thousands of Items and amazing mods to enhance your game play further. What is not to love about it!"
29627,yes
29628,It's really nice
29629,very good
29630,Fun game
29631,good game to build your own city to your own  image
29632,"With some essential DLC (namely, Mass Transit, Parklife and After Dark) it's the best modern city building game on the market. Vanilla, not so much. It will be hard to replace even with C:S 2."
29633,I've been playing for 175.6 days straight... I can't stop... Send help!
29634,Love playing this Game to calm down. Would recommend. 👍
29635,Good
29636,A little overpriced with all the dlcs but its a good game.
29637,"aaahhh this is a game that need a strategic mind, but its kinda chill and fun to moderating a city in this game, you gotta make sure the people are happy, away from industries, near the shops and malls, traffic jam, water, electricity, everything, make sure they are good, so you can earn money, also you can play with unlimited money but you won't feel challenging with this mode."
29638,BEST GAME EVER!!!
29639,Yeah it's alright.
29640,hi
29641,"fun game, relaxing."
29642,A really fun game to pass the time. Hours fly by without knowing.
29643,This is a really fun game
29644,"I have spent way too much time in this game but I feel like I could still remember every city I’ve built. 

The simple mechanics of playing with water, ground, and city assets is enough for anyone who likes city design at all. Also this is different than sims because you don’t control individual people. I recommend this to anyone who thinks about parks, roads and bridges way too much. 

The base game is great, but adding workshop mods and assets can make it extremely realistic. It does take many hours to design realistic cities in this way, though. I usually would just load up as many mods as I could and then use them until my PC froze and then delete them all. Lol. They’re free. 

This is still a game though, not a simulator. There is no way to make the money meter go away. (Actually maybe a mod will do it). 

Exactly the kind of game you expect. I have no complaints."
29645,Good game
29646,"If you like perfection and like Structure and organization along with constantly improving things. This is a game for you.

This Steam Workshop https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2200061232 will help you jump start your game play.

Along with that Youtube https://www.youtube.com/c/ACityPlannerPlaysCityBuilders/playlists has many videos to help point you in the correct direction."
29647,A brilliant city building game
29648,Very good game for chiling
29649,"I first purchased Cities around this time last year for the PS4, but no matter how much extra content i purchased i just couldn't get things to look the way i wanted after watching what people were doing with their cities on Youtube. So this year i stopped watching & started learning how to build a PC & at last have downloaded the lot with many mods, I also got a few Blender skills & hoping to bring somethings to the table too. Much love to everyone involved with this game"
29650,Extremely nice city builder with a lot of extra content (either paid with DLCs and even more free content on the workshop).
29651,Gud gem
29652,tutorial how to be a president. buy this game. good game you gotta take the loan if you cannot handle the stress at the early stage and run your city efficiently as you can every percent tax is matter and the future impact is no joke. if you havent play this type of game before. you need to watch some tutor on youtube. orrr you'll face bankruptcy real quick ended up wasting your time. and ofc best management tactic in this game is to keep everything tight as possible do not spend too much money on park. those thing are useless for money maker. anyway gg..
29653,"Fun but require patience until you get uSed to it.
"
29654,all time best city simulation!!!
29655,The best city builder out there.
29656,worse than heroin+ketamine addiction
29657,"This game is fantastic. 

Excellent for building a city exactly how you'd want it, as well as living out your city planner dream.

Adore the visuals, the constant DLC and updates; Colossal Order and Paradox are doing a stunning job!"
29658,Game is great. Fun to play and relaxing at the same time
29659,"Very well developed and visually detailed game, but tbh it's engine sucks - we need C:S 2 on modern engine"
29660,most satisfying game ever.. 1st time played cracked version of this game but after a while i decided to buy it :)
29661,The best game to just sit down and relax for hours. Strongly recommend!
29662,The mod and the DLC keep me coming back from time to time.
29663,"Great city builder game, tons of mods to never get bored."
29664,Greatest city planning game ever ever ever.

29666,Of course yes
29667,This is the best cities building simulation game ever. Some DLC of this game is definitely game changing.
29668,good game to play and chill.
29669,Very fun and addictive. Some might say too addictive. Even without DLCs the game can be extremely fun. The only bad thing I can really think of is the fact that the game is really demanding on the computer CPU.
29670,Yes.
29671,"Amazing. I can actually put hours into this game in one session and get completely absorbed into it. The gameplay is absolutely amazing. At the game you start with 70K (or unlimited if you choose that mod), and have to build your city on that. First itll be hard to make money, but once you get the industry going it'll gradually get easier. The only problem me and most people encounter is that the larger the city gets the more traffic you get. Even with mods this can be extremely hard, but not impossible."
29672,Build ur country
29673,"I love this game and its workshop creators, and i will continue to love it for the many more hours."
29674,I really like this game
29675,This is one of the games of my dreams! I enjoy the city builder genre and enjoy playing this CS. It is a great modding game as well as a great simulation game. It is a great way to create anything that would be desired in a city and expand creativity.
29676,Not owned by EA.
29677,Nice
29678,"Best game in terms of simulation of City
Must buy."
29679,Amazingly detailed and fun city builder
29680,"I recommend this game.

* This review will be updated further on *"

29682,Hours of labor for the goal of perfection. Which never happens..
29683,Im in love with this game! its so much fun. its even better with the dlc they added!
29684,"My favorite city building game yet, the population stats could be more accurate but it's fine I guess. But also it is very difficult to make so there are enough goods to sell, I have seen other people complain about it too."
29685,bagos
29686,"good game, pls get if you like urban planning."
29687,"Cities Skylines is truly an immersive experience in what it means to be a city planner. You dive into the complexity of city management and development through various ways while discovering yourself and how you envision your dream city. The developers continiously work to improve the game mechanics while bringing the community new content. It can be seen just through their social media that they have a real connection with their players as every other month there is always something new to present or collaboration projects that inspire all. I am truly thankful to be a part of this community, to be able to play such an amazing game, and to leave behind SimCity (lol)."
29688,Best for a relaxing evening.
29689,"There never seems to be enough time to play it, but I always enjoy it, when ever I do come round to playing it!"
29690,EPIC
29691,THE WEAK WILL PERISH
29692,"Its a game for one who want to relax and feel how it is to build a town/city. Main vanilla is good, if got extra money, buy the dlc, if not stick with the vanilla assets."
29693,Nice ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)
29694,Good game.
29695,Najlepsza gra w jaką grałem !!
29696,Probably the game that I like the most but am garbage at anyways.
29697,"Great game, can play it endlessly"
29698,"Sim City seems to have yielded the crown. Cities is not a perfect game. In fact, years later, there remain issues that have been here since launch. Still, it's the best we've got and not bad at that."
29699,"Great game to play, you can get easily bored if playing too much. But all in all, much fun."
29700,Great game to relax and enjoy
29701,good game
29702,Awesome! I think i'm ready to be a mayor now :D
29703,loved it
29704,Like a modernized much better version of Sim City 4
29705,"great playability and attention to detail as well.

Once you have played with it, you just can't stop playing."
29708,I love this game so much. I could spend hours building cities!
29709,I really love this game. It help me to relax. ☺️
29710,Yey!
29711,"Best city builder I've ever played, also the built-in support for the community content offers a huge variety,"
29712,"If you like city builders, you'll love this game. A lot of customization possible because of the workshop but even vanilla has a lot to give. But be carefull: the more assets from the workshop you use, the more RAM you'll need."
29713,very engrossing game
29714,Very good game. Great wase of my free time.
29715,it is ok
29716,"A fun city building experience that provides endless hours of entertainment. There is always something new to discover! The DLC's add a rich and robust experience to gameplay, I would highly recommend this game."
29717,"Great game! There are endless possibilities and the steam workshop is still alive and well. Creators constantly add new DLCs and content to the game, and even playing without any DLC is still a fun time. This is the perfect game for people who want to experience what it's like to be a city planner, urban engineer, architect, etc. Do beware, this game requires a decent computer to run, and there may be some mods that can and will help with your gameplay experience that I also highly recommend (TM:PE, NEXt and Road Anarchy)."
29718,The first time I played this game I stayed up until 6 in the morning on accident.
29719,Great!
29720,good
29721,As good as it gets for a city simulator...for now. Must play if you like the SimCity franchise.
29722,"The most intrinsically complex and yet approachable city builder out there. When it came out, it put SimCity to shame and showed it how it's done. Add a massive workshop with a never-ending supply of custom assets and this game becomes a devourer of daylight hours... in a good way!"
29723,It's simply the best city building game.
29724,Awesome game. Definitely prefer this over SimCity.
29725,nice
29726,I fucking hate dams. 11/10
29727,very good
29728,Oddly difficult to get started.  Forced to sign up for an account for marketing.  Got stuck with weird window laying and had to google how to just accept the privacy agreement.  No useful tips or tutorials for getting started. Aren't games supposed to be fun?
29729,"Still awesome! Still everything you know,.. -that- ""sim-ulation city"" builder should have been, and then some. Getting better with every dlc. Recommending this ultimate city builder 10/10."
29730,"Literally THE BEST City builder. This game is one of these game I will always come back to. If you are into sandbox type games, get it!"
29731,Still a great game but no as fun to play if you don't buy at least some DLCs which are a bit overpriced I feel.
29732,This game is just amazing. I love it.
29733,"Best City Builder currently available. There is no other game that could match Cities Skylines in terms of complexity, size, performance, visuals and usability, especially with mods and DLC's."
29734,Very nice game. Better than the new simcity
29735,A cure for boredom
29736,Beautiful Game
29737,"Just the best modern city building sim so far!
Good DLCs also."
29738,I'm only writing this for the Fall sale achievement :)
29739,"I recommend you to buy radio dlc because the only music in the game can be annoying. It is very nice to have details in the game and I suggest you download a few modes in the workshop. You should definitely play. Don't pay too much tax in the city, it can get you angry and leave the city."
29740,Cities Skylines is the best city-building game and very good mods with a strong and active comunity.
29741,It's a game that never gets old.
29742,Good Game
29743,the university dedicated to the lost ball
29744,Very good game and you can clearly see that the game is made by paradox. if you have creativity you can make some amazing stuff.
29745,GG
29746,"This game once you learn how to play it is a very enjoyable and one of the best game of its type, paradox did a amazing job with this game. the only down side is that the DLC makes the game more relalistic and is locked behind a pay wall so get this game on a sale with the DLC of you're choosing"
29747,"So far my only problem with the game is the lack of a tutorial. As you expand your city, the game doesn't really tell you how to do things such as how to get more raw resources. I find myself turning to google for answers to this and to why places have no power despite my production being 3 times my consumption."
29748,good
29749,One of the best city building games there is. Also a lot of dlc-s.
29750,Very detailed and with mods which you can get free really good
29751,best game ever
29752,good
29753,very good game
29754,"not a lot really needs to be said about this game.
build and expand..... then spend the rest of your time managing traffic. 
download mods to help deal with traffic...
build new roads and use public transport to deal with traffic...
Go from low density buildings to high density and deal with more traffic...
Power is needed and water as the place expands. 
noise and ground pollution become a problem and civs get sick.
more facilities are needed like hospitals and other health care.
this means more traffic
shops are needed, which means industry is needed and then more houses needed to fill the jobs = more traffic
think you get the point.
BTW if you get 100k civs in a world, well done. high five from me!
"
29755,Melhor Game
29756,"Easily the best City Building simulator out there in the vain of the late, great Simcity's of the past (RIP). Even with just the vanilla game there is plenty of content to sink your teeth into and the tutorials are detailed enough to teach as you play all the basics. As for the DLC's, most of which are great, just avoid the Radio Stations, which honestly aren't generally worth your time unless you really want a new few tracks to listen to.

Anyhow that all being said I highly recommend this game and believe it's perfect for any city building fans out there. It doesn't get much better then this!"
29757,Amazing game
29758,good game
29759,"What can I say? Undisputed best city-building game.
It arrived at the moment we needed it most, it felt complete at the time of release, and they've kept adding to it and improving both with free updates and expansions that you can pick and choose how to customise your experience but never feel like you are missing out without them. If that wasn't enough there is a very healthy modding community that the devs openly support without trying to turn into a microtransactions store or anything like that."
29760,"The pristine city builder! The community and developers for this game are as active as ever, curating new content for this ever expanding game."
29761,"It's graphics are under-estimated. When building it is nothing except amazing! The gameplay still makes it, what I would call it, the best City-builder yet!"
29762,macht Bock
29763,i love this game it is so much fun and the graphics are insane
29764,Thanks for keeping my soul at bay when it had nowhere to go
29765,One of the best city builder games.
29766,Best game of building ever ever ever
29767,"I love it! Five stars out of five. I don't want to type up a review, I just want to play the game already!"
29768,gude
29769,"Chill and Relax, can spend so much time into this game."
29770,:)
29771,"I have logged thousands of hours in this, because I just find it relaxing. I run the game modded, trying to create realistic cities.  Traffic is still the number one difficulty in the game, and in too many cases the game breaks down into a traffic simulator. Still, with the public transit system and road layout, those problems can be solved. I especially like the Industries DLC, but would like to be able to have more control about what goods or materials are shipped to what special factory. I'll sometimes have a balanced warehouse of glass, right next to a factory that says it needs glass, and trucks will instead drive halfway across town to deliver glass.

On the whole, though, this game has been out for years, and will likely hold up for many more."
29772,I'm addicted
29773,"what can i say, a man has fallen into the river in Lego city and you're laughing?"
29774,"Make sure to install some essential mods to improve the AI, traffic, visuals and the overall experience, and you'll be playing for hours without even realizing. Building your own city from the ground up and watching it grow overtime is so satisfying. The game's attention to detail is incredible and designing your own city is seriously a very fun and creative experience. Just buy the game."
29775,Very engaging and keeps being interesting and evolving
29776,"Best city builder out there. The only downside is how much RAM this game requires for assets but that's only a complaint if you use a lot of mods. Either way, optimization of the game's code is much needed and I hope paradox updates the game before adding more DLCs without having a game capable of running them."
29777,It's not easy to be a town creator..
29778,Better than SimCity 2014
29779,pretty good
29780,great game
29781,My hardon grows at the same pace as my city.
29782,A great game even without the DLC if you are a cityy builder fan.
29783,Kinda sleeper
29784,good spel man
29785,Is very fun
29786,"It has been my favourite game to play since July now, it is delightfully hard for me to manage traffic, and I love the community behind the game, supporting it with a ton of great mods and youtube videos."
29787,"I've had a great game, even without the expansions. The only problem I've had is that my computer seems a little too weak."
29788,So good game! Nice!!! I recommend it!
29789,"Somewhere back in 2016 I bought cities skylines as it was back then a popular city builder game. After having played simcity i really got fascinated how paradox interactive reincarnated city simulator games. Today its been around 4 years since i have the game with on my account being 270+ hours and here is what i found good and bad about the game.

To start of I bought the game back in 2016 shortly before the snowfall DLC. With a 2012 Windows 8 computer I was capable to play the game until 2018. Somewhere around that time a DLC came out that finally terminated my computer from being able to cope with the game. In fact it didnt really matter if the city had a population of about 70000 or 3500 people. It was mostly because of mods and the new content that added up to the pile of slowing down my computer. I suppose that today the game wouldnt be still playable on a Windows 8 computer with all the mods off but thats only a suggestion i have on base of a trend that my pc was following when it came to performance. 

Today as I write this review I have a newer computer (Acer Nitro) I can say that the game is moving along with modern technology, newer and better computers. The game runs very smooth with minimal to no lag caused by graphics. However cities is in fact a game with plenty of AI that needs processing power and RAM to be able to function. Regarding assets I would suggest that 800 assets is about the best performance maximum you could get to run the game smoothly. Regarding mods I would stick with up to 30 active mods to not have the RAM start baking burgers.

Shortly said a few Pros and Cons are

Pros +:
Game is up to date
Realistic (well mostly in compared with other city builders)
A huge diversity of assets and mods
An enormous community
Low graphic usage

Cons -:
definitively not a game for a 2012 computer or older
the addiction of adding more and more assets and mods causing the game to lose on performance (Steam Exclusive)
generally a high RAM required (but that is because of mods and assets)
A few features that are not included on the steam version that do appear on console (in my case the PS4)

Conclusion overall I still find Cities a game still worthy its content and diversity which has been implemented into the game. Therefor I do recommend it to friends and others that have a good taste for simulator games and a good computer."
29790,yes.
29791,"C:S, a cozy room, a warm drink, and your favorite podcast; these are the ingredients for a perfect afternoon"
29792,"Best city building game out there at the moment. Some really relaxing fun to be had. Can also become challenging.

So far I am really happy with this game!"
29793,"If you like cityville (old game on facebook), then this is the best yet!

29794,Still going strong.
29795,This is a very nice game... Though it can be a tad addictive to get that traffic going just right...

29799,"Came back to playing after over 1 year break, it's as amazing as I remembered. Love it"
29800,i like it
29801,"Miss Risma Simulator , 10/10"
29802,sit and relax
29803,"Literally the best city builder ever created so far, you will have endless hours on this."
29804,I seem to enjoy it
29805,"When you buy the base game it's just so fascinating to see your city grow and your citizens move around. And the fact that it has such an active community that provide such an abundance of mods and assets really make it worth the buy. However, most of the expansion packs really don't add much to the game unless you're willing to spend hours going through the workshop and subscribing to everything.

I do like that they eventually implement the most popular mods into the base game every few updates so it shows they still care for the vanilla experience.

Summary: For casuals, just buy the base game and some transport expansions if you really want to. For die hards, it's a no brainer. BUY BUY BUY!!!"
29806,cant get my game started
29807,"it's been quite some time since i last play this, dev added so much more contents and they're so much better than last i played"
29808,"Ahhh yes, my favorite city building game where, the traffic is a mess, and people are suffering from a disease with no explanation at all. 

10/10 would order a meteorite to strike the elderly home again."
29809,I love pollution
29810,"its really good and creative
"
29811,ii very good game
29812,"Fun game, ıve watched a lot of this game and finally played it. Vey addicting"
29813,yes
29814,"Quite possibly the best city building game ever. There is so much to do, and it is all so much fun. Personally, I prefer playing within the constraints of the game, but you could also build a city just for the fun of it - without money constraints - and watch the city simulation.

I also like that the developers have continued to work on this game for their different updates; although their pricing for DLCs is pretty steep. As a fan of transit systems, it is no surprise my favourite DLC is Mass Transit. The ability to mod and create custom assets has produced a wealth of community-created tweaks."
29815,A good city building game.
29816,u must play. this game is so amazing
29817,menjadi gubernur
29818,"Build a city
watch them getting mad
go bankrupt
start again"
29819,"Best city building game I have ever played, mod support is amazing."
29820,"Sadly after EA killed SimCity, its the one of the best city builders here on market. With such a massive amount of community made content, you can have a lot of diverse content without paying for DLC. In terms of DLCs itself, there are many worth buying, but some are not worth their full price at all. Summing it all up, its a great fucking game and theres no reason for you to not have it yet"
29821,yes.
29822,Better than simcity
29823,"This is a great game to play and lose yourself into via the vanilla version, To make an already great game better, you can add mods of all different kinds, from roads to props to buildings. I highly suggest this game!"
29824,THIs GAME GOTTA GET AN AWARDS!!
29825,I made a city
29826,So much freedom and options to build your city as you will. Highly recommended if you're into the city building genre!
29827,"Love me a 80% traffic flow, sue me."
29828,Very good and fun but traffic could be better.
29829,"It's one of if not the best ""management"" game out there. I step back and try other games but nothing tops the functionality and dare I say ""simplicity"" of this game. Compared to something like Simcity and other building games, this one definitely takes the cake with the way you're able to expand. They incorporated all the best parts of city building without making super realistic with politics and whatnot. A need to try for anyone that likes city building or even just basic management.

p.s it's pretty much a road building simulator XD"
29830,good
29831,Make Cities: Skylines 2!
29832,"my go to relaxing game.
it doesn't matter if it's creative mode or challenge mode, i never get tierd of creating the perfect city."
29833,Thee best city builder ever created. Periodt.
29834,it's alright
29835,I used to play SimCity religiously and have moved over to City Skylines. Great game and great interface. Worth the money and have enjoyed many hours playing this game. This is a must if you enjoy SimCity.
29836,Quite the fun game.  Not so much an ideological explorer as much as a Capitalist Democracy builder.
29837,my favorite game by far
29838,"Even after playing this game for over five hundred hours on and off over multiple years, I still find myself returning to build my dream cities."
29839,Great game.
29840,Great casual game for passing the time with some deeper mechanics if you want to explore them.
29841,Good
29842,Addicting game
29843,The best city builder I have ever played. The best part is how much modding support there is and extra content through the steam workshop. Definitely a must have if you're into city builders.
29844,really good shit right there
29845,Best City Building game ever!
29846,"A very entertaining game. I am so glad that mods are a thing in this game, without it this game would be stressful. 
The visuals are very good. 

:)"
29847,Great replacement for the much beloved Sim City 4!
29848,"I can't really say for sure why I don't like this game, but the fact remains that I don't.  It's not an aversion to city building per se, as I thoroughly enjoy Banished, but somehow this game doesn't have the fun factor that Banished does.

Maybe it's that my citizens aren't starving or freezing to death, or being crushed by falling rocks in the quarry?  Maybe it's not having the excitement of seeing the trade ship showing up only to see they have nothing but the same chickens you didn't want last year....or the year before.

Or maybe it's an interface that's more frustration than fun, with roads that don't snap together right, and traffic/lane controls that never do what you want.  Perhaps some of those things are solved in DLCs, but why should one have to pay extra in the hope it might make an otherwise frustrating game fun?  Shouldn't games be fun to start with?"
29849,Like Sim City!!
29850,"Great city builder, though it has some quirks. Would be nice to have a new edition of the game that allows for larger and more populated cities."
29851,great city building game.
29852,those kind of sitback and chill and have fun kinda games :D
29853,This game brings hours of enjoyment. Before you know it time will get away from you. Kudos guys great game.
29854,"Very good game, keeps you busy for hours, can be tricky sometimes but it gets the mindset going.
Would definitely recommend to those interested in city building, city management e.t.c"
29855,"Real good !



"
29856,Build a City they said. 20 Minutes later ... call a Meteor
29857,Good game.
29858,"LO RECONTRA PIRATIE PERO ME GUSTA IGUAL, SALEN MUY CAROS TODOS LOS DLCS COMO 2000 PESOS"
29859,Best Game
29860,"If you like city builder, JUST GO!!"
29861,I have this for both the Ps4 and Pc .My husband n loves it just as much as I do after I showed gameplay .It has its corks but all in all very fun to play .
29862,"Extremely addictive, dev's keep this game up to date or at least providing DLC's, mod community is vast and fills the voids in building the perfect metropolis"
29863,"It's a great time-waster game, but thank god for that one humble bundle that included all of the DLCs, I am not made of money."
29864,Best city builder until now.
29865,good
29866,It really makes me feel like Kim Jong-Un
29867,Its fun but be prepared with the launcher
29868,"I've played city builders since SimCity was released for the Amiga, and loved them ever since. The Cities franchise and Skylines in particular are the worthy successors to that idea. Love it."
29869,Always fun and a nice way to quietly spend time.
29870,fun
29871,game
29872,"Simply the best management game ever. There we go! I said it. Plenty of opportunities to explore and customize, build and destroy. Khm. I mean redesign. Tutorials are easy to follow and giving you enough to start the city of your dreams! Perhaps it may seem it's a bit short on the maps but surely you can spend hours and hours as a newcomer to the genre, as a casual fan of the city building games or as a hardcore town planner. There is loads of workshop items and inspiration available from the helpful and lovely community. Brilliant game! And more and more content is coming with the expansion packs on their way. Literally I can't wait to see what comes next!
Another year has passed since I voted last time, in 2020 for Steam Awards this masterpiece, and I still come back to play!"
29873,SWEET JEBUS
29874,"If you like city builders, there is absolutely no way around Cities: Skylines and the fact that there is a very active modder community makes this even so much more better."
29875,Traffic Simulator with $200 of DLC. Buy Surviving Mars or Banished instead.
29876,"i complained about traffic when going to school today.
i decided i could build a better city with much less traffic in this game.
i was wrong."
29877,love
29878,"If you like tycoon games, are a city planner, or just want to watch a city grow, this game is for you. The game alone is good, but mods make it 10x better IMO"
29879,"great city builder
"
29880,"Very good game man, I swear it,"
29881,"Way better than SimCity. I've played so many hours of this game
"
29882,If you're vaguely interested in city planning and public transport — this is the game for you.
29883,super adictive! Love it!
29884,great game buy it
29885,fun
29886,yeah
29887,Yes.
29888,ok game
29889,great game
29890,haha city go brrrr
29891,A very addictive game game if you love city building. Ive been playing it since 2015 and never got bored with it once.
29892,"Im so confused all the time. Nothing I do makes sense anymore. yet, I will keep playing... forever"
29893,Great game and continued support. I see quite a few reviews that complain about the buying the DLCs but I view it as extending the life and replayability of a great game. I'd rather pay $14 for new content on a game I can keep playing and enjoy that $60 for a new game that i might not like. Only complaint is how it slows my tower down. Spec wise the requirements and recommendations are far exceeded but get to around 100k people and it seems like it puts the brakes on.
29894,Traffic just annoying. That`s all. Love the rest.
29895,nice
29896,after sitting in traffic to get home i can sit down and watch tiny simulated people suffer through the monstrosity of a road system that i have created
29897,Very well made game
29898,Cool game 👍
